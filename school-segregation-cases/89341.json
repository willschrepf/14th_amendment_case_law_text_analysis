Argued December 4, 2006—Decided June 28, 2007*\nRespondent school districts voluntarily adopted student assignment\n  plans that rely on race to determine which schools certain children\n  may attend. The Seattle district, which has never operated legally\n  segregated schools or been subject to court-ordered desegregation,\n  classified children as white or nonwhite, and used the racial classifi\n  cations as a “tiebreaker” to allocate slots in particular high schools.\n  The Jefferson County, Ky., district was subject to a desegregation de\n  cree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after\n  finding that the district had eliminated the vestiges of prior segrega\n  tion to the greatest extent practicable. In 2001, the district adopted\n  its plan classifying students as black or “other” in order to make cer\n  tain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests.\n     Petitioners, an organization of Seattle parents (Parents Involved)\n  and the mother of a Jefferson County student (Joshua), whose chil\n  dren were or could be assigned under the foregoing plans, filed these\n  suits contending, inter alia, that allocating children to different pub\n  lic schools based solely on their race violates the Fourteenth Amend\n  ment’s equal protection guarantee. In the Seattle case, the District\n  Court granted the school district summary judgment, finding, inter\n  alia, that its plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitu\n  tional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling\n  government interest. The Ninth Circuit affirmed. In the Jefferson\n  County case, the District Court found that the school district had as\n——————\n  * Together with No. 05–915, Meredith, Custodial Parent and Next\nFriend of McDonald v.

NO. 1\n\n                          Syllabus \n\n\n    serted a compelling interest in maintaining racially diverse schools,\n    and that its plan was, in all relevant respects, narrowly tailored to\n    serve that interest. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.\nHeld: The judgments are reversed, and the cases are remanded.\nNo. 05–908, 426 F. 3d 1162; No. 05–915, 416 F. 3d 513, reversed and\n remanded.\n    THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect\n to Parts I, II, III–A, and III–C, concluding:\n    1. The Court has jurisdiction in these cases. Seattle argues that\n Parents Involved lacks standing because its current members’\n claimed injuries are not imminent and are too speculative in that,\n even if the district maintains its current plan and reinstitutes the ra\n cial tiebreaker, those members will only be affected if their children\n seek to enroll in a high school that is oversubscribed and integration\n positive. This argument is unavailing; the group’s members have\n children in all levels of the district’s schools, and the complaint\n sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of members whose\n elementary and middle school children may be denied admission to\n the high schools of their choice in the future. The fact that those\n children may not be denied such admission based on their race be\n cause of undersubscription or oversubscription that benefits them\n does not eliminate the injury claimed. The group also asserted an in\n terest in not being forced to compete in a race-based system that\n might prejudice its members’ children, an actionable form of injury\n under the Equal Protection Clause, see, e.g., Adarand Constructors,\n Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 211. The fact that Seattle has ceased us\n ing the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome here is not dispositive,\n since the district vigorously defends its program’s constitutionality,\n and nowhere suggests that it will not resume using race to assign\n students if it prevails. See Friends of Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envi\n ronmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U. S. 167, 189. Similarly, the\n fact that Joshua has been granted a transfer does not eliminate the\n Court’s jurisdiction; Jefferson County’s racial guidelines apply at all\n grade levels and he may again be subject to race-based assignment in\n middle school. Pp. 9–11.\n    2. The school districts have not carried their heavy burden of show\n ing that the interest they seek to achieve justifies the extreme means\n they have chosen—discriminating among individual students based\n on race by relying upon racial classifications in making school as\n signments. Pp. 11–17, 25–28.\n    (a) Because “racial classifications are simply too pernicious to per\n mit any but the most exact connection between justification and clas\n sification,” Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 537 (STEVENS, J.,\n dissenting), governmental distributions of burdens or benefits based\n\f                   Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                      3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\non individual racial classifications are reviewed under strict scrutiny,\ne.g., Johnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 505–506. Thus, the school\ndistricts must demonstrate that their use of such classifications is\n“narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compelling” government interest.\nAdarand, supra, at 227.\n   Although remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination\nis a compelling interest under the strict scrutiny test, see Freeman v.\nPitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494, that interest is not involved here because\nthe Seattle schools were never segregated by law nor subject to court-\nordered desegregation, and the desegregation decree to which the Jef\nferson County schools were previously subject has been dissolved.\nMoreover, these cases are not governed by Grutter v. Bollinger, 539\nU. S. 306, 328, in which the Court held that, for strict scrutiny pur\nposes, a government interest in student body diversity “in the context\nof higher education” is compelling. That interest was not focused on\nrace alone but encompassed “all factors that may contribute to stu\ndent body diversity,” id., at 337, including, e.g., having “overcome\npersonal adversity and family hardship,” id., at 338. Quoting Justice\nPowell’s articulation of diversity in Regents of the University of Cali\nfornia v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 314–315, the Grutter Court noted that\n“ ‘it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified\npercentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members\nof selected ethnic groups,’ that can justify the use of race,” 539 U. S.,\nat 324–325, but “ ‘a far broader array of qualifications and character\nistics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important\nelement, ’ ” id., at 325. In the present cases, by contrast, race is not\nconsidered as part of a broader effort to achieve “exposure to widely\ndiverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,” id., at 330; race, for\nsome students, is determinative standing alone. The districts argue\nthat other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment de\ncisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into\nplay, it is decisive by itself. It is not simply one factor weighed with\nothers in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it is the factor. See Gratz\nv. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 275. Even as to race, the plans here em\nploy only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in\nwhite/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/“other” terms in Jefferson\nCounty. The Grutter Court expressly limited its holding—defining a\nspecific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context\nof higher education—but these limitations were largely disregarded\nby the lower courts in extending Grutter to the sort of classifications\nat issue here. Pp. 11–17.\n      (b) Despite the districts’ assertion that they employed individual\nracial classifications in a way necessary to achieve their stated ends,\nthe minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments\n\f4         PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                  SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    suggests that other means would be effective. Seattle’s racial tie\n    breaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of stu\n    dents between schools. Similarly, Jefferson County admits that its\n    use of racial classifications has had a minimal effect, and claims only\n    that its guidelines provide a firm definition of the goal of racially in\n    tegrated schools, thereby providing administrators with authority to\n    collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the\n    desired range. Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to\n    a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of this\n    Court’s precedents and the Nation’s history of using race in public\n    schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.\n    In Grutter, in contrast, the consideration of race was viewed as indis\n    pensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law\n    school there at issue. See 539 U. S., at 320. While the Court does not\n    suggest that greater use of race would be preferable, the minimal im\n    pact of the districts’ racial classifications on school enrollment casts\n    doubt on the necessity of using such classifications. The districts\n    have also failed to show they considered methods other than explicit\n    racial classifications to achieve their stated goals. Narrow tailoring\n    requires “serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\n    alternatives,” id., at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative as\n    signment plans—many of which would not have used express racial\n    classifications—were rejected with little or no consideration. Jeffer\n    son County has failed to present any evidence that it considered al\n    ternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are\n    achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifica\n    tions. Pp. 25–28.\n       THE CHIEF JUSTICE, joined by JUSTICE SCALIA, JUSTICE THOMAS, and\n    JUSTICE ALITO, concluded for additional reasons in Parts III–B and IV\n    that the plans at issue are unconstitutional under this Court’s prece\n    dents. Pp. 17–25, 28–41.\n       1. The Court need not resolve the parties’ dispute over whether ra\n    cial diversity in schools has a marked impact on test scores and other\n    objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits be\n    cause it is clear that the racial classifications at issue are not nar\n    rowly tailored to the asserted goal. In design and operation, the\n    plans are directed only to racial balance, an objective this Court has\n    repeatedly condemned as illegitimate. They are tied to each district’s\n    specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of\n    the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational bene\n    fits. Whatever those demographics happen to be drives the required\n    “diversity” number in each district. The districts offer no evidence\n    that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted\n    educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demograph\n\f                    Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                      5\n\n                               Syllabus\n\nics of the respective districts, or rather the districts’ white/nonwhite\nor black/“other” balance, since that is the only diversity addressed by\nthe plans. In Grutter, the number of minority students the school\nsought to admit was an undefined “meaningful number” necessary to\nachieve a genuinely diverse student body, 539 U. S., at 316, 335–336,\nand the Court concluded that the law school did not count back from\nits applicant pool to arrive at that number, id., at 335–336. Here, in\ncontrast, the schools worked backward to achieve a particular type of\nracial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstra\ntion of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits.\nThis is a fatal flaw under the Court’s existing precedent. See, e.g.,\nFreeman, supra, at 494. Accepting racial balancing as a compelling\nstate interest would justify imposing racial proportionality through\nout American society, contrary to the Court’s repeated admonitions\nthat this is unconstitutional. While the school districts use various\nverbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promote—\nracial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration—they\noffer no definition suggesting that their interest differs from racial\nbalancing. Pp. 17–25.\n   2. If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school\ndistricts is unclear, even on the districts’ own terms, the costs are\nundeniable. Government action dividing people by race is inherently\nsuspect because such classifications promote “notions of racial inferi\nority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,” Croson, supra, at 493,\n“reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history,\nthat individuals should be judged by the color of their skin,” Shaw v.\nReno, 509 U. S. 630, 657, and “endorse race-based reasoning and the\nconception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to\nan escalation of racial hostility and conflict,” Metro Broadcasting, Inc.\nv. FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 603 (O’Connor, J., dissenting). When it comes\nto using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard. In\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, the Court held that seg\nregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities\nregardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were\nequal, because the classification and separation themselves denoted\ninferiority. Id., at 493–494. It was not the inequality of the facilities\nbut the fact of legally separating children based on race on which the\nCourt relied to find a constitutional violation in that case. Id., at 494.\nThe districts here invoke the ultimate goal of those who filed Brown\nand subsequent cases to support their argument, but the argument of\nthe plaintiff in Brown was that the Equal Protection Clause “pre\nvents states from according differential treatment to American chil\ndren on the basis of their color or race,” and that view prevailed—this\nCourt ruled in its remedial opinion that Brown required school dis\n\f6         PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                  SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                           Syllabus \n\n\n    tricts “to achieve a system of determining admission to the public\n    schools on a nonracial basis.” Brown v. Board of Education, 349\n    U. S. 294, 300–301 (emphasis added). Pp. 28–41.\n       JUSTICE KENNEDY agreed that the Court has jurisdiction to decide\n    these cases and that respondents’ student assignment plans are not\n    narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling goal of diversity properly\n    defined, but concluded that some parts of the plurality opinion imply\n    an unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances\n    when it may be taken into account. Pp. 1–9.\n       (a) As part of its burden of proving that racial classifications are\n    narrowly tailored to further compelling interests, the government\n    must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual stu\n    dent’s race are made in a challenged program. The Jefferson County\n    Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate when it con\n    cedes it denied Joshua’s requested kindergarten transfer on the basis\n    of his race under its guidelines, yet also maintains that the guide\n    lines do not apply to kindergartners. This discrepancy is not some\n    simple and straightforward error that touches only upon the periph\n    eries of the district’s use of individual racial classifications. As be\n    comes clearer when the district’s plan is further considered, Jefferson\n    County has explained how and when it employs these classifications\n    only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand\n    strict scrutiny. In its briefing it fails to make clear—even in the lim\n    ited respects implicated by Joshua’s initial assignment and transfer\n    denial—whether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner\n    narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-\n    reaching, inconsistent, and ad hoc manner that a less forgiving read\n    ing of the record would suggest. When a court subjects governmental\n    action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the\n    government. In the Seattle case, the school district has gone further\n    in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment\n    decisions based on individual racial classifications, but it has never\n    theless failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of\n    races, with only a minority of the students classified as “white,” it has\n    employed the crude racial categories of “white” and “non-white” as\n    the basis for its assignment decisions. Far from being narrowly tai\n    lored, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the district\n    has provided no convincing explanation for its design. Pp. 2–6.\n       (b) The plurality opinion is too dismissive of government’s legiti\n    mate interest in ensuring that all people have equal opportunity re\n    gardless of their race. In administering public schools, it is permissi\n    ble to consider the schools’ racial makeup and adopt general policies\n    to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial\n    composition. Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306. School authori\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

Such measures may include\n  strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with\n  general recognition of neighborhood demographics; allocating re\n  sources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a tar\n  geted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other sta\n  tistics by race.\n     Each respondent has failed to provide the necessary support for the\n  proposition that there is no other way than individual racial classifi\n  cations to avoid racial isolation in their school districts. Cf. Rich\n  mond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 501. In these cases, the fact\n  that the number of students whose assignment depends on express\n  racial classifications is small suggests that the schools could have\n  achieved their stated ends through different means, including the fa\n  cially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nu\n  anced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteris\n  tics that might include race as a component. The latter approach\n  would be informed by Grutter, though the criteria relevant to student\n  placement would differ based on the students’ age, the parents’\n  needs, and the schools’ role.

In Jefferson\nCounty, it is used to make certain elementary school\nassignments and to rule on transfer requests. In each\ncase, the school district relies upon an individual student’s\nrace in assigning that student to a particular school, so\nthat the racial balance at the school falls within a prede\ntermined range based on the racial composition of the\nschool district as a whole. Parents of students denied\nassignment to particular schools under these plans solely\nbecause of their race brought suit, contending that allocat\ning children to different public schools on the basis of race\nviolated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal\nprotection. The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans.\nWe granted certiorari, and now reverse.\n                             I\n  Both cases present the same underlying legal question—\nwhether a public school that had not operated legally\nsegregated schools or has been found to be unitary may\nchoose to classify students by race and rely upon that\nclassification in making school assignments. Although we\nexamine the plans under the same legal framework, the\nspecifics of the two plans, and the circumstances\nsurrounding their adoption, are in some respects quite\ndifferent.\n                            A\n  Seattle School District No. 1 operates 10 regular public\nhigh schools.

If too many\nstudents list the same school as their first choice, the\ndistrict employs a series of “tiebreakers” to determine who\nwill fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school. The\nfirst tiebreaker selects for admission students who have a\nsibling currently enrolled in the chosen school. The next\ntiebreaker depends upon the racial composition of the\nparticular school and the race of the individual student.\nIn the district’s public schools approximately 41 percent of\nenrolled students are white; the remaining 59 percent,\ncomprising all other racial groups, are classified by Seattle\nfor assignment purposes as nonwhite. Id., at 38a, 103a.2\nIf an oversubscribed school is not within 10 percentage\npoints of the district’s overall white/nonwhite racial bal\nance, it is what the district calls “integration positive,” and\nthe district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assign\nment students whose race “will serve to bring the school\ninto balance.” Id., at 38a. See Parents Involved VII, 426\nF. 3d 1162, 1169–1170 (CA9 2005) (en banc).3 If it is still\nnecessary to select students for the school after using the\nracial tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is the geographic\nproximity of the school to the student’s residence. App. in\nNo. 05–908, at 38a.\n   Seattle has never operated segregated schools—legally\n——————\nyear in evaluating the plan. See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1169–1171 (CA9 2005)\n(en banc) (Parents Involved VII).\n  2 The racial breakdown of this nonwhite group is approximately 23.8\n\npercent Asian-American, 23.1 percent African-American, 10.3 percent\nLatino, and 2.8 percent Native-American. See 377 F. 3d 949, 1005–\n1006 (CA9 2004) (Parents Involved VI) (Graber, J., dissenting).\n  3 For the 2001–2002 school year, the deviation permitted from the\n\ndesired racial composition was increased from 10 to 15 percent.

Most white students live in the\nnorthern part of Seattle, most students of other racial\nbackgrounds in the southern part. Parents Involved VII,\nsupra, at 1166. Four of Seattle’s high schools are located\nin the north—Ballard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Roo\nsevelt—and five in the south—Rainier Beach, Cleveland,\nWest Seattle, Chief Sealth, and Franklin. One school—\nGarfield—is more or less in the center of Seattle. App. in\nNo. 05–908, at 38a–39a, 45a.\n   For the 2000–2001 school year, five of these schools\nwere oversubscribed—Ballard, Nathan Hale, Roosevelt,\nGarfield, and Franklin—so much so that 82 percent of\nincoming ninth graders ranked one of these schools as\ntheir first choice. Id., at 38a. Three of the oversubscribed\nschools were “integration positive” because the school’s\nwhite enrollment the previous school year was greater\nthan 51 percent—Ballard, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt.\nThus, more nonwhite students (107, 27, and 82, respec\ntively) who selected one of these three schools as a top\nchoice received placement at the school than would have\nbeen the case had race not been considered, and proximity\nbeen the next tiebreaker. Id., at 39a–40a. Franklin was\n“integration positive” because its nonwhite enrollment the\nprevious school year was greater than 69 percent; 89 more\nwhite students were assigned to Franklin by operation of\nthe racial tiebreaker in the 2000–2001 school year than\notherwise would have been. Ibid. Garfield was the only\noversubscribed school whose composition during the 1999–\n2000 school year was within the racial guidelines, al\nthough in previous years Garfield’s enrollment had been\npredominantly nonwhite, and the racial tiebreaker had\nbeen used to give preference to white students.

In\n1973 a federal court found that Jefferson County had\nmaintained a segregated school system, Newburg Area\nCouncil, Inc. v. Board of Ed. of Jefferson Cty., 489 F. 2d\n925, 932 (CA6), vacated and remanded, 418 U. S. 918,\nreinstated with modifications, 510 F. 2d 1358, 1359 (CA6\n1974), and in 1975 the District Court entered a desegrega\ntion decree. See Hampton v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed., 72\nF. Supp. 2d 753, 762–764 (WD Ky. 1999). Jefferson\nCounty operated under this decree until 2000, when the\nDistrict Court dissolved the decree after finding that the\ndistrict had achieved unitary status by eliminating “[t]o\nthe greatest extent practicable” the vestiges of its prior\npolicy of segregation. Hampton v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of\nEd., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 360 (2000). See Board of Ed. of\nOklahoma City Public Schools v. Dowell, 498 U. S. 237,\n249–250 (1991); Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391\nU. S. 430, 435–436 (1968).\n   In 2001, after the decree had been dissolved, Jefferson\nCounty adopted the voluntary student assignment plan at\nissue in this case. App. in No. 05–915, p. 77. Approxi\nmately 34 percent of the district’s 97,000 students are\nblack; most of the remaining 66 percent are white.\nMcFarland v. Jefferson Cty. Public Schools, 330 F.

The district assigns students to nonmagnet\nschools in one of two ways: Parents of kindergartners,\nfirst-graders, and students new to the district may submit\nan application indicating a first and second choice among\nthe schools within their cluster; students who do not sub\nmit such an application are assigned within the cluster by\nthe district. “Decisions to assign students to schools\nwithin each cluster are based on available space within\nthe schools and the racial guidelines in the District’s\ncurrent student assignment plan.” Id., at 38. If a school\nhas reached the “extremes of the racial guidelines,” a\nstudent whose race would contribute to the school’s racial\nimbalance will not be assigned there. Id., at 38–39, 82.\nAfter assignment, students at all grade levels are permit\nted to apply to transfer between nonmagnet schools in the\ndistrict. Transfers may be requested for any number of\nreasons, and may be denied because of lack of available\nspace or on the basis of the racial guidelines. Id., at 43.7\n   When petitioner Crystal Meredith moved into the school\ndistrict in August 2002, she sought to enroll her son,\nJoshua McDonald, in kindergarten for the 2002–2003\nschool year. His resides school was only a mile from his\nnew home, but it had no available space—assignments\nhad been made in May, and the class was full. Jefferson\nCounty assigned Joshua to another elementary school in\nhis cluster, Young Elementary. This school was 10 miles\nfrom home, and Meredith sought to transfer Joshua to a\nschool in a different cluster, Bloom Elementary, which—\n——————\n  7 Middle and high school students are designated a single resides\n\nschool and assigned to that school unless it is at the extremes of the\nracial guidelines.

See\nTr. in McFarland I, pp. 1–49 through 1–54 (Dec. 8, 2003).\nSpace was available at Bloom, and intercluster transfers\nare allowed, but Joshua’s transfer was nonetheless denied\nbecause, in the words of Jefferson County, “[t]he transfer\nwould have an adverse effect on desegregation compli\nance” of Young. App. in No. 05–915, at 97.8\n   Meredith brought suit in the Western District of Ken\ntucky, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.

The other plaintiffs all challenged assignments to\ncertain specialized schools, and the District Court found these assign\nments, which are no longer at issue in this case, unconstitutional.\nMcFarland I, 330 F.

The group’s members\nhave children in the district’s elementary, middle, and\nhigh schools, App. in No. 05–908, at 299a–301a; Affidavit\nof Kathleen Brose Pursuant to this Court’s Rule 32.3\n(Lodging of Petitioner Parents Involved), and the com\nplaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of\nParents Involved members whose elementary and middle\nschool children may be “denied admission to the high\nschools of their choice when they apply for those schools in\nthe future,” App. in No. 05–908, at 30a. The fact that it is\npossible that children of group members will not be denied\nadmission to a school based on their race—because they\nchoose an undersubscribed school or an oversubscribed\nschool in which their race is an advantage—does not\neliminate the injury claimed. Moreover, Parents Involved\nalso asserted an interest in not being “forced to compete\nfor seats at certain high schools in a system that uses race\nas a deciding factor in many of its admissions decisions.”\nIbid. As we have held, one form of injury under the Equal\nProtection Clause is being forced to compete in a race-\nbased system that may prejudice the plaintiff, Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v.

Although apparently Joshua\nhas now been granted a transfer to Bloom, the school to\nwhich transfer was denied under the racial guidelines, Tr.\nof Oral Arg. in No. 05–915, at 45, the racial guidelines\napply at all grade levels. Upon Joshua’s enrollment in\nmiddle school, he may again be subject to assignment\nbased on his race.

Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 537\n(1980) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); brackets omitted). In\norder to satisfy this searching standard of review, the\nschool districts must demonstrate that the use of individ\nual racial classifications in the assignment plans here\nunder review is “narrowly tailored” to achieve a “compel\nling” government interest. Adarand, supra, at 227.\n   Without attempting in these cases to set forth all the\ninterests a school district might assert, it suffices to note\nthat our prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classi\nfications in the school context, have recognized two inter\nests that qualify as compelling. The first is the compelling\ninterest of remedying the effects of past intentional dis\ncrimination. See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494\n(1992). Yet the Seattle public schools have not shown that\nthey were ever segregated by law, and were not subject to\ncourt-ordered desegregation decrees.         The Jefferson\nCounty public schools were previously segregated by law\nand were subject to a desegregation decree entered in\n1975. In 2000, the District Court that entered that decree\ndissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had “eliminated\nthe vestiges associated with the former policy of segrega\ntion and its pernicious effects,” and thus had achieved\n“unitary” status. Hampton, 102 F. Supp. 2d, at 360.\nJefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an inter\nest in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimina\ntion in defending its present use of race in assigning stu\ndents. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05–915, at 38.\n   Nor could it. We have emphasized that the harm being\nremedied by mandatory desegregation plans is the harm\nthat is traceable to segregation, and that “the Constitution\nis not violated by racial imbalance in the schools, without\nmore.” Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 280, n. 14\n(1977). See also Freeman, supra, at 495–496; Dowell, 498\nU. S., at 248; Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717, 746\n(1974). Once Jefferson County achieved unitary status, it\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

Any continued use of race must be\njustified on some other basis.10\n   The second government interest we have recognized as\ncompelling for purposes of strict scrutiny is the interest in\ndiversity in higher education upheld in Grutter, 539 U. S.,\nat 328. The specific interest found compelling in Grutter\nwas student body diversity “in the context of higher educa\ntion.” Ibid. The diversity interest was not focused on race\nalone but encompassed “all factors that may contribute to\nstudent body diversity.” Id., at 337. We described the\nvarious types of diversity that the law school sought:\n     “[The law school’s] policy makes clear there are many\n     possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides\n     examples of admittees who have lived or traveled\n     widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have\n\n——————\n  10 The districts point to dicta in a prior opinion in which the Court\n\nsuggested that, while not constitutionally mandated, it would be\nconstitutionally permissible for a school district to seek racially bal\nanced schools as a matter of “educational policy.” See Swann v. Char\nlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971). The districts also\nquote with approval an in-chambers opinion in which then-Justice\nRehnquist made a suggestion to the same effect. See Bustop, Inc. v. Los\nAngeles Bd. of Ed., 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978). The citations do not\ncarry the significance the districts would ascribe to them. Swann,\nevaluating a school district engaged in court-ordered desegregation,\nhad no occasion to consider whether a district’s voluntary adoption of\nrace-based assignments in the absence of a finding of prior de jure\nsegregation was constitutionally permissible, an issue that was again\nexpressly reserved in Washington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458\nU. S. 457, 472, n. 15 (1982). Bustop, addressing in the context of an\nemergency injunction application a busing plan imposed by the Supe\nrior Court of Los Angeles County, is similarly unavailing. Then-Justice\nRehnquist, in denying emergency relief, stressed that “equitable\nconsideration[s]” counseled against preliminary relief. 439 U. S., at\n1383.

Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978), noting that “it is not an\ninterest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified\npercentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to\nbe members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the\nuse of race.” Grutter, supra, at 324–325 (citing and quot\ning Bakke, supra, at 314–315 (opinion of Powell, J.);\nbrackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead,\nwhat was upheld in Grutter was consideration of “a far\nbroader array of qualifications and characteristics of\nwhich racial or ethnic origin is but a single though impor\ntant element.” 539 U. S., at 325 (quoting Bakke, supra,\nat 315 (opinion of Powell, J.); internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n  The entire gist of the analysis in Grutter was that the\nadmissions program at issue there focused on each appli\ncant as an individual, and not simply as a member of a\nparticular racial group. The classification of applicants by\nrace upheld in Grutter was only as part of a “highly indi\nvidualized, holistic review,” 539 U. S., at 337. As the\nCourt explained, “[t]he importance of this individualized\nconsideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions\nprogram is paramount.” Ibid. The point of the narrow\ntailoring analysis in which the Grutter Court engaged was\nto ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed\npart of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply\nan effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court ex\nplained would be “patently unconstitutional.” Id., at 330.\n  In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

It is not simply one factor weighed with\nothers in reaching a decision, as in Grutter; it is the factor.\nLike the University of Michigan undergraduate plan\nstruck down in Gratz, 539 U. S., at 275, the plans here “do\nnot provide for a meaningful individualized review of\napplicants” but instead rely on racial classifications in a\n“nonindividualized, mechanical” way. Id., at 276, 280\n(O’Connor, J., concurring).\n  Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only\na limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in\nwhite/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/“other” terms\nin Jefferson County.11 But see Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.\nFCC, 497 U. S. 547, 610 (1990) (“We are a Nation not of\nblack and white alone, but one teeming with divergent\ncommunities knitted together with various traditions and\ncarried forth, above all, by individuals”) (O’Connor, J.,\ndissenting). The Seattle “Board Statement Reaffirming\nDiversity Rationale” speaks of the “inherent educational\nvalue” in “[p]roviding students the opportunity to attend\nschools with diverse student enrollment,” App. in No. 05–\n908, at 128a, 129a. But under the Seattle plan, a school\nwith 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent\nwhite students but no African-American, Native-\nAmerican, or Latino students would qualify as balanced,\n——————\n  11 The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out. Upon enroll\n\ning their child with the district, parents are required to identify their\nchild as a member of a particular racial group. If a parent identifies\nmore than one race on the form, “[t]he application will not be accepted\nand, if necessary, the enrollment service person taking the application\nwill indicate one box.” App. in No. 05–908, at 303a.\n\f16    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

It is hard to understand how a\nplan that could allow these results can be viewed as being\nconcerned with achieving enrollment that is “ ‘broadly\ndiverse,’ ” Grutter, supra, at 329.\n   Prior to Grutter, the courts of appeals rejected as uncon\nstitutional attempts to implement race-based assignment\nplans—such as the plans at issue here—in primary and\nsecondary schools. See, e.g., Eisenberg v. Montgomery Cty.\nPublic Schools, 197 F. 3d 123, 133 (CA4 1999); Tuttle v.\nArlington Cty. School Bd., 195 F. 3d 698, 701 (CA4 1999);\nWessman v. Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790, 809 (CA1 1998). See\nalso Ho v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 147 F. 3d\n854, 865 (CA9 1998). After Grutter, however, the two\nCourts of Appeals in these cases, and one other, found that\nrace-based assignments were permissible at the elemen\ntary and secondary level, largely in reliance on that case.\nSee Parents Involved VII, 426 F. 3d, at 1166; McFarland\nII, 416 F. 3d, at 514; Comfort v. Lynn School Comm., 418\nF. 3d 1, 13 (CA1 2005).\n   In upholding the admissions plan in Grutter, though,\nthis Court relied upon considerations unique to institu\ntions of higher education, noting that in light of “the ex\npansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with\nthe university environment, universities occupy a special\nniche in our constitutional tradition.” 539 U. S., at 329.\nSee also Bakke, supra, at 312, 313 (opinion of Powell, J.).\nThe Court explained that “[c]ontext matters” in applying\nstrict scrutiny, and repeatedly noted that it was address\ning the use of race “in the context of higher education.”\nGrutter, supra, at 327, 328, 334. The Court in Grutter\nexpressly articulated key limitations on its holding—\ndefining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting\nthe unique context of higher education—but these limita\ntions were largely disregarded by the lower courts in\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

The present cases are\nnot governed by Grutter.\n                              B\n   Perhaps recognizing that reliance on Grutter cannot\nsustain their plans, both school districts assert additional\ninterests, distinct from the interest upheld in Grutter, to\njustify their race-based assignments. In briefing and\nargument before this Court, Seattle contends that its use\nof race helps to reduce racial concentration in schools and\nto ensure that racially concentrated housing patterns do\nnot prevent nonwhite students from having access to the\nmost desirable schools. Brief for Respondents in No. 05–\n908, at 19. Jefferson County has articulated a similar\ngoal, phrasing its interest in terms of educating its stu\ndents “in a racially integrated environment.” App. in No.\n05–915, at 22.12 Each school district argues that educa\ntional and broader socialization benefits flow from a ra\ncially diverse learning environment, and each contends\nthat because the diversity they seek is racial diversity—\nnot the broader diversity at issue in Grutter—it makes\nsense to promote that interest directly by relying on race\nalone.\n   The parties and their amici dispute whether racial\ndiversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test\nscores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangi\nble socialization benefits. The debate is not one we need to\n——————\n   12 Jefferson County also argues that it would be incongruous to hold\n\nthat what was constitutionally required of it one day—race-based\nassignments pursuant to the desegregation decree—can be constitu\ntionally prohibited the next. But what was constitutionally required of\nthe district prior to 2000 was the elimination of the vestiges of prior\nsegregation—not racial proportionality in its own right. See Freeman\nv. Pitts, 503 U. S. 467, 494–496 (1992). Once those vestiges were\neliminated, Jefferson County was on the same footing as any other\nschool district, and its use of race must be justified on other grounds.\n\f18    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                 Opinion of ofOBERTS, C. J. \n\n                  Opinion R the Court\n\nresolve, however, because it is clear that the racial classi\nfications employed by the districts are not narrowly tai\nlored to the goal of achieving the educational and social\nbenefits asserted to flow from racial diversity. In design\nand operation, the plans are directed only to racial bal\nance, pure and simple, an objective this Court has repeat\nedly condemned as illegitimate.\n   The plans are tied to each district’s specific racial demo\ngraphics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level\nof diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational\nbenefits. In Seattle, the district seeks white enrollment of\nbetween 31 and 51 percent (within 10 percent of “the\ndistrict white average” of 41 percent), and nonwhite en\nrollment of between 49 and 69 percent (within 10 percent\nof “the district minority average” of 59 percent). App. in\nNo. 05–908, at 103a. In Jefferson County, by contrast, the\ndistrict seeks black enrollment of no less than 15 or more\nthan 50 percent, a range designed to be “equally above and\nbelow      Black     student    enrollment       systemwide,”\nMcFarland I, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 842, based on the objec\ntive of achieving at “all schools . . . an African-American\nenrollment equivalent to the average district-wide Afri\ncan-American enrollment” of 34 percent. App. in No. 05–\n915, at 81. In Seattle, then, the benefits of racial diversity\nrequire enrollment of at least 31 percent white students;\nin Jefferson County, at least 50 percent. There must be at\nleast 15 percent nonwhite students under Jefferson\nCounty’s plan; in Seattle, more than three times that\nfigure. This comparison makes clear that the racial demo\ngraphics in each district—whatever they happen to be—\ndrive the required “diversity” numbers. The plans here\nare not tailored to achieving a degree of diversity neces\nsary to realize the asserted educational benefits; instead\nthe plans are tailored, in the words of Seattle’s Manager of\nEnrollment Planning, Technical Support, and Demograph\nics, to “the goal established by the school board of attain\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

The district did not attempt to defend the propo\nsition that anything outside its range posed the “specter of\nexceptionality.” Nor did it demonstrate in any way how\nthe educational and social benefits of racial diversity or\navoidance of racial isolation are more likely to be achieved\nat a school that is 50 percent white and 50 percent Asian-\nAmerican, which would qualify as diverse under Seattle’s\nplan, than at a school that is 30 percent Asian-American,\n25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20\npercent white, which under Seattle’s definition would be\nracially concentrated.\n   Similarly, Jefferson County’s expert referred to the\nimportance of having “at least 20 percent” minority group\nrepresentation for the group “to be visible enough to make\na difference,” and noted that “small isolated minority\ngroups in a school are not likely to have a strong effect on\nthe overall school.” App. in No. 05–915, at 159, 147.

J. \n\n                    Opinion R the Court\n\nJefferson County plan, however, is based on a goal of\nreplicating at each school “an African-American enroll\nment equivalent to the average district-wide African-\nAmerican enrollment.” Id., at 81. Joshua McDonald’s\nrequested transfer was denied because his race was listed\nas “other” rather than black, and allowing the transfer\nwould have had an adverse effect on the racial guideline\ncompliance of Young Elementary, the school he sought to\nleave. Id., at 21. At the time, however, Young Elementary\nwas 46.8 percent black. Id., at 73. The transfer might\nhave had an adverse effect on the effort to approach dis\ntrict-wide racial proportionality at Young, but it had noth\ning to do with preventing either the black or “other” group\nfrom becoming “small” or “isolated” at Young.\n   In fact, in each case the extreme measure of relying on\nrace in assignments is unnecessary to achieve the stated\ngoals, even as defined by the districts. For example, at\nFranklin High School in Seattle, the racial tiebreaker was\napplied because nonwhite enrollment exceeded 69 percent,\nand resulted in an incoming ninth-grade class in 2000–\n2001 that was 30.3 percent Asian-American, 21.9 percent\nAfrican-American, 6.8 percent Latino, 0.5 percent Native-\nAmerican, and 40.5 percent Caucasian. Without the racial\ntiebreaker, the class would have been 39.6 percent Asian-\nAmerican, 30.2 percent African-American, 8.3 percent\nLatino, 1.1 percent Native-American, and 20.8 percent\nCaucasian. See App. in No. 05–908, at 308a. When the\nactual racial breakdown is considered, enrolling students\nwithout regard to their race yields a substantially diverse\nstudent body under any definition of diversity.13\n——————\n   13 Data for the Seattle schools in the several years since this litigation\n\nwas commenced further demonstrate the minimal role that the racial\ntiebreaker in fact played. At Ballard, in 2005–2006—when no class at\nthe school was subject to the racial tiebreaker—the student body was\n14.2 percent Asian-American, 9 percent African-American, 11.7 percent\nLatino, 62.3 percent Caucasian, and 2.8 percent Native-American.\n\f                    Cite as: 551 U.

J., dissenting); id., at 388–392\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting), the majority concluded that the\nlaw school did not count back from its applicant pool to\narrive at the “meaningful number” it regarded as neces\nsary to diversify its student body. Id., at 335–336. Here\nthe racial balance the districts seek is a defined range set\nsolely by reference to the demographics of the respective\nschool districts.\n   This working backward to achieve a particular type of\nracial balance, rather than working forward from some\ndemonstration of the level of diversity that provides the\npurported benefits, is a fatal flaw under our existing\nprecedent.

Parents Involved VII, 426 F. 3d, at\n1192. But in Seattle the plans are defended as necessary\nto address the consequences of racially identifiable hous\ning patterns. The sweep of the mandate claimed by the\ndistrict is contrary to our rulings that remedying past\nsocietal discrimination does not justify race-conscious\ngovernment action. See, e.g., Shaw v.

Racial balancing is not\ntransformed from “patently unconstitutional” to a compel\nling state interest simply by relabeling it “racial diversity.”\nWhile the school districts use various verbal formulations\nto describe the interest they seek to promote—racial di\nversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration—\nthey offer no definition of the interest that suggests it\ndiffers from racial balance.

For the\nforegoing reasons, this conclusory argument cannot sus\ntain the plans.

To the extent the objective is sufficient\ndiversity so that students see fellow students as individu\nals rather than solely as members of a racial group, using\nmeans that treat students solely as members of a racial\ngroup is fundamentally at cross-purposes with that end.\n                               C\n   The districts assert, as they must, that the way in which\nthey have employed individual racial classifications is\nnecessary to achieve their stated ends. The minimal effect\nthese classifications have on student assignments, how\never, suggests that other means would be effective. Seat\ntle’s racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a\nsmall number of students between schools. Approximately\n307 student assignments were affected by the racial tie\nbreaker in 2000–2001; the district was able to track the\nenrollment status of 293 of these students. App. in No.\n05–908, at 162a. Of these, 209 were assigned to a school\nthat was one of their choices, 87 of whom were assigned to\nthe same school to which they would have been assigned\nwithout the racial tiebreaker. Eighty-four students were\nassigned to schools that they did not list as a choice, but\n29 of those students would have been assigned to their\nrespective school without the racial tiebreaker, and 3 were\n\f26     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

In\nover one-third of the assignments affected by the racial\ntiebreaker, then, the use of race in the end made no differ\nence, and the district could identify only 52 students who\nwere ultimately affected adversely by the racial tiebreaker\nin that it resulted in assignment to a school they had not\nlisted as a preference and to which they would not other\nwise have been assigned.\n   As the panel majority in Parents Involved VI concluded:\n     “[T]he tiebreaker’s annual effect is thus merely to\n     shuffle a few handfuls of different minority students\n     between a few schools—about a dozen additional La\n     tinos into Ballard, a dozen black students into Nathan\n     Hale, perhaps two dozen Asians into Roosevelt, and so\n     on. The District has not met its burden of proving\n     these marginal changes . . . outweigh the cost of sub\n     jecting hundreds of students to disparate treatment\n     based solely upon the color of their skin.” 377 F. 3d,\n     at 984–985 (footnote omitted).\n   Similarly, Jefferson County’s use of racial classifications\nhas only a minimal effect on the assignment of students.\nElementary school students are assigned to their first- or\nsecond-choice school 95 percent of the time, and transfers,\nwhich account for roughly 5 percent of assignments, are\nonly denied 35 percent of the time—and presumably an\neven smaller percentage are denied on the basis of the\nracial guidelines, given that other factors may lead to a\ndenial. McFarland I, 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 844–845, nn. 16,\n18. Jefferson County estimates that the racial guidelines\naccount for only 3 percent of assignments. Brief in Oppo\nsition in No. 05–915, p. 7, n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05–\n915, at 46. As Jefferson County explains, “the racial\nguidelines have minimal impact in this process, because\nthey ‘mostly influence student assignment in subtle and\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          27\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nindirect ways.’ ” Brief for Respondents in No. 05–915,\npp. 8–9.\n    While we do not suggest that greater use of race would\nbe preferable, the minimal impact of the districts’ racial\nclassifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the\nnecessity of using racial classifications. In Grutter, the\nconsideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more\nthan tripling minority representation at the law school—\nfrom 4 to 14.5 percent. See 539 U. S., at 320. Here the\nmost Jefferson County itself claims is that “because the\nguidelines provide a firm definition of the Board’s goal of\nracially integrated schools, they ‘provide administrators\nwith the authority to facilitate, negotiate and collaborate\nwith principals and staff to maintain schools within the\n15–50% range.’ ” Brief in Opposition in No. 05–915, at 7\n(quoting McFarland I, supra, at 842). Classifying and\nassigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception\nof race is an extreme approach in light of our precedents\nand our Nation’s history of using race in public schools,\nand requires more than such an amorphous end to justify\nit.\n    The districts have also failed to show that they consid\nered methods other than explicit racial classifications to\nachieve their stated goals. Narrow tailoring requires\n“serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral\nalternatives,” Grutter, supra, at 339, and yet in Seattle\nseveral alternative assignment plans—many of which\nwould not have used express racial classifications—were\nrejected with little or no consideration. See, e.g., App. in\nNo. 05–908, at 224a–225a, 253a–259a, 307a. Jefferson\nCounty has failed to present any evidence that it consid\nered alternatives, even though the district already claims\nthat its goals are achieved primarily through means other\nthan the racial classifications.

Instead, it selectively relies on inapplicable\nprecedent and even dicta while dismissing contrary hold\nings, alters and misapplies our well-established legal\nframework for assessing equal protection challenges to\nexpress racial classifications, and greatly exaggerates the\nconsequences of today’s decision.\n   To begin with, JUSTICE BREYER seeks to justify the\nplans at issue under our precedents recognizing the com\npelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimina\ntion. See post, at 18–24. Not even the school districts go\nthis far, and for good reason. The distinction between\nsegregation by state action and racial imbalance caused by\nother factors has been central to our jurisprudence in this\narea for generations. See, e.g., Milliken, 433 U. S., at 280,\nn. 14; Freeman, 503 U. S., at 495–496 (“Where resegrega\ntion is a product not of state action but of private choices,\nit does not have constitutional implications”). The dissent\nelides this distinction between de jure and de facto segre\ngation, casually intimates that Seattle’s school attendance\npatterns reflect illegal segregation, post, at 5, 18, 23,15 and\n——————\n  15 JUSTICE BREYER makes much of the fact that in 1978 Seattle “set\ntled” an NAACP complaint alleging illegal segregation with the federal\nOffice for Civil Rights (OCR). See post, at 5, 8–9, 18, 23. The memo\nrandum of agreement between Seattle and OCR, of course, contains no\nadmission by Seattle that such segregation ever existed or was ongoing\nat the time of the agreement, and simply reflects a “desire to avoid the\nincovenience [sic] and expense of a formal OCR investigation,” which\nOCR was obligated under law to initiate upon the filing of such a\ncomplaint.

The dissent thus alters\nin fundamental ways not only the facts presented here but\nthe established law.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s reliance on McDaniel v. Barresi, 402\nU. S. 39 (1971), post, at 23–24, 29–30, highlights how far\nremoved the discussion in the dissent is from the question\nactually presented in these cases. McDaniel concerned a\nGeorgia school system that had been segregated by law.\nThere was no doubt that the county had operated a “dual\nschool system,” McDaniel, supra, at 41, and no one ques\ntions that the obligation to disestablish a school system\nsegregated by law can include race-conscious remedies—\nwhether or not a court had issued an order to that effect.\nSee supra, at 12. The present cases are before us, how\never, because the Seattle school district was never segre\ngated by law, and the Jefferson County district has been\nfound to be unitary, having eliminated the vestiges of its\nprior dual status. The justification for race-conscious\nremedies in McDaniel is therefore not applicable here.\nThe dissent’s persistent refusal to accept this distinction—\nits insistence on viewing the racial classifications here as\nif they were just like the ones in McDaniel, “devised to\novercome a history of segregated public schools,” post, at\n47—explains its inability to understand why the remedial\njustification for racial classifications cannot decide these\ncases.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent next relies heavily on dicta\nfrom Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402\nU. S., at 16—far more heavily than the school districts\nthemselves. Compare post, at 3, 22–28, with Brief for\nRespondents in No. 05–908, at 19–20; Brief for Respon\ndents in No. 05–915, at 31.

J. \n\n                  Opinion R the Court\n\nthe two-sentence discussion in Swann was pure dicta,\npost, at 22, but nonetheless asserts that it demonstrates a\n“basic principle of constitutional law” that provides “au\nthoritative legal guidance.” Post, at 22, 30. Initially, as\nthe Court explained just last Term, “we are not bound to\nfollow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at\nissue was not fully debated.” Central Va. Community\nCollege v. Katz, 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006). That is particu\nlarly true given that, when Swann was decided, this Court\nhad not yet confirmed that strict scrutiny applies to racial\nclassifications like those before us. See n. 16, infra. There\nis nothing “technical” or “theoretical,” post, at 30, about\nour approach to such dicta. See, e.g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6\nWheat. 264, 399–400 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (explaining\nwhy dicta is not binding).\n   JUSTICE BREYER would not only put such extraordinary\nweight on admitted dicta, but relies on the statement for\nsomething it does not remotely say. Swann addresses only\na possible state objective; it says nothing of the permissi\nble means—race conscious or otherwise—that a school\ndistrict might employ to achieve that objective. The rea\nson for this omission is clear enough, since the case did not\ninvolve any voluntary means adopted by a school district.\nThe dissent’s characterization of Swann as recognizing\nthat “the Equal Protection Clause permits local school\nboards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive\nrace-related goals” is—at best—a dubious inference. Post,\nat 22. Even if the dicta from Swann were entitled to the\nweight the dissent would give it, and no dicta is, it not\nonly did not address the question presented in Swann, it\nalso does not address the question presented in these\ncases—whether the school districts’ use of racial classifica\ntions to achieve their stated goals is permissible.\n   Further, for all the lower court cases JUSTICE BREYER\ncites as evidence of the “prevailing legal assumption”\nembodied by Swann, very few are pertinent. Most are not.\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                    31\n\n                        Opinion of ofOBERTS, C.

But\nTometz addressed a challenge to a statute requiring race-\nconsciousness in drawing school attendance boundaries—\nan issue well beyond the scope of the question presented in\nthese cases. Importantly, it considered that issue only\nunder rational-basis review, 39 Ill. 2d, at 600, 237 N. E.\n2d, at 502 (“The test of any legislative classification essen\ntially is one of reasonableness”), which even the dissent\ngrudgingly recognizes is an improper standard for evaluat\ning express racial classifications. Other cases cited are\nsimilarly inapplicable. See, e.g., Citizens for Better Ed. v.\nGoose Creek Consol. Independent School Dist., 719 S. W.\n2d 350, 352–353 (Tex. App. 1986) (upholding rezoning\nplan under rational-basis review).16\n——————\n  16 In fact, all the cases JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent cites as evidence of\nthe “prevailing legal assumption,” see post, at 25–27, were decided\nbefore this Court definitively determined that “all racial classifications\n. . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.”\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995). Many\nproceeded under the now-rejected view that classifications seeking to\nbenefit a disadvantaged racial group should be held to a lesser stan\ndard of review. See, e.g., Springfield School Comm. v. Barksdale, 348\nF. 2d 261, 266 (CA1 1965). Even if this purported distinction, which\nJUSTICE STEVENS would adopt, post, at 2, n. 3 (dissenting opinion), had\nnot been already rejected by this Court, the distinction has no relevance\nto these cases, in which students of all races are excluded from the\nschools they wish to attend based solely on the racial classifications.\nSee, e.g., App. in No. 05–908, at 202a (noting that 89 nonwhite students\nwere denied assignment to a particular school by operation of Seattle’s\nracial tiebreaker).\n    JUSTICE STEVENS’s reliance on School Comm. of Boston v.

Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458\nU. S. 457, 472, n. 15 (1982), post, at 56–57, but there this\nCourt expressly noted that it was not passing on the pro\npriety of race-conscious student assignments in the ab\nsence of a finding of de jure segregation. Similarly, the\ncitation of Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458\nU. S. 527 (1982), post, at 24, in which a state referendum\nprohibiting a race-based assignment plan was challenged,\nis inapposite—in Crawford the Court again expressly\nreserved the question presented by these cases. 458 U. S.,\nat 535, n. 11. Such reservations and preliminary analyses\nof course did not decide the merits of this question—as\nevidenced by the disagreement among the lower courts on\nthis issue. Compare Eisenberg, 197 F. 3d, at 133, with\nComfort, 418 F. 3d, at 13.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent also asserts that these cases\nare controlled by Grutter, claiming that the existence of a\ncompelling interest in these cases “follows a fortiori” from\nGrutter, post, at 41, 64–66, and accusing us of tacitly\n——————\nracial imbalance in schools but did not specify how to achieve this\ngoal—and certainly did not require express racial classifications as the\nmeans to do so. The law was upheld under rational-basis review, with\nthe state court explicitly rejecting the suggestion—which is now plainly\nthe law—that “racial group classifications bear a far heavier burden of\njustification.” 352 Mass., at 700, 227 N. E. 2d, at 734 (internal quota\ntion marks and citation omitted). The passage JUSTICE STEVENS quotes\nproves our point; all the quoted language says is that the school com\nmittee “shall prepare a plan to eliminate the imbalance.” Id., at 695,\n227 N. E. 2d, at 731; see post, at 4, n. 5. Nothing in the opinion ap\nproves use of racial classifications as the means to address the imbal\nance. The suggestion that our decision today is somehow inconsistent\nwith our disposition of that appeal is belied by the fact that neither the\nlower courts, the respondent school districts, nor any of their 51 amici\nsaw fit even to cite the case. We raise this fact not to argue that the\ndismissal should be afforded any different stare decisis effect, but\nrather simply to suggest that perhaps—for the reasons noted above—\nthe dismissal does not mean what JUSTICE STEVENS believes it does.\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

The dissent over-\nreads Grutter, however, in suggesting that it renders pure\nracial balancing a constitutionally compelling interest;\nGrutter itself recognized that using race simply to achieve\nracial balance would be “patently unconstitutional,” 539\nU. S., at 330. The Court was exceedingly careful in de\nscribing the interest furthered in Grutter as “not an inter\nest in simple ethnic diversity” but rather a “far broader\narray of qualifications and characteristics” in which race\nwas but a single element. 539 U. S., at 324–325 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We take the Grutter Court at\nits word. We simply do not understand how JUSTICE\nBREYER can maintain that classifying every schoolchild as\nblack or white, and using that classification as a determi\nnative factor in assigning children to achieve pure racial\nbalance, can be regarded as “less burdensome, and hence\nmore narrowly tailored” than the consideration of race in\nGrutter, post, at 47, when the Court in Grutter stated that\n“[t]he importance of . . . individualized consideration” in\nthe program was “paramount,” and consideration of race\nwas one factor in a “highly individualized, holistic review.”\n539 U. S., at 337. Certainly if the constitutionality of the\nstark use of race in these cases were as established as the\ndissent would have it, there would have been no need for\nthe extensive analysis undertaken in Grutter. In light of\nthe foregoing, JUSTICE BREYER’s appeal to stare decisis\nrings particularly hollow. See post, at 65–66.\n   At the same time it relies on inapplicable desegregation\ncases, misstatements of admitted dicta, and other noncon\ntrolling pronouncements, JUSTICE BREYER’s dissent can\ndidly dismisses the significance of this Court’s repeated\nholdings that all racial classifications must be reviewed\nunder strict scrutiny, see post, at 31–33, 35–36, arguing\nthat a different standard of review should be applied\nbecause the districts use race for beneficent rather than\nmalicious purposes, see post, at 31–36.\n\f34    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

JUSTICE BREYER nonethe\nless relies on the good intentions and motives of the school\ndistricts, stating that he has found “no case that . . . repu\ndiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which\nseeks to exclude and that which seeks to include members\nof minority races.” Post, at 29 (emphasis in original). We\nhave found many. Our cases clearly reject the argument\nthat motives affect the strict scrutiny analysis. See John\nson, supra, at 505 (“We have insisted on strict scrutiny in\nevery context, even for so-called ‘benign’ racial classifica\ntions”); Adarand, 515 U.

S., at 500 (“Racial classifica\ntions are suspect, and that means that simple legislative\nassurances of good intention cannot suffice”).\n   This argument that different rules should govern racial\nclassifications designed to include rather than exclude is\nnot new; it has been repeatedly pressed in the past, see,\ne.g., Gratz, 539 U.

History should teach greater humil\nity. . . . ‘[B]enign’ carries with it no independent meaning,\nbut reflects only acceptance of the current generation’s\nconclusion that a politically acceptable burden, imposed on\nparticular citizens on the basis of race, is reasonable.”\nMetro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 609–610 (O’Connor, J.,\ndissenting). See also Adarand, supra, at 226 (“ ‘[I]t may\nnot always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact\nbenign’ ” (quoting Bakke, supra, at 298 (opinion of Powell,\nJ.))). Accepting JUSTICE BREYER’s approach would “do no\nmore than move us from ‘separate but equal’ to ‘unequal\nbut benign.’ ” Metro Broadcasting, supra, at 638 (KEN\nNEDY, J., dissenting).\n   JUSTICE BREYER speaks of bringing “the races” together\n(putting aside the purely black-and-white nature of the\nplans), as the justification for excluding individuals on the\nbasis of their race. See post, at 28–29. Again, this ap\nproach to racial classifications is fundamentally at odds\nwith our precedent, which makes clear that the Equal\nProtection Clause “protect[s] persons, not groups,” Ada-\nrand, 515 U. S., at 227 (emphasis in original). See ibid.\n(“[A]ll governmental action based on race—a group classi\nfication long recognized as ‘in most circumstances irrele\nvant and therefore prohibited,’ Hirabayashi [v. United\nStates, 320 U.

S.\n294, 300 (1955) (Brown II) (“At stake is the personal inter\nest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools . . . on a\nnondiscriminatory basis” (emphasis added)). For the\ndissent, in contrast, “ ‘individualized scrutiny’ is simply\nbeside the point.” Post, at 55.\n   JUSTICE BREYER’s position comes down to a familiar\nclaim: The end justifies the means. He admits that “there\nis a cost in applying ‘a state-mandated racial label,’ ” post,\nat 67, but he is confident that the cost is worth paying.\nOur established strict scrutiny test for racial classifica\ntions, however, insists on “detailed examination, both as to\nends and as to means.” Adarand, supra, at 236 (emphasis\nadded). Simply because the school districts may seek a\nworthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on\nthe basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial classifi\ncations should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.\n   Despite his argument that these cases should be evalu\nated under a “standard of review that is not ‘strict’ in the\ntraditional sense of that word,” post, at 36, JUSTICE\nBREYER still purports to apply strict scrutiny to these\ncases. See post, at 37. It is evident, however, that\nJUSTICE BREYER’s brand of narrow tailoring is quite\nunlike anything found in our precedents. Without any\ndetailed discussion of the operation of the plans, the stu\ndents who are affected, or the districts’ failure to consider\nrace-neutral alternatives, the dissent concludes that the\ndistricts have shown that these racial classifications are\nnecessary to achieve the districts’ stated goals. This con\nclusion is divorced from any evaluation of the actual im\npact of the plans at issue in these cases—other than to\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

The Constitution and our\nprecedents require more.\n   In keeping with his view that strict scrutiny should not\napply, JUSTICE BREYER repeatedly urges deference to local\nschool boards on these issues. See, e.g., post, at 21, 48–49,\n66. Such deference “is fundamentally at odds with our\nequal protection jurisprudence. We put the burden on\nstate actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies\nare justified.” Johnson, 543 U. S., at 506, n. 1. See Cro\nson, 488 U.

This presumably refers to the\ndistrict’s decision to cease, for 2001–2002 school year assignments,\napplying the racial tiebreaker to students seeking to transfer to a\ndifferent school after ninth grade. See App. in No. 05–908, at 137a–\n139a. There are obvious disincentives for students to transfer to a\ndifferent school after a full quarter of their high school experience has\npassed, and the record sheds no light on how transfers to the oversub\nscribed high schools are handled.\n\f38    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Post, at 58–62.\nThese other means—e.g., where to construct new schools,\nhow to allocate resources among schools, and which aca\ndemic offerings to provide to attract students to certain\nschools—implicate different considerations than the ex\nplicit racial classifications at issue in these cases, and we\nexpress no opinion on their validity—not even in dicta.\nRather, we employ the familiar and well-established ana\nlytic approach of strict scrutiny to evaluate the plans at\nissue today, an approach that in no way warrants the\ndissent’s cataclysmic concerns. Under that approach, the\nschool districts have not carried their burden of showing\nthat the ends they seek justify the particular extreme\nmeans they have chosen—classifying individual students\non the basis of their race and discriminating among them\non that basis.\n                         *      *     *\n   If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the\nschool districts is unclear, even on the districts’ own\nterms, the costs are undeniable. “[D]istinctions between\ncitizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very\nnature odious to a free people whose institutions are\nfounded upon the doctrine of equality.” Adarand, 515\nU.

In Brown v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (Brown I), we\nheld that segregation deprived black children of equal\neducational opportunities regardless of whether school\nfacilities and other tangible factors were equal, because\ngovernment classification and separation on grounds of\nrace themselves denoted inferiority. Id., at 493–494. It\nwas not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of le\ngally separating children on the basis of race on which the\nCourt relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954. See\nid., at 494 (“ ‘The impact [of segregation] is greater when it\nhas the sanction of the law’ ”). The next Term, we accord\ningly stated that “full compliance” with Brown I required\nschool districts “to achieve a system of determining admis\nsion to the public schools on a nonracial basis.” Brown II,\n349 U.

As counsel who appeared be\nfore this Court for the plaintiffs in Brown put it: “We have\none fundamental contention which we will seek to develop\nin the course of this argument, and that contention is that\nno State has any authority under the equal-protection\nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a\nfactor in affording educational opportunities among its\ncitizens.” Tr. of Oral Arg. in Brown I, p. 7 (Robert L.\nCarter, Dec. 9, 1952). There is no ambiguity in that state\nment. And it was that position that prevailed in this\nCourt, which emphasized in its remedial opinion that\nwhat was “[a]t stake is the personal interest of the plain\ntiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable\non a nondiscriminatory basis,” and what was required was\n“determining admission to the public schools on a nonra\ncial basis.” Brown II, supra, at 300–301 (emphasis added).\nWhat do the racial classifications do in these cases, if not\ndetermine admission to a public school on a racial basis?\n   Before Brown, schoolchildren were told where they\ncould and could not go to school based on the color of their\nskin. The school districts in these cases have not carried\nthe heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow\nthis once again—even for very different reasons. For\nschools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as\nSeattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segrega\ntion, such as Jefferson County, the way “to achieve a\nsystem of determining admission to the public schools on a\nnonracial basis,” Brown II, 349 U.

Contrary to the dissent’s arguments, reseg\nregation is not occurring in Seattle or Louisville; these\nschool boards have no present interest in remedying past\nsegregation; and these race-based student-assignment\nprograms do not serve any compelling state interest.\nAccordingly, the plans are unconstitutional.

This approach is just as wrong\ntoday as it was a half-century ago. The Constitution and\nour cases require us to be much more demanding before\npermitting local school boards to make decisions based on\nrace.\n                              I\n   The dissent repeatedly claims that the school districts\nare threatened with resegregation and that they will\nsuccumb to that threat if these plans are declared uncon\nstitutional. It also argues that these plans can be justified\nas part of the school boards’ attempts to “eradicat[e] ear\nlier school segregation.” See, e.g., post, at 4. Contrary to\nthe dissent’s rhetoric, neither of these school districts is\nthreatened with resegregation, and neither is constitu\ntionally compelled or permitted to undertake race-based\nremediation. Racial imbalance is not segregation, and the\nmere incantation of terms like resegregation and remedia\ntion cannot make up the difference.\n                              A\n   Because this Court has authorized and required race-\nbased remedial measures to address de jure segregation, it\nis important to define segregation clearly and to distin\nguish it from racial imbalance. In the context of public\nschooling, segregation is the deliberate operation of a\nschool system to “carry out a governmental policy to sepa\nrate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.” Swann\nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 6 (1971);\nsee also Monroe v. Board of Comm’rs of Jackson, 391 U. S.\n450, 452 (1968). In Brown, this Court declared that segre\ngation was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Swann, supra, at\n6; see also Green v.

S. 483,]\nheld unconstitutional and a year later Brown II[, 349 U. S.\n294 (1955)] held must be abolished”).1\n   Racial imbalance is the failure of a school district’s\nindividual schools to match or approximate the demo\ngraphic makeup of the student population at large. Cf.\nWashington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457,\n460 (1982). Racial imbalance is not segregation.2 Al\nthough presently observed racial imbalance might result\nfrom past de jure segregation, racial imbalance can also\nresult from any number of innocent private decisions,\nincluding voluntary housing choices. See Swann, supra,\nat 25–26; Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 116 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). Because racial imbalance is not\ninevitably linked to unconstitutional segregation, it is not\nunconstitutional in and of itself. Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.\nBrinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 413 (1977); Dayton Bd. of Ed. v.\nBrinkman, 443 U. S. 526, 531, n. 5 (1979) (“Racial imbal\nance . . . is not per se a constitutional violation”); Freeman\nv. Pitts, 503 U.

S. 717, 740–741,\nand n. 19 (1974).\n——————\n   1 In this Court’s paradigmatic segregation cases, there was a local\n\nordinance, state statute, or state constitutional provision requiring\nracial separation. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners in Bolling v. Sharpe,\nO. T. 1952, No. 4, pp. 28–30 (cataloging state laws requiring separa\ntion of the races); id., at App. A (listing “Statutory and Consti\ntutional Provisions in the States Where Segregation in Education is\nInstitutionalized”).\n   2 The dissent refers repeatedly and reverently to “ ‘integration.’ ”\n\nHowever, outside of the context of remediation for past de jure segrega\ntion, “integration” is simply racial balancing. See post, at 37. There\nfore, the school districts’ attempts to further “integrate” are properly\nthought of as little more than attempts to achieve a particular racial\nbalance.\n\f4       PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                    THOMAS, J., concurring\n\n\n   Although there is arguably a danger of racial imbalance\nin schools in Seattle and Louisville, there is no danger of\nresegregation. No one contends that Seattle has estab\nlished or that Louisville has reestablished a dual school\nsystem that separates students on the basis of race. The\nstatistics cited in Appendix A to the dissent are not to the\ncontrary. See post, at 69–72. At most, those statistics\nshow a national trend toward classroom racial imbalance.\nHowever, racial imbalance without intentional state action\nto separate the races does not amount to segregation. To\nraise the specter of resegregation to defend these pro\ngrams is to ignore the meaning of the word and the nature\nof the cases before us.3\n                             B\n  Just as the school districts lack an interest in prevent\ning resegregation, they also have no present interest in\nremedying past segregation. The Constitution generally\nprohibits government race-based decisionmaking, but this\nCourt has authorized the use of race-based measures for\nremedial purposes in two narrowly defined circumstances.\n——————\n   3 The dissent’s assertion that these plans are necessary for the school\n\ndistricts to maintain their “hard-won gains” reveals its conflation of\nsegregation and racial imbalance. Post, at 38. For the dissent’s pur\nposes, the relevant hard-won gains are the present racial compositions\nin the individual schools in Seattle and Louisville. However, the actual\nhard-won gain in these cases is the elimination of the vestiges of the\nsystem of state-enforced racial separation that once existed in Louis\nville. To equate the achievement of a certain statistical mix in several\nschools with the elimination of the system of systematic de jure segre\ngation trivializes the latter accomplishment. Nothing but an interest in\nclassroom aesthetics and a hypersensitivity to elite sensibilities justi\nfies the school districts’ racial balancing programs. See Part II–B,\ninfra. But “the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses\nour Constitution” required the disestablishment of de jure segregation.\nSee Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Assessed\nin any objective manner, there is no comparison between the two.\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

Second, in\nCroson, the Court appeared willing to authorize a govern\nment unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was\nresponsible. Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469,\n504 (1989). Without explicitly resting on either of these\nstrands of doctrine, the dissent repeatedly invokes the\nschool districts’ supposed interests in remedying past\nsegregation. Properly analyzed, though, these plans do\nnot fall within either existing category of permissible race-\nbased remediation.\n                              1\n   The Constitution does not permit race-based govern\nment decisionmaking simply because a school district\nclaims a remedial purpose and proceeds in good faith with\narguably pure motives. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S.\n306, 371 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dis\nsenting in part) (citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña,\n515 U. S. 200, 239 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment)). Rather, race-based gov\nernment decisionmaking is categorically prohibited unless\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. Grutter,\nsupra, at 326; see also Part II–A, infra. This exacting\nscrutiny “has proven automatically fatal” in most cases.\nJenkins, supra, at 121 (THOMAS, J., concurring); cf. Hira\nbayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 100 (1943)\n(“[R]acial discriminations are in most circumstances ir\nrelevant and therefore prohibited”). And appropriately so.\n“The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not\nonly because those classifications can harm favored races\nor are based on illegitimate motives, but also because\nevery time the government places citizens on racial regis\nters and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens\nor benefits, it demeans us all.” Grutter, supra, at 353\n\f6           PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                    SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Therefore, as a general rule, all\nrace-based government decisionmaking—regardless of\ncontext—is unconstitutional.\n                             2\n  This Court has carved out a narrow exception to that\ngeneral rule for cases in which a school district has a\n“history of maintaining two sets of schools in a single\nschool system deliberately operated to carry out a govern\nmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the\nbasis of race.”4 See Swann, 402 U. S., at 5–6. In such\ncases, race-based remedial measures are sometimes re\nquired.5 Green, 391 U. S., at 437–438; cf. United States v.\nFordice, 505 U.

See, e.g., post, at 19–\n20. That determination typically will not be nearly as difficult as the\ndissent makes it seem. In most cases, there either will or will not have\nbeen a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance,\nor local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the\nraces. See, e.g., n. 1, supra. And even if the determination is difficult,\nit is one the dissent acknowledges must be made to determine what\nremedies school districts are required to adopt. Post, at 43.\n   5 This Court’s opinion in McDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U. S. 39 (1971), fits\n\ncomfortably within this framework. There, a Georgia school board\nvoluntarily adopted a desegregation plan. At the time of Brown, v.\nBoard of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), Georgia’s Constitution\nrequired that “[s]eparate schools shall be provided for the white and\ncolored races.” Ga. Const., Art. VII, §1, ch. 2–6401 (1948). Given that\nstate law had previously required the school board to maintain a dual\nschool system, the county was obligated to take measures to remedy its\nprior de jure segregation. This Court recognized as much in its opinion,\nwhich stated that the school board had an “affirmative duty to disestab\nlish the dual school system.” McDaniel, supra, at 41.\n   6 As I have explained elsewhere, the remedies this Court authorized\n\nlower courts to compel in early desegregation cases like Green and\nSwann were exceptional. See Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U. S. 70, 124–\n125 (1995), (THOMAS, J., concurring).

Jefferson Cty. Bd. of\nEd., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 376–377 (WD Ky. 2000), that\ndecree was dissolved in 2000, id., at 360. Since then, no\nrace-based remedial measures have been required in\nLouisville. Thus, the race-based student-assignment plan\nat issue here, which was instituted the year after the\ndissolution of the desegregation decree, was not even\narguably required by the Constitution.\n\n——————\nmeasures (like compelled racial mixing) to turn the Constitution’s\ndictate to desegregate into reality. 515 U. S., at 125 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring). Even if these measures were appropriate as remedies in\nthe face of widespread resistance to Brown’s mandate, they are not\nforever insulated from constitutional scrutiny. Rather, “such powers\nshould have been temporary and used only to overcome the widespread\nresistance to the dictates of the Constitution.” 515 U. S., at 125 (THO\nMAS, J., concurring).\n   7 Though the dissent cites every manner of complaint, record mate\n\nrial, and scholarly article relating to Seattle’s race-based student\nassignment efforts, post, at 73–75, it cites no law or official policy that\nrequired separation of the races in Seattle’s schools. Nevertheless, the\ndissent tries to cast doubt on the historical fact that the Seattle schools\nwere never segregated by law by citing allegations that the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and other organiza\ntions made in court filings to the effect that Seattle’s schools were once\nsegregated by law. See post, at 7–9, 23. These allegations were never\nproved and were not even made in this case. Indeed, the record before\nus suggests the contrary.

See Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267,\n277 (1986) (plurality opinion). Regardless of the constitu\ntional validity of such remediation, see Croson, supra, at\n524–525 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), it does not\napply here. Again, neither school board asserts that its\nrace-based actions were taken to remedy prior discrimina\ntion. Seattle provides three forward-looking—as opposed\nto remedial—justifications for its race-based assignment\nplan. Brief for Respondents in No. 05–908, pp. 24–34.\nLouisville asserts several similar forward-looking inter\nests, Brief for Respondents in No. 05–915, pp. 24–29, and\nat oral argument, counsel for Louisville disavowed any\nclaim that Louisville’s argument “depend[ed] in any way\non the prior de jure segregation,” Tr. of Oral Arg. in No.\n05–915, p. 38.\n   Furthermore, for a government unit to remedy past\ndiscrimination for which it was responsible, the Court has\nrequired it to demonstrate “a ‘strong basis in evidence for\nits conclusion that remedial action was necessary.’ ” Cro\nson, 488 U. S., at 500 (quoting Wygant, supra, at 277\n(plurality opinion)). Establishing a “strong basis in evi\ndence” requires proper findings regarding the extent of the\ngovernment unit’s past racial discrimination. Croson, 488\nU. S., at 504. The findings should “define the scope of any\ninjury [and] the necessary remedy,” id., at 505, and must\nbe more than “inherently unmeasurable claims of past\nwrongs,” id., at 506. Assertions of general societal dis\ncrimination are plainly insufficient. Id., at 499, 504;\nWygant, supra, at 274 (plurality opinion); cf. Regents of\nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 310 (1978) (opinion\nof Powell, J.). Neither school district has made any such\nspecific findings. For Seattle, the dissent attempts to\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)                     9\n\n                         THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nmake up for this failing by adverting to allegations made\nin past complaints filed against the Seattle school district.\nHowever, allegations in complaints cannot substitute for\nspecific findings of prior discrimination—even when those\nallegations lead to settlements with complaining parties.\nCf. Croson, supra, at 505; Wygant, supra, at 279, n. 5\n(plurality opinion). As for Louisville, its slate was cleared\nby the District Court’s 2000 dissolution decree, which\neffectively declared that there were no longer any effects\nof de jure discrimination in need of remediation.8\n   Despite the dissent’s repeated intimation of a remedial\npurpose, neither of the programs in question qualifies as a\npermissible race-based remedial measure.           Thus, the\nprograms are subject to the general rule that government\nrace-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional.\n                              C\n  As the foregoing demonstrates, racial balancing is some\ntimes a constitutionally permissible remedy for the dis\ncrete legal wrong of de jure segregation, and when directed\nto that end, racial balancing is an exception to the general\nrule that government race-based decisionmaking is uncon\n——————\n  8 Contrary to the dissent’s argument, post, at 44, the Louisville school\n\ndistrict’s interest in remedying its past de jure segregation did vanish\nthe day the District Court found that Louisville had eliminated the\nvestiges of its historic de jure segregation. See Hampton v. Jefferson\nCty. Bd. of Ed., 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, at 360 (WD Ky. 2000). If there\nwere further remediation to be done, the District Court could not\nlogically have reached the conclusion that Louisville “ha[d] eliminated\nthe vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its\npernicious effects.” Ibid. Because Louisville could use race-based\nmeasures only as a remedy for past de jure segregation, it is not “inco\nherent,” post, at 56, to say that race-based decisionmaking was allowed\nto Louisville one day—while it was still remedying—and forbidden to it\nthe next—when remediation was finished. That seemingly odd turn\naround is merely a result of the fact that the remediation of de jure\nsegregation is a jealously guarded exception to the Equal Protection\nClause’s general rule against government race-based decisionmaking.\n\f10    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  THOMAS, J., concurring\n\n\nstitutional. Perhaps for this reason, the dissent conflates\nthe concepts of segregation and racial imbalance: If racial\nimbalance equates to segregation, then it must also be\nconstitutionally acceptable to use racial balancing to\nremedy racial imbalance.\n   For at least two reasons, however, it is wrong to place\nthe remediation of segregation on the same plane as the\nremediation of racial imbalance. First, as demonstrated\nabove, the two concepts are distinct. Although racial\nimbalance can result from de jure segregation, it does not\nnecessarily, and the further we get from the era of state-\nsponsored racial separation, the less likely it is that racial\nimbalance has a traceable connection to any prior segrega\ntion. See Freeman, 503 U. S., at 496; Jenkins, 515 U. S.,\nat 118 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\n   Second, a school cannot “remedy” racial imbalance in\nthe same way that it can remedy segregation. Remedia\ntion of past de jure segregation is a one-time process in\nvolving the redress of a discrete legal injury inflicted by an\nidentified entity. At some point, the discrete injury will be\nremedied, and the school district will be declared unitary.\nSee Swann, 402 U. S., at 31. Unlike de jure segregation,\nthere is no ultimate remedy for racial imbalance. Individ\nual schools will fall in and out of balance in the natural\ncourse, and the appropriate balance itself will shift with a\nschool district’s changing demographics. Thus, racial\nbalancing will have to take place on an indefinite basis—a\ncontinuous process with no identifiable culpable party and\nno discernable end point. In part for those reasons, the\nCourt has never permitted outright racial balancing solely\nfor the purpose of achieving a particular racial balance.\n                           II\n  Lacking a cognizable interest in remediation, neither of\nthese plans can survive strict scrutiny because neither\nplan serves a genuinely compelling state interest.

Ultimately, the dissent’s\nentire analysis is corrupted by the considerations that lead\nit initially to question whether strict scrutiny should apply\nat all. What emerges is a version of “strict scrutiny” that\ncombines hollow assurances of harmlessness with reflex\nive acceptance of conventional wisdom. When it comes to\ngovernment race-based decisionmaking, the Constitution\ndemands more.\n                              A\n   The dissent claims that “the law requires application\nhere of a standard of review that is not ‘strict’ in the tradi\ntional sense of that word.” Post, at 36. This view is in\nformed by dissents in our previous cases and the concur\nrences of two Court of Appeals judges. Post, at 34–36\n(citing 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1194 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski,\nJ., concurring); Comfort v. Lynn School Comm., 418 F. 3d\n1, 28–29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring)). Those\nlower court judges reasoned that programs like these are\nnot “aimed at oppressing blacks” and do not “seek to give\none racial group an edge over another.” Comfort, supra, at\n27 (Boudin, C. J., concurring); 426 F. 3d, at 1193 (Kozin\nski, J., concurring). They were further persuaded that\nthese plans differed from other race-based programs this\nCourt has considered because they are “certainly more\nbenign than laws that favor or disfavor one race, segregate\nby race, or create quotas for or against a racial group,”\nComfort, 418 F. 3d, at 28 (Boudin, C. J., concurring), and\nthey are “far from the original evils at which the Four\nteenth Amendment was addressed,” id., at 29; 426 F. 3d,\nat 1195 (Kozinski, J., concurring). Instead of strict scru\ntiny, Judge Kozinski would have analyzed the plans under\n“robust and realistic rational basis review.” Id., at 1194.\n\f12        PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                  SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

S., at 227; Grutter, 539 U. S., at 326;\nJohnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005) (“We have\ninsisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-\ncalled ‘benign’ racial classifications”).10 There are good\nreasons not to apply a lesser standard to these cases. The\nconstitutional problems with government race-based\ndecisionmaking are not diminished in the slightest by the\npresence or absence of an intent to oppress any race or by\nthe real or asserted well-meaning motives for the race-\nbased decisionmaking. Adarand, 515 U. S., at 228–229.\nPurportedly benign race-based decisionmaking suffers the\nsame constitutional infirmity as invidious race-based\ndecisionmaking. Id., at 240 (THOMAS, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment) (“As far as the Constitu\ntion is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government’s\nracial classifications are drawn by those who wish to\noppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to\nhelp those thought to be disadvantaged”).\n   Even supposing it mattered to the constitutional analy\nsis, the race-based student assignment programs before us\n——————\n  9 The  dissent’s appeal to stare decisis, post, at 65, is particularly ironic\nin light of its apparent willingness to depart from these precedents,\npost, at 36–37.\n  10 The idea that government racial classifications must be subjected\n\nto strict scrutiny did not originate in Adarand. As early as Loving v.\nVirginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), this Court made clear that government\naction that “rest[s] solely upon distinctions drawn according to race”\nhad to be “subjected to the ‘most rigid scrutiny.’ ” Id., at 11 (quoting\nKorematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 216 (1944)); see also\nMcLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184, 196 (1964) (requiring a statute\ndrawing a racial classification to be “necessary, and not merely ration\nally related, to accomplishment of a permissible state policy”); id., at\n197 (Harlan, J., concurring) (“The necessity test . . . should be equally\napplicable in a case involving state racial discrimination”).\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            13\n\n                     THOMAS, J., concurring\n\nare not as benign as the dissent believes. See post, at 34–\n35. “[R]acial paternalism and its unintended conse\nquences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other\nform of discrimination.” Adarand, supra, at 241 (opinion\nof THOMAS, J.). As these programs demonstrate, every\ntime the government uses racial criteria to “bring the\nraces together,” post, at 29, someone gets excluded, and\nthe person excluded suffers an injury solely because of his\nor her race. The petitioner in the Louisville case received\na letter from the school board informing her that her\nkindergartener would not be allowed to attend the school\nof petitioner’s choosing because of the child’s race. App. in\nNo. 05–915, p. 97. Doubtless, hundreds of letters like this\nwent out from both school boards every year these race-\nbased assignment plans were in operation. This type of\nexclusion, solely on the basis of race, is precisely the sort\nof government action that pits the races against one an\nother, exacerbates racial tension, and “provoke[s] resent\nment among those who believe that they have been\nwronged by the government’s use of race.” Adarand,\nsupra, at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Accordingly, these\nplans are simply one more variation on the government\nrace-based decisionmaking we have consistently held must\nbe subjected to strict scrutiny. Grutter, supra, at 326.\n                                 B\n   Though the dissent admits to discomfort in applying\nstrict scrutiny to these plans, it claims to have nonetheless\napplied that exacting standard. But in its search for a\ncompelling interest, the dissent casually accepts even the\nmost tenuous interests asserted on behalf of the plans,\ngrouping them all under the term “ ‘integration.’ ” See\npost, at 37. “ ‘[I]ntegration,’ ” we are told, has “three essen\ntial elements.” Ibid. None of these elements is compel\nling. And the combination of the three unsubstantiated\nelements does not produce an interest any more compel\n\f14       PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                 SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

For the reasons explained\nabove, the records in these cases do not demonstrate that\neither school board’s plan is supported by an interest in\nremedying past discrimination. Part I–B, supra.\n  Moreover, the school boards have no interest in remedy\ning the sundry consequences of prior segregation unre\nlated to schooling, such as “housing patterns, employment\npractices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.” Post,\nat 38. General claims that past school segregation af\nfected such varied societal trends are “too amorphous a\nbasis for imposing a racially classified remedy,” Wygant,\n476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion), because “[i]t is sheer\nspeculation” how decades-past segregation in the school\nsystem might have affected these trends, see Croson, 488\nU. S., at 499. Consequently, school boards seeking to\nremedy those societal problems with race-based measures\nin schools today would have no way to gauge the proper\nscope of the remedy. Id., at 498. Indeed, remedial meas\nures geared toward such broad and unrelated societal ills\nhave “ ‘no logical stopping point,’ ” ibid., and threaten to\nbecome “ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless\nin their ability to affect the future,” Wygant, supra, at 276\n(plurality opinion). See Grutter, 539 U. S., at 342 (stating\nthe “requirement that all governmental use of race must\nhave a logical end point”).\n  Because the school boards lack any further interest in\nremedying segregation, this element offers no support for\nthe purported interest in “integration.”\n                               2\n     Next, the dissent argues that the interest in integration\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

The dissent asserts that\nracially balanced schools improve educational outcomes\nfor black children. In support, the dissent unquestioningly\ncites certain social science research to support proposi\ntions that are hotly disputed among social scientists. In\nreality, it is far from apparent that coerced racial mixing\nhas any educational benefits, much less that integration is\nnecessary to black achievement.\n    Scholars have differing opinions as to whether educa\ntional benefits arise from racial balancing. Some have\nconcluded that black students receive genuine educational\nbenefits. See, e.g., Crain & Mahard, Desegregation and\nBlack Achievement: A Review of the Research, 42 L. &\nContemp. Probs. 17, 48 (1978). Others have been more\ncircumspect. See, e.g., Henderson, Greenberg, Schneider,\nUribe, & Verdugo, High Quality Schooling for African\nAmerican Students, in Beyond Desegregation 166 (M.\nShujaa ed. 1996) (“Perhaps desegregation does not have a\nsingle effect, positive or negative, on the academic\nachievement of African American students, but rather\nsome strategies help, some hurt, and still others make no\ndifference whatsoever. It is clear to us that focusing sim\nply on demographic issues detracts from focusing on im\nproving schools”). And some have concluded that there\nare no demonstrable educational benefits. See, e.g., Armor\n& Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public\nSchools, in Beyond the Color Line: New Perspectives on\nRace and Ethnicity in America 239, 251 (A. Thernstrom &\nS. Thernstrom eds. 2002).\n    The amicus briefs in the cases before us mirror this\ndivergence of opinion.

Another brief claims that\n“school desegregation has a modest positive impact on the\nachievement of African-American students.” App. to Brief\nfor 553 Social Scientists as Amici Curiae 13–14 (footnote\nomitted). Yet neither of those briefs contains specific\ndetails like the magnitude of the claimed positive effects\nor the precise demographic mix at which those positive\neffects begin to be realized. Indeed, the social scientists’\nbrief rather cautiously claims the existence of any benefit\nat all, describing the “positive impact” as “modest,” id., at\n13, acknowledging that “there appears to be little or no\neffect on math scores,” id., at 14, and admitting that the\n“underlying reasons for these gains in achievement are not\nentirely clear,” id., at 15.11\n   Other amici dispute these findings.

In the pages following\nthe ones the dissent cites, the author of that article remarks that “the\nmain reason white and minority students perform better academically\nin majority white schools is likely that these schools provide greater\nopportunities to learn. In other words, it is not desegregation per se\nthat improves achievement, but rather the learning advantages some\ndesegregated schools provide.” Id., at 744.

See T.\nSowell, Education: Assumptions Versus History 7–38\n(1986). Before Brown, the most prominent example of an\nexemplary black school was Dunbar High School. Id., at\n29 (“[I]n the period 1918–1923, Dunbar graduates earned\nfifteen degrees from Ivy League colleges, and ten degrees\nfrom Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan”). Dunbar is by no\nmeans an isolated example. See id., at 10–32 (discussing\nother successful black schools); Walker, Can Institutions\nCare? Evidence from the Segregated Schooling of African\nAmerican Children, in Beyond Desegregation 209–226 (M.\nShujaa ed. 1996); see also T. Sowell, Affirmative Action\nAround the World: An Empirical Study 141–165 (2004).\nEven after Brown, some schools with predominantly black\nenrollments have achieved outstanding educational re\nsults. See, e.g., S. Carter, No Excuses: Lessons from 21\nHigh-Performing, High-Poverty Schools 49–50, 53–56, 71–\n73, 81–84, 87–88 (2001); A. Thernstrom & S.

That\nschool was founded in 1990 as part of the school board’s\neffort to “increase academic achievement.”12 See African\nAmerican Academy History, online at http://www.\nseattleschools.org/schools/aaa/history.htm (all Internet\nmaterials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk\nof Court’s case file). According to the school’s most recent\nannual report, “[a]cademic excellence” is its “primary\ngoal.” See African American Academy 2006 Annual Re\nport, p. 2, online at http://www.seattleschools.org/area/\nsiso/reports/anrep/altern/938.pdf.    This racially imbal\nanced environment has reportedly produced test scores\n“higher across all grade levels in reading, writing and\nmath.” Ibid. Contrary to what the dissent would have\npredicted, see post, at 38–39, the children in Seattle’s\nAfrican American Academy have shown gains when placed\nin a “highly segregated” environment.\n   Given this tenuous relationship between forced racial\nmixing and improved educational results for black chil\ndren, the dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educa\ntional element supports the integration interest, let alone\nmakes it compelling.13 See Jenkins, 515 U. S., at 121–122\n——————\n  12 Of course, if the Seattle school board were truly committed to the\nnotion that diversity leads directly to educational benefits, operating a\nschool with such a high “nonwhite” enrollment would be a shocking\ndereliction of its duty to educate the students enrolled in that school.\n  13 In fact, the available data from the Seattle school district appear to\n\nundercut the dissent’s view. A comparison of the test results of the\nschools in the last year the racial balancing program operated to the\nresults in the 2004-to-2005 school year (in which student assignments\nwere race-neutral) does not indicate the decline in black achieve-\nment one would expect to find if black achievement were contin-\ngent upon a particular racial mix.

It is not up to the school\nboards—the very government entities whose race-based\npractices we must strictly scrutinize—to determine what\ninterests qualify as compelling under the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.

See post, at 62. Regardless of what JUSTICE BREYER’s goals\nmight be, this Court does not sit to “create a society that includes all\nAmericans” or to solve the problems of “troubled inner city schooling.”\nIbid. We are not social engineers. The United States Constitution\ndictates that local governments cannot make decisions on the basis of\nrace. Consequently, regardless of the perceived negative effects of\nracial imbalance, I will not defer to legislative majorities where the\nConstitution forbids it.\n   It should escape no one that behind JUSTICE BREYER’s veil of judicial\nmodesty hides an inflated role for the Federal Judiciary. The dissent’s\napproach confers on judges the power to say what sorts of discrimina\ntion are benign and which are invidious. Having made that determina\ntion (based on no objective measure that I can detect), a judge following\nthe dissent’s approach will set the level of scrutiny to achieve the\ndesired result. Only then must the judge defer to a democratic major\nity. In my view, to defer to one’s preferred result is not to defer at all.\n   15 The notion that a “democratic” interest qualifies as a compelling\n\ninterest (or constitutes a part of a compelling interest) is proposed for\nthe first time in today’s dissent and has little basis in the Constitution\nor our precedent, which has narrowly restricted the interests that\nqualify as compelling. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306, 351–354\n(2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The\nFourteenth Amendment does not enact the dissent’s newly minted\n\f                   Cite as: 551 U.

S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.).\n“This the Constitution forbids.” Ibid.; Grutter, supra, at\n329–330; Freeman, 503 U. S., at 494.\n   Navigating around that inconvenient authority, the\ndissent argues that the racial balancing in these plans is\nnot an end in itself but is instead intended to “teac[h]\nchildren to engage in the kind of cooperation among\nAmericans of all races that is necessary to make a land of\nthree hundred million people one Nation.” Post, at 39–40.\nThese “generic lessons in socialization and good citizen\nship” are too sweeping to qualify as compelling interests.\nGrutter, 539 U. S., at 348 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part). And they are not “uniquely rele\nvant” to schools or “uniquely ‘teachable’ in a formal educa\ntional setting.” Id., at 347. Therefore, if governments may\nconstitutionally use racial balancing to achieve these\naspirational ends in schools, they may use racial balancing\nto achieve similar goals at every level—from state-\nsponsored 4–H clubs, see Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S.\n385, 388–390 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring), to the state\ncivil service. See Grutter, 539 U. S. 347–348 (opinion of\nSCALIA, J.).\n   Moreover, the democratic interest has no durational\nlimit, contrary to Grutter’s command. See id., at 342; see\nalso Croson, 488 U. S., at 498; Wygant, 476 U. S., at 275\n(plurality opinion). In other words, it will always be im\nportant for students to learn cooperation among the races.\nIf this interest justifies race-conscious measures today,\nthen logically it will justify race-conscious measures for\n—————— \n\nunderstanding of liberty. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 75\n\n(1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (“The Fourteenth Amendment does not \n\nenact Mr. Herbert Spencer’s Social Statics”). \n\n\f22      PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Thus, the democratic interest, limitless in scope and\n“timeless in [its] ability to affect the future,” id., at 276\n(plurality opinion), cannot justify government race-based\ndecisionmaking.16\n   In addition to these defects, the democratic element of\nthe integration interest fails on the dissent’s own terms.\nThe dissent again relies upon social science research to\nsupport the proposition that state-compelled racial mixing\nteaches children to accept cooperation and improves racial\nattitudes and race relations. Here again, though, the\ndissent overstates the data that supposedly support the\ninterest.\n   The dissent points to data that indicate that “black and\nwhite students in desegregated schools are less racially\nprejudiced than those in segregated schools.” Post, at 40\n(internal quotation marks omitted). By the dissent’s\naccount, improvements in racial attitudes depend upon\nthe increased contact between black and white students\nthought to occur in more racially balanced schools. There\nis no guarantee, however, that students of different races\nin the same school will actually spend time with one an\nother. Schools frequently group students by academic\n——————\n   16 The dissent does not explain how its recognition of an interest in\n\nteaching racial understanding and cooperation here is consistent with\nthe Court’s rejection of a similar interest in Wygant. In Wygant, a\nschool district justified its race-based teacher-layoff program in part on\nthe theory that “minority teachers provided ‘role models’ for minority\nstudents and that a racially ‘diverse’ faculty would improve the educa\ntion of all students.” Grutter, supra, at 352 (opinion of THOMAS, J.)\n(citing Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1984, No. 84–1340, pp. 27–28; 476\nU. S., at 315 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)). The Court rejected the inter\nests asserted to justify the layoff program as insufficiently compelling.\nWygant, 476 U. S., at 275–276 (plurality opinion); id., at 295 (White, J.,\nconcurring in judgment). If a school district has an interest in teaching\nracial understanding and cooperation, there is no logical reason why\nthat interest should not extend to the composition of the teaching staff\nas well as the composition of the student body. The dissent’s reliance\non this interest is, therefore, inconsistent with Wygant.\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

See, e.g., Yonezawa, Wells, & Serna,\nChoosing Tracks: “Freedom of Choice” in Detracting\nSchools, 39 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 1, p. 38 (Spring\n2002); Mickelson, Subverting Swann: First- and Second-\nGeneration Segregation in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg\nSchools, 38 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 2, pp. 233–234\n(Summer 2001) (describing this effect in schools in Char\nlotte, North Carolina). In addition to classroom separa\ntion, students of different races within the same school\nmay separate themselves socially. See Hallinan & Wil\nliams, Interracial Friendship Choices in Secondary\nSchools, 54 Am. Sociological Rev., No. 1, pp. 72–76 (Feb.\n1989); see also Clotfelter, Interracial Contact in High\nSchool Extracurricular Activities, 34 Urban Rev., No. 1,\npp. 41–43 (Mar. 2002). Therefore, even supposing interra\ncial contact leads directly to improvements in racial atti\ntudes and race relations, a program that assigns students\nof different races to the same schools might not capture\nthose benefits. Simply putting students together under\nthe same roof does not necessarily mean that the students\nwill learn together or even interact.\n   Furthermore, it is unclear whether increased interracial\ncontact improves racial attitudes and relations.17 One\n——————\n  17 Outside the school context, this Court’s cases reflect the fact that\n\nracial mixing does not always lead to harmony and understanding. In\nJohnson v. California, 543 U. S. 499 (2005), this Court considered a\nCalifornia prison policy that separated inmates racially. Id., at 525–\n528 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). That policy was necessary because of\n“numerous incidents of racial violence.” Id., at 502; id., at 532–534\n(THOMAS, J., dissenting). As a result of this Court’s insistence on strict\nscrutiny of that policy, but see id., at 538–547, inmates in the Califor\nnia prisons were killed. See Beard v. Banks, 548 U. S. ___, ___ (2006)\n(THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (noting that two were killed and\nhundreds were injured in race rioting subsequent to this Court’s\ndecision in Johnson).\n\f24      PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n                SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Grant ed. 1991). Some studies have even found\nthat a deterioration in racial attitudes seems to result\nfrom racial mixing in schools. See N. St. John, School\nDesegregation Outcomes for Children 67–68 (1975) (“A\nglance at [the data] shows that for either race positive\nfindings are less common than negative findings”);\nStephan, The Effects of School Desegregation: An Evalua\ntion 30 Years After Brown, in Advances in Applied Social\nPsychology 183–186 (M. Saks & L. Saxe eds. 1986).\nTherefore, it is not nearly as apparent as the dissent\nsuggests that increased interracial exposure automatically\nleads to improved racial attitudes or race relations.\n   Given our case law and the paucity of evidence support\ning the dissent’s belief that these plans improve race\nrelations, no democratic element can support the integra\ntion interest.18\n                             4\n  The dissent attempts to buttress the integration interest\nby claiming that it follows a fortiori from the interest this\n——————\n  18 After discussing the “democratic element,” the dissent repeats its\n\nassertion that the social science evidence supporting that interest is\n“sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine . . . that this\ninterest is compelling.” Post, at 40. Again, though, the school boards\nhave no say in deciding whether an interest is compelling. Strict\nscrutiny of race-based government decisionmaking is more searching\nthan Chevron-style administrative review for reasonableness. See\nChevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467\nU. S. 837, 845 (1984).\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

Post, at 41.\nRegardless of the merit of Grutter, the compelling interest\nrecognized in that case cannot support these plans. Grut\nter recognized a compelling interest in a law school’s at\ntainment of a diverse student body. 539 U. S., at 328.\nThis interest was critically dependent upon features\nunique to higher education: “the expansive freedoms of\nspeech and thought associated with the university envi\nronment,” the “special niche in our constitutional tradi\ntion” occupied by universities, and “[t]he freedom of a\nuniversity to make its own judgments as to education[,]\ninclud[ing] the selection of its student body.” Id., at 329\n(internal quotation marks omitted). None of these fea\ntures is present in elementary and secondary schools.\nThose schools do not select their own students, and educa\ntion in the elementary and secondary environment gener\nally does not involve the free interchange of ideas thought\nto be an integral part of higher education. See 426 F. 3d,\nat 1208 (Bea, J., dissenting). Extending Grutter to this\ncontext would require us to cut that holding loose from its\ntheoretical moorings. Thus, only by ignoring Grutter’s\nreasoning can the dissent claim that recognizing a compel\nling interest in these cases is an a fortiori application of\nGrutter.\n                              C\n  Stripped of the baseless and novel interests the dissent\nasserts on their behalf, the school boards cannot plausibly\nmaintain that their plans further a compelling interest.\nAs I explained in Grutter, only “those measures the State\nmust take to provide a bulwark against anarchy . . . or to\nprevent violence” and “a government’s effort to remedy\npast discrimination for which it is responsible” constitute\ncompelling interests. 539 U.

Post, at 28 (citing\nSlaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 71–72 (1873)). What the dissent\nfails to understand, however, is that the color-blind Constitution does\nnot bar the government from taking measures to remedy past state-\nsponsored discrimination—indeed, it requires that such measures be\ntaken in certain circumstances. See, e.g., Part I–B, supra. Race-based\ngovernment measures during the 1860’s and 1870’s to remedy state-\nenforced slavery were therefore not inconsistent with the color-blind\nConstitution.\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

And the inquiry into less restrictive\nalternatives demanded by the narrow tailoring analysis\nrequires in many cases a thorough understanding of how a\nplan works. The government bears the burden of justify\ning its use of individual racial classifications. As part of\nthat burden it must establish, in detail, how decisions\nbased on an individual student’s race are made in a chal\nlenged governmental program.

See, e.g., id., at 1–11.\n   The district has identified its purposes as follows: “(1) to\npromote the educational benefits of diverse school enroll\nments; (2) to reduce the potentially harmful effects of\nracial isolation by allowing students the opportunity to opt\nout of racially isolated schools; and (3) to make sure that\nracially segregated housing patterns did not prevent non\nwhite students from having equitable access to the most\npopular over-subscribed schools.” Id., at 19. Yet the\nschool district does not explain how, in the context of its\ndiverse student population, a blunt distinction between\n“white” and “non-white” furthers these goals. As the\nCourt explains, “a school with 50 percent Asian-American\nstudents and 50 percent white students but no African-\nAmerican, Native-American, or Latino students would\nqualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-\nAmerican, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent La\ntino, and 20 percent white students would not.” Ante, at\n15–16; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae\nin No. 05–908, pp. 13–14. Far from being narrowly tai\nlored to its purposes, this system threatens to defeat its\nown ends, and the school district has provided no convinc\ning explanation for its design. Other problems are evident\nin Seattle’s system, but there is no need to address them\nnow. As the district fails to account for the classification\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

Today we enjoy a society that is remarkable\nin its openness and opportunity. Yet our tradition is to go\nbeyond present achievements, however significant, and to\nrecognize and confront the flaws and injustices that re\nmain. This is especially true when we seek assurance that\nopportunity is not denied on account of race. The endur\ning hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that\ntoo often it does.\n   This is by way of preface to my respectful submission\nthat parts of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE imply an\nall-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in\ninstances when, in my view, it may be taken into account.\nThe plurality opinion is too dismissive of the legitimate\ninterest government has in ensuring all people have equal\nopportunity regardless of their race. The plurality’s postu\nlate that “[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of\nrace is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,” ante, at\n40–41, is not sufficient to decide these cases. Fifty years\nof experience since Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S.\n483 (1954), should teach us that the problem before us\ndefies so easy a solution. School districts can seek to reach\nBrown’s objective of equal educational opportunity. The\nplurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that\nthe Constitution requires school districts to ignore the\nproblem of de facto resegregation in schooling. I cannot\nendorse that conclusion. To the extent the plurality opin\nion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and\nlocal school authorities must accept the status quo of\n\f8     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                 Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nracial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly\nmistaken.\n   The statement by Justice Harlan that “[o]ur Constitu\ntion is color-blind” was most certainly justified in the\ncontext of his dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537,\n559 (1896). The Court’s decision in that case was a griev\nous error it took far too long to overrule. Plessy, of course,\nconcerned official classification by race applicable to all\npersons who sought to use railway carriages. And, as an\naspiration, Justice Harlan’s axiom must command our\nassent. In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot\nbe a universal constitutional principle.\n   In the administration of public schools by the state and\nlocal authorities it is permissible to consider the racial\nmakeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encour\nage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial\ncomposition. Cf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 306 (2003);\nid., at 387–388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). If school au\nthorities are concerned that the student-body compositions\nof certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an\nequal educational opportunity to all of their students, they\nare free to devise race-conscious measures to address the\nproblem in a general way and without treating each stu\ndent in different fashion solely on the basis of a system\natic, individual typing by race.\n   School boards may pursue the goal of bringing together\nstudents of diverse backgrounds and races through other\nmeans, including strategic site selection of new schools;\ndrawing attendance zones with general recognition of the\ndemographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for\nspecial programs; recruiting students and faculty in a\ntargeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance,\nand other statistics by race. These mechanisms are race\nconscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a\nclassification that tells each student he or she is to be\ndefined by race, so it is unlikely any of them would de\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

S. 952, 958 (1996) (plurality opinion) (“Strict\nscrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is\nperformed with consciousness of race. . . . Electoral district\nlines are ‘facially race neutral’ so a more searching inquiry\nis necessary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable\nin redistricting cases than in cases of ‘classifications based\nexplicitly on race’ ” (quoting Adarand, 515 U. S., at 213)).\nExecutive and legislative branches, which for generations\nnow have considered these types of policies and proce\ndures, should be permitted to employ them with candor\nand with confidence that a constitutional violation does\nnot occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact\na given approach might have on students of different\nraces. Assigning to each student a personal designation\naccording to a crude system of individual racial classifica\ntions is quite a different matter; and the legal analysis\nchanges accordingly.\n   Each respondent has asserted that its assignment of\nindividual students by race is permissible because there is\nno other way to avoid racial isolation in the school dis\ntricts. Yet, as explained, each has failed to provide the\nsupport necessary for that proposition. Cf. Croson, 488\nU. S., at 501 (“The history of racial classifications in this\ncountry suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative\nor executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in\nequal protection analysis”). And individual racial classifi\ncations employed in this manner may be considered le\ngitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compel\nling interest. See id., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in judgment).\n   In the cases before us it is noteworthy that the number\nof students whose assignment depends on express racial\nclassifications is limited. I join Part III–C of the Court’s\nopinion because I agree that in the context of these plans,\nthe small number of assignments affected suggests that\n\f10    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                 Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nthe schools could have achieved their stated ends through\ndifferent means. These include the facially race-neutral\nmeans set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced,\nindividual evaluation of school needs and student charac\nteristics that might include race as a component. The\nlatter approach would be informed by Grutter, though of\ncourse the criteria relevant to student placement would\ndiffer based on the age of the students, the needs of the\nparents, and the role of the schools.\n                              III\n   The dissent rests on the assumptions that these sweep\ning race-based classifications of persons are permitted by\nexisting precedents; that its confident endorsement of race\ncategories for each child in a large segment of the commu\nnity presents no danger to individual freedom in other,\nprospective realms of governmental regulation; and that\nthe racial classifications used here cause no hurt or anger\nof the type the Constitution prevents. Each of these prem\nises is, in my respectful view, incorrect.\n                             A\n   The dissent’s reliance on this Court’s precedents to\njustify the explicit, sweeping, classwide racial classifica\ntions at issue here is a misreading of our authorities that,\nit appears to me, tends to undermine well-accepted princi\nples needed to guard our freedom. And in his critique of\nthat analysis, I am in many respects in agreement with\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. The conclusions he has set forth in\nPart III–A of the Court’s opinion are correct, in my view,\nbecause the compelling interests implicated in the cases\nbefore us are distinct from the interests the Court has\nrecognized in remedying the effects of past intentional\ndiscrimination and in increasing diversity in higher edu\ncation. See ante, at 12–13. As the Court notes, we recog\nnized the compelling nature of the interest in remedying\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

S. 467, 494 (1992), and of the interest in diversity in\nhigher education in Grutter. At the same time, these\ncompelling interests, in my view, do help inform the pre\nsent inquiry. And to the extent the plurality opinion can\nbe interpreted to foreclose consideration of these interests,\nI disagree with that reasoning.\n   As to the dissent, the general conclusions upon which it\nrelies have no principled limit and would result in the\nbroad acceptance of governmental racial classifications in\nareas far afield from schooling. The dissent’s permissive\nstrict scrutiny (which bears more than a passing resem\nblance to rational-basis review) could invite widespread\ngovernmental deployment of racial classifications. There\nis every reason to think that, if the dissent’s rationale\nwere accepted, Congress, assuming an otherwise proper\nexercise of its spending authority or commerce power,\ncould mandate either the Seattle or the Jefferson County\nplans nationwide. There seems to be no principled rule,\nmoreover, to limit the dissent’s rationale to the context of\npublic schools. The dissent emphasizes local control, see\npost, at 48–49, the unique history of school desegregation,\nsee post, at 2, and the fact that these plans make less use\nof race than prior plans, see post, at 57, but these factors\nseem more rhetorical than integral to the analytical struc\nture of the opinion.\n   This brings us to the dissent’s reliance on the Court’s\nopinions in Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244 (2003), and\nGrutter, 539 U. S. 306. If today’s dissent said it was ad\nhering to the views expressed in the separate opinions in\nGratz and Grutter, see Gratz, 539 U. S., at 281 (BREYER,\nJ., concurring in judgment); id., at 282 (STEVENS, J., dis\nsenting); id., at 291 (SOUTER, J., dissenting); id., at 298\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Grutter, supra, at 344\n(GINSBURG, J., concurring), that would be understandable,\nand likely within the tradition—to be invoked, in my view,\n\f12    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                 Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nin rare instances—that permits us to maintain our own\npositions in the face of stare decisis when fundamental\npoints of doctrine are at stake. See, e.g., Federal Maritime\nComm’n v. South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 U. S. 743,\n770 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). To say, however,\nthat we must ratify the racial classifications here at issue\nbased on the majority opinions in Gratz and Grutter is,\nwith all respect, simply baffling.\n   Gratz involved a system where race was not the entire\nclassification. The procedures in Gratz placed much less\nreliance on race than do the plans at issue here. The issue\nin Gratz arose, moreover, in the context of college admis\nsions where students had other choices and precedent\nsupported the proposition that First Amendment interests\ngive universities particular latitude in defining diversity.\nSee Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 312–\n314 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Even so the race factor\nwas found to be invalid. Gratz, supra, at 251. If Gratz is\nto be the measure, the racial classification systems here\nare a fortiori invalid. If the dissent were to say that col\nlege cases are simply not applicable to public school sys\ntems in kindergarten through high school, this would\nseem to me wrong, but at least an arguable distinction.\nUnder no fair reading, though, can the majority opinion in\nGratz be cited as authority to sustain the racial classifica\ntions under consideration here.\n   The same must be said for the controlling opinion in\nGrutter. There the Court sustained a system that, it\nfound, was flexible enough to take into account “all perti\nnent elements of diversity,” 539 U. S., at 341 (internal\nquotation marks omitted), and considered race as only one\nfactor among many, id., at 340. Seattle’s plan, by con\ntrast, relies upon a mechanical formula that has denied\nhundreds of students their preferred schools on the basis\nof three rigid criteria: placement of siblings, distance from\nschools, and race. If those students were considered for a\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

That, though, is not the case. The only support\ntoday’s dissent can draw from Grutter must be found in its\nvarious separate opinions, not in the opinion filed for the\nCourt.\n                               B\n   To uphold these programs the Court is asked to brush\naside two concepts of central importance for determining\nthe validity of laws and decrees designed to alleviate the\nhurt and adverse consequences resulting from race dis\ncrimination. The first is the difference between de jure\nand de facto segregation; the second, the presumptive\ninvalidity of a State’s use of racial classifications to differ\nentiate its treatment of individuals.\n   In the immediate aftermath of Brown the Court ad\ndressed other instances where laws and practices enforced\nde jure segregation. See, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S.\n1 (1967) (marriage); New Orleans City Park Improvement\nAssn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 (1958) (per curiam) (public\nparks); Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 (1956) (per cu\nriam) (buses); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955) (per\ncuriam) (golf courses); Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350\nU. S. 877 (1955) (per curiam) (beaches). But with refer\nence to schools, the effect of the legal wrong proved most\ndifficult to correct. To remedy the wrong, school districts\nthat had been segregated by law had no choice, whether\nunder court supervision or pursuant to voluntary desegre\ngation efforts, but to resort to extraordinary measures\nincluding individual student and teacher assignment to\nschools based on race. See, e.g., Swann v. Charlotte-\nMecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 8–10 (1971); see also\nCroson, 488 U. S., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part\nand concurring in judgment) (noting that racial classifica\ntions “may be the only adequate remedy after a judicial\n\f14     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\ndetermination that a State or its instrumentality has\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause”). So it was, as the\ndissent observes, see post, at 13–14, that Louisville classi\nfied children by race in its school assignment and busing\nplan in the 1970’s.\n   Our cases recognized a fundamental difference between\nthose school districts that had engaged in de jure segrega\ntion and those whose segregation was the result of other\nfactors. School districts that had engaged in de jure seg\nregation had an affirmative constitutional duty to deseg\nregate; those that were de facto segregated did not. Com\npare Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430,\n437–438 (1968), with Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S. 717,\n745 (1974). The distinctions between de jure and de facto\nsegregation extended to the remedies available to govern\nmental units in addition to the courts. For example, in\nWygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267, 274 (1986),\nthe plurality noted: “This Court never has held that socie\ntal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial\nclassification. Rather, the Court has insisted upon some\nshowing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit\ninvolved before allowing limited use of racial classifica\ntions in order to remedy such discrimination.” The Court’s\ndecision in Croson, supra, reinforced the difference be\ntween the remedies available to redress de facto and de\njure discrimination:\n     “To accept [a] claim that past societal discrimination\n     alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial prefer\n     ences would be to open the door to competing claims\n     for ‘remedial relief’ for every disadvantaged group.\n     The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society\n     where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and\n     achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting\n     preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims\n     of past wrongs.” Id., at 505–506.\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           15\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   From the standpoint of the victim, it is true, an injury\nstemming from racial prejudice can hurt as much when\nthe demeaning treatment based on race identity stems\nfrom bias masked deep within the social order as when it\nis imposed by law. The distinction between government\nand private action, furthermore, can be amorphous both as\na historical matter and as a matter of present-day finding\nof fact. Laws arise from a culture and vice versa. Neither\ncan assign to the other all responsibility for persisting\ninjustices.\n   Yet, like so many other legal categories that can overlap\nin some instances, the constitutional distinction between\nde jure and de facto segregation has been thought to be an\nimportant one. It must be conceded its primary function\nin school cases was to delimit the powers of the Judiciary\nin the fashioning of remedies. See, e.g., Milliken, supra, at\n746. The distinction ought not to be altogether disre\ngarded, however, when we come to that most sensitive of\nall racial issues, an attempt by the government to treat\nwhole classes of persons differently based on the govern\nment’s systematic classification of each individual by race.\nThere, too, the distinction serves as a limit on the exercise\nof a power that reaches to the very verge of constitutional\nauthority. Reduction of an individual to an assigned racial\nidentity for differential treatment is among the most\npernicious actions our government can undertake. The\nallocation of governmental burdens and benefits, conten\ntious under any circumstances, is even more divisive when\nallocations are made on the basis of individual racial\nclassifications. See, e.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke,\n438 U. S. 265 (1978); Adarand, 515 U. S. 200.\n   Notwithstanding these concerns, allocation of benefits\nand burdens through individual racial classifications was\nfound sometimes permissible in the context of remedies for\nde jure wrong. Where there has been de jure segregation,\nthere is a cognizable legal wrong, and the courts and\n\f16    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                 Opinion of KENNEDY, J. \n\n\nlegislatures have broad power to remedy it. The remedy,\nthough, was limited in time and limited to the wrong. The\nCourt has allowed school districts to remedy their prior de\njure segregation by classifying individual students based\non their race. See North Carolina Bd. of Ed. v. Swann,\n402 U. S. 43, 45–46 (1971). The limitation of this power to\ninstances where there has been de jure segregation serves\nto confine the nature, extent, and duration of governmen\ntal reliance on individual racial classifications.\n  The cases here were argued upon the assumption, and\ncome to us on the premise, that the discrimination in\nquestion did not result from de jure actions. And when de\nfacto discrimination is at issue our tradition has been that\nthe remedial rules are different. The State must seek\nalternatives to the classification and differential treat\nment of individuals by race, at least absent some extraor\ndinary showing not present here.\n                              C\n   The dissent refers to an opinion filed by Judge Kozinski\nin one of the cases now before us, and that opinion relied\nupon an opinion filed by Chief Judge Boudin in a case\npresenting an issue similar to the one here. See post, at\n35 (citing 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1196 (CA9 2005) (concur\nring opinion) (citing Comfort v. Lynn School Comm., 418\nF. 3d 1, 27–29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring))).\nThough this may oversimplify the matter a bit, one of the\nmain concerns underlying those opinions was this: If it is\nlegitimate for school authorities to work to avoid racial\nisolation in their schools, must they do so only by indirec\ntion and general policies? Does the Constitution mandate\nthis inefficient result? Why may the authorities not rec\nognize the problem in candid fashion and solve it alto\ngether through resort to direct assignments based on\nstudent racial classifications? So, the argument proceeds,\nif race is the problem, then perhaps race is the solution.\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                     Opinion of KENNEDY, J.\n\n   The argument ignores the dangers presented by indi\nvidual classifications, dangers that are not as pressing\nwhen the same ends are achieved by more indirect means.\nWhen the government classifies an individual by race, it\nmust first define what it means to be of a race. Who ex\nactly is white and who is nonwhite? To be forced to live\nunder a state-mandated racial label is inconsistent with\nthe dignity of individuals in our society. And it is a label\nthat an individual is powerless to change. Governmental\nclassifications that command people to march in different\ndirections based on racial typologies can cause a new\ndivisiveness. The practice can lead to corrosive discourse,\nwhere race serves not as an element of our diverse heri\ntage but instead as a bargaining chip in the political proc\ness. On the other hand race-conscious measures that do\nnot rely on differential treatment based on individual\nclassifications present these problems to a lesser degree.\n   The idea that if race is the problem, race is the instru\nment with which to solve it cannot be accepted as an\nanalytical leap forward. And if this is a frustrating dual\nity of the Equal Protection Clause it simply reflects the\nduality of our history and our attempts to promote free\ndom in a world that sometimes seems set against it.\nUnder our Constitution the individual, child or adult, can\nfind his own identity, can define her own persona, without\nstate intervention that classifies on the basis of his race or\nthe color of her skin.\n                        *     *     *\n   This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill\nits historic commitment to creating an integrated society\nthat ensures equal opportunity for all of its children. A\ncompelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an\ninterest that a school district, in its discretion and exper\ntise, may choose to pursue. Likewise, a district may con\nsider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student\n\f18    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Race may be one component of that diversity,\nbut other demographic factors, plus special talents and\nneeds, should also be considered. What the government is\nnot permitted to do, absent a showing of necessity not\nmade here, is to classify every student on the basis of race\nand to assign each of them to schools based on that classi\nfication. Crude measures of this sort threaten to reduce\nchildren to racial chits valued and traded according to one\nschool’s supply and another’s demand.\n   That statement, to be sure, invites this response: A\nsense of stigma may already become the fate of those\nseparated out by circumstances beyond their immediate\ncontrol. But to this the replication must be: Even so,\nmeasures other than differential treatment based on racial\ntyping of individuals first must be exhausted.\n   The decision today should not prevent school districts\nfrom continuing the important work of bringing together\nstudents of different racial, ethnic, and economic back\ngrounds. Due to a variety of factors—some influenced by\ngovernment, some not—neighborhoods in our communities\ndo not reflect the diversity of our Nation as a whole.\nThose entrusted with directing our public schools can\nbring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, adminis\ntrators, and other concerned citizens to find a way to\nachieve the compelling interests they face without resort\ning to widespread governmental allocation of benefits and\nburdens on the basis of racial classifications.\n   With this explanation I concur in the judgment of the\nCourt.\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

This distinction is critically important in the context\nof education. While the focus of our opinions is often on the benefits\nthat minority schoolchildren receive from an integrated education, see,\ne.g., ante, at 15 (THOMAS, J., concurring), children of all races benefit\nfrom integrated classrooms and playgrounds, see Wygant, 476 U.

The\nschool board plans before us resemble many others\nadopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary\nschools throughout the Nation. All of those plans repre\nsent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially inte\ngrated education that Brown v. Board of Education, 347\nU. S. 483 (1954), long ago promised—efforts that this\nCourt has repeatedly required, permitted, and encouraged\nlocal authorities to undertake. This Court has recognized\nthat the public interests at stake in such cases are “com\n\f2     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\npelling.” We have approved of “narrowly tailored” plans\nthat are no less race-conscious than the plans before us.\nAnd we have understood that the Constitution permits\nlocal communities to adopt desegregation plans even\nwhere it does not require them to do so.\n  The plurality pays inadequate attention to this law, to\npast opinions’ rationales, their language, and the contexts\nin which they arise. As a result, it reverses course and\nreaches the wrong conclusion. In doing so, it distorts\nprecedent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional princi\nples, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by\nstate and local governments to deal effectively with the\ngrowing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to\nsubstitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-\nrelated litigation, and it undermines Brown’s promise of\nintegrated primary and secondary education that local\ncommunities have sought to make a reality. This cannot\nbe justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.\n                             I\n                           Facts\n   The historical and factual context in which these cases\narise is critical. In Brown, this Court held that the gov\nernment’s segregation of schoolchildren by race violates\nthe Constitution’s promise of equal protection. The Court\nemphasized that “education is perhaps the most important\nfunction of state and local governments.” 347 U. S., at\n493. And it thereby set the Nation on a path toward pub\nlic school integration.\n   In dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school\ndistricts previously segregated by law what they must do\nat a minimum to comply with Brown’s constitutional\nholding. The measures required by those cases often\nincluded race-conscious practices, such as mandatory\nbusing and race-based restrictions on voluntary transfers.\nSee, e.g., Columbus Bd. of Ed. v. Penick, 443 U. S. 449,\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           3\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n455, n. 3 (1979); Davis v.

S. 430, 441–442 (1968).\n   Beyond those minimum requirements, the Court left\nmuch of the determination of how to achieve integration to\nthe judgment of local communities. Thus, in respect to\nrace-conscious desegregation measures that the Constitu\ntion permitted, but did not require (measures similar to\nthose at issue here), this Court unanimously stated:\n    “School authorities are traditionally charged with\n    broad power to formulate and implement educational\n    policy and might well conclude, for example, that in\n    order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic soci\n    ety each school should have a prescribed ratio of Ne\n    gro to white students reflecting the proportion for the\n    district as a whole. To do this as an educational pol\n    icy is within the broad discretionary powers of school\n    authorities.” Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of\n    Ed., 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971) (emphasis added).\n   As a result, different districts—some acting under court\ndecree, some acting in order to avoid threatened lawsuits,\nsome seeking to comply with federal administrative or\nders, some acting purely voluntarily, some acting after\nfederal courts had dissolved earlier orders—adopted,\nmodified, and experimented with hosts of different kinds\nof plans, including race-conscious plans, all with a similar\nobjective: greater racial integration of public schools. See\nF. Welch & A. Light, New Evidence on School Desegrega\ntion v (1987) (hereinafter Welch) (prepared for the Com\nmission on Civil Rights) (reviewing a sample of 125 school\ndistricts, constituting 20% of national public school en\nrollment, that had experimented with nearly 300 different\nplans over 18 years). The techniques that different dis\ntricts have employed range “from voluntary transfer pro\ngrams to mandatory reassignment.” Id., at 21.

NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ndesign of particular plans has been “dictated by both the\nlaw and the specific needs of the district.” Ibid.\n  Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial\nintegration. More recently, however, progress has stalled.\nBetween 1968 and 1980, the number of black children\nattending a school where minority children constituted\nmore than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the\nNation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed\ndirection by the year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the\nNation (from 57% to 69% in the South). Similarly, be\ntween 1968 and 1980, the number of black children at\ntending schools that were more than 90% minority fell\nfrom 64% to 33% in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the\nSouth), but that too reversed direction, rising by the year\n2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from 23% to 31% in\nthe South). As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or\nover 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools\nwith a white population of less than 1%. Of these, 2.3\nmillion were black and Latino students, and only 72,000\nwere white. Today, more than one in six black children\nattend a school that is 99–100% minority. See Appendix\nA, infra. In light of the evident risk of a return to school\nsystems that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated,\nmany school districts have felt a need to maintain or to\nextend their integration efforts.\n  The upshot is that myriad school districts operating in\nmyriad circumstances have devised myriad plans, often\nwith race-conscious elements, all for the sake of eradicat\ning earlier school segregation, bringing about integration,\nor preventing retrogression. Seattle and Louisville are\ntwo such districts, and the histories of their present plans\nset forth typical school integration stories.\n  I describe those histories at length in order to highlight\nthree important features of these cases. First, the school\ndistricts’ plans serve “compelling interests” and are “nar\nrowly tailored” on any reasonable definition of those\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            5\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nterms. Second, the distinction between de jure segregation\n(caused by school systems) and de facto segregation\n(caused, e.g., by housing patterns or generalized societal\ndiscrimination) is meaningless in the present context,\nthereby dooming the plurality’s endeavor to find support\nfor its views in that distinction. Third, real-world efforts\nto substitute racially diverse for racially segregated\nschools (however caused) are complex, to the point where\nthe Constitution cannot plausibly be interpreted to rule\nout categorically all local efforts to use means that are\n“conscious” of the race of individuals.\n   In both Seattle and Louisville, the local school districts\nbegan with schools that were highly segregated in fact. In\nboth cities plaintiffs filed lawsuits claiming unconstitu\ntional segregation. In Louisville, a federal district court\nfound that school segregation reflected pre-Brown state\nlaws separating the races. In Seattle, the plaintiffs al\nleged that school segregation unconstitutionally reflected\nnot only generalized societal discrimination and residen\ntial housing patterns, but also school board policies and\nactions that had helped to create, maintain, and aggravate\nracial segregation. In Louisville, a federal court entered a\nremedial decree. In Seattle, the parties settled after the\nschool district pledged to undertake a desegregation plan.\nIn both cities, the school boards adopted plans designed to\nachieve integration by bringing about more racially di\nverse schools. In each city the school board modified its\nplan several times in light of, for example, hostility to\nbusing, the threat of resegregation, and the desirability of\nintroducing greater student choice. And in each city, the\nschool boards’ plans have evolved over time in ways that\nprogressively diminish the plans’ use of explicit race-\nconscious criteria.\n   The histories that follow set forth these basic facts.\nThey are based upon numerous sources, which for ease of\nexposition I have cataloged, along with their correspond\n\f6      PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

During and just after\nWorld War II, significant numbers of black Americans\nbegan to make Seattle their home. Few black residents\nlived outside the central section of the city. Most worked\nat unskilled jobs. Although black students made up about\n3% of the total Seattle population in the mid-1950’s,\nnearly all black children attended schools where a major\nity of the population was minority. Elementary schools in\ncentral Seattle were between 60% and 80% black; Gar\nfield, the central district high school, was more than 50%\nminority; schools outside the central and southeastern\nsections of Seattle were virtually all white.\n   2. Preliminary Challenges, 1956 to 1969. In 1956, a\nmemo for the Seattle School Board reported that school\nsegregation reflected not only segregated housing patterns\nbut also school board policies that permitted white stu\ndents to transfer out of black schools while restricting the\ntransfer of black students into white schools. In 1958,\nblack parents whose children attended Harrison Elemen\ntary School (with a black student population of over 75%)\nwrote the Seattle board, complaining that the “ ‘boundaries\nfor the Harrison Elementary School were not set in accor\ndance with the long-established standards of the School\nDistrict . . . but were arbitrarily set with an end to exclud\ning colored children from McGilvra School, which is adja\ncent to the Harrison school district.’ ”\n   In 1963, at the insistence of the National Association for\nthe Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other\ncommunity groups, the school board adopted a new race-\nbased transfer policy. The new policy added an explicitly\nracial criterion: If a place exists in a school, then, irrespec\ntive of other transfer criteria, a white student may trans\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

In 1969, about\n2,200 (of 10,383 total) of the district’s black students and\nabout 400 of the district’s white students took advantage\nof the plan. For the next decade, annual program trans\nfers remained at approximately this level.\n   3. The NAACP’s First Legal Challenge and Seattle’s\nResponse, 1969 to 1977. In 1969 the NAACP filed a fed\neral lawsuit against the school board, claiming that the\nboard had “unlawfully and unconstitutionally” “estab\nlish[ed]” and “maintain[ed]” a system of “racially segre\ngated public schools.” The complaint said that 77% of\nblack public elementary school students in Seattle at\ntended 9 of the city’s 86 elementary schools and that 23 of\nthe remaining schools had no black students at all. Simi\nlarly, of the 1,461 black students enrolled in the 12 senior\nhigh schools in Seattle, 1,151 (or 78.8%) attended 3 senior\nhigh schools, and 900 (61.6%) attended a single school,\nGarfield.\n   The complaint charged that the school board had\nbrought about this segregated system in part by “mak[ing]\nand enforc[ing]” certain “rules and regulations,” in part by\n“drawing . . . boundary lines” and “executing school atten\ndance policies” that would create and maintain “predomi\nnantly Negro or non-white schools,” and in part by build\ning schools “in such a manner as to restrict the Negro\nplaintiffs and the class they represent to predominantly\nnegro or non-white schools.” The complaint also charged\nthat the board discriminated in assigning teachers.\n   The board responded to the lawsuit by introducing a\nplan that required race-based transfers and mandatory\nbusing. The plan created three new middle schools at\n\f8     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

It then created a “mixed” student body by assigning\nto those schools students who would otherwise attend\npredominantly white, or predominantly black, schools\nelsewhere. It used explicitly racial criteria in making\nthese assignments (i.e., it deliberately assigned to the new\nmiddle schools black students, not white students, from\nthe black schools and white students, not black students,\nfrom the white schools). And it used busing to transport\nthe students to their new assignments. The plan provoked\nconsiderable local opposition. Opponents brought a law\nsuit. But eventually a state court found that the manda\ntory busing was lawful.\n  In 1976–1977, the plan involved the busing of about 500\nmiddle school students (300 black students and 200 white\nstudents). Another 1,200 black students and 400 white\nstudents participated in the previously adopted voluntary\ntransfer program. Thus about 2,000 students out of a\ntotal district population of about 60,000 students were\ninvolved in one or the other transfer program. At that\ntime, about 20% or 12,000 of the district’s students were\nblack. And the board continued to describe 26 of its 112\nschools as “segregated.”\n  4. The NAACP’s Second Legal Challenge, 1977. In\n1977, the NAACP filed another legal complaint, this time\nwith the federal Department of Health, Education, and\nWelfare’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint\nalleged that the Seattle School Board had created or per\npetuated unlawful racial segregation through, e.g., certain\nschool-transfer criteria, a construction program that need\nlessly built new schools in white areas, district line-\ndrawing criteria, the maintenance of inferior facilities at\nblack schools, the use of explicit racial criteria in the\nassignment of teachers and other staff, and a general\npattern of delay in respect to the implementation of prom\nised desegregation efforts.\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           9\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   The OCR and the school board entered into a formal\nsettlement agreement. The agreement required the board\nto implement what became known as the “Seattle Plan.”\n   5. The Seattle Plan: Mandatory Busing, 1978 to 1988.\nThe board began to implement the Seattle Plan in 1978.\nThis plan labeled “racially imbalanced” any school at\nwhich the percentage of black students exceeded by more\nthan 20% the minority population of the school district as\na whole. It applied that label to 26 schools, including 4\nhigh schools—Cleveland (72.8% minority), Franklin\n(76.6% minority), Garfield (78.4% minority), and Rainier\nBeach (58.9% minority). The plan paired (or “triaded”)\n“imbalanced” black schools with “imbalanced” white\nschools. It then placed some grades (say, third and fourth\ngrades) at one school building and other grades (say, fifth\nand sixth grades) at the other school building. And it\nthereby required, for example, all fourth grade students\nfrom the previously black and previously white schools\nfirst to attend together what would now be a “mixed”\nfourth grade at one of the school buildings and then the\nnext year to attend what would now be a “mixed” fifth\ngrade at the other school building.\n   At the same time, the plan provided that a previous\n“black” school would remain about 50% black, while a\nprevious “white” school would remain about two-thirds\nwhite. It was consequently necessary to decide with some\ncare which students would attend the new “mixed” grade.\nFor this purpose, administrators cataloged the racial\nmakeup of each neighborhood housing block. The school\ndistrict met its percentage goals by assigning to the new\n“mixed” school an appropriate number of “black” housing\nblocks and “white” housing blocks. At the same time,\ntransport from house to school involved extensive busing,\nwith about half of all students attending a school other\nthan the one closest to their home.\n   The Seattle Plan achieved the school integration that it\n\f10    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsought. Just prior to the plan’s implementation, for ex\nample, 4 of Seattle’s 11 high schools were “imbalanced,”\ni.e., almost exclusively “black” or almost exclusively\n“white.” By 1979, only two were out of “balance.” By 1980\nonly Cleveland remained out of “balance” (as the board\ndefined it) and that by a mere two students.\n   Nonetheless, the Seattle Plan, due to its busing, pro\nvoked serious opposition within the State. See generally\nWashington v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457,\n461–466 (1982). Thus, Washington state voters enacted\nan initiative that amended state law to require students to\nbe assigned to the schools closest to their homes. Id., at\n462. The Seattle School Board challenged the constitu\ntionality of the initiative. Id., at 464. This Court then\nheld that the initiative—which would have prevented the\nSeattle Plan from taking effect—violated the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Id., at 470.\n   6. Student Choice, 1988 to 1998. By 1988, many white\nfamilies had left the school district, and many Asian fami\nlies had moved in. The public school population had fallen\nfrom about 100,000 to less than 50,000. The racial\nmakeup of the school population amounted to 43% white,\n24% black, and 23% Asian or Pacific Islander, with His\npanics and Native Americans making up the rest. The\ncost of busing, the harm that members of all racial com\nmunities feared that the Seattle Plan caused, the desire to\nattract white families back to the public schools, and the\ninterest in providing greater school choice led the board to\nabandon busing and to substitute a new student assign\nment policy that resembles the plan now before us.\n   The new plan permitted each student to choose the\nschool he or she wished to attend, subject to race-based\nconstraints. In respect to high schools, for example, a\nstudent was given a list of a subset of schools, carefully\nselected by the board to balance racial distribution in the\ndistrict by including neighborhood schools and schools in\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           11\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nracially different neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. The\nstudent could then choose among those schools, indicating\na first choice, and other choices the student found accept\nable. In making an assignment to a particular high\nschool, the district would give first preference to a student\nwith a sibling already at the school. It gave second prefer\nence to a student whose race differed from a race that was\n“over-represented” at the school (i.e., a race that accounted\nfor a higher percentage of the school population than of\nthe total district population). It gave third preference to\nstudents residing in the neighborhood. It gave fourth\npreference to students who received child care in the\nneighborhood. In a typical year, say, 1995, about 20,000\npotential high school students participated. About 68%\nreceived their first choice. Another 16% received an “ac\nceptable” choice. A further 16% were assigned to a school\nthey had not listed.\n  7. The Current Plan, 1999 to the Present. In 1996, the\nschool board adopted the present plan, which began in\n1999. In doing so, it sought to deemphasize the use of\nracial criteria and to increase the likelihood that a student\nwould receive an assignment at his first or second choice\nhigh school. The district retained a racial tiebreaker for\noversubscribed schools, which takes effect only if the\nschool’s minority or majority enrollment falls outside of a\n30% range centered on the minority/majority population\nratio within the district. At the same time, all students\nwere free subsequently to transfer from the school at\nwhich they were initially placed to a different school of\ntheir choice without regard to race. Thus, at worst, a\nstudent would have to spend one year at a high school he\ndid not pick as a first or second choice.\n  The new plan worked roughly as expected for the two\nschool years during which it was in effect (1999–2000 and\n2000–2001). In the 2000–2001 school year, for example,\nwith the racial tiebreaker, the entering ninth grade class\n\f12    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

(We\nconsider only the ninth grade since only students entering\nthat class were subject to the tiebreaker, and because the\nplan was not in place long enough to change the composi\ntion of an entire school.) In the year 2005–2006, by which\ntime the racial tiebreaker had not been used for several\nyears, Franklin’s overall minority enrollment had risen to\n90%. During the period the tiebreaker applied, it typically\naffected about 300 students per year. Between 80% and\n90% of all students received their first choice assignment;\nbetween 89% and 97% received their first or second choice\nassignment.\n   Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools\nobjected to Seattle’s most recent plan under the State and\nFederal Constitutions. In due course, the Washington\nSupreme Court, the Federal District Court, and the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (sitting en banc) rejected\nthe challenge and found Seattle’s plan lawful.\n                             B\n                         Louisville\n  1. Before the Lawsuit, 1954 to 1972. In 1956, two years\nafter Brown made clear that Kentucky could no longer\nrequire racial segregation by law, the Louisville Board of\nEducation created a geography-based student assignment\nplan designed to help achieve school integration. At the\nsame time it adopted an open transfer policy under which\napproximately 3,000 of Louisville’s 46,000 students ap\nplied for transfer. By 1972, however, the Louisville School\nDistrict remained highly segregated. Approximately half\nthe district’s public school enrollment was black; about\nhalf was white. Fourteen of the district’s nineteen non-\nvocational middle and high schools were close to totally\nblack or totally white. Nineteen of the district’s forty-six\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           13\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nelementary schools were between 80% and 100% black.\nTwenty-one elementary schools were between roughly 90%\nand 100% white.\n   2. Court-Imposed Guidelines and Busing, 1972 to 1991.\nIn 1972, civil rights groups and parents, claiming uncon\nstitutional segregation, sued the Louisville Board of Edu\ncation in federal court. The original litigation eventually\nbecame a lawsuit against the Jefferson County School\nSystem, which in April 1975 absorbed Louisville’s schools\nand combined them with those of the surrounding sub\nurbs. (For ease of exposition, I shall still use “Louisville”\nto refer to what is now the combined districts.) After\npreliminary rulings and an eventual victory for the plain\ntiffs in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the\nDistrict Court in July 1975 entered an order requiring\ndesegregation.\n   The order’s requirements reflected a (newly enlarged)\nschool district student population of about 135,000, ap\nproximately 20% of whom were black. The order required\nthe school board to create and to maintain schools with\nstudent populations that ranged, for elementary schools,\nbetween 12% and 40% black, and for secondary schools\n(with one exception), between 12.5% and 35% black.\n   The District Court also adopted a complex desegregation\nplan designed to achieve the order’s targets. The plan\nrequired redrawing school attendance zones, closing 12\nschools, and busing groups of students, selected by race\nand the first letter of their last names, to schools outside\ntheir immediate neighborhoods. The plan’s initial busing\nrequirements were extensive, involving the busing of\n23,000 students and a transportation fleet that had to\n“operate from early in the morning until late in the eve\nning.” For typical students, the plan meant busing for\nseveral years (several more years for typical black stu\ndents than for typical white students).

Wilkinson, From Brown to Bakke: The Supreme Court\nand School Integration 1954–1978, p. 176 (1979)).\n   The District Court monitored implementation of the\nplan. In 1978, it found that the plan had brought all of\nLouisville’s schools within its “ ‘guidelines’ for racial com\nposition” for “at least a substantial portion of the [previ\nous] three years.” It removed the case from its active\ndocket while stating that it expected the board “to con\ntinue to implement those portions of the desegregation\norder which are by their nature of a continuing effect.”\n   By 1984, after several schools had fallen out of compli\nance with the order’s racial percentages due to shifting\ndemographics in the community, the school board revised\nits desegregation plan. In doing so, the board created a\nnew racial “guideline,” namely a “floating range of 10%\nabove and 10% below the countywide average for the\ndifferent grade levels.” The board simultaneously redrew\ndistrict boundaries so that middle school students could\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          15\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nattend the same school for three years and high school\nstudents for four years. It added “magnet” programs at\ntwo high schools. And it adjusted its alphabet-based\nsystem for grouping and busing students. The board\nestimated that its new plan would lead to annual reas\nsignment (with busing) of about 8,500 black students and\nabout 8,000 white students.\n   3. Student Choice and Project Renaissance, 1991 to\n1996. By 1991, the board had concluded that assigning\nelementary school students to two or more schools during\ntheir elementary school years had proved educationally\nunsound and, if continued, would undermine Kentucky’s\nnewly adopted Education Reform Act. It consequently\nconducted a nearly year-long review of its plan. In doing\nso, it consulted widely with parents and other members of\nthe local community, using public presentations, public\nmeetings, and various other methods to obtain the public’s\ninput. At the conclusion of this review, the board adopted\na new plan, called “Project Renaissance,” that emphasized\nstudent choice.\n   Project Renaissance again revised the board’s racial\nguidelines. It provided that each elementary school would\nhave a black student population of between 15% and 50%;\neach middle and high school would have a black popula\ntion and a white population that fell within a range, the\nboundaries of which were set at 15% above and 15% below\nthe general student population percentages in the county\nat that grade level. The plan then drew new geographical\nschool assignment zones designed to satisfy these guide\nlines; the district could reassign students if particular\nschools failed to meet the guidelines and was required to\ndo so if a school repeatedly missed these targets.\n   In respect to elementary schools, the plan first drew a\nneighborhood line around each elementary school, and it\nthen drew a second line around groups of elementary\nschools (called “clusters”). It initially assigned each stu\n\f16     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Students could also apply to\nattend magnet elementary schools or programs.\n   The plan required each middle school student to be\nassigned to his or her neighborhood school unless the\nstudent applied for, and was accepted by, a magnet middle\nschool. The plan provided for “open” high school enroll\nment. Every 9th or 10th grader could apply to any high\nschool in the system, and the high school would accept\napplicants according to set criteria—one of which con\nsisted of the need to attain or remain in compliance with\nthe plan’s racial guidelines. Finally, the plan created two\nnew magnet schools, one each at the elementary and\nmiddle school levels.\n   4. The Current Plan: Project Renaissance Modified,\n1996 to 2003. In 1995 and 1996, the Louisville School\nBoard, with the help of a special “Planning Team,” com\nmunity meetings, and other official and unofficial study\ngroups, monitored the effects of Project Renaissance and\nconsidered proposals for improvement. Consequently, in\n1996, the board modified Project Renaissance, thereby\ncreating the present plan.\n   At the time, the district’s public school population was\napproximately 30% black. The plan consequently redrew\nthe racial “guidelines,” setting the boundaries at 15% to\n50% black for all schools. It again redrew school assign\nment boundaries. And it expanded the transfer opportuni\nties available to elementary and middle school pupils. The\nplan forbade transfers, however, if the transfer would lead\nto a school population outside the guideline range, i.e., if it\nwould create a school where fewer than 15% or more than\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           17\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n50% of the students were black.\n   The plan also established “Parent Assistance Centers”\nto help parents and students navigate the school selection\nand assignment process. It pledged the use of other re\nsources in order to “encourage all schools to achieve an\nAfrican-American enrollment equivalent to the average\ndistrict-wide African-American enrollment at the school’s\nrespective elementary, middle or high school level.” And\nthe plan continued use of magnet schools.\n   In 1999, several parents brought a lawsuit in federal\ncourt attacking the plan’s use of racial guidelines at one of\nthe district’s magnet schools. They asked the court to\ndissolve the desegregation order and to hold the use of\nmagnet school racial guidelines unconstitutional. The\nboard opposed dissolution, arguing that “the old dual\nsystem” had left a “demographic imbalance” that “pre\nvent[ed] dissolution.” In 2000, after reviewing the present\nplan, the District Court dissolved the 1975 order. It wrote\nthat there was “overwhelming evidence of the Board’s good\nfaith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its\nunderlying purposes.” It added that the Louisville School\nBoard had “treated the ideal of an integrated system as\nmuch more than a legal obligation—they consider it a\npositive, desirable policy and an essential element of any\nwell-rounded public school education.”\n   The Court also found that the magnet programs avail\nable at the high school in question were “not available at\nother high schools” in the school district. It consequently\nheld unconstitutional the use of race-based “targets” to\ngovern admission to magnet schools. And it ordered the\nboard not to control access to those scarce programs\nthrough the use of racial targets.\n   5. The Current Lawsuit, 2003 to the Present. Subse\nquent to the District Court’s dissolution of the desegrega\ntion order (in 2000) the board simply continued to imple\nment its 1996 plan as modified to reflect the court’s\n\f18    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nmagnet school determination. In 2003, the petitioner now\nbefore us, Crystal Meredith, brought this lawsuit challeng\ning the plan’s unmodified portions, i.e., those portions that\ndealt with ordinary, not magnet, schools. Both the Dis\ntrict Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit\nrejected Meredith’s challenge and held the unmodified\naspects of the plan constitutional.\n                               C\n   The histories I have set forth describe the extensive and\nongoing efforts of two school districts to bring about\ngreater racial integration of their public schools. In both\ncases the efforts were in part remedial. Louisville began\nits integration efforts in earnest when a federal court in\n1975 entered a school desegregation order. Seattle under\ntook its integration efforts in response to the filing of a\nfederal lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segre\ngation complaint filed with the federal OCR.\n   The plans in both Louisville and Seattle grow out of\nthese earlier remedial efforts. Both districts faced prob\nlems that reflected initial periods of severe racial segrega\ntion, followed by such remedial efforts as busing, followed\nby evidence of resegregation, followed by a need to end\nbusing and encourage the return of, e.g., suburban stu\ndents through increased student choice. When formulat\ning the plans under review, both districts drew upon their\nconsiderable experience with earlier plans, having revised\ntheir policies periodically in light of that experience. Both\ndistricts rethought their methods over time and explored a\nwide range of other means, including non-race-conscious\npolicies. Both districts also considered elaborate studies\nand consulted widely within their communities.\n   Both districts sought greater racial integration for\neducational and democratic, as well as for remedial, rea\nsons. Both sought to achieve these objectives while pre\nserving their commitment to other educational goals, e.g.,\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          19\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ndistrictwide commitment to high quality public schools,\nincreased pupil assignment to neighborhood schools,\ndiminished use of busing, greater student choice, reduced\nrisk of white flight, and so forth. Consequently, the pre\nsent plans expand student choice; they limit the burdens\n(including busing) that earlier plans had imposed upon\nstudents and their families; and they use race-conscious\ncriteria in limited and gradually diminishing ways. In\nparticular, they use race-conscious criteria only to mark\nthe outer bounds of broad population-related ranges.\n   The histories also make clear the futility of looking\nsimply to whether earlier school segregation was de jure or\nde facto in order to draw firm lines separating the consti\ntutionally permissible from the constitutionally forbidden\nuse of “race-conscious” criteria. JUSTICE THOMAS suggests\nthat it will be easy to identify de jure segregation because\n“[i]n most cases, there either will or will not have been a\nstate constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordi\nnance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring\nseparation of the races.” Ante, at 6, n. 4 (concurring opin\nion). But our precedent has recognized that de jure dis\ncrimination can be present even in the absence of racially\nexplicit laws. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356, 373–\n374 (1886).\n   No one here disputes that Louisville’s segregation was\nde jure. But what about Seattle’s? Was it de facto? De\njure? A mixture? Opinions differed. Or is it that a prior\nfederal court had not adjudicated the matter? Does that\nmake a difference? Is Seattle free on remand to say that\nits schools were de jure segregated, just as in 1956 a memo\nfor the School Board admitted? The plurality does not\nseem confident as to the answer. Compare ante, at 12\n(opinion of the Court) (“[T]he Seattle public schools have\nnever shown that they were ever segregated by law” (em\nphasis added)), with ante at 29–30 (plurality opinion)\n(assuming “the Seattle school district was never segre\n\f20    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

After all, a number of school districts in\nthe South that the Government or private plaintiffs\nchallenged as segregated by law voluntarily desegregated\ntheir schools without a court order—just as Seattle did.\nSee, e.g., Coleman, Desegregation of the Public Schools\nin Kentucky—The Second Year After the Supreme\nCourt’s Decision, 25 J. Negro Educ. 254, 256, 261 (1956)\n(40 of Kentucky’s 180 school districts began desegre\ngation without court orders); Branton, Little Rock\nRevisited: Desegregation to Resegregation, 52 J.

How could such a plan be lawful the day\nbefore dissolution but then become unlawful the very next\nday? On what legal ground can the majority rest its con\ntrary view?

See id.,\nat 12, 29–30. This Court has previously done just the\nopposite, permitting a race-conscious remedy without any\nkind of court decree. See McDaniel, supra, at 41. Because\nthe Constitution emphatically does not forbid the use of\nrace-conscious measures by districts in the South that\nvoluntarily desegregated their schools, on what basis does\nthe plurality claim that the law forbids Seattle to do the\nsame? But see ante, at 29.\n  The histories also indicate the complexity of the tasks\nand the practical difficulties that local school boards face\nwhen they seek to achieve greater racial integration. The\nboards work in communities where demographic patterns\nchange, where they must meet traditional learning goals,\nwhere they must attract and retain effective teachers,\nwhere they should (and will) take account of parents’\nviews and maintain their commitment to public school\neducation, where they must adapt to court intervention,\nwhere they must encourage voluntary student and parent\naction—where they will find that their own good faith,\ntheir knowledge, and their understanding of local circum\nstances are always necessary but often insufficient to solve\nthe problems at hand.\n  These facts and circumstances help explain why in this\ncontext, as to means, the law often leaves legislatures, city\ncouncils, school boards, and voters with a broad range of\nchoice, thereby giving “different communities” the oppor\ntunity to “try different solutions to common problems and\ngravitate toward those that prove most successful or seem\nto them best to suit their individual needs.” Comfort v.\nLynn School Comm., 418 F. 3d 1, 28 (CA1 2005) (Boudin,\nC.

NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n  With this factual background in mind, I turn to the legal\nquestion: Does the United States Constitution prohibit\nthese school boards from using race-conscious criteria in\nthe limited ways at issue here?\n                               II\n                     The Legal Standard\n  A longstanding and unbroken line of legal authority\ntells us that the Equal Protection Clause permits local\nschool boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve\npositive race-related goals, even when the Constitution\ndoes not compel it. Because of its importance, I shall\nrepeat what this Court said about the matter in Swann.\nChief Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a\ncase of exceptional importance, wrote:\n        “School authorities are traditionally charged with\n     broad power to formulate and implement educational\n     policy and might well conclude, for example, that in\n     order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic soci\n     ety each school should have a prescribed ratio of Ne\n     gro to white students reflecting the proportion for the\n     district as a whole. To do this as an educational policy\n     is within the broad discretionary powers of school au\n     thorities.” 402 U. S., at 16.\nThe statement was not a technical holding in the case.\nBut the Court set forth in Swann a basic principle of\nconstitutional law—a principle of law that has found “wide\nacceptance in the legal culture.” Dickerson v. United\nStates, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); Mitchell v. United States, 526 U. S. 314,\n330 (1999); id., at 331, 332 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing\n“ ‘wide acceptance in the legal culture’ ” as “adequate rea\nson not to overrule” prior cases).\n   Thus, in North Carolina Bd. of Ed. v. Swann, 402 U. S.\n43, 45 (1971), this Court, citing Swann, restated the point.\n“[S]chool authorities,” the Court said, “have wide discre\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

Los\nAngeles Bd. of Ed., 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978) (opinion in\nchambers), making clear that he too believed that Swann’s\nstatement reflected settled law: “While I have the gravest\ndoubts that [a state supreme court] was required by the\nUnited States Constitution to take the [desegregation]\naction that it has taken in this case, I have very little\ndoubt that it was permitted by that Constitution to take\nsuch action.” (Emphasis in original.)\n   These statements nowhere suggest that this freedom is\nlimited to school districts where court-ordered desegrega\ntion measures are also in effect. Indeed, in McDaniel, a\ncase decided the same day as Swann, a group of parents\nchallenged a race-conscious student assignment plan that\nthe Clarke County School Board had voluntarily adopted\nas a remedy without a court order (though under federal\nagency pressure—pressure Seattle also encountered). The\nplan required that each elementary school in the district\nmaintain 20% to 40% enrollment of African-American\nstudents, corresponding to the racial composition of the\ndistrict. See Barresi v. Browne, 226 Ga. 456, 456–459, 175\nS. E. 2d 649, 650–651 (1970). This Court upheld the plan,\nsee McDaniel, 402 U. S., at 41, rejecting the parents’\nargument that “a person may not be included or excluded\nsolely because he is a Negro or because he is white.” Brief\nfor Respondents in McDaniel, O. T. 1970, No. 420, p. 25.\n   Federal authorities had claimed—as the NAACP and\nthe OCR did in Seattle—that Clarke County schools were\nsegregated in law, not just in fact. The plurality’s claim\nthat Seattle was “never segregated by law” is simply not\naccurate. Compare ante, at 29, with supra, at 6–9. The\nplurality could validly claim that no court ever found that\n\f24    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nSeattle schools were segregated in law. But that is also\ntrue of the Clarke County schools in McDaniel. Unless we\nbelieve that the Constitution enforces one legal standard\nfor the South and another for the North, this Court should\ngrant Seattle the permission it granted Clarke County,\nGeorgia. See McDaniel, 402 U. S., at 41 (“[S]teps will\nalmost invariably require that students be assigned ‘dif\nferently because of their race.’ . . . Any other approach\nwould freeze the status quo that is the very target of all\ndesegregation processes.”).\n   This Court has also held that school districts may be\nrequired by federal statute to undertake race-conscious\ndesegregation efforts even when there is no likelihood that\nde jure segregation can be shown. In Board of Ed. of City\nSchool Dist. of New York v. Harris, 444 U. S. 130, 148–149\n(1979), the Court concluded that a federal statute required\nschool districts receiving certain federal funds to remedy\nfaculty segregation, even though in this Court’s view the\nracial disparities in the affected schools were purely de\nfacto and would not have been actionable under the Equal\nProtection Clause. Not even the dissenters thought the\nrace-conscious remedial program posed a constitutional\nproblem. See id., at 152 (opinion of Stewart, J.). See also,\ne.g., Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles, 458 U. S.\n527, 535–536 (1982) (“[S]tate courts of California continue\nto have an obligation under state law to order segregated\nschool districts to use voluntary desegregation techniques,\nwhether or not there has been a finding of intentional\nsegregation. . . . [S]chool districts themselves retain a\nstate-law obligation to take reasonably feasible steps to\ndesegregate, and they remain free to adopt reassignment\nand busing plans to effectuate desegregation” (emphasis\nadded)); School Comm. of Boston v.

Indeed, in 1968, the Illinois Supreme\nCourt rejected an equal protection challenge to a race-\nconscious state law seeking to undo de facto segregation:\n      “To support [their] claim, the defendants heavily\n    rely on three Federal cases, each of which held, no\n    State law being involved, that a local school board\n    does not have an affirmative constitutional duty to act\n    to alleviate racial imbalance in the schools that it did\n    not cause. However, the question as to whether the\n    constitution requires a local school board, or a State,\n    to act to undo de facto school segregation is simply not\n    here concerned. The issue here is whether the consti\n    tution permits, rather than prohibits, voluntary State\n    action aimed toward reducing and eventually elimi\n    nating de facto school segregation.\n      “State laws or administrative policies, directed to\n    ward the reduction and eventual elimination of de\n    facto segregation of children in the schools and racial\n    imbalance, have been approved by every high State\n    court which has considered the issue. Similarly, the\n    Federal courts which have considered the issue . . .\n    have recognized that voluntary programs of local\n    school authorities designed to alleviate de facto segre\n    gation and racial imbalance in the schools are not\n    constitutionally forbidden.” Tometz v.

In this respect, Swann was not a sharp or unex\npected departure from prior rulings; it reflected a consen\nsus that had already emerged among state and lower\nfederal courts.\n  If there were doubts before Swann was decided, they did\nnot survive this Court’s decision. Numerous state and\nfederal courts explicitly relied upon Swann’s guidance for\ndecades to follow. For instance, a Texas appeals court in\n1986 rejected a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to a\nvoluntary integration plan by explaining:\n     “[T]he absence of a court order to desegregate does not\n     mean that a school board cannot exceed minimum re\n     quirements in order to promote school integration.\n     School authorities are traditionally given broad dis\n     cretionary powers to formulate and implement educa\n     tional policy and may properly decide to ensure to\n     their students the value of an integrated school ex\n     perience.” Citizens for Better Ed. v.

Like the Texas\ncourt, the Ninth Circuit relied upon Swann and North\nCarolina Bd. of Ed. to reject the argument that “a race-\nconscious plan is permissible only when there has been a\njudicial finding of de jure segregation.” 610 F. 2d, at 663–\n664. See also, e.g., Darville v. Dade County School Bd.,\n497 F. 2d 1002, 1004–1006 (CA5 1974); State ex rel. Citi\nzens Against Mandatory Bussing v. Brooks, 80 Wash. 2d\n121, 128–129, 492 P. 2d 536, 541–542 (1972) (en banc),\noverruled on other grounds, Cole v.

These decisions illustrate\nwell how lower courts understood and followed Swann’s\nenunciation of the relevant legal principle.\n  Courts are not alone in accepting as constitutionally\nvalid the legal principle that Swann enunciated—i.e., that\nthe government may voluntarily adopt race-conscious\nmeasures to improve conditions of race even when it is not\nunder a constitutional obligation to do so. That principle\nhas been accepted by every branch of government and is\nrooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself.\nThus, Congress has enacted numerous race-conscious\nstatutes that illustrate that principle or rely upon its\nvalidity. See, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §6311(b)(2)(C)(v) (No Child\nLeft Behind Act); §1067 et seq. (authorizing aid to minority\ninstitutions). In fact, without being exhaustive, I have\ncounted 51 federal statutes that use racial classifications.\nI have counted well over 100 state statutes that similarly\nemploy racial classifications. Presidential administrations\nfor the past half-century have used and supported various\nrace-conscious measures. See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 10925,\n26 Fed. Reg. 1977 (1961) (President Kennedy); Exec.\nOrder No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965) (President\n\f28    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

And during the same time, hundreds of\nlocal school districts have adopted student assignment\nplans that use race-conscious criteria. See Welch 83–91.\n   That Swann’s legal statement should find such broad\nacceptance is not surprising. For Swann is predicated\nupon a well-established legal view of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. That view understands the basic objective of\nthose who wrote the Equal Protection Clause as forbidding\npractices that lead to racial exclusion. The Amendment\nsought to bring into American society as full members\nthose whom the Nation had previously held in slavery.\nSee Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1872) (“[N]o\none can fail to be impressed with the one pervading pur\npose found in [all the Reconstruction amendments] . . . we\nmean the freedom of the slave race”); Strauder v. West\nVirginia, 100 U.

Sears, A Utopian\nExperiment in Kentucky: Integration and Social Equality\nat Berea, 1866–1904 (1996) (describing federal funding,\nthrough the Freedman’s Bureau, of race-conscious school\nintegration programs).

Vaughn, Schools for All: The Blacks and Public Educa\ntion in the South, 1865–1877, pp. 111–116 (1974) (same).\nAlthough the Constitution almost always forbids the\nformer, it is significantly more lenient in respect to the\nlatter. See Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U. S. 244, 301 (2003)\n(GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPeña, 515 U. S. 200, 243 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).\n   Sometimes Members of this Court have disagreed about\nthe degree of leniency that the Clause affords to programs\ndesigned to include. See Wygant v. Jackson Board of\nEducation, 476 U. S. 267, 274 (1986); Fullilove v.\nKlutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 507 (1980). But I can find no\ncase in which this Court has followed JUSTICE THOMAS’\n“colorblind” approach. And I have found no case that\notherwise repudiated this constitutional asymmetry be\ntween that which seeks to exclude and that which seeks to\ninclude members of minority races.\n   What does the plurality say in response? First, it seeks\nto distinguish Swann and other similar cases on the\nground that those cases involved remedial plans in re\nsponse to judicial findings of de jure segregation. As\nMcDaniel and Harris show, that is historically untrue.\nSee supra, at 22–24. Many school districts in the South\nadopted segregation remedies (to which Swann clearly\napplies) without any such federal order, see supra, at 19–\n20. See also Kennedy Report. Seattle’s circumstances are\n\f30    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nnot meaningfully different from those in, say, McDaniel,\nwhere this Court approved race-conscious remedies.\nLouisville’s plan was created and initially adopted when a\ncompulsory district court order was in place. And, in any\nevent, the histories of Seattle and Louisville make clear\nthat this distinction—between court-ordered and volun\ntary desegregation—seeks a line that sensibly cannot be\ndrawn.\n  Second, the plurality downplays the importance of\nSwann and related cases by frequently describing their\nrelevant statements as “dicta.” These criticisms, however,\nmiss the main point. Swann did not hide its understand\ning of the law in a corner of an obscure opinion or in a\nfootnote, unread but by experts. It set forth its view\nprominently in an important opinion joined by all nine\nJustices, knowing that it would be read and followed\nthroughout the Nation. The basic problem with the plu\nrality’s technical “dicta”-based response lies in its overly\ntheoretical approach to case law, an approach that empha\nsizes rigid distinctions between holdings and dicta in a\nway that serves to mask the radical nature of today’s\ndecision. Law is not an exercise in mathematical logic.\nAnd statements of a legal rule set forth in a judicial opin\nion do not always divide neatly into “holdings” and “dicta.”\n(Consider the legal “status” of Justice Powell’s separate\nopinion in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265\n(1978).)    The constitutional principle enunciated in\nSwann, reiterated in subsequent cases, and relied upon\nover many years, provides, and has widely been thought to\nprovide, authoritative legal guidance. And if the plurality\nnow chooses to reject that principle, it cannot adequately\njustify its retreat simply by affixing the label “dicta” to\nreasoning with which it disagrees. Rather, it must explain\nto the courts and to the Nation why it would abandon\nguidance set forth many years before, guidance that count\nless others have built upon over time, and which the law\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            31\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nhas continuously embodied.\n   Third, a more important response is the plurality’s\nclaim that later cases—in particular Johnson, Adarand,\nand Grutter—supplanted Swann. See ante, at 11–12, 31–\n32, n. 16, 34–35 (citing Adarand, supra, at 227; Johnson v.\nCalifornia, 543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005); Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U. S. 306, 326 (2003)). The plurality says that cases\nsuch as Swann and the others I have described all “were\ndecided before this Court definitively determined that ‘all\nracial classifications . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing\ncourt under strict scrutiny.’ ” Ante, at 31, n. 16 (quoting\nAdarand, 515 U. S., at 227). This Court in Adarand added\nthat “such classifications are constitutional only if they are\nnarrowly tailored measures that further compelling gov\nernmental interests.” Ibid. And the Court repeated this\nsame statement in Grutter. See 539 U. S., at 326.\n   Several of these cases were significantly more restrictive\nthan Swann in respect to the degree of leniency the Four\nteenth Amendment grants to programs designed to in\nclude people of all races. See, e.g., Adarand, supra; Gratz,\nsupra; Grutter, supra. But that legal circumstance cannot\nmake a critical difference here for two separate reasons.\n   First, no case—not Adarand, Gratz, Grutter, or any\nother—has ever held that the test of “strict scrutiny”\nmeans that all racial classifications—no matter whether\nthey seek to include or exclude—must in practice be\ntreated the same. The Court did not say in Adarand or in\nJohnson or in Grutter that it was overturning Swann or\nits central constitutional principle.\n   Indeed, in its more recent opinions, the Court recognized\nthat the “fundamental purpose” of strict scrutiny review is\nto “take relevant differences” between “fundamentally\ndifferent situations . . . into account.” Adarand, supra, at\n228 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court made\nclear that “[s]trict scrutiny does not trea[t] dissimilar race-\nbased decisions as though they were equally objection\n\f32     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nable.” Ibid. It added that the fact that a law “treats [a\nperson] unequally because of his or her race . . . says\nnothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law.”\nId., at 229–230 (internal quotation marks omitted). And\nthe Court, using the very phrase that Justice Marshall\nhad used to describe strict scrutiny’s application to any\nexclusionary use of racial criteria, sought to “dispel the\nnotion that strict scrutiny” is as likely to condemn inclu\nsive uses of “race-conscious” criteria as it is to invalidate\nexclusionary uses. That is, it is not in all circumstances\n“ ‘strict in theory, but fatal in fact.’ ” Id., at 237 (quoting\nFullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J.,\nconcurring in judgment)).\n    The Court in Grutter elaborated:\n       “Strict scrutiny is not ‘strict in theory, but fatal in\n     fact.’ . . . Although all governmental uses of race\n     are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated\n     by it. . . .\n       “Context matters when reviewing race-based gov\n     ernmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\n     See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343–344\n     (1960) (admonishing that, ‘in dealing with claims un\n     der broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive\n     content by an interpretive process of inclusion and ex\n     clusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on\n     and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise\n     to them, must not be applied out of context in disre\n     gard of variant controlling facts’). . . . Not every deci\n     sion influenced by race is equally objectionable, and\n     strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for\n     carefully examining the importance and the sincerity\n     of the reasons advanced by the governmental deci\n     sionmaker for the use of race in that particular con\n     text.” 539 U. S., at 326–327.\nThe Court’s holding in Grutter demonstrates that the\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           33\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCourt meant what it said, for the Court upheld an elite\nlaw school’s race-conscious admissions program.\n   The upshot is that the cases to which the plurality\nrefers, though all applying strict scrutiny, do not treat\nexclusive and inclusive uses the same. Rather, they apply\nthe strict scrutiny test in a manner that is “fatal in fact”\nonly to racial classifications that harmfully exclude; they\napply the test in a manner that is not fatal in fact to racial\nclassifications that seek to include.\n   The plurality cannot avoid this simple fact. See ante, at\n34–36. Today’s opinion reveals that the plurality would\nrewrite this Court’s prior jurisprudence, at least in practi\ncal application, transforming the “strict scrutiny” test into\na rule that is fatal in fact across the board. In doing so,\nthe plurality parts company from this Court’s prior cases,\nand it takes from local government the longstanding legal\nright to use race-conscious criteria for inclusive purposes\nin limited ways.\n   Second, as Grutter specified, “[c]ontext matters when\nreviewing race-based governmental action under the\nEqual Protection Clause.” 539 U. S., at 327 (citing Gomil\nlion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 343–344 (1960)). And\ncontexts differ dramatically one from the other. Govern\nmental use of race-based criteria can arise in the context\nof, for example, census forms, research expenditures for\ndiseases, assignments of police officers patrolling pre\ndominantly minority-race neighborhoods, efforts to deseg\nregate racially segregated schools, policies that favor\nminorities when distributing goods or services in short\nsupply, actions that create majority-minority electoral\ndistricts, peremptory strikes that remove potential jurors\non the basis of race, and others. Given the significant\ndifferences among these contexts, it would be surprising if\nthe law required an identically strict legal test for evaluat\ning the constitutionality of race-based criteria as to each of\nthem.\n\f34    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n  Here, the context is one in which school districts seek to\nadvance or to maintain racial integration in primary and\nsecondary schools. It is a context, as Swann makes clear,\nwhere history has required special administrative reme\ndies. And it is a context in which the school boards’ plans\nsimply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries of\na broad range.\n  This context is not a context that involves the use of race\nto decide who will receive goods or services that are nor\nmally distributed on the basis of merit and which are in\nshort supply. It is not one in which race-conscious limits\nstigmatize or exclude; the limits at issue do not pit the\nraces against each other or otherwise significantly exacer\nbate racial tensions. They do not impose burdens unfairly\nupon members of one race alone but instead seek benefits\nfor members of all races alike. The context here is one of\nracial limits that seek, not to keep the races apart, but to\nbring them together.\n  The importance of these differences is clear once one\ncompares the present circumstances with other cases\nwhere one or more of these negative features are present.\nSee, e.g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880);\nYick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (1886); Brown, 347\nU. S. 483; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); Regents of\nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265 (1978); Batson v.\nKentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986); Richmond v. J. A. Croson\nCo., 488 U. S. 469 (1989); Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630\n(1993); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U.

S. 499 (2005).\n  If one examines the context more specifically, one finds\nthat the districts’ plans reflect efforts to overcome a his\ntory of segregation, embody the results of broad experience\nand community consultation, seek to expand student\nchoice while reducing the need for mandatory busing, and\nuse race-conscious criteria in highly limited ways that\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

Gittens, 160 F. 3d 790,\n809–810 (CA1 1998) (Boudin, J., concurring), with Com\nfort, 418 F. 3d, at 28–29 (Boudin, C. J., concurring). They\ndo not seek to award a scarce commodity on the basis of\nmerit, for they are not magnet schools; rather, by design\nand in practice, they offer substantially equivalent aca\ndemic programs and electives. Although some parents or\nchildren prefer some schools over others, school popularity\nhas varied significantly over the years. In 2000, for exam\nple, Roosevelt was the most popular first choice high\nschool in Seattle; in 2001, Ballard was the most popular;\nin 2000, West Seattle was one of the least popular; by\n2003, it was one of the more popular. See Research,\nEvaluation and Assessment, Student Information Serv-\nices Office, District Summaries 1999–2005, available at\nhttp: //www.seattleschools.org/area/siso/disprof/2005/DP05\nall.pdf. In a word, the school plans under review do not\ninvolve the kind of race-based harm that has led this\nCourt, in other contexts, to find the use of race-conscious\ncriteria unconstitutional.\n   These and related considerations convinced one Ninth\nCircuit judge in the Seattle case to apply a standard of\nconstitutionality review that is less than “strict,” and to\nconclude that this Court’s precedents do not require the\ncontrary. See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193–1194 (2005) (Kozinski,\nJ., concurring) (“That a student is denied the school of his\nchoice may be disappointing, but it carries no racial\nstigma and says nothing at all about that individual’s\naptitude or ability”). That judge is not alone. Cf. Gratz,\nsupra, at 301 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); Adarand, supra,\nat 243 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Carter, When Victims\nHappen To Be Black, 97 Yale L. J. 420, 433–434 (1988).\n   The view that a more lenient standard than “strict\nscrutiny” should apply in the present context would not\nimply abandonment of judicial efforts carefully to deter\n\f36    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nmine the need for race-conscious criteria and the criteria’s\ntailoring in light of the need. And the present context\nrequires a court to examine carefully the race-conscious\nprogram at issue. In doing so, a reviewing judge must be\nfully aware of the potential dangers and pitfalls that\nJUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE KENNEDY mention. See\nante, at 11–12 (THOMAS, J., concurring); ante, at 3, 17\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.).\n   But unlike the plurality, such a judge would also be\naware that a legislature or school administrators, ulti\nmately accountable to the electorate, could nonetheless\nproperly conclude that a racial classification sometimes\nserves a purpose important enough to overcome the risks\nthey mention, for example, helping to end racial isolation\nor to achieve a diverse student body in public schools. Cf.\nante, at 17–18 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Where that is so,\nthe judge would carefully examine the program’s details to\ndetermine whether the use of race-conscious criteria is\nproportionate to the important ends it serves.\n   In my view, this contextual approach to scrutiny is\naltogether fitting. I believe that the law requires applica\ntion here of a standard of review that is not “strict” in the\ntraditional sense of that word, although it does require the\ncareful review I have just described. See Gratz, supra, at\n301 (GINSBURG, J., joined by SOUTER, J., dissenting);\nAdarand, supra, at 242–249 (STEVENS, J., joined by\nGINSBURG, J., dissenting); 426 F. 3d, at 1193–1194 (Koz\ninski, J., concurring). Apparently JUSTICE KENNEDY also\nagrees that strict scrutiny would not apply in respect to\ncertain “race-conscious” school board policies. See ante, at\n9 (“Executive and legislative branches, which for genera\ntions now have considered these types of policies and\nprocedures, should be permitted to employ them with\ncandor and with confidence that a constitutional violation\ndoes not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the\nimpact a given approach might have on students of differ\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

S., at 290 (opinion of Powell, J.), I\nshall adopt the first alternative. I shall apply the version\nof strict scrutiny that those cases embody. I shall conse\nquently ask whether the school boards in Seattle and\nLouisville adopted these plans to serve a “compelling\ngovernmental interest” and, if so, whether the plans are\n“narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest. If the plans\nsurvive this strict review, they would survive less exacting\nreview a fortiori. Hence, I conclude that the plans before\nus pass both parts of the strict scrutiny test. Conse\nquently I must conclude that the plans here are permitted\nunder the Constitution.\n                            III\n               Applying the Legal Standard\n                             A\n                     Compelling Interest\n  The principal interest advanced in these cases to justify\nthe use of race-based criteria goes by various names.\nSometimes a court refers to it as an interest in achieving\nracial “diversity.” Other times a court, like the plurality\nhere, refers to it as an interest in racial “balancing.” I\nhave used more general terms to signify that interest,\ndescribing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or\npreserving greater racial “integration” of public schools.\nBy this term, I mean the school districts’ interest in elimi\nnating school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the\ndegree to which racial mixture characterizes each of the\ndistrict’s schools and each individual student’s public\nschool experience.\n  Regardless of its name, however, the interest at stake\npossesses three essential elements. First, there is a his\ntorical and remedial element: an interest in setting right\nthe consequences of prior conditions of segregation. This\n\f38    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nrefers back to a time when public schools were highly\nsegregated, often as a result of legal or administrative\npolicies that facilitated racial segregation in public\nschools. It is an interest in continuing to combat the\nremnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by\nthese school-related policies, which have often affected not\nonly schools, but also housing patterns, employment prac\ntices, economic conditions, and social attitudes. It is an\ninterest in maintaining hard-won gains. And it has its\nroots in preventing what gradually may become the de\nfacto resegregation of America’s public schools. See Part I,\nsupra, at 4; Appendix A, infra. See also ante, at 17 (opin\nion of KENNEDY, J.) (“This Nation has a moral and ethical\nobligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an\nintegrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of\nits children”).\n   Second, there is an educational element: an interest in\novercoming the adverse educational effects produced by\nand associated with highly segregated schools. Cf. Grut\nter, 539 U. S., at 345 (GINSBURG, J., concurring). Studies\nsuggest that children taken from those schools and placed\nin integrated settings often show positive academic gains.\nSee, e.g., Powell, Living and Learning: Linking Housing\nand Education, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking\nHousing and Education Policy 15, 35 (J. Powell, G. Kear\nney, & V. Kay eds. 2001) (hereinafter Powell); Hallinan,\nDiversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social Science\nEvidence, 59 Ohio St. L. J. 733, 741–742 (1998) (hereinaf\nter Hallinan).\n   Other studies reach different conclusions. See, e.g., D.\nArmor, Forced Justice (1995). See also ante, at 15–17\n(THOMAS, J., concurring). But the evidence supporting an\neducational interest in racially integrated schools is well\nestablished and strong enough to permit a democratically\nelected school board reasonably to determine that this\ninterest is a compelling one.\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)          39\n\n                    BREYER, J., dissenting\n\n   Research suggests, for example, that black children\nfrom segregated educational environments significantly\nincrease their achievement levels once they are placed in a\nmore integrated setting. Indeed in Louisville itself the\nachievement gap between black and white elementary\nschool students grew substantially smaller (by seven\npercentage points) after the integration plan was imple\nmented in 1975. See Powell 35. Conversely, to take an\nother example, evidence from a district in Norfolk, Vir\nginia, shows that resegregated schools led to a decline in\nthe achievement test scores of children of all races. Ibid.\n   One commentator, reviewing dozens of studies of the\neducational benefits of desegregated schooling, found that\nthe studies have provided “remarkably consistent” results,\nshowing that: (1) black students’ educational achievement\nis improved in integrated schools as compared to racially\nisolated schools, (2) black students’ educational achieve\nment is improved in integrated classes, and (3) the earlier\nthat black students are removed from racial isolation, the\nbetter their educational outcomes. See Hallinan 741–742.\nMultiple studies also indicate that black alumni of inte\ngrated schools are more likely to move into occupations\ntraditionally closed to African-Americans, and to earn\nmore money in those fields. See, e.g., Schofield, Review of\nResearch on School Desegregation’s Impact on Elementary\nand Secondary School Students, in Handbook of Research\non Multicultural Education 597, 606–607 (J. Banks & C.\nBanks eds. 1995). Cf. W. Bowen & D. Bok, The Shape of\nthe River 118 (1998) (hereinafter Bowen & Bok).\n   Third, there is a democratic element: an interest in\nproducing an educational environment that reflects the\n“pluralistic society” in which our children will live.\nSwann, 402 U. S., at 16. It is an interest in helping our\nchildren learn to work and play together with children of\ndifferent racial backgrounds. It is an interest in teaching\nchildren to engage in the kind of cooperation among\n\f40    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nAmericans of all races that is necessary to make a land of\nthree hundred million people one Nation.\n   Again, data support this insight. See, e.g., Hallinan 745;\nQuillian & Campbell, Beyond Black and White: The Pre\nsent and Future of Multiracial Friendship Segregation, 68\nAm. Sociological Rev. 540, 541 (2003) (hereinafter Quillian\n& Campbell); Dawkins & Braddock, The Continuing Sig\nnificance of Desegregation: School Racial Composition and\nAfrican American Inclusion in American Society, 63 J.\nNegro Ed. 394, 401–403 (1994) (hereinafter Dawkins &\nBraddock); Wells & Crain, Perpetuation Theory and the\nLong-Term Effects of School Desegregation, 64 Rev. Edu\ncational Research 531, 550 (1994) (hereinafter Wells &\nCrain).\n   There are again studies that offer contrary conclusions.\nSee, e.g., Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup\nRelations, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G.\nGrant ed. 1991). See also ante, at 22–23 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring). Again, however, the evidence supporting a\ndemocratic interest in racially integrated schools is firmly\nestablished and sufficiently strong to permit a school\nboard to determine, as this Court has itself often found,\nthat this interest is compelling.\n   For example, one study documented that “black and\nwhite students in desegregated schools are less racially\nprejudiced than those in segregated schools,” and that\n“interracial contact in desegregated schools leads to an\nincrease in interracial sociability and friendship.” Hal\nlinan 745. See also Quillian & Campbell 541. Cf. Bowen\n& Bok 155. Other studies have found that both black and\nwhite students who attend integrated schools are more\nlikely to work in desegregated companies after graduation\nthan students who attended racially isolated schools.\nDawkins & Braddock 401–403; Wells & Crain 550. Fur\nther research has shown that the desegregation of schools\ncan help bring adult communities together by reducing\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

Cities that have implemented suc\ncessful school desegregation plans have witnessed in\ncreased interracial contact and neighborhoods that tend to\nbecome less racially segregated. Dawkins & Braddock\n403. These effects not only reinforce the prior gains of\nintegrated primary and secondary education; they also\nforesee a time when there is less need to use race-\nconscious criteria.\n   Moreover, this Court from Swann to Grutter has treated\nthese civic effects as an important virtue of racially di\nverse education. See, e.g., Swann, supra, at 16; Seattle\nSchool Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S., at 472–473. In Grutter, in\nthe context of law school admissions, we found that these\ntypes of interests were, constitutionally speaking, “compel\nling.” See 539 U. S., at 330 (recognizing that Michigan\nLaw School’s race-conscious admissions policy “promotes\ncross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial\nstereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand\npersons of different races,” and pointing out that “the\nskills needed in today’s increasingly global marketplace\ncan only be developed through exposure to widely diverse\npeople, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints” (internal quota\ntion marks omitted; alteration in original)).\n   In light of this Court’s conclusions in Grutter, the “com\npelling” nature of these interests in the context of primary\nand secondary public education follows here a fortiori.\nPrimary and secondary schools are where the education of\nthis Nation’s children begins, where each of us begins to\nabsorb those values we carry with us to the end of our\ndays. As Justice Marshall said, “unless our children begin\nto learn together, there is little hope that our people will\never learn to live together.” Milliken v. Bradley, 418 U. S.\n717, 783 (1974) (dissenting opinion).\n   And it was Brown, after all, focusing upon primary and\nsecondary schools, not Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.

Hence, I am not surprised\nthat JUSTICE KENNEDY finds that, “a district may consider\nit a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student popu\nlation,” including a racially diverse population. Ante, at\n17–18.\n   The compelling interest at issue here, then, includes an\neffort to eradicate the remnants, not of general “societal\ndiscrimination,” ante, at 23 (plurality opinion), but of\nprimary and secondary school segregation, see supra, at 7,\n14; it includes an effort to create school environments that\nprovide better educational opportunities for all children; it\nincludes an effort to help create citizens better prepared to\nknow, to understand, and to work with people of all races\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

If an educa\ntional interest that combines these three elements is not\n“compelling,” what is?\n   The majority acknowledges that in prior cases this\nCourt has recognized at least two interests as compelling:\nan interest in “remedying the effects of past intentional\ndiscrimination,” and an interest in “diversity in higher\neducation.” Ante, at 12, 13. But the plurality does not\nconvincingly explain why those interests do not constitute\na “compelling interest” here. How do the remedial inter\nests here differ in kind from those at issue in the volun\ntary desegregation efforts that Attorney General Kennedy\nmany years ago described in his letter to the President?\nSupra, at 19–20. How do the educational and civic inter\nests differ in kind from those that underlie and justify the\nracial “diversity” that the law school sought in Grutter,\nwhere this Court found a compelling interest?\n   The plurality tries to draw a distinction by reference to\nthe well-established conceptual difference between de jure\nsegregation (“segregation by state action”) and de facto\nsegregation (“racial imbalance caused by other factors”).\nAnte, at 28. But that distinction concerns what the Con\nstitution requires school boards to do, not what it permits\nthem to do. Compare, e.g., Green, 391 U. S., at 437–438\n(“School boards . . . operating state-compelled dual sys\ntems” have an “affirmative duty to take whatever steps\nmight be necessary to convert to a unitary system in\nwhich racial discrimination would be eliminated root and\nbranch”), with, e.g., Milliken, 418 U. S., at 745 (the Con\nstitution does not impose a duty to desegregate upon\ndistricts that have not been “shown to have committed any\nconstitutional violation”).\n   The opinions cited by the plurality to justify its reliance\nupon the de jure/de facto distinction only address what\nremedial measures a school district may be constitution\n\f44    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

As to what is permitted, nothing in\nour equal protection law suggests that a State may right\nonly those wrongs that it committed. No case of this Court\nhas ever relied upon the de jure/de facto distinction in\norder to limit what a school district is voluntarily allowed\nto do. That is what is at issue here. And Swann, McDan\niel, Crawford, North Carolina Bd. of Ed., Harris, and\nBustop made one thing clear: significant as the difference\nbetween de jure and de facto segregation may be to the\nquestion of what a school district must do, that distinction\nis not germane to the question of what a school district\nmay do.\n   Nor does any precedent indicate, as the plurality sug\ngests with respect to Louisville, ante, at 29, that remedial\ninterests vanish the day after a federal court declares that\na district is “unitary.” Of course, Louisville adopted those\nportions of the plan at issue here before a court declared\nLouisville “unitary.” Moreover, in Freeman, this Court\npointed out that in “one sense of the term, vestiges of past\nsegregation by state decree do remain in our society and in\nour schools. Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs com\nmitted by the State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of\nhistory. And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.”\n503 U. S., at 495. See also ante, at 15 (opinion of\nKENNEDY, J.). I do not understand why this Court’s cases,\nwhich rest the significance of a “unitary” finding in part\nupon the wisdom and desirability of returning schools to\nlocal control, should deprive those local officials of legal\npermission to use means they once found necessary to\ncombat persisting injustices.\n   For his part, JUSTICE THOMAS faults my citation of\nvarious studies supporting the view that school districts\ncan find compelling educational and civic interests in\nintegrating their public schools.

If we are to insist upon\nunanimity in the social science literature before finding a\ncompelling interest, we might never find one. I believe\nonly that the Constitution allows democratically elected\nschool boards to make up their own minds as to how best\nto include people of all races in one America.\n                              B\n                      Narrow Tailoring\n  I next ask whether the plans before us are “narrowly\ntailored” to achieve these “compelling” objectives. I shall\nnot accept the school board’s assurances on faith, cf. Miller\nv. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 920 (1995), and I shall subject\nthe “tailoring” of their plans to “rigorous judicial review.”\nGrutter, 539 U. S., at 388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting).\nSeveral factors, taken together, nonetheless lead me to\nconclude that the boards’ use of race-conscious criteria in\nthese plans passes even the strictest “tailoring” test.\n  First, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set\nthe outer bounds of broad ranges.           Cf. id., at 390\n(KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (expressing concern about “nar\n\f46    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nrow fluctuation band[s]”). They constitute but one part of\nplans that depend primarily upon other, nonracial ele\nments. To use race in this way is not to set a forbidden\n“quota.” See id., at 335 (“Properly understood, a ‘quota’ is\na program in which a certain fixed number or proportion\nof opportunities are ‘reserved exclusively for certain mi\nnority groups’ ” (quoting Croson, 488 U. S., at 496)).\n  In fact, the defining feature of both plans is greater\nemphasis upon student choice. In Seattle, for example, in\nmore than 80% of all cases, that choice alone determines\nwhich high schools Seattle’s ninth graders will attend.\nAfter ninth grade, students can decide voluntarily to\ntransfer to a preferred district high school (without any\nconsideration of race-conscious criteria). Choice, therefore,\nis the “predominant factor” in these plans. Race is not.\nSee Grutter, supra, at 393 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (al\nlowing consideration of race only if it does “not become a\npredominant factor”).\n  Indeed, the race-conscious ranges at issue in these cases\noften have no effect, either because the particular school is\nnot oversubscribed in the year in question, or because the\nracial makeup of the school falls within the broad range,\nor because the student is a transfer applicant or has a\nsibling at the school. In these respects, the broad ranges\nare less like a quota and more like the kinds of “useful\nstarting points” that this Court has consistently found\npermissible, even when they set boundaries upon volun\ntary transfers, and even when they are based upon a\ncommunity’s general population. See, e.g., North Carolina\nBd. of Ed. v. Swann, 402 U. S. 43, 46 (1971) (no “absolute\nprohibition against [the] use” of mathematical ratios as a\n“starting point”); Swann, 402 U. S., at 24–25 (approving\nthe use of a ratio reflecting “the racial composition of the\nwhole school system” as a “useful starting point,” but not\nas an “inflexible requirement”). Cf. United States v. Mont\ngomery County Bd. of Ed., 395 U. S. 225, 232 (1969) (ap\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           47\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nproving a lower court desegregation order that “provided\nthat the [school] board must move toward a goal under\nwhich ‘in each school the ratio of white to Negro faculty\nmembers is substantially the same as it is throughout the\nsystem,’ ” and “immediately” requiring “[t]he ratio of Negro\nto white teachers” in each school to be equal to “the ratio\nof Negro to white teachers in . . . the system as a whole”).\n   Second, broad-range limits on voluntary school choice\nplans are less burdensome, and hence more narrowly\ntailored, see Grutter, supra, at 341, than other race-\nconscious restrictions this Court has previously approved.\nSee, e.g., Swann, supra, at 26–27; Montgomery Co. Bd. of\nEd., supra, at 232. Indeed, the plans before us are more\nnarrowly tailored than the race-conscious admission plans\nthat this Court approved in Grutter. Here, race becomes a\nfactor only in a fraction of students’ non-merit-based\nassignments—not in large numbers of students’ merit-\nbased applications. Moreover, the effect of applying race-\nconscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged\nstudents less severely, not more severely, than the criteria\nat issue in Grutter. Disappointed students are not rejected\nfrom a State’s flagship graduate program; they simply\nattend a different one of the district’s many public schools,\nwhich in aspiration and in fact are substantially equal.\nCf. Wygant, 476 U. S., at 283. And, in Seattle, the disad\nvantaged student loses at most one year at the high school\nof his choice. One will search Grutter in vain for similarly\npersuasive evidence of narrow tailoring as the school\ndistricts have presented here.\n   Third, the manner in which the school boards developed\nthese plans itself reflects “narrow tailoring.” Each plan\nwas devised to overcome a history of segregated public\nschools. Each plan embodies the results of local experi\nence and community consultation. Each plan is the prod\nuct of a process that has sought to enhance student choice,\nwhile diminishing the need for mandatory busing. And\n\f48    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\neach plan’s use of race-conscious elements is diminished\ncompared to the use of race in preceding integration plans.\n   The school boards’ widespread consultation, their ex\nperimentation with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40\nyear history that Part I sets forth, make clear that plans\nthat are less explicitly race-based are unlikely to achieve\nthe board’s “compelling” objectives. The history of each\nschool system reveals highly segregated schools, followed\nby remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by\nefforts to attract or retain students through the use of\nplans that abandoned busing and replaced it with greater\nstudent choice. Both cities once tried to achieve more\nintegrated schools by relying solely upon measures such as\nredrawn district boundaries, new school building construc\ntion, and unrestricted voluntary transfers. In neither city\ndid these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the\ncity’s integration goals. See Parts I–A and I–B, supra, at\n6–18.\n   Moreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school\nboard’s knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these par\nticular matters is not inconsistent with rigorous judicial\nscrutiny. It simply recognizes that judges are not well\nsuited to act as school administrators. Indeed, in the\ncontext of school desegregation, this Court has repeatedly\nstressed the importance of acknowledging that local school\nboards better understand their own communities and have\na better knowledge of what in practice will best meet the\neducational needs of their pupils. See Milliken, 418 U. S.,\nat 741–42 (“No single tradition in public education is more\ndeeply rooted than local control over the operation of\nschools; local autonomy has long been thought essential\nboth to the maintenance of community concern and sup\nport for public schools and to quality of the educational\nprocess”).

In 1987, the U. S. Commission on\nCivil Rights studied 125 large school districts seeking\nintegration. It reported that most districts—92 of them, in\nfact—adopted desegregation policies that combined two or\nmore highly race-conscious strategies, for example, rezon\ning or pairing. See Welch 83–91.\n   Having looked at dozens of amicus briefs, public reports,\nnews stories, and the records in many of this Court’s prior\ncases, which together span 50 years of desegregation\nhistory in school districts across the Nation, I have discov\nered many examples of districts that sought integration\nthrough explicitly race-conscious methods, including man\ndatory busing. Yet, I have found no example or model that\nwould permit this Court to say to Seattle and to Louisville:\n“Here is an instance of a desegregation plan that is likely\nto achieve your objectives and also makes less use of race-\nconscious criteria than your plans.” And, if the plurality\n\f50     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ncannot suggest such a model—and it cannot—then it seeks\nto impose a “narrow tailoring” requirement that in prac\ntice would never be met.\n   Indeed, if there is no such plan, or if such plans are\npurely imagined, it is understandable why, as the plural\nity notes, ante, at 27, Seattle school officials concentrated\non diminishing the racial component of their districts’\nplan, but did not pursue eliminating that element entirely.\nFor the plurality now to insist as it does, ante, at 27–28,\nthat these school districts ought to have said so officially is\neither to ask for the superfluous (if they need only make\nexplicit what is implicit) or to demand the impossible (if\nthey must somehow provide more proof that there is no\nhypothetical other plan that could work as well as theirs).\nI am not aware of any case in which this Court has read\nthe “narrow tailoring” test to impose such a requirement.\nCf. People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Ed. School Dist.\nNo. 205, 961 F. 2d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.)\n(“Would it be necessary to adjudicate the obvious\nbefore adopting (or permitting the parties to agree on) a\nremedy . . . ?”).\n   The plurality also points to the school districts’ use of\nnumerical goals based upon the racial breakdown of the\ngeneral school population, and it faults the districts for\nfailing to prove that no other set of numbers will work. See\nante, at 18–20. The plurality refers to no case in support\nof its demand. Nor is it likely to find such a case. After\nall, this Court has in many cases explicitly permitted\ndistricts to use target ratios based upon the district’s\nunderlying population. See, e.g., Swann, 402 U. S., at 24–\n25; North Carolina Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S., at 46; Montgom\nery County Bd. of Ed., 395 U. S., at 232. The reason is\nobvious: In Seattle, where the overall student population\nis 41% white, permitting 85% white enrollment at a single\nschool would make it much more likely that other schools\nwould have very few white students, whereas in Jefferson\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           51\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nCounty, with a 60% white enrollment, one school with 85%\nwhite students would be less likely to skew enrollments\nelsewhere.\n  Moreover, there is research-based evidence supporting,\nfor example, that a ratio no greater than 50% minority—\nwhich is Louisville’s starting point, and as close as feasible\nto Seattle’s starting point—is helpful in limiting the risk of\n“white flight.” See Orfield, Metropolitan School Desegre\ngation: Impacts on Metropolitan Society, in Pursuit of a\nDream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy\n121, 125. Federal law also assumes that a similar target\npercentage will help avoid detrimental “minority group\nisolation.” See No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title V,\nPart C, 115 Stat. 1806, 20 U. S. C. §7231 et seq. (2000 ed.,\nSupp. IV); 34 CFR §§280.2, 280.4 (2006) (implementing\nregulations). What other numbers are the boards to use\nas a “starting point”? Are they to spend days, weeks, or\nmonths seeking independently to validate the use of ratios\nthat this Court has repeatedly authorized in prior cases?\nAre they to draw numbers out of thin air? These districts\nhave followed this Court’s holdings and advice in “tailor\ning” their plans. That, too, strongly supports the lawful\nness of their methods.\n  Nor could the school districts have accomplished their\ndesired aims (e.g., avoiding forced busing, countering\nwhite flight, maintaining racial diversity) by other means.\nNothing in the extensive history of desegregation efforts\nover the past 50 years gives the districts, or this Court,\nany reason to believe that another method is possible to\naccomplish these goals. Nevertheless, JUSTICE KENNEDY\nsuggests that school boards:\n    “may pursue the goal of bringing together students of\n    diverse backgrounds and races through other means,\n    including strategic site selection of new schools; draw\n    ing attendance zones with general recognition of the\n\f52     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n     demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources\n     for special programs; recruiting students and faculty\n     in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, per\n     formance, and other statistics by race.” Ante, at 8.\nBut, as to “strategic site selection,” Seattle has built one\nnew high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized\nschool serves only 300 students). In fact, six of the Seattle\nhigh schools involved in this case were built by the 1920’s;\nthe other four were open by the early 1960’s. See gener\nally N. Thompson & C. Marr, Building for Learning: Seat\ntle Public Schools Histories, 1862–2000 (2002). As to\n“drawing” neighborhood “attendance zones” on a racial\nbasis, Louisville tried it, and it worked only when forced\nbusing was also part of the plan. See supra, at 12–14. As\nto “allocating resources for special programs,” Seattle and\nLouisville have both experimented with this; indeed, these\nprograms are often referred to as “magnet schools,” but\nthe limited desegregation effect of these efforts extends at\nmost to those few schools to which additional resources are\ngranted. In addition, there is no evidence from the experi\nence of these school districts that it will make any mean\ningful impact. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05–908, p.\n42. As to “recruiting faculty” on the basis of race, both\ncities have tried, but only as one part of a broader pro\ngram. As to “tracking enrollments, performance and other\nstatistics by race,” tracking reveals the problem; it does\nnot cure it.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY sets forth two additional concerns\nrelated to “narrow tailoring.” In respect to Louisville, he\nsays first that officials stated (1) that kindergarten as\nsignments are not subject to the race-conscious guidelines,\nand (2) that the child at issue here was denied permission\nto attend the kindergarten he wanted because of those\nguidelines. Both, he explains, cannot be true. He adds\nthat this confusion illustrates that Louisville’s assignment\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            53\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nplan (or its explanation of it to this Court) is insufficiently\nprecise in respect to “who makes the decisions,” “over\nsight,” “the precise circumstances in which an assignment\ndecision” will be made; and “which of two similarly situ\nated children will be subjected to a given race-based deci\nsion.” Ante, at 4.\n   The record suggests, however, that the child in question\nwas not assigned to the school he preferred because he\nmissed the kindergarten application deadline. See App. in\n05–915, p. 20. After he had enrolled and after the aca\ndemic year had begun, he then applied to transfer to his\npreferred school after the kindergarten assignment dead\nline had passed, id., at 21, possibly causing school officials\nto treat his late request as an application to transfer to the\nfirst grade, in respect to which the guidelines apply. I am\nnot certain just how the remainder of JUSTICE KENNEDY’s\nconcerns affect the lawfulness of the Louisville program,\nfor they seem to be failures of explanation, not of admini\nstration. But Louisville should be able to answer the\nrelevant questions on remand.\n   JUSTICE KENNEDY’s second concern is directly related to\nthe merits of Seattle’s plan: Why does Seattle’s plan group\nAsian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native-Americans,\nand African-Americans together, treating all as similar\nminorities? Ante, at 6–7. The majority suggests that\nSeattle’s classification system could permit a school to be\nlabeled “diverse” with a 50% Asian-American and 50%\nwhite student body, and no African-American students,\nHispanic students, or students of other ethnicity. Ante, at\n6; ante, at 15–16 (opinion of the Court).\n   The 50/50 hypothetical has no support in the record\nhere; it is conjured from the imagination. In fact, Seattle\napparently began to treat these different minority groups\nalike in response to the federal Emergency School Aid\nAct’s requirement that it do so. Siqueland 116–117. See\nalso Hanawalt 31; Pub. L. 95–561, Tit. VI (1978) (prescrib\n\f54    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ning percentage enrollment requirements for “minority”\nstudents); Siqueland 55 (discussing HEW definition of\n“minority”). Moreover, maintaining this federally man\ndated system of classification makes sense insofar as\nSeattle’s experience indicates that the relevant circum\nstances in respect to each of these different minority\ngroups are roughly similar, e.g., in terms of residential\npatterns, and call for roughly similar responses. This is\nconfirmed by the fact that Seattle has been able to achieve\na desirable degree of diversity without the greater empha\nsis on race that drawing fine lines among minority groups\nwould require. Does the plurality’s view of the Equal\nProtection Clause mean that courts must give no weight to\nsuch a board determination? Does it insist upon especially\nstrong evidence supporting inclusion of multiple minority\ngroups in an otherwise lawful government minority-\nassistance program? If so, its interpretation threatens to\nproduce divisiveness among minority groups that is in\ncompatible with the basic objectives of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Regardless, the plurality cannot object that\nthe constitutional defect is the individualized use of race\nand simultaneously object that not enough account of\nindividuals’ race has been taken.\n    Finally, I recognize that the Court seeks to distinguish\nGrutter from these cases by claiming that Grutter arose in\n“ ‘the context of higher education.’ ” Ante, at 16. But that\nis not a meaningful legal distinction. I have explained\nwhy I do not believe the Constitution could possibly find\n“compelling” the provision of a racially diverse education\nfor a 23-year-old law student but not for a 13-year-old high\nschool pupil. See supra, at 46–48. And I have explained\nhow the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than\nthose in Grutter. See supra, at 45. I add that one cannot\nfind a relevant distinction in the fact that these school\ndistricts did not examine the merits of applications “indi\nvidual[ly].” See ante, at 13–15. The context here does not\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           55\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\ninvolve admission by merit; a child’s academic, artistic,\nand athletic “merits” are not at all relevant to the child’s\nplacement. These are not affirmative action plans, and\nhence “individualized scrutiny” is simply beside the point.\n  The upshot is that these plans’ specific features—(1)\ntheir limited and historically-diminishing use of race, (2)\ntheir strong reliance upon other non-race-conscious ele\nments, (3) their history and the manner in which the\ndistricts developed and modified their approach, (4) the\ncomparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably\nevident alternatives—together show that the districts’\nplans are “narrowly tailored” to achieve their “compelling”\ngoals. In sum, the districts’ race-conscious plans satisfy\n“strict scrutiny” and are therefore lawful.\n                             IV\n                      Direct Precedent\n  Two additional precedents more directly related to the\nplans here at issue reinforce my conclusion. The first\nconsists of the District Court determination in the Louis\nville case when it dissolved its desegregation order that\nthere was “overwhelming evidence of the Board’s good\nfaith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its\nunderlying purposes,” indeed that the Board had “treated\nthe ideal of an integrated system as much more than a\nlegal obligation—they consider it a positive, desirable\npolicy and an essential element of any well-rounded public\nschool education.” Hampton II, 102 F. Supp. 2d, at 370.\nWhen the court made this determination in 2000, it did so\nin the context of the Louisville desegregation plan that the\nboard had adopted in 1996. That plan, which took effect\nbefore 1996, is the very plan that in all relevant respects is\nin effect now and is the subject of the present challenge.\n  No one claims that (the relevant portion of) Louisville’s\nplan was unlawful in 1996 when Louisville adopted it. To\nthe contrary, there is every reason to believe that it repre\n\f56    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nsented part of an effort to implement the 1978 desegrega\ntion order. But if the plan was lawful when it was first\nadopted and if it was lawful the day before the District\nCourt dissolved its order, how can the plurality now sug\ngest that it became unlawful the following day? Is it\nconceivable that the Constitution, implemented through a\ncourt desegregation order, could permit (perhaps require)\nthe district to make use of a race-conscious plan the day\nbefore the order was dissolved and then forbid the district\nto use the identical plan the day after? See id., at 380\n(“The very analysis for dissolving desegregation decrees\nsupports continued maintenance of a desegregated system\nas a compelling state interest”). The Equal Protection\nClause is not incoherent. And federal courts would rightly\nhesitate to find unitary status if the consequences of the\nruling were so dramatically disruptive.\n   Second, Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 458 U. S. 457, is\ndirectly on point. That case involves the original Seattle\nPlan, a more heavily race-conscious predecessor of the very\nplan now before us. In Seattle School Dist. No. 1, this\nCourt struck down a state referendum that effectively\nbarred implementation of Seattle’s desegregation plan and\n“burden[ed] all future attempts to integrate Washington\nschools in districts throughout the State.” Id., at 462–463,\n483. Because the referendum would have prohibited the\nadoption of a school-integration plan that involved manda\ntory busing, and because it would have imposed a special\nburden on school integration plans (plans that sought to\nintegrate previously segregated schools), the Court found\nit unconstitutional. Id., at 483–487.\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court did not directly\naddress the constitutional merits of the underlying Seattle\nplan. But it explicitly cited Swann’s statement that the\nConstitution permitted a local district to adopt such a\nplan. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. It also cited to Justice\nPowell’s opinion in Bakke, approving of the limited use of\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)            57\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nrace-conscious criteria in a university-admissions “af\nfirmative action” case. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. In addi\ntion, the Court stated that “[a]ttending an ethnically\ndiverse school,” id., at 473, could help prepare “minority\nchildren for citizenship in our pluralistic society,” hope\nfully “teaching members of the racial majority to live in\nharmony and mutual respect with children of minority\nheritage.” Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n   It is difficult to believe that the Court that held uncon\nstitutional a referendum that would have interfered with\nthe implementation of this plan thought that the integra\ntion plan it sought to preserve was itself an unconstitu\ntional plan. And if Seattle School Dist. No. 1 is premised\nupon the constitutionality of the original Seattle Plan, it is\nequally premised upon the constitutionality of the present\nplan, for the present plan is the Seattle Plan, modified\nonly insofar as it places even less emphasis on race-\nconscious elements than its predecessors.\n   It is even more difficult to accept the plurality’s contrary\nview, namely that the underlying plan was unconstitu\ntional. If that is so, then all of Seattle’s earlier (even more\nrace-conscious) plans must also have been unconstitu\ntional. That necessary implication of the plurality’s posi\ntion strikes the 13th chime of the clock. How could the\nplurality adopt a constitutional standard that would hold\nunconstitutional large numbers of race-conscious integra\ntion plans adopted by numerous school boards over the\npast 50 years while remaining true to this Court’s deseg\nregation precedent?\n                          V\n                    Consequences\n  The Founders meant the Constitution as a practical\ndocument that would transmit its basic values to future\ngenerations through principles that remained workable\n\f58     PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n               SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                   BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nover time. Hence it is important to consider the potential\nconsequences of the plurality’s approach, as measured\nagainst the Constitution’s objectives. To do so provides\nfurther reason to believe that the plurality’s approach is\nlegally unsound.\n   For one thing, consider the effect of the plurality’s views\non the parties before us and on similar school districts\nthroughout the Nation. Will Louisville and all similar\nschool districts have to return to systems like Louisville’s\ninitial 1956 plan, which did not consider race at all? See\nsupra, at 12. That initial 1956 plan proved ineffective.\nSixteen years into the plan, 14 of 19 middle and high\nschools remained almost totally white or almost totally\nblack. Ibid.\n   The districts’ past and current plans are not unique.\nThey resemble other plans, promulgated by hundreds of\nlocal school boards, which have attempted a variety of\ndesegregation methods that have evolved over time in\nlight of experience. A 1987 Civil Rights Commission\nStudy of 125 school districts in the Nation demonstrated\nthe breadth and variety of desegregation plans:\n        “The [study] documents almost 300 desegregation\n     plans that were implemented between 1961 and 1985.\n     The degree of heterogeneity within these districts is\n     immediately apparent. They are located in every re\n     gion of the country and range in size from Las Cruces,\n     New Mexico, with barely over 15,000 students attend\n     ing 23 schools in 1968, to New York City, with more\n     than one million students in 853 schools. The sample\n     includes districts in urban areas of all sizes, suburbs\n     (e.g., Arlington County, Virginia) and rural areas (e.g.,\n     Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and Raleigh County,\n     West Virginia). It contains 34 countywide districts\n     with central cities (the 11 Florida districts fit this de\n     scription, plus Clark County, Nevada and others) and\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U.

At the\n    other extreme, Santa Clara, California had a rela\n    tively even racial distribution prior to its 1979 deseg\n    regation plan. When the 1965 plan was designed for\n    Harford County, Maryland, the district was 92 per\n    cent white. Compton, California, on the other hand,\n    became over 99 percent black in the 1980s, while Buf\n    falo, New York had a virtual 50–50 split between\n    white and minority students prior to its 1977 plan.\n       “It is not surprising to find a large number of differ\n    ent desegregation strategies in a sample with this\n    much variation.” Welch 23 (footnotes omitted).\nA majority of these desegregation techniques explicitly\nconsidered a student’s race. See id., at 24–28. Transfer\nplans, for example, allowed students to shift from a school\nin which they were in the racial majority to a school in\nwhich they would be in a racial minority. Some districts,\nsuch as Richmond, California, and Buffalo, New York,\npermitted only “one-way” transfers, in which only black\nstudents attending predominantly black schools were\npermitted to transfer to designated receiver schools. Id.,\nat 25. Fifty-three of the 125 studied districts used trans\nfers as a component of their plans. Id., at 83–91.\n  At the state level, 46 States and Puerto Rico have\nadopted policies that encourage or require local school\ndistricts to enact interdistrict or intradistrict open choice\nplans. Eight of those States condition approval of trans\nfers to another school or district on whether the transfer\nwill produce increased racial integration.

See Education Commission of the States,\nOpen Enrollment: 50-State Report (2007), online at\nhttp://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=268.\n  Arkansas, for example, provides by statute that “[n]o\nstudent may transfer to a nonresident district where the\npercentage of enrollment for the student’s race exceeds\nthat percentage in the student’s resident district.” Ark.\nCode Ann. §6–18–206(f)(1), as amended 2007 Ark. Gen.\nActs 552 (2007). An Ohio statute provides, in respect to\nstudent choice, that each school district must establish\n“[p]rocedures to ensure that an appropriate racial balance\nis maintained in the district schools.” Ohio Rev. Code\nAnn. §3313.98(B)(2)(b)(iii) (Lexis Supp. 2006). Ohio adds\nthat a “district may object to the enrollment of a native\nstudent in an adjacent or other district in order to main\ntain an appropriate racial balance.” §3313.98 (F)(1)(a).\n  A Connecticut statute states that its student choice\nprogram will seek to “preserve racial and ethnic balance.”\nConn. Gen. Stat. §10–266aa(b)(2) (2007). Connecticut law\nrequires each school district to submit racial group popu\nlation figures to the State Board of Education. §10–226a.\nAnother Connecticut regulation provides that “[a]ny school\nin which the Proportion for the School falls outside of a\nrange from 25 percentage points less to 25 percentage\npoints more than the Comparable Proportion for the\nSchool District, shall be determined to be racially imbal\nanced.” Conn. Agencies Regs. §10–226e–3(b) (1999). A\n“racial imbalance” determination requires the district to\nsubmit a plan to correct the racial imbalance, which plan\nmay include “mandatory pupil reassignment.” §§10–226e–\n5(a) and (c)(4).\n  Interpreting that State’s Constitution, the Connecticut\nSupreme Court has held legally inadequate the reliance by\na local school district solely upon some of the techniques\n\f                 Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)           61\n\n                     BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nJUSTICE KENNEDY today recommends (e.g., reallocating\nresources, etc.). See Sheff v. O’Neill, 238 Conn. 1, 678\nA. 2d 1267 (1996). The State Supreme Court wrote: “De\nspite the initiatives undertaken by the defendants to\nalleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among\nschool districts, and despite the fact that the defendants\ndid not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the\ndisparities that continue to burden the education of the\nplaintiffs infringe upon their fundamental state constitu\ntional right to a substantially equal educational opportu\nnity.” Id., at 42, 678 A. 2d, at 1289.\n   At a minimum, the plurality’s views would threaten a\nsurge of race-based litigation. Hundreds of state and\nfederal statutes and regulations use racial classifications\nfor educational or other purposes. See supra, at 27. In\nmany such instances, the contentious force of legal chal\nlenges to these classifications, meritorious or not, would\ndisplace earlier calm.\n   The wide variety of different integration plans that\nschool districts use throughout the Nation suggests that\nthe problem of racial segregation in schools, including de\nfacto segregation, is difficult to solve. The fact that many\nsuch plans have used explicitly racial criteria suggests\nthat such criteria have an important, sometimes neces\nsary, role to play. The fact that the controlling opinion\nwould make a school district’s use of such criteria often\nunlawful (and the plurality’s “colorblind” view would make\nsuch use always unlawful) suggests that today’s opinion\nwill require setting aside the laws of several States and\nmany local communities.\n   As I have pointed out, supra, at 4, de facto resegregation\nis on the rise. See Appendix A, infra. It is reasonable to\nconclude that such resegregation can create serious educa\ntional, social, and civic problems. See supra, at 37–45.\nGiven the conditions in which school boards work to set\npolicy, see supra, at 20–21, they may need all of the means\n\f62    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST.

Yet\nthe plurality would deprive them of at least one tool that\nsome districts now consider vital—the limited use of broad\nrace-conscious student population ranges.\n    I use the words “may need” here deliberately. The\nplurality, or at least those who follow JUSTICE THOMAS’\n“ ‘color-blind’ ” approach, see ante, at 26–27 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring); Grutter, 539 U. S., at 353–354 (THOMAS, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part), may feel confi\ndent that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end\nall governmental use of race-conscious criteria including\nthose with inclusive objectives. See ante, at 40–41 (plural\nity opinion); see also ante, at 26 (THOMAS, J., concurring).\nBy way of contrast, I do not claim to know how best to stop\nharmful discrimination; how best to create a society that\nincludes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious\nproblems of increasing de facto segregation, troubled inner\ncity schooling, and poverty correlated with race. But, as a\njudge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize\njudges to dictate solutions to these problems. Rather, the\nConstitution creates a democratic political system through\nwhich the people themselves must together find answers.\nAnd it is for them to debate how best to educate the Na\ntion’s children and how best to administer America’s\nschools to achieve that aim. The Court should leave them\nto their work. And it is for them to decide, to quote the\nplurality’s slogan, whether the best “way to stop discrimi\nnation on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the\nbasis of race.” Ante, at 40–41. See also Parents Involved\nVII, 426 F. 3d, at 1222 (Bea, J., dissenting) (“The way to\nend racial discrimination is to stop discriminating by\nrace”). That is why the Equal Protection Clause outlaws\ninvidious discrimination, but does not similarly forbid all\nuse of race-conscious criteria.\n    Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as\naffording the people, acting through their elected repre\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

See Adarand\nConstructors, Inc., 515 U. S., at 237 (“[S]trict scrutiny” in\nthis context is “[not] ‘strict in theory, but fatal in fact’ ”\n(quoting Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concur\nring in judgment))). Today, however, the Court restricts\n(and some Members would eliminate) that leeway. I fear\nthe consequences of doing so for the law, for the schools,\nfor the democratic process, and for America’s efforts to\ncreate, out of its diversity, one Nation.\n                             VI\n                         Conclusions\n   To show that the school assignment plans here meet the\nrequirements of the Constitution, I have written at excep\ntional length. But that length is necessary. I cannot refer\nto the history of the plans in these cases to justify the use\nof race-conscious criteria without describing that history\nin full. I cannot rely upon Swann’s statement that the use\nof race-conscious limits is permissible without showing,\nrather than simply asserting, that the statement repre\nsents a constitutional principle firmly rooted in federal\nand state law. Nor can I explain my disagreement with\nthe Court’s holding and the plurality’s opinion, without\noffering a detailed account of the arguments they pro\npound and the consequences they risk.\n   Thus, the opinion’s reasoning is long. But its conclusion\nis short: The plans before us satisfy the requirements of\nthe Equal Protection Clause. And it is the plurality’s\nopinion, not this dissent that “fails to ground the result it\nwould reach in law.” Ante, at 28.\n   Four basic considerations have led me to this view.\nFirst, the histories of Louisville and Seattle reveal com\nplex circumstances and a long tradition of conscientious\nefforts by local school boards to resist racial segregation in\npublic schools. Segregation at the time of Brown gave way\n\f64    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\nto expansive remedies that included busing, which in turn\ngave rise to fears of white flight and resegregation. For\ndecades now, these school boards have considered and\nadopted and revised assignment plans that sought to rely\nless upon race, to emphasize greater student choice, and to\nimprove the conditions of all schools for all students, no\nmatter the color of their skin, no matter where they hap\npen to reside. The plans under review—which are less\nburdensome, more egalitarian, and more effective than\nprior plans—continue in that tradition. And their history\nreveals school district goals whose remedial, educational,\nand democratic elements are inextricably intertwined each\nwith the others. See Part I, supra, at 2–21.\n   Second, since this Court’s decision in Brown, the law\nhas consistently and unequivocally approved of both vol\nuntary and compulsory race-conscious measures to combat\nsegregated schools. The Equal Protection Clause, ratified\nfollowing the Civil War, has always distinguished in prac\ntice between state action that excludes and thereby subor\ndinates racial minorities and state action that seeks to\nbring together people of all races. From Swann to Grutter,\nthis Court’s decisions have emphasized this distinction,\nrecognizing that the fate of race relations in this country\ndepends upon unity among our children, “for unless our\nchildren begin to learn together, there is little hope that\nour people will ever learn to live together.” Milliken, 418\nU. S., at 783 (Marshall, J., dissenting). See also C. Sum\nner, Equality Before the Law: Unconstitutionality of Sepa\nrate Colored Schools in Massachusetts, in 2 The Works of\nCharles Sumner 327, 371 (1849) (“The law contemplates\nnot only that all be taught, but that all shall be taught\ntogether”). See Part II, supra, at 21–37.\n   Third, the plans before us, subjected to rigorous judicial\nreview, are supported by compelling state interests and\nare narrowly tailored to accomplish those goals. Just as\ndiversity in higher education was deemed compelling in\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U. S. ____ (2007)             65\n\n                      BREYER, J., dissenting\n\nGrutter, diversity in public primary and secondary\nschools—where there is even more to gain—must be, a\nfortiori, a compelling state interest. Even apart from\nGrutter, five Members of this Court agree that “avoiding\nracial isolation” and “achiev[ing] a diverse student popula\ntion” remain today compelling interests. Ante, at 17–18\n(opinion of KENNEDY, J.). These interests combine reme\ndial, educational, and democratic objectives. For the\nreasons discussed above, however, I disagree with JUSTICE\nKENNEDY that Seattle and Louisville have not done\nenough to demonstrate that their present plans are neces\nsary to continue upon the path set by Brown. These plans\nare more “narrowly tailored” than the race-conscious law\nschool admissions criteria at issue in Grutter. Hence,\ntheir lawfulness follows a fortiori from this Court’s prior\ndecisions. See Parts III–IV, supra, at 37–57.\n   Fourth, the plurality’s approach risks serious harm to\nthe law and for the Nation. Its view of the law rests either\nupon a denial of the distinction between exclusionary and\ninclusive use of race-conscious criteria in the context of the\nEqual Protection Clause, or upon such a rigid application\nof its “test” that the distinction loses practical significance.\nConsequently, the Court’s decision today slows down and\nsets back the work of local school boards to bring about\nracially diverse schools. See Part V, supra, at 57–63.\n   Indeed, the consequences of the approach the Court\ntakes today are serious. Yesterday, the plans under re\nview were lawful. Today, they are not. Yesterday, the\ncitizens of this Nation could look for guidance to this\nCourt’s unanimous pronouncements concerning desegre\ngation. Today, they cannot. Yesterday, school boards had\navailable to them a full range of means to combat segre\ngated schools. Today, they do not.\n   The Court’s decision undermines other basic institu\ntional principles as well. What has happened to stare\ndecisis? The history of the plans before us, their educa\n\f66    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\ntional importance, their highly limited use of race—all\nthese and more—make clear that the compelling interest\nhere is stronger than in Grutter. The plans here are more\nnarrowly tailored than the law school admissions program\nthere at issue. Hence, applying Grutter’s strict test, their\nlawfulness follows a fortiori. To hold to the contrary is to\ntransform that test from “strict” to “fatal in fact”—the very\nopposite of what Grutter said. And what has happened to\nSwann? To McDaniel? To Crawford? To Harris? To\nSchool Committee of Boston? To Seattle School Dist. No.\n1? After decades of vibrant life, they would all, under the\nplurality’s logic, be written out of the law.\n   And what of respect for democratic local decisionmaking\nby States and school boards? For several decades this\nCourt has rested its public school decisions upon Swann’s\nbasic view that the Constitution grants local school dis\ntricts a significant degree of leeway where the inclusive\nuse of race-conscious criteria is at issue. Now localities\nwill have to cope with the difficult problems they face\n(including resegregation) deprived of one means they may\nfind necessary.\n   And what of law’s concern to diminish and peacefully\nsettle conflict among the Nation’s people? Instead of\naccommodating different good-faith visions of our country\nand our Constitution, today’s holding upsets settled expec\ntations, creates legal uncertainty, and threatens to pro\nduce considerable further litigation, aggravating race-\nrelated conflict.\n   And what of the long history and moral vision that the\nFourteenth Amendment itself embodies? The plurality\ncites in support those who argued in Brown against segre\ngation, and JUSTICE THOMAS likens the approach that I\nhave taken to that of segregation’s defenders. See ante, at\n39–41 (plurality opinion) (comparing Jim Crow segrega\ntion to Seattle and Louisville’s integration polices); ante,\nat 28–32 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But segregation poli\n\f                  Cite as: 551 U.

The lesson of history, see ante, at\n39 (plurality opinion), is not that efforts to continue racial\nsegregation are constitutionally indistinguishable from\nefforts to achieve racial integration. Indeed, it is a cruel\ndistortion of history to compare Topeka, Kansas, in the\n1950’s to Louisville and Seattle in the modern day—to\nequate the plight of Linda Brown (who was ordered to\nattend a Jim Crow school) to the circumstances of Joshua\nMcDonald (whose request to transfer to a school closer to\nhome was initially declined). This is not to deny that\nthere is a cost in applying “a state-mandated racial label.”\nAnte, at 17 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concur\nring in judgment). But that cost does not approach, in\ndegree or in kind, the terrible harms of slavery, the result\ning caste system, and 80 years of legal racial segregation.\n                        *    *    *\n   Finally, what of the hope and promise of Brown? For\nmuch of this Nation’s history, the races remained divided.\nIt was not long ago that people of different races drank\nfrom separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and\nstudied in separate schools. In this Court’s finest hour,\nBrown v. Board of Education challenged this history and\nhelped to change it. For Brown held out a promise. It was\na promise embodied in three Amendments designed to\nmake citizens of slaves. It was the promise of true racial\nequality—not as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a\nmatter of everyday life in the Nation’s cities and schools.\nIt was about the nature of a democracy that must work for\nall Americans. It sought one law, one Nation, one people,\nnot simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of\nhow we actually live.\n\f68    PARENTS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS v.\n\n              SEATTLE SCHOOL DIST. NO. 1\n\n                  BREYER, J., dissenting \n\n\n   Not everyone welcomed this Court’s decision in Brown.\nThree years after that decision was handed down, the\nGovernor of Arkansas ordered state militia to block the\ndoors of a white schoolhouse so that black children could\nnot enter. The President of the United States dispatched\nthe 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, and\nfederal troops were needed to enforce a desegregation\ndecree. See Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958). Today,\nalmost 50 years later, attitudes toward race in this Nation\nhave changed dramatically. Many parents, white and\nblack alike, want their children to attend schools with\nchildren of different races. Indeed, the very school dis\ntricts that once spurned integration now strive for it. The\nlong history of their efforts reveals the complexities and\ndifficulties they have faced. And in light of those chal\nlenges, they have asked us not to take from their hands\nthe instruments they have used to rid their schools of\nracial segregation, instruments that they believe are\nneeded to overcome the problems of cities divided by race\nand poverty. The plurality would decline their modest\nrequest.\n   The plurality is wrong to do so. The last half-century\nhas witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we\nhave not yet realized the promise of Brown. To invalidate\nthe plans under review is to threaten the promise of\nBrown. The plurality’s position, I fear, would break that\npromise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation\nwill come to regret.\n   I must dissent.\n\f                     Cite as: 551 U.

BREYER, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which STEVENS, SOUTER, and GINSBURG, JJ., joined.</p>\n<p>CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS announced the judgment of the</p>\n<p>Court, and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III-A, and III-C, and an opinion with respect to Parts III-B and IV, in which JUSTICES SCALIA, THOMAS, and ALITO join.</p>\n<p>The school districts in these cases voluntarily adopted student assignment plans that rely upon race to determine which public schools certain children may attend. The Seattle school district classifies children as white or non-white; the Jefferson County school district as black or \"other.\" In Seattle, this racial classification is used to allocate slots in oversubscribed high schools. In Jefferson County, it is used to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests. In each case, the school district relies upon an individual student's race in assigning that student to a particular school, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a predetermined range based on the racial composition of the school district as a whole. Parents of students denied assignment to particular schools under these plans solely because of their race brought suit, contending that allocating children to different public schools on the basis of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans. We granted certiorari, and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Both cases present the same underlying legal question whether a public school that had not operated legally segregated schools or has been found to be unitary may choose to classify students by race and rely upon that classification in making school assignments. Although we examine the plans under the same legal framework, the specifics of the two plans, and the circumstances surrounding their adoption, are in some respects quite different.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Seattle School District No. 1 operates 10 regular public high schools. In 1998, it adopted the plan at issue in this case for assigning students to these schools. App. in No. 05-908, pp. 90a-92a.<sup>[1]</sup> The plan allows incoming ninth graders to choose from among any of the district's high schools, ranking however many schools they wish in order of preference.</p>\n<p>Some schools are more popular than others. If too many students list the same school as their first choice, the district employs a series of \"tiebreakers\" to determine who will fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school. The first tiebreaker selects for admission students who have a sibling currently enrolled in the chosen school. The next tiebreaker depends upon the racial composition of the particular school and the race of the individual student. In the district's public schools approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are white; the remaining 59 percent, comprising all other racial groups, are classified by Seattle for assignment purposes as nonwhite. <i>Id.,</i> at 38a, 103a.<sup>[2]</sup> If an oversubscribed school is not within 10 percentage points of the district's overall white/nonwhite racial balance, it is what the district calls \"integration positive,\" and the district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assignment students whose race \"will serve to bring the school into balance.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38a. See <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> 426 F. 3d 1162, 1169-1170 (CA9 2005) (en banc).<sup>[3]</sup> If it is still necessary to select students for the school after using the racial tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is the geographic proximity of the school to the student's residence. App. in No. 05-908, at 38a.</p>\n<p>Seattle has never operated segregated schoolslegally separate schools for students of different racesnor has it ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation. It none-theless employs the racial tiebreaker in an attempt to address the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns on school assignments. Most white students live in the northern part of Seattle, most students of other racial backgrounds in the southern part. <i>Parents Involved VII, supra,</i> at 1166. Four of Seattle's high schools are located in the northBallard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Rooseveltand five in the southRainier Beach, Cleveland, West Seattle, Chief Sealth, and Franklin. One school Garfieldis more or less in the center of Seattle. App. in No. 05-908, at 38a-39a, 45a.</p>\n<p>For the 2000-2001 school year, five of these schools were oversubscribedBallard, Nathan Hale, Roosevelt, Garfield, and Franklinso much so that 82 percent of incoming ninth graders ranked one of these schools as their first choice. <i>Id.,</i> at 38a. Three of the oversubscribed schools were \"integration positive\" because the school's white enrollment the previous school year was greater than 51 percentBallard, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt. Thus, more nonwhite students (107, 27, and 82, respectively) who selected one of these three schools as a top choice received placement at the school than would have been the case had race not been considered, and proximity been the next tiebreaker. <i>Id.,</i> at 39a40a. Franklin was \"integration positive\" because its nonwhite enrollment the previous school year was greater than 69 percent; 89 more white students were assigned to Franklin by operation of the racial tiebreaker in the 2000-2001 school year than otherwise would have been. <i>Ibid.</i> Garfield was the only oversubscribed school whose composition during the 1999-2000 school year was within the racial guidelines, although in previous years Garfield's enrollment had been predominantly nonwhite, and the racial tiebreaker had been used to give preference to white students. <i>Id.,</i> at 39a.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools (Parents Involved) is a nonprofit corporation comprising the parents of children who have been or may be denied assignment to their chosen high school in the district because of their race. The concerns of Parents Involved are illustrated by Jill Kurfirst, who sought to enroll her ninth-grade son, Andy Meeks, in Ballard High School's special Biotechnology Career Academy. Andy suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, but had made good progress with hands-on instruction, and his mother and middle school teachers thought that the smaller biotechnology program held the most promise for his continued success. Andy was accepted into this selective program but, because of the racial tiebreaker, was denied assignment to Ballard High School. <i>Id.,</i> at 143a-146a, 152a-160a. Parents Involved commenced this suit in the Western District of Washington, alleging that Seattle's use of race in assignments violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<sup>[4]</sup> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<sup>[5]</sup> and the Washington Civil Rights Act.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 28a-35a.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment to the school district, finding that state law did not bar the district's use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. 137 F. Supp. 2d 1224, 1240 (WD Wash. 2001) (<i>Parents Involved I</i>). The Ninth Circuit initially reversed based on its interpretation of the Washington Civil Rights Act, 285 F. 3d 1236, 1253 (2002) (<i>Parents Involved II</i>), and enjoined the district's use of the integration tiebreaker, <i>id.,</i> at 1257. Upon realizing that the litigation would not be resolved in time for assignment decisions for the 2002-2003 school year, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its opinion, 294 F. 3d 1084 (2002) (<i>Parents Involved III</i>), vacated the injunction, and, pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code §2.60.020 (2006), certified the state-law question to the Washington Supreme Court, 294 F. 3d 1085, 1087 (2002) (<i>Parents Involved IV</i>).</p>\n<p>The Washington Supreme Court determined that the State Civil Rights Act bars only preferential treatment programs \"where race or gender is used by government to select a less qualified applicant over a more qualified applicant,\" and not \"[p]rograms which are racially neutral, such as the [district's] open choice plan.\" <i>Parents Involved in Community Schools</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist., No. 1,</i> 149 Wash. 2d 660, 689-690, 663, 72 P. 3d 151, 166, 153 (2003) (en banc) (<i>Parents Involved V</i>). The state court returned the case to the Ninth Circuit for further proceedings. <i>Id.,</i> at 690, 72 P. 3d, at 167.</p>\n<p>A panel of the Ninth Circuit then again reversed the District Court, this time ruling on the federal constitutional question. <i>Parents Involved VI,</i> 377 F. 3d 949 (2004). The panel determined that while achieving racial diversity and avoiding racial isolation are compelling government interests, <i>id.,</i> at 964, Seattle's use of the racial tiebreaker was not narrowly tailored to achieve these interests, <i>id.,</i> at 980. The Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc, 395 F. 3d 1168 (2005), and overruled the panel decision, affirming the District Court's determination that Seattle's plan was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest, <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> 426 F. 3d, at 1192-1193. We granted certiorari. 547 U. S. ___ (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Jefferson County Public Schools operates the public school system in metropolitan Louisville, Kentucky. In 1973 a federal court found that Jefferson County had maintained a segregated school system, <i>Newburg Area Council, Inc.</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Jefferson Cty.,</i> 489 F. 2d 925, 932 (CA6), vacated and remanded, 418 U. S. 918, reinstated with modifications, 510 F. 2d 1358, 1359 (CA6 1974), and in 1975 the District Court entered a desegregation decree. See <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</i> 72 F. Supp. 2d 753, 762-764 (WD Ky. 1999). Jefferson County operated under this decree until 2000, when the District Court dissolved the decree after finding that the district had achieved unitary status by eliminating \"[t]o the greatest extent practicable\" the vestiges of its prior policy of segregation. <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</i> 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 360 (2000). See <i>Board of Ed. of Oklahoma City Public Schools</i> v. <i>Dowell,</i> 498 U. S. 237, 249-250 (1991); <i>Green</i> v. <i>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,</i> 391 U. S. 430, 435-436 (1968).</p>\n<p>In 2001, after the decree had been dissolved, Jefferson County adopted the voluntary student assignment plan at issue in this case. App. in No. 05-915, p. 77. Approximately 34 percent of the district's 97,000 students are black; most of the remaining 66 percent are white. <i>McFarland</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Public Schools,</i> 330 F. Supp. 2d 834, 839-840, and n. 6 (WD Ky. 2004) (<i>McFarland I</i>). The plan requires all nonmagnet schools to maintain a minimum black enrollment of 15 percent, and a maximum black enrollment of 50 percent. App. in No. 05-915, at 81; <i>McFarland I, supra,</i> at 842.</p>\n<p>At the elementary school level, based on his or her address, each student is designated a \"resides\" school to which students within a specific geographic area are assigned; elementary resides schools are \"grouped into clusters in order to facilitate integration.\" App. in No. 05-915, at 82. The district assigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two ways: Parents of kindergartners, first-graders, and students new to the district may submit an application indicating a first and second choice among the schools within their cluster; students who do not submit such an application are assigned within the cluster by the district. \"Decisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the schools and the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38. If a school has reached the \"extremes of the racial guidelines,\" a student whose race would contribute to the school's racial imbalance will not be assigned there. <i>Id.,</i> at 38-39, 82. After assignment, students at all grade levels are permitted to apply to transfer between nonmagnet schools in the district. Transfers may be requested for any number of reasons, and may be denied because of lack of available space or on the basis of the racial guidelines. <i>Id.,</i> at 43.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>When petitioner Crystal Meredith moved into the school district in August 2002, she sought to enroll her son, Joshua McDonald, in kindergarten for the 2002-2003 school year. His resides school was only a mile from his new home, but it had no available spaceassignments had been made in May, and the class was full. Jefferson County assigned Joshua to another elementary school in his cluster, Young Elementary. This school was 10 miles from home, and Meredith sought to transfer Joshua to a school in a different cluster, Bloom Elementary, whichlike his resides schoolwas only a mile from home. See Tr. in <i>McFarland I,</i> pp. 1-49 through 1-54 (Dec. 8, 2003). Space was available at Bloom, and intercluster transfers are allowed, but Joshua's transfer was nonetheless denied because, in the words of Jefferson County, \"[t]he transfer would have an adverse effect on desegregation compliance\" of Young. App. in No. 05-915, at 97.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Meredith brought suit in the Western District of Kentucky, alleging violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court found that Jefferson County had asserted a compelling interest in maintaining racially diverse schools, and that the assignment plan was (in all relevant respects) narrowly tailored to serve that compelling interest. <i>McFarland I, supra,</i> at 837.<sup>[9]</sup> The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a <i>per curiam</i> opinion relying upon the reasoning of the District Court, concluding that a written opinion \"would serve no useful purpose.\" <i>McFarland</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Public Schools,</i> 416 F. 3d 513, 514 (2005) (<i>McFarland II</i>). We granted certiorari. 547 U. S. __ (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must assure ourselves of our jurisdiction. Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because none of its current members can claim an imminent injury. Even if the district maintains the current plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, Seattle argues, Parents Involved members will only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a Seattle public high school and choose an oversubscribed school that is integration positivetoo speculative a harm to maintain standing. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, pp. 16-17.</p>\n<p>This argument is unavailing. The group's members have children in the district's elementary, middle, and high schools, App. in No. 05-908, at 299a-301a; Affidavit of Kathleen Brose Pursuant to this Court's Rule 32.3 (Lodging of Petitioner Parents Involved), and the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of Parents Involved members whose elementary and middle school children may be \"denied admission to the high schools of their choice when they apply for those schools in the future,\" App. in No. 05-908, at 30a. The fact that it is possible that children of group members will not be denied admission to a school based on their race-because they choose an undersubscribed school or an oversubscribed school in which their race is an advantagedoes not eliminate the injury claimed. Moreover, Parents Involved also asserted an interest in not being \"forced to compete for seats at certain high schools in a system that uses race as a deciding factor in many of its admissions decisions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> As we have held, one form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause is being forced to compete in a race-based system that may prejudice the plaintiff, <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 211 (1995); <i>Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America</i> v. <i>Jacksonville,</i> 508 U. S. 656, 666 (1993), an injury that the members of Parents Involved can validly claim on behalf of their children.</p>\n<p>In challenging standing, Seattle also notes that it has ceased using the racial tiebreaker pending the outcome of this litigation. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, at 16-17. But the district vigorously defends the constitutionality of its race-based program, and nowhere suggests that if this litigation is resolved in its favor it will not resume using race to assign students. Voluntary cessation does not moot a case or controversy unless \"subsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,\" <i>Friends of Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U. S. 167, 189 (2000) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.,</i> 393 U. S. 199, 203 (1968) (internal quotation marks omitted)), a heavy burden that Seattle has clearly not met.</p>\n<p>Jefferson County does not challenge our jurisdiction, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, p. 48, but we are nonetheless obliged to ensure that it exists, <i>Arbaugh</i> v. <i>Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> 546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006). Although apparently Joshua has now been granted a transfer to Bloom, the school to which transfer was denied under the racial guidelines, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 45, the racial guidelines apply at all grade levels. Upon Joshua's enrollment in middle school, he may again be subject to assignment based on his race. In addition, Meredith sought damages in her complaint, which is sufficient to preserve our ability to consider the question. <i>Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Lyons,</i> 461 U. S. 95, 109 (1983).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>It is well established that when the government distributes burdens or benefits on the basis of individual racial classifications, that action is reviewed under strict scrutiny. <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 543 U. S. 499, 505-506 (2005); <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 306, 326 (2003); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 224. As the Court recently reaffirmed, \"`racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification.'\" <i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 244, 270 (2003) (quoting <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> 448 U. S. 448, 537 (1980) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); brackets omitted). In order to satisfy this searching standard of review, the school districts must demonstrate that the use of individual racial classifications in the assignment plans here under review is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve a \"compelling\" government interest. <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 227.</p>\n<p>Without attempting in these cases to set forth all the interests a school district might assert, it suffices to note that our prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classifications in the school context, have recognized two interests that qualify as compelling. The first is the compelling interest of remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination. See <i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992). Yet the Seattle public schools have not shown that they were ever segregated by law, and were not subject to court-ordered desegregation decrees. The Jefferson County public schools were previously segregated by law and were subject to a desegregation decree entered in 1975. In 2000, the District Court that entered that decree dissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had \"eliminated the vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its pernicious effects,\" and thus had achieved \"unitary\" status. <i>Hampton,</i> 102 F. Supp. 2d, at 360. Jefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an interest in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination in defending its present use of race in assigning students. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 38.</p>\n<p>Nor could it. We have emphasized that the harm being remedied by mandatory desegregation plans is the harm that is traceable to segregation, and that \"the Constitution is not violated by racial imbalance in the schools, without more.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 433 U. S. 267, 280, n. 14 (1977). See also <i>Freeman, supra,</i> at 495-496; <i>Dowell,</i> 498 U. S., at 248; <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 418 U. S. 717, 746 (1974). Once Jefferson County achieved unitary status, it had remedied the constitutional wrong that allowed racebased assignments. Any continued use of race must be justified on some other basis.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The second government interest we have recognized as compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny is the interest in diversity in higher education upheld in <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 328. The specific interest found compelling in <i>Grutter</i> was student body diversity \"in the context of higher education.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The diversity interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed \"all factors that may contribute to student body diversity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 337. We described the various types of diversity that the law school sought:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[The law school's] policy makes clear there are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 338 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court quoted the articulation of diversity from Justice Powell's opinion in <i>Regents of the University of California </i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265 (1978), noting that \"it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 324-325 (citing and quoting <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 314-315 (opinion of Powell, J.); brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, what was upheld in <i>Grutter</i> was consideration of \"a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\" 539 U. S., at 325 (quoting <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The entire gist of the analysis in <i>Grutter</i> was that the admissions program at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not simply as a member of a particular racial group. The classification of applicants by race upheld in <i>Grutter</i> was only as part of a \"highly individualized, holistic review,\" 539 U. S., at 337. As the Court explained, \"[t]he importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which the <i>Grutter</i> Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court explained would be \"patently unconstitutional.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 330.</p>\n<p>In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve \"exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,\" <i>ibid.</i>; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone. The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself. It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in <i>Grutter</i>; it is <i>the</i> factor. Like the University of Michigan undergraduate plan struck down in <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U. S., at 275, the plans here \"do not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants\" but instead rely on racial classifications in a \"nonindividualized, mechanical\" way. <i>Id.,</i> at 276, 280 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/\"other\" terms in Jefferson County.<sup>[11]</sup> But see <i>Metro Broadcasting, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC,</i> 497 U. S. 547, 610 (1990) (\"We are a Nation not of black and white alone, but one teeming with divergent communities knitted together with various traditions and carried forth, above all, by individuals\") (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The Seattle \"Board Statement Reaffirming Diversity Rationale\" speaks of the \"inherent educational value\" in \"[p]roviding students the opportunity to attend schools with diverse student enrollment,\" App. in No. 05-908, at 128a, 129a. But under the Seattle plan, a school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not. It is hard to understand how a plan that could allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is \"`broadly diverse,'\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 329.</p>\n<p>Prior to <i>Grutter,</i> the courts of appeals rejected as unconstitutional attempts to implement race-based assignment plans-such as the plans at issue herein primary and secondary schools. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Eisenberg</i> v. <i>Montgomery Cty. Public Schools,</i> 197 F. 3d 123, 133 (CA4 1999); <i>Tuttle</i> v. <i>Arlington Cty. School Bd.,</i> 195 F. 3d 698, 701 (CA4 1999); <i>Wessman</i> v. <i>Gittens,</i> 160 F. 3d 790, 809 (CA1 1998). See also <i>Ho</i> v. <i>San Francisco Unified School Dist.,</i> 147 F. 3d 854, 865 (CA9 1998). After <i>Grutter,</i> however, the two Courts of Appeals in these cases, and one other, found that race-based assignments were permissible at the elementary and secondary level, largely in reliance on that case. See <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> 426 F. 3d, at 1166; <i>McFarland II,</i> 416 F. 3d, at 514; <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> 418 F. 3d 1, 13 (CA1 2005).</p>\n<p>In upholding the admissions plan in <i>Grutter,</i> though, this Court relied upon considerations unique to institutions of higher education, noting that in light of \"the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.\" 539 U. S., at 329. See also <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 312, 313 (opinion of Powell, J.). The Court explained that \"[c]ontext matters\" in applying strict scrutiny, and repeatedly noted that it was addressing the use of race \"in the context of higher education.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 327, 328, 334. The Court in <i>Grutter</i> expressly articulated key limitations on its holding defining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher educationbut these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending <i>Grutter</i> to uphold race-based assignments in elementary and secondary schools. The present cases are not governed by <i>Grutter.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Perhaps recognizing that reliance on <i>Grutter</i> cannot sustain their plans, both school districts assert additional interests, distinct from the interest upheld in <i>Grutter,</i> to justify their race-based assignments. In briefing and argument before this Court, Seattle contends that its use of race helps to reduce racial concentration in schools and to ensure that racially concentrated housing patterns do not prevent nonwhite students from having access to the most desirable schools. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, at 19. Jefferson County has articulated a similar goal, phrasing its interest in terms of educating its students \"in a racially integrated environment.\" App. in No. 05-915, at 22.<sup>[12]</sup> Each school district argues that educational and broader socialization benefits flow from a racially diverse learning environment, and each contends that because the diversity they seek is racial diversity not the broader diversity at issue in <i>Grutter</i>it makes sense to promote that interest directly by relying on race alone.</p>\n<p>The parties and their <i>amici</i> dispute whether racial diversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits. The debate is not one we need to resolve, however, because it is clear that the racial classifications employed by the districts are not narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits asserted to flow from racial diversity. In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, pure and simple, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.</p>\n<p>The plans are tied to each district's specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits. In Seattle, the district seeks white enrollment of between 31 and 51 percent (within 10 percent of \"the district white average\" of 41 percent), and nonwhite enrollment of between 49 and 69 percent (within 10 percent of \"the district minority average\" of 59 percent). App. in No. 05-908, at 103a. In Jefferson County, by contrast, the district seeks black enrollment of no less than 15 or more than 50 percent, a range designed to be \"equally above and below Black student enrollment systemwide,\" <i>McFarland I,</i> 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 842, based on the objective of achieving at \"all schools . . . an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment\" of 34 percent. App. in No. 05-915, at 81. In Seattle, then, the benefits of racial diversity require enrollment of at least 31 percent white students; in Jefferson County, at least 50 percent. There must be at least 15 percent nonwhite students under Jefferson County's plan; in Seattle, more than three times that figure. This comparison makes clear that the racial demographics in each districtwhatever they happen to be drive the required \"diversity\" numbers. The plans here are not tailored to achieving a degree of diversity necessary  to realize the asserted educational benefits; instead the plans are tailored, in the words of Seattle's Manager of Enrollment Planning, Technical Support, and Demographics, to \"the goal established by the school board of attaining a level of diversity within the schools that approximates the district's overall demographics.\" App. in No. 05-908, at 42a.</p>\n<p>The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective school districtsor rather the white/nonwhite or black/\"other\" balance of the districts, since that is the only diversity addressed by the plans. Indeed, in its brief Seattle simply assumes that the educational benefits track the racial breakdown of the district. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05908, at 36 (\"For Seattle, `racial balance' is clearly not an end in itself but rather a measure of the extent to which the educational goals the plan was designed to foster are likely to be achieved\"). When asked for \"a range of percentage that would be diverse,\" however, Seattle's expert said it was important to have \"sufficient numbers so as to avoid students feeling any kind of specter of exceptionality.\" App. in No. 05-908, at 276a. The district did not attempt to defend the proposition that anything outside its range posed the \"specter of exceptionality.\" Nor did it demonstrate in any way how the educational and social benefits of racial diversity or avoidance of racial isolation are more likely to be achieved at a school that is 50 percent white and 50 percent AsianA-merican, which would qualify as diverse under Seattle's plan, than at a school that is 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white, which under Seattle's definition would be racially concentrated.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Jefferson County's expert referred to the importance of having \"at least 20 percent\" minority group representation for the group \"to be visible enough to make a difference,\" and noted that \"small isolated minority groups in a school are not likely to have a strong effect on the overall school.\" App. in No. 05-915, at 159, 147. The Jefferson County plan, however, is based on a goal of replicating at each school \"an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide AfricanA-merican enrollment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 81. Joshua McDonald's requested transfer was denied because his race was listed as \"other\" rather than black, and allowing the transfer would have had an adverse effect on the racial guideline compliance of Young Elementary, the school he sought to leave. <i>Id.,</i> at 21. At the time, however, Young Elementary was 46.8 percent black. <i>Id.,</i> at 73. The transfer might have had an adverse effect on the effort to approach district-wide racial proportionality at Young, but it had nothing to do with preventing either the black or \"other\" group from becoming \"small\" or \"isolated\" at Young.</p>\n<p>In fact, in each case the extreme measure of relying on race in assignments is unnecessary to achieve the stated goals, even as defined by the districts. For example, at Franklin High School in Seattle, the racial tiebreaker was applied because nonwhite enrollment exceeded 69 percent, and resulted in an incoming ninth-grade class in 2000-2001 that was 30.3 percent Asian-American, 21.9 percent African-American, 6.8 percent Latino, 0.5 percent NativeA-merican, and 40.5 percent Caucasian. Without the racial tiebreaker, the class would have been 39.6 percent AsianA-merican, 30.2 percent African-American, 8.3 percent Latino, 1.1 percent Native-American, and 20.8 percent Caucasian. See App. in No. 05-908, at 308a. When the actual racial breakdown is considered, enrolling students without regard to their race yields a substantially diverse student body under any definition of diversity.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Grutter,</i> the number of minority students the school sought to admit was an undefined \"meaningful number\" necessary to achieve a genuinely diverse student body. 539 U. S., at 316, 335-336. Although the matter was the subject of disagreement on the Court, see <i>id.,</i> at 346-347 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 382-383 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 388-392 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), the majority concluded that the law school did not count back from its applicant pool to arrive at the \"meaningful number\" it regarded as necessary to diversify its student body. <i>Id.,</i> at 335-336. Here the racial balance the districts seek is a defined range set solely by reference to the demographics of the respective school districts.</p>\n<p>This working backward to achieve a particular type of racial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits, is a fatal flaw under our existing precedent. We have many times over reaffirmed that \"[r]acial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake.\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 494. See also <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U. S. 469, 507 (1989); <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.) (\"If petitioner's purpose is to assure within its student body some specified percentage of a particular group merely because of its race or ethnic origin, such a preferential purpose must be rejected . . . as facially invalid\"). <i>Grutter</i> itself reiterated that \"outright racial balancing\" is \"patently unconstitutional.\" 539 U. S., at 330.</p>\n<p>Accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify the imposition of racial proportionality throughout American society, contrary to our repeated recognition that \"[a]t the heart of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals, not as simply components of a racial, religious, sexual or national class.\" <i>Miller</i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 515 U. S. 900, 911 (1995) (quoting <i>Metro Broadcasting,</i> 497 U. S., at 602 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); internal quotation marks omitted).<sup>[14]</sup> Allowing racial balancing as a compelling end in itself would \"effectively assur[e] that race will always be relevant in American life, and that the `ultimate goal' of `eliminating entirely from governmental decisionmaking such irrelevant factors as a human being's race' will never be achieved.\" <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 495 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.) (quoting <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> 476 U. S. 267, 320 (1986) (STEVENS, J., dissenting), in turn quoting <i>Fullilove,</i> 448 U. S., at 547 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); brackets and citation omitted). An interest \"linked to nothing other than proportional representation of various races . . . would support indefinite use of racial classifications, employed first to obtain the appropriate mixture of racial views and then to ensure that the [program] continues to reflect that mixture.\" <i>Metro Broadcasting, supra,</i> at 614 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The validity of our concern that racial balancing has \"no logical stopping point,\" <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 498 (quoting <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 275 (plurality opinion); internal quotation marks omitted); see also <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 343, is demonstrated here by the degree to which the districts tie their racial guidelines to their demographics. As the districts' demographics shift, so too will their definition of racial diversity. See App. in No. 05-908, at 103a (describing application of racial tiebreaker based on \"<i>current</i> white percentage\" of 41 percent and \"<i>current</i> minority percentage\" of 59 percent (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit below stated that it \"share[d] in the hope\" expressed in <i>Grutter</i> that in 25 years racial preferences would no longer be necessary to further the interest identified in that case. <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> 426 F. 3d, at 1192. But in Seattle the plans are defended as necessary to address the consequences of racially identifiable housing patterns. The sweep of the mandate claimed by the district is contrary to our rulings that remedying past societal discrimination does not justify race-conscious government action. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Hunt,</i> 517 U. S. 899, 909-910 (1996) (\"[A]n effort to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest\"); <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 498-499; <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion) (\"Societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy\"); <i>id.,</i> at 288 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[A] governmental agency's interest in remedying `societal' discrimination, that is, discrimination not traceable to its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster\").</p>\n<p>The principle that racial balancing is not permitted is one of substance, not semantics. Racial balancing is not transformed from \"patently unconstitutional\" to a compelling state interest simply by relabeling it \"racial diversity.\" While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promoteracial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration they offer no definition of the interest that suggests it differs from racial balance. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-908, at 257a (\"Q. What's your understanding of when a school suffers from racial isolation? A. I don't have a definition for that\"); <i>id.,</i> at 228a-229a (\"I don't think we've ever sat down and said, `Define racially concentrated school exactly on point in quantitative terms.' I don't think we've ever had that conversation\"); Tr. in <i>McFarland I,</i> at 1-90 (Dec. 8, 2003) (\"Q. How does the Jefferson County School Board define diversity . . . ?\" \"A. Well, we want to have the schools that make up the percentage of students of the population\").</p>\n<p>Jefferson County phrases its interest as \"racial integration,\" but integration certainly does not require the sort of racial proportionality reflected in its plan. Even in the context of mandatory desegregation, we have stressed that racial proportionality is not required, see <i>Milliken,</i> 433 U. S., at 280, n. 14 (\"[A desegregation] order contemplating the substantive constitutional right [to a] particular degree of racial balance or mixing is . . . infirm as a matter of law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S. 1, 24 (1971) (\"The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole\"), and here Jefferson County has already been found to have eliminated the vestiges of its prior segregated school system.</p>\n<p>The en banc Ninth Circuit declared that \"when a racially diverse school system is the goal (or racial concentration or isolation is the problem), there is no more effective means than a consideration of race to achieve the solution.\" <i>Parents Involved VII, supra,</i> at 1191. For the foregoing reasons, this conclusory argument cannot sustain the plans. However closely related race-based assignments may be to achieving racial balance, that itself cannot be the goal, whether labeled \"racial diversity\" or anything else. To the extent the objective is sufficient diversity so that students see fellow students as individuals rather than solely as members of a racial group, using means that treat students solely as members of a racial group is fundamentally at cross-purposes with that end.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The districts assert, as they must, that the way in which they have employed individual racial classifications is necessary to achieve their stated ends. The minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments, however, suggests that other means would be effective. Seattle's racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools. Approximately 307 student assignments were affected by the racial tie-breaker in 2000-2001; the district was able to track the enrollment status of 293 of these students. App. in No. 05-908, at 162a. Of these, 209 were assigned to a school that was one of their choices, 87 of whom were assigned to the same school to which they would have been assigned without the racial tiebreaker. Eighty-four students were assigned to schools that they did not list as a choice, but 29 of those students would have been assigned to their respective school without the racial tiebreaker, and 3 were able to attend one of the oversubscribed schools due to waitlist and capacity adjustments. <i>Id.,</i> at 162a-163a. In over one-third of the assignments affected by the racial tiebreaker, then, the use of race in the end made no difference, and the district could identify only 52 students who were ultimately affected adversely by the racial tiebreaker in that it resulted in assignment to a school they had not listed as a preference and to which they would not otherwise have been assigned.</p>\n<p>As the panel majority in <i>Parents Involved VI</i> concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he tiebreaker's annual effect is thus merely to shuffle a few handfuls of different minority students between a few schoolsabout a dozen additional Latinos into Ballard, a dozen black students into Nathan Hale, perhaps two dozen Asians into Roosevelt, and so on. The District has not met its burden of proving these marginal changes . . . outweigh the cost of subjecting hundreds of students to disparate treatment based solely upon the color of their skin.\" 377 F. 3d, at 984985 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Jefferson County's use of racial classifications has only a minimal effect on the assignment of students. Elementary school students are assigned to their first- or second-choice school 95 percent of the time, and transfers, which account for roughly 5 percent of assignments, are only denied 35 percent of the timeand presumably an even smaller percentage are denied on the basis of the racial guidelines, given that other factors may lead to a denial. <i>McFarland I,</i> 330 F. Supp. 2d, at 844-845, nn. 16, 18. Jefferson County estimates that the racial guidelines account for only 3 percent of assignments. Brief in Opposition in No. 05-915, p. 7, n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 46. As Jefferson County explains, \"the racial guidelines have minimal impact in this process, because they `mostly influence student assignment in subtle and indirect ways.'\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, pp. 8-9.</p>\n<p>While we do not suggest that <i>greater</i> use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts' racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications. In <i>Grutter,</i> the consideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law schoolfrom 4 to 14.5 percent. See 539 U. S., at 320. Here the most Jefferson County itself claims is that \"because the guidelines provide a firm definition of the Board's goal of racially integrated schools, they `provide administrators with the authority to facilitate, negotiate and collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the 15-50% range.'\" Brief in Opposition in No. 05-915, at 7 (quoting <i>McFarland I, supra,</i> at 842). Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of our precedents and our Nation's history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.</p>\n<p>The districts have also failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals. Narrow tailoring requires \"serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plansmany of which would not have used express racial classificationswere rejected with little or no consideration. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-908, at 224a-225a, 253a-259a, 307a. Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 8-9. Compare <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (racial classifications permitted only \"as a last resort\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent takes a different approach to these cases, one that fails to ground the result it would reach in law. Instead, it selectively relies on inapplicable precedent and even dicta while dismissing contrary holdings, alters and misapplies our well-established legal framework for assessing equal protection challenges to express racial classifications, and greatly exaggerates the consequences of today's decision. To begin with, JUSTICE BREYER seeks to justify the plans at issue under our precedents recognizing the compelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimination. See <i>post,</i> at 18-24. Not even the school districts go this far, and for good reason. The distinction between segregation by state action and racial imbalance caused by other factors has been central to our jurisprudence in this area for generations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Milliken,</i> 433 U. S., at 280, n. 14; <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 495-496 (\"Where resegregation is a product not of state action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications\"). The dissent elides this distinction between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation, casually intimates that Seattle's school attendance patterns reflect illegal segregation, <i>post,</i> at 5, 18, 23,<sup>[15]</sup> and fails to credit the judicial determinationunder the most rigorous standardthat Jefferson County had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation. The dissent thus alters in fundamental ways not only the facts presented here but the established law.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's reliance on <i>McDaniel</i> v. <i>Barresi,</i> 402 U. S. 39 (1971), <i>post,</i> at 23-24, 29-30, highlights how far removed the discussion in the dissent is from the question actually presented in these cases. <i>McDaniel</i> concerned a Georgia school system that had been segregated by law. There was no doubt that the county had operated a \"dual school system,\" <i>McDaniel, supra,</i> at 41, and no one questions that the obligation to disestablish a school system segregated by law can include race-conscious remedies whether or not a court had issued an order to that effect. See <i>supra,</i> at 12. The present cases are before us, how-ever, because the Seattle school district was never segregated by law, and the Jefferson County district has been found to be unitary, having eliminated the vestiges of its prior dual status. The justification for race-conscious remedies in <i>McDaniel</i> is therefore not applicable here. The dissent's persistent refusal to accept this distinction its insistence on viewing the racial classifications here as if they were just like the ones in <i>McDaniel,</i> \"devised to overcome a history of segregated public schools,\" <i>post,</i> at 47explains its inability to understand why the remedial justification for racial classifications cannot decide these cases.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent next relies heavily on dicta from <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S., at 16-far more heavily than the school districts themselves. Compare <i>post,</i> at 3, 22-28, with Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, at 19-20; Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 31. The dissent acknowledges that the two-sentence discussion in <i>Swann</i> was pure dicta, <i>post,</i> at 22, but nonetheless asserts that it demonstrates a \"basic principle of constitutional law\" that provides \"authoritative legal guidance.\" <i>Post,</i> at 22, 30. Initially, as the Court explained just last Term, \"we are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at issue was not fully debated.\" <i>Central Va. Community College</i> v. <i>Katz,</i> 546 U. S. 356, 363 (2006). That is particularly true given that, when <i>Swann</i> was decided, this Court had not yet confirmed that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications like those before us. See n. 16, <i>infra.</i> There is nothing \"technical\" or \"theoretical,\" <i>post,</i> at 30, about our approach to such dicta. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 6 Wheat. 264, 399-400 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (explaining why dicta is not binding).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER would not only put such extraordinary weight on admitted dicta, but relies on the statement for something it does not remotely say. <i>Swann</i> addresses only a possible state objective; it says nothing of the permissible <i>means</i>race conscious or otherwisethat a school district might employ to achieve that objective. The reason for this omission is clear enough, since the case did not involve any voluntary means adopted by a school district. The dissent's characterization of <i>Swann</i> as recognizing that \"the Equal Protection Clause permits local school boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals\" isat besta dubious inference. <i>Post,</i> at 22. Even if the dicta from <i>Swann</i> were entitled to the weight the dissent would give it, and no dicta is, it not only did not address the question presented in <i>Swann,</i> it also does not address the question presented in these caseswhether the school districts' use of racial classifications to achieve their stated goals is permissible.</p>\n<p>Further, for all the lower court cases JUSTICE BREYER cites as evidence of the \"prevailing legal assumption\" embodied by <i>Swann,</i> very few are pertinent. Most are not. For example, the dissent features <i>Tometz</i> v. <i>Board of Ed., Waukegan City School Dist. No. 61,</i> 39 Ill. 2d 593, 596-598, 237 N. E. 2d 498, 500-502 (1968), an Illinois decision, as evidence that \"state and federal courts had considered the matter settled and uncontroversial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 25. But <i>Tometz</i> addressed a challenge to a statute requiring race-consciousness in drawing school attendance boundaries-an issue well beyond the scope of the question presented in these cases. Importantly, it considered that issue only under rational-basis review, 39 Ill. 2d, at 600, 237 N. E. 2d, at 502 (\"The test of any legislative classification essentially is one of reasonableness\"), which even the dissent grudgingly recognizes is an improper standard for evaluating express racial classifications. Other cases cited are similarly inapplicable. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Citizens for Better Ed.</i> v. <i>Goose Creek Consol. Independent School Dist.,</i> 719 S. W. 2d 350, 352-353 (Tex. App. 1986) (upholding rezoning plan under rational-basis review).<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent next looks for authority to a footnote in <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S. 457, 472, n. 15 (1982), <i>post,</i> at 56-57, but there this Court expressly noted that it was <i>not</i> passing on the propriety of race-conscious student assignments in the absence of a finding of <i>de jure</i> segregation. Similarly, the citation of <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles,</i> 458 U. S. 527 (1982), <i>post,</i> at 24, in which a state referendum prohibiting a race-based assignment plan was challenged, is inappositein <i>Crawford</i> the Court again expressly reserved the question presented by these cases. 458 U. S.<i>,</i> at 535, n. 11. Such reservations and preliminary analyses of course did not decide the merits of this questionas evidenced by the disagreement among the lower courts on this issue. Compare <i>Eisenberg,</i> 197 F. 3d, at 133, with <i>Comfort,</i> 418 F. 3d, at 13.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent also asserts that these cases are controlled by <i>Grutter,</i> claiming that the existence of a compelling interest in these cases \"follows <i>a fortiori</i>\" from <i>Grutter, post,</i> at 41, 64-66, and accusing us of tacitly overruling that case, see <i>post,</i> at 64-66. The dissent overreads <i>Grutter,</i> however, in suggesting that it renders pure racial balancing a constitutionally compelling interest; <i>Grutter</i> itself recognized that using race simply to achieve racial balance would be \"patently unconstitutional,\" 539 U. S.<i>,</i> at 330. The Court was exceedingly careful in describing the interest furthered in <i>Grutter</i> as \"not an interest in simple ethnic diversity\" but rather a \"far broader array of qualifications and characteristics\" in which race was but a single element. 539 U. S., at 324-325 (internal quotation marks omitted). We take the <i>Grutter</i> Court at its word. We simply do not understand how JUSTICE</p>\n<p>BREYER can maintain that classifying every schoolchild as black or white, and using that classification as a determinative factor in assigning children to achieve pure racial balance, can be regarded as \"less burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored\" than the consideration of race in <i>Grutter, post,</i> at 47, when the Court in <i>Grutter</i> stated that \"[t]he importance of . . . individualized consideration\" in the program was \"paramount,\" and consideration of race was one factor in a \"highly individualized, holistic review.\" 539 U. S., at 337. Certainly if the constitutionality of the stark use of race in these cases were as established as the dissent would have it, there would have been no need for the extensive analysis undertaken in <i>Grutter.</i> In light of the foregoing, JUSTICE BREYER's appeal to <i>stare decisis</i> rings particularly hollow. See <i>post,</i> at 65-66.</p>\n<p>At the same time it relies on inapplicable desegregation cases, misstatements of admitted dicta, and other noncontrolling pronouncements, JUSTICE BREYER's dissent candidly dismisses the significance of this Court's repeated <i>holdings</i> that all racial classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny, see <i>post,</i> at 31-33, 35-36, arguing that a different standard of review should be applied because the districts use race for beneficent rather than malicious purposes, see <i>post,</i> at 31-36.</p>\n<p>This Court has recently reiterated, however, that \"`<i>all</i> racial classifications [imposed by government] . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.' \" <i>Johnson,</i> 543 U. S., at 505 (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227; emphasis added by <i>Johnson</i> Court). See also <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 326 (\"[G]overnmental action based on race  a group classification long recognized as in most circum-stances irrelevant and therefore prohibitedshould be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry\" (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)). JUSTICE BREYER nonetheless relies on the good intentions and motives of the school districts, stating that he has found \"no case that . . . repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to <i>exclude</i> and that which seeks to <i>include</i> members of minority races.\" <i>Post,</i> at 29 (emphasis in original). We have found many. Our cases clearly reject the argument that motives affect the strict scrutiny analysis. See <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 505 (\"We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called `benign' racial classifications\"); <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227 (rejecting idea that \"`benign'\" racial classifications may be held to \"different standard\"); <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 500 (\"Racial classifications are suspect, and that means that simple legislative assurances of good intention cannot suffice\").</p>\n<p>This argument that different rules should govern racial classifications designed to include rather than exclude is not new; it has been repeatedly pressed in the past, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Gratz,</i> 539 U. S., at 282 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 301 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 243 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 316-317 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and has been repeatedly rejected. See also <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 289-291 (opinion of Powell, J.) (rejecting argument that strict scrutiny should be applied only to classifications that disadvantage minorities, stating \"[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination\").</p>\n<p>The reasons for rejecting a motives test for racial classifications are clear enough. \"The Court's emphasis on `benign racial classifications' suggests confidence in its ability to distinguish good from harmful governmental uses of racial criteria. History should teach greater humility.. . . `[B]enign' carries with it no independent meaning, but reflects only acceptance of the current generation's conclusion that a politically acceptable burden, imposed on particular citizens on the basis of race, is reasonable.\" <i>Metro Broadcasting,</i> 497 U. S., at 609-610 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). See also <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 226 (\"`[I]t may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign'\" (quoting <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.))). Accepting JUSTICE BREYER's approach would \"do no more than move us from `separate but equal' to `unequal but benign.'\" <i>Metro Broadcasting, supra,</i> at 638 (KENN-EDY, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER speaks of bringing \"the races\" together (putting aside the purely black-and-white nature of the plans), as the justification for excluding individuals on the basis of their race. See <i>post,</i> at 28-29. Again, this approach to racial classifications is fundamentally at odds with our precedent, which makes clear that the Equal Protection Clause \"protect[s] <i>persons,</i> not <i>groups,</i>\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227 (emphasis in original). See <i>ibid.</i> (\"[A]ll governmental action based on racea <i>group</i> classification long recognized as `in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited,' <i>Hirabayashi</i> [v. <i>United States,</i> 320 U. S. 81, 100 (1943)]should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the <i>personal</i> right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed\" (first emphasis in original); <i>Metro Broadcasting, supra,</i> at 636 (\"[O]ur Constitution protects each citizen as an individual, not as a member of a group\" (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)); <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 289 (opinion of Powell, J.) (Fourteenth Amendment creates rights \"guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights\"). This fundamental principle goes back, in this context, to <i>Brown</i> itself. See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955) (<i>Brown II</i>) (\"At stake is the <i>personal</i> interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools . . . on a nondiscriminatory basis\" (emphasis added)). For the dissent, in contrast, \"`individualized scrutiny' is simply beside the point.\" <i>Post,</i> at 55.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's position comes down to a familiar claim: The end justifies the means. He admits that \"there is a cost in applying `a state-mandated racial label,'\" <i>post,</i> at 67, but he is confident that the cost is worth paying. Our established strict scrutiny test for racial classifications, however, insists on \"detailed examination, both as to ends <i>and</i> as to means.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 236 (emphasis added). Simply because the school districts may seek a worthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on the basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial classifications should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Despite his argument that these cases should be evaluated under a \"standard of review that is not `strict' in the traditional sense of that word,\" <i>post,</i> at 36, JUSTICE</p>\n<p>BREYER still purports to apply strict scrutiny to these cases. See <i>post,</i> at 37. It is evident, however, that JUSTICE BREYER's brand of narrow tailoring is quite unlike anything found in our precedents. Without any detailed discussion of the operation of the plans, the students who are affected, or the districts' failure to consider race-neutral alternatives, the dissent concludes that the districts have shown that these racial classifications are necessary to achieve the districts' stated goals. This conclusion is divorced from any evaluation of the actual impact of the plans at issue in these casesother than to note that the plans \"often have no effect.\" <i>Post,</i> at 46.<sup>[17]</sup> Instead, the dissent suggests that some combination of the development of these plans over time, the difficulty of the endeavor, and the good faith of the districts suffices to demonstrate that these stark and controlling racial classifications are constitutional. The Constitution and our precedents require more.</p>\n<p>In keeping with his view that strict scrutiny should not apply, JUSTICE BREYER repeatedly urges deference to local school boards on these issues. See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 21, 48-49, 66. Such deference \"is fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence. We put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 543 U. S., at 506, n. 1. See <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 501 (\"The history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis\"); <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette,</i> 319 U. S. 624, 637 (1943) (\"The Fourteenth Amendment . . . protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creaturesBoards of Education not excepted\").</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent ends on an unjustified note of alarm. It predicts that today's decision \"threaten[s]\" the validity of \"[h]undreds of state and federal statutes and regulations.\" <i>Post,</i> at 61; see also <i>post,</i> at 27-28. But the examples the dissent mentionsfor example, a provision of the No Child Left Behind Act that requires States to set measurable objectives to track the achievement of students from major racial and ethnic groups, 20 U. S. C. §6311(b)(2)(C)(v)have nothing to do with the pertinent issues in these cases.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER also suggests that other means for achieving greater racial diversity in schools are necessarily unconstitutional if the racial classifications at issue in these cases cannot survive strict scrutiny. <i>Post,</i> at 58-62. These other means<i>e.g.,</i> where to construct new schools, how to allocate resources among schools, and which academic offerings to provide to attract students to certain schoolsimplicate different considerations than the explicit racial classifications at issue in these cases, and we express no opinion on their validitynot even in dicta. Rather, we employ the familiar and well-established analytic approach of strict scrutiny to evaluate the plans at issue today, an approach that in no way warrants the dissent's cataclysmic concerns. Under that approach, the school districts have not carried their burden of showing that the ends they seek justify the particular extreme means they have chosenclassifying individual students on the basis of their race and discriminating among them on that basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts' own terms, the costs are undeniable. \"[D]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 214 (internal quotation marks omitted). Government action dividing us by race is inherently suspect because such classifications promote \"notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,\" <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 493, \"reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin,\" <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno,</i> 509 U. S. 630, 657 (1993), and \"endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.\" <i>Metro Broadcasting,</i> 497 U. S., at 603 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). As the Court explained in <i>Rice</i> v. <i>Cayetano,</i> 528 U. S. 495, 517 (2000), \"[o]ne of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.\"</p>\n<p>All this is true enough in the contexts in which these statements were madegovernment contracting, voting districts, allocation of broadcast licenses, and electing state officersbut when it comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard. In <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (<i>Brown I</i>), we held that segregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were equal, because government classification and separation on grounds of race themselves denoted inferiority. <i>Id.,</i> at 493-494. It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954. See <i>id.,</i> at 494 (\"`The impact [of segregation] is greater when it has the sanction of the law' \"). The next Term, we accordingly stated that \"full compliance\" with <i>Brown I</i> required school districts \"to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools <i>on a nonracial basis.</i>\" <i>Brown II,</i> 349 U. S., at 300-301 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The parties and their <i>amici</i> debate which side is more faithful to the heritage of <i>Brown,</i> but the position of the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> was spelled out in their brief and could not have been clearer: \"[T]he Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from according differential treatment to American children on the basis of their color or race.\" Brief for Appellants in Nos. 1, 2, and 4 and for Respondents in No. 10 on Reargument in <i>Brown I,</i> O. T. 1953, p. 15 (Summary of Argument). What do the racial classifications at issue here do, if not accord differential treatment on the basis of race? As counsel who appeared before this Court for the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> put it: \"We have one fundamental contention which we will seek to develop in the course of this argument, and that contention is that no State has any authority under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in affording educational opportunities among its citizens.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Brown I,</i> p. 7 (Robert L. Carter, Dec. 9, 1952). There is no ambiguity in that statement. And it was that position that prevailed in this Court, which emphasized in its remedial opinion that what was \"[a]t stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable <i>on a nondiscriminatory basis,</i>\" and what was required was \"determining admission to the public schools <i>on a non-racial basis.</i>\" <i>Brown II, supra,</i> at 300-301 (emphasis added). What do the racial classifications do in these cases, if not determine admission to a public school on a racial basis?</p>\n<p>Before <i>Brown,</i> schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once againeven for very different reasons. For schools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as Seattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segregation, such as Jefferson County, the way \"to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis,\" <i>Brown II,</i> 349 U. S., at 300-301, is to stop assigning students on a racial basis. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.</p>\n<p>The judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Ninth Circuits are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Today, the Court holds that state entities may not experiment with race-based means to achieve ends they deem socially desirable. I wholly concur in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion. I write separately to address several of the contentions in JUSTICE BREYER's dissent (hereinafter the dissent). Contrary to the dissent's arguments, reseg-regation is not occurring in Seattle or Louisville; these school boards have no present interest in remedying past segregation; and these race-based student-assignment programs do not serve any compelling state interest. Accordingly, the plans are unconstitutional. Disfavoring a color-blind interpretation of the Constitution, the dissent would give school boards a free hand to make decisions on the basis of racean approach reminiscent of that advocated by the segregationists in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S 483 (1954). This approach is just as wrong today as it was a half-century ago. The Constitution and our cases require us to be much more demanding before permitting local school boards to make decisions based on race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The dissent repeatedly claims that the school districts are threatened with resegregation and that they will succumb to that threat if these plans are declared unconstitutional. It also argues that these plans can be justified as part of the school boards' attempts to \"eradicat[e] earlier school segregation.\" See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 4. Contrary to the dissent's rhetoric, neither of these school districts is threatened with resegregation, and neither is constitutionally compelled or permitted to undertake race-based remediation. Racial imbalance is not segregation, and the mere incantation of terms like resegregation and remediation cannot make up the difference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Because this Court has authorized and required race-based remedial measures to address <i>de jure</i> segregation, it is important to define segregation clearly and to distinguish it from racial imbalance. In the context of public schooling, segregation is the deliberate operation of a school system to \"carry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\" <i>Swann </i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S. 1, 6 (1971); see also <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Board of Comm'rs of Jackson,</i> 391 U. S. 450, 452 (1968). In <i>Brown,</i> this Court declared that segregation was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Swann, supra,</i> at 6; see also <i>Green</i> v. <i>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,</i> 391 U. S. 430, 435 (1968) (\"[T]he State, acting through the local school board and school officials, organized and operated a dual system, part `white' and part `Negro.' It was such dual systems that 14 years ago <i>Brown I</i>[, 347 U. S. 483,] held unconstitutional and a year later <i>Brown II</i>[, 349 U. S. 294 (1955)] held must be abolished\").<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Racial imbalance is the failure of a school district's individual schools to match or approximate the demographic makeup of the student population at large. Cf. <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S. 457, 460 (1982). Racial imbalance is not segregation.<sup>[2]</sup> Although presently observed racial imbalance might result from past <i>de jure</i> segregation, racial imbalance can also result from any number of innocent private decisions, including voluntary housing choices. See <i>Swann, supra,</i> at 25-26; <i>Missouri</i> v. <i>Jenkins,</i> 515 U. S. 70, 116 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring). Because racial imbalance is not inevitably linked to unconstitutional segregation, it is not unconstitutional in and of itself. <i>Dayton Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Brinkman,</i> 433 U. S. 406, 413 (1977); <i>Dayton Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Brinkman,</i> 443 U. S. 526, 531, n. 5 (1979) (\"Racial imbalance. . . is not <i>per se</i> a constitutional violation\"); <i>Freeman </i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992); see also <i>Swann, supra,</i> at 31-32; cf. <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 418 U. S. 717, 740-741, and n. 19 (1974).</p>\n<p>Although there is arguably a danger of racial imbalance in schools in Seattle and Louisville, there is no danger of resegregation. No one contends that Seattle has established or that Louisville has reestablished a dual school system that separates students on the basis of race. The statistics cited in Appendix A to the dissent are not to the contrary. See <i>post,</i> at 69-72. At most, those statistics show a national trend toward classroom racial imbalance. However, racial imbalance without intentional state action to separate the races does not amount to segregation. To raise the specter of resegregation to defend these programs is to ignore the meaning of the word and the nature of the cases before us.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Just as the school districts lack an interest in preventing resegregation, they also have no present interest in remedying past segregation. The Constitution generally prohibits government race-based decisionmaking, but this Court has authorized the use of race-based measures for remedial purposes in two narrowly defined circumstances. First, in schools that were formerly segregated by law, race-based measures are sometimes constitutionally compelled to remedy prior school segregation. Second, in <i>Croson,</i> the Court appeared willing to authorize a government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible. <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U. S. 469, 504 (1989). Without explicitly resting on either of these strands of doctrine, the dissent repeatedly invokes the school districts' supposed interests in remedying past segregation. Properly analyzed, though, these plans do not fall within either existing category of permissible racebased remediation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The Constitution does not permit race-based government decisionmaking simply because a school district claims a remedial purpose and proceeds in good faith with arguably pure motives. <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 306, 371 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 239 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). Rather, race-based government decisionmaking is categorically prohibited unless narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 326; see also Part II-A, <i>infra.</i> This exacting scrutiny \"has proven automatically fatal\" in most cases. <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 121 (THOMAS, J., concurring); cf. <i>Hirabayashi</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 320 U. S. 81, 100 (1943) (\"[R]acial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\"). And appropriately so. \"The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 353 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Therefore, as a general rule, all race-based government decisionmakingregardless of contextis unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>This Court has carved out a narrow exception to that general rule for cases in which a school district has a \"history of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system deliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\"<sup>[4]</sup> See <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 5-6. In such cases, race-based remedial measures are sometimes required.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Green,</i> 391 U. S., at 437-438; cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fordice,</i> 505 U. S. 717, 745 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring).<sup>[6]</sup> But without a history of state-enforced racial separation, a school district has no affirmative legal obligation to take race-based remedial measures to eliminate segregation and its vestiges.</p>\n<p>Neither of the programs before us today is compelled as a remedial measure, and no one makes such a claim. Seattle has no history of <i>de jure</i> segregation; therefore, the Constitution did not require Seattle's plan.<sup>[7]</sup> Although Louisville once operated a segregated school system and was subject to a Federal District Court's desegregation decree, see <i>ante,</i> at 7; <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</i> 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, 376-377 (WD Ky. 2000), that decree was dissolved in 2000, <i>id.,</i> at 360. Since then, no race-based remedial measures have been required in Louisville. Thus, the race-based student-assignment plan at issue here, which was instituted the year after the dissolution of the desegregation decree, was not even arguably required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Aside from constitutionally compelled remediation in schools, this Court has permitted government units to remedy prior racial discrimination only in narrow circumstances. See <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> 476 U. S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion). Regardless of the constitutional validity of such remediation, see <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 524-525 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), it does not apply here. Again, neither school board asserts that its race-based actions were taken to remedy prior discrimination. Seattle provides three forward-lookingas opposed to remedialjustifications for its race-based assignment plan. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, pp. 24-34. Louisville asserts several similar forward-looking interests, Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, pp. 24-29, and at oral argument, counsel for Louisville disavowed any claim that Louisville's argument \"depend[ed] in any way on the prior de jure segregation,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, p. 38.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, for a government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible, the Court has required it to demonstrate \"a `strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.'\" <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 500 (quoting <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 277 (plurality opinion)). Establishing a \"strong basis in evidence\" requires proper findings regarding the extent of the government unit's past racial discrimination. <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 504. The findings should \"define the scope of any injury [and] the necessary remedy,\" <i>id.,</i> at 505, and must be more than \"inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs,\" <i>id.,</i> at 506. Assertions of general societal discrimination are plainly insufficient. <i>Id.,</i> at 499, 504; <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 274 (plurality opinion); cf. <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265, 310 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Neither school district has made any such specific findings. For Seattle, the dissent attempts to make up for this failing by adverting to allegations made in past complaints filed against the Seattle school district. However, allegations in complaints cannot substitute for specific findings of prior discriminationeven when those allegations lead to settlements with complaining parties. Cf. <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 505; <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 279, n. 5 (plurality opinion). As for Louisville, its slate was cleared by the District Court's 2000 dissolution decree, which effectively declared that there were no longer any effects of <i>de jure</i> discrimination in need of remediation.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Despite the dissent's repeated intimation of a remedial purpose, neither of the programs in question qualifies as a permissible race-based remedial measure. Thus, the programs are subject to the general rule that government race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As the foregoing demonstrates, racial balancing is some-times a constitutionally permissible remedy for the discrete legal wrong of <i>de jure</i> segregation, and when directed to that end, racial balancing is an exception to the general rule that government race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional. Perhaps for this reason, the dissent conflates the concepts of segregation and racial imbalance: If racial imbalance equates to segregation, then it must also be constitutionally acceptable to use racial balancing to remedy racial imbalance.</p>\n<p>For at least two reasons, however, it is wrong to place the remediation of segregation on the same plane as the remediation of racial imbalance. First, as demonstrated above, the two concepts are distinct. Although racial imbalance can result from <i>de jure</i> segregation, it does not necessarily, and the further we get from the era of state  sponsored racial separation, the less likely it is that racial imbalance has a traceable connection to any prior segregation. See <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 496; <i>Jenkins,</i> 515 U. S., at 118 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Second, a school cannot \"remedy\" racial imbalance in the same way that it can remedy segregation. Remediation of past <i>de jure</i> segregation is a one-time process involving the redress of a discrete legal injury inflicted by an identified entity. At some point, the discrete injury will be remedied, and the school district will be declared unitary. See <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 31. Unlike <i>de jure</i> segregation, there is no ultimate remedy for racial imbalance. Individual schools will fall in and out of balance in the natural course, and the appropriate balance itself will shift with a school district's changing demographics. Thus, racial balancing will have to take place on an indefinite basisa continuous process with no identifiable culpable party and no discernable end point. In part for those reasons, the Court has never permitted outright racial balancing solely for the purpose of achieving a particular racial balance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Lacking a cognizable interest in remediation, neither of these plans can survive strict scrutiny because neither plan serves a genuinely compelling state interest. The dissent avoids reaching that conclusion by unquestioningly accepting the assertions of selected social scientists while completely ignoring the fact that those assertions are the subject of fervent debate. Ultimately, the dissent's entire analysis is corrupted by the considerations that lead it initially to question whether strict scrutiny should apply at all. What emerges is a version of \"strict scrutiny\" that combines hollow assurances of harmlessness with reflexive acceptance of conventional wisdom. When it comes to government race-based decisionmaking, the Constitution demands more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The dissent claims that \"the law requires application here of a standard of review that is not `strict' in the traditional sense of that word.\" <i>Post,</i> at 36. This view is informed by dissents in our previous cases and the concurrences of two Court of Appeals judges. <i>Post,</i> at 34-36 (citing 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193-1194 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring); <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> 418 F. 3d 1, 28-29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring)). Those lower court judges reasoned that programs like these are not \"aimed at oppressing blacks\" and do not \"seek to give one racial group an edge over another.\" <i>Comfort, supra,</i> at 27 (Boudin, C. J., concurring); 426 F. 3d, at 1193 (Kozinski, J., concurring). They were further persuaded that these plans differed from other race-based programs this Court has considered because they are \"certainly more benign than laws that favor or disfavor one race, segregate by race, or create quotas for or against a racial group,\" <i>Comfort,</i> 418 F. 3d, at 28 (Boudin, C. J., concurring), and they are \"far from the original evils at which the Fourteenth Amendment was addressed,\" <i>id.,</i> at 29; 426 F. 3d, at 1195 (Kozinski, J., concurring). Instead of strict scrutiny, Judge Kozinski would have analyzed the plans under \"robust and realistic rational basis review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1194.</p>\n<p>These arguments are inimical to the Constitution and to this Court's precedents.<sup>[9]</sup> We have made it unusually clear that strict scrutiny applies to <i>every</i> racial classification. <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227; <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 326; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005) (\"We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called `benign' racial classifications\").<sup>[10]</sup> There are good reasons not to apply a lesser standard to these cases. The constitutional problems with government race-based decisionmaking are not diminished in the slightest by the presence or absence of an intent to oppress any race or by the real or asserted well-meaning motives for the race-based decisionmaking. <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 228-229. Purportedly benign race-based decisionmaking suffers the same constitutional infirmity as invidious race-based decisionmaking. <i>Id.,</i> at 240 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"As far as the Constitution is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government's racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged\").</p>\n<p>Even supposing it mattered to the constitutional analysis, the race-based student assignment programs before us are not as benign as the dissent believes. See <i>post,</i> at 34-35. \"[R]acial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). As these programs demonstrate, every time the government uses racial criteria to \"bring the races together,\" <i>post,</i> at 29, someone gets excluded, and the person excluded suffers an injury solely because of his or her race. The petitioner in the Louisville case received a letter from the school board informing her that her <i>kindergartener</i> would not be allowed to attend the school of petitioner's choosing because of the child's race. App. in No. 05-915, p. 97. Doubtless, hundreds of letters like this went out from both school boards every year these racebased assignment plans were in operation. This type of exclusion, solely on the basis of race, is precisely the sort of government action that pits the races against one another, exacerbates racial tension, and \"provoke[s] resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government's use of race.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Accordingly, these plans are simply one more variation on the government race-based decisionmaking we have consistently held must be subjected to strict scrutiny. <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 326.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Though the dissent admits to discomfort in applying strict scrutiny to these plans, it claims to have nonetheless applied that exacting standard. But in its search for a compelling interest, the dissent casually accepts even the most tenuous interests asserted on behalf of the plans, grouping them all under the term \"`integration.'\" See <i>post,</i> at 37. \"`[I]ntegration,'\" we are told, has \"three essential elements.\" <i>Ibid.</i> None of these elements is compelling. And the combination of the three unsubstantiated elements does not produce an interest any more compelling than that represented by each element independently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>According to the dissent, integration involves \"an interest in setting right the consequences of prior conditions of segregation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 37. For the reasons explained above, the records in these cases do not demonstrate that either school board's plan is supported by an interest in remedying past discrimination. Part IB, <i>supra.</i> Moreover, the school boards have no interest in remedying the sundry consequences of prior segregation unrelated to schooling, such as \"housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.\" <i>Post,</i> at 38. General claims that past school segregation affected such varied societal trends are \"too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy,\" <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion), because \"[i]t is sheer speculation\" how decades-past segregation in the school system might have affected these trends, see <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 499. Consequently, school boards seeking to remedy those societal problems with race-based measures in schools today would have no way to gauge the proper scope of the remedy. <i>Id.,</i> at 498. Indeed, remedial measures geared toward such broad and unrelated societal ills have \"`no logical stopping point,'\" <i>ibid.,</i> and threaten to become \"ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future,\" <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 276 (plurality opinion). See <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 342 (stating the \"requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point\").</p>\n<p>Because the school boards lack any further interest in remedying segregation, this element offers no support for the purported interest in \"integration.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Next, the dissent argues that the interest in integration has an educational element. The dissent asserts that racially balanced schools improve educational outcomes for black children. In support, the dissent unquestioningly cites certain social science research to support propositions that are hotly disputed among social scientists. In reality, it is far from apparent that coerced racial mixing has any educational benefits, much less that integration is necessary to black achievement.</p>\n<p>Scholars have differing opinions as to whether educational benefits arise from racial balancing. Some have concluded that black students receive genuine educational benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Crain &amp; Mahard, Desegregation and Black Achievement: A Review of the Research, 42 L. &amp; Contemp. Probs. 17, 48 (1978). Others have been more circumspect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Henderson, Greenberg, Schneider, Uribe, &amp; Verdugo, High Quality Schooling for African American Students, in Beyond Desegregation 166 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996) (\"Perhaps desegregation does not have a single effect, positive or negative, on the academic achievement of African American students, but rather some strategies help, some hurt, and still others make no difference whatsoever. It is clear to us that focusing simply on demographic issues detracts from focusing on improving schools\"). And some have concluded that there are no demonstrable educational benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Armor &amp; Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line: New Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in America 239, 251 (A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom eds. 2002).</p>\n<p>The <i>amicus</i> briefs in the cases before us mirror this divergence of opinion. Supporting the school boards, one <i>amicus</i> has assured us that \"both early desegregation research and recent statistical and econometric analyses. . . indicate that there are positive effects on minority student achievement scores arising from diverse school settings.\" Brief for American Educational Research Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10. Another brief claims that \"school desegregation has a modest positive impact on the achievement of African-American students.\" App. to Brief for 553 Social Scientists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 13-14 (footnote omitted). Yet neither of those briefs contains specific details like the magnitude of the claimed positive effects or the precise demographic mix at which those positive effects begin to be realized. Indeed, the social scientists' brief rather cautiously claims the existence of any benefit at all, describing the \"positive impact\" as \"modest,\" <i>id.,</i> at 13, acknowledging that \"there appears to be little or no effect on math scores,\" <i>id.,</i> at 14, and admitting that the \"underlying reasons for these gains in achievement are not entirely clear,\" <i>id.,</i> at 15.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Other <i>amici</i> dispute these findings. One <i>amicus</i> reports that \"[i]n study after study, racial composition of a student body, when isolated, proves to be an insignificant determinant of student achievement.\" Brief for Dr. John Murphy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> in No. 05-908, p. 8; see also <i>id.,</i> at 9 (\"[T]here is no evidence that diversity in the K-12 class-room positively affects student achievement\"). Another <i>amicus</i> surveys several social science studies and concludes that \"a fair and comprehensive analysis of the research shows that there is no clear and consistent evidence of [educational] benefits.\" Brief for David J. Armor et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 29.</p>\n<p>Add to the inconclusive social science the fact of black achievement in \"racially isolated\" environments. See T. Sowell, Education: Assumptions Versus History 7-38 (1986). Before <i>Brown,</i> the most prominent example of an exemplary black school was Dunbar High School. <i>Id.,</i> at 29 (\"[I]n the period 1918-1923, Dunbar graduates earned fifteen degrees from Ivy League colleges, and ten degrees from Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan\"). Dunbar is by no means an isolated example. See <i>id.,</i> at 10-32 (discussing other successful black schools); Walker, Can Institutions Care?

Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study 141-165 (2004). Even after <i>Brown,</i> some schools with predominantly black enrollments have achieved outstanding educational results. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. Carter, No Excuses: Lessons from 21 High-Performing, High-Poverty Schools 49-50, 53-56, 71-73, 81-84, 87-88 (2001); A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom, No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning 43-64 (2003); see also L. Izumi, They Have Overcome: HighP-overty, High-Performing Schools in California (2002) (chronicling exemplary achievement in predominantly Hispanic schools in California). There is also evidence that black students attending historically black colleges achieve better academic results than those attending predominantly white colleges. <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 364-365 (in part and concurring in judgment) (citing sources); see also <i>Fordice,</i> 505 U. S., at 748-749 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The Seattle school board itself must believe that racial mixing is not necessary to black achievement. Seattle operates a K-8 \"African-American Academy,\" which has a \"nonwhite\" enrollment of 99%. See App. in No. 05-908, p. 227a; Reply Brief in No. 05-908, p. 13, n. 13. That school was founded in 1990 as part of the school board's effort to \"increase academic achievement.\"<sup>[12]</sup> See African American Academy History, online at http://www. seattleschools.org/schools/aaa/history.htm (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). According to the school's most recent annual report, \"[a]cademic excellence\" is its \"primary goal.\" See African American Academy 2006 Annual Report, p. 2, online at http://www.seattleschools.org/area/ siso/reports/anrep/altern/938.pdf. This racially imbalanced environment has reportedly produced test scores \"higher across all grade levels in reading, writing and math.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Contrary to what the dissent would have predicted, see <i>post,</i> at 38-39, the children in Seattle's African American Academy have shown gains when placed in a \"highly segregated\" environment.</p>\n<p>Given this tenuous relationship between forced racial mixing and improved educational results for black children, the dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educational element supports the integration interest, let alone makes it compelling.<sup>[13]</sup> See <i>Jenkins,</i> 515 U. S., at 121-122 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\"[T]here is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment\").</p>\n<p>Perhaps recognizing as much, the dissent argues that the social science evidence is \"strong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.\" <i>Post,</i> at 38. This assertion is inexplicable. It is not up to the school boardsthe very government entities whose race-based practices we must strictly scrutinizeto determine what interests qualify as compelling under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rather, this Court must assess independently the nature of the interest asserted and the evidence to support it in order to determine whether it qualifies as compelling under our precedents. In making such a determination, we have deferred to state authorities only once, see <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 328-330, and that deference was prompted by factors uniquely relevant to higher education. <i>Id.,</i> at 328 (\"Our holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions\"). The dissent's proposed testwhether sufficient social science evidence supports a government unit's conclusion that the interest it asserts is compellingcalls to mind the rational-basis standard of review the dissent purports not to apply, <i>post,</i> at 36-37. See <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</i> 348 U. S. 483, 488 (1955) (\"It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it\"). Furthermore, it would leave our equal-protection jurisprudence at the mercy of elected government officials evaluating the evanescent views of a handful of social scientists. To adopt the dissent's deferential approach would be to abdicate our constitutional responsibilities.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Finally, the dissent asserts a \"democratic element\" to the integration interest. It defines the \"democratic element\" as \"an interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the `pluralistic society' in which our children will live.\" <i>Post,</i> at 39.<sup>[15]</sup> Environmental reflection, though, is just another way to say racial balancing. And \"[p]referring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake.\" <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \"This the Constitution forbids.\" <i>Ibid.; </i><i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 329-330; <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 494.</p>\n<p>Navigating around that inconvenient authority, the dissent argues that the racial balancing in these plans is not an end in itself but is instead intended to \"teac[h] children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 39-40. These \"generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship\" are too sweeping to qualify as compelling interests. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 348 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). And they are not \"uniquely relevant\" to schools or \"uniquely `teachable' in a formal educational setting.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 347. Therefore, if governments may constitutionally use racial balancing to achieve these aspirational ends in schools, they may use racial balancing to achieve similar goals at every levelfrom state-sponsored 4-H clubs, see <i>Bazemore</i> v. <i>Friday,</i> 478 U. S. 385, 388-390 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring), to the state civil service. See <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S. 347-348 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the democratic interest has no durational limit, contrary to <i>Grutter</i>'s command. See <i>id.,</i> at 342; see also <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 498; <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 275 (plurality opinion). In other words, it will always be important for students to learn cooperation among the races. If this interest justifies race-conscious measures today, then logically it will justify race-conscious measures forever. Thus, the democratic interest, limitless in scope and \"timeless in [its] ability to affect the future,\" <i>id.,</i> at 276 (plurality opinion), cannot justify government race-based decisionmaking.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to these defects, the democratic element of the integration interest fails on the dissent's own terms. The dissent again relies upon social science research to support the proposition that state-compelled racial mixing teaches children to accept cooperation and improves racial attitudes and race relations. Here again, though, the dissent overstates the data that supposedly support the interest.</p>\n<p>The dissent points to data that indicate that \"black and white students in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those in segregated schools.\" <i>Post,</i> at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted). By the dissent's account, improvements in racial attitudes depend upon the increased contact between black and white students thought to occur in more racially balanced schools. There is no guarantee, however, that students of different races in the same school will actually spend time with one another. Schools frequently group students by academic ability as an aid to efficient instruction, but such groupings often result in classrooms with high concentrations of one race or another. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Yonezawa, Wells, &amp; Serna, Choosing Tracks: \"Freedom of Choice\" in Detracting Schools, 39 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 1, p. 38 (Spring 2002); Mickelson, Subverting Swann: First- and Second-Generation Segregation in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 38 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 2, pp. 233-234 (Summer 2001) (describing this effect in schools in Charlotte, North Carolina). In addition to classroom separation, students of different races within the same school may separate themselves socially. See Hallinan &amp; Williams, Interracial Friendship Choices in Secondary Schools, 54 Am. Sociological Rev., No. 1, pp. 72-76 (Feb. 1989); see also Clotfelter, Interracial Contact in High School Extracurricular Activities, 34 Urban Rev., No. 1, pp. 41-43 (Mar. 2002). Therefore, even supposing interracial contact leads directly to improvements in racial attitudes and race relations, a program that assigns students of different races to the same schools might not capture those benefits. Simply putting students together under the same roof does not necessarily mean that the students will learn together or even interact.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is unclear whether increased interracial contact improves racial attitudes and relations.<sup>[17]</sup> One researcher has stated that \"the reviews of desegregation and intergroup relations were unable to come to any conclusion about what the probable effects of desegregation were . . . [;] virtually all of the reviewers determined that few, if any, firm conclusions about the impact of desegregation on intergroup relations could be drawn.\" Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations: A Review of the Literature, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. Grant ed. 1991). Some studies have even found that a deterioration in racial attitudes seems to result from racial mixing in schools. See N. St. John, School Desegregation Outcomes for Children 67-68 (1975) (\"A glance at [the data] shows that for either race positive findings are less common than negative findings\"); Stephan, The Effects of School Desegregation: An Evaluation 30 Years After Brown, in Advances in Applied Social Psychology 183-186 (M. Saks &amp; L. Saxe eds. 1986). Therefore, it is not nearly as apparent as the dissent suggests that increased interracial exposure automatically leads to improved racial attitudes or race relations.</p>\n<p>Given our case law and the paucity of evidence supporting the dissent's belief that these plans improve race relations, no democratic element can support the integration interest.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4</h2>\n<p>The dissent attempts to buttress the integration interest by claiming that it follows <i>a fortiori</i> from the interest this Court recognized as compelling in <i>Grutter. Post,</i> at 41. Regardless of the merit of <i>Grutter,</i> the compelling interest recognized in that case cannot support these plans. <i>Grutter</i> recognized a compelling interest in a law school's attainment of a diverse student body. 539 U. S., at 328. This interest was critically dependent upon features unique to higher education: \"the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment,\" the \"special niche in our constitutional tradition\" occupied by universities, and \"[t]he freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education[,] includ[ing] the selection of its student body.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted). None of these features is present in elementary and secondary schools. Those schools do not select their own students, and education in the elementary and secondary environment generally does not involve the free interchange of ideas thought to be an integral part of higher education. See 426 F. 3d, at 1208 (Bea, J., dissenting). Extending <i>Grutter</i> to this context would require us to cut that holding loose from its theoretical moorings. Thus, only by ignoring <i>Grutter</i>'s reasoning can the dissent claim that recognizing a compelling interest in these cases is an <i>a fortiori</i> application of <i>Grutter.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Stripped of the baseless and novel interests the dissent asserts on their behalf, the school boards cannot plausibly maintain that their plans further a compelling interest. As I explained in <i>Grutter,</i> only \"those measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy . . . or to prevent violence\" and \"a government's effort to remedy past discrimination for which it is responsible\" constitute compelling interests. 539 U. S., at 351-352, 353. Neither of the parties has arguednor could theythat race-based student assignment is necessary to provide a bulwark against anarchy or to prevent violence. And as I explained above, the school districts have no remedial interest in pursuing these programs. See Part IB, <i>supra.</i> Accordingly, the school boards cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. These plans are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Most of the dissent's criticisms of today's result can be traced to its rejection of the color-blind Constitution. See <i>post,</i> at 29. The dissent attempts to marginalize the notion  of a color-blind Constitution by consigning it to me and Members of today's plurality.<sup>[19]</sup> See <i>ibid.;</i> see also <i>post,</i> at 61. But I am quite comfortable in the company I keep. My view of the Constitution is Justice Harlan's view in <i>Plessy:</i> \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\" <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (dissenting opinion). And my view was the rallying cry for the lawyers who litigated <i>Brown.</i> See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellants in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, Nos. 1, 2, and 4 p. 65 (\"That the Constitution is color blind is our dedicated belief\"); Brief for Appellants in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1952, No. 1, p. 5 (\"The Fourteenth Amendment precludes a state from imposing distinctions or classifications based upon race and color alone\");<sup>[20]</sup> see also In Memoriam: Honorable Thurgood Marshall, Proceedings of the Bar and Officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, X (1993) (remarks of Judge Motley) (\"Marshall had a `Bible' to which he turned during his most depressed moments. The `Bible' would be known in the legal community as the first Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent in <i>Plessy </i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S. 537, 552 (1896). I do not know of any opinion which buoyed Marshall more in his pre-<i>Brown</i> days . . .\").</p>\n<p>The dissent appears to pin its interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause to current societal practice and expectations, deference to local officials, likely practical consequences, and reliance on previous statements from this and other courts. Such a view was ascendant in this Court's jurisprudence for several decades. It first appeared in <i>Plessy,</i> where the Court asked whether a state law providing for segregated railway cars was \"a reasonable regulation.\" 163 U. S., at 550. The Court deferred to local authorities in making its determination, noting that in inquiring into reasonableness \"there must necessarily be a large discretion on the part of the legislature.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court likewise paid heed to societal practices, local expectations, and practical consequences by looking to \"the established usages, customs and traditions of the people, and with a view to the promotion of their comfort, and the preservation of the public peace and good order.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Guided by these principles, the Court concluded: \"[W]e cannot say that a law which authorizes or even requires the separation of the two races in public conveyances is unreasonable, or more obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment than the acts of Congress requiring separate schools for colored children in the District of Columbia.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 550-551.</p>\n<p>The segregationists in <i>Brown</i> embraced the arguments the Court endorsed in <i>Plessy.</i> Though <i>Brown</i> decisively rejected those arguments, today's dissent replicates them to a distressing extent. Thus, the dissent argues that \"[e]ach plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 47. Similarly, the segregationists made repeated appeals to societal practice and expectation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <i>Briggs</i> v. <i>Elliott</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 2, p. 76 (\"[A] State has power to establish a school system which is capable of efficient administration, taking into account local problems and conditions\").<sup>[21]</sup> The dissent argues that \"weight [must be given] to a local school board's knowledge, expertise, and concerns,\" <i>post,</i> at 48, and with equal vigor, the segregationists argued for deference to local authorities. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Kansas on Reargument in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 1, p. 14 (\"We advocate only a concept of constitutional law that permits determinations of state and local policy to be made on state and local levels. We defend only the validity of the statute that enables the Topeka Board of Education to determine its own course\").<sup>[22]</sup> The dissent argues that today's decision \"threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation,\" <i>post,</i> at 2, and claims that today's decision \"risks serious harm to the law and for the Nation,\" <i>post,</i> at 65. The segregationists also relied upon the likely practical consequences of ending the state-imposed system of racial separation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <i>Davis</i> v. <i>County School Board,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 3, p. 37 (\"Yet a holding that school segregation by race violates the Constitution will result in upheaval in all of those places not now subject to Federal judicial scrutiny. This Court has made many decisions of widespread effect; none would affect more people more directly in more fundamental interests and, in fact, cause more chaos in local government than a reversal of the decision in this case\").<sup>[23]</sup> And foreshadowing today's dissent, the segregationists most heavily relied upon judicial precedent. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <i>Briggs</i> v. <i>Elliott</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 2, p. 59 (\"[I]t would be difficult indeed to find a case so favored by precedent as is the case for South Carolina here\").<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>The similarities between the dissent's arguments and the segregationists' arguments do not stop there. Like the dissent, the segregationists repeatedly cautioned the Court to consider practicalities and not to embrace too theoretical a view of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[25]</sup> And just as the dissent argues that the need for these programs will lessen over time, the segregationists claimed that reliance on segregation was lessening and might eventually end.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>What was wrong in 1954 cannot be right today.<sup>[27]</sup> Whatever else the Court's rejection of the segregationists' arguments in <i>Brown</i> might have established, it certainly made clear that state and local governments cannot take from the Constitution a right to make decisions on the basis of race by adverse possession. The fact that state and local governments had been discriminating on the basis of race for a long time was irrelevant to the <i>Brown</i> Court. The fact that racial discrimination was preferable to the relevant communities was irrelevant to the <i>Brown</i> Court. And the fact that the state and local governments had relied on statements in this Court's opinions was irrelevant to the <i>Brown</i> Court. The same principles guide today's decision. None of the considerations trumpeted by the dissent is relevant to the constitutionality of the school boards' race-based plans because no contextual detailor collection of contextual details, <i>post,</i> at 2-22-can \"provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 240 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p>In place of the color-blind Constitution, the dissent would permit measures to keep the races together and proscribe measures to keep the races apart.<sup>[29]</sup> See <i>post,</i> at 28-34, 64-65. Although no such distinction is apparent in the Fourteenth Amendment, the dissent would constitutionalize today's faddish social theories that embrace that distinction. The Constitution is not that malleable. Even if current social theories favor classroom racial engineering as necessary to \"solve the problems at hand,\" <i>post,</i> at 21, the Constitution enshrines principles independent of social theories. See <i>Plessy,</i> 163 U. S., at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\"The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time . . . . But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens.. . . Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\"). Indeed, if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories.<sup>[30]</sup> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dred Scott</i> v. <i>Sandford,</i> 19 How. 393, 407 (1857) (\"[T]hey [members of the \"negro African race\"] had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\"). Can we really be sure that the racial theories that motivated <i>Dred Scott</i> and <i>Plessy</i> are a relic of the past or that future theories will be nothing But beneficent and progressive? That is a gamble I am unwilling to take, and it is one the Constitution does not allow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The plans before us base school assignment decisions on students' race. Because \"[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens,\" such race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional. <i>Plessy, supra,</i> at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting). I concur in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion so holding.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The Nation's schools strive to teach that our strength comes from people of different races, creeds, and cultures uniting in commitment to the freedom of all. In these cases two school districts in different parts of the country seek to teach that principle by having classrooms that reflect the racial makeup of the surrounding community. That the school districts consider these plans to be necessary should remind us our highest aspirations are yet unfulfilled. But the solutions mandated by these school districts must themselves be lawful. To make race matter now so that it might not matter later may entrench the very prejudices we seek to overcome. In my view the state-mandated racial classifications at issue, official labels proclaiming the race of all persons in a broad class of citizenselementary school students in one case, high school students in anotherare unconstitutional as the cases now come to us.</p>\n<p>I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that we have jurisdiction to decide the cases before us and join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. I also join Parts IIIA and IIIC for reasons provided below. My views do not allow me to join the balance of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, which seems to me to be inconsistent in both its approach and its implications with the history, meaning, and reach of the Equal Protection Clause. JUSTICE BREYER's dissenting opinion, on the other hand, rests on what in my respectful submission is a misuse and mistaken interpretation of our precedents. This leads it to advance propositions that, in my view, are both erroneous and in fundamental conflict with basic equal protection principles. As a consequence, this separate opinion is necessary to set forth my conclusions in the two cases before the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The opinion of the Court and JUSTICE BREYER's dissenting opinion (hereinafter dissent) describe in detail the history of integration efforts in Louisville and Seattle. These plans classify individuals by race and allocate benefits and burdens on that basis; and as a result, they are to be subjected to strict scrutiny. See <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 543 U. S. 499, 505-506 (2005); <i>ante,</i> at 11. The dissent finds that the school districts have identified a compelling interest in increasing diversity, including for the purpose of avoiding racial isolation. See <i>post,</i> at 37-45. The plurality, by contrast, does not acknowledge that the school districts have identified a compelling interest here. See <i>ante,</i> at 17-25. For this reason, among others, I do not join Parts IIIB and IV. Diversity, depending on its meaning and definition, is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue.</p>\n<p>It is well established that when a governmental policy is subjected to strict scrutiny, \"the government has the burden of proving that racial classifications `are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.'\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 505 (quoting <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995)). \"Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are `benign' or `remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\" <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U. S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion). And the inquiry into less restrictive alternatives demanded by the narrow tailoring analysis requires in many cases a thorough understanding of how a plan works. The government bears the burden of justifying its use of individual racial classifications. As part of that burden it must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual student's race are made in a challenged governmental program. The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Crystal Meredith challenges the district's decision to deny her son Joshua McDonald a requested transfer for his kindergarten enrollment. The district concedes it denied his request \"under the guidelines,\" which is to say, on the basis of Joshua's race. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, p. 10; see also App. in No. 05-915, p. 97. Yet the district also maintains that the guidelines do not apply to \"kindergartens,\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 4, and it fails to explain the discrepancy. Resort to the record, including the parties' Stipulation of Facts, further confuses the matter. See App. in No. 05-915, at 43 (\"Transfer applications can be denied because of lack of available space or, for students in grades other than Primary 1 (kindergarten), the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan\"); <i>id.,</i> at 29 (\"The student assignment plan does not apply to . . . students in Primary 1\"); see also Stipulation of Facts in No. 3:02-CV-00620-JGH; Doc. 32, Exh. 44, p. 6 (2003-04 Jefferson County Public Schools Elementary Student Assignment Application, Section B) (\"Assignment is made to a school for Primary 1 (Kindergarten) through Grade Five as long as racial guidelines are maintained. If the Primary 1 (Kindergarten) placement does not enhance racial balance, a new application must be completed for Primary 2 (Grade One)\").</p>\n<p>The discrepancy identified is not some simple and straightforward error that touches only upon the peripheries of the district's use of individual racial classifications. To the contrary, Jefferson County in its briefing has explained how and when it employs these classifications only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 4-10. While it acknowledges that racial classifications are used to make certain assignment decisions, it fails to make clear, for example, who makes the decisions; what if any oversight is employed; the precise circumstances in which an assignment decision will or will not be made on the basis of race; or how it is determined which of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given race-based decision. See <i>ibid.</i>; see also App. in No. 05-915, at 38, 42 (indicating that decisions are \"based on . . . the racial guidelines\" without further explanation); <i>id.,</i> at 81 (setting forth the blanket mandate that \"[s]chools shall work cooperatively with each other and with central office to ensure that enrollment at all schools [in question] is within the racial guidelines annually and to encourage that the enrollment at all schools progresses toward the midpoint of the guidelines\"); <i>id.,</i> at 43, 76-77, 81-83; <i>McFarland</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Public Schools,</i> 330 F. Supp. 2d 834, 837-845, 855-862 (WD Ky. 2004).</p>\n<p>When litigation, as here, involves a \"complex, comprehensive plan that contains multiple strategies for achieving racially integrated schools,\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 4, these ambiguities become all the more problematic in light of the contradictions and confusions that result. Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-915, at 37 (\"Each [Jefferson County] school . . . has a designated geographic attendance area, which is called the `resides area' of the school[, and each] such school is the `resides school' for those students whose parent's or guardian's residence address is within the school's geographic attendance area\"); <i>id.,</i> at 82 (\"All elementary students . . . shall be assigned to the school which serves the area in which they reside\"); and Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 5 (\"There are no selection criteria for admission to [an elementary school student's] resides school, except attainment of the appropriate age and completion of the previous grade\"), with App. in No. 05-915, at 38 (\"Decisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the [elementary] schools and the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan\"); <i>id.,</i> at 82 (acknowledging that a student may not be assigned to his or her resides school if it \"has reached . . . the extremes of the racial guidelines\").</p>\n<p>One can attempt to identify a construction of Jefferson County's student assignment plan that, at least as a logical matter, complies with these competing propositions; but this does not remedy the underlying problem. Jefferson County fails to make clear to this Courteven in the limited respects implicated by Joshua's initial assignment and transfer denialwhether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and <i>ad hoc</i> manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest. When a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the State.</p>\n<p>As for the Seattle case, the school district has gone further in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions on the basis of individual racial classifications. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents in No. 05908, p. 5-11. The district, nevertheless, has failed to make an adequate showing in at least one respect. It has failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of races, with fewer than half of the students classified as \"white,\" it has employed the crude racial categories of \"white\" and \"non-white\" as the basis for its assignment decisions. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 1-11.</p>\n<p>The district has identified its purposes as follows: \"(1) to promote the educational benefits of diverse school enrollments; (2) to reduce the potentially harmful effects of racial isolation by allowing students the opportunity to opt out of racially isolated schools; and (3) to make sure that racially segregated housing patterns did not prevent non-white students from having equitable access to the most popular over-subscribed schools.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 19. Yet the school district does not explain how, in the context of its diverse student population, a blunt distinction between \"white\" and \"non-white\" furthers these goals. As the Court explains, \"a school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent AsianA-merican, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 15-16; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in No. 05-908, pp. 13-14. Far from being narrowly tailored to its purposes, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the school district has provided no convincing explanation for its design. Other problems are evident in Seattle's system, but there is no need to address them now. As the district fails to account for the classification system it has chosen, despite what appears to be its ill fit, Seattle has not shown its plan to be narrowly tailored to achieve its own ends; and thus it fails to pass strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our Nation from the inception has sought to preserve and expand the promise of liberty and equality on which it was founded. Today we enjoy a society that is remarkable in its openness and opportunity. Yet our tradition is to go beyond present achievements, however significant, and to recognize and confront the flaws and injustices that remain. This is especially true when we seek assurance that opportunity is not denied on account of race. The enduring hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that too often it does.</p>\n<p>This is by way of preface to my respectful submission that parts of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE imply an all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when, in my view, it may be taken into account. The plurality opinion is too dismissive of the legitimate interest government has in ensuring all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race. The plurality's postulate that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" <i>ante,</i> at 40-41, is not sufficient to decide these cases. Fifty years of experience since <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483 (1954), should teach us that the problem before us defies so easy a solution. School districts can seek to reach <i>Brown</i>'s objective of equal educational opportunity. The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of <i>de facto</i> resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion. To the extent the plurality opinion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and local school authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly mistaken.</p>\n<p>The statement by Justice Harlan that \"[o]ur Constitution is color-blind\" was most certainly justified in the context of his dissent in <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896). The Court's decision in that case was a grievous error it took far too long to overrule. <i>Plessy,</i> of course, concerned official classification by race applicable to all persons who sought to use railway carriages. And, as an aspiration, Justice Harlan's axiom must command our assent. In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot be a universal constitutional principle.</p>\n<p>In the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition. Cf. <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 306 (2003); <i>id.,</i> at 387-388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). If school authorities are concerned that the student-body compositions of certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an equal educational opportunity to all of their students, they are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic, individual typing by race.</p>\n<p>School boards may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race. These mechanisms are race conscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a classification that tells each student he or she is to be defined by race, so it is unlikely any of them would demand strict scrutiny to be found permissible. See <i>Bush</i> v. <i>Vera,</i> 517 U. S. 952, 958 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\"Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race. . . . Electoral district lines are `facially race neutral' so a more searching inquiry is necessary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable in redistricting cases than in cases of `classifications based explicitly on race'\" (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 213)). Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races. Assigning to each student a personal designation according to a crude system of individual racial classifications is quite a different matter; and the legal analysis changes accordingly.</p>\n<p>Each respondent has asserted that its assignment of individual students by race is permissible because there is no other way to avoid racial isolation in the school districts. Yet, as explained, each has failed to provide the support necessary for that proposition. Cf. <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 501 (\"The history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis\"). And individual racial classifications employed in this manner may be considered legitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compelling interest. See <i>id.,</i> at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>In the cases before us it is noteworthy that the number of students whose assignment depends on express racial classifications is limited. I join Part IIIC of the Court's opinion because I agree that in the context of these plans, the small number of assignments affected suggests that the schools could have achieved their stated ends through different means. These include the facially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics that might include race as a component. The latter approach would be informed by <i>Grutter,</i> though of course the criteria relevant to student placement would differ based on the age of the students, the needs of the parents, and the role of the schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The dissent rests on the assumptions that these sweeping race-based classifications of persons are permitted by existing precedents; that its confident endorsement of race categories for each child in a large segment of the community presents no danger to individual freedom in other, prospective realms of governmental regulation; and that the racial classifications used here cause no hurt or anger of the type the Constitution prevents. Each of these premises is, in my respectful view, incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The dissent's reliance on this Court's precedents to justify the explicit, sweeping, classwide racial classifications at issue here is a misreading of our authorities that, it appears to me, tends to undermine well-accepted principles needed to guard our freedom. And in his critique of that analysis, I am in many respects in agreement with THE CHIEF JUSTICE. The conclusions he has set forth in Part IIIA of the Court's opinion are correct, in my view, because the compelling interests implicated in the cases before us are distinct from the interests the Court has recognized in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination and in increasing diversity in higher education. See <i>ante,</i> at 12-13. As the Court notes, we recognized the compelling nature of the interest in remedying past intentional discrimination in <i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> 503 U. S. 467, 494 (1992), and of the interest in diversity in higher education in <i>Grutter.</i> At the same time, these compelling interests, in my view, do help inform the present inquiry. And to the extent the plurality opinion can be interpreted to foreclose consideration of these interests, I disagree with that reasoning.</p>\n<p>As to the dissent, the general conclusions upon which it relies have no principled limit and would result in the broad acceptance of governmental racial classifications in areas far afield from schooling. The dissent's permissive strict scrutiny (which bears more than a passing resemblance to rational-basis review) could invite widespread governmental deployment of racial classifications. There is every reason to think that, if the dissent's rationale were accepted, Congress, assuming an otherwise proper exercise of its spending authority or commerce power, could mandate either the Seattle or the Jefferson County plans nationwide. There seems to be no principled rule, moreover, to limit the dissent's rationale to the context of public schools. The dissent emphasizes local control, see <i>post,</i> at 48-49, the unique history of school desegregation, see <i>post,</i> at 2, and the fact that these plans make less use of race than prior plans, see <i>post,</i> at 57, but these factors seem more rhetorical than integral to the analytical structure of the opinion.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the dissent's reliance on the Court's opinions in <i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 244 (2003), and <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S. 306<i>.</i> If today's dissent said it was adhering to the views expressed in the separate opinions in <i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter,</i> see <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U. S., at 281 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 282 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 291 (SOUTER, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 298 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 344 (GINSBURG, J., concurring), that would be understandable, and likely within the traditionto be invoked, in my view, in rare instancesthat permits us to maintain our own positions in the face of <i>stare decisis</i> when fundamental points of doctrine are at stake. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Federal Maritime Comm'n</i> v. <i>South Carolina Ports Authority,</i> 535 U. S. 743, 770 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). To say, however, that we must ratify the racial classifications here at issue based on the majority opinions in <i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter</i> is, with all respect, simply baffling.</p>\n<p><i>Gratz</i> involved a system where race was not the entire classification. The procedures in <i>Gratz</i> placed much less reliance on race than do the plans at issue here. The issue in <i>Gratz</i> arose, moreover, in the context of college admissions where students had other choices and precedent supported the proposition that First Amendment interests give universities particular latitude in defining diversity. See <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265, 312-314 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Even so the race factor was found to be invalid. <i>Gratz, supra,</i> at 251. If <i>Gratz</i> is to be the measure, the racial classification systems here are <i>a fortiori</i> invalid. If the dissent were to say that college cases are simply not applicable to public school systems in kindergarten through high school, this would seem to me wrong, but at least an arguable distinction. Under no fair reading, though, can the majority opinion in <i>Gratz</i> be cited as authority to sustain the racial classifications under consideration here.</p>\n<p>The same must be said for the controlling opinion in <i>Grutter.</i> There the Court sustained a system that, it found, was flexible enough to take into account \"all pertinent elements of diversity,\" 539 U. S., at 341 (internal quotation marks omitted), and considered race as only one factor among many, <i>id.,</i> at 340. Seattle's plan, by contrast, relies upon a mechanical formula that has denied hundreds of students their preferred schools on the basis of three rigid criteria: placement of siblings, distance from schools, and race. If those students were considered for a whole range of their talents and school needs with race as just one consideration, <i>Grutter</i> would have some application. That, though, is not the case. The only support today's dissent can draw from <i>Grutter</i> must be found in its various separate opinions, not in the opinion filed for the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>To uphold these programs the Court is asked to brush aside two concepts of central importance for determining the validity of laws and decrees designed to alleviate the hurt and adverse consequences resulting from race discrimination. The first is the difference between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation; the second, the presumptive invalidity of a State's use of racial classifications to differentiate its treatment of individuals. In the immediate aftermath of <i>Brown</i> the Court addressed other instances where laws and practices enforced <i>de jure</i> segregation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1 (1967) (marriage); <i>New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn.</i> v. <i>Detiege,</i> 358 U. S. 54 (1958) <i>(per curiam)</i> (public parks); <i>Gayle</i> v. <i>Browder,</i> 352 U. S. 903 (1956) <i>(per curiam)</i> (buses); <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> 350 U. S. 879 (1955) <i>(per curiam)</i> (golf courses); <i>Mayor of Baltimore</i> v. <i>Dawson,</i> 350 U. S. 877 (1955) <i>(per curiam)</i> (beaches). But with reference to schools, the effect of the legal wrong proved most difficult to correct. To remedy the wrong, school districts that had been segregated by law had no choice, whether under court supervision or pursuant to voluntary desegregation efforts, but to resort to extraordinary measures including individual student and teacher assignment to schools based on race. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S. 1, 8-10 (1971); see also <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that racial classifications \"may be the only adequate remedy after a judicial determination that a State or its instrumentality has violated the Equal Protection Clause\"). So it was, as the dissent observes, see <i>post,</i> at 1314, that Louisville classified children by race in its school assignment and busing plan in the 1970's.</p>\n<p>Our cases recognized a fundamental difference between those school districts that had engaged in <i>de jure</i> segregation and those whose segregation was the result of other factors. School districts that had engaged in <i>de jure</i> segregation had an affirmative constitutional duty to desegregate; those that were <i>de facto</i> segregated did not. Compare <i>Green</i> v. <i>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,</i> 391 U. S. 430, 437-438 (1968), with <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 418 U. S. 717, 745 (1974). The distinctions between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation extended to the remedies available to governmental units in addition to the courts. For example, in <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> 476 U. S. 267, 274 (1986), the plurality noted: \"This Court never has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification. Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.\" The Court's decision in <i>Croson, supra,</i> reinforced the difference between the remedies available to redress <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To accept [a] claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for `remedial relief' for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 505-506.</blockquote>\n<p>From the standpoint of the victim, it is true, an injury stemming from racial prejudice can hurt as much when the demeaning treatment based on race identity stems from bias masked deep within the social order as when it is imposed by law. The distinction between government and private action, furthermore, can be amorphous both as a historical matter and as a matter of present-day finding of fact. Laws arise from a culture and vice versa. Neither can assign to the other all responsibility for persisting injustices.</p>\n<p>Yet, like so many other legal categories that can overlap in some instances, the constitutional distinction between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation has been thought to be an important one. It must be conceded its primary function in school cases was to delimit the powers of the Judiciary in the fashioning of remedies. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Milliken, supra,</i> at 746. The distinction ought not to be altogether disregarded, however, when we come to that most sensitive of all racial issues, an attempt by the government to treat whole classes of persons differently based on the government's systematic classification of each individual by race. There, too, the distinction serves as a limit on the exercise of a power that reaches to the very verge of constitutional authority. Reduction of an individual to an assigned racial identity for differential treatment is among the most pernicious actions our government can undertake. The allocation of governmental burdens and benefits, contentious under any circumstances, is even more divisive when allocations are made on the basis of individual racial classifications. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265 (1978); <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S. 200.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these concerns, allocation of benefits and burdens through individual racial classifications was found sometimes permissible in the context of remedies for <i>de jure</i> wrong. Where there has been <i>de jure</i> segregation, there is a cognizable legal wrong, and the courts and legislatures have broad power to remedy it. The remedy, though, was limited in time and limited to the wrong. The Court has allowed school districts to remedy their prior <i>de jure</i> segregation by classifying individual students based on their race. See <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S. 43, 45-46 (1971). The limitation of this power to instances where there has been <i>de jure</i> segregation serves to confine the nature, extent, and duration of governmental reliance on individual racial classifications.</p>\n<p>The cases here were argued upon the assumption, and come to us on the premise, that the discrimination in question did not result from <i>de jure</i> actions. And when <i>de facto</i> discrimination is at issue our tradition has been that the remedial rules are different. The State must seek alternatives to the classification and differential treatment of individuals by race, at least absent some extraordinary howing not present here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The dissent refers to an opinion filed by Judge Kozinski in one of the cases now before us, and that opinion relied upon an opinion filed by Chief Judge Boudin in a case presenting an issue similar to the one here. See <i>post,</i> at 35 (citing 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193-1196 (CA9 2005) (concurring opinion) (citing <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> 418 F. 3d 1, 27-29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring))). Though this may oversimplify the matter a bit, one of the main concerns underlying those opinions was this: If it is legitimate for school authorities to work to avoid racial isolation in their schools, must they do so only by indirection and general policies? Does the Constitution mandate this inefficient result? Why may the authorities not recognize the problem in candid fashion and solve it altogether through resort to direct assignments based on student racial classifications? So, the argument proceeds, if race is the problem, then perhaps race is the solution.</p>\n<p>The argument ignores the dangers presented by individual classifications, dangers that are not as pressing when the same ends are achieved by more indirect means. When the government classifies an individual by race, it must first define what it means to be of a race. Who exactly is white and who is nonwhite? To be forced to live under a state-mandated racial label is inconsistent with the dignity of individuals in our society. And it is a label that an individual is powerless to change. Governmental classifications that command people to march in different directions based on racial typologies can cause a new divisiveness. The practice can lead to corrosive discourse, where race serves not as an element of our diverse heritage but instead as a bargaining chip in the political process. On the other hand race-conscious measures that do not rely on differential treatment based on individual classifications present these problems to a lesser degree.</p>\n<p>The idea that if race is the problem, race is the instrument with which to solve it cannot be accepted as an analytical leap forward. And if this is a frustrating duality of the Equal Protection Clause it simply reflects the duality of our history and our attempts to promote freedom in a world that sometimes seems set against it. Under our Constitution the individual, child or adult, can find his own identity, can define her own persona, without state intervention that classifies on the basis of his race or the color of her skin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children. A compelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an interest that a school district, in its discretion and expertise, may choose to pursue. Likewise, a district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population. Race may be one component of that diversity, but other demographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered. What the government is not permitted to do, absent a showing of necessity not made here, is to classify every student on the basis of race and to assign each of them to schools based on that classification. Crude measures of this sort threaten to reduce children to racial chits valued and traded according to one school's supply and another's demand.</p>\n<p>That statement, to be sure, invites this response: A sense of stigma may already become the fate of those separated out by circumstances beyond their immediate control. But to this the replication must be: Even so, measures other than differential treatment based on racial typing of individuals first must be exhausted.</p>\n<p>The decision today should not prevent school districts from continuing the important work of bringing together students of different racial, ethnic, and economic back-grounds. Due to a variety of factorssome influenced by government, some notneighborhoods in our communities do not reflect the diversity of our Nation as a whole. Those entrusted with directing our public schools can bring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, administrators, and other concerned citizens to find a way to achieve the compelling interests they face without resorting to widespread governmental allocation of benefits and burdens on the basis of racial classifications.</p>\n<p>With this explanation I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>While I join JUSTICE BREYER's eloquent and unanswerable dissent in its entirety, it is appropriate to add these words.</p>\n<p>There is a cruel irony in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's reliance on our decision in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 349 U. S. 294 (1955). The first sentence in the concluding paragraph of his opinion states: \"Before <i>Brown,</i> schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 40. This sentence reminds me of Anatole France's observation: \"[T]he majestic equality of the la[w], forbid[s] rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.\"<sup>[1]</sup> THE CHIEF JUSTICE fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools.<sup>[2]</sup> In this and other ways, THE CHIEF JUSTICE rewrites the history of one of this Court's most important decisions. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 39 (\"history will be heard\"), with <i>Brewer</i> v. <i>Quarterman,</i> 550 U. S. ___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 11) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (\"It is a familiar adage that history is written by the victors\").</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE rejects the conclusion that the racial classifications at issue here should be viewed differently than others, because they do not impose burdens on one race alone and do not stigmatize or exclude.<sup>[3]</sup> The only justification for refusing to acknowledge the obvious importance of that difference is the citation of a few recent opinionsnone of which even approached unanimity grandly proclaiming that all racial classifications must be analyzed under \"strict scrutiny.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995). Even today, two of our wisest federal judges have rejected such a wooden reading of the Equal Protection Clause in the context of school integration. See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193-1196 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring); <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> 418 F. 3d 1, 27-29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring). The Court's misuse of the three-tiered approach to Equal Protection analysis merely reconfirms my own view that there is only one such Clause in the Constitution. See <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren,</i> 429 U. S. 190, 211 (1976) (concurring opinion).<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>If we look at cases decided during the interim between <i>Brown</i> and <i>Adarand,</i> we can see how a rigid adherence to tiers of scrutiny obscures <i>Brown</i>'s clear message. Perhaps the best example is provided by our approval of the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in 1967 upholding a state statute mandating racial integration in that State's school system. See <i>School Comm. of </i> <i>Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 352 Mass. 693, 227 N. E. 2d 729.<sup>[5]</sup> Rejecting arguments comparable to those that the plurality accepts today,<sup>[6]</sup> that court noted: \"It would be the height of irony if the racial imbalance act, enacted as it was with the laudable purpose of achieving equal educational opportunities, should, by prescribing school pupil allocations based on race, founder on unsuspected shoals in the Fourteenth Amendment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 698, 227 N. E. 2d, at 733 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Invoking our mandatory appellate jurisdiction,<sup>[7]</sup> the Boston plaintiffs prosecuted an appeal in this Court. Our ruling on the merits simply stated that the appeal was \"dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.\" <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 389 U. S. 572 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>.</i> That decision not only expressed our appraisal of the merits of the appeal, but it constitutes a precedent that the Court overrules today. The subsequent statements by the unanimous Court in <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971), by then-Justice Rehnquist in chambers in <i>Bustop, Inc.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.,</i> 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978), and by the host of state court decisions cited by JUSTICE BREYER, see <i>post,</i> 25-27,<sup>[8]</sup> were fully consistent with that disposition. Unlike today's decision, they were also entirely loyal to <i>Brown.</i></p>\n<p>The Court has changed significantly since it decided <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> in 1968. It was then more faithful to <i>Brown</i> and more respectful of our precedent than it is today. It is my firm conviction that no Member of the Court that I joined in 1975 would have agreed with today's decision.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JUSTICE SOUTER, and JUSTICE GINSBURG join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>These cases consider the longstanding efforts of two local school boards to integrate their public schools. The school board plans before us resemble many others adopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary schools throughout the Nation. All of those plans represent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially integrated education that <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483 (1954), long ago promisedefforts that this Court has repeatedly required, permitted, and encouraged local authorities to undertake. This Court has recognized that the public interests at stake in such cases are \"compelling.\" We have approved of \"narrowly tailored\" plans that are no less race-conscious than the plans before us. And we have understood that the Constitution <i>permits</i> local communities to adopt desegregation plans even where it does not <i>require</i> them to do so.</p>\n<p>The plurality pays inadequate attention to this law, to past opinions' rationales, their language, and the contexts in which they arise. As a result, it reverses course and reaches the wrong conclusion. In doing so, it distorts precedent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of racerelated litigation, and it undermines <i>Brown</i>'s promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality. This cannot be justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Facts</i></h2>\n<p>The historical and factual context in which these cases arise is critical. In <i>Brown,</i> this Court held that the government's segregation of schoolchildren by race violates the Constitution's promise of equal protection. The Court emphasized that \"education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.\" 347 U. S., at 493. And it thereby set the Nation on a path toward public school integration.</p>\n<p>In dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school districts previously segregated by law what they must do at a minimum to comply with <i>Brown</i>'s constitutional holding. The measures required by those cases often included race-conscious practices, such as mandatory busing and race-based restrictions on voluntary transfers. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Columbus Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Penick,</i> 443 U. S. 449, 455, n. 3 (1979); <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile Cty.,</i> 402 U. S. 33, 37-38 (1971); <i>Green</i> v. <i>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,</i> 391 U. S. 430, 441-442 (1968).</p>\n<p>Beyond those minimum requirements, the Court left much of the determination of how to achieve integration to the judgment of local communities. Thus, in respect to race-conscious desegregation measures that the Constitution <i>permitted,</i> but did not <i>require</i> (measures similar to those at issue here), this Court unanimously stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. <i>To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.</i>\" <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, different districtssome acting under court decree, some acting in order to avoid threatened lawsuits, some seeking to comply with federal administrative orders, some acting purely voluntarily, some acting after federal courts had dissolved earlier ordersadopted, modified, and experimented with hosts of different kinds of plans, including race-conscious plans, all with a similar objective: greater racial integration of public schools. See F. Welch &amp; A. Light, New Evidence on School Desegregation v (1987) (hereinafter Welch) (prepared for the Commission on Civil Rights) (reviewing a sample of 125 school districts, constituting 20% of national public school enrollment, that had experimented with nearly 300 different plans over 18 years). The techniques that different districts have employed range \"from voluntary transfer programs to mandatory reassignment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 21. And the design of particular plans has been \"dictated by both the law and the specific needs of the district.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial integration. More recently, however, progress has stalled. Between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending a school where minority children constituted more than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the Nation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed direction by the year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the Nation (from 57% to 69% in the South). Similarly, between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending schools that were more than 90% minority fell from 64% to 33% in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the South), but that too reversed direction, rising by the year 2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from 23% to 31% in the South). As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or over 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools with a white population of less than 1%. Of these, 2.3 million were black and Latino students, and only 72,000 were white. Today, more than one in six black children attend a school that is 99-100% minority. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> In light of the evident risk of a return to school systems that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated, many school districts have felt a need to maintain or to extend their integration efforts.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that myriad school districts operating in myriad circumstances have devised myriad plans, often with race-conscious elements, all for the sake of eradicating earlier school segregation, bringing about integration, or preventing retrogression. Seattle and Louisville are two such districts, and the histories of their present plans set forth typical school integration stories.</p>\n<p>I describe those histories at length in order to highlight three important features of these cases. First, the school districts' plans serve \"compelling interests\" and are \"narrowly tailored\" on any reasonable definition of those terms. Second, the distinction between <i>de jure</i> segregation (caused by school systems) and <i>de facto</i> segregation (caused, <i>e.g.,</i> by housing patterns or generalized societal discrimination) is meaningless in the present context, thereby dooming the plurality's endeavor to find support for its views in that distinction. Third, real-world efforts to substitute racially diverse for racially segregated schools (however caused) are complex, to the point where the Constitution cannot plausibly be interpreted to rule out categorically all local efforts to use means that are \"conscious\" of the race of individuals.</p>\n<p>In both Seattle and Louisville, the local school districts began with schools that were highly segregated in fact. In both cities plaintiffs filed lawsuits claiming unconstitutional segregation. In Louisville, a federal district court found that school segregation reflected pre-<i>Brown</i> state laws separating the races. In Seattle, the plaintiffs alleged that school segregation unconstitutionally reflected not only generalized societal discrimination and residential housing patterns, but also <i>school board policies and actions</i> that had helped to create, maintain, and aggravate racial segregation. In Louisville, a federal court entered a remedial decree. In Seattle, the parties settled after the school district pledged to undertake a desegregation plan. In both cities, the school boards adopted plans designed to achieve integration by bringing about more racially diverse schools. In each city the school board modified its plan several times in light of, for example, hostility to busing, the threat of resegregation, and the desirability of introducing greater student choice. And in each city, the school boards' plans have evolved over time in ways that progressively <i>diminish</i> the plans' use of explicit race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>The histories that follow set forth these basic facts. They are based upon numerous sources, which for ease of exposition I have cataloged, along with their corresponding citations, at Appendix B, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Seattle</i></h2>\n<p><i>1. Segregation, 1945 to 1956.</i> During and just after World War II, significant numbers of black Americans began to make Seattle their home. Few black residents lived outside the central section of the city. Most worked at unskilled jobs. Although black students made up about 3% of the total Seattle population in the mid-1950's, nearly all black children attended schools where a majority of the population was minority. Elementary schools in central Seattle were between 60% and 80% black; Garfield, the central district high school, was more than 50% minority; schools outside the central and southeastern sections of Seattle were virtually all white.</p>\n<p><i>2. Preliminary Challenges, 1956 to 1969.</i> In 1956, a memo for the Seattle School Board reported that school segregation reflected not only segregated housing patterns but also school board policies that permitted white students to transfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer of black students into white schools. In 1958, black parents whose children attended Harrison Elementary School (with a black student population of over 75%) wrote the Seattle board, complaining that the \"`boundaries for the Harrison Elementary School were not set in accordance with the long-established standards of the School District . . . but were arbitrarily set with an end to excluding colored children from McGilvra School, which is adjacent to the Harrison school district.' \"</p>\n<p>In 1963, at the insistence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other community groups, the school board adopted a new racebased transfer policy. The new policy added an explicitly racial criterion: If a place exists in a school, then, irrespective of other transfer criteria, a white student may transfer to a predominantly black school, and a black student may transfer to a predominantly white school.</p>\n<p>At that time one high school, Garfield, was about two-thirds minority; eight high schools were virtually all white. In 1963, the transfer program's first year, 239 black students and 8 white students transferred. In 1969, about 2,200 (of 10,383 total) of the district's black students and about 400 of the district's white students took advantage of the plan. For the next decade, annual program transfers remained at approximately this level.</p>\n<p><i>3. The NAACP's First Legal Challenge and Seattle's Response, 1969 to 1977.</i> In 1969 the NAACP filed a federal lawsuit against the school board, claiming that the board had \"unlawfully and unconstitutionally\" \"establish[ed]\" and \"maintain[ed]\" a system of \"racially segregated public schools.\" The complaint said that 77% of black public elementary school students in Seattle attended 9 of the city's 86 elementary schools and that 23 of the remaining schools had no black students at all. Similarly, of the 1,461 black students enrolled in the 12 senior high schools in Seattle, 1,151 (or 78.8%) attended 3 senior high schools, and 900 (61.6%) attended a single school, Garfield.</p>\n<p>The complaint charged that the school board had brought about this segregated system in part by \"mak[ing] and enforc[ing]\" certain \"rules and regulations,\" in part by \"drawing . . . boundary lines\" and \"executing school attendance policies\" that would create and maintain \"predominantly Negro or non-white schools,\" and in part by building schools \"in such a manner as to restrict the Negro plaintiffs and the class they represent to predominantly negro or non-white schools.\" The complaint also charged that the board discriminated in assigning teachers.</p>\n<p>The board responded to the lawsuit by introducing a plan that required race-based transfers and mandatory busing. The plan created three new middle schools at three school buildings in the predominantly white north end. It then created a \"mixed\" student body by assigning to those schools students who would otherwise attend predominantly white, or predominantly black, schools elsewhere. It used explicitly racial criteria in making these assignments (<i>i.e.,</i> it deliberately assigned to the new middle schools black students, not white students, from the black schools and white students, not black students, from the white schools). And it used busing to transport the students to their new assignments. The plan provoked considerable local opposition. Opponents brought a lawsuit. But eventually a state court found that the mandatory busing was lawful.</p>\n<p>In 1976-1977, the plan involved the busing of about 500 middle school students (300 black students and 200 white students). Another 1,200 black students and 400 white students participated in the previously adopted voluntary transfer program. Thus about 2,000 students out of a total district population of about 60,000 students were involved in one or the other transfer program. At that time, about 20% or 12,000 of the district's students were black. And the board continued to describe 26 of its 112 schools as \"segregated.\"</p>\n<p><i>4. The NAACP's Second Legal Challenge, 1977.</i> In 1977, the NAACP filed another legal complaint, this time with the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint alleged that the Seattle School Board had created or perpetuated unlawful racial segregation through, <i>e.g.,</i> certain school-transfer criteria, a construction program that need-lessly built new schools in white areas, district line-drawing criteria, the maintenance of inferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit racial criteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and a general pattern of delay in respect to the implementation of promised desegregation efforts.</p>\n<p>The OCR and the school board entered into a formal settlement agreement. The agreement required the board to implement what became known as the \"Seattle Plan.\"</p>\n<p><i>5. The Seattle Plan: Mandatory Busing, 1978 to 1988.</i> The board began to implement the Seattle Plan in 1978. This plan labeled \"racially imbalanced\" any school at which the percentage of black students exceeded by more than 20% the minority population of the school district as a whole. It applied that label to 26 schools, including 4 high schoolsCleveland (72.8% minority), Franklin (76.6% minority), Garfield (78.4% minority), and Rainier Beach (58.9% minority). The plan paired (or \"triaded\") \"imbalanced\" black schools with \"imbalanced\" white schools. It then placed some grades (say, third and fourth grades) at one school building and other grades (say, fifth and sixth grades) at the other school building. And it thereby required, for example, all fourth grade students from the previously black and previously white schools first to attend together what would now be a \"mixed\" fourth grade at one of the school buildings and then the next year to attend what would now be a \"mixed\" fifth grade at the other school building.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the plan provided that a previous \"black\" school would remain about 50% black, while a previous \"white\" school would remain about two-thirds white. It was consequently necessary to decide with some care <i>which</i> students would attend the new \"mixed\" grade. For this purpose, administrators cataloged the racial makeup of each neighborhood housing block. The school district met its percentage goals by assigning to the new \"mixed\" school an appropriate number of \"black\" housing blocks and \"white\" housing blocks. At the same time, transport from house to school involved extensive busing, with about half of all students attending a school other than the one closest to their home.</p>\n<p>The Seattle Plan achieved the school integration that it sought. Just prior to the plan's implementation, for example, 4 of Seattle's 11 high schools were \"imbalanced,\" <i>i.e.,</i> almost exclusively \"black\" or almost exclusively \"white.\" By 1979, only two were out of \"balance.\" By 1980 only Cleveland remained out of \"balance\" (as the board defined it) and that by a mere two students.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Seattle Plan, due to its busing, provoked serious opposition within the State. See generally <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S. 457, 461466 (1982). Thus, Washington state voters enacted an initiative that amended state law to require students to be assigned to the schools closest to their homes. <i>Id.,</i> at 462. The Seattle School Board challenged the constitutionality of the initiative. <i>Id.,</i> at 464. This Court then held that the initiativewhich would have prevented the Seattle Plan from taking effectviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 470.</p>\n<p><i>6. Student Choice, 1988 to 1998.</i> By 1988, many white families had left the school district, and many Asian families had moved in. The public school population had fallen from about 100,000 to less than 50,000. The racial makeup of the school population amounted to 43% white, 24% black, and 23% Asian or Pacific Islander, with Hispanics and Native Americans making up the rest. The cost of busing, the harm that members of all racial communities feared that the Seattle Plan caused, the desire to attract white families back to the public schools, and the interest in providing greater school choice led the board to abandon busing and to substitute a new student assignment policy that resembles the plan now before us.</p>\n<p>The new plan permitted each student to choose the school he or she wished to attend, subject to race-based constraints. In respect to high schools, for example, a student was given a list of a subset of schools, carefully selected by the board to balance racial distribution in the district by including neighborhood schools and schools in racially different neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. The student could then choose among those schools, indicating a first choice, and other choices the student found acceptable. In making an assignment to a particular high school, the district would give first preference to a student with a sibling already at the school. It gave second preference to a student whose race differed from a race that was \"over-represented\" at the school (<i>i.e.,</i> a race that accounted for a higher percentage of the school population than of the total district population). It gave third preference to students residing in the neighborhood. It gave fourth preference to students who received child care in the neighborhood. In a typical year, say, 1995, about 20,000 potential high school students participated. About 68% received their first choice. Another 16% received an \"acceptable\" choice. A further 16% were assigned to a school they had not listed.</p>\n<p><i>7. The Current Plan, 1999 to the Present.</i> In 1996, the school board adopted the present plan, which began in 1999. In doing so, it sought to deemphasize the use of racial criteria and to increase the likelihood that a student would receive an assignment at his first or second choice high school. The district retained a racial tiebreaker for oversubscribed schools, which takes effect only if the school's minority or majority enrollment falls outside of a 30% range centered on the minority/majority population ratio within the district. At the same time, all students were free subsequently to transfer from the school at which they were initially placed to a different school of their choice without regard to race. Thus, at worst, a student would have to spend one year at a high school he did not pick as a first or second choice.</p>\n<p>The new plan worked roughly as expected for the two school years during which it was in effect (1999-2000 and 2000-2001). In the 2000-2001 school year, for example, with the racial tiebreaker, the entering ninth grade class at Franklin High School had a 60% minority population; without the racial tiebreaker that same class at Franklin would have had an almost 80% minority population. (We consider only the ninth grade since only students entering that class were subject to the tiebreaker, and because the plan was not in place long enough to change the composition of an entire school.) In the year 2005-2006, by which time the racial tiebreaker had not been used for several years, Franklin's overall minority enrollment had risen to 90%. During the period the tiebreaker applied, it typically affected about 300 students per year. Between 80% and 90% of all students received their first choice assignment; between 89% and 97% received their first or second choice assignment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools objected to Seattle's most recent plan under the State and Federal Constitutions. In due course, the Washington Supreme Court, the Federal District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (sitting en banc) rejected the challenge and found Seattle's plan lawful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Louisville</i></h2>\n<p><i>1. Before the Lawsuit, 1954 to 1972.</i> In 1956, two years after <i>Brown</i> made clear that Kentucky could no longer require racial segregation by law, the Louisville Board of Education created a geography-based student assignment plan designed to help achieve school integration. At the same time it adopted an open transfer policy under which approximately 3,000 of Louisville's 46,000 students applied for transfer. By 1972, however, the Louisville School District remained highly segregated. Approximately half the district's public school enrollment was black; about half was white. Fourteen of the district's nineteen nonvocational middle and high schools were close to totally black or totally white. Nineteen of the district's forty-six elementary schools were between 80% and 100% black. Twenty-one elementary schools were between roughly 90% and 100% white.</p>\n<p><i>2. Court-Imposed Guidelines and Busing, 1972 to 1991.</i> In 1972, civil rights groups and parents, claiming unconstitutional segregation, sued the Louisville Board of Education in federal court. The original litigation eventually became a lawsuit against the Jefferson County School System, which in April 1975 absorbed Louisville's schools and combined them with those of the surrounding suburbs. (For ease of exposition, I shall still use \"Louisville\" to refer to what is now the combined districts.) After preliminary rulings and an eventual victory for the plaintiffs in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the District Court in July 1975 entered an order requiring desegregation.</p>\n<p>The order's requirements reflected a (newly enlarged) school district student population of about 135,000, approximately 20% of whom were black. The order required the school board to create and to maintain schools with student populations that ranged, for elementary schools, between 12% and 40% black, and for secondary schools (with one exception), between 12.5% and 35% black.</p>\n<p>The District Court also adopted a complex desegregation plan designed to achieve the order's targets. The plan required redrawing school attendance zones, closing 12 schools, and busing groups of students, selected by race and the first letter of their last names, to schools outside their immediate neighborhoods. The plan's initial busing requirements were extensive, involving the busing of 23,000 students and a transportation fleet that had to \"operate from early in the morning until late in the evening.\" For typical students, the plan meant busing for several years (several more years for typical black students than for typical white students). The following notice, published in a Louisville newspaper in 1976, gives a sense of how the district's race-based busing plan operated in practice:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Louisville Courier Journal, June 18, 1976 (reproduced in J. Wilkinson, From <i>Brown</i> to <i>Bakke:</i> The Supreme Court and School Integration 1954-1978, p. 176 (1979)).</p>\n<p>The District Court monitored implementation of the plan. In 1978, it found that the plan had brought all of Louisville's schools within its \"`guidelines' for racial composition\" for \"at least a substantial portion of the [previous] three years.\" It removed the case from its active docket while stating that it expected the board \"to continue to implement those portions of the desegregation order which are by their nature of a continuing effect.\"</p>\n<p>By 1984, after several schools had fallen out of compliance with the order's racial percentages due to shifting demographics in the community, the school board revised its desegregation plan. In doing so, the board created a new racial \"guideline,\" namely a \"floating range of 10% above and 10% below the countywide average for the different grade levels.\" The board simultaneously redrew district boundaries so that middle school students could attend the same school for three years and high school students for four years. It added \"magnet\" programs at two high schools. And it adjusted its alphabet-based system for grouping and busing students. The board estimated that its new plan would lead to annual reassignment (with busing) of about 8,500 black students and about 8,000 white students.</p>\n<p><i>3. Student Choice and Project Renaissance, 1991 to 1996.</i> By 1991, the board had concluded that assigning elementary school students to two or more schools during their elementary school years had proved educationally unsound and, if continued, would undermine Kentucky's newly adopted Education Reform Act. It consequently conducted a nearly year-long review of its plan. In doing so, it consulted widely with parents and other members of the local community, using public presentations, public meetings, and various other methods to obtain the public's input. At the conclusion of this review, the board adopted a new plan, called \"Project Renaissance,\" that emphasized student choice.</p>\n<p>Project Renaissance again revised the board's racial guidelines. It provided that each elementary school would have a black student population of between 15% and 50%; each middle and high school would have a black population and a white population that fell within a range, the boundaries of which were set at 15% above and 15% below the general student population percentages in the county at that grade level. The plan then drew new geographical school assignment zones designed to satisfy these guide-lines; the district could reassign students if particular schools failed to meet the guidelines and was required to do so if a school repeatedly missed these targets.</p>\n<p>In respect to elementary schools, the plan first drew a neighborhood line around each elementary school, and it then drew a second line around groups of elementary schools (called \"clusters\"). It initially assigned each student to his or her neighborhood school, but it permitted each student freely to transfer between elementary schools within each cluster <i>provided that</i> the transferring student (a) was black if transferring from a predominantly black school to a predominantly white school, or (b) was white if transferring from a predominantly white school to a predominantly black school. Students could also apply to attend magnet elementary schools or programs.</p>\n<p>The plan required each middle school student to be assigned to his or her neighborhood school unless the student applied for, and was accepted by, a magnet middle school. The plan provided for \"open\" high school enrollment. Every 9th or 10th grader could apply to any high school in the system, and the high school would accept applicants according to set criteriaone of which consisted of the need to attain or remain in compliance with the plan's racial guidelines. Finally, the plan created two new magnet schools, one each at the elementary and middle school levels.</p>\n<p><i>4. The Current Plan: Project Renaissance Modified, 1996 to 2003.</i> In 1995 and 1996, the Louisville School Board, with the help of a special \"Planning Team,\" community meetings, and other official and unofficial study groups, monitored the effects of Project Renaissance and considered proposals for improvement. Consequently, in 1996, the board modified Project Renaissance, thereby creating the present plan.</p>\n<p>At the time, the district's public school population was approximately 30% black. The plan consequently redrew the racial \"guidelines,\" setting the boundaries at 15% to 50% black for <i>all</i> schools. It again redrew school assignment boundaries. And it expanded the transfer opportunities available to elementary and middle school pupils. The plan forbade transfers, however, if the transfer would lead to a school population outside the guideline range, <i>i.e.,</i> if it would create a school where fewer than 15% or more than 50% of the students were black.</p>\n<p>The plan also established \"Parent Assistance Centers\" to help parents and students navigate the school selection and assignment process. It pledged the use of other resources in order to \"encourage all schools to achieve an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment at the school's respective elementary, middle or high school level.\" And the plan continued use of magnet schools.</p>\n<p>In 1999, several parents brought a lawsuit in federal court attacking the plan's use of racial guidelines at one of the district's magnet schools. They asked the court to dissolve the desegregation order and to hold the use of <i>magnet</i> school racial guidelines unconstitutional. The board opposed dissolution, arguing that \"the old dual system\" had left a \"demographic imbalance\" that \"prevent[ed] dissolution.\" In 2000, after reviewing the present plan, the District Court dissolved the 1975 order. It wrote that there was \"overwhelming evidence of the Board's good faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes.\" It added that the Louisville School Board had \"treated the ideal of an integrated system as much more than a legal obligationthey consider it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded public school education.\"</p>\n<p>The Court also found that the magnet programs available at the high school in question were \"not available at other high schools\" in the school district. It consequently held unconstitutional the use of race-based \"targets\" to govern admission to <i>magnet schools.</i> And it ordered the board not to control access to those scarce programs through the use of racial targets.</p>\n<p><i>5. The Current Lawsuit, 2003 to the Present.</i> Subsequent to the District Court's dissolution of the desegregation order (in 2000) the board simply continued to implement its 1996 plan as modified to reflect the court's magnet school determination. In 2003, the petitioner now before us, Crystal Meredith, brought this lawsuit challenging the plan's unmodified portions, <i>i.e.,</i> those portions that dealt with <i>ordinary,</i> not magnet, schools. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected Meredith's challenge and held the unmodified aspects of the plan constitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The histories I have set forth describe the extensive and ongoing efforts of two school districts to bring about greater racial integration of their public schools. In both cases the efforts were in part remedial. Louisville began its integration efforts in earnest when a federal court in 1975 entered a school desegregation order. Seattle undertook its integration efforts in response to the filing of a federal lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segregation complaint filed with the federal OCR. The plans in both Louisville and Seattle grow out of these earlier remedial efforts. Both districts faced problems that reflected initial periods of severe racial segregation, followed by such remedial efforts as busing, followed by evidence of resegregation, followed by a need to end busing and encourage the return of, <i>e.g.,</i> suburban students through increased student choice. When formulating the plans under review, both districts drew upon their considerable experience with earlier plans, having revised their policies periodically in light of that experience. Both districts rethought their methods over time and explored a wide range of other means, including non-race-conscious policies. Both districts also considered elaborate studies and consulted widely within their communities.</p>\n<p>Both districts sought greater racial integration for educational and democratic, as well as for remedial, reasons. Both sought to achieve these objectives while preserving their commitment to other educational goals, <i>e.g.,</i> districtwide commitment to high quality public schools, increased pupil assignment to neighborhood schools, diminished use of busing, greater student choice, reduced risk of white flight, and so forth. Consequently, the present plans expand student choice; they limit the burdens (including busing) that earlier plans had imposed upon students and their families; and they use race-conscious criteria in limited and gradually diminishing ways. In particular, they use race-conscious criteria only to mark the outer bounds of broad population-related ranges.</p>\n<p>The histories also make clear the futility of looking simply to whether earlier school segregation was <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> in order to draw firm lines separating the constitutionally permissible from the constitutionally forbidden use of \"race-conscious\" criteria. JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that it will be easy to identify <i>de jure</i> segregation because \"[i]n most cases, there either will or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the races.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 6, n. 4 (concurring opinion). But our precedent has recognized that <i>de jure</i> discrimination can be present even in the absence of racially explicit laws. See <i>Yick Wo</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> 118 U. S. 356, 373-374 (1886).</p>\n<p>No one here disputes that Louisville's segregation was <i>de jure.</i> But what about Seattle's? Was it <i>de facto? De jure?</i> A mixture? Opinions differed. Or is it that a prior federal court had not adjudicated the matter? Does that make a difference? Is Seattle free on remand to say that its schools were <i>de jure</i> segregated, just as in 1956 a memo for the School Board admitted? The plurality does not seem confident as to the answer. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 12 (opinion of the Court) (\"[T]he Seattle public schools <i>have never shown</i> that they were ever segregated by law\" (emphasis added)), with <i>ante</i> at 29-30 (plurality opinion) (assuming \"the Seattle school district was never segregated by law,\" but seeming to concede that a school district with <i>de jure</i> segregation need not be subject to a court order to be allowed to engage in race-based remedial measures).</p>\n<p>A court finding of <i>de jure</i> segregation cannot be the crucial variable. After all, a number of school districts in the South that the Government or private plaintiffs challenged as segregated <i>by law</i> voluntarily desegregated their schools <i>without a court order</i>just as Seattle did. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Coleman, Desegregation of the Public Schools in KentuckyThe Second Year After the Supreme Court's Decision, 25 J. Negro Educ. 254, 256, 261 (1956) (40 of Kentucky's 180 school districts began desegregation without court orders); Branton, Little Rock Revisited: Desegregation to Resegregation, 52 J. Negro Educ. 250, 251 (1983) (similar in Arkansas); Bullock &amp; Rodgers, Coercion to Compliance: Southern School Districts and School Desegregation Guidelines, 38 J. Politics 987, 991 (1976) (similar in Georgia); <i>McDaniel</i> v. <i>Barresi,</i> 402 U. S. 39, 40, n. 1 (1971) (Clarke County, Georgia). See also Letter from Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General, to John F. Kennedy, President (Jan. 24, 1963) (hereinafter Kennedy Report), available at http://www.gilderlehrman.org/search/collection_pdfs/05/63/ 0/05630.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (reporting successful efforts by the Government to induce voluntary desegregation).</p>\n<p>Moreover, Louisville's history makes clear that a community under a court order to desegregate might submit a race-conscious remedial plan <i>before</i> the court dissolved the order, but with every intention of following that plan even <i>after</i> dissolution. How could such a plan be lawful the day before dissolution but then become unlawful the very next day? On what legal ground can the majority rest its contrary view? But see <i>ante,</i> at 12-13, 17, n. 12.</p>\n<p>Are courts really to treat as merely <i>de facto</i> segregated those school districts that avoided a federal order by voluntarily complying with <i>Brown</i>'s requirements? See <i>id.,</i> at 12, 29-30. This Court has previously done just the opposite, permitting a race-conscious remedy without any kind of court decree. See <i>McDaniel, supra,</i> at 41. Because the Constitution emphatically does not forbid the use of race-conscious measures by districts in the South that voluntarily desegregated their schools, on what basis does the plurality claim that the law forbids Seattle to do the same? But see <i>ante,</i> at 29.</p>\n<p>The histories also indicate the complexity of the tasks and the practical difficulties that local school boards face when they seek to achieve greater racial integration. The boards work in communities where demographic patterns change, where they must meet traditional learning goals, where they must attract and retain effective teachers, where they should (and will) take account of parents' views and maintain <i>their</i> commitment to public school education, where they must adapt to court intervention, where they must encourage voluntary student and parent actionwhere they will find that their own good faith, their knowledge, and their understanding of local circumstances are always necessary but often insufficient to solve the problems at hand.</p>\n<p>These facts and circumstances help explain why in this context, as to means, the law often leaves legislatures, city councils, school boards, and voters with a broad range of choice, thereby giving \"different communities\" the opportunity to \"try different solutions to common problems and gravitate toward those that prove most successful or seem to them best to suit their individual needs.\" <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> 418 F. 3d 1, 28 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring) (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lopez,</i> 514 U. S. 549, 581 (1995) (KENNEDY, J., concurring)), cert. denied, 546 U. S. 1061 (2005).</p>\n<p>With this factual background in mind, I turn to the legal question: Does the United States Constitution prohibit these school boards from using race-conscious criteria in the limited ways at issue here?</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>The Legal Standard</i></h2>\n<p>A longstanding and unbroken line of legal authority tells us that the Equal Protection Clause permits local school boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals, even when the Constitution does not compel it. Because of its importance, I shall repeat what this Court said about the matter in <i>Swann.</i> Chief Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a case of exceptional importance, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\" 402 U. S., at 16.</blockquote>\n<p>The statement was not a technical holding in the case. But the Court set forth in <i>Swann</i> a basic principle of constitutional lawa principle of law that has found \"wide acceptance in the legal culture.\" <i>Dickerson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 526 U. S. 314, 330 (1999); <i>id.,</i> at 331, 332 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing \"`wide acceptance in the legal culture'\" as \"adequate reason not to overrule\" prior cases).</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S. 43, 45 (1971), this Court, citing <i>Swann,</i> restated the point. \"[S]chool authorities,\" the Court said, \"have wide discretion in formulating school policy, and . . . as a matter of educational policy school authorities may well conclude that some kind of racial balance in the schools is desirable quite apart from any constitutional requirements.\" ThenJ-ustice Rehnquist echoed this view in <i>Bustop, Inc.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.,</i> 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978) (opinion in chambers), making clear that he too believed that <i>Swann</i>'s statement reflected settled law: \"While I have the gravest doubts that [a state supreme court] was <i>required</i> by the United States Constitution to take the [desegregation] action that it has taken in this case, I have very little doubt that it was <i>permitted</i> by that Constitution to take such action.\" (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p>These statements nowhere suggest that this freedom is limited to school districts where court-ordered desegregation measures are also in effect. Indeed, in <i>McDaniel,</i> a case decided the same day as <i>Swann,</i> a group of parents challenged a race-conscious student assignment plan that the Clarke County School Board had <i>voluntarily</i> adopted as a remedy without a court order (though under federal agency pressurepressure Seattle also encountered). The plan required that each elementary school in the district maintain 20% to 40% enrollment of African-American students, corresponding to the racial composition of the district. See <i>Barresi</i> v. <i>Browne,</i> 226 Ga. 456, 456-459, 175 S. E. 2d 649, 650-651 (1970). This Court upheld the plan, see <i>McDaniel,</i> 402 U. S., at 41, rejecting the parents' argument that \"a person may not be <i>included</i> or <i>excluded</i> solely because he is a Negro or because he is white.\" Brief for Respondents in <i>McDaniel,</i> O. T. 1970, No. 420, p. 25.</p>\n<p>Federal authorities had claimedas the NAACP and the OCR did in Seattlethat Clarke County schools were segregated in law, not just in fact. The plurality's claim that Seattle was \"never segregated by law\" is simply not accurate. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 29, with <i>supra,</i> at 6-9. The plurality could validly claim that <i>no court</i> ever found that Seattle schools were segregated in law. But that is also true of the Clarke County schools in <i>McDaniel.</i> Unless we believe that the Constitution enforces one legal standard for the South and another for the North, this Court should grant Seattle the permission it granted Clarke County, Georgia. See <i>McDaniel,</i> 402 U. S., at 41 (\"[S]teps will almost invariably require that students be assigned `differently because of their race.' . . . Any other approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all desegregation processes.\").</p>\n<p>This Court has also held that school districts may be required by federal statute to undertake race-conscious desegregation efforts even when there is no likelihood that <i>de jure</i> segregation can be shown. In <i>Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New York</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> 444 U. S. 130, 148-149 (1979), the Court concluded that a federal statute required school districts receiving certain federal funds to remedy faculty segregation, even though in this Court's view the racial disparities in the affected schools were purely <i>de facto</i> and would not have been actionable under the Equal Protection Clause. Not even the dissenters thought the race-conscious remedial program posed a <i>constitutional</i> problem. See <i>id.,</i> at 152 (opinion of Stewart, J.). See also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles,</i> 458 U. S. 527, 535-536 (1982) (\"[S]tate courts of California continue to have an obligation under state law to order segregated school districts to use voluntary desegregation techniques, <i>whether or not there has been a finding of intentional segregation.</i> . . . [S]chool districts themselves retain a state-law obligation to take reasonably feasible steps to desegregate, and <i>they remain free to adopt reassignment and busing plans to effectuate desegregation</i>\" (emphasis added)); <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 389 U. S. 572 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i> (dismissing for want of a federal question a challenge to a voluntary statewide integration plan using express racial criteria).</p>\n<p>Lower state and federal courts had considered the matter settled and uncontroversial even before this Court decided <i>Swann.</i> Indeed, in 1968, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected an equal protection challenge to a raceconscious state law seeking to undo <i>de facto</i> segregation:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To support [their] claim, the defendants heavily rely on three Federal cases, each of which held, no State law being involved, that a local school board does not have an affirmative constitutional duty to act to alleviate racial imbalance in the schools that it did not cause. However, the question as to whether the constitution requires a local school board, or a State, to act to undo <i>de facto</i> school segregation is simply not here concerned. The issue here is whether the constitution permits, rather than prohibits, voluntary State action aimed toward reducing and eventually eliminating <i>de facto</i> school segregation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"State laws or administrative policies, directed toward the reduction and eventual elimination of <i>de facto</i> segregation of children in the schools and racial imbalance, have been approved by every high State court which has considered the issue. Similarly, the Federal courts which have considered the issue . . . have recognized that voluntary programs of local school authorities designed to alleviate <i>de facto</i> segregation and racial imbalance in the schools are not constitutionally forbidden.\" <i>Tometz</i> v. <i>Board of Ed., Waukegan School Dist. No. 6,</i> 39 Ill. 2d 593, 597-598, 237 N. E. 2d 498, 501 (1968) (citations omitted) (citing decisions from the high courts of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Jersey, California, New York, and Connecticut, and from the Courts of Appeals for the First, Second, Fourth, and Sixth Circuits).</blockquote>\n<p>See also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Offerman</i> v. <i>Nitkowski,</i> 378 F. 2d 22, 24 (CA2 1967); <i>Deal</i> v. <i>Cincinnati Bd. of Ed.,</i> 369 F. 2d 55, 61 (CA6 1966), cert. denied, 389 U.

In this respect, <i>Swann</i> was not a sharp or unexpected departure from prior rulings; it reflected a consensus that had already emerged among state and lower federal courts.</p>\n<p>If there were doubts before <i>Swann</i> was decided, they did not survive this Court's decision. Numerous state and federal courts explicitly relied upon <i>Swann</i>'s guidance for decades to follow. For instance, a Texas appeals court in 1986 rejected a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to a voluntary integration plan by explaining:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he absence of a court order to desegregate does not mean that a school board cannot exceed minimum requirements in order to promote school integration. School authorities are traditionally given broad discretionary powers to formulate and implement educational policy and may properly decide to ensure to their students the value of an integrated school experience.\" <i>Citizens for Better Ed.</i> v. <i>Goose Creek Consol. Independent School Dist.,</i> 719 S. W. 2d 350, 3523-53 (Ct. App. Tex. 1986) (citing <i>Swann</i> and <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i>), appeal dism'd for want of a substantial federal question, 484 U. S. 804 (1987).</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, in <i>Zaslawsky</i> v. <i>Bd. of Ed. of Los Angeles City Unified School Dist.,</i> 610 F. 2d 661, 662-664 (1979), the Ninth Circuit rejected a federal constitutional challenge to a school district's use of mandatory faculty transfers to ensure that each school's faculty makeup would fall within 10% of the districtwide racial composition. Like the Texas court, the Ninth Circuit relied upon <i>Swann</i> and <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> to reject the argument that \"a race-conscious plan is permissible only when there has been a judicial finding of <i>de jure</i> segregation.\" 610 F. 2d, at 663-664. See also, <i>e.g., </i><i>Darville</i> v. <i>Dade County School Bd.,</i> 497 F. 2d 1002, 1004-1006 (CA5 1974); <i>State ex rel. Citizens Against Mandatory Bussing</i> v. <i>Brooks,</i> 80 Wash. 2d 121, 128-129, 492 P. 2d 536, 541-542 (1972) (en banc), overruled on other grounds, <i>Cole</i> v. <i>Webster,</i> 103 Wash. 2d 280, 692 P. 2d 799 (1984) (en banc); <i>School Comm. of Springfield</i> v. <i>Board of Ed.,</i> 362 Mass. 417, 428-429 287 N. E. 2d 438, 447-448 (1972). These decisions illustrate well how lower courts understood and followed <i>Swann</i>'s enunciation of the relevant legal principle.</p>\n<p>Courts are not alone in accepting as constitutionally valid the legal principle that <i>Swann</i> enunciated-<i>i.e.,</i> that the government may voluntarily adopt race-conscious measures to improve conditions of race even when it is not under a constitutional obligation to do so. That principle has been accepted by every branch of government and is rooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself. Thus, Congress has enacted numerous race-conscious statutes that illustrate that principle or rely upon its validity. See, <i>e.g.,</i> 20 U. S. C. §6311(b)(2)(C)(v) (No Child Left Behind Act); §1067 <i>et seq.</i> (authorizing aid to minority institutions). In fact, without being exhaustive, I have counted 51 federal statutes that use racial classifications. I have counted well over 100 state statutes that similarly employ racial classifications. Presidential administrations for the past half-century have used and supported various race-conscious measures. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Exec. Order No. 10925, 26 Fed. Reg. 1977 (1961) (President Kennedy); Exec. Order No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965) (President Johnson); Sugrue, Breaking Through: The Troubled Origins of Affirmative Action in the Workplace, in Colorlines: Affirmative Action, Immigration, and Civil Rights Options for America 31 (Skretny ed. 2001) (describing President Nixon's lobbying for affirmative action plans, <i>e.g.,</i> the Philadelphia Plan); White, Affirmative Action's Alamo: Gerald Ford Returns to Fight Once More for Michigan, Time, Aug. 23, 1999, p. 48 (reporting on President Ford's support for affirmative action); Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. 1, 50 (2002) (describing President Carter's support for affirmation action). And during the same time, hundreds of local school districts have adopted student assignment plans that use race-conscious criteria. See Welch 83-91.</p>\n<p>That <i>Swann</i>'s legal statement should find such broad acceptance is not surprising. For <i>Swann</i> is predicated upon a well-established legal view of the Fourteenth Amendment. That view understands the basic objective of those who wrote the Equal Protection Clause as forbidding practices that lead to racial exclusion. The Amendment sought to bring into American society as full members those whom the Nation had previously held in slavery. See <i>Slaughter-House Cases,</i> 16 Wall. 36, 71 (1872) (\"[N]o one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in [all the Reconstruction amendments] . . . we mean the freedom of the slave race\"); <i>Strauder</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 303, 306 (1879) (\"[The Fourteenth Amendment] is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose; namely, securing to a race recently emancipated . . . all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy\").</p>\n<p>There is reason to believe that those who drafted an Amendment with this basic purpose in mind would have understood the legal and practical difference between the use of race-conscious criteria in defiance of that purpose, namely to keep the races apart, and the use of race-conscious criteria to further that purpose, namely to bring the races together. See generally R. Sears, A Utopian Experiment in Kentucky: Integration and Social Equality at Berea, 1866-1904 (1996) (describing federal funding, through the Freedman's Bureau, of race-conscious school integration programs). See also R. Fischer, The Segregation Struggle in Louisiana 1862-77, p. 51 (1974) (describing the use of race-conscious remedies); Harlan, Desegregation in New Orleans Public Schools During Reconstruction, 67 Am. Hist. Rev. 663, 664 (1962) (same); W. Vaughn, Schools for All: The Blacks and Public Education in the South, 1865-1877, pp. 111-116 (1974) (same). Although the Constitution almost always forbids the former, it is significantly more lenient in respect to the latter. See <i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 244, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 243 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Sometimes Members of this Court have disagreed about the degree of leniency that the Clause affords to programs designed to include. See <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Board of Education,</i> 476 U. S. 267, 274 (1986); <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> 448 U. S. 448, 507 (1980). But I can find no case in which this Court has followed JUSTICE THOMAS' \"colorblind\" approach. And I have found no case that otherwise repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to <i>exclude</i> and that which seeks to <i>include</i> members of minority races.</p>\n<p>What does the plurality say in response? First, it seeks to distinguish <i>Swann</i> and other similar cases on the ground that those cases involved remedial plans in response to <i>judicial findings</i> of <i>de jure</i> segregation. As <i>McDaniel</i> and <i>Harris</i> show, that is historically untrue. See <i>supra,</i> at 22-24. Many school districts in the South adopted segregation remedies (to which <i>Swann</i> clearly applies) without any such federal order<i>,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 19-20. See also Kennedy Report. Seattle's circumstances are not meaningfully different from those in, say, <i>McDaniel,</i> where this Court approved race-conscious remedies. Louisville's plan was created and initially adopted when a compulsory district court order was in place. And, in any event, the histories of Seattle and Louisville make clear that this distinctionbetween court-ordered and voluntary desegregationseeks a line that sensibly cannot be drawn.</p>\n<p>Second, the plurality downplays the importance of <i>Swann</i> and related cases by frequently describing their relevant statements as \"dicta.\" These criticisms, however, miss the main point. <i>Swann</i> did not hide its understanding of the law in a corner of an obscure opinion or in a footnote, unread but by experts. It set forth its view prominently in an important opinion joined by all nine Justices, knowing that it would be read and followed throughout the Nation. The basic problem with the plurality's technical \"dicta\"-based response lies in its overly theoretical approach to case law, an approach that emphasizes rigid distinctions between holdings and dicta in a way that serves to mask the radical nature of today's decision. Law is not an exercise in mathematical logic. And statements of a legal rule set forth in a judicial opinion do not always divide neatly into \"holdings\" and \"dicta.\" (Consider the legal \"status\" of Justice Powell's separate opinion in <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265 (1978).) The constitutional principle enunciated in <i>Swann,</i> reiterated in subsequent cases, and relied upon over many years, provides, and has widely been thought to provide, authoritative legal guidance. And if the plurality now chooses to reject that principle, it cannot adequately justify its retreat simply by affixing the label \"dicta\" to reasoning with which it disagrees. Rather, it must explain to the courts and to the Nation <i>why</i> it would abandon guidance set forth many years before, guidance that countless others have built upon over time, and which the law has continuously embodied.</p>\n<p>Third, a more important response is the plurality's claim that later casesin particular <i>Johnson, Adarand,</i> and <i>Grutter</i>supplanted <i>Swann.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 11-12, 31-32, n. 16, 34-35 (citing <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 227; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 543 U. S. 499, 505 (2005); <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 306, 326 (2003)). The plurality says that cases such as <i>Swann</i> and the others I have described all \"were decided before this Court definitively determined that `all racial classifications . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 31, n. 16 (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227). This Court in <i>Adarand</i> added that \"such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And the Court repeated this same statement in <i>Grutter.</i> See 539 U. S., at 326.</p>\n<p>Several of these cases were significantly more restrictive than <i>Swann</i> in respect to the degree of leniency the Fourteenth Amendment grants to programs designed to <i>include</i> people of all races. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Adarand, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Gratz, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Grutter, supra</i><i>.</i> But that legal circumstance cannot make a critical difference here for two separate reasons.</p>\n<p>First, no casenot <i>Adarand, Gratz, Grutter,</i> or any otherhas ever held that the test of \"strict scrutiny\" means that all racial classificationsno matter whether they seek to include or excludemust in practice be treated the same. The Court did not say in <i>Adarand</i> or in <i>Johnson</i> or in <i>Grutter</i> that it was overturning <i>Swann</i> or its central constitutional principle.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in its more recent opinions, the Court recognized that the \"fundamental purpose\" of strict scrutiny review is to \"take relevant differences\" between \"fundamentally different situations . . . into account.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court made clear that \"[s]trict scrutiny does not trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It added that the fact that a law \"treats [a person] unequally because of his or her race . . . says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 229-230 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court, using the very phrase that Justice Marshall had used to describe strict scrutiny's application to any <i>exclusionary</i> use of racial criteria, sought to \"<i>dispel the notion</i> that strict scrutiny\" is as likely to condemn <i>inclusive</i> uses of \"race-conscious\" criteria as it is to invalidate <i>exclusionary</i> uses. That is, it is <i>not</i> in all circumstances \"`strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 237 (quoting <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p>The Court in <i>Grutter</i> elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Strict scrutiny is not `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' . . . Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Context matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause. See <i>Gomillion</i> v. <i>Lightfoot,</i> 364 U. S. 339, 343-344 (1960) (admonishing that, `in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling facts'). . . . Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.\" 539 U. S., at 326-327.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court's holding in <i>Grutter</i> demonstrates that the Court meant what it said, for the Court upheld an elite law school's race-conscious admissions program.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the cases to which the plurality refers, though all applying strict scrutiny, do not treat exclusive and inclusive uses the same. Rather, they apply the strict scrutiny test in a manner that is \"fatal in fact\" only to racial classifications that harmfully <i>exclude;</i> they apply the test in a manner that is <i>not</i> fatal in fact to racial classifications that seek to <i>include.</i></p>\n<p>The plurality cannot avoid this simple fact. See <i>ante,</i> at 34-36. Today's opinion reveals that the plurality would rewrite this Court's prior jurisprudence, at least in practical application, transforming the \"strict scrutiny\" test into a rule that is fatal in fact across the board. In doing so, the plurality parts company from this Court's prior cases, and it takes from local government the longstanding legal right to use race-conscious criteria for inclusive purposes in limited ways.</p>\n<p>Second, as <i>Grutter</i> specified, \"[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\" 539 U. S., at 327 (citing <i>Gomillion</i> v. <i>Lightfoot,</i> 364 U. S. 339, 343-344 (1960)). And contexts differ dramatically one from the other. Governmental use of race-based criteria can arise in the context of, for example, census forms, research expenditures for diseases, assignments of police officers patrolling predominantly minority-race neighborhoods, efforts to desegregate racially segregated schools, policies that favor minorities when distributing goods or services in short supply, actions that create majority-minority electoral districts, peremptory strikes that remove potential jurors on the basis of race, and others. Given the significant differences among these contexts, it would be surprising if the law required an identically strict legal test for evaluating the constitutionality of race-based criteria as to each of them.</p>\n<p>Here, the context is one in which school districts seek to advance or to maintain racial integration in primary and secondary schools. It is a context, as <i>Swann</i> makes clear, where history has required special administrative remedies. And it is a context in which the school boards' plans simply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries of a broad range.</p>\n<p>This context is <i>not</i> a context that involves the use of race to decide who will receive goods or services that are normally distributed on the basis of merit and which are in short supply. It is not one in which race-conscious limits stigmatize or exclude; the limits at issue do not pit the races against each other or otherwise significantly exacerbate racial tensions. They do not impose burdens unfairly upon members of one race alone but instead seek benefits for members of all races alike. The context here is one of racial limits that seek, not to keep the races apart, but to bring them together.</p>\n<p>The importance of these differences is clear once one compares the present circumstances with other cases where one or more of these negative features are present. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Strauder</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> 100 U. S. 303 (1880); <i>Yick Wo</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> 118 U. S. 356 (1886); <i>Brown,</i> 347 U. S. 483; <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1 (1967); <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S. 265 (1978); <i>Batson</i> v. <i>Kentucky,</i> 476 U. S. 79 (1986); <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> 488 U. S. 469 (1989); <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno,</i> 509 U. S. 630 (1993); <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200 (1995); <i>Grutter, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 244 (2003); <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 543 U. S. 499 (2005).</p>\n<p>If one examines the context more specifically, one finds that the districts' plans reflect efforts to overcome a history of segregation, embody the results of broad experience and community consultation, seek to expand student choice while reducing the need for mandatory busing, and use race-conscious criteria in highly limited ways that diminish the use of race compared to preceding integration efforts. Compare <i>Wessmann</i> v. <i>Gittens,</i> 160 F. 3d 790, 809-810 (CA1 1998) (Boudin, J., concurring), with <i>Comfort,</i> 418 F. 3d, at 28-29 (Boudin, C. J., concurring). They do not seek to award a scarce commodity on the basis of merit, for they are not magnet schools; rather, by design and in practice, they offer substantially equivalent academic programs and electives. Although some parents or children prefer some schools over others, school popularity has varied significantly over the years. In 2000, for example, Roosevelt was the most popular first choice high school in Seattle; in 2001, Ballard was the most popular; in 2000, West Seattle was one of the least popular; by 2003, it was one of the more popular. See Research, Evaluation and Assessment, Student Information Services Office, District Summaries 1999-2005, available at http://www.seattleschools.org/area/siso/disprof/2005/DP05 all.pdf. In a word, the school plans under review do not involve the kind of race-based harm that has led this Court, in other contexts, to find the use of race-conscious criteria unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>These and related considerations convinced one Ninth Circuit judge in the Seattle case to apply a standard of constitutionality review that is less than \"strict,\" and to conclude that this Court's precedents do not require the contrary. See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1193-1194 (2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (\"That a student is denied the school of his choice may be disappointing, but it carries no racial stigma and says nothing at all about that individual's aptitude or ability\"). That judge is not alone. Cf. <i>Gratz, supra,</i> at 301 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 243 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Carter, When Victims Happen To Be Black, 97 Yale L. J. 420, 433-434 (1988).</p>\n<p>The view that a more lenient standard than \"strict scrutiny\" should apply in the present context would not imply abandonment of judicial efforts carefully to determine the need for race-conscious criteria and the criteria's tailoring in light of the need. And the present context requires a court to examine carefully the race-conscious program at issue. In doing so, a reviewing judge must be fully aware of the potential dangers and pitfalls that JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE KENNEDY mention. See <i>ante,</i> at 11-12 (THOMAS, J., concurring); <i>ante,</i> at 3, 17 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p>But unlike the plurality, such a judge would also be aware that a legislature or school administrators, ultimately accountable to the electorate, could <i>nonetheless</i> properly conclude that a racial classification sometimes serves a purpose important enough to overcome the risks they mention, for example, helping to end racial isolation or to achieve a diverse student body in public schools. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 17-18 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Where that is so, the judge would carefully examine the program's details to determine whether the use of race-conscious criteria is proportionate to the important ends it serves.</p>\n<p>In my view, this contextual approach to scrutiny is altogether fitting. I believe that the law requires application here of a standard of review that is not \"strict\" in the traditional sense of that word, although it does require the careful review I have just described. See <i>Gratz, supra,</i> at 301 (GINSBURG, J., joined by SOUTER, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 242-249 (STEVENS, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., dissenting); 426 F. 3d, at 1193-1194 (Kozinski, J., concurring). Apparently JUSTICE KENNEDY also agrees that strict scrutiny would not apply in respect to certain \"race-conscious\" school board policies. See <i>ante,</i> at 9 (\"Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races\").</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in light of <i>Grutter</i> and other precedents, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 290 (opinion of Powell, J.), I shall adopt the first alternative. I shall apply the version of strict scrutiny that those cases embody. I shall consequently ask whether the school boards in Seattle and Louisville adopted these plans to serve a \"compelling governmental interest\" and, if so, whether the plans are \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve that interest. If the plans survive this strict review, they would survive less exacting review <i>a fortiori.</i> Hence, I conclude that the plans before us pass both parts of the strict scrutiny test. Consequently I must conclude that the plans here are permitted under the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Applying the Legal Standard</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Compelling Interest</i></h2>\n<p>The principal interest advanced in these cases to justify the use of race-based criteria goes by various names. Sometimes a court refers to it as an interest in achieving racial \"diversity.\" Other times a court, like the plurality here, refers to it as an interest in racial \"balancing.\" I have used more general terms to signify that interest, describing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or preserving greater racial \"integration\" of public schools. By this term, I mean the school districts' interest in eliminating school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the degree to which racial mixture characterizes each of the district's schools and each individual student's public school experience.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its name, however, the interest at stake possesses three essential elements. First, there is a historical and remedial element: an interest in setting rightthe consequences of prior conditions of segregation. This refers back to a time when public schools were highly segregated, often as a result of legal or administrative policies that facilitated racial segregation in public schools. It is an interest in continuing to combat the remnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by these school-related policies, which have often affected not only schools, but also housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes. It is an interest in maintaining hard-won gains. And it has its roots in preventing what gradually may become the <i>de facto</i> resegregation of America's public schools. See Part I, <i>supra,</i> at 4; Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> See also <i>ante,</i> at 17 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (\"This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children\").</p>\n<p>Second, there is an educational element: an interest in overcoming the adverse educational effects produced by and associated with highly segregated schools. Cf. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S.<i>,</i> at 345 (GINSBURG, J., concurring). Studies suggest that children taken from those schools and placed in integrated settings often show positive academic gains. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Powell, Living and Learning: Linking Housing and Education, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy 15, 35 (J. Powell, G. Kearney, &amp; V. Kay eds. 2001) (hereinafter Powell); Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social Science Evidence, 59 Ohio St. L. J. 733, 741-742 (1998) (hereinafter Hallinan).</p>\n<p>Other studies reach different conclusions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> D. Armor, Forced Justice (1995). See also <i>ante,</i> at 15-17 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But the evidence supporting an educational interest in racially integrated schools is well established and strong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.</p>\n<p>Research suggests, for example, that black children from segregated educational environments significantly increase their achievement levels once they are placed in a more integrated setting. Indeed in Louisville itself the achievement gap between black and white elementary school students grew substantially smaller (by seven percentage points) after the integration plan was implemented in 1975. See Powell 35. Conversely, to take another example, evidence from a district in Norfolk, Virginia, shows that resegregated schools led to a decline in the achievement test scores of children of all races. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>One commentator, reviewing dozens of studies of the educational benefits of desegregated schooling, found that the studies have provided \"remarkably consistent\" results, showing that: (1) black students' educational achievement is improved in integrated schools as compared to racially isolated schools, (2) black students' educational achievement is improved in integrated classes, and (3) the earlier that black students are removed from racial isolation, the better their educational outcomes. See Hallinan 741-742. Multiple studies also indicate that black alumni of integrated schools are more likely to move into occupations traditionally closed to African-Americans, and to earn more money in those fields. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Schofield, Review of Research on School Desegregation's Impact on Elementary and Secondary School Students, in Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education 597, 606-607 (J. Banks &amp; C. Banks eds. 1995). Cf. W. Bowen &amp; D. Bok, The Shape of the River 118 (1998) (hereinafter Bowen &amp; Bok).</p>\n<p>Third, there is a democratic element: an interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the \"pluralistic society\" in which our children will live. <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 16. It is an interest in helping our children learn to work and play together with children of different racial backgrounds. It is an interest in teaching children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.</p>\n<p>Again, data support this insight. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hallinan 745; Quillian &amp; Campbell, Beyond Black and White: The Present and Future of Multiracial Friendship Segregation, 68 Am. Sociological Rev. 540, 541 (2003) (hereinafter Quillian &amp; Campbell); Dawkins &amp; Braddock, The Continuing Significance of Desegregation: School Racial Composition and African American Inclusion in American Society, 63 J. Negro Ed. 394, 401-403 (1994) (hereinafter Dawkins &amp; Braddock); Wells &amp; Crain, Perpetuation Theory and the Long-Term Effects of School Desegregation, 64 Rev. Educational Research 531, 550 (1994) (hereinafter Wells &amp; Crain).</p>\n<p>There are again studies that offer contrary conclusions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. Grant ed. 1991). See also <i>ante,</i> at 22-23 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Again, however, the evidence supporting a democratic interest in racially integrated schools is firmly established and sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine, as this Court has itself often found, that this interest is compelling.</p>\n<p>For example, one study documented that \"black and white students in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those in segregated schools,\" and that \"interracial contact in desegregated schools leads to an increase in interracial sociability and friendship.\" Hallinan 745. See also Quillian &amp; Campbell 541. Cf. Bowen &amp; Bok 155. Other studies have found that both black and white students who attend integrated schools are more likely to work in desegregated companies after graduation than students who attended racially isolated schools. Dawkins &amp; Braddock 401-403; Wells &amp; Crain 550. Further research has shown that the desegregation of schools can help bring adult communities together by reducing segregated housing. Cities that have implemented successful school desegregation plans have witnessed increased interracial contact and neighborhoods that tend to become less racially segregated. Dawkins &amp; Braddock 403. These effects not only reinforce the prior gains of integrated primary and secondary education; they also foresee a time when there is less need to use race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this Court from <i>Swann</i> to <i>Grutter</i> has treated these civic effects as an important virtue of racially diverse education. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann, supra,</i> at 16; <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S., at 472-473. In <i>Grutter,</i> in the context of law school admissions, we found that these types of interests were, constitutionally speaking, \"compelling.\" See 539 U. S., at 330 (recognizing that Michigan Law School's race-conscious admissions policy \"promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand persons of different races,\" and pointing out that \"the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints\" (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>In light of this Court's conclusions in <i>Grutter,</i> the \"compelling\" nature of these interests in the context of primary and secondary public education follows here <i>a fortiori.</i> Primary and secondary schools are where the education of this Nation's children begins, where each of us begins to absorb those values we carry with us to the end of our days. As Justice Marshall said, \"unless our children begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> 418 U. S. 717, 783 (1974) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>And it was <i>Brown,</i> after all, focusing upon primary and secondary schools, not <i>Sweatt</i> v. <i>Painter,</i> 339 U. S. 629 (1950), focusing on law schools, or <i>McLaurin</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i> <i>State Regents for Higher Ed.,</i> 339 U. S. 637 (1950), focusing on graduate schools, that affected so deeply not only Americans but the world. R. Kluger, Simple Justice: The History of <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> and Black America's Struggle for Equality, p. x (1975) (arguing that perhaps no other Supreme Court case has \"affected more directly the minds, hearts, and daily lives of so many Americans\"); Patterson, <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> xxvii (2001) (identifying <i>Brown</i> as \"the most eagerly awaited and dramatic judicial decision of modern times\"). See also <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> 426 F. 3d, at 1194 (Kozinski, J., concurring); Strauss, Discriminatory Intent and the Taming of <i>Brown,</i> 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 935, 937 (1989) (calling <i>Brown</i> \"the Supreme Court's greatest anti-discrimination decision\"); Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in <i>Brown,</i> 347 U. S. 483; Dudziak, <i>Brown</i> as a Cold War Case, 91 J. Am. Hist. 32 (2004); A Great Decision, Hindustan Times (New Dehli, May 20, 1954), p. 5; USA Takes Positive Step, West African Pilot (Lagos, May 22, 1954), p. 2 (stating that <i>Brown</i> is an acknowledgment that the \"United States should set an example for all other nations by taking the lead in removing from its national life all signs and traces of racial intolerance, arrogance or discrimination\"). Hence, I am not surprised that JUSTICE KENNEDY finds that, \"a district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population,\" including a <i>racially</i> diverse population. <i>Ante,</i> at 17-18.</p>\n<p>The compelling interest at issue here, then, includes an effort to eradicate the remnants, not of general \"societal discrimination,\" <i>ante,</i> at 23 (plurality opinion), but of primary and secondary school segregation, see <i>supra,</i> at 7, 14; it includes an effort to create school environments that provide better educational opportunities for all children; it includes an effort to help create citizens better prepared to know, to understand, and to work with people of all races and backgrounds, thereby furthering the kind of democratic government our Constitution foresees. If an educational interest that combines these three elements is not \"compelling,\" what is?</p>\n<p>The majority acknowledges that in prior cases this Court has recognized at least two interests as compelling: an interest in \"remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination,\" and an interest in \"diversity in higher education.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 12, 13. But the plurality does not convincingly explain why those interests do not constitute a \"compelling interest\" here. How do the remedial interests here differ in kind from those at issue in the voluntary desegregation efforts that Attorney General Kennedy many years ago described in his letter to the President? <i>Supra,</i> at 19-20. How do the educational and civic interests differ in kind from those that underlie and justify the racial \"diversity\" that the law school sought in <i>Grutter,</i> where this Court found a compelling interest?</p>\n<p>The plurality tries to draw a distinction by reference to the well-established conceptual difference between <i>de jure</i> segregation (\"segregation by state action\") and <i>de facto</i> segregation (\"racial imbalance caused by other factors\"). <i>Ante,</i> at 28. But that distinction concerns what the Constitution <i>requires</i> school boards to do, not what it <i>permits</i> them to do. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Green,</i> 391 U. S., at 437-438 (\"School boards . . . operating state-compelled dual systems\" have an \"affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system inw hich racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch\"), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>Milliken,</i> 418 U. S., at 745 (the Constitution does not impose a duty to desegregate upon districts that have not been \"shown to have committed any constitutional violation\").</p>\n<p>The opinions cited by the plurality to justify its reliance upon the <i>de jure/de facto</i> distinction only address what remedial measures a school district may be constitutionally <i>required</i> to undertake. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> 503 U. S. 467, 495 (1992). As to what is <i>permitted,</i> nothing in our equal protection law suggests that a State may right only those wrongs that it committed. No case of this Court has ever relied upon the <i>de jure/de facto</i> distinction in order to limit what a school district is voluntarily allowed to do. That is what is at issue here. And <i>Swann, McDaniel, Crawford, North Carolina Bd. of Ed., Harris,</i> and <i>Bustop</i> made one thing clear: significant as the difference between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation may be to the question of what a school district <i>must</i> do, that distinction is not germane to the question of what a school district <i>may</i> do.</p>\n<p>Nor does any precedent indicate, as the plurality suggests with respect to Louisville, <i>ante,</i> at 29, that remedial interests vanish the day after a federal court declares that a district is \"unitary.\" Of course, Louisville adopted those portions of the plan at issue here <i>before</i> a court declared Louisville \"unitary.\" Moreover, in <i>Freeman,</i> this Court pointed out that in \"one sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by state decree do remain in our society and in our schools. Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs committed by the State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of history. And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.\" 503 U. S., at 495. See also <i>ante,</i> at 15 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). I do not understand why this Court's cases, which rest the significance of a \"unitary\" finding in part upon the wisdom and desirability of returning schools to local control, should deprive those local officials of legal <i>permission</i> to use means they once found necessary to combat persisting injustices.</p>\n<p>For his part, JUSTICE THOMAS faults my citation of various studies supporting the view that school districts can find compelling educational and civic interests in integrating their public schools. See <i>ante,</i> at 15-17, 23 (concurring opinion). He is entitled of course to his own opinion as to which studies he finds convincingalthough it bears mention that even the author of some of JUSTICE THOMAS' preferred studies has found <i>some</i> evidence linking integrated learning environments to increased academic achievement. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 15-17 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing Armor &amp; Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line 239 (A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom eds. 2002); Brief for Armor <i>et al.</i> as <i>Amici Curiae,</i> with Rosen, Perhaps Not All Affirmative Action is Created Equal, N. Y. Times, June 11, 2006 (quoting David Armor as commenting \"`[w]e did find the [racial] achievement gap changing <i>significantly</i>'\" and acknowledging that he \"`did find a modest association for math but not reading in terms of racial composition and achievement, but there's a big state variation'\" (emphasis added)). If we are to insist upon unanimity in the social science literature before finding a compelling interest, we might never find one. I believe only that the Constitution allows democratically elected school boards to make up their own minds as to how best to include people of all races in one America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Narrow Tailoring</i></h2>\n<p>I next ask whether the plans before us are \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve these \"compelling\" objectives. I shall not accept the school board's assurances on faith, cf. <i>Miller </i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> 515 U. S. 900, 920 (1995), and I shall subject the \"tailoring\" of their plans to \"rigorous judicial review.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Several factors, taken together, nonetheless lead me to conclude that the boards' use of race-conscious criteria in these plans passes even the strictest \"tailoring\" test.</p>\n<p>First, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set the outer bounds of <i>broad</i> ranges. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 390 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (expressing concern about \"narrow fluctuation band[s]\"). They constitute but one part of plans that depend primarily upon other, nonracial elements. To use race in this way is not to set a forbidden \"quota.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 335 (\"Properly understood, a `quota' is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are `reserved exclusively for certain minority groups'\" (quoting <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 496)).</p>\n<p>In fact, the defining feature of both plans is greater emphasis upon student choice. In Seattle, for example, in more than 80% of all cases, that choice alone determines which high schools Seattle's ninth graders will attend. After ninth grade, students can decide voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of race-conscious criteria). <i>Choice,</i> therefore, is the \"predominant factor\" in these plans. <i>Race</i> is not. See <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 393 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (allowing consideration of race only if it does \"not become a predominant factor\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, the race-conscious ranges at issue in these cases often have no effect, either because the particular school is not oversubscribed in the year in question, or because the racial makeup of the school falls within the broad range, or because the student is a transfer applicant or has a sibling at the school. In these respects, the broad ranges are less like a quota and more like the kinds of \"useful starting points\" that this Court has consistently found permissible, even when they set boundaries upon voluntary transfers, and even when they are based upon a community's general population. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S. 43, 46 (1971) (no \"absolute prohibition against [the] use\" of mathematical ratios as a \"starting point\"); <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 24-25 (approving the use of a ratio reflecting \"the racial composition of the whole school system\" as a \"useful starting point,\" but not as an \"inflexible requirement\"). Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.,</i> 395 U. S. 225, 232 (1969) (approving a lower court desegregation order that \"provided that the [school] board must move toward a goal under which `in each school the ratio of white to Negro faculty members is substantially the same as it is throughout the system,'\" and \"immediately\" requiring \"[t]he ratio of Negro to white teachers\" in each school to be equal to \"the ratio of Negro to white teachers in . . . the system as a whole\").</p>\n<p>Second, broad-range limits on voluntary school choice plans are less burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored, see <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 341, than other race-conscious restrictions this Court has previously approved. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann, supra,</i> at 26-27; <i>Montgomery Co. </i><i>Bd. of Ed., supra,</i> at 232. Indeed, the plans before us are <i>more narrowly tailored</i> than the race-conscious admission plans that this Court approved in <i>Grutter.</i> Here, race becomes a factor only in a fraction of students' non-merit-based assignmentsnot in large numbers of students' merit-based applications. Moreover, the effect of applying race-conscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged students <i>less severely,</i> not more severely, than the criteria at issue in <i>Grutter.</i> Disappointed students are not rejected from a State's flagship graduate program; they simply attend a different one of the district's many public schools, which in aspiration and in fact are substantially equal. Cf. <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 283. And, in Seattle, the disadvantaged student loses at most one year at the high school of his choice. One will search <i>Grutter</i> in vain for similarly persuasive evidence of narrow tailoring as the school districts have presented here.</p>\n<p>Third, the manner in which the school boards developed these plans itself reflects \"narrow tailoring.\" Each plan was devised to overcome a history of segregated public schools. Each plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation. Each plan is the product of a process that has sought to enhance student choice, while diminishing the need for mandatory busing. And each plan's use of race-conscious elements is <i>diminished</i> compared to the use of race in preceding integration plans.</p>\n<p>The school boards' widespread consultation, their experimentation with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40-year history that Part I sets forth, make clear that plans that are less explicitly race-based are unlikely to achieve the board's \"compelling\" objectives. The history of each school system reveals highly segregated schools, followed by remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by efforts to attract or retain students through the use of plans that abandoned busing and replaced it with greater student choice. Both cities once tried to achieve more integrated schools by relying solely upon measures such as redrawn district boundaries, new school building construction, and unrestricted voluntary transfers. In neither city did these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the city's integration goals. See Parts IA and IB, <i>supra,</i> at 6-18<i>.</i></p>\n<p>Moreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school board's knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these particular matters is not inconsistent with rigorous judicial scrutiny. It simply recognizes that judges are not well suited to act as school administrators. Indeed, in the context of school desegregation, this Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of acknowledging that local school boards better understand their own communities and have a better knowledge of what in practice will best meet the educational needs of their pupils. See <i>Milliken,</i> 418 U. S., at 741-42 (\"No single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for public schools and to quality of the educational process\"). See also <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist. </i> v. <i>Rodriguez,</i> 411 U. S. 1, 49-50 (1973) (extolling local control for \"the opportunity it offers for participation in the decisionmaking process that determines how . . . local tax dollars will be spent. Each locality is free to tailor local programs to local needs. Pluralism also affords some opportunity for experimentation, innovation, and a healthy competition for educational excellence\"); <i>Epperson </i> v. <i>Arkansas,</i> 393 U. S. 97, 104 (1968) (\"Judicial interposition in the operation of the public school system of the Nation raises problems requiring care and restraint. . . . By and large, public education in our Nation is committed to the control of state and local authorities\"); <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 349 U. S. 294, 299 (1955) <i>(Brown II)</i> (\"Full implementation of these constitutional principles may require solution of varied local school problems. School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems; courts will have to consider whether the action of school authorities constitutes good faith implementation of the governing constitutional principles\").</p>\n<p>Experience in Seattle and Louisville is consistent with experience elsewhere. In 1987, the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights studied 125 large school districts seeking integration. It reported that most districts-92 of them, in factadopted desegregation policies that combined two or more highly race-conscious strategies, for example, rezoning or pairing. See Welch 83-91.</p>\n<p>Having looked at dozens of <i>amicus</i> briefs, public reports, news stories, and the records in many of this Court's prior cases, which together span 50 years of desegregation history in school districts across the Nation, I have discovered many examples of districts that sought integration through explicitly race-conscious methods, including mandatory busing. Yet, I have found <i>no</i> example or model that would permit this Court to say to Seattle and to Louisville: \"Here is an instance of a desegregation plan that is likely to achieve your objectives and also makes less use of race-conscious criteria than your plans.\" And, if the plurality cannot suggest such a modeland it cannotthen it seeks to impose a \"narrow tailoring\" requirement that in practice would never be met.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if there is no such plan, or if such plans are purely imagined, it is understandable why, as the plurality notes, <i>ante,</i> at 27, Seattle school officials concentrated on diminishing the racial component of their districts' plan, but did not pursue eliminating that element entirely. For the plurality now to insist as it does, <i>ante,</i> at 27-28, that these school districts ought to have said so officially is either to ask for the superfluous (if they need only make explicit what is implicit) or to demand the impossible (if they must somehow provide more proof that there is no hypothetical <i>other</i> plan that could work as well as theirs). I am not aware of any case in which this Court has read the \"narrow tailoring\" test to impose such a requirement. Cf. <i>People Who Care</i> v. <i>Rockford Bd. of Ed. School Dist. No. 205,</i> 961 F. 2d 1335, 1338 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"Would it be necessary to adjudicate the obvious before adopting (or permitting the parties to agree on) a remedy . . . ?\").</p>\n<p>The plurality also points to the school districts' use of numerical goals based upon the racial breakdown of the general school population, and it faults the districts for failing to prove that <i>no other set of numbers will work.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 18-20. The plurality refers to no case in support of its demand. Nor is it likely to find such a case. After all, this Court has in many cases explicitly permitted districts to use target ratios based upon the district's underlying population. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 24-25; <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S., at 46; <i>Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.,</i> 395 U. S., at 232. The reason is obvious: In Seattle, where the overall student population is 41% white, permitting 85% white enrollment at a single school would make it much more likely that other schools would have very few white students, whereas in Jefferson County, with a 60% white enrollment, one school with 85% white students would be less likely to skew enrollments elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is research-based evidence supporting, for example, that a ratio no greater than 50% minority which is Louisville's starting point, and as close as feasible to Seattle's starting pointis helpful in limiting the risk of \"white flight.\" See Orfield, Metropolitan School Desegregation: Impacts on Metropolitan Society, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy 121, 125. Federal law also assumes that a similar target percentage will help avoid detrimental \"minority group isolation.\" See No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title V, Part C, 115 Stat. 1806, 20 U. S. C. §7231 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 34 CFR §§280.2, 280.4 (2006) (implementing regulations). What other numbers are the boards to use as a \"starting point\"? Are they to spend days, weeks, or months seeking independently to validate the use of ratios that this Court has repeatedly authorized in prior cases? Are they to draw numbers out of thin air? These districts have followed this Court's holdings and advice in \"tailoring\" their plans. That, too, strongly supports the lawfulness of their methods.</p>\n<p>Nor could the school districts have accomplished their desired aims (<i>e.g.,</i> avoiding forced busing, countering white flight, maintaining racial diversity) by other means. Nothing in the extensive history of desegregation efforts over the past 50 years gives the districts, or this Court, any reason to believe that another method is possible to accomplish these goals. Nevertheless, JUSTICE KENNEDY suggests that school boards:</p>\n<blockquote>\"may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 8.</blockquote>\n<p>But, as to \"strategic site selection,\" Seattle has built one new high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized school serves only 300 students). In fact, six of the Seattle high schools involved in this case were built by the 1920's; the other four were open by the early 1960's. See generally N. Thompson &amp; C. Marr, Building for Learning: Seattle Public Schools Histories, 1862-2000 (2002). As to \"drawing\" neighborhood \"attendance zones\" on a racial basis, Louisville tried it, and it worked only when forced busing was also part of the plan. See <i>supra,</i> at 12-14. As to \"allocating resources for special programs,\" Seattle and Louisville have both experimented with this; indeed, these programs are often referred to as \"magnet schools,\" but the limited desegregation effect of these efforts extends at most to those few schools to which additional resources are granted. In addition, there is no evidence from the experience of these school districts that it will make any meaningful impact. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, p. 42. As to \"recruiting faculty\" on the basis of race, both cities have tried, but only as one part of a broader program. As to \"tracking enrollments, performance and other statistics by race,\" tracking <i>reveals</i> the problem; it does not cure it.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY sets forth two additional concerns related to \"narrow tailoring.\" In respect to Louisville, he says first that officials stated (1) that kindergarten assignments are not subject to the race-conscious guidelines, and (2) that the child at issue here was denied permission to attend the kindergarten he wanted because of those guidelines. Both, he explains, cannot be true. He adds that this confusion illustrates that Louisville's assignment plan (or its explanation of it to this Court) is insufficiently precise in respect to \"who makes the decisions,\" \"over-sight,\" \"the precise circumstances in which an assignment decision\" will be made; and \"which of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given race-based decision.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 4.</p>\n<p>The record suggests, however, that the child in question was not assigned to the school he preferred because he missed the kindergarten application deadline. See App. in 05-915, p. 20. After he had enrolled and after the academic year had begun, he then applied to transfer to his preferred school after the kindergarten assignment dead-line had passed, <i>id.,</i> at 21, possibly causing school officials to treat his late request as an application to transfer to the first grade, in respect to which the guidelines apply. I am not certain just how the remainder of JUSTICE KENNEDY's concerns affect the lawfulness of the Louisville program, for they seem to be failures of explanation, not of administration. But Louisville should be able to answer the relevant questions on remand.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY's second concern is directly related to the merits of Seattle's plan: Why does Seattle's plan group Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native-Americans, and African-Americans together, treating all as similar minorities? <i>Ante,</i> at 6-7. The majority suggests that Seattle's classification system could permit a school to be labeled \"diverse\" with a 50% Asian-American and 50% white student body, and no African-American students, Hispanic students, or students of other ethnicity. <i>Ante,</i> at 6; <i>ante,</i> at 15-16 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p>The 50/50 hypothetical has no support in the record here; it is conjured from the imagination. In fact, Seattle apparently began to treat these different minority groups alike in response to the federal Emergency School Aid Act's requirement that it do so. Siqueland 116-117. See also Hanawalt 31; Pub. L. 95-561, Tit. VI (1978) (prescribing percentage enrollment requirements for \"minority\" students); Siqueland 55 (discussing HEW definition of \"minority\"). Moreover, maintaining this federally mandated system of classification makes sense insofar as Seattle's experience indicates that the relevant circumstances in respect to each of these different minority groups are roughly similar, <i>e.g.,</i> in terms of residential patterns, and call for roughly similar responses. This is confirmed by the fact that Seattle has been able to achieve a desirable degree of diversity without the <i>greater</i> emphasis on race that drawing fine lines among minority groups would require. Does the plurality's view of the Equal Protection Clause mean that courts must give no weight to such a board determination? Does it insist upon especially strong evidence supporting inclusion of multiple minority groups in an otherwise lawful government minority-ssistance program? If so, its interpretation threatens to produce divisiveness among minority groups that is incompatible with the basic objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment. Regardless, the plurality cannot object that the constitutional defect is the individualized use of race and simultaneously object that not enough account of individuals' race has been taken.</p>\n<p>Finally, I recognize that the Court seeks to distinguish <i>Grutter</i> from these cases by claiming that <i>Grutter</i> arose in \"`the context of higher education.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 16. But that is not a meaningful legal distinction. I have explained why I do not believe the Constitution could possibly find \"compelling\" the provision of a racially diverse education for a 23-year-old law student but not for a 13-year-old high school pupil. See <i>supra,</i> at 46-48. And I have explained how the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than those in <i>Grutter.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 45. I add that one cannot find a relevant distinction in the fact that these school districts did not examine the merits of applications \"individual[ly].\" See <i>ante,</i> at 13-15. The context here does not involve admission by merit; a child's academic, artistic, and athletic \"merits\" are not at all relevant to the child's placement. These are not affirmative action plans, and hence \"individualized scrutiny\" is simply beside the point.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that these plans' specific features(1) their limited and historically-diminishing use of race, (2) their strong reliance upon other non-race-conscious elements, (3) their history and the manner in which the districts developed and modified their approach, (4) the comparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably evident alternativestogether show that the districts' plans are \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve their \"compelling\" goals. In sum, the districts' race-conscious plans satisfy \"strict scrutiny\" and are therefore lawful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Direct Precedent</i></h2>\n<p>Two additional precedents more directly related to the plans here at issue reinforce my conclusion. The first consists of the District Court determination in the Louisville case when it dissolved its desegregation order that there was \"overwhelming evidence of the Board's good faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes,\" indeed that the Board had \"treated the ideal of an integrated system as much more than a legal obligationthey consider it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded public school education.\" <i>Hampton II,</i> 102 F. Supp. 2d, at 370. When the court made this determination in 2000, it did so in the context of the Louisville desegregation plan that the board had adopted in 1996. That plan, which took effect before 1996, is the very plan that in all relevant respects is in effect now and is the subject of the present challenge.</p>\n<p>No one claims that (the relevant portion of) Louisville's plan was unlawful in 1996 when Louisville adopted it. To the contrary, there is every reason to believe that it represented part of an effort to implement the 1978 desegregation order. But if the plan was lawful when it was first adopted and if it was lawful the day before the District Court dissolved its order, how can the plurality now suggest that it became <i>unlawful</i> the following day? Is it conceivable that the Constitution, implemented through a court desegregation order, could permit (perhaps <i>require</i>) the district to make use of a race-conscious plan the day before the order was dissolved and then <i>forbid</i> the district to use the identical plan the day after? See <i>id.,</i> at 380 (\"The very analysis for dissolving desegregation decrees supports continued maintenance of a desegregated system as a compelling state interest\"). The Equal Protection Clause is not incoherent. And federal courts would rightly hesitate to find unitary status if the consequences of the ruling were so dramatically disruptive.</p>\n<p>Second, <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S. 457, is directly on point. That case involves the original Seattle Plan, a <i>more heavily race-conscious predecessor</i> of the very plan now before us. In <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> this Court struck down a state referendum that effectively barred implementation of Seattle's desegregation plan and \"burden[ed] all future attempts to integrate Washington schools in districts throughout the State.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 462-463, 483. Because the referendum would have prohibited the adoption of a school-integration plan that involved mandatory busing, and because it would have imposed a special burden on school integration plans (plans that sought to integrate previously segregated schools), the Court found it unconstitutional. <i>Id.,</i> at 483-487.</p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, the Court did not directly address the constitutional merits of the underlying Seattle plan. But it explicitly cited <i>Swann</i>'s statement that the Constitution permitted a local district to adopt such a plan. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. It also cited to Justice Powell's opinion in <i>Bakke, approving of</i> the limited use of race-conscious criteria in a university-admissions \"affirmative action\" case. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15<i>.</i> In addition, the Court stated that \"[a]ttending an ethnically diverse school,\" <i>id.,</i> at 473, could help prepare \"minority children for citizenship in our pluralistic society,\" hope-fully \"teaching members of the racial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to believe that the Court that held unconstitutional a referendum that would have interfered with the implementation of this plan thought that the integration plan it sought to preserve was itself an <i>unconstitutional</i> plan. And if <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i> is premised upon the constitutionality of the original Seattle Plan, it is equally premised upon the constitutionality of the present plan, for the present plan <i>is</i> the Seattle Plan, modified only insofar as it places even <i>less</i> emphasis on race-conscious elements than its predecessors.</p>\n<p>It is even more difficult to accept the plurality's contrary view, namely that the underlying plan was unconstitutional. If that is so, then <i>all</i> of Seattle's earlier (even more race-conscious) plans must also have been unconstitutional. That necessary implication of the plurality's position strikes the 13th chime of the clock. How could the plurality adopt a constitutional standard that would hold unconstitutional large numbers of race-conscious integration plans adopted by numerous school boards over the past 50 years while remaining true to this Court's desegregation precedent?</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consequences</i></h2>\n<p>The Founders meant the Constitution as a practical document that would transmit its basic values to future generations through principles that remained workable over time. Hence it is important to consider the potential consequences of the plurality's approach, as measured against the Constitution's objectives. To do so provides further reason to believe that the plurality's approach is legally unsound.</p>\n<p>For one thing, consider the effect of the plurality's views on the parties before us and on similar school districts throughout the Nation. Will Louisville and all similar school districts have to return to systems like Louisville's initial 1956 plan, which did not consider race at all? See <i>supra,</i> at 12. That initial 1956 plan proved ineffective. Sixteen years into the plan, 14 of 19 middle and high schools remained almost totally white or almost totally black. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The districts' past and current plans are not unique. They resemble other plans, promulgated by hundreds of local school boards, which have attempted a variety of desegregation methods that have evolved over time in light of experience. A 1987 Civil Rights Commission Study of 125 school districts in the Nation demonstrated the breadth and variety of desegregation plans:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The [study] documents almost 300 desegregation plans that were implemented between 1961 and 1985. The degree of heterogeneity within these districts is immediately apparent. They are located in every region of the country and range in size from Las Cruces, New Mexico, with barely over 15,000 students attending 23 schools in 1968, to New York City, with more than one million students in 853 schools. The sample includes districts in urban areas of all sizes, suburbs (<i>e.g.,</i> Arlington County, Virginia) and rural areas (<i>e.g.,</i> Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and Raleigh County, West Virginia). It contains 34 countywide districts with central cities (the 11 Florida districts fit this description, plus Clark County, Nevada and others) and a small number of consolidated districts (New Castle County, Delaware and Jefferson County, Kentucky).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The districts also vary in their racial compositions and levels of segregation. Initial plans were implemented in Mobile, Alabama and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and in a number of other southern districts in the face of total racial segregation. At the other extreme, Santa Clara, California had a relatively even racial distribution prior to its 1979 desegregation plan. When the 1965 plan was designed for Harford County, Maryland, the district was 92 percent white. Compton, California, on the other hand, became over 99 percent black in the 1980s, while Buffalo, New York had a virtual 50-50 split between white and minority students prior to its 1977 plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"It is not surprising to find a large number of different desegregation strategies in a sample with this much variation.\" Welch 23 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>A majority of these desegregation techniques explicitly considered a student's race. See <i>id.,</i> at 24-28. Transfer plans, for example, allowed students to shift from a school in which they were in the racial majority to a school in which they would be in a racial minority. Some districts, such as Richmond, California, and Buffalo, New York, permitted only \"one-way\" transfers, in which only black students attending predominantly black schools were permitted to transfer to designated receiver schools. <i>Id.,</i> at 25. Fifty-three of the 125 studied districts used transfers as a component of their plans. <i>Id.,</i> at 83-91.</p>\n<p>At the state level, 46 States and Puerto Rico have adopted policies that encourage or require local school districts to enact interdistrict or intradistrict open choice plans. Eight of those States condition approval of transfers to another school or district on whether the transfer will produce increased racial integration. Eleven other States require local boards to deny transfers that are not in compliance with the local school board's desegregation plans. See Education Commission of the States, Open Enrollment: 50-State Report (2007), online at http://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=268.</p>\n<p>Arkansas, for example, provides by statute that \"[n]o student may transfer to a nonresident district where the percentage of enrollment for the student's race exceeds that percentage in the student's resident district.\" Ark. Code Ann. §6-18-206(f)(1), as amended 2007 Ark. Gen. Acts 552 (2007). An Ohio statute provides, in respect to student choice, that each school district must establish \"[p]rocedures to ensure that an appropriate racial balance is maintained in the district schools.\" Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3313.98(B)(2)(b)(iii) (Lexis Supp. 2006). Ohio adds that a \"district may object to the enrollment of a native student in an adjacent or other district in order to maintain an appropriate racial balance.\" §3313.98 (F)(1)(a).</p>\n<p>A Connecticut statute states that its student choice program will seek to \"preserve racial and ethnic balance.\" Conn. Gen. Stat. §10-266aa(b)(2) (2007). Connecticut law requires each school district to submit racial group population figures to the State Board of Education. §10-226a. Another Connecticut regulation provides that \"[a]ny school in which the Proportion for the School falls outside of a range from 25 percentage points less to 25 percentage points more than the Comparable Proportion for the School District, shall be determined to be racially imbalanced.\" Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-226e-3(b) (1999). A \"racial imbalance\" determination requires the district to submit a plan to correct the racial imbalance, which plan may include \"mandatory pupil reassignment.\" §§10-226e-5(a) and (c)(4).</p>\n<p>Interpreting that State's Constitution, the Connecticut Supreme Court has held legally inadequate the reliance by a local school district solely upon some of the techniques JUSTICE KENNEDY today recommends (<i>e.g.,</i> reallocating resources, etc.). See <i>Sheff</i> v. <i>O'Neill,</i> 238 Conn. 1, 678 A. 2d 1267 (1996). The State Supreme Court wrote: \"Despite the initiatives undertaken by the defendants to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among school districts, and despite the fact that the defendants did not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the disparities that continue to burden the education of the plaintiffs infringe upon their fundamental state constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 42, 678 A. 2d, at 1289.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, the plurality's views would threaten a surge of race-based litigation. Hundreds of state and federal statutes and regulations use racial classifications for educational or other purposes. See <i>supra,</i> at 27. In many such instances, the contentious force of legal challenges to these classifications, meritorious or not, would displace earlier calm.</p>\n<p>The wide variety of different integration plans that school districts use throughout the Nation suggests that the problem of racial segregation in schools, including <i>de facto</i> segregation, is difficult to solve. The fact that many such plans have used explicitly racial criteria suggests that such criteria have an important, sometimes necessary, role to play. The fact that the controlling opinion would make a school district's use of such criteria often unlawful (and the plurality's \"colorblind\" view would make such use always unlawful) suggests that today's opinion will require setting aside the laws of several States and many local communities.</p>\n<p>As I have pointed out, <i>supra,</i> at 4, <i>de facto</i> resegregation is on the rise. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> It is reasonable to conclude that such resegregation can create serious educational, social, and civic problems. See <i>supra,</i> at 37-45. Given the conditions in which school boards work to set policy, see <i>supra,</i> at 20-21, they may need all of the means presently at their disposal to combat those problems. Yet the plurality would deprive them of at least one tool that some districts now consider vitalthe limited use of broad race-conscious student population ranges.</p>\n<p>I use the words \"may need\" here deliberately. The plurality, or at least those who follow JUSTICE THOMAS' \"`color-blind'\" approach, see <i>ante,</i> at 26-27 (THOMAS, J., concurring); <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 353-354 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), may feel confident that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end <i>all</i> governmental use of race-conscious criteria including those with inclusive objectives. See <i>ante,</i> at 40-41 (plurality opinion); see also <i>ante,</i> at 26 (THOMAS, J., concurring). By way of contrast, I do not claim to know how best to stop harmful discrimination; how best to create a society that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious problems of increasing <i>de facto</i> segregation, troubled inner city schooling, and poverty correlated with race. But, as a judge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize judges to dictate solutions to these problems. Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers. And it is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation's children and how best to administer America's schools to achieve that aim. The Court should leave them to their work. And it is for them to decide, to quote the plurality's slogan, whether the best \"way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 40-41. See also <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> 426 F. 3d, at 1222 (Bea, J., dissenting) (\"The way to end racial discrimination is to stop discriminating by race\"). That is why the Equal Protection Clause outlaws invidious discrimination, but does not similarly forbid all use of race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as affording the people, acting through their elected representatives, freedom to select the use of \"race-conscious\" criteria from among their available options. See <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.,</i> 515 U. S., at 237 (\"[S]trict scrutiny\" in this context is \"[not] `strict in theory, but fatal in fact' \" (quoting <i>Fullilove,</i> 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment))). Today, however, the Court restricts (and some Members would eliminate) that leeway. I fear the consequences of doing so for the law, for the schools, for the democratic process, and for America's efforts to create, out of its diversity, one Nation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusions</i></h2>\n<p>To show that the school assignment plans here meet the requirements of the Constitution, I have written at exceptional length. But that length is necessary. I cannot refer to the history of the plans in these cases to justify the use of race-conscious criteria without describing that history in full. I cannot rely upon <i>Swann</i>'s statement that the use of race-conscious limits is permissible without showing, rather than simply asserting, that the statement represents a constitutional principle firmly rooted in federal and state law. Nor can I explain my disagreement with the Court's holding and the plurality's opinion, without offering a detailed account of the arguments they propound and the consequences they risk.</p>\n<p>Thus, the opinion's reasoning is long. But its conclusion is short: The plans before us satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. And it is the plurality's opinion, not this dissent that \"fails to ground the result it would reach in law.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 28.</p>\n<p>Four basic considerations have led me to this view. <i>First,</i> the histories of Louisville and Seattle reveal complex circumstances and a long tradition of conscientious efforts by local school boards to resist racial segregation in public schools. Segregation at the time of <i>Brown</i> gave way to expansive remedies that included busing, which in turn gave rise to fears of white flight and resegregation. For decades now, these school boards have considered and adopted and revised assignment plans that sought to rely less upon race, to emphasize greater student choice, and to improve the conditions of all schools for all students, no matter the color of their skin, no matter where they happen to reside. The plans under reviewwhich are less burdensome, more egalitarian, and more effective than prior planscontinue in that tradition. And their history reveals school district goals whose remedial, educational, and democratic elements are inextricably intertwined each with the others. See Part I, <i>supra,</i> at 2-21.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> since this Court's decision in <i>Brown,</i> the law has consistently and unequivocally approved of both voluntary and compulsory race-conscious measures to combat segregated schools. The Equal Protection Clause, ratified following the Civil War, has always distinguished in practice between state action that excludes and thereby subordinates racial minorities and state action that seeks to bring together people of all races. From <i>Swann</i> to <i>Grutter,</i> this Court's decisions have emphasized this distinction, recognizing that the fate of race relations in this country depends upon unity among our children, \"for unless our children begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.\" <i>Milliken,</i> 418 U. S., at 783 (Marshall, J., dissenting). See also C. Sumner, Equality Before the Law: Unconstitutionality of Separate Colored Schools in Massachusetts, in 2 The Works of Charles Sumner 327, 371 (1849) (\"The law contemplates not only that all be taught, but that all shall be taught together\"). See Part II, <i>supra,</i> at 21-37.</p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> the plans before us, subjected to rigorous judicial review, are supported by compelling state interests and are narrowly tailored to accomplish those goals. Just as diversity in higher education was deemed compelling in <i>Grutter,</i> diversity in public primary and secondary schoolswhere there is even more to gainmust be, <i>a fortiori,</i> a compelling state interest. Even apart from <i>Grutter,</i> five Members of this Court agree that \"avoiding racial isolation\" and \"achiev[ing] a diverse student population\" remain today compelling interests. <i>Ante,</i> at 17-18 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). These interests combine remedial, educational, and democratic objectives. For the reasons discussed above, however, I disagree with JUSTICE</p>\n<p>KENNEDY that Seattle and Louisville have not done enough to demonstrate that their present plans are necessary to continue upon the path set by <i>Brown.</i> These plans are <i>more</i> \"narrowly tailored\" than the race-conscious law school admissions criteria at issue in <i>Grutter.</i> Hence, their lawfulness follows <i>a fortiori</i> from this Court's prior decisions. See Parts III-IV, <i>supra,</i> at 37-57.</p>\n<p><i>Fourth,</i> the plurality's approach risks serious harm to the law and for the Nation. Its view of the law rests either upon a denial of the distinction between exclusionary and inclusive use of race-conscious criteria in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, or upon such a rigid application of its \"test\" that the distinction loses practical significance. Consequently, the Court's decision today slows down and sets back the work of local school boards to bring about racially diverse schools. See Part V, <i>supra,</i> at 57-63.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the consequences of the approach the Court takes today are serious. Yesterday, the plans under review were lawful. Today, they are not. Yesterday, the citizens of this Nation could look for guidance to this Court's unanimous pronouncements concerning desegregation. Today, they cannot. Yesterday, school boards had available to them a full range of means to combat segregated schools. Today, they do not.</p>\n<p>The Court's decision undermines other basic institutional principles as well. What has happened to <i>stare decisis?</i> The history of the plans before us, their educational importance, their highly limited use of raceall these and moremake clear that the compelling interest here is stronger than in <i>Grutter.</i> The plans here are more narrowly tailored than the law school admissions program there at issue. Hence, applying <i>Grutter</i>'s strict test, their lawfulness follows <i>a fortiori.</i> To hold to the contrary is to transform that test from \"strict\" to \"fatal in fact\"the very opposite of what <i>Grutter</i> said. And what has happened to <i>Swann?</i> To <i>McDaniel?</i> To <i>Crawford?</i> To <i>Harris?</i> To <i>School Committee of Boston?</i> To <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1?</i> After decades of vibrant life, they would all, under the plurality's logic, be written out of the law.</p>\n<p>And what of respect for democratic local decisionmaking by States and school boards? For several decades this Court has rested its public school decisions upon <i>Swann</i>'s basic view that the Constitution grants local school districts a significant degree of leeway where the inclusive use of race-conscious criteria is at issue. Now localities will have to cope with the difficult problems they face (including resegregation) deprived of one means they may find necessary.</p>\n<p>And what of law's concern to diminish and peacefully settle conflict among the Nation's people? Instead of accommodating different good-faith visions of our country and our Constitution, today's holding upsets settled expectations, creates legal uncertainty, and threatens to produce considerable further litigation, aggravating racerelated conflict.</p>\n<p>And what of the long history and moral vision that the Fourteenth Amendment itself embodies? The plurality cites in support those who argued in <i>Brown</i> against segregation, and JUSTICE THOMAS likens the approach that I have taken to that of segregation's defenders. See <i>ante,</i> at 39-41 (plurality opinion) (comparing Jim Crow segregation to Seattle and Louisville's integration polices); <i>ante,</i> at 28-32 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But segregation policies did not simply tell schoolchildren \"where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,\" <i>ante,</i> at 40 (plurality opinion); they perpetuated a caste system rooted in the institutions of slavery and 80 years of legalized subordination. The lesson of history, see <i>ante,</i> at 39 (plurality opinion), is not that efforts to continue racial segregation are constitutionally indistinguishable from efforts to achieve racial integration. Indeed, it is a cruel distortion of history to compare Topeka, Kansas, in the 1950's to Louisville and Seattle in the modern dayto equate the plight of Linda Brown (who was ordered to attend a Jim Crow school) to the circumstances of Joshua McDonald (whose request to transfer to a school closer to home was initially declined). This is not to deny that there is a cost in applying \"a state-mandated racial label.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 17 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But that cost does not approach, in degree or in kind, the terrible harms of slavery, the resulting caste system, and 80 years of legal racial segregation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Finally, what of the hope and promise of <i>Brown?</i> For much of this Nation's history, the races remained divided. It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court's finest hour, <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> challenged this history and helped to change it. For <i>Brown</i> held out a promise. It was a promise embodied in three Amendments designed to make citizens of slaves. It was the promise of true racial equalitynot as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a matter of everyday life in the Nation's cities and schools. It was about the nature of a democracy that must work for all Americans. It sought one law, one Nation, one people, not simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of how we actually live.</p>\n<p>Not everyone welcomed this Court's decision in <i>Brown.</i> Three years after that decision was handed down, the Governor of Arkansas ordered state militia to block the doors of a white schoolhouse so that black children could not enter. The President of the United States dispatched the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, and federal troops were needed to enforce a desegregation decree. See <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Aaron,</i> 358 U. S. 1 (1958). Today, almost 50 years later, attitudes toward race in this Nation have changed dramatically. Many parents, white and black alike, want their children to attend schools with children of different races. Indeed, the very school districts that once spurned integration now strive for it. The long history of their efforts reveals the complexities and difficulties they have faced. And in light of those challenges, they have asked us not to take from their hands the instruments they have used to rid their schools of racial segregation, instruments that they believe are needed to overcome the problems of cities divided by race and poverty. The plurality would decline their modest request.</p>\n<p>The plurality is wrong to do so. The last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the promise of <i>Brown.</i> To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of <i>Brown.</i> The plurality's position, I fear, would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.</p>\n<p>I must dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF BREYER, J. </h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Resegregation Trends</h2>\n<p>Percentage of Black Students in 90-100 Percent Nonwhite and Majority Nonwhite Public Schools by Region, 1950-1954 to 2000, Fall Enrollment</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n _________________________________________________________________________________________\n|            | 1950- | 1960-|       |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Region     | 1954  | 1961 | 1968  | 1972   | 1976   | 1980   |  1989  |  1999  |  2000  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                     Percentage in 90-100% Nonwhite Schools                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Northeast  |  -   |   40  |  42.7 |  46.9  |  51.4  |  48.7  |  49.8  |  50.2  |  51.2  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Border     | 100  |   59  |  60.2 |  54.7  |  42.5  |  37.0  |  33.7  |  39.7  |  39.6  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| South      | 100  |  100  |  77.8 |  24.7  |  22.4  |  23.0  |  26.0  |  31.1  |  30.9  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Midwest    |  53  |   56  |  58.0 |  57.4  |  51.1  |  43.6  |  40.1  |  45.0  |  46.3  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| West       |  -   |   27  |  50.8 |  42.7  |  36.3  |  33.7  |  26.7  |  29.9  |  29.5  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| U.

This litigation was commenced in July 2000, and the record in the District Court was closed before assignments for the 2001-2002 school year were made. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, p. 9, n. 9. We rely, as did the lower courts, largely on data from the 2000-2001 school year in evaluating the plan. See 426 F. 3d 1162, 1169-1171 (CA9 2005) (en banc) (<i>Parents Involved VII</i>).</p>\n<p>[2]  The racial breakdown of this nonwhite group is approximately 23.8 percent Asian-American, 23.1 percent African-American, 10.3 percent Latino, and 2.8 percent Native-American. See 377 F. 3d 949, 1005-1006 (CA9 2004) (<i>Parents Involved VI</i>) (Graber, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[3]  For the 2001-2002 school year, the deviation permitted from the desired racial composition was increased from 10 to 15 percent. App. in No. 05-908, p. 38a. The bulk of the data in the record was collected using the 10 percent band, see n. 1, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[4]  \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.</p>\n<p>[5]  \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race . . . be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 78 Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. §2000d.</p>\n<p>[6]  \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\" Wash. Rev. Code §49.60.400(1) (2006).</p>\n<p>[7]  Middle and high school students are designated a single resides school and assigned to that school unless it is at the extremes of the racial guidelines. Students may also apply to a magnet school or program, or, at the high school level, take advantage of an open enrollment plan that allows ninth-grade students to apply for admission to any nonmagnet high school. App. in No. 05-915, pp. 39-41, 82-83.</p>\n<p>[8]  It is not clear why the racial guidelines were even applied to Joshua's transfer applicationthe guidelines supposedly do not apply at the kindergarten level. <i>Id.,</i> at 43. Neither party disputes, however, that Joshua's transfer application was denied under the racial guidelines, and Meredith's objection is not that the guidelines were misapplied but rather that race was used at all.</p>\n<p>[9]  Meredith joined a pending lawsuit filed by several other plaintiffs. See <i>id.,</i> at 7-11. The other plaintiffs all challenged assignments to certain specialized schools, and the District Court found these assignments, which are no longer at issue in this case, unconstitutional. <i>McFarland I,</i> 330 F. Supp. 2d 834, 837, 864 (WD Ky. 2004).</p>\n<p>[10]  The districts point to dicta in a prior opinion in which the Court suggested that, while not constitutionally mandated, it would be constitutionally permissible for a school district to seek racially balanced schools as a matter of \"educational policy.\" See <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S. 1, 16 (1971). The districts also quote with approval an in-chambers opinion in which then-Justice Rehnquist made a suggestion to the same effect. See <i>Bustop, Inc.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.,</i> 439 U. S. 1380, 1383 (1978). The citations do not carry the significance the districts would ascribe to them. <i>Swann,</i> evaluating a school district engaged in court-ordered desegregation, had no occasion to consider whether a district's voluntary adoption of race-based assignments in the absence of a finding of prior <i>de jure</i> segregation was constitutionally permissible, an issue that was again expressly reserved in <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S. 457, 472, n. 15 (1982). <i>Bustop,</i> addressing in the context of an emergency injunction application a busing plan imposed by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, is similarly unavailing. Then-Justice Rehnquist, in denying emergency relief, stressed that \"equitable consideration[s]\" counseled against preliminary relief. 439 U. S., at 1383. The propriety of preliminary relief and resolution of the merits are of course \"significantly different\" issues. <i>University of Texas</i> v. <i>Camenisch,</i> 451 U. S. 390, 393 (1981).</p>\n<p>[11]  The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out. Upon enrolling their child with the district, parents are required to identify their child as a member of a particular racial group. If a parent identifies more than one race on the form, \"[t]he application will not be accepted and, if necessary, the enrollment service person taking the application will indicate one box.\" App. in No. 05-908, at 303a.</p>\n<p>[12]  Jefferson County also argues that it would be incongruous to hold that what was constitutionally required of it one dayrace-based assignments pursuant to the desegregation decreecan be constitutionally prohibited the next. But what was constitutionally required of the district prior to 2000 was the elimination of the vestiges of prior segregationnot racial proportionality in its own right. See <i>Freeman </i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> 503 U. S. 467, 494-496 (1992). Once those vestiges were eliminated, Jefferson County was on the same footing as any other school district, and its use of race must be justified on other grounds.</p>\n<p>[13]  Data for the Seattle schools in the several years since this litigation was commenced further demonstrate the minimal role that the racial tiebreaker in fact played. At Ballard, in 2005-2006-when no class at the school was subject to the racial tiebreakerthe student body was 14.2 percent Asian-American, 9 percent African-American, 11.7 percent Latino, 62.3 percent Caucasian, and 2.8 percent Native-American. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-908, p. 7. In 2000-2001, when the racial tiebreaker was last used, Ballard's total enrollment was 17.5 percent Asian-American, 10.8 percent African-American, 10.7 percent Latino, 56.4 percent Caucasian, and 4.6 percent Native-American. App. in No. 05-908, at 283a. Franklin in 2005-2006 was 48.9 percent Asian-American, 33.5 percent African-American, 6.6 percent Latino, 10.2 percent Caucasian, and 0.8 percent Native-American. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-908, at 7. With the racial tiebreaker in 2000-2001, total enrollment was 36.8 percent Asian-American, 32.2 percent African-American, 5.2 percent Latino, 25.1 percent Caucasian, and 0.7 percent Native-American. App. in No. 05-908, at 284a. Nathan Hale's 2005-2006 enrollment was 17.3 percent Asian-American, 10.7 percent African-American, 8 percent Latino, 61.5 percent Caucasian, and 2.5 percent Native-American. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-908, at 7. In 2000-2001, with the racial tiebreaker, it was 17.9 percent AsianA-merican, 13.3 percent African-American, 7 percent Latino, 58.4 percent Caucasian, and 3.4 percent Native-American. App. in No. 05-908, at 286a.</p>\n<p>[14]  In contrast, Seattle's website formerly described \"emphasizing individualism as opposed to a more collective ideology\" as a form of \"cultural racism,\" and currently states that the district has no intention \"to hold onto unsuccessful concepts such as [a] . . . colorblind mentality.\" Harrell, School Web Site Removed: Examples of Racism Sparked Controversy, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 2, 2006, pp. B1, B5. Compare <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> 163 U. S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law\").</p>\n<p>[15]  JUSTICE BREYER makes much of the fact that in 1978 Seattle \"settled\" an NAACP complaint alleging illegal segregation with the federal Office for Civil Rights (OCR). See <i>post,</i> at 5, 8-9, 18, 23. The memorandum of agreement between Seattle and OCR, of course, contains no admission by Seattle that such segregation ever existed or was ongoing at the time of the agreement, and simply reflects a \"desire to avoid the incovenience [<i>sic</i>] and expense of a formal OCR investigation,\" which OCR was obligated under law to initiate upon the filing of such a complaint. Memorandum of Agreement between Seattle School District No. 1 of King County, Washington, and the Office for Civil Rights, United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 2 (June 9, 11978); see also 45 CFR §80.7(c) (2006).</p>\n<p>[16]  In fact, all the cases JUSTICE BREYER's dissent cites as evidence of the \"prevailing legal assumption,\" see <i>post,</i> at 25-27, were decided before this Court definitively determined that \"all racial classifications. . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 227 (1995). Many proceeded under the now-rejected view that classifications seeking to benefit a disadvantaged racial group should be held to a lesser standard of review. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Springfield School Comm.</i> v. <i>Barksdale,</i> 348 F. 2d 261, 266 (CA1 1965). Even if this purported distinction, which JUSTICE STEVENS would adopt, <i>post,</i> at 2, n. 3 (dissenting opinion), had not been already rejected by this Court, the distinction has no relevance to these cases, in which students of all races are excluded from the schools they wish to attend based solely on the racial classifications. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-908, at 202a (noting that 89 nonwhite students were denied assignment to a particular school by operation of Seattle's racial tiebreaker).\n</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS's reliance on <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Ed.,</i> 352 Mass. 693, 227 N. E. 2d 729 (1967), appeal dism'd, 389 U. S. 572 (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>, post,</i> at 3-5, is inapposite for the same reason that many of the cases cited by JUSTICE BREYER are inapposite; the case involved a Massachusetts law that required school districts to avoid racial imbalance in schools but did not specify how to achieve this goaland certainly did not require express racial classifications as the means to do so. The law was upheld under rational-basis review, with the state court explicitly rejecting the suggestionwhich is now plainly the lawthat \"racial group classifications bear a far heavier burden of justification.\" 352 Mass., at 700, 227 N. E. 2d, at 734 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The passage JUSTICE STEVENS quotes proves our point; all the quoted language says is that the school committee \"shall prepare a plan to eliminate the imbalance.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 695, 227 N. E. 2d, at 731; see <i>post,</i> at 4, n. 5. Nothing in the opinion approves use of racial classifications as the means to address the imbalance. The suggestion that our decision today is somehow inconsistent with our disposition of that appeal is belied by the fact that neither the lower courts, the respondent school districts, nor any of their 51 <i>amici</i> saw fit even to cite the case. We raise this fact not to argue that the dismissal should be afforded any different <i>stare decisis</i> effect, but rather simply to suggest that perhapsfor the reasons noted above the dismissal does not mean what JUSTICE STEVENS believes it does.</p>\n<p>[17]  JUSTICE BREYER also tries to downplay the impact of the racial assignments by stating that in Seattle \"students can decide voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of race-conscious criteria).\" <i>Post,</i> at 46. This presumably refers to the district's decision to cease, for 2001-2002 school year assignments, applying the racial tiebreaker to students seeking to transfer to a different school after ninth grade. See App. in No. 05-908, at 137a-139a. There are obvious disincentives for students to transfer to a different school after a full quarter of their high school experience has passed, and the record sheds no light on how transfers to the oversubscribed high schools are handled.</p>\n<p>[1]  In this Court's paradigmatic segregation cases, there was a local ordinance, state statute, or state constitutional provision requiring racial separation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioners in <i>Bolling</i> v. <i>Sharpe,</i> O. T. 1952, No. 4, pp. 28-30 (cataloging state laws requiring separation of the races); <i>id.,</i> at App. A (listing \"Statutory and Constitutional Provisions in the States Where Segregation in Education is Institutionalized\").</p>\n<p>[2]  The dissent refers repeatedly and reverently to \"`integration.' \" However, outside of the context of remediation for past <i>de jure</i> segregation, \"integration\" is simply racial balancing. See <i>post,</i> at 37. There-fore, the school districts' attempts to further \"integrate\" are properly thought of as little more than attempts to achieve a particular racial balance.</p>\n<p>[3]  The dissent's assertion that these plans are necessary for the school districts to maintain their \"hard-won gains\" reveals its conflation of segregation and racial imbalance. <i>Post,</i> at 38. For the dissent's purposes, the relevant hard-won gains are the present racial compositions in the individual schools in Seattle and Louisville. However, the actual hard-won gain in these cases is the elimination of the vestiges of the system of state-enforced racial separation that once existed in Louisville. To equate the achievement of a certain statistical mix in several schools with the elimination of the system of systematic <i>de jure</i> segregation trivializes the latter accomplishment. Nothing but an interest in classroom aesthetics and a hypersensitivity to elite sensibilities justifies the school districts' racial balancing programs. See Part II-B, <i>infra.</i> But \"the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution\" required the disestablishment of <i>de jure</i> segregation. See <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 240 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Assessed in any objective manner, there is no comparison between the two.</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent makes much of the supposed difficulty of determining whether prior segregation was <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto.</i> See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 19-20. That determination typically will not be nearly as difficult as the dissent makes it seem. In most cases, there either will or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the races. See, <i>e.g.,</i> n. 1, <i>supra.</i> And even if the determination is difficult, it is one the dissent acknowledges must be made to determine what remedies school districts are required to adopt. <i>Post,</i> at 43.</p>\n<p>[5]  This Court's opinion in <i>McDaniel</i> v. <i>Barresi,</i> 402 U. S. 39 (1971), fits comfortably within this framework. There, a Georgia school board voluntarily adopted a desegregation plan. At the time of <i>Brown,</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S. 483 (1954), Georgia's Constitution required that \"[s]eparate schools shall be provided for the white and colored races.\" Ga. Const., Art. VII, §1, ch. 2-6401 (1948). Given that state law had previously required the school board to maintain a dual school system, the county was obligated to take measures to remedy its prior <i>de jure</i> segregation. This Court recognized as much in its opinion, which stated that the school board had an \"affirmative duty to dis-establish the dual school system.\" <i>McDaniel, supra,</i> at 41.</p>\n<p>[6]  As I have explained elsewhere, the remedies this Court authorized lower courts to compel in early desegregation cases like <i>Green</i> and <i>Swann</i> were exceptional. See <i>Missouri</i> v. <i>Jenkins,</i> 515 U. S. 70, 124-125 (1995), (THOMAS, J., concurring). Sustained resistance to <i>Brown</i> prompted the Court to authorize extraordinary race-conscious remedial measures (like compelled racial mixing) to turn the Constitution's dictate to desegregate into reality. 515 U. S., at 125 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Even if these measures were appropriate as remedies in the face of widespread resistance to <i>Brown</i>'s mandate, they are not forever insulated from constitutional scrutiny. Rather, \"such powers should have been temporary and used only to overcome the widespread resistance to the dictates of the Constitution.\" 515 U. S., at 125 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>[7]  Though the dissent cites every manner of complaint, record material, and scholarly article relating to Seattle's race-based student assignment efforts, <i>post,</i> at 73-75, it cites no law or official policy that required separation of the races in Seattle's schools. Nevertheless, the dissent tries to cast doubt on the historical fact that the Seattle schools were never segregated by law by citing allegations that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other organizations made in court filings to the effect that Seattle's schools were once segregated by law. See <i>post,</i> at 7-9, 23. These allegations were never proved and were not even made in this case. Indeed, the record before us suggests the contrary. See App. in No. 05-908, pp. 214a, 225a, 257a. Past allegations in another case provide no basis for resolving these cases.</p>\n<p>[8]  Contrary to the dissent's argument, <i>post,</i> at 44, the Louisville school district's interest in remedying its past <i>de jure</i> segregation did vanish the day the District Court found that Louisville had eliminated the vestiges of its historic <i>de jure</i> segregation. See <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</i> 102 F. Supp. 2d 358, at 360 (WD Ky. 2000). If there were further remediation to be done, the District Court could not logically have reached the conclusion that Louisville \"ha[d] eliminated the vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its pernicious effects.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Because Louisville could use race-based measures only as a remedy for past <i>de jure</i> segregation, it is not \"incoherent,\" <i>post,</i> at 56, to say that race-based decisionmaking was allowed to Louisville one daywhile it was still remedyingand forbidden to it the nextwhen remediation was finished. That seemingly odd turnaround is merely a result of the fact that the remediation of <i>de jure</i> segregation is a jealously guarded exception to the Equal Protection Clause's general rule against government race-based decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>[9]  The dissent's appeal to <i>stare decisis, post,</i> at 65, is particularly ironic in light of its apparent willingness to depart from these precedents, <i>post,</i> at 36-37.</p>\n<p>[10]  The idea that government racial classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny did not originate in <i>Adarand.</i> As early as <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> 388 U. S. 1 (1967), this Court made clear that government action that \"rest[s] solely upon distinctions drawn according to race\" had to be \"subjected to the `most rigid scrutiny.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 11 (quoting <i>Korematsu</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 323 U. S. 214, 216 (1944)); see also <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>Florida,</i> 379 U. S. 184, 196 (1964) (requiring a statute drawing a racial classification to be \"necessary, and not merely rationally related, to accomplishment of a permissible state policy\"); <i>id.,</i> at 197 (Harlan, J., concurring) (\"The necessity test . . . should be equally applicable in a case involving state racial discrimination\").</p>\n<p>[11]  At least one of the academic articles the dissent cites to support this proposition fails to establish a causal connection between the supposed educational gains realized by black students and racial mixing. See Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social Science Evidence, 59 Ohio St. L. J. 733 (1998). In the pages following the ones the dissent cites, the author of that article remarks that \"the main reason white and minority students perform better academically in majority white schools is likely that these schools provide greater opportunities to learn. In other words, it is not desegregation per se that improves achievement, but rather the learning advantages some desegregated schools provide.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 744. Evidence that race is a good proxy for other factors that might be correlated with educational benefits does not support a compelling interest in the use of race to achieve academic results.</p>\n<p>[12]  Of course, if the Seattle school board were truly committed to the notion that diversity leads directly to educational benefits, operating a school with such a high \"nonwhite\" enrollment would be a shocking dereliction of its duty to educate the students enrolled in that school.</p>\n<p>[13]  In fact, the available data from the Seattle school district appear to undercut the dissent's view. A comparison of the test results of the schools in the last year the racial balancing program operated to the results in the 2004-to-2005 school year (in which student assignments were race-neutral) does not indicate the decline in black achievement one would expect to find if black achievement were contingent upon a particular racial mix. See Washington State Report Card, online at http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/summary.aspx?schoolId= 1099&amp;OrgType=4&amp;reportLevel=School; http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/ summary.aspx?schoolId=1104&amp;reportLevel=School&amp;orgLinkId=1104&amp;yrs=; http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/summary.aspx?schoolId=1061&amp;report Level=School&amp;orgLinkId=1061&amp;yrs=; http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/ summary.aspx?schoolId=1043&amp;reportLevel=School&amp;orgLinkId=1043&amp; yrs= (showing that reading scores went up, not down, when Seattle's race-based assignment program ended at Sealth High School, Ingraham High School, and Franklin High Schoolsome of the schools most affected by the plan).</p>\n<p>[14]  The dissent accuses me of \"feel[ing] confident that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end <i>all</i> governmental use of race-conscious criteria\" and chastises me for not deferring to democratically elected majorities. See <i>post,</i> at 62. Regardless of what JUSTICE BREYER's goals might be, this Court does not sit to \"create a society that includes all Americans\" or to solve the problems of \"troubled inner city schooling.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We are not social engineers. The United States Constitution dictates that local governments cannot make decisions on the basis of race. Consequently, regardless of the perceived negative effects of racial imbalance, I will not defer to legislative majorities where the Constitution forbids it.\n</p>\n<p>It should escape no one that behind JUSTICE BREYER's veil of judicial modesty hides an inflated role for the Federal Judiciary. The dissent's approach confers on judges the power to say what sorts of discrimination are benign and which are invidious. Having made that determination (based on no objective measure that I can detect), a judge following the dissent's approach will set the level of scrutiny to achieve the desired result. Only then must the judge defer to a democratic majority. In my view, to defer to one's preferred result is not to defer at all.</p>\n<p>[15]  The notion that a \"democratic\" interest qualifies as a compelling interest (or constitutes a part of a compelling interest) is proposed for the first time in today's dissent and has little basis in the Constitution or our precedent, which has narrowly restricted the interests that qualify as compelling. See <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> 539 U. S. 306, 351-354 (2003) (in part and dissenting in part). The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact the dissent's newly minted understanding of liberty. See <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 198 U. S. 45, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (\"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics\").</p>\n<p>[16]  The dissent does not explain how its recognition of an interest in teaching racial understanding and cooperation here is consistent with the Court's rejection of a similar interest in <i>Wygant.</i> In <i>Wygant,</i> a school district justified its race-based teacher-layoff program in part on the theory that \"minority teachers provided `role models' for minority students and that a racially `diverse' faculty would improve the education of all students.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 352 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1984, No. 84-1340, pp. 27-28; 476 U. S., at 315 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)). The Court rejected the interests asserted to justify the layoff program as insufficiently compelling. <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 275-276 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 295 (White, J., concurring in judgment). If a school district has an interest in teaching racial understanding and cooperation, there is no logical reason why that interest should not extend to the composition of the teaching staff as well as the composition of the student body. The dissent's reliance on this interest is, therefore, inconsistent with <i>Wygant.</i></p>\n<p>[17]  Outside the school context, this Court's cases reflect the fact that racial mixing does not always lead to harmony and understanding. In <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> 543 U. S. 499 (2005), this Court considered a California prison policy that separated inmates racially. <i>Id.,</i> at 525-528 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). That policy was necessary because of \"numerous incidents of racial violence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 502; <i>id.,</i> at 532-534 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As a result of this Court's insistence on strict scrutiny of that policy, but see <i>id.,</i> at 538-547, inmates in the California prisons were killed. See <i>Beard</i> v. <i>Banks,</i> 548 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (THOMAS, J., concuring in judgment) (noting that two were killed and hundreds were injured in race rioting subsequent to this Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i>).</p>\n<p>[18]  After discussing the \"democratic element,\" the dissent repeats its assertion that the social science evidence supporting that interest is \"sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine . . . that this interest is compelling.\" <i>Post,</i> at 40. Again, though, the school boards have no say in deciding whether an interest is compelling. Strict scrutiny of race-based government decisionmaking is more searching than <i>Chevron</i>-style administrative review for reasonableness. See <i>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U. S. 837, 845 (1984).</p>\n<p>[19]  The dissent half-heartedly attacks the historical underpinnings of the color-blind Constitution. <i>Post,</i> at 28-29. I have no quarrel with the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment sought to bring former slaves into American society as full members. <i>Post,</i> at 28 (citing <i>Slaughter-House Cases,</i> 16 Wall. 36, 71-72 (1873)). What the dissent fails to understand, however, is that the color-blind Constitution does not bar the government from taking measures to remedy past state  sponsored discriminationindeed, it requires that such measures be taken in certain circumstances. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Part IB, <i>supra.</i> Race-based government measures during the 1860's and 1870's to remedy <i>state  enforced slavery</i> were therefore not inconsistent with the color-blind Constitution.</p>\n<p>[20]  See also Juris.

For example, where does the dissent's principle stop? Can the government force racial mixing against the will of those being mixed? Can the government force black families to relocate to white neighborhoods in the name if bringing the races together? What about historically black colleges, which have \"established traditions and programs that might disproportionately appeal to one race or another\"? <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fordice,</i> 505 U.

The dissent does not and cannot answer these questions because the contours of the distinction it propounds rest entirely in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n<p>[30]  JUSTICE BREYER's good intentions, which I do not doubt, have the shelf life of JUSTICE BREYER's tenure. Unlike the dissenters, I am unwilling to delegate my constitutional responsibilities to local school boards and allow them to experiment with race-based decisionmaking on the assumption that their intentions will forever remain as good as JUSTICE BREYER's. See The Federalist No. 51, p. 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (\"If men were angels, no government would be necessary\"). Indeed, the racial theories endorsed by the Seattle school board should cause the dissenters to question whether local school boards should be entrusted with the power to make decisions on the basis of race. The Seattle school district's Website formerly contained the following definition of \"cultural racism\": \"Those aspects of society that overtly and covertly attribute value and normality to white people and whiteness, and devalue, stereotype, and label people of color as `other,' different, less than, or render them invisible. Examples of these norms include defining white skin tones as nude or flesh colored, having a future time orientation, emphasizing individualism as opposed to a more collective ideology, defining one form of English as standard . . . .\" See Harrell, School Web Site Removed: Examples of Racism Sparked Controversy, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 2, 2006, p. B1. After the site was removed, the district offered the comforting clarification that the site was not intended \"`to hold onto unsuccessful concepts such as melting pot or colorblind mentality.'\" <i>Ibid.;</i> see also <i>ante,</i> at 22, n. 15 (plurality opinion).\n</p>\n<p>More recently, the school district sent a delegation of high school students to a \"White Privilege Conference.\" See Equity and Race Relations White Privilege Conference, https://www.seattleschools. org/area/equityandrace/whiteprivilegeconference.xml. One conference participant described \"white privilege\" as \"an invisible package of unearned assets which I can count on cashing in each day, but about which I was meant to remain oblivious. White Privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks.\" See White Privilege Conference, Questions and Answers, http://www.uccs.edu/~wpc/ faqs.htm; see generally Westneat, School District's Obsessed with Race, Seattle Times, Apr. 1, 2007, p. B1 (describing racial issues in Seattle schools).</p>\n<p>[1]  Le Lys Rouge (The Red Lily) 95 (W. Stephens transl. 6th ed. 1922).</p>\n<p>[2]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> J. Wilkinson, From <i>Brown</i> to <i>Bakke</i> 11 (1979) (\"Everyone understands that <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> helped deliver the Negro from over three centuries of legal bondage\"); Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L. J. 421, 424-425 (\"History, too, tells us that segregation was imposed on one race by the other race; consent was not invited or required. Segregation in the South grew up and is kept going because and only because the white race has wanted it that wayan incontrovertible fact which itself hardly consorts with equality\").</p>\n<p>[3]  I have long adhered to the view that a decision to exclude a member of a minority because of his race is fundamentally different from a decision to include a member of a minority for that reason. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> 515 U. S. 200, 243, 248, n. 6 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> 476 U. S. 267, 316 (1986) (same). This distinction is critically important in the context of education. While the focus of our opinions is often on the benefits that minority schoolchildren receive from an integrated education, see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 15 (THOMAS, J., concurring), children of <i>all</i> races benefit from integrated classrooms and playgrounds, see <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 316 (\"[T]he fact that persons of different races do, indeed, have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons. The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it\").</p>\n<p>[4]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE twice cites my dissent in <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> 448 U. S. 448 (1980). See <i>ante,</i> at 12, 23. In that case, I stressed the importance of confining a remedy for <i>past</i> wrongdoing to the members of the injured class. See 448 U. S., at 539. The present cases, unlike <i>Fullilove</i> but like our decision in <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S. 267, require us to \"ask whether the Board[s'] actions[s] advanc[e] the public interest in educating children for the <i>future,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 313 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). See <i>ibid.</i> (\"In my opinion, it is not necessary to find that the Board of Education has been guilty of racial discrimination in the past to support the conclusion that it has a legitimate interest in employing more black teachers in the future\"). See also <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 261-262 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"This program, then, if in part a remedy for past discrimination, is most importantly a forward-looking response to practical problems faced by minority subcontractors\").</p>\n<p>[5]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE states that the Massachusetts racial imbalance Act did not require express classifications. See <i>ante,</i> at 31-32, n. 16. This is incorrect. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court expressly stated: \"The racial imbalance act requires the school committee of every municipality annually to submit statistics showing the percentage of nonwhite pupils in all public schools and in each school. Whenever the board finds that racial imbalance exists in a public school, it shall give written notice to the appropriate school committee, which shall prepare a plan to eliminate imbalance and file a copy with the board. `The term \"racial imbalance\" refers to a ratio between nonwhite and other students in public schools which is sharply out of balance with the racial composition of the society in which nonwhite children study, serve and work. For the purpose of this section, racial imbalance shall be deemed to exist when the per cent of nonwhite students in any public school is in excess of fifty per cent of the total number of students in such school.'\" 352 Mass., at 695, 227 N. E. 2d, at 731.</p>\n<p>[6]  Compare <i>ante,</i> at 39 (\"It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954\"), with Juris.

The Seattle school district classifies children as white or non-white; the Jefferson County school district as black or \"other.\" In Seattle, this racial classification is used to allocate slots in oversubscribed high schools. In Jefferson County, it is used to make certain elementary school assignments and to rule on transfer requests. In each case, the school district relies upon an individual student's race in assigning that student to a particular school, so that the racial balance at the school falls within a predetermined range based on the racial composition of the school district as a whole. Parents of students denied assignment to particular schools under these plans solely because of their race brought suit, contending that allocating children to different public schools on the basis of race violated the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection. The Courts of Appeals below upheld the plans. We granted certiorari, and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>Both cases present the same underlying legal question whether a public school that had not operated legally segregated schools or has been found to be unitary may choose to classify students by race and rely upon that classification in making school assignments.

In 1998, it adopted the plan at issue in this case for assigning students to these schools. App. in No. 05-908, pp. 90a-92a.<sup>[1]</sup> The plan allows incoming ninth graders to choose from among any of the district's high schools, ranking however many schools they wish in order of preference.</p>\n<p>Some schools are more popular than others. If too many students list the same school as their first choice, the district employs a series of \"tiebreakers\" to determine who will fill the open slots at the oversubscribed school. The first tiebreaker selects for admission students who have a sibling currently enrolled in the chosen school. The next tiebreaker depends upon the racial composition of the particular school and the race of the individual student. In the district's public schools approximately 41 percent of enrolled students are white; the remaining 59 percent, comprising all other racial groups, are classified by Seattle for assignment purposes as nonwhite. <i>Id.,</i> at 38a, 103a.<sup>[2]</sup> If an oversubscribed school is not within 10 percentage points of the district's overall white/nonwhite racial balance, it is what the district calls \"integration positive,\" and the district employs a tiebreaker that selects for assignment students whose race \"will serve to bring the school into balance.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38a. See <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792253\"><a href=\"/opinion/792253/parents-involved-in-community-schools-a-washington-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1169-1170 (CA9 2005) (en banc).<sup>[3]</sup> If it is still necessary to select students for the school after using the racial tiebreaker, the next tiebreaker is the geographic proximity of the school to the student's residence. App. in No. 05-908, at 38a.</p>\n<p>Seattle has never operated segregated schoolslegally separate schools for students of different racesnor has it ever been subject to court-ordered desegregation. It none-theless employs the racial tiebreaker in an attempt to address the effects of racially identifiable housing patterns on school assignments. Most white students live in the northern part of Seattle, most students of other racial backgrounds in the southern part. <i>Parents Involved VII, supra,</i> at 1166. Four of Seattle's high schools are located in the northBallard, Nathan Hale, Ingraham, and Rooseveltand five in the southRainier Beach, Cleveland, West Seattle, Chief Sealth, and Franklin. One school Garfieldis more or less in the center of Seattle. App. in No. 05-908, at 38a-39a, 45a.</p>\n<p>For the 2000-2001 school year, five of these schools were oversubscribedBallard, Nathan Hale, Roosevelt, Garfield, and Franklinso much so that 82 percent of incoming ninth graders ranked one of these schools as their first choice. <i>Id.,</i> at 38a. Three of the oversubscribed schools were \"integration positive\" because the school's white enrollment the previous school year was greater than 51 percentBallard, Nathan Hale, and Roosevelt. Thus, more nonwhite students (107, 27, and 82, respectively) who selected one of these three schools as a top choice received placement at the school than would have been the case had race not been considered, and proximity been the next tiebreaker. <i>Id.,</i> at 39a40a. Franklin was \"integration positive\" because its nonwhite enrollment the previous school year was greater than 69 percent; 89 more white students were assigned to Franklin by operation of the racial tiebreaker in the 2000-2001 school year than otherwise would have been. <i>Ibid.</i> Garfield was the only oversubscribed school whose composition during the 1999-2000 school year was within the racial guidelines, although in previous years Garfield's enrollment had been predominantly nonwhite, and the racial tiebreaker had been used to give preference to white students. <i>Id.,</i> at 39a.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools (Parents Involved) is a nonprofit corporation comprising the parents of children who have been or may be denied assignment to their chosen high school in the district because of their race. The concerns of Parents Involved are illustrated by Jill Kurfirst, who sought to enroll her ninth-grade son, Andy Meeks, in Ballard High School's special Biotechnology Career Academy. Andy suffered from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, but had made good progress with hands-on instruction, and his mother and middle school teachers thought that the smaller biotechnology program held the most promise for his continued success. Andy was accepted into this selective program but, because of the racial tiebreaker, was denied assignment to Ballard High School. <i>Id.,</i> at 143a-146a, 152a-160a. Parents Involved commenced this suit in the Western District of Washington, alleging that Seattle's use of race in assignments violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,<sup>[4]</sup> Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,<sup>[5]</sup> and the Washington Civil Rights Act.<sup>[6]</sup><i>Id.,</i> at 28a-35a.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted summary judgment to the school district, finding that state law did not bar the district's use of the racial tiebreaker and that the plan survived strict scrutiny on the federal constitutional claim because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2472446\"><a href=\"/opinion/2472446/parents-involved-in-community-schools-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district assigns students to nonmagnet schools in one of two ways: Parents of kindergartners, first-graders, and students new to the district may submit an application indicating a first and second choice among the schools within their cluster; students who do not submit such an application are assigned within the cluster by the district. \"Decisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the schools and the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 38.

Jefferson County assigned Joshua to another elementary school in his cluster, Young Elementary.

See Tr. in <i>McFarland I,</i> pp. 1-49 through 1-54 (Dec. 8, 2003). Space was available at Bloom, and intercluster transfers are allowed, but Joshua's transfer was nonetheless denied because, in the words of Jefferson County, \"[t]he transfer would have an adverse effect on desegregation compliance\" of Young.

We granted certiorari. 547 U. S. __ (2006).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must assure ourselves of our jurisdiction. Seattle argues that Parents Involved lacks standing because none of its current members can claim an imminent injury. Even if the district maintains the current plan and reinstitutes the racial tiebreaker, Seattle argues, Parents Involved members will only be affected if their children seek to enroll in a Seattle public high school and choose an oversubscribed school that is integration positivetoo speculative a harm to maintain standing. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, pp. 16-17.</p>\n<p>This argument is unavailing. The group's members have children in the district's elementary, middle, and high schools, App. in No. 05-908, at 299a-301a; Affidavit of Kathleen Brose Pursuant to this Court's Rule 32.3 (Lodging of Petitioner Parents Involved), and the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of Parents Involved members whose elementary and middle school children may be \"denied admission to the high schools of their choice when they apply for those schools in the future,\" App. in No. 05-908, at 30a. The fact that it is possible that children of group members will not be denied admission to a school based on their race-because they choose an undersubscribed school or an oversubscribed school in which their race is an advantagedoes not eliminate the injury claimed. Moreover, Parents Involved also asserted an interest in not being \"forced to compete for seats at certain high schools in a system that uses race as a deciding factor in many of its admissions decisions.\" <i>Ibid.</i> As we have held, one form of injury under the Equal Protection Clause is being forced to compete in a race-based system that may prejudice the plaintiff, <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 211 (1995); <i>Northeastern Fla.

Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, at 16-17. But the district vigorously defends the constitutionality of its race-based program, and nowhere suggests that if this litigation is resolved in its favor it will not resume using race to assign students. Voluntary cessation does not moot a case or controversy unless \"subsequent events ma[ke] it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,\" <i>Friends of Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 189 (2000) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Concentrated Phosphate Export Assn., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107803\"><a href=\"/opinion/107803/united-states-v-concentrated-phosphate-export-assn-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span>, 203 (1968) (internal quotation marks omitted)), a heavy burden that Seattle has clearly not met.</p>\n<p>Jefferson County does not challenge our jurisdiction, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, p. 48, but we are nonetheless obliged to ensure that it exists, <i>Arbaugh</i> v. <i>Y &amp; H Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145677\"><a href=\"/opinion/145677/arbaugh-v-y-h-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span>, 514 (2006). Although apparently Joshua has now been granted a transfer to Bloom, the school to which transfer was denied under the racial guidelines, Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 45, the racial guidelines apply at all grade levels. Upon Joshua's enrollment in middle school, he may again be subject to assignment based on his race.

In order to satisfy this searching standard of review, the school districts must demonstrate that the use of individual racial classifications in the assignment plans here under review is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve a \"compelling\" government interest. <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 227.</p>\n<p>Without attempting in these cases to set forth all the interests a school district might assert, it suffices to note that our prior cases, in evaluating the use of racial classifications in the school context, have recognized two interests that qualify as compelling. The first is the compelling interest of remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination. See <i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 494 (1992). Yet the Seattle public schools have not shown that they were ever segregated by law, and were not subject to court-ordered desegregation decrees. The Jefferson County public schools were previously segregated by law and were subject to a desegregation decree entered in 1975. In 2000, the District Court that entered that decree dissolved it, finding that Jefferson County had \"eliminated the vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its pernicious effects,\" and thus had achieved \"unitary\" status. <i>Hampton,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 360. Jefferson County accordingly does not rely upon an interest in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination in defending its present use of race in assigning students. See Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 38.</p>\n<p>Nor could it. We have emphasized that the harm being remedied by mandatory desegregation plans is the harm that is traceable to segregation, and that \"the Constitution is not violated by racial imbalance in the schools, without more.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109723\"><a href=\"/opinion/109723/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 280, n. 14 (1977).

Once Jefferson County achieved unitary status, it had remedied the constitutional wrong that allowed racebased assignments. Any continued use of race must be justified on some other basis.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p>The second government interest we have recognized as compelling for purposes of strict scrutiny is the interest in diversity in higher education upheld in <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 328. The specific interest found compelling in <i>Grutter</i> was student body diversity \"in the context of higher education.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The diversity interest was not focused on race alone but encompassed \"all factors that may contribute to student body diversity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 337. We described the various types of diversity that the law school sought:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[The law school's] policy makes clear there are many possible bases for diversity admissions, and provides examples of admittees who have lived or traveled widely abroad, are fluent in several languages, have overcome personal adversity and family hardship, have exceptional records of extensive community service, and have had successful careers in other fields.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 338 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>The Court quoted the articulation of diversity from Justice Powell's opinion in <i>Regents of the University of California </i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1978), noting that \"it is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups, that can justify the use of race.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 324-325 (citing and quoting <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 314-315 (opinion of Powell, J.); brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, what was upheld in <i>Grutter</i> was consideration of \"a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.\" 539 U. S., at 325 (quoting <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 315 (opinion of Powell, J.); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>The entire gist of the analysis in <i>Grutter</i> was that the admissions program at issue there focused on each applicant as an individual, and not simply as a member of a particular racial group. The classification of applicants by race upheld in <i>Grutter</i> was only as part of a \"highly individualized, holistic review,\" 539 U. S., at 337. As the Court explained, \"[t]he importance of this individualized consideration in the context of a race-conscious admissions program is paramount.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The point of the narrow tailoring analysis in which the <i>Grutter</i> Court engaged was to ensure that the use of racial classifications was indeed part of a broader assessment of diversity, and not simply an effort to achieve racial balance, which the Court explained would be \"patently unconstitutional.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 330.</p>\n<p>In the present cases, by contrast, race is not considered as part of a broader effort to achieve \"exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints,\" <i>ibid.</i>; race, for some students, is determinative standing alone. The districts argue that other factors, such as student preferences, affect assignment decisions under their plans, but under each plan when race comes into play, it is decisive by itself. It is not simply one factor weighed with others in reaching a decision, as in <i>Grutter</i>; it is <i>the</i> factor. Like the University of Michigan undergraduate plan struck down in <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U. S., at 275, the plans here \"do not provide for a meaningful individualized review of applicants\" but instead rely on racial classifications in a \"nonindividualized, mechanical\" way. <i>Id.,</i> at 276, 280 (O'Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Even when it comes to race, the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity, viewing race exclusively in white/nonwhite terms in Seattle and black/\"other\" terms in Jefferson County.<sup>[11]</sup> But see <i>Metro Broadcasting, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112484\"><a href=\"/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 610 (1990) (\"We are a Nation not of black and white alone, but one teeming with divergent communities knitted together with various traditions and carried forth, above all, by individuals\") (O'Connor, J., dissenting).

But under the Seattle plan, a school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not. It is hard to understand how a plan that could allow these results can be viewed as being concerned with achieving enrollment that is \"`broadly diverse,'\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 329.</p>\n<p>Prior to <i>Grutter,</i> the courts of appeals rejected as unconstitutional attempts to implement race-based assignment plans-such as the plans at issue herein primary and secondary schools.

After <i>Grutter,</i> however, the two Courts of Appeals in these cases, and one other, found that race-based assignments were permissible at the elementary and secondary level, largely in reliance on that case. See <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1166; <i>McFarland II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 514; <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 13 (CA1 2005).</p>\n<p>In upholding the admissions plan in <i>Grutter,</i> though, this Court relied upon considerations unique to institutions of higher education, noting that in light of \"the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment, universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition.\" 539 U. S., at 329. See also <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 312, 313 (opinion of Powell, J.). The Court explained that \"[c]ontext matters\" in applying strict scrutiny, and repeatedly noted that it was addressing the use of race \"in the context of higher education.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 327, 328, 334. The Court in <i>Grutter</i> expressly articulated key limitations on its holding defining a specific type of broad-based diversity and noting the unique context of higher educationbut these limitations were largely disregarded by the lower courts in extending <i>Grutter</i> to uphold race-based assignments in elementary and secondary schools. The present cases are not governed by <i>Grutter.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Perhaps recognizing that reliance on <i>Grutter</i> cannot sustain their plans, both school districts assert additional interests, distinct from the interest upheld in <i>Grutter,</i> to justify their race-based assignments. In briefing and argument before this Court, Seattle contends that its use of race helps to reduce racial concentration in schools and to ensure that racially concentrated housing patterns do not prevent nonwhite students from having access to the most desirable schools. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, at 19. Jefferson County has articulated a similar goal, phrasing its interest in terms of educating its students \"in a racially integrated environment.\" App. in No. 05-915, at 22.<sup>[12]</sup> Each school district argues that educational and broader socialization benefits flow from a racially diverse learning environment, and each contends that because the diversity they seek is racial diversity not the broader diversity at issue in <i>Grutter</i>it makes sense to promote that interest directly by relying on race alone.</p>\n<p>The parties and their <i>amici</i> dispute whether racial diversity in schools in fact has a marked impact on test scores and other objective yardsticks or achieves intangible socialization benefits. The debate is not one we need to resolve, however, because it is clear that the racial classifications employed by the districts are not narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits asserted to flow from racial diversity. In design and operation, the plans are directed only to racial balance, pure and simple, an objective this Court has repeatedly condemned as illegitimate.</p>\n<p>The plans are tied to each district's specific racial demographics, rather than to any pedagogic concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits. In Seattle, the district seeks white enrollment of between 31 and 51 percent (within 10 percent of \"the district white average\" of 41 percent), and nonwhite enrollment of between 49 and 69 percent (within 10 percent of \"the district minority average\" of 59 percent). App. in No. 05-908, at 103a. In Jefferson County, by contrast, the district seeks black enrollment of no less than 15 or more than 50 percent, a range designed to be \"equally above and below Black student enrollment systemwide,\" <i>McFarland I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 842, based on the objective of achieving at \"all schools . . . an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment\" of 34 percent. App. in No. 05-915, at 81. In Seattle, then, the benefits of racial diversity require enrollment of at least 31 percent white students; in Jefferson County, at least 50 percent. There must be at least 15 percent nonwhite students under Jefferson County's plan; in Seattle, more than three times that figure. This comparison makes clear that the racial demographics in each districtwhatever they happen to be drive the required \"diversity\" numbers. The plans here are not tailored to achieving a degree of diversity necessary  to realize the asserted educational benefits; instead the plans are tailored, in the words of Seattle's Manager of Enrollment Planning, Technical Support, and Demographics, to \"the goal established by the school board of attaining a level of diversity within the schools that approximates the district's overall demographics.\" App. in No. 05-908, at 42a.</p>\n<p>The districts offer no evidence that the level of racial diversity necessary to achieve the asserted educational benefits happens to coincide with the racial demographics of the respective school districtsor rather the white/nonwhite or black/\"other\" balance of the districts, since that is the only diversity addressed by the plans. Indeed, in its brief Seattle simply assumes that the educational benefits track the racial breakdown of the district. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05908, at 36 (\"For Seattle, `racial balance' is clearly not an end in itself but rather a measure of the extent to which the educational goals the plan was designed to foster are likely to be achieved\"). When asked for \"a range of percentage that would be diverse,\" however, Seattle's expert said it was important to have \"sufficient numbers so as to avoid students feeling any kind of specter of exceptionality.\" App. in No. 05-908, at 276a. The district did not attempt to defend the proposition that anything outside its range posed the \"specter of exceptionality.\" Nor did it demonstrate in any way how the educational and social benefits of racial diversity or avoidance of racial isolation are more likely to be achieved at a school that is 50 percent white and 50 percent AsianA-merican, which would qualify as diverse under Seattle's plan, than at a school that is 30 percent Asian-American, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white, which under Seattle's definition would be racially concentrated.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Jefferson County's expert referred to the importance of having \"at least 20 percent\" minority group representation for the group \"to be visible enough to make a difference,\" and noted that \"small isolated minority groups in a school are not likely to have a strong effect on the overall school.\" App. in No. 05-915, at 159, 147. The Jefferson County plan, however, is based on a goal of replicating at each school \"an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide AfricanA-merican enrollment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 81. Joshua McDonald's requested transfer was denied because his race was listed as \"other\" rather than black, and allowing the transfer would have had an adverse effect on the racial guideline compliance of Young Elementary, the school he sought to leave. <i>Id.,</i> at 21. At the time, however, Young Elementary was 46.8 percent black. <i>Id.,</i> at 73. The transfer might have had an adverse effect on the effort to approach district-wide racial proportionality at Young, but it had nothing to do with preventing either the black or \"other\" group from becoming \"small\" or \"isolated\" at Young.</p>\n<p>In fact, in each case the extreme measure of relying on race in assignments is unnecessary to achieve the stated goals, even as defined by the districts. For example, at Franklin High School in Seattle, the racial tiebreaker was applied because nonwhite enrollment exceeded 69 percent, and resulted in an incoming ninth-grade class in 2000-2001 that was 30.3 percent Asian-American, 21.9 percent African-American, 6.8 percent Latino, 0.5 percent NativeA-merican, and 40.5 percent Caucasian. Without the racial tiebreaker, the class would have been 39.6 percent AsianA-merican, 30.2 percent African-American, 8.3 percent Latino, 1.1 percent Native-American, and 20.8 percent Caucasian. See App. in No. 05-908, at 308a. When the actual racial breakdown is considered, enrolling students without regard to their race yields a substantially diverse student body under any definition of diversity.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>In <i>Grutter,</i> the number of minority students the school sought to admit was an undefined \"meaningful number\" necessary to achieve a genuinely diverse student body. 539 U. S., at 316, 335-336. Although the matter was the subject of disagreement on the Court, see <i>id.,</i> at 346-347 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <i>id.,</i> at 382-383 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 388-392 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting), the majority concluded that the law school did not count back from its applicant pool to arrive at the \"meaningful number\" it regarded as necessary to diversify its student body. <i>Id.,</i> at 335-336. Here the racial balance the districts seek is a defined range set solely by reference to the demographics of the respective school districts.</p>\n<p>This working backward to achieve a particular type of racial balance, rather than working forward from some demonstration of the level of diversity that provides the purported benefits, is a fatal flaw under our existing precedent. We have many times over reaffirmed that \"[r]acial balance is not to be achieved for its own sake.\" <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 494. See also <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A.

As the districts' demographics shift, so too will their definition of racial diversity. See App. in No. 05-908, at 103a (describing application of racial tiebreaker based on \"<i>current</i> white percentage\" of 41 percent and \"<i>current</i> minority percentage\" of 59 percent (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>The Ninth Circuit below stated that it \"share[d] in the hope\" expressed in <i>Grutter</i> that in 25 years racial preferences would no longer be necessary to further the interest identified in that case. <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1192. But in Seattle the plans are defended as necessary to address the consequences of racially identifiable housing patterns. The sweep of the mandate claimed by the district is contrary to our rulings that remedying past societal discrimination does not justify race-conscious government action. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Hunt,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span>, 909-910 (1996) (\"[A]n effort to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination is not a compelling interest\"); <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 498-499; <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion) (\"Societal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy\"); <i>id.,</i> at 288 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"[A] governmental agency's interest in remedying `societal' discrimination, that is, discrimination not traceable to its own actions, cannot be deemed sufficiently compelling to pass constitutional muster\").</p>\n<p>The principle that racial balancing is not permitted is one of substance, not semantics. Racial balancing is not transformed from \"patently unconstitutional\" to a compelling state interest simply by relabeling it \"racial diversity.\" While the school districts use various verbal formulations to describe the interest they seek to promoteracial diversity, avoidance of racial isolation, racial integration they offer no definition of the interest that suggests it differs from racial balance. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-908, at 257a (\"Q. What's your understanding of when a school suffers from racial isolation? A. I don't have a definition for that\"); <i>id.,</i> at 228a-229a (\"I don't think we've ever sat down and said, `Define racially concentrated school exactly on point in quantitative terms.' I don't think we've ever had that conversation\"); Tr. in <i>McFarland I,</i> at 1-90 (Dec. 8, 2003) (\"Q. How does the Jefferson County School Board define diversity . . . ?\" \"A. Well, we want to have the schools that make up the percentage of students of the population\").</p>\n<p>Jefferson County phrases its interest as \"racial integration,\" but integration certainly does not require the sort of racial proportionality reflected in its plan. Even in the context of mandatory desegregation, we have stressed that racial proportionality is not required, see <i>Milliken,</i> 433 U. S., at 280, n. 14 (\"[A desegregation] order contemplating the substantive constitutional right [to a] particular degree of racial balance or mixing is . . . infirm as a matter of law\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 24 (1971) (\"The constitutional command to desegregate schools does not mean that every school in every community must always reflect the racial composition of the school system as a whole\"), and here Jefferson County has already been found to have eliminated the vestiges of its prior segregated school system.</p>\n<p>The en banc Ninth Circuit declared that \"when a racially diverse school system is the goal (or racial concentration or isolation is the problem), there is no more effective means than a consideration of race to achieve the solution.\" <i>Parents Involved VII, supra,</i> at 1191. For the foregoing reasons, this conclusory argument cannot sustain the plans. However closely related race-based assignments may be to achieving racial balance, that itself cannot be the goal, whether labeled \"racial diversity\" or anything else. To the extent the objective is sufficient diversity so that students see fellow students as individuals rather than solely as members of a racial group, using means that treat students solely as members of a racial group is fundamentally at cross-purposes with that end.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The districts assert, as they must, that the way in which they have employed individual racial classifications is necessary to achieve their stated ends. The minimal effect these classifications have on student assignments, however, suggests that other means would be effective. Seattle's racial tiebreaker results, in the end, only in shifting a small number of students between schools. Approximately 307 student assignments were affected by the racial tie-breaker in 2000-2001; the district was able to track the enrollment status of 293 of these students. App. in No. 05-908, at 162a. Of these, 209 were assigned to a school that was one of their choices, 87 of whom were assigned to the same school to which they would have been assigned without the racial tiebreaker. Eighty-four students were assigned to schools that they did not list as a choice, but 29 of those students would have been assigned to their respective school without the racial tiebreaker, and 3 were able to attend one of the oversubscribed schools due to waitlist and capacity adjustments. <i>Id.,</i> at 162a-163a. In over one-third of the assignments affected by the racial tiebreaker, then, the use of race in the end made no difference, and the district could identify only 52 students who were ultimately affected adversely by the racial tiebreaker in that it resulted in assignment to a school they had not listed as a preference and to which they would not otherwise have been assigned.</p>\n<p>As the panel majority in <i>Parents Involved VI</i> concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\"[T]he tiebreaker's annual effect is thus merely to shuffle a few handfuls of different minority students between a few schoolsabout a dozen additional Latinos into Ballard, a dozen black students into Nathan Hale, perhaps two dozen Asians into Roosevelt, and so on. The District has not met its burden of proving these marginal changes . . . outweigh the cost of subjecting hundreds of students to disparate treatment based solely upon the color of their skin.\" <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 984985 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Jefferson County's use of racial classifications has only a minimal effect on the assignment of students. Elementary school students are assigned to their first- or second-choice school 95 percent of the time, and transfers, which account for roughly 5 percent of assignments, are only denied 35 percent of the timeand presumably an even smaller percentage are denied on the basis of the racial guidelines, given that other factors may lead to a denial. <i>McFarland I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 844-845, nn. 16, 18. Jefferson County estimates that the racial guidelines account for only 3 percent of assignments. Brief in Opposition in No. 05-915, p. 7, n. 4; Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, at 46. As Jefferson County explains, \"the racial guidelines have minimal impact in this process, because they `mostly influence student assignment in subtle and indirect ways.'\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, pp. 8-9.</p>\n<p>While we do not suggest that <i>greater</i> use of race would be preferable, the minimal impact of the districts' racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications. In <i>Grutter,</i> the consideration of race was viewed as indispensable in more than tripling minority representation at the law schoolfrom 4 to 14.5 percent. See 539 U. S., at 320. Here the most Jefferson County itself claims is that \"because the guidelines provide a firm definition of the Board's goal of racially integrated schools, they `provide administrators with the authority to facilitate, negotiate and collaborate with principals and staff to maintain schools within the 15-50% range.'\" Brief in Opposition in No. 05-915, at 7 (quoting <i>McFarland I, supra,</i> at 842). Classifying and assigning schoolchildren according to a binary conception of race is an extreme approach in light of our precedents and our Nation's history of using race in public schools, and requires more than such an amorphous end to justify it.</p>\n<p>The districts have also failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals. Narrow tailoring requires \"serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives,\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 339, and yet in Seattle several alternative assignment plansmany of which would not have used express racial classificationswere rejected with little or no consideration. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-908, at 224a-225a, 253a-259a, 307a. Jefferson County has failed to present any evidence that it considered alternatives, even though the district already claims that its goals are achieved primarily through means other than the racial classifications. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 8-9. Compare <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (racial classifications permitted only \"as a last resort\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent takes a different approach to these cases, one that fails to ground the result it would reach in law. Instead, it selectively relies on inapplicable precedent and even dicta while dismissing contrary holdings, alters and misapplies our well-established legal framework for assessing equal protection challenges to express racial classifications, and greatly exaggerates the consequences of today's decision. To begin with, JUSTICE BREYER seeks to justify the plans at issue under our precedents recognizing the compelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimination. See <i>post,</i> at 18-24. Not even the school districts go this far, and for good reason. The distinction between segregation by state action and racial imbalance caused by other factors has been central to our jurisprudence in this area for generations. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Milliken,</i> 433 U. S., at 280, n. 14; <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 495-496 (\"Where resegregation is a product not of state action but of private choices, it does not have constitutional implications\"). The dissent elides this distinction between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation, casually intimates that Seattle's school attendance patterns reflect illegal segregation, <i>post,</i> at 5, 18, 23,<sup>[15]</sup> and fails to credit the judicial determinationunder the most rigorous standardthat Jefferson County had eliminated the vestiges of prior segregation. The dissent thus alters in fundamental ways not only the facts presented here but the established law.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's reliance on <i>McDaniel</i> v. <i>Barresi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108318\"><a href=\"/opinion/108318/mcdaniel-v-barresi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span> (1971), <i>post,</i> at 23-24, 29-30, highlights how far removed the discussion in the dissent is from the question actually presented in these cases. <i>McDaniel</i> concerned a Georgia school system that had been segregated by law. There was no doubt that the county had operated a \"dual school system,\" <i>McDaniel, supra,</i> at 41, and no one questions that the obligation to disestablish a school system segregated by law can include race-conscious remedies whether or not a court had issued an order to that effect. See <i>supra,</i> at 12. The present cases are before us, how-ever, because the Seattle school district was never segregated by law, and the Jefferson County district has been found to be unitary, having eliminated the vestiges of its prior dual status. The justification for race-conscious remedies in <i>McDaniel</i> is therefore not applicable here. The dissent's persistent refusal to accept this distinction its insistence on viewing the racial classifications here as if they were just like the ones in <i>McDaniel,</i> \"devised to overcome a history of segregated public schools,\" <i>post,</i> at 47explains its inability to understand why the remedial justification for racial classifications cannot decide these cases.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent next relies heavily on dicta from <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S., at 16-far more heavily than the school districts themselves. Compare <i>post,</i> at 3, 22-28, with Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, at 19-20; Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 31. The dissent acknowledges that the two-sentence discussion in <i>Swann</i> was pure dicta, <i>post,</i> at 22, but nonetheless asserts that it demonstrates a \"basic principle of constitutional law\" that provides \"authoritative legal guidance.\" <i>Post,</i> at 22, 30. Initially, as the Court explained just last Term, \"we are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at issue was not fully debated.\" <i>Central Va. Community College</i> v. <i>Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145688\"><a href=\"/opinion/145688/central-va-community-college-v-katz/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 363 (2006). That is particularly true given that, when <i>Swann</i> was decided, this Court had not yet confirmed that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications like those before us. See n. 16, <i>infra.</i> There is nothing \"technical\" or \"theoretical,\" <i>post,</i> at 30, about our approach to such dicta. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"85330\"><a href=\"/opinion/85330/cohens-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wheat.</span> <span class=\"page\">264</span></a></span>, 399-400 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (explaining why dicta is not binding).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER would not only put such extraordinary weight on admitted dicta, but relies on the statement for something it does not remotely say. <i>Swann</i> addresses only a possible state objective; it says nothing of the permissible <i>means</i>race conscious or otherwisethat a school district might employ to achieve that objective. The reason for this omission is clear enough, since the case did not involve any voluntary means adopted by a school district. The dissent's characterization of <i>Swann</i> as recognizing that \"the Equal Protection Clause permits local school boards to use race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related goals\" isat besta dubious inference. <i>Post,</i> at 22. Even if the dicta from <i>Swann</i> were entitled to the weight the dissent would give it, and no dicta is, it not only did not address the question presented in <i>Swann,</i> it also does not address the question presented in these caseswhether the school districts' use of racial classifications to achieve their stated goals is permissible.</p>\n<p>Further, for all the lower court cases JUSTICE BREYER cites as evidence of the \"prevailing legal assumption\" embodied by <i>Swann,</i> very few are pertinent. Most are not. For example, the dissent features <i>Tometz</i> v. <i>Board of Ed., Waukegan City School Dist. No. 61,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092507/tometz-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, 596-598, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092507/tometz-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span>, 500-502 (1968), an Illinois decision, as evidence that \"state and federal courts had considered the matter settled and uncontroversial.\" <i>Post,</i> at 25. But <i>Tometz</i> addressed a challenge to a statute requiring race-consciousness in drawing school attendance boundaries-an issue well beyond the scope of the question presented in these cases. Importantly, it considered that issue only under rational-basis review, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 600, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 502 (\"The test of any legislative classification essentially is one of reasonableness\"), which even the dissent grudgingly recognizes is an improper standard for evaluating express racial classifications. Other cases cited are similarly inapplicable. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Citizens for Better Ed.</i> v. <i>Goose Creek Consol. Independent School Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409579\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409579/citizens-for-better-educ-v-goose-creek/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">350</span></a></span>, 352-353 (Tex. App. 1986) (upholding rezoning plan under rational-basis review).<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent next looks for authority to a footnote in <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 472, n. 15 (1982), <i>post,</i> at 56-57, but there this Court expressly noted that it was <i>not</i> passing on the propriety of race-conscious student assignments in the absence of a finding of <i>de jure</i> segregation. Similarly, the citation of <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Board of Ed. of Los Angeles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110786\"><a href=\"/opinion/110786/crawford-v-board-of-ed-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span> (1982), <i>post,</i> at 24, in which a state referendum prohibiting a race-based assignment plan was challenged, is inappositein <i>Crawford</i> the Court again expressly reserved the question presented by these cases. 458 U. S.<i>,</i> at 535, n. 11. Such reservations and preliminary analyses of course did not decide the merits of this questionas evidenced by the disagreement among the lower courts on this issue. Compare <i>Eisenberg,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 133, with <i>Comfort,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 13.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent also asserts that these cases are controlled by <i>Grutter,</i> claiming that the existence of a compelling interest in these cases \"follows <i>a fortiori</i>\" from <i>Grutter, post,</i> at 41, 64-66, and accusing us of tacitly overruling that case, see <i>post,</i> at 64-66. The dissent overreads <i>Grutter,</i> however, in suggesting that it renders pure racial balancing a constitutionally compelling interest; <i>Grutter</i> itself recognized that using race simply to achieve racial balance would be \"patently unconstitutional,\" 539 U. S.<i>,</i> at 330. The Court was exceedingly careful in describing the interest furthered in <i>Grutter</i> as \"not an interest in simple ethnic diversity\" but rather a \"far broader array of qualifications and characteristics\" in which race was but a single element. 539 U. S., at 324-325 (internal quotation marks omitted). We take the <i>Grutter</i> Court at its word. We simply do not understand how JUSTICE</p>\n<p>BREYER can maintain that classifying every schoolchild as black or white, and using that classification as a determinative factor in assigning children to achieve pure racial balance, can be regarded as \"less burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored\" than the consideration of race in <i>Grutter, post,</i> at 47, when the Court in <i>Grutter</i> stated that \"[t]he importance of . . . individualized consideration\" in the program was \"paramount,\" and consideration of race was one factor in a \"highly individualized, holistic review.\" 539 U. S., at 337. Certainly if the constitutionality of the stark use of race in these cases were as established as the dissent would have it, there would have been no need for the extensive analysis undertaken in <i>Grutter.</i> In light of the foregoing, JUSTICE BREYER's appeal to <i>stare decisis</i> rings particularly hollow. See <i>post,</i> at 65-66.</p>\n<p>At the same time it relies on inapplicable desegregation cases, misstatements of admitted dicta, and other noncontrolling pronouncements, JUSTICE BREYER's dissent candidly dismisses the significance of this Court's repeated <i>holdings</i> that all racial classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny, see <i>post,</i> at 31-33, 35-36, arguing that a different standard of review should be applied because the districts use race for beneficent rather than malicious purposes, see <i>post,</i> at 31-36.</p>\n<p>This Court has recently reiterated, however, that \"`<i>all</i> racial classifications [imposed by government] . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.' \" <i>Johnson,</i> 543 U. S., at 505 (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227; emphasis added by <i>Johnson</i> Court). See also <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 326 (\"[G]overnmental action based on race  a group classification long recognized as in most circum-stances irrelevant and therefore prohibitedshould be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry\" (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)). JUSTICE BREYER nonetheless relies on the good intentions and motives of the school districts, stating that he has found \"no case that . . . repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to <i>exclude</i> and that which seeks to <i>include</i> members of minority races.\" <i>Post,</i> at 29 (emphasis in original). We have found many. Our cases clearly reject the argument that motives affect the strict scrutiny analysis. See <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 505 (\"We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called `benign' racial classifications\"); <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227 (rejecting idea that \"`benign'\" racial classifications may be held to \"different standard\"); <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 500 (\"Racial classifications are suspect, and that means that simple legislative assurances of good intention cannot suffice\").</p>\n<p>This argument that different rules should govern racial classifications designed to include rather than exclude is not new; it has been repeatedly pressed in the past, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Gratz,</i> 539 U. S., at 282 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 301 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 243 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 316-317 (STEVENS, J., dissenting), and has been repeatedly rejected. See also <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 289-291 (opinion of Powell, J.) (rejecting argument that strict scrutiny should be applied only to classifications that disadvantage minorities, stating \"[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination\").</p>\n<p>The reasons for rejecting a motives test for racial classifications are clear enough. \"The Court's emphasis on `benign racial classifications' suggests confidence in its ability to distinguish good from harmful governmental uses of racial criteria. History should teach greater humility.. . . `[B]enign' carries with it no independent meaning, but reflects only acceptance of the current generation's conclusion that a politically acceptable burden, imposed on particular citizens on the basis of race, is reasonable.\" <i>Metro Broadcasting,</i> 497 U. S., at 609-610 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). See also <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 226 (\"`[I]t may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign'\" (quoting <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 298 (opinion of Powell, J.))). Accepting JUSTICE BREYER's approach would \"do no more than move us from `separate but equal' to `unequal but benign.'\" <i>Metro Broadcasting, supra,</i> at 638 (KENN-EDY, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER speaks of bringing \"the races\" together (putting aside the purely black-and-white nature of the plans), as the justification for excluding individuals on the basis of their race. See <i>post,</i> at 28-29. Again, this approach to racial classifications is fundamentally at odds with our precedent, which makes clear that the Equal Protection Clause \"protect[s] <i>persons,</i> not <i>groups,</i>\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227 (emphasis in original). See <i>ibid.</i> (\"[A]ll governmental action based on racea <i>group</i> classification long recognized as `in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited,' <i>Hirabayashi</i> [v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103875\"><a href=\"/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 100 (1943)]should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the <i>personal</i> right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed\" (first emphasis in original); <i>Metro Broadcasting, supra,</i> at 636 (\"[O]ur Constitution protects each citizen as an individual, not as a member of a group\" (KENNEDY, J., dissenting)); <i>Bakke, supra,</i> at 289 (opinion of Powell, J.) (Fourteenth Amendment creates rights \"guaranteed to the individual. The rights established are personal rights\"). This fundamental principle goes back, in this context, to <i>Brown</i> itself. See <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span>, 300 (1955) (<i>Brown II</i>) (\"At stake is the <i>personal</i> interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools . . . on a nondiscriminatory basis\" (emphasis added)). For the dissent, in contrast, \"`individualized scrutiny' is simply beside the point.\" <i>Post,</i> at 55.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's position comes down to a familiar claim: The end justifies the means. He admits that \"there is a cost in applying `a state-mandated racial label,'\" <i>post,</i> at 67, but he is confident that the cost is worth paying. Our established strict scrutiny test for racial classifications, however, insists on \"detailed examination, both as to ends <i>and</i> as to means.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 236 (emphasis added). Simply because the school districts may seek a worthy goal does not mean they are free to discriminate on the basis of race to achieve it, or that their racial classifications should be subject to less exacting scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Despite his argument that these cases should be evaluated under a \"standard of review that is not `strict' in the traditional sense of that word,\" <i>post,</i> at 36, JUSTICE</p>\n<p>BREYER still purports to apply strict scrutiny to these cases. See <i>post,</i> at 37. It is evident, however, that JUSTICE BREYER's brand of narrow tailoring is quite unlike anything found in our precedents. Without any detailed discussion of the operation of the plans, the students who are affected, or the districts' failure to consider race-neutral alternatives, the dissent concludes that the districts have shown that these racial classifications are necessary to achieve the districts' stated goals. This conclusion is divorced from any evaluation of the actual impact of the plans at issue in these casesother than to note that the plans \"often have no effect.\" <i>Post,</i> at 46.<sup>[17]</sup> Instead, the dissent suggests that some combination of the development of these plans over time, the difficulty of the endeavor, and the good faith of the districts suffices to demonstrate that these stark and controlling racial classifications are constitutional. The Constitution and our precedents require more.</p>\n<p>In keeping with his view that strict scrutiny should not apply, JUSTICE BREYER repeatedly urges deference to local school boards on these issues. See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 21, 48-49, 66. Such deference \"is fundamentally at odds with our equal protection jurisprudence. We put the burden on state actors to demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 543 U. S., at 506, n. 1. See <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 501 (\"The history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis\"); <i>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Barnette,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 637 (1943) (\"The Fourteenth Amendment . . . protects the citizen against the State itself and all of its creaturesBoards of Education not excepted\").</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER's dissent ends on an unjustified note of alarm. It predicts that today's decision \"threaten[s]\" the validity of \"[h]undreds of state and federal statutes and regulations.\" <i>Post,</i> at 61; see also <i>post,</i> at 27-28. But the examples the dissent mentionsfor example, a provision of the No Child Left Behind Act that requires States to set measurable objectives to track the achievement of students from major racial and ethnic groups, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §6311(b)(2)(C)(v)have nothing to do with the pertinent issues in these cases.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BREYER also suggests that other means for achieving greater racial diversity in schools are necessarily unconstitutional if the racial classifications at issue in these cases cannot survive strict scrutiny. <i>Post,</i> at 58-62. These other means<i>e.g.,</i> where to construct new schools, how to allocate resources among schools, and which academic offerings to provide to attract students to certain schoolsimplicate different considerations than the explicit racial classifications at issue in these cases, and we express no opinion on their validitynot even in dicta. Rather, we employ the familiar and well-established analytic approach of strict scrutiny to evaluate the plans at issue today, an approach that in no way warrants the dissent's cataclysmic concerns. Under that approach, the school districts have not carried their burden of showing that the ends they seek justify the particular extreme means they have chosenclassifying individual students on the basis of their race and discriminating among them on that basis.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>If the need for the racial classifications embraced by the school districts is unclear, even on the districts' own terms, the costs are undeniable. \"[D]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 214 (internal quotation marks omitted). Government action dividing us by race is inherently suspect because such classifications promote \"notions of racial inferiority and lead to a politics of racial hostility,\" <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 493, \"reinforce the belief, held by too many for too much of our history, that individuals should be judged by the color of their skin,\" <i>Shaw</i> v. <i>Reno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span>, 657 (1993), and \"endorse race-based reasoning and the conception of a Nation divided into racial blocs, thus contributing to an escalation of racial hostility and conflict.\" <i>Metro Broadcasting,</i> 497 U. S., at 603 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). As the Court explained in <i>Rice</i> v. <i>Cayetano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118340\"><a href=\"/opinion/118340/rice-v-cayetano/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">495</span></a></span>, 517 (2000), \"[o]ne of the principal reasons race is treated as a forbidden classification is that it demeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.\"</p>\n<p>All this is true enough in the contexts in which these statements were madegovernment contracting, voting districts, allocation of broadcast licenses, and electing state officersbut when it comes to using race to assign children to schools, history will be heard. In <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1954) (<i>Brown I</i>), we held that segregation deprived black children of equal educational opportunities regardless of whether school facilities and other tangible factors were equal, because government classification and separation on grounds of race themselves denoted inferiority. <i>Id.,</i> at 493-494. It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954. See <i>id.,</i> at 494 (\"`The impact [of segregation] is greater when it has the sanction of the law' \"). The next Term, we accordingly stated that \"full compliance\" with <i>Brown I</i> required school districts \"to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools <i>on a nonracial basis.</i>\" <i>Brown II,</i> 349 U. S., at 300-301 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The parties and their <i>amici</i> debate which side is more faithful to the heritage of <i>Brown,</i> but the position of the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> was spelled out in their brief and could not have been clearer: \"[T]he Fourteenth Amendment prevents states from according differential treatment to American children on the basis of their color or race.\" Brief for Appellants in Nos. 1, 2, and 4 and for Respondents in No. 10 on Reargument in <i>Brown I,</i> O. T. 1953, p. 15 (Summary of Argument). What do the racial classifications at issue here do, if not accord differential treatment on the basis of race? As counsel who appeared before this Court for the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> put it: \"We have one fundamental contention which we will seek to develop in the course of this argument, and that contention is that no State has any authority under the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to use race as a factor in affording educational opportunities among its citizens.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in <i>Brown I,</i> p. 7 (Robert L. Carter, Dec. 9, 1952). There is no ambiguity in that statement. And it was that position that prevailed in this Court, which emphasized in its remedial opinion that what was \"[a]t stake is the personal interest of the plaintiffs in admission to public schools as soon as practicable <i>on a nondiscriminatory basis,</i>\" and what was required was \"determining admission to the public schools <i>on a non-racial basis.</i>\" <i>Brown II, supra,</i> at 300-301 (emphasis added). What do the racial classifications do in these cases, if not determine admission to a public school on a racial basis?</p>\n<p>Before <i>Brown,</i> schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once againeven for very different reasons. For schools that never segregated on the basis of race, such as Seattle, or that have removed the vestiges of past segregation, such as Jefferson County, the way \"to achieve a system of determining admission to the public schools on a nonracial basis,\" <i>Brown II,</i> 349 U. S., at 300-301, is to stop assigning students on a racial basis. The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.</p>\n<p>The judgments of the Courts of Appeals for the Sixth and Ninth Circuits are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<p>JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>Today, the Court holds that state entities may not experiment with race-based means to achieve ends they deem socially desirable. I wholly concur in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion. I write separately to address several of the contentions in JUSTICE BREYER's dissent (hereinafter the dissent). Contrary to the dissent's arguments, reseg-regation is not occurring in Seattle or Louisville; these school boards have no present interest in remedying past segregation; and these race-based student-assignment programs do not serve any compelling state interest. Accordingly, the plans are unconstitutional. Disfavoring a color-blind interpretation of the Constitution, the dissent would give school boards a free hand to make decisions on the basis of racean approach reminiscent of that advocated by the segregationists in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> 347 U. S 483 (1954). This approach is just as wrong today as it was a half-century ago. The Constitution and our cases require us to be much more demanding before permitting local school boards to make decisions based on race.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The dissent repeatedly claims that the school districts are threatened with resegregation and that they will succumb to that threat if these plans are declared unconstitutional. It also argues that these plans can be justified as part of the school boards' attempts to \"eradicat[e] earlier school segregation.\" See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 4. Contrary to the dissent's rhetoric, neither of these school districts is threatened with resegregation, and neither is constitutionally compelled or permitted to undertake race-based remediation. Racial imbalance is not segregation, and the mere incantation of terms like resegregation and remediation cannot make up the difference.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>Because this Court has authorized and required race-based remedial measures to address <i>de jure</i> segregation, it is important to define segregation clearly and to distinguish it from racial imbalance. In the context of public schooling, segregation is the deliberate operation of a school system to \"carry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\" <i>Swann </i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1971); see also <i>Monroe</i> v. <i>Board of Comm'rs of Jackson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107707\"><a href=\"/opinion/107707/monroe-v-board-of-commrs-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>, 452 (1968).

Because racial imbalance is not inevitably linked to unconstitutional segregation, it is not unconstitutional in and of itself. <i>Dayton Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Brinkman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109728\"><a href=\"/opinion/109728/dayton-bd-of-ed-v-brinkman/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 413 (1977); <i>Dayton Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Brinkman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110142\"><a href=\"/opinion/110142/dayton-bd-of-ed-v-brinkman/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span>, 531, n. 5 (1979) (\"Racial imbalance. . . is not <i>per se</i> a constitutional violation\"); <i>Freeman </i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 494 (1992); see also <i>Swann, supra,</i> at 31-32; cf. <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109102\"><a href=\"/opinion/109102/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 740-741, and n. 19 (1974).</p>\n<p>Although there is arguably a danger of racial imbalance in schools in Seattle and Louisville, there is no danger of resegregation. No one contends that Seattle has established or that Louisville has reestablished a dual school system that separates students on the basis of race. The statistics cited in Appendix A to the dissent are not to the contrary. See <i>post,</i> at 69-72. At most, those statistics show a national trend toward classroom racial imbalance. However, racial imbalance without intentional state action to separate the races does not amount to segregation. To raise the specter of resegregation to defend these programs is to ignore the meaning of the word and the nature of the cases before us.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Just as the school districts lack an interest in preventing resegregation, they also have no present interest in remedying past segregation. The Constitution generally prohibits government race-based decisionmaking, but this Court has authorized the use of race-based measures for remedial purposes in two narrowly defined circumstances. First, in schools that were formerly segregated by law, race-based measures are sometimes constitutionally compelled to remedy prior school segregation. Second, in <i>Croson,</i> the Court appeared willing to authorize a government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible. <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 504 (1989). Without explicitly resting on either of these strands of doctrine, the dissent repeatedly invokes the school districts' supposed interests in remedying past segregation. Properly analyzed, though, these plans do not fall within either existing category of permissible racebased remediation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>The Constitution does not permit race-based government decisionmaking simply because a school district claims a remedial purpose and proceeds in good faith with arguably pure motives. <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 371 (2003) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 239 (1995) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)). Rather, race-based government decisionmaking is categorically prohibited unless narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest. <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 326; see also Part II-A, <i>infra.</i> This exacting scrutiny \"has proven automatically fatal\" in most cases. <i>Jenkins, supra,</i> at 121 (THOMAS, J., concurring); cf. <i>Hirabayashi</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103875\"><a href=\"/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 100 (1943) (\"[R]acial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited\"). And appropriately so. \"The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 353 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Therefore, as a general rule, all race-based government decisionmakingregardless of contextis unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>This Court has carved out a narrow exception to that general rule for cases in which a school district has a \"history of maintaining two sets of schools in a single school system deliberately operated to carry out a governmental policy to separate pupils in schools solely on the basis of race.\"<sup>[4]</sup> See <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 5-6. In such cases, race-based remedial measures are sometimes required.<sup>[5]</sup><i>Green,</i> 391 U. S., at 437-438; cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Fordice,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112782\"><a href=\"/opinion/112782/united-states-v-fordice/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 745 (1992) (THOMAS, J., concurring).<sup>[6]</sup> But without a history of state-enforced racial separation, a school district has no affirmative legal obligation to take race-based remedial measures to eliminate segregation and its vestiges.</p>\n<p>Neither of the programs before us today is compelled as a remedial measure, and no one makes such a claim. Seattle has no history of <i>de jure</i> segregation; therefore, the Constitution did not require Seattle's plan.<sup>[7]</sup> Although Louisville once operated a segregated school system and was subject to a Federal District Court's desegregation decree, see <i>ante,</i> at 7; <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419867\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419867/hampton-v-jefferson-county-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, 376-377 (WD Ky. 2000), that decree was dissolved in 2000, <i>id.,</i> at 360. Since then, no race-based remedial measures have been required in Louisville. Thus, the race-based student-assignment plan at issue here, which was instituted the year after the dissolution of the desegregation decree, was not even arguably required by the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Aside from constitutionally compelled remediation in schools, this Court has permitted government units to remedy prior racial discrimination only in narrow circumstances. See <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion). Regardless of the constitutional validity of such remediation, see <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 524-525 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), it does not apply here. Again, neither school board asserts that its race-based actions were taken to remedy prior discrimination. Seattle provides three forward-lookingas opposed to remedialjustifications for its race-based assignment plan. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, pp. 24-34. Louisville asserts several similar forward-looking interests, Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, pp. 24-29, and at oral argument, counsel for Louisville disavowed any claim that Louisville's argument \"depend[ed] in any way on the prior de jure segregation,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 05-915, p. 38.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, for a government unit to remedy past discrimination for which it was responsible, the Court has required it to demonstrate \"a `strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary.'\" <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 500 (quoting <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 277 (plurality opinion)). Establishing a \"strong basis in evidence\" requires proper findings regarding the extent of the government unit's past racial discrimination. <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 504. The findings should \"define the scope of any injury [and] the necessary remedy,\" <i>id.,</i> at 505, and must be more than \"inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs,\" <i>id.,</i> at 506. Assertions of general societal discrimination are plainly insufficient. <i>Id.,</i> at 499, 504; <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 274 (plurality opinion); cf. <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 310 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Neither school district has made any such specific findings. For Seattle, the dissent attempts to make up for this failing by adverting to allegations made in past complaints filed against the Seattle school district. However, allegations in complaints cannot substitute for specific findings of prior discriminationeven when those allegations lead to settlements with complaining parties. Cf. <i>Croson, supra,</i> at 505; <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 279, n. 5 (plurality opinion). As for Louisville, its slate was cleared by the District Court's 2000 dissolution decree, which effectively declared that there were no longer any effects of <i>de jure</i> discrimination in need of remediation.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>Despite the dissent's repeated intimation of a remedial purpose, neither of the programs in question qualifies as a permissible race-based remedial measure. Thus, the programs are subject to the general rule that government race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>As the foregoing demonstrates, racial balancing is some-times a constitutionally permissible remedy for the discrete legal wrong of <i>de jure</i> segregation, and when directed to that end, racial balancing is an exception to the general rule that government race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional. Perhaps for this reason, the dissent conflates the concepts of segregation and racial imbalance: If racial imbalance equates to segregation, then it must also be constitutionally acceptable to use racial balancing to remedy racial imbalance.</p>\n<p>For at least two reasons, however, it is wrong to place the remediation of segregation on the same plane as the remediation of racial imbalance. First, as demonstrated above, the two concepts are distinct. Although racial imbalance can result from <i>de jure</i> segregation, it does not necessarily, and the further we get from the era of state  sponsored racial separation, the less likely it is that racial imbalance has a traceable connection to any prior segregation. See <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 496; <i>Jenkins,</i> 515 U. S., at 118 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>Second, a school cannot \"remedy\" racial imbalance in the same way that it can remedy segregation. Remediation of past <i>de jure</i> segregation is a one-time process involving the redress of a discrete legal injury inflicted by an identified entity. At some point, the discrete injury will be remedied, and the school district will be declared unitary. See <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 31. Unlike <i>de jure</i> segregation, there is no ultimate remedy for racial imbalance. Individual schools will fall in and out of balance in the natural course, and the appropriate balance itself will shift with a school district's changing demographics. Thus, racial balancing will have to take place on an indefinite basisa continuous process with no identifiable culpable party and no discernable end point. In part for those reasons, the Court has never permitted outright racial balancing solely for the purpose of achieving a particular racial balance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Lacking a cognizable interest in remediation, neither of these plans can survive strict scrutiny because neither plan serves a genuinely compelling state interest. The dissent avoids reaching that conclusion by unquestioningly accepting the assertions of selected social scientists while completely ignoring the fact that those assertions are the subject of fervent debate. Ultimately, the dissent's entire analysis is corrupted by the considerations that lead it initially to question whether strict scrutiny should apply at all. What emerges is a version of \"strict scrutiny\" that combines hollow assurances of harmlessness with reflexive acceptance of conventional wisdom. When it comes to government race-based decisionmaking, the Constitution demands more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The dissent claims that \"the law requires application here of a standard of review that is not `strict' in the traditional sense of that word.\" <i>Post,</i> at 36. This view is informed by dissents in our previous cases and the concurrences of two Court of Appeals judges. <i>Post,</i> at 34-36 (citing <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792253\"><a href=\"/opinion/792253/parents-involved-in-community-schools-a-washington-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1193-1194 (CA9 2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring); <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 28-29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring)). Those lower court judges reasoned that programs like these are not \"aimed at oppressing blacks\" and do not \"seek to give one racial group an edge over another.\" <i>Comfort, supra,</i> at 27 (Boudin, C. J., concurring); <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1193 (Kozinski, J., concurring). They were further persuaded that these plans differed from other race-based programs this Court has considered because they are \"certainly more benign than laws that favor or disfavor one race, segregate by race, or create quotas for or against a racial group,\" <i>Comfort,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 28 (Boudin, C. J., concurring), and they are \"far from the original evils at which the Fourteenth Amendment was addressed,\" <i>id.,</i> at 29; <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1195 (Kozinski, J., concurring). Instead of strict scrutiny, Judge Kozinski would have analyzed the plans under \"robust and realistic rational basis review.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 1194.</p>\n<p>These arguments are inimical to the Constitution and to this Court's precedents.<sup>[9]</sup> We have made it unusually clear that strict scrutiny applies to <i>every</i> racial classification. <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227; <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 326; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 505 (2005) (\"We have insisted on strict scrutiny in every context, even for so-called `benign' racial classifications\").<sup>[10]</sup> There are good reasons not to apply a lesser standard to these cases. The constitutional problems with government race-based decisionmaking are not diminished in the slightest by the presence or absence of an intent to oppress any race or by the real or asserted well-meaning motives for the race-based decisionmaking. <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 228-229. Purportedly benign race-based decisionmaking suffers the same constitutional infirmity as invidious race-based decisionmaking. <i>Id.,</i> at 240 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"As far as the Constitution is concerned, it is irrelevant whether a government's racial classifications are drawn by those who wish to oppress a race or by those who have a sincere desire to help those thought to be disadvantaged\").</p>\n<p>Even supposing it mattered to the constitutional analysis, the race-based student assignment programs before us are not as benign as the dissent believes. See <i>post,</i> at 34-35. \"[R]acial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). As these programs demonstrate, every time the government uses racial criteria to \"bring the races together,\" <i>post,</i> at 29, someone gets excluded, and the person excluded suffers an injury solely because of his or her race. The petitioner in the Louisville case received a letter from the school board informing her that her <i>kindergartener</i> would not be allowed to attend the school of petitioner's choosing because of the child's race. App. in No. 05-915, p. 97. Doubtless, hundreds of letters like this went out from both school boards every year these racebased assignment plans were in operation. This type of exclusion, solely on the basis of race, is precisely the sort of government action that pits the races against one another, exacerbates racial tension, and \"provoke[s] resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government's use of race.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 241 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Accordingly, these plans are simply one more variation on the government race-based decisionmaking we have consistently held must be subjected to strict scrutiny. <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 326.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>Though the dissent admits to discomfort in applying strict scrutiny to these plans, it claims to have nonetheless applied that exacting standard. But in its search for a compelling interest, the dissent casually accepts even the most tenuous interests asserted on behalf of the plans, grouping them all under the term \"`integration.'\" See <i>post,</i> at 37. \"`[I]ntegration,'\" we are told, has \"three essential elements.\" <i>Ibid.</i> None of these elements is compelling. And the combination of the three unsubstantiated elements does not produce an interest any more compelling than that represented by each element independently.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1</h2>\n<p>According to the dissent, integration involves \"an interest in setting right the consequences of prior conditions of segregation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 37. For the reasons explained above, the records in these cases do not demonstrate that either school board's plan is supported by an interest in remedying past discrimination. Part IB, <i>supra.</i> Moreover, the school boards have no interest in remedying the sundry consequences of prior segregation unrelated to schooling, such as \"housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes.\" <i>Post,</i> at 38. General claims that past school segregation affected such varied societal trends are \"too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy,\" <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 276 (plurality opinion), because \"[i]t is sheer speculation\" how decades-past segregation in the school system might have affected these trends, see <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 499. Consequently, school boards seeking to remedy those societal problems with race-based measures in schools today would have no way to gauge the proper scope of the remedy. <i>Id.,</i> at 498. Indeed, remedial measures geared toward such broad and unrelated societal ills have \"`no logical stopping point,'\" <i>ibid.,</i> and threaten to become \"ageless in their reach into the past, and timeless in their ability to affect the future,\" <i>Wygant, supra,</i> at 276 (plurality opinion). See <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 342 (stating the \"requirement that all governmental use of race must have a logical end point\").</p>\n<p>Because the school boards lack any further interest in remedying segregation, this element offers no support for the purported interest in \"integration.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2</h2>\n<p>Next, the dissent argues that the interest in integration has an educational element. The dissent asserts that racially balanced schools improve educational outcomes for black children. In support, the dissent unquestioningly cites certain social science research to support propositions that are hotly disputed among social scientists. In reality, it is far from apparent that coerced racial mixing has any educational benefits, much less that integration is necessary to black achievement.</p>\n<p>Scholars have differing opinions as to whether educational benefits arise from racial balancing. Some have concluded that black students receive genuine educational benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Crain &amp; Mahard, Desegregation and Black Achievement: A Review of the Research, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Lans. Ch.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>&amp; Contemp. Probs. 17, 48 (1978). Others have been more circumspect. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Henderson, Greenberg, Schneider, Uribe, &amp; Verdugo, High Quality Schooling for African American Students, in Beyond Desegregation 166 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996) (\"Perhaps desegregation does not have a single effect, positive or negative, on the academic achievement of African American students, but rather some strategies help, some hurt, and still others make no difference whatsoever. It is clear to us that focusing simply on demographic issues detracts from focusing on improving schools\"). And some have concluded that there are no demonstrable educational benefits. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Armor &amp; Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line: New Perspectives on Race and Ethnicity in America 239, 251 (A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom eds. 2002).</p>\n<p>The <i>amicus</i> briefs in the cases before us mirror this divergence of opinion. Supporting the school boards, one <i>amicus</i> has assured us that \"both early desegregation research and recent statistical and econometric analyses. . . indicate that there are positive effects on minority student achievement scores arising from diverse school settings.\" Brief for American Educational Research Association as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10. Another brief claims that \"school desegregation has a modest positive impact on the achievement of African-American students.\" App. to Brief for 553 Social Scientists as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 13-14 (footnote omitted). Yet neither of those briefs contains specific details like the magnitude of the claimed positive effects or the precise demographic mix at which those positive effects begin to be realized. Indeed, the social scientists' brief rather cautiously claims the existence of any benefit at all, describing the \"positive impact\" as \"modest,\" <i>id.,</i> at 13, acknowledging that \"there appears to be little or no effect on math scores,\" <i>id.,</i> at 14, and admitting that the \"underlying reasons for these gains in achievement are not entirely clear,\" <i>id.,</i> at 15.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Other <i>amici</i> dispute these findings. One <i>amicus</i> reports that \"[i]n study after study, racial composition of a student body, when isolated, proves to be an insignificant determinant of student achievement.\" Brief for Dr. John Murphy et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> in No. 05-908, p. 8; see also <i>id.,</i> at 9 (\"[T]here is no evidence that diversity in the K-12 class-room positively affects student achievement\"). Another <i>amicus</i> surveys several social science studies and concludes that \"a fair and comprehensive analysis of the research shows that there is no clear and consistent evidence of [educational] benefits.\" Brief for David J. Armor et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 29.</p>\n<p>Add to the inconclusive social science the fact of black achievement in \"racially isolated\" environments. See T. Sowell, Education: Assumptions Versus History 7-38 (1986). Before <i>Brown,</i> the most prominent example of an exemplary black school was Dunbar High School. <i>Id.,</i> at 29 (\"[I]n the period 1918-1923, Dunbar graduates earned fifteen degrees from Ivy League colleges, and ten degrees from Amherst, Williams, and Wesleyan\"). Dunbar is by no means an isolated example. See <i>id.,</i> at 10-32 (discussing other successful black schools); Walker, Can Institutions Care? Evidence from the Segregated Schooling of African American Children, in Beyond Desegregation 209-226 (M. Shujaa ed. 1996); see also T. Sowell, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study 141-165 (2004). Even after <i>Brown,</i> some schools with predominantly black enrollments have achieved outstanding educational results. See, <i>e.g.,</i> S. Carter, No Excuses: Lessons from 21 High-Performing, High-Poverty Schools 49-50, 53-56, 71-73, 81-84, 87-88 (2001); A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom, No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning 43-64 (2003); see also L. Izumi, They Have Overcome: HighP-overty, High-Performing Schools in California (2002) (chronicling exemplary achievement in predominantly Hispanic schools in California). There is also evidence that black students attending historically black colleges achieve better academic results than those attending predominantly white colleges. <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 364-365 (in part and concurring in judgment) (citing sources); see also <i>Fordice,</i> 505 U. S., at 748-749 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>The Seattle school board itself must believe that racial mixing is not necessary to black achievement. Seattle operates a K-8 \"African-American Academy,\" which has a \"nonwhite\" enrollment of 99%. See App. in No. 05-908, p. 227a; Reply Brief in No. 05-908, p. 13, n. 13. That school was founded in 1990 as part of the school board's effort to \"increase academic achievement.\"<sup>[12]</sup> See African American Academy History, online at http://www. seattleschools.org/schools/aaa/history.htm (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file). According to the school's most recent annual report, \"[a]cademic excellence\" is its \"primary goal.\" See African American Academy 2006 Annual Report, p. 2, online at http://www.seattleschools.org/area/ siso/reports/anrep/altern/938.pdf. This racially imbalanced environment has reportedly produced test scores \"higher across all grade levels in reading, writing and math.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Contrary to what the dissent would have predicted, see <i>post,</i> at 38-39, the children in Seattle's African American Academy have shown gains when placed in a \"highly segregated\" environment.</p>\n<p>Given this tenuous relationship between forced racial mixing and improved educational results for black children, the dissent cannot plausibly maintain that an educational element supports the integration interest, let alone makes it compelling.<sup>[13]</sup> See <i>Jenkins,</i> 515 U. S., at 121-122 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (\"[T]here is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment\").</p>\n<p>Perhaps recognizing as much, the dissent argues that the social science evidence is \"strong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.\" <i>Post,</i> at 38. This assertion is inexplicable. It is not up to the school boardsthe very government entities whose race-based practices we must strictly scrutinizeto determine what interests qualify as compelling under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Rather, this Court must assess independently the nature of the interest asserted and the evidence to support it in order to determine whether it qualifies as compelling under our precedents. In making such a determination, we have deferred to state authorities only once, see <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 328-330, and that deference was prompted by factors uniquely relevant to higher education. <i>Id.,</i> at 328 (\"Our holding today is in keeping with our tradition of giving a degree of deference to a university's academic decisions\"). The dissent's proposed testwhether sufficient social science evidence supports a government unit's conclusion that the interest it asserts is compellingcalls to mind the rational-basis standard of review the dissent purports not to apply, <i>post,</i> at 36-37. See <i>Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105285\"><a href=\"/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-okla-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, 488 (1955) (\"It is enough that there is an evil at hand for correction, and that it might be thought that the particular legislative measure was a rational way to correct it\"). Furthermore, it would leave our equal-protection jurisprudence at the mercy of elected government officials evaluating the evanescent views of a handful of social scientists. To adopt the dissent's deferential approach would be to abdicate our constitutional responsibilities.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3</h2>\n<p>Finally, the dissent asserts a \"democratic element\" to the integration interest. It defines the \"democratic element\" as \"an interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the `pluralistic society' in which our children will live.\" <i>Post,</i> at 39.<sup>[15]</sup> Environmental reflection, though, is just another way to say racial balancing. And \"[p]referring members of any one group for no reason other than race or ethnic origin is discrimination for its own sake.\" <i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 307 (opinion of Powell, J.). \"This the Constitution forbids.\" <i>Ibid.; </i><i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 329-330; <i>Freeman,</i> 503 U. S., at 494.</p>\n<p>Navigating around that inconvenient authority, the dissent argues that the racial balancing in these plans is not an end in itself but is instead intended to \"teac[h] children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 39-40. These \"generic lessons in socialization and good citizenship\" are too sweeping to qualify as compelling interests. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 348 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). And they are not \"uniquely relevant\" to schools or \"uniquely `teachable' in a formal educational setting.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 347. Therefore, if governments may constitutionally use racial balancing to achieve these aspirational ends in schools, they may use racial balancing to achieve similar goals at every levelfrom state-sponsored 4-H clubs, see <i>Bazemore</i> v. <i>Friday,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111746\"><a href=\"/opinion/111746/bazemore-v-friday/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 388-390 (1986) (Brennan, J., concurring), to the state civil service. See <i>Grutter,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span>347-348 (opinion of SCALIA, J.).</p>\n<p>Moreover, the democratic interest has no durational limit, contrary to <i>Grutter</i>'s command. See <i>id.,</i> at 342; see also <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 498; <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 275 (plurality opinion). In other words, it will always be important for students to learn cooperation among the races. If this interest justifies race-conscious measures today, then logically it will justify race-conscious measures forever. Thus, the democratic interest, limitless in scope and \"timeless in [its] ability to affect the future,\" <i>id.,</i> at 276 (plurality opinion), cannot justify government race-based decisionmaking.<sup>[16]</sup></p>\n<p>In addition to these defects, the democratic element of the integration interest fails on the dissent's own terms. The dissent again relies upon social science research to support the proposition that state-compelled racial mixing teaches children to accept cooperation and improves racial attitudes and race relations. Here again, though, the dissent overstates the data that supposedly support the interest.</p>\n<p>The dissent points to data that indicate that \"black and white students in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those in segregated schools.\" <i>Post,</i> at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted). By the dissent's account, improvements in racial attitudes depend upon the increased contact between black and white students thought to occur in more racially balanced schools. There is no guarantee, however, that students of different races in the same school will actually spend time with one another. Schools frequently group students by academic ability as an aid to efficient instruction, but such groupings often result in classrooms with high concentrations of one race or another. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Yonezawa, Wells, &amp; Serna, Choosing Tracks: \"Freedom of Choice\" in Detracting Schools, 39 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 1, p. 38 (Spring 2002); Mickelson, Subverting Swann: First- and Second-Generation Segregation in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, 38 Am. Ed. Research J., No. 2, pp. 233-234 (Summer 2001) (describing this effect in schools in Charlotte, North Carolina). In addition to classroom separation, students of different races within the same school may separate themselves socially. See Hallinan &amp; Williams, Interracial Friendship Choices in Secondary Schools, 54 Am. Sociological Rev., No. 1, pp. 72-76 (Feb. 1989); see also Clotfelter, Interracial Contact in High School Extracurricular Activities, 34 Urban Rev., No. 1, pp. 41-43 (Mar. 2002). Therefore, even supposing interracial contact leads directly to improvements in racial attitudes and race relations, a program that assigns students of different races to the same schools might not capture those benefits. Simply putting students together under the same roof does not necessarily mean that the students will learn together or even interact.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is unclear whether increased interracial contact improves racial attitudes and relations.<sup>[17]</sup> One researcher has stated that \"the reviews of desegregation and intergroup relations were unable to come to any conclusion about what the probable effects of desegregation were . . . [;] virtually all of the reviewers determined that few, if any, firm conclusions about the impact of desegregation on intergroup relations could be drawn.\" Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations: A Review of the Literature, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. Grant ed. 1991). Some studies have even found that a deterioration in racial attitudes seems to result from racial mixing in schools. See N. St. John, School Desegregation Outcomes for Children 67-68 (1975) (\"A glance at [the data] shows that for either race positive findings are less common than negative findings\"); Stephan, The Effects of School Desegregation: An Evaluation 30 Years After Brown, in Advances in Applied Social Psychology 183-186 (M. Saks &amp; L. Saxe eds. 1986). Therefore, it is not nearly as apparent as the dissent suggests that increased interracial exposure automatically leads to improved racial attitudes or race relations.</p>\n<p>Given our case law and the paucity of evidence supporting the dissent's belief that these plans improve race relations, no democratic element can support the integration interest.<sup>[18]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4</h2>\n<p>The dissent attempts to buttress the integration interest by claiming that it follows <i>a fortiori</i> from the interest this Court recognized as compelling in <i>Grutter. Post,</i> at 41. Regardless of the merit of <i>Grutter,</i> the compelling interest recognized in that case cannot support these plans. <i>Grutter</i> recognized a compelling interest in a law school's attainment of a diverse student body. 539 U. S., at 328. This interest was critically dependent upon features unique to higher education: \"the expansive freedoms of speech and thought associated with the university environment,\" the \"special niche in our constitutional tradition\" occupied by universities, and \"[t]he freedom of a university to make its own judgments as to education[,] includ[ing] the selection of its student body.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 329 (internal quotation marks omitted). None of these features is present in elementary and secondary schools. Those schools do not select their own students, and education in the elementary and secondary environment generally does not involve the free interchange of ideas thought to be an integral part of higher education. See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1208 (Bea, J., dissenting). Extending <i>Grutter</i> to this context would require us to cut that holding loose from its theoretical moorings. Thus, only by ignoring <i>Grutter</i>'s reasoning can the dissent claim that recognizing a compelling interest in these cases is an <i>a fortiori</i> application of <i>Grutter.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>Stripped of the baseless and novel interests the dissent asserts on their behalf, the school boards cannot plausibly maintain that their plans further a compelling interest. As I explained in <i>Grutter,</i> only \"those measures the State must take to provide a bulwark against anarchy . . . or to prevent violence\" and \"a government's effort to remedy past discrimination for which it is responsible\" constitute compelling interests. 539 U. S., at 351-352, 353. Neither of the parties has arguednor could theythat race-based student assignment is necessary to provide a bulwark against anarchy or to prevent violence. And as I explained above, the school districts have no remedial interest in pursuing these programs. See Part IB, <i>supra.</i> Accordingly, the school boards cannot satisfy strict scrutiny. These plans are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>Most of the dissent's criticisms of today's result can be traced to its rejection of the color-blind Constitution. See <i>post,</i> at 29. The dissent attempts to marginalize the notion  of a color-blind Constitution by consigning it to me and Members of today's plurality.<sup>[19]</sup> See <i>ibid.;</i> see also <i>post,</i> at 61. But I am quite comfortable in the company I keep. My view of the Constitution is Justice Harlan's view in <i>Plessy:</i> \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\" <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 559 (1896) (dissenting opinion). And my view was the rallying cry for the lawyers who litigated <i>Brown.</i> See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellants in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, Nos. 1, 2, and 4 p. 65 (\"That the Constitution is color blind is our dedicated belief\"); Brief for Appellants in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1952, No. 1, p. 5 (\"The Fourteenth Amendment precludes a state from imposing distinctions or classifications based upon race and color alone\");<sup>[20]</sup> see also In Memoriam: Honorable Thurgood Marshall, Proceedings of the Bar and Officers of the Supreme Court of the United States, X (1993) (remarks of Judge Motley) (\"Marshall had a `Bible' to which he turned during his most depressed moments. The `Bible' would be known in the legal community as the first Mr. Justice Harlan's dissent in <i>Plessy </i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 552 (1896). I do not know of any opinion which buoyed Marshall more in his pre-<i>Brown</i> days . . .\").</p>\n<p>The dissent appears to pin its interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause to current societal practice and expectations, deference to local officials, likely practical consequences, and reliance on previous statements from this and other courts. Such a view was ascendant in this Court's jurisprudence for several decades. It first appeared in <i>Plessy,</i> where the Court asked whether a state law providing for segregated railway cars was \"a reasonable regulation.\" 163 U. S., at 550. The Court deferred to local authorities in making its determination, noting that in inquiring into reasonableness \"there must necessarily be a large discretion on the part of the legislature.\" <i>Ibid.</i> The Court likewise paid heed to societal practices, local expectations, and practical consequences by looking to \"the established usages, customs and traditions of the people, and with a view to the promotion of their comfort, and the preservation of the public peace and good order.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Guided by these principles, the Court concluded: \"[W]e cannot say that a law which authorizes or even requires the separation of the two races in public conveyances is unreasonable, or more obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment than the acts of Congress requiring separate schools for colored children in the District of Columbia.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 550-551.</p>\n<p>The segregationists in <i>Brown</i> embraced the arguments the Court endorsed in <i>Plessy.</i> Though <i>Brown</i> decisively rejected those arguments, today's dissent replicates them to a distressing extent. Thus, the dissent argues that \"[e]ach plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation.\" <i>Post,</i> at 47. Similarly, the segregationists made repeated appeals to societal practice and expectation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <i>Briggs</i> v. <i>Elliott</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 2, p. 76 (\"[A] State has power to establish a school system which is capable of efficient administration, taking into account local problems and conditions\").<sup>[21]</sup> The dissent argues that \"weight [must be given] to a local school board's knowledge, expertise, and concerns,\" <i>post,</i> at 48, and with equal vigor, the segregationists argued for deference to local authorities. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Kansas on Reargument in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 1, p. 14 (\"We advocate only a concept of constitutional law that permits determinations of state and local policy to be made on state and local levels. We defend only the validity of the statute that enables the Topeka Board of Education to determine its own course\").<sup>[22]</sup> The dissent argues that today's decision \"threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of race-related litigation,\" <i>post,</i> at 2, and claims that today's decision \"risks serious harm to the law and for the Nation,\" <i>post,</i> at 65. The segregationists also relied upon the likely practical consequences of ending the state-imposed system of racial separation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <i>Davis</i> v. <i>County School Board,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 3, p. 37 (\"Yet a holding that school segregation by race violates the Constitution will result in upheaval in all of those places not now subject to Federal judicial scrutiny. This Court has made many decisions of widespread effect; none would affect more people more directly in more fundamental interests and, in fact, cause more chaos in local government than a reversal of the decision in this case\").<sup>[23]</sup> And foreshadowing today's dissent, the segregationists most heavily relied upon judicial precedent. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Appellees on Reargument in <i>Briggs</i> v. <i>Elliott</i><i>,</i> O. T. 1953, No. 2, p. 59 (\"[I]t would be difficult indeed to find a case so favored by precedent as is the case for South Carolina here\").<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p>The similarities between the dissent's arguments and the segregationists' arguments do not stop there. Like the dissent, the segregationists repeatedly cautioned the Court to consider practicalities and not to embrace too theoretical a view of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup>[25]</sup> And just as the dissent argues that the need for these programs will lessen over time, the segregationists claimed that reliance on segregation was lessening and might eventually end.<sup>[26]</sup></p>\n<p>What was wrong in 1954 cannot be right today.<sup>[27]</sup> Whatever else the Court's rejection of the segregationists' arguments in <i>Brown</i> might have established, it certainly made clear that state and local governments cannot take from the Constitution a right to make decisions on the basis of race by adverse possession. The fact that state and local governments had been discriminating on the basis of race for a long time was irrelevant to the <i>Brown</i> Court. The fact that racial discrimination was preferable to the relevant communities was irrelevant to the <i>Brown</i> Court. And the fact that the state and local governments had relied on statements in this Court's opinions was irrelevant to the <i>Brown</i> Court. The same principles guide today's decision. None of the considerations trumpeted by the dissent is relevant to the constitutionality of the school boards' race-based plans because no contextual detailor collection of contextual details, <i>post,</i> at 2-22-can \"provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\" <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 240 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).<sup>[28]</sup></p>\n<p>In place of the color-blind Constitution, the dissent would permit measures to keep the races together and proscribe measures to keep the races apart.<sup>[29]</sup> See <i>post,</i> at 28-34, 64-65. Although no such distinction is apparent in the Fourteenth Amendment, the dissent would constitutionalize today's faddish social theories that embrace that distinction. The Constitution is not that malleable. Even if current social theories favor classroom racial engineering as necessary to \"solve the problems at hand,\" <i>post,</i> at 21, the Constitution enshrines principles independent of social theories. See <i>Plessy,</i> 163 U. S., at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\"The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is, in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, it will continue to be for all time . . . . But in view of the Constitution, in the eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens.. . . Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens\"). Indeed, if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories.<sup>[30]</sup> See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Dred Scott</i> v. <i>Sandford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"87116\"><a href=\"/opinion/87116/dred-scott-v-sandford/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">How.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span>, 407 (1857) (\"[T]hey [members of the \"negro African race\"] had no rights which the white man was bound to respect\"). Can we really be sure that the racial theories that motivated <i>Dred Scott</i> and <i>Plessy</i> are a relic of the past or that future theories will be nothing But beneficent and progressive? That is a gamble I am unwilling to take, and it is one the Constitution does not allow.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>The plans before us base school assignment decisions on students' race. Because \"[o]ur Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens,\" such race-based decisionmaking is unconstitutional. <i>Plessy, supra,</i> at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting). I concur in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's opinion so holding.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>The Nation's schools strive to teach that our strength comes from people of different races, creeds, and cultures uniting in commitment to the freedom of all. In these cases two school districts in different parts of the country seek to teach that principle by having classrooms that reflect the racial makeup of the surrounding community. That the school districts consider these plans to be necessary should remind us our highest aspirations are yet unfulfilled. But the solutions mandated by these school districts must themselves be lawful. To make race matter now so that it might not matter later may entrench the very prejudices we seek to overcome. In my view the state-mandated racial classifications at issue, official labels proclaiming the race of all persons in a broad class of citizenselementary school students in one case, high school students in anotherare unconstitutional as the cases now come to us.</p>\n<p>I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that we have jurisdiction to decide the cases before us and join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion. I also join Parts IIIA and IIIC for reasons provided below. My views do not allow me to join the balance of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, which seems to me to be inconsistent in both its approach and its implications with the history, meaning, and reach of the Equal Protection Clause. JUSTICE BREYER's dissenting opinion, on the other hand, rests on what in my respectful submission is a misuse and mistaken interpretation of our precedents. This leads it to advance propositions that, in my view, are both erroneous and in fundamental conflict with basic equal protection principles. As a consequence, this separate opinion is necessary to set forth my conclusions in the two cases before the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The opinion of the Court and JUSTICE BREYER's dissenting opinion (hereinafter dissent) describe in detail the history of integration efforts in Louisville and Seattle. These plans classify individuals by race and allocate benefits and burdens on that basis; and as a result, they are to be subjected to strict scrutiny. See <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 505-506 (2005); <i>ante,</i> at 11. The dissent finds that the school districts have identified a compelling interest in increasing diversity, including for the purpose of avoiding racial isolation. See <i>post,</i> at 37-45. The plurality, by contrast, does not acknowledge that the school districts have identified a compelling interest here. See <i>ante,</i> at 17-25. For this reason, among others, I do not join Parts IIIB and IV. Diversity, depending on its meaning and definition, is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue.</p>\n<p>It is well established that when a governmental policy is subjected to strict scrutiny, \"the government has the burden of proving that racial classifications `are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.'\" <i>Johnson, supra,</i> at 505 (quoting <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 227 (1995)). \"Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are `benign' or `remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.\" <i>Richmond</i> v. <i>J. A. Croson Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112176\"><a href=\"/opinion/112176/richmond-v-ja-croson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span>, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion). And the inquiry into less restrictive alternatives demanded by the narrow tailoring analysis requires in many cases a thorough understanding of how a plan works. The government bears the burden of justifying its use of individual racial classifications. As part of that burden it must establish, in detail, how decisions based on an individual student's race are made in a challenged governmental program. The Jefferson County Board of Education fails to meet this threshold mandate.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Crystal Meredith challenges the district's decision to deny her son Joshua McDonald a requested transfer for his kindergarten enrollment. The district concedes it denied his request \"under the guidelines,\" which is to say, on the basis of Joshua's race. Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, p. 10; see also App. in No. 05-915, p. 97. Yet the district also maintains that the guidelines do not apply to \"kindergartens,\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 4, and it fails to explain the discrepancy. Resort to the record, including the parties' Stipulation of Facts, further confuses the matter. See App. in No. 05-915, at 43 (\"Transfer applications can be denied because of lack of available space or, for students in grades other than Primary 1 (kindergarten), the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan\"); <i>id.,</i> at 29 (\"The student assignment plan does not apply to . . . students in Primary 1\"); see also Stipulation of Facts in No. 3:02-CV-00620-JGH; Doc. 32, Exh. 44, p. 6 (2003-04 Jefferson County Public Schools Elementary Student Assignment Application, Section B) (\"Assignment is made to a school for Primary 1 (Kindergarten) through Grade Five as long as racial guidelines are maintained. If the Primary 1 (Kindergarten) placement does not enhance racial balance, a new application must be completed for Primary 2 (Grade One)\").</p>\n<p>The discrepancy identified is not some simple and straightforward error that touches only upon the peripheries of the district's use of individual racial classifications. To the contrary, Jefferson County in its briefing has explained how and when it employs these classifications only in terms so broad and imprecise that they cannot withstand strict scrutiny. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 4-10. While it acknowledges that racial classifications are used to make certain assignment decisions, it fails to make clear, for example, who makes the decisions; what if any oversight is employed; the precise circumstances in which an assignment decision will or will not be made on the basis of race; or how it is determined which of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given race-based decision. See <i>ibid.</i>; see also App. in No. 05-915, at 38, 42 (indicating that decisions are \"based on . . . the racial guidelines\" without further explanation); <i>id.,</i> at 81 (setting forth the blanket mandate that \"[s]chools shall work cooperatively with each other and with central office to ensure that enrollment at all schools [in question] is within the racial guidelines annually and to encourage that the enrollment at all schools progresses toward the midpoint of the guidelines\"); <i>id.,</i> at 43, 76-77, 81-83; <i>McFarland</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Public Schools,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314284\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314284/mcfarland-v-jefferson-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 837-845, 855-862 (WD Ky. 2004).</p>\n<p>When litigation, as here, involves a \"complex, comprehensive plan that contains multiple strategies for achieving racially integrated schools,\" Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 4, these ambiguities become all the more problematic in light of the contradictions and confusions that result. Compare, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-915, at 37 (\"Each [Jefferson County] school . . . has a designated geographic attendance area, which is called the `resides area' of the school[, and each] such school is the `resides school' for those students whose parent's or guardian's residence address is within the school's geographic attendance area\"); <i>id.,</i> at 82 (\"All elementary students . . . shall be assigned to the school which serves the area in which they reside\"); and Brief for Respondents in No. 05-915, at 5 (\"There are no selection criteria for admission to [an elementary school student's] resides school, except attainment of the appropriate age and completion of the previous grade\"), with App. in No. 05-915, at 38 (\"Decisions to assign students to schools within each cluster are based on available space within the [elementary] schools and the racial guidelines in the District's current student assignment plan\"); <i>id.,</i> at 82 (acknowledging that a student may not be assigned to his or her resides school if it \"has reached . . . the extremes of the racial guidelines\").</p>\n<p>One can attempt to identify a construction of Jefferson County's student assignment plan that, at least as a logical matter, complies with these competing propositions; but this does not remedy the underlying problem. Jefferson County fails to make clear to this Courteven in the limited respects implicated by Joshua's initial assignment and transfer denialwhether in fact it relies on racial classifications in a manner narrowly tailored to the interest in question, rather than in the far-reaching, inconsistent, and <i>ad hoc</i> manner that a less forgiving reading of the record would suggest. When a court subjects governmental action to strict scrutiny, it cannot construe ambiguities in favor of the State.</p>\n<p>As for the Seattle case, the school district has gone further in describing the methods and criteria used to determine assignment decisions on the basis of individual racial classifications. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Respondents in No. 05908, p. 5-11. The district, nevertheless, has failed to make an adequate showing in at least one respect. It has failed to explain why, in a district composed of a diversity of races, with fewer than half of the students classified as \"white,\" it has employed the crude racial categories of \"white\" and \"non-white\" as the basis for its assignment decisions. See, <i>e.g., id.,</i> at 1-11.</p>\n<p>The district has identified its purposes as follows: \"(1) to promote the educational benefits of diverse school enrollments; (2) to reduce the potentially harmful effects of racial isolation by allowing students the opportunity to opt out of racially isolated schools; and (3) to make sure that racially segregated housing patterns did not prevent non-white students from having equitable access to the most popular over-subscribed schools.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 19. Yet the school district does not explain how, in the context of its diverse student population, a blunt distinction between \"white\" and \"non-white\" furthers these goals. As the Court explains, \"a school with 50 percent Asian-American students and 50 percent white students but no African-American, Native-American, or Latino students would qualify as balanced, while a school with 30 percent AsianA-merican, 25 percent African-American, 25 percent Latino, and 20 percent white students would not.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 15-16; see also Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> in No. 05-908, pp. 13-14. Far from being narrowly tailored to its purposes, this system threatens to defeat its own ends, and the school district has provided no convincing explanation for its design. Other problems are evident in Seattle's system, but there is no need to address them now. As the district fails to account for the classification system it has chosen, despite what appears to be its ill fit, Seattle has not shown its plan to be narrowly tailored to achieve its own ends; and thus it fails to pass strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>Our Nation from the inception has sought to preserve and expand the promise of liberty and equality on which it was founded. Today we enjoy a society that is remarkable in its openness and opportunity. Yet our tradition is to go beyond present achievements, however significant, and to recognize and confront the flaws and injustices that remain. This is especially true when we seek assurance that opportunity is not denied on account of race. The enduring hope is that race should not matter; the reality is that too often it does.</p>\n<p>This is by way of preface to my respectful submission that parts of the opinion by THE CHIEF JUSTICE imply an all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when, in my view, it may be taken into account. The plurality opinion is too dismissive of the legitimate interest government has in ensuring all people have equal opportunity regardless of their race. The plurality's postulate that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" <i>ante,</i> at 40-41, is not sufficient to decide these cases. Fifty years of experience since <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1954), should teach us that the problem before us defies so easy a solution. School districts can seek to reach <i>Brown</i>'s objective of equal educational opportunity. The plurality opinion is at least open to the interpretation that the Constitution requires school districts to ignore the problem of <i>de facto</i> resegregation in schooling. I cannot endorse that conclusion. To the extent the plurality opinion suggests the Constitution mandates that state and local school authorities must accept the status quo of racial isolation in schools, it is, in my view, profoundly mistaken.</p>\n<p>The statement by Justice Harlan that \"[o]ur Constitution is color-blind\" was most certainly justified in the context of his dissent in <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 559 (1896). The Court's decision in that case was a grievous error it took far too long to overrule. <i>Plessy,</i> of course, concerned official classification by race applicable to all persons who sought to use railway carriages. And, as an aspiration, Justice Harlan's axiom must command our assent. In the real world, it is regrettable to say, it cannot be a universal constitutional principle.</p>\n<p>In the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body, one aspect of which is its racial composition. Cf. <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span> (2003); <i>id.,</i> at 387-388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). If school authorities are concerned that the student-body compositions of certain schools interfere with the objective of offering an equal educational opportunity to all of their students, they are free to devise race-conscious measures to address the problem in a general way and without treating each student in different fashion solely on the basis of a systematic, individual typing by race.</p>\n<p>School boards may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race. These mechanisms are race conscious but do not lead to different treatment based on a classification that tells each student he or she is to be defined by race, so it is unlikely any of them would demand strict scrutiny to be found permissible. See <i>Bush</i> v. <i>Vera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118040\"><a href=\"/opinion/118040/bush-v-vera/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span>, 958 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\"Strict scrutiny does not apply merely because redistricting is performed with consciousness of race. . . . Electoral district lines are `facially race neutral' so a more searching inquiry is necessary before strict scrutiny can be found applicable in redistricting cases than in cases of `classifications based explicitly on race'\" (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 213)). Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races. Assigning to each student a personal designation according to a crude system of individual racial classifications is quite a different matter; and the legal analysis changes accordingly.</p>\n<p>Each respondent has asserted that its assignment of individual students by race is permissible because there is no other way to avoid racial isolation in the school districts. Yet, as explained, each has failed to provide the support necessary for that proposition. Cf. <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 501 (\"The history of racial classifications in this country suggests that blind judicial deference to legislative or executive pronouncements of necessity has no place in equal protection analysis\"). And individual racial classifications employed in this manner may be considered legitimate only if they are a last resort to achieve a compelling interest. See <i>id.,</i> at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>In the cases before us it is noteworthy that the number of students whose assignment depends on express racial classifications is limited. I join Part IIIC of the Court's opinion because I agree that in the context of these plans, the small number of assignments affected suggests that the schools could have achieved their stated ends through different means. These include the facially race-neutral means set forth above or, if necessary, a more nuanced, individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics that might include race as a component. The latter approach would be informed by <i>Grutter,</i> though of course the criteria relevant to student placement would differ based on the age of the students, the needs of the parents, and the role of the schools.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p>The dissent rests on the assumptions that these sweeping race-based classifications of persons are permitted by existing precedents; that its confident endorsement of race categories for each child in a large segment of the community presents no danger to individual freedom in other, prospective realms of governmental regulation; and that the racial classifications used here cause no hurt or anger of the type the Constitution prevents. Each of these premises is, in my respectful view, incorrect.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>The dissent's reliance on this Court's precedents to justify the explicit, sweeping, classwide racial classifications at issue here is a misreading of our authorities that, it appears to me, tends to undermine well-accepted principles needed to guard our freedom. And in his critique of that analysis, I am in many respects in agreement with THE CHIEF JUSTICE. The conclusions he has set forth in Part IIIA of the Court's opinion are correct, in my view, because the compelling interests implicated in the cases before us are distinct from the interests the Court has recognized in remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination and in increasing diversity in higher education. See <i>ante,</i> at 12-13. As the Court notes, we recognized the compelling nature of the interest in remedying past intentional discrimination in <i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 494 (1992), and of the interest in diversity in higher education in <i>Grutter.</i> At the same time, these compelling interests, in my view, do help inform the present inquiry. And to the extent the plurality opinion can be interpreted to foreclose consideration of these interests, I disagree with that reasoning.</p>\n<p>As to the dissent, the general conclusions upon which it relies have no principled limit and would result in the broad acceptance of governmental racial classifications in areas far afield from schooling. The dissent's permissive strict scrutiny (which bears more than a passing resemblance to rational-basis review) could invite widespread governmental deployment of racial classifications. There is every reason to think that, if the dissent's rationale were accepted, Congress, assuming an otherwise proper exercise of its spending authority or commerce power, could mandate either the Seattle or the Jefferson County plans nationwide. There seems to be no principled rule, moreover, to limit the dissent's rationale to the context of public schools. The dissent emphasizes local control, see <i>post,</i> at 48-49, the unique history of school desegregation, see <i>post,</i> at 2, and the fact that these plans make less use of race than prior plans, see <i>post,</i> at 57, but these factors seem more rhetorical than integral to the analytical structure of the opinion.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the dissent's reliance on the Court's opinions in <i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span> (2003), and <i>Grutter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><i>.</i> If today's dissent said it was adhering to the views expressed in the separate opinions in <i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter,</i> see <i>Gratz,</i> 539 U. S., at 281 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 282 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 291 (SOUTER, J., dissenting); <i>id.,</i> at 298 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 344 (GINSBURG, J., concurring), that would be understandable, and likely within the traditionto be invoked, in my view, in rare instancesthat permits us to maintain our own positions in the face of <i>stare decisis</i> when fundamental points of doctrine are at stake. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Federal Maritime Comm'n</i> v. <i>South Carolina Ports Authority,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118511\"><a href=\"/opinion/118511/federal-maritime-commn-v-south-carolina-ports-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span>, 770 (2002) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). To say, however, that we must ratify the racial classifications here at issue based on the majority opinions in <i>Gratz</i> and <i>Grutter</i> is, with all respect, simply baffling.</p>\n<p><i>Gratz</i> involved a system where race was not the entire classification. The procedures in <i>Gratz</i> placed much less reliance on race than do the plans at issue here. The issue in <i>Gratz</i> arose, moreover, in the context of college admissions where students had other choices and precedent supported the proposition that First Amendment interests give universities particular latitude in defining diversity. See <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 312-314 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.). Even so the race factor was found to be invalid. <i>Gratz, supra,</i> at 251. If <i>Gratz</i> is to be the measure, the racial classification systems here are <i>a fortiori</i> invalid. If the dissent were to say that college cases are simply not applicable to public school systems in kindergarten through high school, this would seem to me wrong, but at least an arguable distinction. Under no fair reading, though, can the majority opinion in <i>Gratz</i> be cited as authority to sustain the racial classifications under consideration here.</p>\n<p>The same must be said for the controlling opinion in <i>Grutter.</i> There the Court sustained a system that, it found, was flexible enough to take into account \"all pertinent elements of diversity,\" 539 U. S., at 341 (internal quotation marks omitted), and considered race as only one factor among many, <i>id.,</i> at 340. Seattle's plan, by contrast, relies upon a mechanical formula that has denied hundreds of students their preferred schools on the basis of three rigid criteria: placement of siblings, distance from schools, and race. If those students were considered for a whole range of their talents and school needs with race as just one consideration, <i>Grutter</i> would have some application. That, though, is not the case. The only support today's dissent can draw from <i>Grutter</i> must be found in its various separate opinions, not in the opinion filed for the Court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>To uphold these programs the Court is asked to brush aside two concepts of central importance for determining the validity of laws and decrees designed to alleviate the hurt and adverse consequences resulting from race discrimination. The first is the difference between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation; the second, the presumptive invalidity of a State's use of racial classifications to differentiate its treatment of individuals. In the immediate aftermath of <i>Brown</i> the Court addressed other instances where laws and practices enforced <i>de jure</i> segregation. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1967) (marriage); <i>New Orleans City Park Improvement Assn.</i> v. <i>Detiege,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087792\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087792/new-orleans-city-park-improvement-association-v-detiege/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span> (1958) <i>(per curiam)</i> (public parks); <i>Gayle</i> v. <i>Browder,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">903</span></span> (1956) <i>(per curiam)</i> (buses); <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Atlanta,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">879</span></span> (1955) <i>(per curiam)</i> (golf courses); <i>Mayor of Baltimore</i> v. <i>Dawson,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span> (1955) <i>(per curiam)</i> (beaches). But with reference to schools, the effect of the legal wrong proved most difficult to correct. To remedy the wrong, school districts that had been segregated by law had no choice, whether under court supervision or pursuant to voluntary desegregation efforts, but to resort to extraordinary measures including individual student and teacher assignment to schools based on race. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-10 (1971); see also <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 519 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that racial classifications \"may be the only adequate remedy after a judicial determination that a State or its instrumentality has violated the Equal Protection Clause\"). So it was, as the dissent observes, see <i>post,</i> at 1314, that Louisville classified children by race in its school assignment and busing plan in the 1970's.</p>\n<p>Our cases recognized a fundamental difference between those school districts that had engaged in <i>de jure</i> segregation and those whose segregation was the result of other factors. School districts that had engaged in <i>de jure</i> segregation had an affirmative constitutional duty to desegregate; those that were <i>de facto</i> segregated did not. Compare <i>Green</i> v. <i>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 437-438 (1968), with <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109102\"><a href=\"/opinion/109102/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 745 (1974). The distinctions between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation extended to the remedies available to governmental units in addition to the courts. For example, in <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 274 (1986), the plurality noted: \"This Court never has held that societal discrimination alone is sufficient to justify a racial classification. Rather, the Court has insisted upon some showing of prior discrimination by the governmental unit involved before allowing limited use of racial classifications in order to remedy such discrimination.\" The Court's decision in <i>Croson, supra,</i> reinforced the difference between the remedies available to redress <i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i> discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote>\"To accept [a] claim that past societal discrimination alone can serve as the basis for rigid racial preferences would be to open the door to competing claims for `remedial relief' for every disadvantaged group. The dream of a Nation of equal citizens in a society where race is irrelevant to personal opportunity and achievement would be lost in a mosaic of shifting preferences based on inherently unmeasurable claims of past wrongs.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 505-506.</blockquote>\n<p>From the standpoint of the victim, it is true, an injury stemming from racial prejudice can hurt as much when the demeaning treatment based on race identity stems from bias masked deep within the social order as when it is imposed by law. The distinction between government and private action, furthermore, can be amorphous both as a historical matter and as a matter of present-day finding of fact. Laws arise from a culture and vice versa. Neither can assign to the other all responsibility for persisting injustices.</p>\n<p>Yet, like so many other legal categories that can overlap in some instances, the constitutional distinction between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation has been thought to be an important one. It must be conceded its primary function in school cases was to delimit the powers of the Judiciary in the fashioning of remedies. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Milliken, supra,</i> at 746. The distinction ought not to be altogether disregarded, however, when we come to that most sensitive of all racial issues, an attempt by the government to treat whole classes of persons differently based on the government's systematic classification of each individual by race. There, too, the distinction serves as a limit on the exercise of a power that reaches to the very verge of constitutional authority. Reduction of an individual to an assigned racial identity for differential treatment is among the most pernicious actions our government can undertake. The allocation of governmental burdens and benefits, contentious under any circumstances, is even more divisive when allocations are made on the basis of individual racial classifications. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1978); <i>Adarand,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Notwithstanding these concerns, allocation of benefits and burdens through individual racial classifications was found sometimes permissible in the context of remedies for <i>de jure</i> wrong. Where there has been <i>de jure</i> segregation, there is a cognizable legal wrong, and the courts and legislatures have broad power to remedy it. The remedy, though, was limited in time and limited to the wrong. The Court has allowed school districts to remedy their prior <i>de jure</i> segregation by classifying individual students based on their race. See <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Swann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108319\"><a href=\"/opinion/108319/north-carolina-bd-of-ed-v-swann/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 45-46 (1971). The limitation of this power to instances where there has been <i>de jure</i> segregation serves to confine the nature, extent, and duration of governmental reliance on individual racial classifications.</p>\n<p>The cases here were argued upon the assumption, and come to us on the premise, that the discrimination in question did not result from <i>de jure</i> actions. And when <i>de facto</i> discrimination is at issue our tradition has been that the remedial rules are different. The State must seek alternatives to the classification and differential treatment of individuals by race, at least absent some extraordinary howing not present here.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The dissent refers to an opinion filed by Judge Kozinski in one of the cases now before us, and that opinion relied upon an opinion filed by Chief Judge Boudin in a case presenting an issue similar to the one here. See <i>post,</i> at 35 (citing <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792253\"><a href=\"/opinion/792253/parents-involved-in-community-schools-a-washington-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1193-1196 (CA9 2005) (concurring opinion) (citing <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 27-29 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring))). Though this may oversimplify the matter a bit, one of the main concerns underlying those opinions was this: If it is legitimate for school authorities to work to avoid racial isolation in their schools, must they do so only by indirection and general policies? Does the Constitution mandate this inefficient result? Why may the authorities not recognize the problem in candid fashion and solve it altogether through resort to direct assignments based on student racial classifications? So, the argument proceeds, if race is the problem, then perhaps race is the solution.</p>\n<p>The argument ignores the dangers presented by individual classifications, dangers that are not as pressing when the same ends are achieved by more indirect means. When the government classifies an individual by race, it must first define what it means to be of a race. Who exactly is white and who is nonwhite? To be forced to live under a state-mandated racial label is inconsistent with the dignity of individuals in our society. And it is a label that an individual is powerless to change. Governmental classifications that command people to march in different directions based on racial typologies can cause a new divisiveness. The practice can lead to corrosive discourse, where race serves not as an element of our diverse heritage but instead as a bargaining chip in the political process. On the other hand race-conscious measures that do not rely on differential treatment based on individual classifications present these problems to a lesser degree.</p>\n<p>The idea that if race is the problem, race is the instrument with which to solve it cannot be accepted as an analytical leap forward. And if this is a frustrating duality of the Equal Protection Clause it simply reflects the duality of our history and our attempts to promote freedom in a world that sometimes seems set against it. Under our Constitution the individual, child or adult, can find his own identity, can define her own persona, without state intervention that classifies on the basis of his race or the color of her skin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children. A compelling interest exists in avoiding racial isolation, an interest that a school district, in its discretion and expertise, may choose to pursue. Likewise, a district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population. Race may be one component of that diversity, but other demographic factors, plus special talents and needs, should also be considered. What the government is not permitted to do, absent a showing of necessity not made here, is to classify every student on the basis of race and to assign each of them to schools based on that classification. Crude measures of this sort threaten to reduce children to racial chits valued and traded according to one school's supply and another's demand.</p>\n<p>That statement, to be sure, invites this response: A sense of stigma may already become the fate of those separated out by circumstances beyond their immediate control. But to this the replication must be: Even so, measures other than differential treatment based on racial typing of individuals first must be exhausted.</p>\n<p>The decision today should not prevent school districts from continuing the important work of bringing together students of different racial, ethnic, and economic back-grounds. Due to a variety of factorssome influenced by government, some notneighborhoods in our communities do not reflect the diversity of our Nation as a whole. Those entrusted with directing our public schools can bring to bear the creativity of experts, parents, administrators, and other concerned citizens to find a way to achieve the compelling interests they face without resorting to widespread governmental allocation of benefits and burdens on the basis of racial classifications.</p>\n<p>With this explanation I concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.</p>\n<p>While I join JUSTICE BREYER's eloquent and unanswerable dissent in its entirety, it is appropriate to add these words.</p>\n<p>There is a cruel irony in THE CHIEF JUSTICE's reliance on our decision in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105312\"><a href=\"/opinion/105312/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span> (1955). The first sentence in the concluding paragraph of his opinion states: \"Before <i>Brown,</i> schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 40. This sentence reminds me of Anatole France's observation: \"[T]he majestic equality of the la[w], forbid[s] rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal their bread.\"<sup>[1]</sup> THE CHIEF JUSTICE fails to note that it was only black schoolchildren who were so ordered; indeed, the history books do not tell stories of white children struggling to attend black schools.<sup>[2]</sup> In this and other ways, THE CHIEF JUSTICE rewrites the history of one of this Court's most important decisions. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 39 (\"history will be heard\"), with <i>Brewer</i> v. <i>Quarterman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145741\"><a href=\"/opinion/145741/brewer-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></a></span>___, ___ (2007) (slip op., at 11) (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting) (\"It is a familiar adage that history is written by the victors\").</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE rejects the conclusion that the racial classifications at issue here should be viewed differently than others, because they do not impose burdens on one race alone and do not stigmatize or exclude.<sup>[3]</sup> The only justification for refusing to acknowledge the obvious importance of that difference is the citation of a few recent opinionsnone of which even approached unanimity grandly proclaiming that all racial classifications must be analyzed under \"strict scrutiny.\" See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 227 (1995). Even today, two of our wisest federal judges have rejected such a wooden reading of the Equal Protection Clause in the context of school integration.

The school board plans before us resemble many others adopted in the last 50 years by primary and secondary schools throughout the Nation. All of those plans represent local efforts to bring about the kind of racially integrated education that <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1954), long ago promisedefforts that this Court has repeatedly required, permitted, and encouraged local authorities to undertake. This Court has recognized that the public interests at stake in such cases are \"compelling.\" We have approved of \"narrowly tailored\" plans that are no less race-conscious than the plans before us. And we have understood that the Constitution <i>permits</i> local communities to adopt desegregation plans even where it does not <i>require</i> them to do so.</p>\n<p>The plurality pays inadequate attention to this law, to past opinions' rationales, their language, and the contexts in which they arise. As a result, it reverses course and reaches the wrong conclusion. In doing so, it distorts precedent, it misapplies the relevant constitutional principles, it announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools, it threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of racerelated litigation, and it undermines <i>Brown</i>'s promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality. This cannot be justified in the name of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Facts</i></h2>\n<p>The historical and factual context in which these cases arise is critical. In <i>Brown,</i> this Court held that the government's segregation of schoolchildren by race violates the Constitution's promise of equal protection. The Court emphasized that \"education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments.\" 347 U. S., at 493. And it thereby set the Nation on a path toward public school integration.</p>\n<p>In dozens of subsequent cases, this Court told school districts previously segregated by law what they must do at a minimum to comply with <i>Brown</i>'s constitutional holding. The measures required by those cases often included race-conscious practices, such as mandatory busing and race-based restrictions on voluntary transfers. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Columbus Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Penick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110141\"><a href=\"/opinion/110141/columbus-bd-of-ed-v-penick/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 455, n. 3 (1979); <i>Davis</i> v. <i>Board of School Comm'rs of Mobile Cty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108317\"><a href=\"/opinion/108317/davis-v-board-of-school-commrs-of-mobile-cty/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 37-38 (1971); <i>Green</i> v. <i>School Bd. of New Kent Cty.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 441-442 (1968).</p>\n<p>Beyond those minimum requirements, the Court left much of the determination of how to achieve integration to the judgment of local communities. Thus, in respect to race-conscious desegregation measures that the Constitution <i>permitted,</i> but did not <i>require</i> (measures similar to those at issue here), this Court unanimously stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. <i>To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.</i>\" <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1971) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, different districtssome acting under court decree, some acting in order to avoid threatened lawsuits, some seeking to comply with federal administrative orders, some acting purely voluntarily, some acting after federal courts had dissolved earlier ordersadopted, modified, and experimented with hosts of different kinds of plans, including race-conscious plans, all with a similar objective: greater racial integration of public schools. See F. Welch &amp; A. Light, New Evidence on School Desegregation v (1987) (hereinafter Welch) (prepared for the Commission on Civil Rights) (reviewing a sample of 125 school districts, constituting 20% of national public school enrollment, that had experimented with nearly 300 different plans over 18 years). The techniques that different districts have employed range \"from voluntary transfer programs to mandatory reassignment.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 21. And the design of particular plans has been \"dictated by both the law and the specific needs of the district.\" <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Overall these efforts brought about considerable racial integration. More recently, however, progress has stalled. Between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending a school where minority children constituted more than half of the school fell from 77% to 63% in the Nation (from 81% to 57% in the South) but then reversed direction by the year 2000, rising from 63% to 72% in the Nation (from 57% to 69% in the South). Similarly, between 1968 and 1980, the number of black children attending schools that were more than 90% minority fell from 64% to 33% in the Nation (from 78% to 23% in the South), but that too reversed direction, rising by the year 2000 from 33% to 37% in the Nation (from 23% to 31% in the South). As of 2002, almost 2.4 million students, or over 5% of all public school enrollment, attended schools with a white population of less than 1%. Of these, 2.3 million were black and Latino students, and only 72,000 were white. Today, more than one in six black children attend a school that is 99-100% minority. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> In light of the evident risk of a return to school systems that are in fact (though not in law) resegregated, many school districts have felt a need to maintain or to extend their integration efforts.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that myriad school districts operating in myriad circumstances have devised myriad plans, often with race-conscious elements, all for the sake of eradicating earlier school segregation, bringing about integration, or preventing retrogression. Seattle and Louisville are two such districts, and the histories of their present plans set forth typical school integration stories.</p>\n<p>I describe those histories at length in order to highlight three important features of these cases. First, the school districts' plans serve \"compelling interests\" and are \"narrowly tailored\" on any reasonable definition of those terms. Second, the distinction between <i>de jure</i> segregation (caused by school systems) and <i>de facto</i> segregation (caused, <i>e.g.,</i> by housing patterns or generalized societal discrimination) is meaningless in the present context, thereby dooming the plurality's endeavor to find support for its views in that distinction. Third, real-world efforts to substitute racially diverse for racially segregated schools (however caused) are complex, to the point where the Constitution cannot plausibly be interpreted to rule out categorically all local efforts to use means that are \"conscious\" of the race of individuals.</p>\n<p>In both Seattle and Louisville, the local school districts began with schools that were highly segregated in fact. In both cities plaintiffs filed lawsuits claiming unconstitutional segregation. In Louisville, a federal district court found that school segregation reflected pre-<i>Brown</i> state laws separating the races. In Seattle, the plaintiffs alleged that school segregation unconstitutionally reflected not only generalized societal discrimination and residential housing patterns, but also <i>school board policies and actions</i> that had helped to create, maintain, and aggravate racial segregation. In Louisville, a federal court entered a remedial decree. In Seattle, the parties settled after the school district pledged to undertake a desegregation plan. In both cities, the school boards adopted plans designed to achieve integration by bringing about more racially diverse schools. In each city the school board modified its plan several times in light of, for example, hostility to busing, the threat of resegregation, and the desirability of introducing greater student choice. And in each city, the school boards' plans have evolved over time in ways that progressively <i>diminish</i> the plans' use of explicit race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>The histories that follow set forth these basic facts. They are based upon numerous sources, which for ease of exposition I have cataloged, along with their corresponding citations, at Appendix B, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Seattle</i></h2>\n<p><i>1. Segregation, 1945 to 1956.</i> During and just after World War II, significant numbers of black Americans began to make Seattle their home. Few black residents lived outside the central section of the city. Most worked at unskilled jobs. Although black students made up about 3% of the total Seattle population in the mid-1950's, nearly all black children attended schools where a majority of the population was minority. Elementary schools in central Seattle were between 60% and 80% black; Garfield, the central district high school, was more than 50% minority; schools outside the central and southeastern sections of Seattle were virtually all white.</p>\n<p><i>2. Preliminary Challenges, 1956 to 1969.</i> In 1956, a memo for the Seattle School Board reported that school segregation reflected not only segregated housing patterns but also school board policies that permitted white students to transfer out of black schools while restricting the transfer of black students into white schools. In 1958, black parents whose children attended Harrison Elementary School (with a black student population of over 75%) wrote the Seattle board, complaining that the \"`boundaries for the Harrison Elementary School were not set in accordance with the long-established standards of the School District . . . but were arbitrarily set with an end to excluding colored children from McGilvra School, which is adjacent to the Harrison school district.' \"</p>\n<p>In 1963, at the insistence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other community groups, the school board adopted a new racebased transfer policy. The new policy added an explicitly racial criterion: If a place exists in a school, then, irrespective of other transfer criteria, a white student may transfer to a predominantly black school, and a black student may transfer to a predominantly white school.</p>\n<p>At that time one high school, Garfield, was about two-thirds minority; eight high schools were virtually all white. In 1963, the transfer program's first year, 239 black students and 8 white students transferred. In 1969, about 2,200 (of 10,383 total) of the district's black students and about 400 of the district's white students took advantage of the plan. For the next decade, annual program transfers remained at approximately this level.</p>\n<p><i>3. The NAACP's First Legal Challenge and Seattle's Response, 1969 to 1977.</i> In 1969 the NAACP filed a federal lawsuit against the school board, claiming that the board had \"unlawfully and unconstitutionally\" \"establish[ed]\" and \"maintain[ed]\" a system of \"racially segregated public schools.\" The complaint said that 77% of black public elementary school students in Seattle attended 9 of the city's 86 elementary schools and that 23 of the remaining schools had no black students at all. Similarly, of the 1,461 black students enrolled in the 12 senior high schools in Seattle, 1,151 (or 78.8%) attended 3 senior high schools, and 900 (61.6%) attended a single school, Garfield.</p>\n<p>The complaint charged that the school board had brought about this segregated system in part by \"mak[ing] and enforc[ing]\" certain \"rules and regulations,\" in part by \"drawing . . . boundary lines\" and \"executing school attendance policies\" that would create and maintain \"predominantly Negro or non-white schools,\" and in part by building schools \"in such a manner as to restrict the Negro plaintiffs and the class they represent to predominantly negro or non-white schools.\" The complaint also charged that the board discriminated in assigning teachers.</p>\n<p>The board responded to the lawsuit by introducing a plan that required race-based transfers and mandatory busing. The plan created three new middle schools at three school buildings in the predominantly white north end. It then created a \"mixed\" student body by assigning to those schools students who would otherwise attend predominantly white, or predominantly black, schools elsewhere. It used explicitly racial criteria in making these assignments (<i>i.e.,</i> it deliberately assigned to the new middle schools black students, not white students, from the black schools and white students, not black students, from the white schools). And it used busing to transport the students to their new assignments. The plan provoked considerable local opposition. Opponents brought a lawsuit. But eventually a state court found that the mandatory busing was lawful.</p>\n<p>In 1976-1977, the plan involved the busing of about 500 middle school students (300 black students and 200 white students). Another 1,200 black students and 400 white students participated in the previously adopted voluntary transfer program. Thus about 2,000 students out of a total district population of about 60,000 students were involved in one or the other transfer program. At that time, about 20% or 12,000 of the district's students were black. And the board continued to describe 26 of its 112 schools as \"segregated.\"</p>\n<p><i>4. The NAACP's Second Legal Challenge, 1977.</i> In 1977, the NAACP filed another legal complaint, this time with the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). The complaint alleged that the Seattle School Board had created or perpetuated unlawful racial segregation through, <i>e.g.,</i> certain school-transfer criteria, a construction program that need-lessly built new schools in white areas, district line-drawing criteria, the maintenance of inferior facilities at black schools, the use of explicit racial criteria in the assignment of teachers and other staff, and a general pattern of delay in respect to the implementation of promised desegregation efforts.</p>\n<p>The OCR and the school board entered into a formal settlement agreement. The agreement required the board to implement what became known as the \"Seattle Plan.\"</p>\n<p><i>5. The Seattle Plan: Mandatory Busing, 1978 to 1988.</i> The board began to implement the Seattle Plan in 1978. This plan labeled \"racially imbalanced\" any school at which the percentage of black students exceeded by more than 20% the minority population of the school district as a whole. It applied that label to 26 schools, including 4 high schoolsCleveland (72.8% minority), Franklin (76.6% minority), Garfield (78.4% minority), and Rainier Beach (58.9% minority). The plan paired (or \"triaded\") \"imbalanced\" black schools with \"imbalanced\" white schools. It then placed some grades (say, third and fourth grades) at one school building and other grades (say, fifth and sixth grades) at the other school building. And it thereby required, for example, all fourth grade students from the previously black and previously white schools first to attend together what would now be a \"mixed\" fourth grade at one of the school buildings and then the next year to attend what would now be a \"mixed\" fifth grade at the other school building.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the plan provided that a previous \"black\" school would remain about 50% black, while a previous \"white\" school would remain about two-thirds white. It was consequently necessary to decide with some care <i>which</i> students would attend the new \"mixed\" grade. For this purpose, administrators cataloged the racial makeup of each neighborhood housing block. The school district met its percentage goals by assigning to the new \"mixed\" school an appropriate number of \"black\" housing blocks and \"white\" housing blocks. At the same time, transport from house to school involved extensive busing, with about half of all students attending a school other than the one closest to their home.</p>\n<p>The Seattle Plan achieved the school integration that it sought. Just prior to the plan's implementation, for example, 4 of Seattle's 11 high schools were \"imbalanced,\" <i>i.e.,</i> almost exclusively \"black\" or almost exclusively \"white.\" By 1979, only two were out of \"balance.\" By 1980 only Cleveland remained out of \"balance\" (as the board defined it) and that by a mere two students.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the Seattle Plan, due to its busing, provoked serious opposition within the State. See generally <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 461466 (1982). Thus, Washington state voters enacted an initiative that amended state law to require students to be assigned to the schools closest to their homes. <i>Id.,</i> at 462. The Seattle School Board challenged the constitutionality of the initiative. <i>Id.,</i> at 464. This Court then held that the initiativewhich would have prevented the Seattle Plan from taking effectviolated the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Id.,</i> at 470.</p>\n<p><i>6. Student Choice, 1988 to 1998.</i> By 1988, many white families had left the school district, and many Asian families had moved in. The public school population had fallen from about 100,000 to less than 50,000. The racial makeup of the school population amounted to 43% white, 24% black, and 23% Asian or Pacific Islander, with Hispanics and Native Americans making up the rest. The cost of busing, the harm that members of all racial communities feared that the Seattle Plan caused, the desire to attract white families back to the public schools, and the interest in providing greater school choice led the board to abandon busing and to substitute a new student assignment policy that resembles the plan now before us.</p>\n<p>The new plan permitted each student to choose the school he or she wished to attend, subject to race-based constraints. In respect to high schools, for example, a student was given a list of a subset of schools, carefully selected by the board to balance racial distribution in the district by including neighborhood schools and schools in racially different neighborhoods elsewhere in the city. The student could then choose among those schools, indicating a first choice, and other choices the student found acceptable. In making an assignment to a particular high school, the district would give first preference to a student with a sibling already at the school. It gave second preference to a student whose race differed from a race that was \"over-represented\" at the school (<i>i.e.,</i> a race that accounted for a higher percentage of the school population than of the total district population). It gave third preference to students residing in the neighborhood. It gave fourth preference to students who received child care in the neighborhood. In a typical year, say, 1995, about 20,000 potential high school students participated. About 68% received their first choice. Another 16% received an \"acceptable\" choice. A further 16% were assigned to a school they had not listed.</p>\n<p><i>7. The Current Plan, 1999 to the Present.</i> In 1996, the school board adopted the present plan, which began in 1999. In doing so, it sought to deemphasize the use of racial criteria and to increase the likelihood that a student would receive an assignment at his first or second choice high school. The district retained a racial tiebreaker for oversubscribed schools, which takes effect only if the school's minority or majority enrollment falls outside of a 30% range centered on the minority/majority population ratio within the district. At the same time, all students were free subsequently to transfer from the school at which they were initially placed to a different school of their choice without regard to race. Thus, at worst, a student would have to spend one year at a high school he did not pick as a first or second choice.</p>\n<p>The new plan worked roughly as expected for the two school years during which it was in effect (1999-2000 and 2000-2001). In the 2000-2001 school year, for example, with the racial tiebreaker, the entering ninth grade class at Franklin High School had a 60% minority population; without the racial tiebreaker that same class at Franklin would have had an almost 80% minority population. (We consider only the ninth grade since only students entering that class were subject to the tiebreaker, and because the plan was not in place long enough to change the composition of an entire school.) In the year 2005-2006, by which time the racial tiebreaker had not been used for several years, Franklin's overall minority enrollment had risen to 90%. During the period the tiebreaker applied, it typically affected about 300 students per year. Between 80% and 90% of all students received their first choice assignment; between 89% and 97% received their first or second choice assignment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Parents Involved in Community Schools objected to Seattle's most recent plan under the State and Federal Constitutions. In due course, the Washington Supreme Court, the Federal District Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (sitting en banc) rejected the challenge and found Seattle's plan lawful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Louisville</i></h2>\n<p><i>1. Before the Lawsuit, 1954 to 1972.</i> In 1956, two years after <i>Brown</i> made clear that Kentucky could no longer require racial segregation by law, the Louisville Board of Education created a geography-based student assignment plan designed to help achieve school integration. At the same time it adopted an open transfer policy under which approximately 3,000 of Louisville's 46,000 students applied for transfer. By 1972, however, the Louisville School District remained highly segregated. Approximately half the district's public school enrollment was black; about half was white. Fourteen of the district's nineteen nonvocational middle and high schools were close to totally black or totally white. Nineteen of the district's forty-six elementary schools were between 80% and 100% black. Twenty-one elementary schools were between roughly 90% and 100% white.</p>\n<p><i>2. Court-Imposed Guidelines and Busing, 1972 to 1991.</i> In 1972, civil rights groups and parents, claiming unconstitutional segregation, sued the Louisville Board of Education in federal court. The original litigation eventually became a lawsuit against the Jefferson County School System, which in April 1975 absorbed Louisville's schools and combined them with those of the surrounding suburbs. (For ease of exposition, I shall still use \"Louisville\" to refer to what is now the combined districts.) After preliminary rulings and an eventual victory for the plaintiffs in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the District Court in July 1975 entered an order requiring desegregation.</p>\n<p>The order's requirements reflected a (newly enlarged) school district student population of about 135,000, approximately 20% of whom were black. The order required the school board to create and to maintain schools with student populations that ranged, for elementary schools, between 12% and 40% black, and for secondary schools (with one exception), between 12.5% and 35% black.</p>\n<p>The District Court also adopted a complex desegregation plan designed to achieve the order's targets. The plan required redrawing school attendance zones, closing 12 schools, and busing groups of students, selected by race and the first letter of their last names, to schools outside their immediate neighborhoods. The plan's initial busing requirements were extensive, involving the busing of 23,000 students and a transportation fleet that had to \"operate from early in the morning until late in the evening.\" For typical students, the plan meant busing for several years (several more years for typical black students than for typical white students). The following notice, published in a Louisville newspaper in 1976, gives a sense of how the district's race-based busing plan operated in practice:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Louisville Courier Journal, June 18, 1976 (reproduced in J. Wilkinson, From <i>Brown</i> to <i>Bakke:</i> The Supreme Court and School Integration 1954-1978, p. 176 (1979)).</p>\n<p>The District Court monitored implementation of the plan. In 1978, it found that the plan had brought all of Louisville's schools within its \"`guidelines' for racial composition\" for \"at least a substantial portion of the [previous] three years.\" It removed the case from its active docket while stating that it expected the board \"to continue to implement those portions of the desegregation order which are by their nature of a continuing effect.\"</p>\n<p>By 1984, after several schools had fallen out of compliance with the order's racial percentages due to shifting demographics in the community, the school board revised its desegregation plan. In doing so, the board created a new racial \"guideline,\" namely a \"floating range of 10% above and 10% below the countywide average for the different grade levels.\" The board simultaneously redrew district boundaries so that middle school students could attend the same school for three years and high school students for four years. It added \"magnet\" programs at two high schools. And it adjusted its alphabet-based system for grouping and busing students. The board estimated that its new plan would lead to annual reassignment (with busing) of about 8,500 black students and about 8,000 white students.</p>\n<p><i>3. Student Choice and Project Renaissance, 1991 to 1996.</i> By 1991, the board had concluded that assigning elementary school students to two or more schools during their elementary school years had proved educationally unsound and, if continued, would undermine Kentucky's newly adopted Education Reform Act. It consequently conducted a nearly year-long review of its plan. In doing so, it consulted widely with parents and other members of the local community, using public presentations, public meetings, and various other methods to obtain the public's input. At the conclusion of this review, the board adopted a new plan, called \"Project Renaissance,\" that emphasized student choice.</p>\n<p>Project Renaissance again revised the board's racial guidelines. It provided that each elementary school would have a black student population of between 15% and 50%; each middle and high school would have a black population and a white population that fell within a range, the boundaries of which were set at 15% above and 15% below the general student population percentages in the county at that grade level. The plan then drew new geographical school assignment zones designed to satisfy these guide-lines; the district could reassign students if particular schools failed to meet the guidelines and was required to do so if a school repeatedly missed these targets.</p>\n<p>In respect to elementary schools, the plan first drew a neighborhood line around each elementary school, and it then drew a second line around groups of elementary schools (called \"clusters\"). It initially assigned each student to his or her neighborhood school, but it permitted each student freely to transfer between elementary schools within each cluster <i>provided that</i> the transferring student (a) was black if transferring from a predominantly black school to a predominantly white school, or (b) was white if transferring from a predominantly white school to a predominantly black school. Students could also apply to attend magnet elementary schools or programs.</p>\n<p>The plan required each middle school student to be assigned to his or her neighborhood school unless the student applied for, and was accepted by, a magnet middle school. The plan provided for \"open\" high school enrollment. Every 9th or 10th grader could apply to any high school in the system, and the high school would accept applicants according to set criteriaone of which consisted of the need to attain or remain in compliance with the plan's racial guidelines. Finally, the plan created two new magnet schools, one each at the elementary and middle school levels.</p>\n<p><i>4. The Current Plan: Project Renaissance Modified, 1996 to 2003.</i> In 1995 and 1996, the Louisville School Board, with the help of a special \"Planning Team,\" community meetings, and other official and unofficial study groups, monitored the effects of Project Renaissance and considered proposals for improvement. Consequently, in 1996, the board modified Project Renaissance, thereby creating the present plan.</p>\n<p>At the time, the district's public school population was approximately 30% black. The plan consequently redrew the racial \"guidelines,\" setting the boundaries at 15% to 50% black for <i>all</i> schools. It again redrew school assignment boundaries. And it expanded the transfer opportunities available to elementary and middle school pupils. The plan forbade transfers, however, if the transfer would lead to a school population outside the guideline range, <i>i.e.,</i> if it would create a school where fewer than 15% or more than 50% of the students were black.</p>\n<p>The plan also established \"Parent Assistance Centers\" to help parents and students navigate the school selection and assignment process. It pledged the use of other resources in order to \"encourage all schools to achieve an African-American enrollment equivalent to the average district-wide African-American enrollment at the school's respective elementary, middle or high school level.\" And the plan continued use of magnet schools.</p>\n<p>In 1999, several parents brought a lawsuit in federal court attacking the plan's use of racial guidelines at one of the district's magnet schools. They asked the court to dissolve the desegregation order and to hold the use of <i>magnet</i> school racial guidelines unconstitutional. The board opposed dissolution, arguing that \"the old dual system\" had left a \"demographic imbalance\" that \"prevent[ed] dissolution.\" In 2000, after reviewing the present plan, the District Court dissolved the 1975 order. It wrote that there was \"overwhelming evidence of the Board's good faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes.\" It added that the Louisville School Board had \"treated the ideal of an integrated system as much more than a legal obligationthey consider it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded public school education.\"</p>\n<p>The Court also found that the magnet programs available at the high school in question were \"not available at other high schools\" in the school district. It consequently held unconstitutional the use of race-based \"targets\" to govern admission to <i>magnet schools.</i> And it ordered the board not to control access to those scarce programs through the use of racial targets.</p>\n<p><i>5. The Current Lawsuit, 2003 to the Present.</i> Subsequent to the District Court's dissolution of the desegregation order (in 2000) the board simply continued to implement its 1996 plan as modified to reflect the court's magnet school determination. In 2003, the petitioner now before us, Crystal Meredith, brought this lawsuit challenging the plan's unmodified portions, <i>i.e.,</i> those portions that dealt with <i>ordinary,</i> not magnet, schools. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejected Meredith's challenge and held the unmodified aspects of the plan constitutional.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>The histories I have set forth describe the extensive and ongoing efforts of two school districts to bring about greater racial integration of their public schools. In both cases the efforts were in part remedial. Louisville began its integration efforts in earnest when a federal court in 1975 entered a school desegregation order. Seattle undertook its integration efforts in response to the filing of a federal lawsuit and as a result of its settlement of a segregation complaint filed with the federal OCR. The plans in both Louisville and Seattle grow out of these earlier remedial efforts. Both districts faced problems that reflected initial periods of severe racial segregation, followed by such remedial efforts as busing, followed by evidence of resegregation, followed by a need to end busing and encourage the return of, <i>e.g.,</i> suburban students through increased student choice. When formulating the plans under review, both districts drew upon their considerable experience with earlier plans, having revised their policies periodically in light of that experience. Both districts rethought their methods over time and explored a wide range of other means, including non-race-conscious policies. Both districts also considered elaborate studies and consulted widely within their communities.</p>\n<p>Both districts sought greater racial integration for educational and democratic, as well as for remedial, reasons. Both sought to achieve these objectives while preserving their commitment to other educational goals, <i>e.g.,</i> districtwide commitment to high quality public schools, increased pupil assignment to neighborhood schools, diminished use of busing, greater student choice, reduced risk of white flight, and so forth. Consequently, the present plans expand student choice; they limit the burdens (including busing) that earlier plans had imposed upon students and their families; and they use race-conscious criteria in limited and gradually diminishing ways. In particular, they use race-conscious criteria only to mark the outer bounds of broad population-related ranges.</p>\n<p>The histories also make clear the futility of looking simply to whether earlier school segregation was <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i> in order to draw firm lines separating the constitutionally permissible from the constitutionally forbidden use of \"race-conscious\" criteria. JUSTICE THOMAS suggests that it will be easy to identify <i>de jure</i> segregation because \"[i]n most cases, there either will or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the races.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 6, n. 4 (concurring opinion). But our precedent has recognized that <i>de jure</i> discrimination can be present even in the absence of racially explicit laws. See <i>Yick Wo</i> v. <i>Hopkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, 373-374 (1886).</p>\n<p>No one here disputes that Louisville's segregation was <i>de jure.</i> But what about Seattle's? Was it <i>de facto? De jure?</i> A mixture? Opinions differed. Or is it that a prior federal court had not adjudicated the matter? Does that make a difference? Is Seattle free on remand to say that its schools were <i>de jure</i> segregated, just as in 1956 a memo for the School Board admitted? The plurality does not seem confident as to the answer. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 12 (opinion of the Court) (\"[T]he Seattle public schools <i>have never shown</i> that they were ever segregated by law\" (emphasis added)), with <i>ante</i> at 29-30 (plurality opinion) (assuming \"the Seattle school district was never segregated by law,\" but seeming to concede that a school district with <i>de jure</i> segregation need not be subject to a court order to be allowed to engage in race-based remedial measures).</p>\n<p>A court finding of <i>de jure</i> segregation cannot be the crucial variable. After all, a number of school districts in the South that the Government or private plaintiffs challenged as segregated <i>by law</i> voluntarily desegregated their schools <i>without a court order</i>just as Seattle did. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Coleman, Desegregation of the Public Schools in KentuckyThe Second Year After the Supreme Court's Decision, 25 J. Negro Educ. 254, 256, 261 (1956) (40 of Kentucky's 180 school districts began desegregation without court orders); Branton, Little Rock Revisited: Desegregation to Resegregation, 52 J. Negro Educ. 250, 251 (1983) (similar in Arkansas); Bullock &amp; Rodgers, Coercion to Compliance: Southern School Districts and School Desegregation Guidelines, 38 J. Politics 987, 991 (1976) (similar in Georgia); <i>McDaniel</i> v. <i>Barresi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108318\"><a href=\"/opinion/108318/mcdaniel-v-barresi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span>, 40, n. 1 (1971) (Clarke County, Georgia). See also Letter from Robert F. Kennedy, Attorney General, to John F. Kennedy, President (Jan. 24, 1963) (hereinafter Kennedy Report), available at http://www.gilderlehrman.org/search/collection_pdfs/05/63/ 0/05630.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court's case file) (reporting successful efforts by the Government to induce voluntary desegregation).</p>\n<p>Moreover, Louisville's history makes clear that a community under a court order to desegregate might submit a race-conscious remedial plan <i>before</i> the court dissolved the order, but with every intention of following that plan even <i>after</i> dissolution. How could such a plan be lawful the day before dissolution but then become unlawful the very next day? On what legal ground can the majority rest its contrary view? But see <i>ante,</i> at 12-13, 17, n. 12.</p>\n<p>Are courts really to treat as merely <i>de facto</i> segregated those school districts that avoided a federal order by voluntarily complying with <i>Brown</i>'s requirements? See <i>id.,</i> at 12, 29-30. This Court has previously done just the opposite, permitting a race-conscious remedy without any kind of court decree. See <i>McDaniel, supra,</i> at 41. Because the Constitution emphatically does not forbid the use of race-conscious measures by districts in the South that voluntarily desegregated their schools, on what basis does the plurality claim that the law forbids Seattle to do the same? But see <i>ante,</i> at 29.</p>\n<p>The histories also indicate the complexity of the tasks and the practical difficulties that local school boards face when they seek to achieve greater racial integration. The boards work in communities where demographic patterns change, where they must meet traditional learning goals, where they must attract and retain effective teachers, where they should (and will) take account of parents' views and maintain <i>their</i> commitment to public school education, where they must adapt to court intervention, where they must encourage voluntary student and parent actionwhere they will find that their own good faith, their knowledge, and their understanding of local circumstances are always necessary but often insufficient to solve the problems at hand.</p>\n<p>These facts and circumstances help explain why in this context, as to means, the law often leaves legislatures, city councils, school boards, and voters with a broad range of choice, thereby giving \"different communities\" the opportunity to \"try different solutions to common problems and gravitate toward those that prove most successful or seem to them best to suit their individual needs.\" <i>Comfort</i> v. <i>Lynn School Comm.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 28 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C.

Because of its importance, I shall repeat what this Court said about the matter in <i>Swann.</i> Chief Justice Burger, on behalf of a unanimous Court in a case of exceptional importance, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\"School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude, for example, that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole. To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities.\" 402 U. S., at 16.</blockquote>\n<p>The statement was not a technical holding in the case. But the Court set forth in <i>Swann</i> a basic principle of constitutional lawa principle of law that has found \"wide acceptance in the legal culture.\" <i>Dickerson</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118380\"><a href=\"/opinion/118380/dickerson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span>, 443 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>Mitchell</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118278\"><a href=\"/opinion/118278/mitchell-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 330 (1999); <i>id.,</i> at 331, 332 (SCALIA, J., dissenting) (citing \"`wide acceptance in the legal culture'\" as \"adequate reason not to overrule\" prior cases).</p>\n<p>Thus, in <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Swann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108319\"><a href=\"/opinion/108319/north-carolina-bd-of-ed-v-swann/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 45 (1971), this Court, citing <i>Swann,</i> restated the point. \"[S]chool authorities,\" the Court said, \"have wide discretion in formulating school policy, and . . . as a matter of educational policy school authorities may well conclude that some kind of racial balance in the schools is desirable quite apart from any constitutional requirements.\" ThenJ-ustice Rehnquist echoed this view in <i>Bustop, Inc.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110010\"><a href=\"/opinion/110010/bustop-inc-applicant-v-the-board-of-education-of-the-city-of-los/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1380</span></a></span>, 1383 (1978) (opinion in chambers), making clear that he too believed that <i>Swann</i>'s statement reflected settled law: \"While I have the gravest doubts that [a state supreme court] was <i>required</i> by the United States Constitution to take the [desegregation] action that it has taken in this case, I have very little doubt that it was <i>permitted</i> by that Constitution to take such action.\" (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p>These statements nowhere suggest that this freedom is limited to school districts where court-ordered desegregation measures are also in effect. Indeed, in <i>McDaniel,</i> a case decided the same day as <i>Swann,</i> a group of parents challenged a race-conscious student assignment plan that the Clarke County School Board had <i>voluntarily</i> adopted as a remedy without a court order (though under federal agency pressurepressure Seattle also encountered). The plan required that each elementary school in the district maintain 20% to 40% enrollment of African-American students, corresponding to the racial composition of the district. See <i>Barresi</i> v. <i>Browne,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1206904\"><a href=\"/opinion/1206904/barresi-v-browne/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 456-459, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1206904\"><a href=\"/opinion/1206904/barresi-v-browne/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span>, 650-651 (1970). This Court upheld the plan, see <i>McDaniel,</i> 402 U. S., at 41, rejecting the parents' argument that \"a person may not be <i>included</i> or <i>excluded</i> solely because he is a Negro or because he is white.\" Brief for Respondents in <i>McDaniel,</i> O. T. 1970, No. 420, p. 25.</p>\n<p>Federal authorities had claimedas the NAACP and the OCR did in Seattlethat Clarke County schools were segregated in law, not just in fact. The plurality's claim that Seattle was \"never segregated by law\" is simply not accurate. Compare <i>ante,</i> at 29, with <i>supra,</i> at 6-9. The plurality could validly claim that <i>no court</i> ever found that Seattle schools were segregated in law. But that is also true of the Clarke County schools in <i>McDaniel.</i> Unless we believe that the Constitution enforces one legal standard for the South and another for the North, this Court should grant Seattle the permission it granted Clarke County, Georgia. See <i>McDaniel,</i> 402 U. S., at 41 (\"[S]teps will almost invariably require that students be assigned `differently because of their race.' . . . Any other approach would freeze the status quo that is the very target of all desegregation processes.\").</p>\n<p>This Court has also held that school districts may be required by federal statute to undertake race-conscious desegregation efforts even when there is no likelihood that <i>de jure</i> segregation can be shown. In <i>Board of Ed. of City School Dist. of New York</i> v. <i>Harris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110160\"><a href=\"/opinion/110160/board-of-ed-of-city-school-dist-of-new-york-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 148-149 (1979), the Court concluded that a federal statute required school districts receiving certain federal funds to remedy faculty segregation, even though in this Court's view the racial disparities in the affected schools were purely <i>de facto</i> and would not have been actionable under the Equal Protection Clause. Not even the dissenters thought the race-conscious remedial program posed a <i>constitutional</i> problem. See <i>id.,</i> at 152 (opinion of Stewart, J.).

These decisions illustrate well how lower courts understood and followed <i>Swann</i>'s enunciation of the relevant legal principle.</p>\n<p>Courts are not alone in accepting as constitutionally valid the legal principle that <i>Swann</i> enunciated-<i>i.e.,</i> that the government may voluntarily adopt race-conscious measures to improve conditions of race even when it is not under a constitutional obligation to do so. That principle has been accepted by every branch of government and is rooted in the history of the Equal Protection Clause itself. Thus, Congress has enacted numerous race-conscious statutes that illustrate that principle or rely upon its validity. See, <i>e.g.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §6311(b)(2)(C)(v) (No Child Left Behind Act); §1067 <i>et seq.</i> (authorizing aid to minority institutions). In fact, without being exhaustive, I have counted 51 federal statutes that use racial classifications. I have counted well over 100 state statutes that similarly employ racial classifications. Presidential administrations for the past half-century have used and supported various race-conscious measures. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Exec. Order No. 10925, 26 Fed. Reg. 1977 (1961) (President Kennedy); Exec. Order No. 11246, 30 Fed. Reg. 12319 (1965) (President Johnson); Sugrue, Breaking Through: The Troubled Origins of Affirmative Action in the Workplace, in Colorlines: Affirmative Action, Immigration, and Civil Rights Options for America 31 (Skretny ed. 2001) (describing President Nixon's lobbying for affirmative action plans, <i>e.g.,</i> the Philadelphia Plan); White, Affirmative Action's Alamo: Gerald Ford Returns to Fight Once More for Michigan, Time, Aug. 23, 1999, p. 48 (reporting on President Ford's support for affirmative action); Schuck, Affirmative Action: Past, Present, and Future, 20 Yale L. &amp; Pol'y Rev. 1, 50 (2002) (describing President Carter's support for affirmation action). And during the same time, hundreds of local school districts have adopted student assignment plans that use race-conscious criteria. See Welch 83-91.</p>\n<p>That <i>Swann</i>'s legal statement should find such broad acceptance is not surprising. For <i>Swann</i> is predicated upon a well-established legal view of the Fourteenth Amendment. That view understands the basic objective of those who wrote the Equal Protection Clause as forbidding practices that lead to racial exclusion. The Amendment sought to bring into American society as full members those whom the Nation had previously held in slavery. See <i>Slaughter-House Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></span>, 71 (1872) (\"[N]o one can fail to be impressed with the one pervading purpose found in [all the Reconstruction amendments] . . . we mean the freedom of the slave race\"); <i>Strauder</i> v. <i>West Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></span>, 306 (1879) (\"[The Fourteenth Amendment] is one of a series of constitutional provisions having a common purpose; namely, securing to a race recently emancipated . . . all the civil rights that the superior race enjoy\").</p>\n<p>There is reason to believe that those who drafted an Amendment with this basic purpose in mind would have understood the legal and practical difference between the use of race-conscious criteria in defiance of that purpose, namely to keep the races apart, and the use of race-conscious criteria to further that purpose, namely to bring the races together. See generally R. Sears, A Utopian Experiment in Kentucky: Integration and Social Equality at Berea, 1866-1904 (1996) (describing federal funding, through the Freedman's Bureau, of race-conscious school integration programs). See also R. Fischer, The Segregation Struggle in Louisiana 1862-77, p. 51 (1974) (describing the use of race-conscious remedies); Harlan, Desegregation in New Orleans Public Schools During Reconstruction, 67 Am. Hist. Rev. 663, 664 (1962) (same); W. Vaughn, Schools for All: The Blacks and Public Education in the South, 1865-1877, pp. 111-116 (1974) (same). Although the Constitution almost always forbids the former, it is significantly more lenient in respect to the latter. See <i>Gratz</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 301 (2003) (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 243 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>Sometimes Members of this Court have disagreed about the degree of leniency that the Clause affords to programs designed to include. See <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 274 (1986); <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110338\"><a href=\"/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 507 (1980). But I can find no case in which this Court has followed JUSTICE THOMAS' \"colorblind\" approach. And I have found no case that otherwise repudiated this constitutional asymmetry between that which seeks to <i>exclude</i> and that which seeks to <i>include</i> members of minority races.</p>\n<p>What does the plurality say in response? First, it seeks to distinguish <i>Swann</i> and other similar cases on the ground that those cases involved remedial plans in response to <i>judicial findings</i> of <i>de jure</i> segregation. As <i>McDaniel</i> and <i>Harris</i> show, that is historically untrue. See <i>supra,</i> at 22-24. Many school districts in the South adopted segregation remedies (to which <i>Swann</i> clearly applies) without any such federal order<i>,</i> see <i>supra,</i> at 19-20. See also Kennedy Report. Seattle's circumstances are not meaningfully different from those in, say, <i>McDaniel,</i> where this Court approved race-conscious remedies. Louisville's plan was created and initially adopted when a compulsory district court order was in place. And, in any event, the histories of Seattle and Louisville make clear that this distinctionbetween court-ordered and voluntary desegregationseeks a line that sensibly cannot be drawn.</p>\n<p>Second, the plurality downplays the importance of <i>Swann</i> and related cases by frequently describing their relevant statements as \"dicta.\" These criticisms, however, miss the main point. <i>Swann</i> did not hide its understanding of the law in a corner of an obscure opinion or in a footnote, unread but by experts. It set forth its view prominently in an important opinion joined by all nine Justices, knowing that it would be read and followed throughout the Nation. The basic problem with the plurality's technical \"dicta\"-based response lies in its overly theoretical approach to case law, an approach that emphasizes rigid distinctions between holdings and dicta in a way that serves to mask the radical nature of today's decision. Law is not an exercise in mathematical logic. And statements of a legal rule set forth in a judicial opinion do not always divide neatly into \"holdings\" and \"dicta.\" (Consider the legal \"status\" of Justice Powell's separate opinion in <i>Regents of Univ. of Cal.</i> v. <i>Bakke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1978).) The constitutional principle enunciated in <i>Swann,</i> reiterated in subsequent cases, and relied upon over many years, provides, and has widely been thought to provide, authoritative legal guidance. And if the plurality now chooses to reject that principle, it cannot adequately justify its retreat simply by affixing the label \"dicta\" to reasoning with which it disagrees. Rather, it must explain to the courts and to the Nation <i>why</i> it would abandon guidance set forth many years before, guidance that countless others have built upon over time, and which the law has continuously embodied.</p>\n<p>Third, a more important response is the plurality's claim that later casesin particular <i>Johnson, Adarand,</i> and <i>Grutter</i>supplanted <i>Swann.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 11-12, 31-32, n. 16, 34-35 (citing <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 227; <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 505 (2005); <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 326 (2003)). The plurality says that cases such as <i>Swann</i> and the others I have described all \"were decided before this Court definitively determined that `all racial classifications . . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 31, n. 16 (quoting <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 227). This Court in <i>Adarand</i> added that \"such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests.\" <i>Ibid.</i> And the Court repeated this same statement in <i>Grutter.</i> See 539 U. S., at 326.</p>\n<p>Several of these cases were significantly more restrictive than <i>Swann</i> in respect to the degree of leniency the Fourteenth Amendment grants to programs designed to <i>include</i> people of all races. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Adarand, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Gratz, supra</i><i>; </i><i>Grutter, supra</i><i>.</i> But that legal circumstance cannot make a critical difference here for two separate reasons.</p>\n<p>First, no casenot <i>Adarand, Gratz, Grutter,</i> or any otherhas ever held that the test of \"strict scrutiny\" means that all racial classificationsno matter whether they seek to include or excludemust in practice be treated the same. The Court did not say in <i>Adarand</i> or in <i>Johnson</i> or in <i>Grutter</i> that it was overturning <i>Swann</i> or its central constitutional principle.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in its more recent opinions, the Court recognized that the \"fundamental purpose\" of strict scrutiny review is to \"take relevant differences\" between \"fundamentally different situations . . . into account.\" <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 228 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court made clear that \"[s]trict scrutiny does not trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable.\" <i>Ibid.</i> It added that the fact that a law \"treats [a person] unequally because of his or her race . . . says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 229-230 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the Court, using the very phrase that Justice Marshall had used to describe strict scrutiny's application to any <i>exclusionary</i> use of racial criteria, sought to \"<i>dispel the notion</i> that strict scrutiny\" is as likely to condemn <i>inclusive</i> uses of \"race-conscious\" criteria as it is to invalidate <i>exclusionary</i> uses. That is, it is <i>not</i> in all circumstances \"`strict in theory, but fatal in fact.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 237 (quoting <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)).</p>\n<p>The Court in <i>Grutter</i> elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote>\"Strict scrutiny is not `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' . . . Although all governmental uses of race are subject to strict scrutiny, not all are invalidated by it. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Context matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause. See <i>Gomillion</i> v. <i>Lightfoot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106127\"><a href=\"/opinion/106127/gomillion-v-lightfoot/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 343-344 (1960) (admonishing that, `in dealing with claims under broad provisions of the Constitution, which derive content by an interpretive process of inclusion and exclusion, it is imperative that generalizations, based on and qualified by the concrete situations that gave rise to them, must not be applied out of context in disregard of variant controlling facts'). . . . Not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable, and strict scrutiny is designed to provide a framework for carefully examining the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for the use of race in that particular context.\" 539 U. S., at 326-327.</blockquote>\n<p>The Court's holding in <i>Grutter</i> demonstrates that the Court meant what it said, for the Court upheld an elite law school's race-conscious admissions program.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the cases to which the plurality refers, though all applying strict scrutiny, do not treat exclusive and inclusive uses the same. Rather, they apply the strict scrutiny test in a manner that is \"fatal in fact\" only to racial classifications that harmfully <i>exclude;</i> they apply the test in a manner that is <i>not</i> fatal in fact to racial classifications that seek to <i>include.</i></p>\n<p>The plurality cannot avoid this simple fact. See <i>ante,</i> at 34-36. Today's opinion reveals that the plurality would rewrite this Court's prior jurisprudence, at least in practical application, transforming the \"strict scrutiny\" test into a rule that is fatal in fact across the board. In doing so, the plurality parts company from this Court's prior cases, and it takes from local government the longstanding legal right to use race-conscious criteria for inclusive purposes in limited ways.</p>\n<p>Second, as <i>Grutter</i> specified, \"[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action under the Equal Protection Clause.\" 539 U. S., at 327 (citing <i>Gomillion</i> v. <i>Lightfoot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106127\"><a href=\"/opinion/106127/gomillion-v-lightfoot/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span>, 343-344 (1960)). And contexts differ dramatically one from the other. Governmental use of race-based criteria can arise in the context of, for example, census forms, research expenditures for diseases, assignments of police officers patrolling predominantly minority-race neighborhoods, efforts to desegregate racially segregated schools, policies that favor minorities when distributing goods or services in short supply, actions that create majority-minority electoral districts, peremptory strikes that remove potential jurors on the basis of race, and others. Given the significant differences among these contexts, it would be surprising if the law required an identically strict legal test for evaluating the constitutionality of race-based criteria as to each of them.</p>\n<p>Here, the context is one in which school districts seek to advance or to maintain racial integration in primary and secondary schools. It is a context, as <i>Swann</i> makes clear, where history has required special administrative remedies. And it is a context in which the school boards' plans simply set race-conscious limits at the outer boundaries of a broad range.</p>\n<p>This context is <i>not</i> a context that involves the use of race to decide who will receive goods or services that are normally distributed on the basis of merit and which are in short supply. It is not one in which race-conscious limits stigmatize or exclude; the limits at issue do not pit the races against each other or otherwise significantly exacerbate racial tensions. They do not impose burdens unfairly upon members of one race alone but instead seek benefits for members of all races alike. The context here is one of racial limits that seek, not to keep the races apart, but to bring them together.</p>\n<p>The importance of these differences is clear once one compares the present circumstances with other cases where one or more of these negative features are present.

Compare <i>Wessmann</i> v. <i>Gittens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198211\"><a href=\"/opinion/198211/wessmann-v-gittens/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 809-810 (CA1 1998) (Boudin, J., concurring), with <i>Comfort,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 28-29 (Boudin, C. J., concurring). They do not seek to award a scarce commodity on the basis of merit, for they are not magnet schools; rather, by design and in practice, they offer substantially equivalent academic programs and electives. Although some parents or children prefer some schools over others, school popularity has varied significantly over the years. In 2000, for example, Roosevelt was the most popular first choice high school in Seattle; in 2001, Ballard was the most popular; in 2000, West Seattle was one of the least popular; by 2003, it was one of the more popular. See Research, Evaluation and Assessment, Student Information Services Office, District Summaries 1999-2005, available at http://www.seattleschools.org/area/siso/disprof/2005/DP05 all.pdf. In a word, the school plans under review do not involve the kind of race-based harm that has led this Court, in other contexts, to find the use of race-conscious criteria unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>These and related considerations convinced one Ninth Circuit judge in the Seattle case to apply a standard of constitutionality review that is less than \"strict,\" and to conclude that this Court's precedents do not require the contrary. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792253\"><a href=\"/opinion/792253/parents-involved-in-community-schools-a-washington-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1193-1194 (2005) (Kozinski, J., concurring) (\"That a student is denied the school of his choice may be disappointing, but it carries no racial stigma and says nothing at all about that individual's aptitude or ability\"). That judge is not alone. Cf. <i>Gratz, supra,</i> at 301 (GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 243 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Carter, When Victims Happen To Be Black, 97 Yale L. J. 420, 433-434 (1988).</p>\n<p>The view that a more lenient standard than \"strict scrutiny\" should apply in the present context would not imply abandonment of judicial efforts carefully to determine the need for race-conscious criteria and the criteria's tailoring in light of the need. And the present context requires a court to examine carefully the race-conscious program at issue. In doing so, a reviewing judge must be fully aware of the potential dangers and pitfalls that JUSTICE THOMAS and JUSTICE KENNEDY mention. See <i>ante,</i> at 11-12 (THOMAS, J., concurring); <i>ante,</i> at 3, 17 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.).</p>\n<p>But unlike the plurality, such a judge would also be aware that a legislature or school administrators, ultimately accountable to the electorate, could <i>nonetheless</i> properly conclude that a racial classification sometimes serves a purpose important enough to overcome the risks they mention, for example, helping to end racial isolation or to achieve a diverse student body in public schools. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 17-18 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Where that is so, the judge would carefully examine the program's details to determine whether the use of race-conscious criteria is proportionate to the important ends it serves.</p>\n<p>In my view, this contextual approach to scrutiny is altogether fitting. I believe that the law requires application here of a standard of review that is not \"strict\" in the traditional sense of that word, although it does require the careful review I have just described. See <i>Gratz, supra,</i> at 301 (GINSBURG, J., joined by SOUTER, J., dissenting); <i>Adarand, supra,</i> at 242-249 (STEVENS, J., joined by GINSBURG, J., dissenting); <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1193-1194 (Kozinski, J., concurring). Apparently JUSTICE KENNEDY also agrees that strict scrutiny would not apply in respect to certain \"race-conscious\" school board policies. See <i>ante,</i> at 9 (\"Executive and legislative branches, which for generations now have considered these types of policies and procedures, should be permitted to employ them with candor and with confidence that a constitutional violation does not occur whenever a decisionmaker considers the impact a given approach might have on students of different races\").</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, in light of <i>Grutter</i> and other precedents, see, <i>e.g., </i><i>Bakke,</i> 438 U. S., at 290 (opinion of Powell, J.), I shall adopt the first alternative. I shall apply the version of strict scrutiny that those cases embody. I shall consequently ask whether the school boards in Seattle and Louisville adopted these plans to serve a \"compelling governmental interest\" and, if so, whether the plans are \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve that interest. If the plans survive this strict review, they would survive less exacting review <i>a fortiori.</i> Hence, I conclude that the plans before us pass both parts of the strict scrutiny test. Consequently I must conclude that the plans here are permitted under the Constitution.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Applying the Legal Standard</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Compelling Interest</i></h2>\n<p>The principal interest advanced in these cases to justify the use of race-based criteria goes by various names. Sometimes a court refers to it as an interest in achieving racial \"diversity.\" Other times a court, like the plurality here, refers to it as an interest in racial \"balancing.\" I have used more general terms to signify that interest, describing it, for example, as an interest in promoting or preserving greater racial \"integration\" of public schools. By this term, I mean the school districts' interest in eliminating school-by-school racial isolation and increasing the degree to which racial mixture characterizes each of the district's schools and each individual student's public school experience.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its name, however, the interest at stake possesses three essential elements. First, there is a historical and remedial element: an interest in setting rightthe consequences of prior conditions of segregation. This refers back to a time when public schools were highly segregated, often as a result of legal or administrative policies that facilitated racial segregation in public schools. It is an interest in continuing to combat the remnants of segregation caused in whole or in part by these school-related policies, which have often affected not only schools, but also housing patterns, employment practices, economic conditions, and social attitudes. It is an interest in maintaining hard-won gains. And it has its roots in preventing what gradually may become the <i>de facto</i> resegregation of America's public schools. See Part I, <i>supra,</i> at 4; Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> See also <i>ante,</i> at 17 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) (\"This Nation has a moral and ethical obligation to fulfill its historic commitment to creating an integrated society that ensures equal opportunity for all of its children\").</p>\n<p>Second, there is an educational element: an interest in overcoming the adverse educational effects produced by and associated with highly segregated schools. Cf. <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S.<i>,</i> at 345 (GINSBURG, J., concurring). Studies suggest that children taken from those schools and placed in integrated settings often show positive academic gains. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Powell, Living and Learning: Linking Housing and Education, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy 15, 35 (J. Powell, G. Kearney, &amp; V. Kay eds. 2001) (hereinafter Powell); Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social Science Evidence, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. J. 733, 741-742 (1998) (hereinafter Hallinan).</p>\n<p>Other studies reach different conclusions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> D. Armor, Forced Justice (1995). See also <i>ante,</i> at 15-17 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But the evidence supporting an educational interest in racially integrated schools is well established and strong enough to permit a democratically elected school board reasonably to determine that this interest is a compelling one.</p>\n<p>Research suggests, for example, that black children from segregated educational environments significantly increase their achievement levels once they are placed in a more integrated setting. Indeed in Louisville itself the achievement gap between black and white elementary school students grew substantially smaller (by seven percentage points) after the integration plan was implemented in 1975. See Powell 35. Conversely, to take another example, evidence from a district in Norfolk, Virginia, shows that resegregated schools led to a decline in the achievement test scores of children of all races. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>One commentator, reviewing dozens of studies of the educational benefits of desegregated schooling, found that the studies have provided \"remarkably consistent\" results, showing that: (1) black students' educational achievement is improved in integrated schools as compared to racially isolated schools, (2) black students' educational achievement is improved in integrated classes, and (3) the earlier that black students are removed from racial isolation, the better their educational outcomes. See Hallinan 741-742. Multiple studies also indicate that black alumni of integrated schools are more likely to move into occupations traditionally closed to African-Americans, and to earn more money in those fields. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Schofield, Review of Research on School Desegregation's Impact on Elementary and Secondary School Students, in Handbook of Research on Multicultural Education 597, 606-607 (J. Banks &amp; C. Banks eds. 1995). Cf. W. Bowen &amp; D. Bok, The Shape of the River 118 (1998) (hereinafter Bowen &amp; Bok).</p>\n<p>Third, there is a democratic element: an interest in producing an educational environment that reflects the \"pluralistic society\" in which our children will live. <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 16. It is an interest in helping our children learn to work and play together with children of different racial backgrounds. It is an interest in teaching children to engage in the kind of cooperation among Americans of all races that is necessary to make a land of three hundred million people one Nation.</p>\n<p>Again, data support this insight. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Hallinan 745; Quillian &amp; Campbell, Beyond Black and White: The Present and Future of Multiracial Friendship Segregation, 68 Am. Sociological Rev. 540, 541 (2003) (hereinafter Quillian &amp; Campbell); Dawkins &amp; Braddock, The Continuing Significance of Desegregation: School Racial Composition and African American Inclusion in American Society, 63 J. Negro Ed. 394, 401-403 (1994) (hereinafter Dawkins &amp; Braddock); Wells &amp; Crain, Perpetuation Theory and the Long-Term Effects of School Desegregation, 64 Rev. Educational Research 531, 550 (1994) (hereinafter Wells &amp; Crain).</p>\n<p>There are again studies that offer contrary conclusions. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Schofield, School Desegregation and Intergroup Relations, in 17 Review of Research in Education 356 (G. Grant ed. 1991). See also <i>ante,</i> at 22-23 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Again, however, the evidence supporting a democratic interest in racially integrated schools is firmly established and sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine, as this Court has itself often found, that this interest is compelling.</p>\n<p>For example, one study documented that \"black and white students in desegregated schools are less racially prejudiced than those in segregated schools,\" and that \"interracial contact in desegregated schools leads to an increase in interracial sociability and friendship.\" Hallinan 745. See also Quillian &amp; Campbell 541. Cf. Bowen &amp; Bok 155. Other studies have found that both black and white students who attend integrated schools are more likely to work in desegregated companies after graduation than students who attended racially isolated schools. Dawkins &amp; Braddock 401-403; Wells &amp; Crain 550. Further research has shown that the desegregation of schools can help bring adult communities together by reducing segregated housing. Cities that have implemented successful school desegregation plans have witnessed increased interracial contact and neighborhoods that tend to become less racially segregated. Dawkins &amp; Braddock 403. These effects not only reinforce the prior gains of integrated primary and secondary education; they also foresee a time when there is less need to use race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this Court from <i>Swann</i> to <i>Grutter</i> has treated these civic effects as an important virtue of racially diverse education. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann, supra,</i> at 16; <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> 458 U. S., at 472-473. In <i>Grutter,</i> in the context of law school admissions, we found that these types of interests were, constitutionally speaking, \"compelling.\" See 539 U. S., at 330 (recognizing that Michigan Law School's race-conscious admissions policy \"promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand persons of different races,\" and pointing out that \"the skills needed in today's increasingly global marketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and viewpoints\" (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)).</p>\n<p>In light of this Court's conclusions in <i>Grutter,</i> the \"compelling\" nature of these interests in the context of primary and secondary public education follows here <i>a fortiori.</i> Primary and secondary schools are where the education of this Nation's children begins, where each of us begins to absorb those values we carry with us to the end of our days. As Justice Marshall said, \"unless our children begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.\" <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109102\"><a href=\"/opinion/109102/milliken-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></a></span>, 783 (1974) (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>And it was <i>Brown,</i> after all, focusing upon primary and secondary schools, not <i>Sweatt</i> v. <i>Painter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104804\"><a href=\"/opinion/104804/sweatt-v-painter/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span> (1950), focusing on law schools, or <i>McLaurin</i> v. <i>Oklahoma</i> <i>State Regents for Higher Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104805\"><a href=\"/opinion/104805/mclaurin-v-oklahoma-state-regents-for-higher-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span> (1950), focusing on graduate schools, that affected so deeply not only Americans but the world.

Hence, I am not surprised that JUSTICE KENNEDY finds that, \"a district may consider it a compelling interest to achieve a diverse student population,\" including a <i>racially</i> diverse population. <i>Ante,</i> at 17-18.</p>\n<p>The compelling interest at issue here, then, includes an effort to eradicate the remnants, not of general \"societal discrimination,\" <i>ante,</i> at 23 (plurality opinion), but of primary and secondary school segregation, see <i>supra,</i> at 7, 14; it includes an effort to create school environments that provide better educational opportunities for all children; it includes an effort to help create citizens better prepared to know, to understand, and to work with people of all races and backgrounds, thereby furthering the kind of democratic government our Constitution foresees. If an educational interest that combines these three elements is not \"compelling,\" what is?</p>\n<p>The majority acknowledges that in prior cases this Court has recognized at least two interests as compelling: an interest in \"remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination,\" and an interest in \"diversity in higher education.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 12, 13. But the plurality does not convincingly explain why those interests do not constitute a \"compelling interest\" here. How do the remedial interests here differ in kind from those at issue in the voluntary desegregation efforts that Attorney General Kennedy many years ago described in his letter to the President? <i>Supra,</i> at 19-20. How do the educational and civic interests differ in kind from those that underlie and justify the racial \"diversity\" that the law school sought in <i>Grutter,</i> where this Court found a compelling interest?</p>\n<p>The plurality tries to draw a distinction by reference to the well-established conceptual difference between <i>de jure</i> segregation (\"segregation by state action\") and <i>de facto</i> segregation (\"racial imbalance caused by other factors\"). <i>Ante,</i> at 28. But that distinction concerns what the Constitution <i>requires</i> school boards to do, not what it <i>permits</i> them to do. Compare, <i>e.g., </i><i>Green,</i> 391 U. S., at 437-438 (\"School boards . . . operating state-compelled dual systems\" have an \"affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system inw hich racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch\"), with, <i>e.g., </i><i>Milliken,</i> 418 U. S., at 745 (the Constitution does not impose a duty to desegregate upon districts that have not been \"shown to have committed any constitutional violation\").</p>\n<p>The opinions cited by the plurality to justify its reliance upon the <i>de jure/de facto</i> distinction only address what remedial measures a school district may be constitutionally <i>required</i> to undertake. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Freeman</i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 495 (1992). As to what is <i>permitted,</i> nothing in our equal protection law suggests that a State may right only those wrongs that it committed. No case of this Court has ever relied upon the <i>de jure/de facto</i> distinction in order to limit what a school district is voluntarily allowed to do. That is what is at issue here. And <i>Swann, McDaniel, Crawford, North Carolina Bd. of Ed., Harris,</i> and <i>Bustop</i> made one thing clear: significant as the difference between <i>de jure</i> and <i>de facto</i> segregation may be to the question of what a school district <i>must</i> do, that distinction is not germane to the question of what a school district <i>may</i> do.</p>\n<p>Nor does any precedent indicate, as the plurality suggests with respect to Louisville, <i>ante,</i> at 29, that remedial interests vanish the day after a federal court declares that a district is \"unitary.\" Of course, Louisville adopted those portions of the plan at issue here <i>before</i> a court declared Louisville \"unitary.\" Moreover, in <i>Freeman,</i> this Court pointed out that in \"one sense of the term, vestiges of past segregation by state decree do remain in our society and in our schools. Past wrongs to the black race, wrongs committed by the State and in its name, are a stubborn fact of history. And stubborn facts of history linger and persist.\" 503 U. S., at 495. See also <i>ante,</i> at 15 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). I do not understand why this Court's cases, which rest the significance of a \"unitary\" finding in part upon the wisdom and desirability of returning schools to local control, should deprive those local officials of legal <i>permission</i> to use means they once found necessary to combat persisting injustices.</p>\n<p>For his part, JUSTICE THOMAS faults my citation of various studies supporting the view that school districts can find compelling educational and civic interests in integrating their public schools. See <i>ante,</i> at 15-17, 23 (concurring opinion). He is entitled of course to his own opinion as to which studies he finds convincingalthough it bears mention that even the author of some of JUSTICE THOMAS' preferred studies has found <i>some</i> evidence linking integrated learning environments to increased academic achievement. Cf. <i>ante,</i> at 15-17 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing Armor &amp; Rossell, Desegregation and Resegregation in the Public Schools, in Beyond the Color Line 239 (A. Thernstrom &amp; S. Thernstrom eds. 2002); Brief for Armor <i>et al.</i> as <i>Amici Curiae,</i> with Rosen, Perhaps Not All Affirmative Action is Created Equal, N. Y. Times, June 11, 2006 (quoting David Armor as commenting \"`[w]e did find the [racial] achievement gap changing <i>significantly</i>'\" and acknowledging that he \"`did find a modest association for math but not reading in terms of racial composition and achievement, but there's a big state variation'\" (emphasis added)). If we are to insist upon unanimity in the social science literature before finding a compelling interest, we might never find one. I believe only that the Constitution allows democratically elected school boards to make up their own minds as to how best to include people of all races in one America.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Narrow Tailoring</i></h2>\n<p>I next ask whether the plans before us are \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve these \"compelling\" objectives. I shall not accept the school board's assurances on faith, cf. <i>Miller </i> v. <i>Johnson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, 920 (1995), and I shall subject the \"tailoring\" of their plans to \"rigorous judicial review.\" <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 388 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting). Several factors, taken together, nonetheless lead me to conclude that the boards' use of race-conscious criteria in these plans passes even the strictest \"tailoring\" test.</p>\n<p>First, the race-conscious criteria at issue only help set the outer bounds of <i>broad</i> ranges. Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 390 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (expressing concern about \"narrow fluctuation band[s]\"). They constitute but one part of plans that depend primarily upon other, nonracial elements. To use race in this way is not to set a forbidden \"quota.\" See <i>id.,</i> at 335 (\"Properly understood, a `quota' is a program in which a certain fixed number or proportion of opportunities are `reserved exclusively for certain minority groups'\" (quoting <i>Croson,</i> 488 U. S., at 496)).</p>\n<p>In fact, the defining feature of both plans is greater emphasis upon student choice. In Seattle, for example, in more than 80% of all cases, that choice alone determines which high schools Seattle's ninth graders will attend. After ninth grade, students can decide voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of race-conscious criteria). <i>Choice,</i> therefore, is the \"predominant factor\" in these plans. <i>Race</i> is not. See <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 393 (KENNEDY, J., dissenting) (allowing consideration of race only if it does \"not become a predominant factor\").</p>\n<p>Indeed, the race-conscious ranges at issue in these cases often have no effect, either because the particular school is not oversubscribed in the year in question, or because the racial makeup of the school falls within the broad range, or because the student is a transfer applicant or has a sibling at the school. In these respects, the broad ranges are less like a quota and more like the kinds of \"useful starting points\" that this Court has consistently found permissible, even when they set boundaries upon voluntary transfers, and even when they are based upon a community's general population. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.</i> v. <i>Swann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108319\"><a href=\"/opinion/108319/north-carolina-bd-of-ed-v-swann/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 46 (1971) (no \"absolute prohibition against [the] use\" of mathematical ratios as a \"starting point\"); <i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 24-25 (approving the use of a ratio reflecting \"the racial composition of the whole school system\" as a \"useful starting point,\" but not as an \"inflexible requirement\"). Cf. <i>United States</i> v. <i>Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107950\"><a href=\"/opinion/107950/united-states-v-montgomery-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span>, 232 (1969) (approving a lower court desegregation order that \"provided that the [school] board must move toward a goal under which `in each school the ratio of white to Negro faculty members is substantially the same as it is throughout the system,'\" and \"immediately\" requiring \"[t]he ratio of Negro to white teachers\" in each school to be equal to \"the ratio of Negro to white teachers in . . . the system as a whole\").</p>\n<p>Second, broad-range limits on voluntary school choice plans are less burdensome, and hence more narrowly tailored, see <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 341, than other race-conscious restrictions this Court has previously approved. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann, supra,</i> at 26-27; <i>Montgomery Co. </i><i>Bd. of Ed., supra,</i> at 232. Indeed, the plans before us are <i>more narrowly tailored</i> than the race-conscious admission plans that this Court approved in <i>Grutter.</i> Here, race becomes a factor only in a fraction of students' non-merit-based assignmentsnot in large numbers of students' merit-based applications. Moreover, the effect of applying race-conscious criteria here affects potentially disadvantaged students <i>less severely,</i> not more severely, than the criteria at issue in <i>Grutter.</i> Disappointed students are not rejected from a State's flagship graduate program; they simply attend a different one of the district's many public schools, which in aspiration and in fact are substantially equal. Cf. <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 283. And, in Seattle, the disadvantaged student loses at most one year at the high school of his choice. One will search <i>Grutter</i> in vain for similarly persuasive evidence of narrow tailoring as the school districts have presented here.</p>\n<p>Third, the manner in which the school boards developed these plans itself reflects \"narrow tailoring.\" Each plan was devised to overcome a history of segregated public schools. Each plan embodies the results of local experience and community consultation. Each plan is the product of a process that has sought to enhance student choice, while diminishing the need for mandatory busing. And each plan's use of race-conscious elements is <i>diminished</i> compared to the use of race in preceding integration plans.</p>\n<p>The school boards' widespread consultation, their experimentation with numerous other plans, indeed, the 40-year history that Part I sets forth, make clear that plans that are less explicitly race-based are unlikely to achieve the board's \"compelling\" objectives. The history of each school system reveals highly segregated schools, followed by remedial plans that involved forced busing, followed by efforts to attract or retain students through the use of plans that abandoned busing and replaced it with greater student choice. Both cities once tried to achieve more integrated schools by relying solely upon measures such as redrawn district boundaries, new school building construction, and unrestricted voluntary transfers. In neither city did these prior attempts prove sufficient to achieve the city's integration goals. See Parts IA and IB, <i>supra,</i> at 6-18<i>.</i></p>\n<p>Moreover, giving some degree of weight to a local school board's knowledge, expertise, and concerns in these particular matters is not inconsistent with rigorous judicial scrutiny. It simply recognizes that judges are not well suited to act as school administrators. Indeed, in the context of school desegregation, this Court has repeatedly stressed the importance of acknowledging that local school boards better understand their own communities and have a better knowledge of what in practice will best meet the educational needs of their pupils. See <i>Milliken,</i> 418 U. S., at 741-42 (\"No single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools; local autonomy has long been thought essential both to the maintenance of community concern and support for public schools and to quality of the educational process\"). See also <i>San Antonio Independent School Dist. </i> v. <i>Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 49-50 (1973) (extolling local control for \"the opportunity it offers for participation in the decisionmaking process that determines how . . . local tax dollars will be spent.

School authorities have the primary responsibility for elucidating, assessing, and solving these problems; courts will have to consider whether the action of school authorities constitutes good faith implementation of the governing constitutional principles\").</p>\n<p>Experience in Seattle and Louisville is consistent with experience elsewhere. In 1987, the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights studied 125 large school districts seeking integration. It reported that most districts-92 of them, in factadopted desegregation policies that combined two or more highly race-conscious strategies, for example, rezoning or pairing. See Welch 83-91.</p>\n<p>Having looked at dozens of <i>amicus</i> briefs, public reports, news stories, and the records in many of this Court's prior cases, which together span 50 years of desegregation history in school districts across the Nation, I have discovered many examples of districts that sought integration through explicitly race-conscious methods, including mandatory busing. Yet, I have found <i>no</i> example or model that would permit this Court to say to Seattle and to Louisville: \"Here is an instance of a desegregation plan that is likely to achieve your objectives and also makes less use of race-conscious criteria than your plans.\" And, if the plurality cannot suggest such a modeland it cannotthen it seeks to impose a \"narrow tailoring\" requirement that in practice would never be met.</p>\n<p>Indeed, if there is no such plan, or if such plans are purely imagined, it is understandable why, as the plurality notes, <i>ante,</i> at 27, Seattle school officials concentrated on diminishing the racial component of their districts' plan, but did not pursue eliminating that element entirely. For the plurality now to insist as it does, <i>ante,</i> at 27-28, that these school districts ought to have said so officially is either to ask for the superfluous (if they need only make explicit what is implicit) or to demand the impossible (if they must somehow provide more proof that there is no hypothetical <i>other</i> plan that could work as well as theirs). I am not aware of any case in which this Court has read the \"narrow tailoring\" test to impose such a requirement. Cf. <i>People Who Care</i> v. <i>Rockford Bd. of Ed. School Dist. No. 205,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581562\"><a href=\"/opinion/581562/people-who-care-v-rockford-board-of-education-school-district-no-205-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1335</span></a></span>, 1338 (CA7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (\"Would it be necessary to adjudicate the obvious before adopting (or permitting the parties to agree on) a remedy . . . ?\").</p>\n<p>The plurality also points to the school districts' use of numerical goals based upon the racial breakdown of the general school population, and it faults the districts for failing to prove that <i>no other set of numbers will work.</i> See <i>ante,</i> at 18-20. The plurality refers to no case in support of its demand. Nor is it likely to find such a case. After all, this Court has in many cases explicitly permitted districts to use target ratios based upon the district's underlying population. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Swann,</i> 402 U. S., at 24-25; <i>North Carolina Bd. of Ed.,</i> 402 U. S., at 46; <i>Montgomery County Bd. of Ed.,</i> 395 U. S., at 232. The reason is obvious: In Seattle, where the overall student population is 41% white, permitting 85% white enrollment at a single school would make it much more likely that other schools would have very few white students, whereas in Jefferson County, with a 60% white enrollment, one school with 85% white students would be less likely to skew enrollments elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is research-based evidence supporting, for example, that a ratio no greater than 50% minority which is Louisville's starting point, and as close as feasible to Seattle's starting pointis helpful in limiting the risk of \"white flight.\" See Orfield, Metropolitan School Desegregation: Impacts on Metropolitan Society, in Pursuit of a Dream Deferred: Linking Housing and Education Policy 121, 125. Federal law also assumes that a similar target percentage will help avoid detrimental \"minority group isolation.\" See No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Title V, Part C, 115 Stat. 1806, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §7231 <i>et seq.</i> (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 34 CFR §§280.2, 280.4 (2006) (implementing regulations). What other numbers are the boards to use as a \"starting point\"? Are they to spend days, weeks, or months seeking independently to validate the use of ratios that this Court has repeatedly authorized in prior cases? Are they to draw numbers out of thin air? These districts have followed this Court's holdings and advice in \"tailoring\" their plans. That, too, strongly supports the lawfulness of their methods.</p>\n<p>Nor could the school districts have accomplished their desired aims (<i>e.g.,</i> avoiding forced busing, countering white flight, maintaining racial diversity) by other means. Nothing in the extensive history of desegregation efforts over the past 50 years gives the districts, or this Court, any reason to believe that another method is possible to accomplish these goals. Nevertheless, JUSTICE KENNEDY suggests that school boards:</p>\n<blockquote>\"may pursue the goal of bringing together students of diverse backgrounds and races through other means, including strategic site selection of new schools; drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods; allocating resources for special programs; recruiting students and faculty in a targeted fashion; and tracking enrollments, performance, and other statistics by race.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 8.</blockquote>\n<p>But, as to \"strategic site selection,\" Seattle has built one new high school in the last 44 years (and that specialized school serves only 300 students). In fact, six of the Seattle high schools involved in this case were built by the 1920's; the other four were open by the early 1960's. See generally N. Thompson &amp; C. Marr, Building for Learning: Seattle Public Schools Histories, 1862-2000 (2002). As to \"drawing\" neighborhood \"attendance zones\" on a racial basis, Louisville tried it, and it worked only when forced busing was also part of the plan. See <i>supra,</i> at 12-14. As to \"allocating resources for special programs,\" Seattle and Louisville have both experimented with this; indeed, these programs are often referred to as \"magnet schools,\" but the limited desegregation effect of these efforts extends at most to those few schools to which additional resources are granted. In addition, there is no evidence from the experience of these school districts that it will make any meaningful impact. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, p. 42. As to \"recruiting faculty\" on the basis of race, both cities have tried, but only as one part of a broader program. As to \"tracking enrollments, performance and other statistics by race,\" tracking <i>reveals</i> the problem; it does not cure it.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY sets forth two additional concerns related to \"narrow tailoring.\" In respect to Louisville, he says first that officials stated (1) that kindergarten assignments are not subject to the race-conscious guidelines, and (2) that the child at issue here was denied permission to attend the kindergarten he wanted because of those guidelines. Both, he explains, cannot be true. He adds that this confusion illustrates that Louisville's assignment plan (or its explanation of it to this Court) is insufficiently precise in respect to \"who makes the decisions,\" \"over-sight,\" \"the precise circumstances in which an assignment decision\" will be made; and \"which of two similarly situated children will be subjected to a given race-based decision.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 4.</p>\n<p>The record suggests, however, that the child in question was not assigned to the school he preferred because he missed the kindergarten application deadline. See App. in 05-915, p. 20. After he had enrolled and after the academic year had begun, he then applied to transfer to his preferred school after the kindergarten assignment dead-line had passed, <i>id.,</i> at 21, possibly causing school officials to treat his late request as an application to transfer to the first grade, in respect to which the guidelines apply. I am not certain just how the remainder of JUSTICE KENNEDY's concerns affect the lawfulness of the Louisville program, for they seem to be failures of explanation, not of administration. But Louisville should be able to answer the relevant questions on remand.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY's second concern is directly related to the merits of Seattle's plan: Why does Seattle's plan group Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Native-Americans, and African-Americans together, treating all as similar minorities? <i>Ante,</i> at 6-7. The majority suggests that Seattle's classification system could permit a school to be labeled \"diverse\" with a 50% Asian-American and 50% white student body, and no African-American students, Hispanic students, or students of other ethnicity. <i>Ante,</i> at 6; <i>ante,</i> at 15-16 (opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p>The 50/50 hypothetical has no support in the record here; it is conjured from the imagination. In fact, Seattle apparently began to treat these different minority groups alike in response to the federal Emergency School Aid Act's requirement that it do so. Siqueland 116-117. See also Hanawalt 31; Pub. L. 95-561, Tit. VI (1978) (prescribing percentage enrollment requirements for \"minority\" students); Siqueland 55 (discussing HEW definition of \"minority\"). Moreover, maintaining this federally mandated system of classification makes sense insofar as Seattle's experience indicates that the relevant circumstances in respect to each of these different minority groups are roughly similar, <i>e.g.,</i> in terms of residential patterns, and call for roughly similar responses. This is confirmed by the fact that Seattle has been able to achieve a desirable degree of diversity without the <i>greater</i> emphasis on race that drawing fine lines among minority groups would require. Does the plurality's view of the Equal Protection Clause mean that courts must give no weight to such a board determination? Does it insist upon especially strong evidence supporting inclusion of multiple minority groups in an otherwise lawful government minority-ssistance program? If so, its interpretation threatens to produce divisiveness among minority groups that is incompatible with the basic objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment. Regardless, the plurality cannot object that the constitutional defect is the individualized use of race and simultaneously object that not enough account of individuals' race has been taken.</p>\n<p>Finally, I recognize that the Court seeks to distinguish <i>Grutter</i> from these cases by claiming that <i>Grutter</i> arose in \"`the context of higher education.'\" <i>Ante,</i> at 16. But that is not a meaningful legal distinction. I have explained why I do not believe the Constitution could possibly find \"compelling\" the provision of a racially diverse education for a 23-year-old law student but not for a 13-year-old high school pupil. See <i>supra,</i> at 46-48. And I have explained how the plans before us are more narrowly tailored than those in <i>Grutter.</i> See <i>supra,</i> at 45. I add that one cannot find a relevant distinction in the fact that these school districts did not examine the merits of applications \"individual[ly].\" See <i>ante,</i> at 13-15. The context here does not involve admission by merit; a child's academic, artistic, and athletic \"merits\" are not at all relevant to the child's placement. These are not affirmative action plans, and hence \"individualized scrutiny\" is simply beside the point.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that these plans' specific features(1) their limited and historically-diminishing use of race, (2) their strong reliance upon other non-race-conscious elements, (3) their history and the manner in which the districts developed and modified their approach, (4) the comparison with prior plans, and (5) the lack of reasonably evident alternativestogether show that the districts' plans are \"narrowly tailored\" to achieve their \"compelling\" goals. In sum, the districts' race-conscious plans satisfy \"strict scrutiny\" and are therefore lawful.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Direct Precedent</i></h2>\n<p>Two additional precedents more directly related to the plans here at issue reinforce my conclusion. The first consists of the District Court determination in the Louisville case when it dissolved its desegregation order that there was \"overwhelming evidence of the Board's good faith compliance with the desegregation Decree and its underlying purposes,\" indeed that the Board had \"treated the ideal of an integrated system as much more than a legal obligationthey consider it a positive, desirable policy and an essential element of any well-rounded public school education.\" <i>Hampton II,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 370. When the court made this determination in 2000, it did so in the context of the Louisville desegregation plan that the board had adopted in 1996. That plan, which took effect before 1996, is the very plan that in all relevant respects is in effect now and is the subject of the present challenge.</p>\n<p>No one claims that (the relevant portion of) Louisville's plan was unlawful in 1996 when Louisville adopted it. To the contrary, there is every reason to believe that it represented part of an effort to implement the 1978 desegregation order. But if the plan was lawful when it was first adopted and if it was lawful the day before the District Court dissolved its order, how can the plurality now suggest that it became <i>unlawful</i> the following day? Is it conceivable that the Constitution, implemented through a court desegregation order, could permit (perhaps <i>require</i>) the district to make use of a race-conscious plan the day before the order was dissolved and then <i>forbid</i> the district to use the identical plan the day after? See <i>id.,</i> at 380 (\"The very analysis for dissolving desegregation decrees supports continued maintenance of a desegregated system as a compelling state interest\"). The Equal Protection Clause is not incoherent. And federal courts would rightly hesitate to find unitary status if the consequences of the ruling were so dramatically disruptive.</p>\n<p>Second, <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, is directly on point. That case involves the original Seattle Plan, a <i>more heavily race-conscious predecessor</i> of the very plan now before us. In <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> this Court struck down a state referendum that effectively barred implementation of Seattle's desegregation plan and \"burden[ed] all future attempts to integrate Washington schools in districts throughout the State.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 462-463, 483. Because the referendum would have prohibited the adoption of a school-integration plan that involved mandatory busing, and because it would have imposed a special burden on school integration plans (plans that sought to integrate previously segregated schools), the Court found it unconstitutional. <i>Id.,</i> at 483-487.</p>\n<p>In reaching this conclusion, the Court did not directly address the constitutional merits of the underlying Seattle plan. But it explicitly cited <i>Swann</i>'s statement that the Constitution permitted a local district to adopt such a plan. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15. It also cited to Justice Powell's opinion in <i>Bakke, approving of</i> the limited use of race-conscious criteria in a university-admissions \"affirmative action\" case. 458 U. S., at 472, n. 15<i>.</i> In addition, the Court stated that \"[a]ttending an ethnically diverse school,\" <i>id.,</i> at 473, could help prepare \"minority children for citizenship in our pluralistic society,\" hope-fully \"teaching members of the racial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>It is difficult to believe that the Court that held unconstitutional a referendum that would have interfered with the implementation of this plan thought that the integration plan it sought to preserve was itself an <i>unconstitutional</i> plan. And if <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1</i> is premised upon the constitutionality of the original Seattle Plan, it is equally premised upon the constitutionality of the present plan, for the present plan <i>is</i> the Seattle Plan, modified only insofar as it places even <i>less</i> emphasis on race-conscious elements than its predecessors.</p>\n<p>It is even more difficult to accept the plurality's contrary view, namely that the underlying plan was unconstitutional. If that is so, then <i>all</i> of Seattle's earlier (even more race-conscious) plans must also have been unconstitutional. That necessary implication of the plurality's position strikes the 13th chime of the clock. How could the plurality adopt a constitutional standard that would hold unconstitutional large numbers of race-conscious integration plans adopted by numerous school boards over the past 50 years while remaining true to this Court's desegregation precedent?</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Consequences</i></h2>\n<p>The Founders meant the Constitution as a practical document that would transmit its basic values to future generations through principles that remained workable over time. Hence it is important to consider the potential consequences of the plurality's approach, as measured against the Constitution's objectives. To do so provides further reason to believe that the plurality's approach is legally unsound.</p>\n<p>For one thing, consider the effect of the plurality's views on the parties before us and on similar school districts throughout the Nation. Will Louisville and all similar school districts have to return to systems like Louisville's initial 1956 plan, which did not consider race at all? See <i>supra,</i> at 12. That initial 1956 plan proved ineffective. Sixteen years into the plan, 14 of 19 middle and high schools remained almost totally white or almost totally black. <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>The districts' past and current plans are not unique. They resemble other plans, promulgated by hundreds of local school boards, which have attempted a variety of desegregation methods that have evolved over time in light of experience. A 1987 Civil Rights Commission Study of 125 school districts in the Nation demonstrated the breadth and variety of desegregation plans:</p>\n<blockquote>\"The [study] documents almost 300 desegregation plans that were implemented between 1961 and 1985. The degree of heterogeneity within these districts is immediately apparent. They are located in every region of the country and range in size from Las Cruces, New Mexico, with barely over 15,000 students attending 23 schools in 1968, to New York City, with more than one million students in 853 schools. The sample includes districts in urban areas of all sizes, suburbs (<i>e.g.,</i> Arlington County, Virginia) and rural areas (<i>e.g.,</i> Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and Raleigh County, West Virginia). It contains 34 countywide districts with central cities (the 11 Florida districts fit this description, plus Clark County, Nevada and others) and a small number of consolidated districts (New Castle County, Delaware and Jefferson County, Kentucky).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"The districts also vary in their racial compositions and levels of segregation. Initial plans were implemented in Mobile, Alabama and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and in a number of other southern districts in the face of total racial segregation. At the other extreme, Santa Clara, California had a relatively even racial distribution prior to its 1979 desegregation plan. When the 1965 plan was designed for Harford County, Maryland, the district was 92 percent white. Compton, California, on the other hand, became over 99 percent black in the 1980s, while Buffalo, New York had a virtual 50-50 split between white and minority students prior to its 1977 plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"It is not surprising to find a large number of different desegregation strategies in a sample with this much variation.\" Welch 23 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p>A majority of these desegregation techniques explicitly considered a student's race. See <i>id.,</i> at 24-28. Transfer plans, for example, allowed students to shift from a school in which they were in the racial majority to a school in which they would be in a racial minority. Some districts, such as Richmond, California, and Buffalo, New York, permitted only \"one-way\" transfers, in which only black students attending predominantly black schools were permitted to transfer to designated receiver schools. <i>Id.,</i> at 25. Fifty-three of the 125 studied districts used transfers as a component of their plans. <i>Id.,</i> at 83-91.</p>\n<p>At the state level, 46 States and Puerto Rico have adopted policies that encourage or require local school districts to enact interdistrict or intradistrict open choice plans. Eight of those States condition approval of transfers to another school or district on whether the transfer will produce increased racial integration. Eleven other States require local boards to deny transfers that are not in compliance with the local school board's desegregation plans. See Education Commission of the States, Open Enrollment: 50-State Report (2007), online at http://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=268.</p>\n<p>Arkansas, for example, provides by statute that \"[n]o student may transfer to a nonresident district where the percentage of enrollment for the student's race exceeds that percentage in the student's resident district.\" Ark. Code Ann. §6-18-206(f)(1), as amended 2007 Ark. Gen. Acts 552 (2007). An Ohio statute provides, in respect to student choice, that each school district must establish \"[p]rocedures to ensure that an appropriate racial balance is maintained in the district schools.\" Ohio Rev. Code Ann. §3313.98(B)(2)(b)(iii) (Lexis Supp. 2006). Ohio adds that a \"district may object to the enrollment of a native student in an adjacent or other district in order to maintain an appropriate racial balance.\" §3313.98 (F)(1)(a).</p>\n<p>A Connecticut statute states that its student choice program will seek to \"preserve racial and ethnic balance.\" Conn. Gen. Stat. §10-266aa(b)(2) (2007). Connecticut law requires each school district to submit racial group population figures to the State Board of Education. §10-226a. Another Connecticut regulation provides that \"[a]ny school in which the Proportion for the School falls outside of a range from 25 percentage points less to 25 percentage points more than the Comparable Proportion for the School District, shall be determined to be racially imbalanced.\" Conn. Agencies Regs. §10-226e-3(b) (1999). A \"racial imbalance\" determination requires the district to submit a plan to correct the racial imbalance, which plan may include \"mandatory pupil reassignment.\" §§10-226e-5(a) and (c)(4).</p>\n<p>Interpreting that State's Constitution, the Connecticut Supreme Court has held legally inadequate the reliance by a local school district solely upon some of the techniques JUSTICE KENNEDY today recommends (<i>e.g.,</i> reallocating resources, etc.). See <i>Sheff</i> v. <i>O'Neill,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></span> (1996). The State Supreme Court wrote: \"Despite the initiatives undertaken by the defendants to alleviate the severe racial and ethnic disparities among school districts, and despite the fact that the defendants did not intend to create or maintain these disparities, the disparities that continue to burden the education of the plaintiffs infringe upon their fundamental state constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 42, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 1289.</p>\n<p>At a minimum, the plurality's views would threaten a surge of race-based litigation. Hundreds of state and federal statutes and regulations use racial classifications for educational or other purposes. See <i>supra,</i> at 27. In many such instances, the contentious force of legal challenges to these classifications, meritorious or not, would displace earlier calm.</p>\n<p>The wide variety of different integration plans that school districts use throughout the Nation suggests that the problem of racial segregation in schools, including <i>de facto</i> segregation, is difficult to solve. The fact that many such plans have used explicitly racial criteria suggests that such criteria have an important, sometimes necessary, role to play. The fact that the controlling opinion would make a school district's use of such criteria often unlawful (and the plurality's \"colorblind\" view would make such use always unlawful) suggests that today's opinion will require setting aside the laws of several States and many local communities.</p>\n<p>As I have pointed out, <i>supra,</i> at 4, <i>de facto</i> resegregation is on the rise. See Appendix A, <i>infra.</i> It is reasonable to conclude that such resegregation can create serious educational, social, and civic problems. See <i>supra,</i> at 37-45. Given the conditions in which school boards work to set policy, see <i>supra,</i> at 20-21, they may need all of the means presently at their disposal to combat those problems. Yet the plurality would deprive them of at least one tool that some districts now consider vitalthe limited use of broad race-conscious student population ranges.</p>\n<p>I use the words \"may need\" here deliberately. The plurality, or at least those who follow JUSTICE THOMAS' \"`color-blind'\" approach, see <i>ante,</i> at 26-27 (THOMAS, J., concurring); <i>Grutter,</i> 539 U. S., at 353-354 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), may feel confident that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end <i>all</i> governmental use of race-conscious criteria including those with inclusive objectives. See <i>ante,</i> at 40-41 (plurality opinion); see also <i>ante,</i> at 26 (THOMAS, J., concurring). By way of contrast, I do not claim to know how best to stop harmful discrimination; how best to create a society that includes all Americans; how best to overcome our serious problems of increasing <i>de facto</i> segregation, troubled inner city schooling, and poverty correlated with race. But, as a judge, I do know that the Constitution does not authorize judges to dictate solutions to these problems. Rather, the Constitution creates a democratic political system through which the people themselves must together find answers. And it is for them to debate how best to educate the Nation's children and how best to administer America's schools to achieve that aim. The Court should leave them to their work. And it is for them to decide, to quote the plurality's slogan, whether the best \"way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 40-41. See also <i>Parents Involved VII,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span>, at 1222 (Bea, J., dissenting) (\"The way to end racial discrimination is to stop discriminating by race\"). That is why the Equal Protection Clause outlaws invidious discrimination, but does not similarly forbid all use of race-conscious criteria.</p>\n<p>Until today, this Court understood the Constitution as affording the people, acting through their elected representatives, freedom to select the use of \"race-conscious\" criteria from among their available options. See <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.,</i> 515 U. S., at 237 (\"[S]trict scrutiny\" in this context is \"[not] `strict in theory, but fatal in fact' \" (quoting <i>Fullilove,</i> 448 U. S., at 519 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment))). Today, however, the Court restricts (and some Members would eliminate) that leeway. I fear the consequences of doing so for the law, for the schools, for the democratic process, and for America's efforts to create, out of its diversity, one Nation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>Conclusions</i></h2>\n<p>To show that the school assignment plans here meet the requirements of the Constitution, I have written at exceptional length. But that length is necessary. I cannot refer to the history of the plans in these cases to justify the use of race-conscious criteria without describing that history in full. I cannot rely upon <i>Swann</i>'s statement that the use of race-conscious limits is permissible without showing, rather than simply asserting, that the statement represents a constitutional principle firmly rooted in federal and state law. Nor can I explain my disagreement with the Court's holding and the plurality's opinion, without offering a detailed account of the arguments they propound and the consequences they risk.</p>\n<p>Thus, the opinion's reasoning is long. But its conclusion is short: The plans before us satisfy the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause. And it is the plurality's opinion, not this dissent that \"fails to ground the result it would reach in law.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 28.</p>\n<p>Four basic considerations have led me to this view. <i>First,</i> the histories of Louisville and Seattle reveal complex circumstances and a long tradition of conscientious efforts by local school boards to resist racial segregation in public schools. Segregation at the time of <i>Brown</i> gave way to expansive remedies that included busing, which in turn gave rise to fears of white flight and resegregation. For decades now, these school boards have considered and adopted and revised assignment plans that sought to rely less upon race, to emphasize greater student choice, and to improve the conditions of all schools for all students, no matter the color of their skin, no matter where they happen to reside. The plans under reviewwhich are less burdensome, more egalitarian, and more effective than prior planscontinue in that tradition. And their history reveals school district goals whose remedial, educational, and democratic elements are inextricably intertwined each with the others. See Part I, <i>supra,</i> at 2-21.</p>\n<p><i>Second,</i> since this Court's decision in <i>Brown,</i> the law has consistently and unequivocally approved of both voluntary and compulsory race-conscious measures to combat segregated schools. The Equal Protection Clause, ratified following the Civil War, has always distinguished in practice between state action that excludes and thereby subordinates racial minorities and state action that seeks to bring together people of all races. From <i>Swann</i> to <i>Grutter,</i> this Court's decisions have emphasized this distinction, recognizing that the fate of race relations in this country depends upon unity among our children, \"for unless our children begin to learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to live together.\" <i>Milliken,</i> 418 U. S., at 783 (Marshall, J., dissenting). See also C. Sumner, Equality Before the Law: Unconstitutionality of Separate Colored Schools in Massachusetts, in 2 The Works of Charles Sumner 327, 371 (1849) (\"The law contemplates not only that all be taught, but that all shall be taught together\"). See Part II, <i>supra,</i> at 21-37.</p>\n<p><i>Third,</i> the plans before us, subjected to rigorous judicial review, are supported by compelling state interests and are narrowly tailored to accomplish those goals. Just as diversity in higher education was deemed compelling in <i>Grutter,</i> diversity in public primary and secondary schoolswhere there is even more to gainmust be, <i>a fortiori,</i> a compelling state interest. Even apart from <i>Grutter,</i> five Members of this Court agree that \"avoiding racial isolation\" and \"achiev[ing] a diverse student population\" remain today compelling interests. <i>Ante,</i> at 17-18 (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). These interests combine remedial, educational, and democratic objectives. For the reasons discussed above, however, I disagree with JUSTICE</p>\n<p>KENNEDY that Seattle and Louisville have not done enough to demonstrate that their present plans are necessary to continue upon the path set by <i>Brown.</i> These plans are <i>more</i> \"narrowly tailored\" than the race-conscious law school admissions criteria at issue in <i>Grutter.</i> Hence, their lawfulness follows <i>a fortiori</i> from this Court's prior decisions. See Parts III-IV, <i>supra,</i> at 37-57.</p>\n<p><i>Fourth,</i> the plurality's approach risks serious harm to the law and for the Nation. Its view of the law rests either upon a denial of the distinction between exclusionary and inclusive use of race-conscious criteria in the context of the Equal Protection Clause, or upon such a rigid application of its \"test\" that the distinction loses practical significance. Consequently, the Court's decision today slows down and sets back the work of local school boards to bring about racially diverse schools. See Part V, <i>supra,</i> at 57-63.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the consequences of the approach the Court takes today are serious. Yesterday, the plans under review were lawful. Today, they are not. Yesterday, the citizens of this Nation could look for guidance to this Court's unanimous pronouncements concerning desegregation. Today, they cannot. Yesterday, school boards had available to them a full range of means to combat segregated schools. Today, they do not.</p>\n<p>The Court's decision undermines other basic institutional principles as well. What has happened to <i>stare decisis?</i> The history of the plans before us, their educational importance, their highly limited use of raceall these and moremake clear that the compelling interest here is stronger than in <i>Grutter.</i> The plans here are more narrowly tailored than the law school admissions program there at issue. Hence, applying <i>Grutter</i>'s strict test, their lawfulness follows <i>a fortiori.</i> To hold to the contrary is to transform that test from \"strict\" to \"fatal in fact\"the very opposite of what <i>Grutter</i> said. And what has happened to <i>Swann?</i> To <i>McDaniel?</i> To <i>Crawford?</i> To <i>Harris?</i> To <i>School Committee of Boston?</i> To <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1?</i> After decades of vibrant life, they would all, under the plurality's logic, be written out of the law.</p>\n<p>And what of respect for democratic local decisionmaking by States and school boards? For several decades this Court has rested its public school decisions upon <i>Swann</i>'s basic view that the Constitution grants local school districts a significant degree of leeway where the inclusive use of race-conscious criteria is at issue. Now localities will have to cope with the difficult problems they face (including resegregation) deprived of one means they may find necessary.</p>\n<p>And what of law's concern to diminish and peacefully settle conflict among the Nation's people? Instead of accommodating different good-faith visions of our country and our Constitution, today's holding upsets settled expectations, creates legal uncertainty, and threatens to produce considerable further litigation, aggravating racerelated conflict.</p>\n<p>And what of the long history and moral vision that the Fourteenth Amendment itself embodies? The plurality cites in support those who argued in <i>Brown</i> against segregation, and JUSTICE THOMAS likens the approach that I have taken to that of segregation's defenders. See <i>ante,</i> at 39-41 (plurality opinion) (comparing Jim Crow segregation to Seattle and Louisville's integration polices); <i>ante,</i> at 28-32 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But segregation policies did not simply tell schoolchildren \"where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin,\" <i>ante,</i> at 40 (plurality opinion); they perpetuated a caste system rooted in the institutions of slavery and 80 years of legalized subordination. The lesson of history, see <i>ante,</i> at 39 (plurality opinion), is not that efforts to continue racial segregation are constitutionally indistinguishable from efforts to achieve racial integration. Indeed, it is a cruel distortion of history to compare Topeka, Kansas, in the 1950's to Louisville and Seattle in the modern dayto equate the plight of Linda Brown (who was ordered to attend a Jim Crow school) to the circumstances of Joshua McDonald (whose request to transfer to a school closer to home was initially declined). This is not to deny that there is a cost in applying \"a state-mandated racial label.\" <i>Ante,</i> at 17 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). But that cost does not approach, in degree or in kind, the terrible harms of slavery, the resulting caste system, and 80 years of legal racial segregation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<p>Finally, what of the hope and promise of <i>Brown?</i> For much of this Nation's history, the races remained divided. It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court's finest hour, <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> challenged this history and helped to change it. For <i>Brown</i> held out a promise. It was a promise embodied in three Amendments designed to make citizens of slaves. It was the promise of true racial equalitynot as a matter of fine words on paper, but as a matter of everyday life in the Nation's cities and schools. It was about the nature of a democracy that must work for all Americans. It sought one law, one Nation, one people, not simply as a matter of legal principle but in terms of how we actually live.</p>\n<p>Not everyone welcomed this Court's decision in <i>Brown.</i> Three years after that decision was handed down, the Governor of Arkansas ordered state militia to block the doors of a white schoolhouse so that black children could not enter. The President of the United States dispatched the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas, and federal troops were needed to enforce a desegregation decree. See <i>Cooper</i> v. <i>Aaron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105766\"><a href=\"/opinion/105766/cooper-v-aaron/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1958). Today, almost 50 years later, attitudes toward race in this Nation have changed dramatically. Many parents, white and black alike, want their children to attend schools with children of different races. Indeed, the very school districts that once spurned integration now strive for it. The long history of their efforts reveals the complexities and difficulties they have faced. And in light of those challenges, they have asked us not to take from their hands the instruments they have used to rid their schools of racial segregation, instruments that they believe are needed to overcome the problems of cities divided by race and poverty. The plurality would decline their modest request.</p>\n<p>The plurality is wrong to do so. The last half-century has witnessed great strides toward racial equality, but we have not yet realized the promise of <i>Brown.</i> To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of <i>Brown.</i> The plurality's position, I fear, would break that promise. This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.</p>\n<p>I must dissent.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF BREYER, J. </h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Resegregation Trends</h2>\n<p>Percentage of Black Students in 90-100 Percent Nonwhite and Majority Nonwhite Public Schools by Region, 1950-1954 to 2000, Fall Enrollment</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\n _________________________________________________________________________________________\n|            | 1950- | 1960-|       |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Region     | 1954  | 1961 | 1968  | 1972   | 1976   | 1980   |  1989  |  1999  |  2000  |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                     Percentage in 90-100% Nonwhite Schools                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Northeast  |  -   |   40  |  42.7 |  46.9  |  51.4  |  48.7  |  49.8  |  50.2  |  51.2  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Border     | 100  |   59  |  60.2 |  54.7  |  42.5  |  37.0  |  33.7  |  39.7  |  39.6  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| South      | 100  |  100  |  77.8 |  24.7  |  22.4  |  23.0  |  26.0  |  31.1  |  30.9  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Midwest    |  53  |   56  |  58.0 |  57.4  |  51.1  |  43.6  |  40.1  |  45.0  |  46.3  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| West       |  -   |   27  |  50.8 |  42.7  |  36.3  |  33.7  |  26.7  |  29.9  |  29.5  |\n|------------|------|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| U.

This litigation was commenced in July 2000, and the record in the District Court was closed before assignments for the 2001-2002 school year were made. See Brief for Respondents in No. 05-908, p. 9, n. 9. We rely, as did the lower courts, largely on data from the 2000-2001 school year in evaluating the plan. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792253\"><a href=\"/opinion/792253/parents-involved-in-community-schools-a-washington-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></a></span>, 1169-1171 (CA9 2005) (en banc) (<i>Parents Involved VII</i>).</p>\n<p>[2]  The racial breakdown of this nonwhite group is approximately 23.8 percent Asian-American, 23.1 percent African-American, 10.3 percent Latino, and 2.8 percent Native-American. See <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787176\"><a href=\"/opinion/787176/parents-involved-in-community-schools-a-washington-nonprofit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">949</span></a></span>, 1005-1006 (CA9 2004) (<i>Parents Involved VI</i>) (Graber, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[3]  For the 2001-2002 school year, the deviation permitted from the desired racial composition was increased from 10 to 15 percent. App. in No. 05-908, p. 38a. The bulk of the data in the record was collected using the 10 percent band, see n. 1, <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>[4]  \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, §1.</p>\n<p>[5]  \"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race . . . be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 78 Stat. 252, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §2000d.</p>\n<p>[6]  \"The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.\" Wash.

Students may also apply to a magnet school or program, or, at the high school level, take advantage of an open enrollment plan that allows ninth-grade students to apply for admission to any nonmagnet high school. App. in No. 05-915, pp. 39-41, 82-83.</p>\n<p>[8]  It is not clear why the racial guidelines were even applied to Joshua's transfer applicationthe guidelines supposedly do not apply at the kindergarten level. <i>Id.,</i> at 43. Neither party disputes, however, that Joshua's transfer application was denied under the racial guidelines, and Meredith's objection is not that the guidelines were misapplied but rather that race was used at all.</p>\n<p>[9]  Meredith joined a pending lawsuit filed by several other plaintiffs. See <i>id.,</i> at 7-11. The other plaintiffs all challenged assignments to certain specialized schools, and the District Court found these assignments, which are no longer at issue in this case, unconstitutional. <i>McFarland I,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2314284\"><a href=\"/opinion/2314284/mcfarland-v-jefferson-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></a></span>, 837, 864 (WD Ky. 2004).</p>\n<p>[10]  The districts point to dicta in a prior opinion in which the Court suggested that, while not constitutionally mandated, it would be constitutionally permissible for a school district to seek racially balanced schools as a matter of \"educational policy.\" See <i>Swann</i> v. <i>Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1971). The districts also quote with approval an in-chambers opinion in which then-Justice Rehnquist made a suggestion to the same effect. See <i>Bustop, Inc.</i> v. <i>Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110010\"><a href=\"/opinion/110010/bustop-inc-applicant-v-the-board-of-education-of-the-city-of-los/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1380</span></a></span>, 1383 (1978). The citations do not carry the significance the districts would ascribe to them. <i>Swann,</i> evaluating a school district engaged in court-ordered desegregation, had no occasion to consider whether a district's voluntary adoption of race-based assignments in the absence of a finding of prior <i>de jure</i> segregation was constitutionally permissible, an issue that was again expressly reserved in <i>Washington</i> v. <i>Seattle School Dist. No. 1,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 472, n. 15 (1982). <i>Bustop,</i> addressing in the context of an emergency injunction application a busing plan imposed by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, is similarly unavailing. Then-Justice Rehnquist, in denying emergency relief, stressed that \"equitable consideration[s]\" counseled against preliminary relief. 439 U. S., at 1383. The propriety of preliminary relief and resolution of the merits are of course \"significantly different\" issues. <i>University of Texas</i> v. <i>Camenisch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110470\"><a href=\"/opinion/110470/university-of-texas-v-camenisch/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span>, 393 (1981).</p>\n<p>[11]  The way Seattle classifies its students bears this out. Upon enrolling their child with the district, parents are required to identify their child as a member of a particular racial group. If a parent identifies more than one race on the form, \"[t]he application will not be accepted and, if necessary, the enrollment service person taking the application will indicate one box.\" App. in No. 05-908, at 303a.</p>\n<p>[12]  Jefferson County also argues that it would be incongruous to hold that what was constitutionally required of it one dayrace-based assignments pursuant to the desegregation decreecan be constitutionally prohibited the next. But what was constitutionally required of the district prior to 2000 was the elimination of the vestiges of prior segregationnot racial proportionality in its own right. See <i>Freeman </i> v. <i>Pitts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112718\"><a href=\"/opinion/112718/freeman-v-pitts/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 494-496 (1992). Once those vestiges were eliminated, Jefferson County was on the same footing as any other school district, and its use of race must be justified on other grounds.</p>\n<p>[13]  Data for the Seattle schools in the several years since this litigation was commenced further demonstrate the minimal role that the racial tiebreaker in fact played. At Ballard, in 2005-2006-when no class at the school was subject to the racial tiebreakerthe student body was 14.2 percent Asian-American, 9 percent African-American, 11.7 percent Latino, 62.3 percent Caucasian, and 2.8 percent Native-American. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-908, p. 7. In 2000-2001, when the racial tiebreaker was last used, Ballard's total enrollment was 17.5 percent Asian-American, 10.8 percent African-American, 10.7 percent Latino, 56.4 percent Caucasian, and 4.6 percent Native-American. App. in No. 05-908, at 283a. Franklin in 2005-2006 was 48.9 percent Asian-American, 33.5 percent African-American, 6.6 percent Latino, 10.2 percent Caucasian, and 0.8 percent Native-American. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-908, at 7. With the racial tiebreaker in 2000-2001, total enrollment was 36.8 percent Asian-American, 32.2 percent African-American, 5.2 percent Latino, 25.1 percent Caucasian, and 0.7 percent Native-American. App. in No. 05-908, at 284a. Nathan Hale's 2005-2006 enrollment was 17.3 percent Asian-American, 10.7 percent African-American, 8 percent Latino, 61.5 percent Caucasian, and 2.5 percent Native-American. Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 05-908, at 7. In 2000-2001, with the racial tiebreaker, it was 17.9 percent AsianA-merican, 13.3 percent African-American, 7 percent Latino, 58.4 percent Caucasian, and 3.4 percent Native-American. App. in No. 05-908, at 286a.</p>\n<p>[14]  In contrast, Seattle's website formerly described \"emphasizing individualism as opposed to a more collective ideology\" as a form of \"cultural racism,\" and currently states that the district has no intention \"to hold onto unsuccessful concepts such as [a] . . . colorblind mentality.\" Harrell, School Web Site Removed: Examples of Racism Sparked Controversy, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 2, 2006, pp. B1, B5. Compare <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting) (\"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law\").</p>\n<p>[15]  JUSTICE BREYER makes much of the fact that in 1978 Seattle \"settled\" an NAACP complaint alleging illegal segregation with the federal Office for Civil Rights (OCR). See <i>post,</i> at 5, 8-9, 18, 23. The memorandum of agreement between Seattle and OCR, of course, contains no admission by Seattle that such segregation ever existed or was ongoing at the time of the agreement, and simply reflects a \"desire to avoid the incovenience [<i>sic</i>] and expense of a formal OCR investigation,\" which OCR was obligated under law to initiate upon the filing of such a complaint. Memorandum of Agreement between Seattle School District No. 1 of King County, Washington, and the Office for Civil Rights, United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 2 (June 9, 11978); see also 45 CFR §80.7(c) (2006).</p>\n<p>[16]  In fact, all the cases JUSTICE BREYER's dissent cites as evidence of the \"prevailing legal assumption,\" see <i>post,</i> at 25-27, were decided before this Court definitively determined that \"all racial classifications. . . must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\" <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 227 (1995). Many proceeded under the now-rejected view that classifications seeking to benefit a disadvantaged racial group should be held to a lesser standard of review. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Springfield School Comm.</i> v. <i>Barksdale,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"268588\"><a href=\"/opinion/268588/springfield-school-committee-v-abraham-barksdale-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, 266 (CA1 1965). Even if this purported distinction, which JUSTICE STEVENS would adopt, <i>post,</i> at 2, n. 3 (dissenting opinion), had not been already rejected by this Court, the distinction has no relevance to these cases, in which students of all races are excluded from the schools they wish to attend based solely on the racial classifications. See, <i>e.g.,</i> App. in No. 05-908, at 202a (noting that 89 nonwhite students were denied assignment to a particular school by operation of Seattle's racial tiebreaker).\n</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS's reliance on <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233892\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233892/school-committee-of-boston-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233892\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233892/school-committee-of-boston-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span> (1967), appeal dism'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></span> (1968) <i>(per curiam)</i><i>, post,</i> at 3-5, is inapposite for the same reason that many of the cases cited by JUSTICE BREYER are inapposite; the case involved a Massachusetts law that required school districts to avoid racial imbalance in schools but did not specify how to achieve this goaland certainly did not require express racial classifications as the means to do so. The law was upheld under rational-basis review, with the state court explicitly rejecting the suggestionwhich is now plainly the lawthat \"racial group classifications bear a far heavier burden of justification.\" 352 Mass., at 700, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 734 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The passage JUSTICE STEVENS quotes proves our point; all the quoted language says is that the school committee \"shall prepare a plan to eliminate the imbalance.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 695, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 731; see <i>post,</i> at 4, n. 5. Nothing in the opinion approves use of racial classifications as the means to address the imbalance. The suggestion that our decision today is somehow inconsistent with our disposition of that appeal is belied by the fact that neither the lower courts, the respondent school districts, nor any of their 51 <i>amici</i> saw fit even to cite the case. We raise this fact not to argue that the dismissal should be afforded any different <i>stare decisis</i> effect, but rather simply to suggest that perhapsfor the reasons noted above the dismissal does not mean what JUSTICE STEVENS believes it does.</p>\n<p>[17]  JUSTICE BREYER also tries to downplay the impact of the racial assignments by stating that in Seattle \"students can decide voluntarily to transfer to a preferred district high school (without any consideration of race-conscious criteria).\" <i>Post,</i> at 46. This presumably refers to the district's decision to cease, for 2001-2002 school year assignments, applying the racial tiebreaker to students seeking to transfer to a different school after ninth grade. See App. in No. 05-908, at 137a-139a. There are obvious disincentives for students to transfer to a different school after a full quarter of their high school experience has passed, and the record sheds no light on how transfers to the oversubscribed high schools are handled.</p>\n<p>[1]  In this Court's paradigmatic segregation cases, there was a local ordinance, state statute, or state constitutional provision requiring racial separation. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Brief for Petitioners in <i>Bolling</i> v. <i>Sharpe,</i> O. T. 1952, No. 4, pp. 28-30 (cataloging state laws requiring separation of the races); <i>id.,</i> at App. A (listing \"Statutory and Constitutional Provisions in the States Where Segregation in Education is Institutionalized\").</p>\n<p>[2]  The dissent refers repeatedly and reverently to \"`integration.' \" However, outside of the context of remediation for past <i>de jure</i> segregation, \"integration\" is simply racial balancing. See <i>post,</i> at 37. There-fore, the school districts' attempts to further \"integrate\" are properly thought of as little more than attempts to achieve a particular racial balance.</p>\n<p>[3]  The dissent's assertion that these plans are necessary for the school districts to maintain their \"hard-won gains\" reveals its conflation of segregation and racial imbalance. <i>Post,</i> at 38. For the dissent's purposes, the relevant hard-won gains are the present racial compositions in the individual schools in Seattle and Louisville. However, the actual hard-won gain in these cases is the elimination of the vestiges of the system of state-enforced racial separation that once existed in Louisville. To equate the achievement of a certain statistical mix in several schools with the elimination of the system of systematic <i>de jure</i> segregation trivializes the latter accomplishment. Nothing but an interest in classroom aesthetics and a hypersensitivity to elite sensibilities justifies the school districts' racial balancing programs. See Part II-B, <i>infra.</i> But \"the principle of inherent equality that underlies and infuses our Constitution\" required the disestablishment of <i>de jure</i> segregation. See <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 240 (1995) (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Assessed in any objective manner, there is no comparison between the two.</p>\n<p>[4]  The dissent makes much of the supposed difficulty of determining whether prior segregation was <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto.</i> See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 19-20. That determination typically will not be nearly as difficult as the dissent makes it seem. In most cases, there either will or will not have been a state constitutional amendment, state statute, local ordinance, or local administrative policy explicitly requiring separation of the races. See, <i>e.g.,</i> n. 1, <i>supra.</i> And even if the determination is difficult, it is one the dissent acknowledges must be made to determine what remedies school districts are required to adopt. <i>Post,</i> at 43.</p>\n<p>[5]  This Court's opinion in <i>McDaniel</i> v. <i>Barresi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108318\"><a href=\"/opinion/108318/mcdaniel-v-barresi/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span> (1971), fits comfortably within this framework. There, a Georgia school board voluntarily adopted a desegregation plan. At the time of <i>Brown,</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span> (1954), Georgia's Constitution required that \"[s]eparate schools shall be provided for the white and colored races.\" Ga. Const., Art. VII, §1, ch. 2-6401 (1948). Given that state law had previously required the school board to maintain a dual school system, the county was obligated to take measures to remedy its prior <i>de jure</i> segregation. This Court recognized as much in its opinion, which stated that the school board had an \"affirmative duty to dis-establish the dual school system.\" <i>McDaniel, supra,</i> at 41.</p>\n<p>[6]  As I have explained elsewhere, the remedies this Court authorized lower courts to compel in early desegregation cases like <i>Green</i> and <i>Swann</i> were exceptional. See <i>Missouri</i> v. <i>Jenkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117944\"><a href=\"/opinion/117944/missouri-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span>, 124-125 (1995), (THOMAS, J., concurring). Sustained resistance to <i>Brown</i> prompted the Court to authorize extraordinary race-conscious remedial measures (like compelled racial mixing) to turn the Constitution's dictate to desegregate into reality. 515 U. S., at 125 (THOMAS, J., concurring). Even if these measures were appropriate as remedies in the face of widespread resistance to <i>Brown</i>'s mandate, they are not forever insulated from constitutional scrutiny. Rather, \"such powers should have been temporary and used only to overcome the widespread resistance to the dictates of the Constitution.\" 515 U. S., at 125 (THOMAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>[7]  Though the dissent cites every manner of complaint, record material, and scholarly article relating to Seattle's race-based student assignment efforts, <i>post,</i> at 73-75, it cites no law or official policy that required separation of the races in Seattle's schools. Nevertheless, the dissent tries to cast doubt on the historical fact that the Seattle schools were never segregated by law by citing allegations that the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other organizations made in court filings to the effect that Seattle's schools were once segregated by law. See <i>post,</i> at 7-9, 23. These allegations were never proved and were not even made in this case. Indeed, the record before us suggests the contrary. See App. in No. 05-908, pp. 214a, 225a, 257a. Past allegations in another case provide no basis for resolving these cases.</p>\n<p>[8]  Contrary to the dissent's argument, <i>post,</i> at 44, the Louisville school district's interest in remedying its past <i>de jure</i> segregation did vanish the day the District Court found that Louisville had eliminated the vestiges of its historic <i>de jure</i> segregation. See <i>Hampton</i> v. <i>Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419867\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419867/hampton-v-jefferson-county-bd-of-educ/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, at 360 (WD Ky. 2000). If there were further remediation to be done, the District Court could not logically have reached the conclusion that Louisville \"ha[d] eliminated the vestiges associated with the former policy of segregation and its pernicious effects.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Because Louisville could use race-based measures only as a remedy for past <i>de jure</i> segregation, it is not \"incoherent,\" <i>post,</i> at 56, to say that race-based decisionmaking was allowed to Louisville one daywhile it was still remedyingand forbidden to it the nextwhen remediation was finished. That seemingly odd turnaround is merely a result of the fact that the remediation of <i>de jure</i> segregation is a jealously guarded exception to the Equal Protection Clause's general rule against government race-based decisionmaking.</p>\n<p>[9]  The dissent's appeal to <i>stare decisis, post,</i> at 65, is particularly ironic in light of its apparent willingness to depart from these precedents, <i>post,</i> at 36-37.</p>\n<p>[10]  The idea that government racial classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny did not originate in <i>Adarand.</i> As early as <i>Loving</i> v. <i>Virginia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1967), this Court made clear that government action that \"rest[s] solely upon distinctions drawn according to race\" had to be \"subjected to the `most rigid scrutiny.'\" <i>Id.,</i> at 11 (quoting <i>Korematsu</i> v. <i>United States,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span>, 216 (1944)); see also <i>McLaughlin</i> v. <i>Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106945\"><a href=\"/opinion/106945/mclaughlin-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 196 (1964) (requiring a statute drawing a racial classification to be \"necessary, and not merely rationally related, to accomplishment of a permissible state policy\"); <i>id.,</i> at 197 (Harlan, J., concurring) (\"The necessity test . . . should be equally applicable in a case involving state racial discrimination\").</p>\n<p>[11]  At least one of the academic articles the dissent cites to support this proposition fails to establish a causal connection between the supposed educational gains realized by black students and racial mixing. See Hallinan, Diversity Effects on Student Outcomes: Social Science Evidence, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span>. J. 733 (1998). In the pages following the ones the dissent cites, the author of that article remarks that \"the main reason white and minority students perform better academically in majority white schools is likely that these schools provide greater opportunities to learn. In other words, it is not desegregation per se that improves achievement, but rather the learning advantages some desegregated schools provide.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 744. Evidence that race is a good proxy for other factors that might be correlated with educational benefits does not support a compelling interest in the use of race to achieve academic results.</p>\n<p>[12]  Of course, if the Seattle school board were truly committed to the notion that diversity leads directly to educational benefits, operating a school with such a high \"nonwhite\" enrollment would be a shocking dereliction of its duty to educate the students enrolled in that school.</p>\n<p>[13]  In fact, the available data from the Seattle school district appear to undercut the dissent's view. A comparison of the test results of the schools in the last year the racial balancing program operated to the results in the 2004-to-2005 school year (in which student assignments were race-neutral) does not indicate the decline in black achievement one would expect to find if black achievement were contingent upon a particular racial mix. See Washington State Report Card, online at http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/summary.aspx?schoolId= 1099&amp;OrgType=4&amp;reportLevel=School; http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/ summary.aspx?schoolId=1104&amp;reportLevel=School&amp;orgLinkId=1104&amp;yrs=; http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/summary.aspx?schoolId=1061&amp;report Level=School&amp;orgLinkId=1061&amp;yrs=; http://reportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us/ summary.aspx?schoolId=1043&amp;reportLevel=School&amp;orgLinkId=1043&amp; yrs= (showing that reading scores went up, not down, when Seattle's race-based assignment program ended at Sealth High School, Ingraham High School, and Franklin High Schoolsome of the schools most affected by the plan).</p>\n<p>[14]  The dissent accuses me of \"feel[ing] confident that, to end invidious discrimination, one must end <i>all</i> governmental use of race-conscious criteria\" and chastises me for not deferring to democratically elected majorities. See <i>post,</i> at 62. Regardless of what JUSTICE BREYER's goals might be, this Court does not sit to \"create a society that includes all Americans\" or to solve the problems of \"troubled inner city schooling.\" <i>Ibid.</i> We are not social engineers. The United States Constitution dictates that local governments cannot make decisions on the basis of race. Consequently, regardless of the perceived negative effects of racial imbalance, I will not defer to legislative majorities where the Constitution forbids it.\n</p>\n<p>It should escape no one that behind JUSTICE BREYER's veil of judicial modesty hides an inflated role for the Federal Judiciary. The dissent's approach confers on judges the power to say what sorts of discrimination are benign and which are invidious. Having made that determination (based on no objective measure that I can detect), a judge following the dissent's approach will set the level of scrutiny to achieve the desired result. Only then must the judge defer to a democratic majority. In my view, to defer to one's preferred result is not to defer at all.</p>\n<p>[15]  The notion that a \"democratic\" interest qualifies as a compelling interest (or constitutes a part of a compelling interest) is proposed for the first time in today's dissent and has little basis in the Constitution or our precedent, which has narrowly restricted the interests that qualify as compelling. See <i>Grutter</i> v. <i>Bollinger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span>, 351-354 (2003) (in part and dissenting in part). The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact the dissent's newly minted understanding of liberty. See <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96276\"><a href=\"/opinion/96276/lochner-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting) (\"The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer's Social Statics\").</p>\n<p>[16]  The dissent does not explain how its recognition of an interest in teaching racial understanding and cooperation here is consistent with the Court's rejection of a similar interest in <i>Wygant.</i> In <i>Wygant,</i> a school district justified its race-based teacher-layoff program in part on the theory that \"minority teachers provided `role models' for minority students and that a racially `diverse' faculty would improve the education of all students.\" <i>Grutter, supra,</i> at 352 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (citing Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1984, No. 84-1340, pp. 27-28; 476 U. S., at 315 (STEVENS, J., dissenting)). The Court rejected the interests asserted to justify the layoff program as insufficiently compelling. <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 275-276 (plurality opinion); <i>id.,</i> at 295 (White, J., concurring in judgment). If a school district has an interest in teaching racial understanding and cooperation, there is no logical reason why that interest should not extend to the composition of the teaching staff as well as the composition of the student body. The dissent's reliance on this interest is, therefore, inconsistent with <i>Wygant.</i></p>\n<p>[17]  Outside the school context, this Court's cases reflect the fact that racial mixing does not always lead to harmony and understanding. In <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span> (2005), this Court considered a California prison policy that separated inmates racially. <i>Id.,</i> at 525-528 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). That policy was necessary because of \"numerous incidents of racial violence.\" <i>Id.,</i> at 502; <i>id.,</i> at 532-534 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). As a result of this Court's insistence on strict scrutiny of that policy, but see <i>id.,</i> at 538-547, inmates in the California prisons were killed. See <i>Beard</i> v. <i>Banks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145626\"><a href=\"/opinion/145626/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></a></span>___, ___ (2006) (THOMAS, J., concuring in judgment) (noting that two were killed and hundreds were injured in race rioting subsequent to this Court's decision in <i>Johnson</i>).</p>\n<p>[18]  After discussing the \"democratic element,\" the dissent repeats its assertion that the social science evidence supporting that interest is \"sufficiently strong to permit a school board to determine . . . that this interest is compelling.\" <i>Post,</i> at 40. Again, though, the school boards have no say in deciding whether an interest is compelling. Strict scrutiny of race-based government decisionmaking is more searching than <i>Chevron</i>-style administrative review for reasonableness. See <i>Chevron U. S. A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 845 (1984).</p>\n<p>[19]  The dissent half-heartedly attacks the historical underpinnings of the color-blind Constitution. <i>Post,</i> at 28-29. I have no quarrel with the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment sought to bring former slaves into American society as full members. <i>Post,</i> at 28 (citing <i>Slaughter-House Cases,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wall.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></span>, 71-72 (1873)). What the dissent fails to understand, however, is that the color-blind Constitution does not bar the government from taking measures to remedy past state  sponsored discriminationindeed, it requires that such measures be taken in certain circumstances. See, <i>e.g.,</i> Part IB, <i>supra.</i> Race-based government measures during the 1860's and 1870's to remedy <i>state  enforced slavery</i> were therefore not inconsistent with the color-blind Constitution.</p>\n<p>[20]  See also Juris.

Indeed, the racial theories endorsed by the Seattle school board should cause the dissenters to question whether local school boards should be entrusted with the power to make decisions on the basis of race. The Seattle school district's Website formerly contained the following definition of \"cultural racism\": \"Those aspects of society that overtly and covertly attribute value and normality to white people and whiteness, and devalue, stereotype, and label people of color as `other,' different, less than, or render them invisible.

White Privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools, and blank checks.\" See White Privilege Conference, Questions and Answers, http://www.uccs.edu/~wpc/ faqs.htm; see generally Westneat, School District's Obsessed with Race, Seattle Times, Apr. 1, 2007, p. B1 (describing racial issues in Seattle schools).</p>\n<p>[1]  Le Lys Rouge (The Red Lily) 95 (W. Stephens transl. 6th ed. 1922).</p>\n<p>[2]  See, <i>e.g.,</i> J. Wilkinson, From <i>Brown</i> to <i>Bakke</i> 11 (1979) (\"Everyone understands that <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education</i> helped deliver the Negro from over three centuries of legal bondage\"); Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L. J. 421, 424-425 (\"History, too, tells us that segregation was imposed on one race by the other race; consent was not invited or required. Segregation in the South grew up and is kept going because and only because the white race has wanted it that wayan incontrovertible fact which itself hardly consorts with equality\").</p>\n<p>[3]  I have long adhered to the view that a decision to exclude a member of a minority because of his race is fundamentally different from a decision to include a member of a minority for that reason. See, <i>e.g., </i><i>Adarand Constructors, Inc.</i> v. <i>Peña,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span>, 243, 248, n. 6 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <i>Wygant</i> v. <i>Jackson Bd. of Ed.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 316 (1986) (same). This distinction is critically important in the context of education. While the focus of our opinions is often on the benefits that minority schoolchildren receive from an integrated education, see, <i>e.g., ante,</i> at 15 (THOMAS, J., concurring), children of <i>all</i> races benefit from integrated classrooms and playgrounds, see <i>Wygant,</i> 476 U. S., at 316 (\"[T]he fact that persons of different races do, indeed, have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons. The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it\").</p>\n<p>[4]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE twice cites my dissent in <i>Fullilove</i> v. <i>Klutznick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110338\"><a href=\"/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span> (1980). See <i>ante,</i> at 12, 23. In that case, I stressed the importance of confining a remedy for <i>past</i> wrongdoing to the members of the injured class. See 448 U. S., at 539. The present cases, unlike <i>Fullilove</i> but like our decision in <i>Wygant,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, require us to \"ask whether the Board[s'] actions[s] advanc[e] the public interest in educating children for the <i>future,</i>\" <i>id.,</i> at 313 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (emphasis added). See <i>ibid.</i> (\"In my opinion, it is not necessary to find that the Board of Education has been guilty of racial discrimination in the past to support the conclusion that it has a legitimate interest in employing more black teachers in the future\"). See also <i>Adarand,</i> 515 U. S., at 261-262 (1995) (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (\"This program, then, if in part a remedy for past discrimination, is most importantly a forward-looking response to practical problems faced by minority subcontractors\").</p>\n<p>[5]  THE CHIEF JUSTICE states that the Massachusetts racial imbalance Act did not require express classifications. See <i>ante,</i> at 31-32, n. 16. This is incorrect. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court expressly stated: \"The racial imbalance act requires the school committee of every municipality annually to submit statistics showing the percentage of nonwhite pupils in all public schools and in each school. Whenever the board finds that racial imbalance exists in a public school, it shall give written notice to the appropriate school committee, which shall prepare a plan to eliminate imbalance and file a copy with the board. `The term \"racial imbalance\" refers to a ratio between nonwhite and other students in public schools which is sharply out of balance with the racial composition of the society in which nonwhite children study, serve and work. For the purpose of this section, racial imbalance shall be deemed to exist when the per cent of nonwhite students in any public school is in excess of fifty per cent of the total number of students in such school.'\" 352 Mass., at 695, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 731.</p>\n<p>[6]  Compare <i>ante,</i> at 39 (\"It was not the inequality of the facilities but the fact of legally separating children on the basis of race on which the Court relied to find a constitutional violation in 1954\"), with Juris. Statement in <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> O. T. 1967, No. 67-759, p. 11 (\"It is implicit in <i>Brown</i> v. <i>Board of Education of Topeka,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105221\"><a href=\"/opinion/105221/brown-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span>, that color or race is a constitutionally impermissible standard for the assignment of school children to public schools. We construe <i>Brown</i> as endorsing Mr. Justice Harlan's classical statement in <i>Plessy</i> v. <i>Ferguson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94508\"><a href=\"/opinion/94508/plessy-v-ferguson/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span>, 539: `Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens' \").</p>\n<p>[7]  In 1968 our mandatory jurisdiction was defined by the provision of the 1948 Judicial Code then codified at <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span>. §1257, see 62 Stat. 929; that provision was repealed in 1988, see 102 Stat. 662.</p>\n<p>[8]  For example, prior to our decision in <i>School Comm. of Boston,</i> the Illinois Supreme Court had issued an unpublished opinion holding unconstitutional a similar statute aimed at eliminating racial imbalance in public schools. See Juris. Statement in <i>School Comm. of Boston</i> v. <i>Board of Education,</i> O. T. 1967, No. 67-759, at 9 (\"Unlike the Massachusetts Court, the Illinois Supreme Court has recently held its law to eliminate racial imbalance unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\"); <i>ibid.,</i> n. 1. However, shortly after we dismissed the Massachusetts suit for want of a substantial federal question, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed course and upheld its statute in the published decision that JUSTICE BREYER extensively quotes in his dissent. See <i>Tometz</i> v. <i>Board of Ed., Waukegan School Dist. No. 6,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092507/tometz-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2092507\"><a href=\"/opinion/2092507/tometz-v-board-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span> (1968). In so doing, the Illinois Supreme Court acted in explicit reliance on our decision in <i>School Comm. of Boston.</i> See <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 599-600, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span>, at 502 (\"Too, the United States Supreme Court on January 15, 1968, dismissed an appeal in School Committee of Boston v.
