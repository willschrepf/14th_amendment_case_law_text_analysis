See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (the Board) seeks enforcement\nof its bargaining order against Beverly Health and Rehabilitative Ser-\nvices, Inc. (Beverly). Beverly asserts that the Board improperly certi-\nfied election results in favor of representation by the Health Care and\nSocial Service Union, SEIU, AFL-CIO (the Union), after modifying\nthe bargaining unit post-election to exclude all licensed practical\nnurses (LPNs). Because the Board's election procedures denied the\nemployees an opportunity to vote for representation in the unit certi-\nfied by the Board, we deny the Board's application for enforcement\nof its order.\n\nI.\n\nBeverly, d/b/a Morgan Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center,\noperates a 100-bed long-term nursing care facility in Morgantown,\nWest Virginia. On June 16, 1992, the Union filed a petition for certifi-\ncation of representation with Region Six of the Board. The petition\nincluded a proposed bargaining unit consisting of all full-time and\nregular part-time service and maintenance employees at the nursing\nhome, including LPNs and nine other job classifications. The petition\n\n                    2\n\fexcluded, among others, all supervisors as defined in § 2(11) of the\nNational Labor Relations Act (the Act).1 See 29 U.S.C. § 152(11).\n\nOn July 13, 1992, a Board hearing officer conducted a representa-\ntion hearing, the primary issue of which was whether the LPNs at the\nBeverly facility were \"supervisors\" within the meaning of § 2(11) of\nthe Act. See id. Beverly argued that the LPNs should be excluded\nfrom the bargaining unit as supervisors. Of the approximately eighty-\ntwo employees in the proposed bargaining unit, sixteen were LPNs.\nThese LPNs had a certain amount of authority over another forty-six\nemployees included in the proposed bargaining unit, including the\nauthority to arrange work schedules and to evaluate the performance\nof these employees.\n\nOn July 31, 1992, the Regional Director for Region Six issued a\ndecision and direction of election in which he found that the LPNs\nwere not supervisors under § 2(11) of the Act. Beverly filed a timely\nrequest for review of the Regional Director's decision, and on August\n27, 1992, the Board denied Beverly's request for review. On that\nsame day, an election was conducted at the Beverly facility. In con-\nducting the election, the Regional Director permitted the LPNs to\nvote, and he did not segregate the ballots of the LPNs from the ballots\nof the other employees. In addition, Beverly was not permitted to\nchallenge the ballots of the LPNs. Of the eighty-two eligible employ-\nees, seventy-five employees voted. Fifty-five employees voted in\nfavor of Union representation, while twenty employees voted against\nUnion representation. Three ballots were challenged. On September\n9, 1992, the Regional Director, noting that no objections to the elec-\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 The unit described on the official notice of election included:\n\n          All full-time and regular part-time service and maintenance\n          employees, including licensed practical nurses, certified nurse's\n          aides, nurse's aides, dietary employees, environmental service\n          employees, medical records coordinator, central supply clerk,\n          physical therapy aides, activities director's assistants and mainte-\n          nance employees employed by [Beverly] at its Morgantown,\n          West Virginia facility; excluding all office clerical employees,\n          registered nurses and guards, professional employees and\n          supervisors as defined in the Act.\n\n(J.A. 21 (emphasis added)).\n\n                    3\n\ftion had been filed, certified the Union as the exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative of the unit employees.\n\nTwo days later, on September 11, 1992, we denied enforcement of\nthe Board's order in a case in which the issue was whether LPNs at\na different health care facility were statutory supervisors under\n§ 2(11) of the Act. See Beverly Calif. Corp. v. NLRB, 1992 WL\n223815 (4th Cir. Sept. 11, 1992) (unpublished opinion). Following\nthis decision, Beverly filed a request for reconsideration of the\nBoard's certification of the election in this case. On May 26, 1993,\nthe Board granted Beverly's request for reconsideration, finding that\nit raised substantial issues warranting review. Almost one year later,\non May 11, 1994, the Board affirmed the Regional Director's decision\nand direction of election.\n\nTwo weeks later, on May 23, 1994, the Supreme Court issued its\ndecision in NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp., 511 U.S. 571\n(1994), in which it rejected the \"patient care analysis\" on which both\nthe Regional Director and the Board had relied in finding that the\nLPNs in this case were employees and not \"supervisors\" under\n§ 2(11) of the Act. In light of this decision, Beverly filed a second\nmotion for reconsideration. On August 4, 1994, the Board granted\nBeverly's motion and remanded the case to the Regional Director for\nreconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nOn October 24, 1994, a hearing officer conducted a hearing pursu-\nant to the Board's August 4 order. At the hearing, the parties stipu-\nlated that the LPNs at the Beverly facility were, at all times relevant\nto the petition, \"supervisors\" within the meaning of § 2(11) of the Act.\nHowever, the parties disputed whether the election should be set aside\nand the certification revoked or, alternatively, whether the certifica-\ntion could be merely amended to exclude the LPNs from the bargain-\ning unit. Additionally, Beverly argued that the entire election process,\nincluding the Union's showing of interest, was tainted by the LPNs'\nactive participation in the election campaign. In support of this posi-\ntion, Beverly attempted, but was not permitted, to put on evidence\nwith regard to the LPNs' conduct prior to the election. Specifically,\nBeverly proffered the testimony of LPNs who were employed during\nthe 1992 campaign, the content of which was that a number of LPNs\nattended Union meetings, signed Union authorization cards, solicited\n\n                    4\n\fauthorization cards from non-supervisory employees, actively cam-\npaigned for the Union with employees over whom the LPNs exercised\nsupervisory authority, and encouraged such employees to vote for the\nUnion.\n\nOn November 16, 1994, the Regional Director issued a supplemen-\ntal decision revoking the certification of the Union and directing a\nnew election. The Regional Director found that the exclusion of the\nLPNs represented a major change in the scope and character of the\nbargaining unit, thereby invalidating the election and requiring that a\nnew election be held. The Regional Director rejected, however, Bev-\nerly's contention that the representation petition should be dismissed\nbecause of the participation of the LPNs in the organizational cam-\npaign, noting that the validity of the showing of interest is not subject\nto litigation and that Beverly's challenge thereto, coming two years\nafter the filing of the petition, was untimely.\n\nOn December 2, 1994, the Union filed a request for review of the\nRegional Director's decision; Beverly did not file a request for\nreview. On October 31, 1995, the Board issued a decision in which\nit reinstated the Union's certification, amending the certified bargain-\ning unit to exclude LPNs and vacating the Regional Director's direc-\ntion of a new election. Contrary to the Regional Director, the Board\nfound that the exclusion of the LPNs, one of ten job classifications\nand sixteen of eighty-two employees, from the pre-election unit did\nnot change the basic character and scope of the unit. In addition, the\nBoard noted that the election was not close and that, even without the\nvotes of the LPNs, the Union had won by at least nineteen votes. Not-\ning that Beverly had not requested review of the Regional Director's\ndecision, the Board declined to address the Regional Director's rejec-\ntion of Beverly's argument that the LPNs' pre-election conduct\ntainted both the showing of interest and the election and required the\ndismissal of the representation petition.\n\nOn November 15, 1995, the Union requested that Beverly meet for\nnegotiations. On December 1, 1995, two days after the issuance of the\namended certification, the Union renewed its bargaining request. Bev-\nerly did not respond, and on December 6, 1995, the Union filed an\nunfair labor practice charge against Beverly, alleging violations of\n§§ 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(a)(1) and (5). The\n\n                     5\n\fUnion filed an amended charge on January 23, 1996, and on February\n1, 1996, the Regional Director issued a complaint, to which Beverly\ntimely filed an answer.\n\nOn April 2, 1996, the Board's general counsel filed a motion for\nsummary judgment with the Board. On April 10, 1996, the Board\nissued a notice to show cause why the motion for summary judgment\nshould not be granted. On April 23, 1996, Beverly filed its response,\nreiterating its position that the exclusion of the LPNs from the bar-\ngaining unit changed its character and scope so as to render the elec-\ntion invalid. In addition, Beverly argued that the alleged participation\nof the LPNs in the organizational campaign raised a serious question\nas to the validity of the election.\n\nOn May 15, 1996, the Board granted the general counsel's motion\nfor summary judgment and ordered Beverly to bargain with the\nUnion. In its decision, the Board found that all representation issues\nraised by Beverly had been or could have been litigated in the prior\nrepresentation proceeding. On August 28, 1996, the Board filed an\napplication in this court for enforcement of the Board's order.\n\nII.\n\nThe Board enjoys broad latitude to develop and implement the pro-\ncedures for certification elections. See Sears, Roebuck & Co. v.\nNLRB, 957 F.2d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 1992); Nightingale Oil Co. v. NLRB,\n905 F.2d 528, 531 (1st Cir. 1990); NLRB v. Lorimar Productions,\nInc., 771 F.2d 1294, 1298 (9th Cir. 1985). As a general rule, the\nBoard's findings are to be accepted if they are supported by substan-\ntial evidence on the record as a whole. See Monongahela Power Co.\nv. NLRB, 657 F.2d 608, 611 (4th Cir. 1981). We review the Board's\ndecision to uphold an election for abuse of discretion. See NLRB v.\nVSA, Inc., 24 F.3d 588, 592 (4th Cir. 1994); NLRB v. Manufacturers\nPackaging Co., Inc., 645 F.2d 223, 225 (4th Cir. 1981).\n\nIII.\n\nAs a general rule, the burden is on the party challenging the valid-\nity of the election to prove that its fairness has been compromised.\n\n                    6\n\fSee Manufacturers Packaging Co., 645 F.2d at 225. The test is not\nwhether optimum practices were followed, but whether the manner in\nwhich the election was held raises a reasonable doubt as to its valid-\nity. See Nightingale Oil Co., 905 F.2d at 531; see also NLRB v. Her-\nbert Halperin Distrib. Corp., 826 F.2d 287, 290 (4th Cir. 1987) (party\nchallenging election \"must show by specific evidence `not only that\nimproprieties occurred, but also that . . . they materially affected the\nelection results'\" (citation omitted)). Nevertheless, \"when the Board\nhas effectively denied employees the right to make an informed\nchoice in a representation election,\" an order of the Board will not be\nenforced. See Hamilton Test Sys. v. NLRB, 743 F.2d 136, 142 (2d Cir.\n1984).\n\nWhere employees are led to believe that they are voting on a partic-\nular bargaining unit and that bargaining unit is subsequently modified\npost-election, such that the bargaining unit, as modified, is fundamen-\ntally different in scope or character from the proposed bargaining\nunit, the employees have effectively been denied the right to make an\ninformed choice in the representation election. See NLRB v. Parsons\nSch. of Design, 793 F.2d 503, 506-08 (2d Cir. 1986); Lorimar\nProductions, 771 F.2d at 1301-02; Hamilton Test Sys., 743 F.2d at\n140-42. Thus, the Board may not \"inform employees that they are\nvoting for representation in [one] unit and later . . . consider the ballot\nas a vote for representation in a [different] unit.\" Hamilton Test Sys.,\n743 F.2d at 140; see also Lorimar Productions , 771 F.2d at 1301\n(quoting Hamilton Test Sys.). In determining whether an employee's\nfreedom to make an informed choice has been compromised by the\nsubsequent modification of the bargaining unit for which he voted, we\nconsider several factors: (1) the difference in size between the bar-\ngaining unit proposed to the employees before the election and the\nfinal size of the unit; (2) the character and scope of the pre- and post-\nelection units; and (3) the closeness of the election results. See Sears,\nRoebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57.\n\nThe first factor to be considered in determining whether a post-\nelection modification of the bargaining unit necessitates the invalida-\ntion of the election is the difference in size between the bargaining\nunit proposed to the employees before the election and the final size\nof the unit. In this case, the exclusion of the LPNs from the bargain-\ning unit decreased its size by approximately 20%. Although the Board\n\n                     7\n\fargues that the exclusion of one out of ten employee classifications\nand 20% of the number of eligible voters is not a significant change\nin the size of the bargaining unit, it is certainly true, as the Second\nCircuit Court of Appeals has recognized, that \"a smaller bargaining\nunit may be less attractive to potential union members because of\nreduced bargaining power.\" Sears, Roebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57.\nThus, while a 20% increase in the size of the bargaining unit may not\nbe likely to affect the other employees' votes, a 20% decrease may\nwell have such an effect. Compare Parsons Sch. of Design, 793 F.2d\nat 507-08 (10% decrease in size of unit) with Nightingale Oil Co., 905\nF.2d at 57 (10% increase in size of unit). Accordingly, this factor\nweighs in favor of denying the Board's application for enforcement.\n\nThe second factor to be considered is the character and scope of the\npre- and post-election units. This factor requires the court to consider\nthe similarity or dissimilarity of job classifications between the origi-\nnal and final units and the possibility that the final unit split an other-\nwise unified work force. See Sears, Roebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57-\n58. For example, in Parsons School of Design, the Second Circuit\nheld that an election in favor of union representation should be set\naside because of the post-election modification of the bargaining unit\nto exclude all full-time faculty members. See Parsons Sch. of Design,\n793 F.2d at 507-08. As originally proposed and voted upon, the bar-\ngaining unit included both part-time and full-time faculty members.\nSee id. at 504-05. Although the exclusion of the full-time faculty\nmembers resulted in a numerical reduction of only 10% of the bar-\ngaining unit, the Second Circuit recognized that full-time faculty\nmembers were \"particularly important to the school and carr[ied]\ngreat weight in all matters affecting it,\" making their exclusion from\nthe bargaining unit particularly significant. Id. at 507-08.\n\nIn this case, although the LPNs numbered only sixteen of eighty-\ntwo eligible employees in the bargaining unit, they supervised forty-\nsix of the eligible employees. As supervisors, they had the responsi-\nbility for scheduling the daily assignments for their subordinates and\nfor evaluating their performance. Because the LPNs wielded such a\nsignificant amount of influence, it is likely that a number of the\nemployees voted in favor of Union representation in this case with the\nunderstanding that the bargaining unit would, if successful, include\ntheir supervisors. It is also quite possible that had the proposed bar-\n\n                     8\n\fgaining unit not included the LPNs, many of their forty-six subordi-\nnates may not have voted in favor of representation, fearing a division\nbetween them and their supervisors. Therefore, the influence wielded\nby the LPNs may have been an important factor in the decision of\nother employees to vote in favor of representation. The impact of their\nexclusion from the bargaining unit, then, may go well beyond their\nsixteen votes. In short, because of the importance of the LPNs to the\nproposed bargaining unit as a whole, their subsequent exclusion post-\nelection fundamentally changed the character of the unit, and this fac-\ntor also weighs in favor of denying the Board's application for\nenforcement.\n\nThe third and final factor to be considered when determining\nwhether to invalidate an election based on a post-election modifica-\ntion of the bargaining unit is the closeness of the election results. See\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57. In this case, the Union victory\nwas decisive with fifty-five votes cast in favor of Union representa-\ntion and twenty votes cast against Union representation. Even if every\nLPN who voted in the election voted in favor of Union representation,\nthe exclusion of the LPNs as part of the bargaining unit would result\nin an election in favor of Union representation by nineteen votes. This\nfactor, then, weighs in favor of granting the Board's application for\nenforcement.\n\nConsidering all three factors in this case, we conclude that the\nBoard abused its discretion in certifying a bargaining unit that dif-\nfered significantly both in the number of employees included in the\nbargaining unit and in the unit's character and scope from the bar-\ngaining unit voted upon by the employees. Although the strength of\nthe Union's victory clearly weighs against invalidation of the election,\nthis factor must be considered in light of the fact that the excluded\nLPNs had direct supervisory authority over forty-six of the sixty-six\nemployees remaining in the bargaining unit after the LPNs' exclusion.\nIf only ten of those employees who voted in favor of Union represen-\ntation did so because of their understanding that their supervisors\nwould also be part of the bargaining unit, the election results might\nhave been different had the LPNs been excluded prior to the vote. To\nthe extent that the third factor weighs against the invalidation of the\nelection, then, it is outweighed by the first two factors, both of which\nweigh heavily in favor of invalidation of the election. Because the\n\n                    9\n\fpost-election exclusion of the LPNs from the bargaining unit so sig-\nnificantly changed the character and scope of the bargaining unit, the\nBeverly employees were effectively denied the right to make an\ninformed choice in the representation election. As a result, the Board\nabused its discretion in certifying the election results, and its order\ncompelling Beverly to bargain with the Union based on the validity\nof the election may not be enforced.\n\nWe reject the Board's suggestion that our decision is inconsistent\nwith this court's decision in Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. NLRB, 832\nF.2d 857 (4th Cir. 1987). In Prudential, one employee was errone-\nously included in a proposed bargaining unit because she was a \"con-\nfidential employee.\" See id. at 860 (recognizing that certain\nconfidential employees are excluded from collective bargaining\nunits). Including the confidential employee, the bargaining unit con-\ntained seven members. The vote in the representation election was 4-\n1 in favor of union representation, with two challenged votes sealed\nand not counted in the election tally. On appeal, we rejected Pruden-\ntial's argument that the exclusion of the confidential employee neces-\nsarily required the invalidation of the representation election because\nthe other employees' votes may have been different had they known\nthat the confidential employee was not a member of the bargaining\nunit. See id. at 861. Instead, we remanded the case for the Board to\nconsider whether, based on the Board's resolution of the two chal-\nlenged ballots, the exclusion of the confidential employee's vote\ncould have affected the union's victory. See id.\n\nThe Board argues that Prudential requires us to uphold its decision\nvalidating the representation election in this case, suggesting, in\nessence, that Prudential stands for the proposition that a new election\nis unnecessary where a proposed bargaining unit has been modified\npost-election, unless we conclude, based on a numerical analysis\nalone, that the election results would have been different had the\nemployees voted on the appropriate bargaining unit. We do not\nbelieve that Prudential stands for such a broad proposition. Instead,\nPrudential stands for the narrower proposition that a new election is\nnot always required where a bargaining unit is modified post-election;\nrather, the court must assess the potential impact of the modification\non several levels. In that decision, for example, when distinguishing\nHamilton Test Systems, we specifically noted that the modified bar-\n\n                    10\n\fgaining unit in Hamilton Test Systems was less than half the size and\n\"`considerably different in character'\" from the proposed bargaining\nunit, while the modified bargaining unit in Prudential was only one\nemployee smaller than the proposed bargaining unit. Id. at 861 (cita-\ntion omitted). Our discussion in Prudential about Hamilton Test\nSystems, then, suggests that, in addition to the closeness of the elec-\ntion results, both the size and the character and scope of the modified\nbargaining unit are appropriate considerations when deciding whether\nan election must be invalidated.\n\nWhen all relevant factors are considered, it is clear that the circum-\nstances in this case differ significantly from those presented to the\ncourt in Prudential. First, the modified bargaining unit in Prudential\ncontained only one less employee than the proposed bargaining unit,\nwhile the modified bargaining unit in this case contains sixteen fewer\nemployees. Second, and more importantly, in this case, there was a\nsupervisory relationship between the LPNs and the other employees,\nand it affected over two-thirds of the employees remaining in the bar-\ngaining unit after the LPNs were excluded. Therefore, while the\nexclusion of only one employee who does not have supervisory\nauthority over other members of the proposed bargaining unit may not\nchange the character and scope of the bargaining unit, as the court\nimplicitly held in Prudential, the exclusion of the LPNs in this case\nwho supervised most of the other employees in the bargaining unit\nfundamentally changed the character and scope of the bargaining unit.\nBecause the circumstances in this case are fundamentally different\nfrom those presented to the court in Prudential , a different conclusion\nis warranted.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we deny the Board's application for\nenforcement of its bargaining order against Beverly. 2\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 In addition to arguing that the Board abused its discretion in certifying\nthe election results in light of the post-election modification of the bar-\ngaining unit, Beverly argues that the election should be set aside because\nof inappropriate supervisor behavior during the election campaign.\nBecause we conclude that the Board's application for enforcement of its\nbargaining order should be denied on the former ground, we decline to\nconsider the latter.\n\n                    11\n\fENFORCEMENT DENIED.3\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nI would enforce the bargaining order of the National Labor Rela-\ntions Board certifying the election. In formulating procedures for the\nconduct of an election, the Board is entitled to make \"justifiable and\nreasonable adjustment[s] of the democratic process,\" to accommodate\ninterests such as finality and minimizing delay. NLRB v. A.J. Tower\nCo., 329 U.S. 324, 333 (1946). Furthermore, the Board's factual find-\nings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record\nas a whole, even if \"we might have decided the case differently de\nnovo.\" National Poster, Inc. v. NLRB, 885 F.2d 175, 178 (4th Cir.\n1989). The Board's determination that the election was fairly con-\nducted can be set aside only for an abuse of discretion. See\nNightingale Oil Co. v. NLRB, 905 F.2d 528, 531 (1st Cir. 1990); see\nalso NLRB v. VSA, Inc., 24 F.3d 588, 592 (4th Cir. 1994). After a\ncareful review of the record, I cannot conclude that the Board abused\nits discretion. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the majority's\nholding to the contrary.\n\nI agree with the majority that the non-exclusive, three factor test\nstated in Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. NLRB, 957 F.2d 52, 57 (2d Cir.\n1992) governs our analysis. Under Sears, we look to: \"(1) the differ-\nence in size between the bargaining unit proposed to the employees\nbefore the election and the final size of the unit; (2) the character and\nscope of the pre- and post-election unit; and (3) the closeness of the\nelection results.\" Id.\n_________________________________________________________________\n3 Because over five years have elapsed since the representation petition\nin this case was filed and because of the particular factual circumstances\nof this case, we simply deny the Board's application for enforcement and\nchoose not to remand this case for further proceedings by the Board. See\nNLRB v. Lundy Packing Co., 68 F.3d 1577, 1583 (4th Cir. 1995) (deny-\ning petition for enforcement of bargaining order where the Board certi-\nfied an inappropriate bargaining unit). In accordance with our decision\nin NLRB v. Lundy Packing Co., 81 F.3d 25 (4th Cir. 1996), the Board\nno longer has jurisdiction over this case and may not revive the represen-\ntation petition that is the subject of this decision. See id. at 25-26.\n\n                    12\n\fUnlike the majority, however, I believe, as the Board found, that\nthe facts of this case do not indicate \"a significant change in unit size\nto warrant setting aside the election\" under the first prong of the Sears\ntest. In this case the pre-election unit included 82 eligible voters,\nincluding 16 LPNs. The exclusion of the LPNs reduced the size of the\nbargaining unit by approximately twenty percent. In upholding the\nelection, the Board compared this modification with those in another\nBoard decision, Toledo Hospital, 315 NLRB 594 (1994), in which the\nBoard upheld an election after the addition of a number of employees\nexpanded the unit by 19.5 percent. The Board then distinguished\nHamilton Test Sys. v. NLRB, 743 F.2d 136 (2d Cir. 1984) and NLRB\nv. Lorimar Productions, Inc., 771 F.2d 1294 (9th Cir. 1985), where\nthe unit differentials exceeded 40 percent, by the size of the numerical\nchange in the unit.\n\nThe Board's conclusion maintains consistency with this court's\napplication of the Sears test in Prudential Ins. Co. v. NLRB, 832 F.2d\n857, 859 (4th Cir. 1987). In Prudential, the employees had voted for\nthe union 4-1, with two votes disputed. We held that one of the voters\nwas a confidential employee who could not be a member of the bar-\ngaining unit. Id. at 860. Despite this twenty percent change in the size\nof the unit, the same differential at stake in the present case, we did\nnot order a new election, as the employer requested. Id. at 861.\nInstead, we remanded the case to the NLRB \"to consider the two\nvotes challenged by the Union and not included in the tally\" to estab-\nlish whether the disputed votes and the removal of the confidential\nemployee \"would affect the Union's majority status.\" Id. If the Union\nlost its majority it would \"be necessary to hold a new election in a\nproperly constituted unit. Otherwise, the representation result must\nstand.\" Id. Thus, despite the removal of the confidential employee\nfrom a five member unit, a potential loss of 20 percent, we held that\na new election was not automatically required.\n\nThe majority, citing Sears, places significant weight on the fact that\nthe unit size approved by the Board was smaller than that voted on\nby the employees, just as it was in NLRB v. Parsons School of Design,\n793 F.2d 503 (2d Cir. 1986)(invalidating the election procedures). In\nParsons, however, the election was extremely close and the court\nemphasized that the character and scope of the unit had been signifi-\ncantly altered. Parsons, 793 F.2d at 504. Neither of these factors are\n\n                     13\n\fpresent here. Furthermore, though it may be true that \"a smaller bar-\ngaining unit may be less attractive to potential union members\nbecause of reduced bargaining power,\" Sears , 957 F.2d at 57, I see\nno reason why the opposite may not be true as well. Some union\nmembers may prefer smaller units that better represent their specific\ninterests, or they may prefer to separate themselves from other\nemployees who do not perform similar work, earn equivalent pay, or\notherwise share their community of interests.\n\nThe second Sears factor focuses on the change in character and\nscope of the unit before and after modification:\n\n          This factor requires consideration of the similarity or dis-\n          similarity of job classifications between the original and\n          final units and the chance that the ultimate unit split an oth-\n          erwise unified workforce. . . . If the new composition of the\n          unit excludes workers performing under conditions similar\n          to those already included in the unit, employees are more\n          likely to have voted differently because they may feel that\n          their individual interests cannot be best represented by a\n          group consisting of diverse, potentially adverse interests.\n\nSears, 957 F.2d at 57-58 (citations omitted).\n\nIn the present case, the Board found that \"the scope and character\nof the unit has not changed to any significant extent, and the unit\nremains the service and maintenance unit petitioned-for originally.\" In\nmy view, although I recognize that it is a close question, the fact that\nthere is no evidence that the LPNs had greater bargaining power than\nthe other unit members as well as the large margin of victory provide\nsufficient evidentiary support for these findings.\n\nBeverly argues to the contrary, asserting that because the LPNs\nsupervised approximately half of the members of the bargaining unit,\nthe LPNs' removal is very significant and would alter the vote. In\nmaking this contention, the company relies heavily on the Second\nCircuit's decision in Parsons. In Parsons, both full-time and part-time\nfaculty had originally voted for the union but the court subsequently\nremoved the full-time faculty from the unit. This action was held to\nhave significantly altered the unit because the\"full-time faculty\n\n                    14\n\femployees excluded from the unit, while comparatively few in num-\nber, are particularly important to the school and carry great weight in\nall matters affecting it.\" Parsons, 793 F.2d at 507. Because \"the elec-\ntion was a very close one\" and \"the part-time instructors may have\nfeared insufficient strength in a unit comprising less than all of the\nfaculty,\" the Second Circuit ordered a new election. Id. at 508.\n\nAlthough there are similarities between this case and Parsons,\nthere are two critical differences. First, the remaining employees in\nthe bargaining unit at issue in the case at hand are all classified as\nfull-time. There is no evidence of a bargaining power differential\nbetween the LPNs and the other Beverly employees like that between\nthe full-time and part-time faculty at issue in Parsons. Second, the\nelection in the present case was not nearly as close as that in Parsons,\nwhere a vote change by \"only four of the 99 part-time instructors who\nvoted for the Union\" would have changed the result of the election.\nId. at 508. Here, even assuming that all 16 LPNs voted for the union,\nthe margin of victory would still be 39-22.\n\nThe final factor addressed under the Sears test is the margin of vic-\ntory in the election. \"A narrow victory heightens the need to scruti-\nnize the election process to ensure that votes would not change with\na more fully informed electorate. [Parsons , 793 F.2d at 507]. This\nfactor must be observed in combination with the two other factors\naddressed above in order to see if the concerns uncovered in examin-\ning the other factors would have led to a vote change sufficient to\nalter the election outcome.\" Sears, 957 F.2d at 58 (emphasis added).\n\nThe purpose of this third factor is to weigh the potential votes lost\nthrough the change in the size, scope, and character of the unit against\nthe margin of victory for the union. In instances where the margin of\nvictory is small, any change in the size of the unit or character may\nnecessitate a new election. See Parsons, 793 F.2d at 508 (noting that\nif \"four of the 99 part-time instructors\" changed their vote, union\nwould lose); Lorimar Productions, 771 F.2d at 1302 (\"The vote was\nso close that the union would have lost had one employee voted dif-\nferently.\"); Hamilton Test Systems, 743 F.2d at 141 (\"A change of one\nvote from union to non-union would have altered the outcome of the\nelection.\"); Monongahela Power Co. v. NLRB , 657 F.2d 608, 609 (4th\nCir. 1981)(noting that the union won vote 58-56).\n\n                    15\n\fIn the present case, as the Board found and the majority acknowl-\nedges, the election was not close: 55 employees voted for the union\nand 22 against. Even assuming that all 16 LPNs voted for the union,\nan assumption with no support in the record, the margin would still\nbe 39-22. In weighing this margin of victory with the other two fac-\ntors, it seems to me that the Board did not abuse its discretion by con-\ncluding that the exclusion of the LPNs would not change the votes of\nthe employees in a new election. Beverly is unable to cite a single\ncase in which a court ordered a new election or refused to abide by\nthe Board's decision not to do so when the margin of the original\nunion victory was as great as that in this case. As the majority recog-\nnizes, the National Labor Relations Board \"enjoys broad latitude to\ndevelop and implement the procedure for certification of elections.\"\nAnte at 9. Given the margin of victory, I cannot agree with the major-\nity that the Board exceeded that broad authority and abused its discre-\ntion.\n\n                    16\n\f",

(Beverly). Beverly asserts that the Board improperly certi-\nfied election results in favor of representation by the Health Care and\nSocial Service Union, SEIU, AFL-CIO (the Union), after modifying\nthe bargaining unit post-election to exclude all licensed practical\nnurses (LPNs). Because the Board's election procedures denied the\nemployees an opportunity to vote for representation in the unit certi-\nfied by the Board, we deny the Board's application for enforcement\nof its order.\n\nI.\n\nBeverly, d/b/a Morgan Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Center,\noperates a 100-bed long-term nursing care facility in Morgantown,\nWest Virginia. On June 16, 1992, the Union filed a petition for certifi-\ncation of representation with Region Six of the Board. The petition\nincluded a proposed bargaining unit consisting of all full-time and\nregular part-time service and maintenance employees at the nursing\nhome, including LPNs and nine other job classifications. The petition\n\n                    2\n\fexcluded, among others, all supervisors as defined in § 2(11) of the\nNational Labor Relations Act (the Act).1 See 29 U.S.C. § 152(11).\n\nOn July 13, 1992, a Board hearing officer conducted a representa-\ntion hearing, the primary issue of which was whether the LPNs at the\nBeverly facility were \"supervisors\" within the meaning of § 2(11) of\nthe Act. See id. Beverly argued that the LPNs should be excluded\nfrom the bargaining unit as supervisors. Of the approximately eighty-\ntwo employees in the proposed bargaining unit, sixteen were LPNs.\nThese LPNs had a certain amount of authority over another forty-six\nemployees included in the proposed bargaining unit, including the\nauthority to arrange work schedules and to evaluate the performance\nof these employees.\n\nOn July 31, 1992, the Regional Director for Region Six issued a\ndecision and direction of election in which he found that the LPNs\nwere not supervisors under § 2(11) of the Act. Beverly filed a timely\nrequest for review of the Regional Director's decision, and on August\n27, 1992, the Board denied Beverly's request for review. On that\nsame day, an election was conducted at the Beverly facility. In con-\nducting the election, the Regional Director permitted the LPNs to\nvote, and he did not segregate the ballots of the LPNs from the ballots\nof the other employees. In addition, Beverly was not permitted to\nchallenge the ballots of the LPNs. Of the eighty-two eligible employ-\nees, seventy-five employees voted. Fifty-five employees voted in\nfavor of Union representation, while twenty employees voted against\nUnion representation. Three ballots were challenged. On September\n9, 1992, the Regional Director, noting that no objections to the elec-\n_________________________________________________________________\n1 The unit described on the official notice of election included:\n\n          All full-time and regular part-time service and maintenance\n          employees, including licensed practical nurses, certified nurse's\n          aides, nurse's aides, dietary employees, environmental service\n          employees, medical records coordinator, central supply clerk,\n          physical therapy aides, activities director's assistants and mainte-\n          nance employees employed by [Beverly] at its Morgantown,\n          West Virginia facility; excluding all office clerical employees,\n          registered nurses and guards, professional employees and\n          supervisors as defined in the Act.\n\n(J.A. 21 (emphasis added)).\n\n                    3\n\ftion had been filed, certified the Union as the exclusive bargaining\nrepresentative of the unit employees.\n\nTwo days later, on September 11, 1992, we denied enforcement of\nthe Board's order in a case in which the issue was whether LPNs at\na different health care facility were statutory supervisors under\n§ 2(11) of the Act. See Beverly Calif. Corp. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">223815</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. Sept. 11, 1992) (unpublished opinion). Following\nthis decision, Beverly filed a request for reconsideration of the\nBoard's certification of the election in this case. On May 26, 1993,\nthe Board granted Beverly's request for reconsideration, finding that\nit raised substantial issues warranting review. Almost one year later,\non May 11, 1994, the Board affirmed the Regional Director's decision\nand direction of election.\n\nTwo weeks later, on May 23, 1994, the Supreme Court issued its\ndecision in NLRB v. Health Care & Retirement Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087953/nlrb-v-health-care-retirement-corp-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1994), in which it rejected the \"patient care analysis\" on which both\nthe Regional Director and the Board had relied in finding that the\nLPNs in this case were employees and not \"supervisors\" under\n§ 2(11) of the Act. In light of this decision, Beverly filed a second\nmotion for reconsideration. On August 4, 1994, the Board granted\nBeverly's motion and remanded the case to the Regional Director for\nreconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision.\n\nOn October 24, 1994, a hearing officer conducted a hearing pursu-\nant to the Board's August 4 order. At the hearing, the parties stipu-\nlated that the LPNs at the Beverly facility were, at all times relevant\nto the petition, \"supervisors\" within the meaning of § 2(11) of the Act.\nHowever, the parties disputed whether the election should be set aside\nand the certification revoked or, alternatively, whether the certifica-\ntion could be merely amended to exclude the LPNs from the bargain-\ning unit. Additionally, Beverly argued that the entire election process,\nincluding the Union's showing of interest, was tainted by the LPNs'\nactive participation in the election campaign. In support of this posi-\ntion, Beverly attempted, but was not permitted, to put on evidence\nwith regard to the LPNs' conduct prior to the election. Specifically,\nBeverly proffered the testimony of LPNs who were employed during\nthe 1992 campaign, the content of which was that a number of LPNs\nattended Union meetings, signed Union authorization cards, solicited\n\n                    4\n\fauthorization cards from non-supervisory employees, actively cam-\npaigned for the Union with employees over whom the LPNs exercised\nsupervisory authority, and encouraged such employees to vote for the\nUnion.\n\nOn November 16, 1994, the Regional Director issued a supplemen-\ntal decision revoking the certification of the Union and directing a\nnew election. The Regional Director found that the exclusion of the\nLPNs represented a major change in the scope and character of the\nbargaining unit, thereby invalidating the election and requiring that a\nnew election be held. The Regional Director rejected, however, Bev-\nerly's contention that the representation petition should be dismissed\nbecause of the participation of the LPNs in the organizational cam-\npaign, noting that the validity of the showing of interest is not subject\nto litigation and that Beverly's challenge thereto, coming two years\nafter the filing of the petition, was untimely.\n\nOn December 2, 1994, the Union filed a request for review of the\nRegional Director's decision; Beverly did not file a request for\nreview. On October 31, 1995, the Board issued a decision in which\nit reinstated the Union's certification, amending the certified bargain-\ning unit to exclude LPNs and vacating the Regional Director's direc-\ntion of a new election. Contrary to the Regional Director, the Board\nfound that the exclusion of the LPNs, one of ten job classifications\nand sixteen of eighty-two employees, from the pre-election unit did\nnot change the basic character and scope of the unit. In addition, the\nBoard noted that the election was not close and that, even without the\nvotes of the LPNs, the Union had won by at least nineteen votes. Not-\ning that Beverly had not requested review of the Regional Director's\ndecision, the Board declined to address the Regional Director's rejec-\ntion of Beverly's argument that the LPNs' pre-election conduct\ntainted both the showing of interest and the election and required the\ndismissal of the representation petition.\n\nOn November 15, 1995, the Union requested that Beverly meet for\nnegotiations. On December 1, 1995, two days after the issuance of the\namended certification, the Union renewed its bargaining request. Bev-\nerly did not respond, and on December 6, 1995, the Union filed an\nunfair labor practice charge against Beverly, alleging violations of\n§§ 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act. See 29 U.S.C. §§ 158(a)(1) and (5). The\n\n                     5\n\fUnion filed an amended charge on January 23, 1996, and on February\n1, 1996, the Regional Director issued a complaint, to which Beverly\ntimely filed an answer.\n\nOn April 2, 1996, the Board's general counsel filed a motion for\nsummary judgment with the Board. On April 10, 1996, the Board\nissued a notice to show cause why the motion for summary judgment\nshould not be granted. On April 23, 1996, Beverly filed its response,\nreiterating its position that the exclusion of the LPNs from the bar-\ngaining unit changed its character and scope so as to render the elec-\ntion invalid. In addition, Beverly argued that the alleged participation\nof the LPNs in the organizational campaign raised a serious question\nas to the validity of the election.\n\nOn May 15, 1996, the Board granted the general counsel's motion\nfor summary judgment and ordered Beverly to bargain with the\nUnion. In its decision, the Board found that all representation issues\nraised by Beverly had been or could have been litigated in the prior\nrepresentation proceeding. On August 28, 1996, the Board filed an\napplication in this court for enforcement of the Board's order.\n\nII.\n\nThe Board enjoys broad latitude to develop and implement the pro-\ncedures for certification elections.

Thus, the Board may not \"inform employees that they are\nvoting for representation in [one] unit and later . . . consider the ballot\nas a vote for representation in a [different] unit.\" Hamilton Test Sys.,\n743 F.2d at 140; see also Lorimar Productions , 771 F.2d at 1301\n(quoting Hamilton Test Sys.). In determining whether an employee's\nfreedom to make an informed choice has been compromised by the\nsubsequent modification of the bargaining unit for which he voted, we\nconsider several factors: (1) the difference in size between the bar-\ngaining unit proposed to the employees before the election and the\nfinal size of the unit; (2) the character and scope of the pre- and post-\nelection units; and (3) the closeness of the election results. See Sears,\nRoebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57.\n\nThe first factor to be considered in determining whether a post-\nelection modification of the bargaining unit necessitates the invalida-\ntion of the election is the difference in size between the bargaining\nunit proposed to the employees before the election and the final size\nof the unit. In this case, the exclusion of the LPNs from the bargain-\ning unit decreased its size by approximately 20%. Although the Board\n\n                     7\n\fargues that the exclusion of one out of ten employee classifications\nand 20% of the number of eligible voters is not a significant change\nin the size of the bargaining unit, it is certainly true, as the Second\nCircuit Court of Appeals has recognized, that \"a smaller bargaining\nunit may be less attractive to potential union members because of\nreduced bargaining power.\" Sears, Roebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57.\nThus, while a 20% increase in the size of the bargaining unit may not\nbe likely to affect the other employees' votes, a 20% decrease may\nwell have such an effect. Compare Parsons Sch. of Design, 793 F.2d\nat 507-08 (10% decrease in size of unit) with Nightingale Oil Co., 905\nF.2d at 57 (10% increase in size of unit). Accordingly, this factor\nweighs in favor of denying the Board's application for enforcement.\n\nThe second factor to be considered is the character and scope of the\npre- and post-election units. This factor requires the court to consider\nthe similarity or dissimilarity of job classifications between the origi-\nnal and final units and the possibility that the final unit split an other-\nwise unified work force. See Sears, Roebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57-\n58. For example, in Parsons School of Design, the Second Circuit\nheld that an election in favor of union representation should be set\naside because of the post-election modification of the bargaining unit\nto exclude all full-time faculty members. See Parsons Sch. of Design,\n793 F.2d at 507-08. As originally proposed and voted upon, the bar-\ngaining unit included both part-time and full-time faculty members.\nSee id. at 504-05. Although the exclusion of the full-time faculty\nmembers resulted in a numerical reduction of only 10% of the bar-\ngaining unit, the Second Circuit recognized that full-time faculty\nmembers were \"particularly important to the school and carr[ied]\ngreat weight in all matters affecting it,\" making their exclusion from\nthe bargaining unit particularly significant. Id. at 507-08.\n\nIn this case, although the LPNs numbered only sixteen of eighty-\ntwo eligible employees in the bargaining unit, they supervised forty-\nsix of the eligible employees. As supervisors, they had the responsi-\nbility for scheduling the daily assignments for their subordinates and\nfor evaluating their performance. Because the LPNs wielded such a\nsignificant amount of influence, it is likely that a number of the\nemployees voted in favor of Union representation in this case with the\nunderstanding that the bargaining unit would, if successful, include\ntheir supervisors. It is also quite possible that had the proposed bar-\n\n                     8\n\fgaining unit not included the LPNs, many of their forty-six subordi-\nnates may not have voted in favor of representation, fearing a division\nbetween them and their supervisors. Therefore, the influence wielded\nby the LPNs may have been an important factor in the decision of\nother employees to vote in favor of representation. The impact of their\nexclusion from the bargaining unit, then, may go well beyond their\nsixteen votes. In short, because of the importance of the LPNs to the\nproposed bargaining unit as a whole, their subsequent exclusion post-\nelection fundamentally changed the character of the unit, and this fac-\ntor also weighs in favor of denying the Board's application for\nenforcement.\n\nThe third and final factor to be considered when determining\nwhether to invalidate an election based on a post-election modifica-\ntion of the bargaining unit is the closeness of the election results. See\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 957 F.2d at 57. In this case, the Union victory\nwas decisive with fifty-five votes cast in favor of Union representa-\ntion and twenty votes cast against Union representation. Even if every\nLPN who voted in the election voted in favor of Union representation,\nthe exclusion of the LPNs as part of the bargaining unit would result\nin an election in favor of Union representation by nineteen votes. This\nfactor, then, weighs in favor of granting the Board's application for\nenforcement.\n\nConsidering all three factors in this case, we conclude that the\nBoard abused its discretion in certifying a bargaining unit that dif-\nfered significantly both in the number of employees included in the\nbargaining unit and in the unit's character and scope from the bar-\ngaining unit voted upon by the employees. Although the strength of\nthe Union's victory clearly weighs against invalidation of the election,\nthis factor must be considered in light of the fact that the excluded\nLPNs had direct supervisory authority over forty-six of the sixty-six\nemployees remaining in the bargaining unit after the LPNs' exclusion.\nIf only ten of those employees who voted in favor of Union represen-\ntation did so because of their understanding that their supervisors\nwould also be part of the bargaining unit, the election results might\nhave been different had the LPNs been excluded prior to the vote. To\nthe extent that the third factor weighs against the invalidation of the\nelection, then, it is outweighed by the first two factors, both of which\nweigh heavily in favor of invalidation of the election. Because the\n\n                    9\n\fpost-election exclusion of the LPNs from the bargaining unit so sig-\nnificantly changed the character and scope of the bargaining unit, the\nBeverly employees were effectively denied the right to make an\ninformed choice in the representation election. As a result, the Board\nabused its discretion in certifying the election results, and its order\ncompelling Beverly to bargain with the Union based on the validity\nof the election may not be enforced.\n\nWe reject the Board's suggestion that our decision is inconsistent\nwith this court's decision in Prudential Ins. Co. of Am. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496800\"><a href=\"/opinion/496800/prudential-insurance-company-of-america-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1987). In Prudential, one employee was errone-\nously included in a proposed bargaining unit because she was a \"con-\nfidential employee.\" See id. at 860 (recognizing that certain\nconfidential employees are excluded from collective bargaining\nunits). Including the confidential employee, the bargaining unit con-\ntained seven members. The vote in the representation election was 4-\n1 in favor of union representation, with two challenged votes sealed\nand not counted in the election tally. On appeal, we rejected Pruden-\ntial's argument that the exclusion of the confidential employee neces-\nsarily required the invalidation of the representation election because\nthe other employees' votes may have been different had they known\nthat the confidential employee was not a member of the bargaining\nunit. See id. at 861. Instead, we remanded the case for the Board to\nconsider whether, based on the Board's resolution of the two chal-\nlenged ballots, the exclusion of the confidential employee's vote\ncould have affected the union's victory. See id.\n\nThe Board argues that Prudential requires us to uphold its decision\nvalidating the representation election in this case, suggesting, in\nessence, that Prudential stands for the proposition that a new election\nis unnecessary where a proposed bargaining unit has been modified\npost-election, unless we conclude, based on a numerical analysis\nalone, that the election results would have been different had the\nemployees voted on the appropriate bargaining unit. We do not\nbelieve that Prudential stands for such a broad proposition. Instead,\nPrudential stands for the narrower proposition that a new election is\nnot always required where a bargaining unit is modified post-election;\nrather, the court must assess the potential impact of the modification\non several levels. In that decision, for example, when distinguishing\nHamilton Test Systems, we specifically noted that the modified bar-\n\n                    10\n\fgaining unit in Hamilton Test Systems was less than half the size and\n\"`considerably different in character'\" from the proposed bargaining\nunit, while the modified bargaining unit in Prudential was only one\nemployee smaller than the proposed bargaining unit. Id. at 861 (cita-\ntion omitted). Our discussion in Prudential about Hamilton Test\nSystems, then, suggests that, in addition to the closeness of the elec-\ntion results, both the size and the character and scope of the modified\nbargaining unit are appropriate considerations when deciding whether\nan election must be invalidated.\n\nWhen all relevant factors are considered, it is clear that the circum-\nstances in this case differ significantly from those presented to the\ncourt in Prudential. First, the modified bargaining unit in Prudential\ncontained only one less employee than the proposed bargaining unit,\nwhile the modified bargaining unit in this case contains sixteen fewer\nemployees. Second, and more importantly, in this case, there was a\nsupervisory relationship between the LPNs and the other employees,\nand it affected over two-thirds of the employees remaining in the bar-\ngaining unit after the LPNs were excluded. Therefore, while the\nexclusion of only one employee who does not have supervisory\nauthority over other members of the proposed bargaining unit may not\nchange the character and scope of the bargaining unit, as the court\nimplicitly held in Prudential, the exclusion of the LPNs in this case\nwho supervised most of the other employees in the bargaining unit\nfundamentally changed the character and scope of the bargaining unit.\nBecause the circumstances in this case are fundamentally different\nfrom those presented to the court in Prudential , a different conclusion\nis warranted.\n\nIV.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we deny the Board's application for\nenforcement of its bargaining order against Beverly. 2\n_________________________________________________________________\n2 In addition to arguing that the Board abused its discretion in certifying\nthe election results in light of the post-election modification of the bar-\ngaining unit, Beverly argues that the election should be set aside because\nof inappropriate supervisor behavior during the election campaign.\nBecause we conclude that the Board's application for enforcement of its\nbargaining order should be denied on the former ground, we decline to\nconsider the latter.\n\n                    11\n\fENFORCEMENT DENIED.3\n\nDIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\nI would enforce the bargaining order of the National Labor Rela-\ntions Board certifying the election. In formulating procedures for the\nconduct of an election, the Board is entitled to make \"justifiable and\nreasonable adjustment[s] of the democratic process,\" to accommodate\ninterests such as finality and minimizing delay.

In this case the pre-election unit included 82 eligible voters,\nincluding 16 LPNs. The exclusion of the LPNs reduced the size of the\nbargaining unit by approximately twenty percent.

Co. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496800\"><a href=\"/opinion/496800/prudential-insurance-company-of-america-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 859 (4th Cir. 1987). In Prudential, the employees had voted for\nthe union 4-1, with two votes disputed. We held that one of the voters\nwas a confidential employee who could not be a member of the bar-\ngaining unit. Id. at 860. Despite this twenty percent change in the size\nof the unit, the same differential at stake in the present case, we did\nnot order a new election, as the employer requested. Id. at 861.\nInstead, we remanded the case to the NLRB \"to consider the two\nvotes challenged by the Union and not included in the tally\" to estab-\nlish whether the disputed votes and the removal of the confidential\nemployee \"would affect the Union's majority status.\" Id. If the Union\nlost its majority it would \"be necessary to hold a new election in a\nproperly constituted unit. Otherwise, the representation result must\nstand.\" Id. Thus, despite the removal of the confidential employee\nfrom a five member unit, a potential loss of 20 percent, we held that\na new election was not automatically required.\n\nThe majority, citing Sears, places significant weight on the fact that\nthe unit size approved by the Board was smaller than that voted on\nby the employees, just as it was in NLRB v. Parsons School of Design,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471775\"><a href=\"/opinion/471775/national-labor-relations-board-v-parsons-school-of-design-a-division-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1986)(invalidating the election procedures). In\nParsons, however, the election was extremely close and the court\nemphasized that the character and scope of the unit had been signifi-\ncantly altered. Parsons, 793 F.2d at 504. Neither of these factors are\n\n                     13\n\fpresent here. Furthermore, though it may be true that \"a smaller bar-\ngaining unit may be less attractive to potential union members\nbecause of reduced bargaining power,\" Sears , 957 F.2d at 57, I see\nno reason why the opposite may not be true as well. Some union\nmembers may prefer smaller units that better represent their specific\ninterests, or they may prefer to separate themselves from other\nemployees who do not perform similar work, earn equivalent pay, or\notherwise share their community of interests.\n\nThe second Sears factor focuses on the change in character and\nscope of the unit before and after modification:\n\n          This factor requires consideration of the similarity or dis-\n          similarity of job classifications between the original and\n          final units and the chance that the ultimate unit split an oth-\n          erwise unified workforce. . . . If the new composition of the\n          unit excludes workers performing under conditions similar\n          to those already included in the unit, employees are more\n          likely to have voted differently because they may feel that\n          their individual interests cannot be best represented by a\n          group consisting of diverse, potentially adverse interests.\n\nSears, 957 F.2d at 57-58 (citations omitted).\n\nIn the present case, the Board found that \"the scope and character\nof the unit has not changed to any significant extent, and the unit\nremains the service and maintenance unit petitioned-for originally.\" In\nmy view, although I recognize that it is a close question, the fact that\nthere is no evidence that the LPNs had greater bargaining power than\nthe other unit members as well as the large margin of victory provide\nsufficient evidentiary support for these findings.\n\nBeverly argues to the contrary, asserting that because the LPNs\nsupervised approximately half of the members of the bargaining unit,\nthe LPNs' removal is very significant and would alter the vote. In\nmaking this contention, the company relies heavily on the Second\nCircuit's decision in Parsons. In Parsons, both full-time and part-time\nfaculty had originally voted for the union but the court subsequently\nremoved the full-time faculty from the unit. This action was held to\nhave significantly altered the unit because the\"full-time faculty\n\n                    14\n\femployees excluded from the unit, while comparatively few in num-\nber, are particularly important to the school and carry great weight in\nall matters affecting it.\" Parsons, 793 F.2d at 507. Because \"the elec-\ntion was a very close one\" and \"the part-time instructors may have\nfeared insufficient strength in a unit comprising less than all of the\nfaculty,\" the Second Circuit ordered a new election. Id. at 508.\n\nAlthough there are similarities between this case and Parsons,\nthere are two critical differences. First, the remaining employees in\nthe bargaining unit at issue in the case at hand are all classified as\nfull-time. There is no evidence of a bargaining power differential\nbetween the LPNs and the other Beverly employees like that between\nthe full-time and part-time faculty at issue in Parsons. Second, the\nelection in the present case was not nearly as close as that in Parsons,\nwhere a vote change by \"only four of the 99 part-time instructors who\nvoted for the Union\" would have changed the result of the election.\nId. at 508. Here, even assuming that all 16 LPNs voted for the union,\nthe margin of victory would still be 39-22.\n\nThe final factor addressed under the Sears test is the margin of vic-\ntory in the election. \"A narrow victory heightens the need to scruti-\nnize the election process to ensure that votes would not change with\na more fully informed electorate. [Parsons , 793 F.2d at 507]. This\nfactor must be observed in combination with the two other factors\naddressed above in order to see if the concerns uncovered in examin-\ning the other factors would have led to a vote change sufficient to\nalter the election outcome.\" Sears, 957 F.2d at 58 (emphasis added).\n\nThe purpose of this third factor is to weigh the potential votes lost\nthrough the change in the size, scope, and character of the unit against\nthe margin of victory for the union. In instances where the margin of\nvictory is small, any change in the size of the unit or character may\nnecessitate a new election. See Parsons, 793 F.2d at 508 (noting that\nif \"four of the 99 part-time instructors\" changed their vote, union\nwould lose); Lorimar Productions, 771 F.2d at 1302 (\"The vote was\nso close that the union would have lost had one employee voted dif-\nferently.\"); Hamilton Test Systems, 743 F.2d at 141 (\"A change of one\nvote from union to non-union would have altered the outcome of the\nelection.\"); Monongahela Power Co. v.

Even assuming that all 16 LPNs voted for the union,\nan assumption with no support in the record, the margin would still\nbe 39-22. In weighing this margin of victory with the other two fac-\ntors, it seems to me that the Board did not abuse its discretion by con-\ncluding that the exclusion of the LPNs would not change the votes of\nthe employees in a new election. Beverly is unable to cite a single\ncase in which a court ordered a new election or refused to abide by\nthe Board's decision not to do so when the margin of the original\nunion victory was as great as that in this case. As the majority recog-\nnizes, the National Labor Relations Board \"enjoys broad latitude to\ndevelop and implement the procedure for certification of elections.\"\nAnte at 9. Given the margin of victory, I cannot agree with the major-\nity that the Board exceeded that broad authority and abused its discre-\ntion.\n\n                    16\n\f</pre>",
