(CR: 699-707). Trial Court granted\n\nHerbert’s Motion for Judgment No Obstante Veridicto, dismissing Randall’s\n\nclaims as to both Herbert and Walker and ordering that Randall “take nothing as a\n\nresult of this suit.” (CR 739). This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f                            ISSUE PRESENTED\n\n1. Was there sufficient evidence presented at trial to support the Jury’s verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\f                            STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nA.    Oral Agreement of Drilling Wells in Exchange for Drilling Rig\n\n      Randall entered into an oral agreement with Walker for the drilling of three\n\ngood water wells on Randall’s property. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 60:8-61:24; and 115:15-\n\n22). Randall testified that Walker agreed to drill Randall three good wells in\n\nconsideration for the title for the drilling rig owned by Randall. (Id; R.R. Vol. 3, at\n\np. 179:25-180:20). Randall was to pay the expenses and Walker was to use\n\nRandall’s drilling rig to drill the wells. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 61:22-24). On cross\n\nexamination, Randall discussed other terms which were included by him and\n\nWalker through the ongoing negotiations during the work of drilling the three\n\nwells. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 119:4-19). These other terms included:\n\n      a.      Walker would drill the wells to two-hundred and fifty feet deep (R.R.\n\n             Vol. 3, at p. 119:4-14; 121:6-14);\n\n      b.     Walker could use Randall’s drilling rig to drill the wells (R.R. Vol. 3,\n\n             at p. 179:25-180:17);\n\n      b.     Walker would set the tanks and pumps in the wells (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n             120:19-121:5); and\n\n      c.     The wells would produce good water (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 121:6-14),\n\n             which was defined as potable water. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 117:10-14).\n\n      Randall testified that these terms were all agreed to by Walker. (R.R. Vol. 3,\n                                          3\n\fat p. 60:8-61:7; 115:15-22; and 123:6-14;). The jury saw four color photos\n\nshowing the finished wells with tanks on slabs of concrete. (R.R. Vol. 7, at p.\n\n59,60, 62, and 66).\n\n      Walker testified that:\n\n       1) he operated the drilling rig on Randall’s property (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n      170:16-18);\n\n      2) he and his sons were responsible for the correct drilling of the three wells\n\n      (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 181:6-10);\n\n      3) he filled out well reports for the three wells, listing himself as the licensed\n\n      driller (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 170:7-15); and\n\n      4) the reports were filed with the State of Texas. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 170:7-\n\n      15).\n\nBut, Walker denied that he and Randall had an agreement to drill the wells. (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 166:4-19).\n\n      Randall testified that he and Walker had a prior history of oral contracts in\n\nwhich payment was then made to “Walker Water Well Service” for work Walker\n\nperformed for Randall. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 58:4-5). The check showing the course\n\nof dealings between Randall and Walker was admitted as evidence in the trial.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 7, at p. 5).\n\n\n                                           4\n\fB.    Breach of the Oral Agreement\n\n      1. The First Well Produced Sandy Orange Water\n\n      Randall testified that the first of the three wells was drilled by Walker and\n\nhis two sons, Adam and Thomas Walker, while Randall was out of town. (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 64:4-13). Walker failed to reach 250 feet with the first well. (R.R. Vol.\n\n3, at p. 64:13-14).\n\n      Randall described the water quality of the first well as being “terrible.” (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 65:1-21). The water from the first well was orange and full of sand and\n\nbegan to ruin Randall’s plumbing fixtures. Id. Walker stated that he could not\n\ncontradict Randall’s testimony as to the water quality of the first well. (R.R. Vol. 3,\n\nat p. 170:24-171:6).\n\nRandall’s expert witness as to water well drilling practices and water well quality,\n\nThomas Frist (“Frist”), opined that the water from the first well was full of iron,\n\nharmful to plants, animals and humans, and non-potable. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n186:10-16 and 195:21-24).\n\n      2.     The Second Well Produced Sandy Water\n\n      The second well was drilled to only two hundred and thirty feet, again\n\nfalling short of the agreed 250 feet. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 66:22-25). Randall testified\n\nthat the water produced was full of sand. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 67:21-68:3). The sand\n\nwas so bad it destroyed the first water pump. Id. Frist also testified that he found\n                                          5\n\fsand in the water from well two. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 187:2-8). In Frist’s expert\n\nopinion, there should not be sand in the well water. Id.\n\n      3.     The Third Well Produced Sandy and “Blackish” Water\n\n      Randall testified that the water coming from the third well was sandy, dirty,\n\nand blackish. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 69:18-70:6). Randall recalled that if the water sat,\n\nit would pump out stinky, nasty water with a black residue. Id. He asserted that this\n\nwas not good water. Id. Frist testified that the water produced by well number three\n\ncontained a level of sand not contained in good water. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 186:2-8).\n\n      4.     Randall Kept His End of the Agreement\n\n      Herbert testified that he used Randall’s drilling rig on Randall’s property.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 180:10-20). Herbert also testified that the drilling rig, including\n\nits title, was transferred in exchange for the drilling of the wells. Id. Randall\n\ntestified that he spent $9,596.06 on the expenses for the construction of the three\n\nwells. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 113:15-21).\n\nC.    Randall was Damaged by Walker’s Breach\n\n      Randall testified that the wells drilled for him by Walker were of no value.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 71:6-13). He also testified that the market value of the title of the\n\ndrilling rig Randall transferred to Walker was $80,000.00. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 61:8-\n\n21). Herbert agreed that the drilling rig was paid in exchange for the three wells\n\ndrilled. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 180:10-20). Randall testified that he was seeking\n                                           6\n\fdamages of the value of the drilling rig and the expenses paid, totaling $89,596.06.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 114:6-17).\n\n      Randall further testified that a demand for Walker to fix the wells was made,\n\nbut Walker never returned to fix them. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 115:4-8). He testified that\n\nWalker paid no amount towards the balance of the damages suffered. Id. Randall\n\ntestified that he was required to hire attorneys to help and was seeking his\n\nattorney’s fees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 114:18-115:3). Randall’s Attorney testified that\n\nthe reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees through trial in Randall’s case\n\namounted to $30,845.00. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 210:5-211:13). Walker elected not to\n\ncross-examine Randall’s attorney as to the reasonable and necessary attorney’s\n\nfees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 212:4-10). The jury rendered a verdict in Randall’s favor.\n\n(C.R., at p. 702-707).\n\nD.    Jury Verdict for Randall Disregarded\n\n      On June 1, 2015, the trial court granted Defendant’s Herbert Walker’s\n\nMotion for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto (“JNOV”) (C.R., at p. 709-711),\n\noverturning the jury’s verdict for Randall and rendered a take nothing judgment\n\nagainst Randall for all of his claims against all defendants. (C.R., at p. 739). The\n\nJNOV was filed solely by Herbert, not WWW. (C.R., at p. 709-711). For the sake\n\nof efficiency, the jury questions and the objections raised to each are jointly laid\n\nout along with Randall’s response in the Arguments below.\n                                          7\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nIssue: Was there sufficient Evidence to Uphold the Jury’s Verdict\n\n      Evidence of the offer, acceptance, and terms of the agreement were placed\n\nbefore the jury. As is common in contested fights over oral contracts, the\n\nsupporting evidence is found in the witness testimony, in the actions of the parties,\n\nand in documentation of the actions of the parties. Both parties agree that three\n\nwells were drilled on Randall’s property by Walker and his sons. Both parties\n\nagree that the drilling rig and title were delivered as consideration for the drilling\n\nof those three wells. Acceptance of the terms of the oral agreements can be\n\nimputed to Walker by the jury through Walker’s actions in light of the\n\ncircumstances. There is sufficient evidence to uphold the jury’s findings in\n\nRandall’s, Frist’s, and Walker’s testimony. Because there was ample evidence to\n\nuphold the jury’s findings, the trial court’s take nothing judgment must be reversed\n\nand a judgment in line with the jury’s findings rendered.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                        ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    The No Evidence Standard for Attacking Adverse Findings by a Jury\n\n      In reviewing a legal sufficiency challenge, we consider evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the challenged finding and indulge every reasonable inference\n\nthat would support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005).\n\nWe credit favorable evidence if a reasonable fact finder could do so, and disregard\n\ncontrary evidence unless a reasonable fact finder could not do so. Id. at 827. The\n\nevidence is legally sufficient if it would enable a reasonable and fair-minded\n\nperson to reach the finding under review. Id. Evidence is legally insufficient when\n\n(1) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere\n\nscintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact.\n\nId. at 810. The fact finder is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and the\n\nweight to give their testimony. Id. at 819.The court is not a fact finder and may not\n\npass on the credibility of the witnesses or substitute its judgment for that of the\n\ntrier of fact, even if a different conclusion could be reached on the evidence.\n\nMaritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406-07 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      Under the above standards, Randall presented more than sufficient evidence\n\nto uphold the jury’s responses to jury questions one through four.\n                                          9\n\fB.    Question Number One: Existence and Terms of the Agreement\n\n\n      The first jury question was as to the existence of an agreement and the terms\n\nthereto:\n\n      Did Terry Randall, Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well, and Walker\n      Water Well Services, LLC, agree that Herbert J Walker d/b/a Walker Water\n      Well, and Walker Water Well Services, LLC, would drill three water wells\n      to a depth of 250 feet using a drilling rig owned by Terry Randall; that\n      Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well, and Walker Water Well\n      Services, LLC, would set the tanks and the pumps on those wells; and that\n      the wells would produce good water; and that Terry Randall would transfer\n      ownership of his drilling rig to Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well,\n      and Walker Water Well Services, LLC, as payment for the wells?\n\n(C.R., at p. 702). Question number one included an instruction of what evidence\n\nthe Jury could look to for support:\n\n      In deciding whether the parties reached an agreement, you may consider\n      what they said and did in light of the surrounding circumstances, including\n      any earlier course of dealing. You may not consider the parties’ unexpressed\n      thoughts or intentions.\n\nId. The jury returned an answer of “Yes” to question number one. Id.\n\n      1.     Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV challenged question one on the grounds that there was no-\n\nevidence to support the terms contained therein or such terms were contradicted by\n\nRandall. (C.R., at p. 709-10). No attempt was made in the JNOV to demonstrate\n\nwhere the evidence was lacking. Id. Herbert filed “Herbert Walker’s Post-Verdict\n\nBrief” (“Post-Verdict Brief”), which he argues that Randall failed to prove that\n                                        10\n\fthere was a “meeting of the minds as to all essential terms of their agreement.”\n\n(C.R., at p. 726). A discussion of which essential terms are missing is not provided\n\nin the Post-Verdict Brief. (C.R., at p. 724-26).\n\n      Herbert also argues the jury’s answer to question number one should be\n\ndisregarded because a fact was established to the contrary as a matter of law\n\nthrough a judicial admission made during Randall’s testimony. (C.R., at p. 710).\n\nHerbert’s allegation of the existence of a judicial admission regarding question\n\nnumber one will be discussed jointly with a similar accusation as to question\n\nnumber two below.\n\n      At trial, Walker objected to the submission of question number one based\n\nupon a lack of factual and legal sufficiency, but made no objection to the inclusion\n\nof any one particular term or the instruction. (R.R. Vol. 4, at p. 5:6-6:15).\n\n      2. Offer: Randall Testified of the Terms Negotiated Between the Parties\n\n      As described above in paragraph A of the Statement of Facts, Randall\n\ntestified that he and Walker discussed and agreed on each and every term found in\n\nquestion one. See also Appellant’s Table 1 below. Randall and Walker’s testimony\n\nand the exhibits presented were more than a scintilla of evidence of an oral\n\nagreement between the parties and of the terms thereof. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\fAppellant’s Table 1: Testimony and Evidence of Terms in Jury Question One.\n\nTerm of Contract listed in         Support       Citation to Record\nJury Question One\nDrill Three Water Wells            Randall’s     R.R.

Vol. 3, at p. 179:25-\n                                   Testimony     180:20\n\n\n      3. Acceptance: Walker Testified that He Drilled the Wells and\n      Was Responsible for the Correct Drilling of the Wells\n\n      Randall testified that Walker agreed to the terms of the agreement. (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 121:18-22). Notwithstanding Randall’s testimony, Walker’s testimony\n\nalone gave the jury plenty of evidence that Walker agreed to the terms of the\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcontract. The Jury heard undisputed testimony from Walker that the following\n\nactions occurred:\n\n       1) three water wells were drilled by Walker with Randall’s drilling rig (R.R.\n\n      Vol. 3, at p. 170:16-18; and 179:25-180:17);\n\n      2) Walker prepared forms to be filed with the State of Texas declaring\n\n      Herbert to be the licensed driller of those three wells (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n      170:7-18);\n\n      3) Randall’s drilling rig and its title were transferred as consideration for the\n\n      drilling of the three wells (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 179:25-180:20); and\n\n      4) Walker and his sons were responsible for the correct drilling of the three\n\n      wells on Randall’s property. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 181:6-10).\n\n      The jury was instructed to rely upon the actions of Walker when deciding if\n\nhe agreed to the terms negotiated between Walker and Randall. (C.R., at p. 702).\n\nRandall’s testimony that Walker agreed and then began drilling the wells is alone\n\nlegally sufficient evidence when paired with the factual circumstances of the case\n\nto uphold the jury verdict that Walker agreed to the terms of the contract. Regal\n\nFin. Co., Ltd. v. Tex Star Motors, Inc., 355 S.W.3d 595, 603 (Tex.2012). Walker’s\n\ntestimony merely adds layers of support to that testimony which demonstrates that\n\nthe terms were accepted by the parties.\n\n\n                                          13\n\f      4.    Part Performance Under an Agreement May Remove Uncertainty and\n      Establish that a Contract is Enforceable\n\n      Herbert’s argument that the contract is unenforceable due to lack of evidence\n\nof a meeting of the minds as to all essential elements is flawed. Rather, Texas law\n\nprovides that the partial performance of both parties can render an otherwise\n\nuncertain agreement enforceable.\n\n      Whether a particular agreement is an enforceable contract is a question of\n\nlaw reviewed de novo. Fiduciary Fin. Servs. of Sw. Inc. v. Corilant Fin., L.P., 376\n\nS.W.3d 253, 256 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied). To be enforceable, a\n\ncontract must define its essential terms with sufficient detail to allow a court to\n\ndetermine the obligations of the parties. “Essential terms” of a contract may\n\ninclude time of performance, price to be paid, work to be done, service to be\n\nrendered, or property to be transferred. Learners Online, Inc. v. Dallas Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., 333 S.W.3d 636, 643 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.). When an agreement\n\nleaves essential terms open for future negotiation, it is not binding upon the parties\n\nand merely constitutes an agreement to agree. See Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nCity of Fort Worth, 22 S.W.3d 831, 847 (Tex. 2000). However, parties may agree\n\non some terms sufficient to create a contract, leaving other provisions for later\n\nnegotiation. Corilant Fin., L.P., 376 S.W.3d at 256.\n\n      The parties must have a “meeting of the minds” and must communicate\n\n                                         14\n\fconsent to the terms of the agreement. Sadeghi v. Gang, 270 S.W.3d 773, 776\n\n(Tex. App.--Dallas 2008, no pet.). In determining whether there was a “meeting of\n\nthe minds,” and therefore an offer and acceptance, courts use an objective standard,\n\nconsidering what the parties did and said, not their subjective states of mind.\n\nKomet v. Graves, 40 S.W.3d 596, 601 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2001, no pet.).\n\nCourts look to the communications between the parties, as well as the acts and\n\ncircumstances surrounding the communications, in making this determination. Id.\n\n      In an analogous case, a water well driller in Tucker, Texas, disputed that he\n\nagreed to all of the terms of the contract, despite the jury finding as much.\n\nPalestine Water Well Servs., Inc. v. Vance Sand & Rock, Inc., 188 S.W.3d 321,\n\n324 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2006, no pet.). To disprove the meeting of the minds, the\n\nwell driller argued that the oral representations regarding the completed water\n\nwell’s ability to production of a certain gallon per minute (“GPM”) were guesses,\n\nnot guarantees. Id. at 326. The well did not produce at least 200 GPM , despite the\n\ndriller’s verbal assurances. Id. at 324. A verdict was rendered against the driller for\n\nbreach of contract for his failure to drill the well in accordance with the GPM\n\nrequirements of the landowner. Id. The court of appeals held that the testimony of\n\nthe landowner and evidence of actions taken by the parties were both legally and\n\nfactually sufficient for the jury’s finding of a formation of a contract. Id. at 327.\n\n      The partial performance of the parties in this case, including the drilling of\n                                           15\n\fthe wells and paying of the consideration, establishes the contract as enforceable.\n\nIn Crisp Analytical Lab, L.L.C. v. Jakalam Props., Ltd, the Dallas appeals court\n\nreferenced the Second Restatement of Contracts to describe why a partially\n\nperformed contract may remove any uncertainty as to the enforceability of a\n\ncontract. Crisp Analytical Lab, L.L.C., v. Jakalam Props., Ltd, 422 S.W.3d 85, 88\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied). “Part performance under an agreement may\n\nremove uncertainty and establish that a contract is enforceable as a bargain has\n\nbeen formed.” Id., citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 34(2)\n\n(1981).\n\n      Walker testified as to his partial performance under the contract. Although\n\nhe refused to acknowledge a contract existed, the actions he admitted to taking\n\nwere a partial performance of the contract testified to by Randall. See Appellant’s\n\nTable 1.\n\n      The jury was instructed to weigh Walker’s testimony and actions, the\n\nexhibits, and Randall’s testimony when coming to a conclusion as to the existence\n\nof a contract. Because there was testimony by Randall that the terms were\n\ndiscussed with Walker, that Walker agreed with the terms of the contract, and\n\nample evidence that Walker took actions in furtherance of that contract, the Jury\n\nhad sufficient evidence to support their response to question number one. The trial\n\ncourt erred in disregarding the question number one.\n                                        16\n\fC.       Question Number Two: Breach by Walker\n\n         Question number two requested the jury to respond “yes” or “no” to the\n\nquestion “[d]id Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well, and Walker Water\n\nWell Services, LLC fail to comply with the agreement”, referring to the agreement\n\nfound in question number one. (C.R., at p. 703). The jury responded “Yes.” Id.\n\n         1.    Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n         Herbert’s JNOV argued that there was no evidence to support question\n\nnumber two or a fact was established to the contrary to it as a matter of law. (C.R.,\n\nat p. 710). No explanation was given by Herbert in the JNOV as to what fact was\n\nestablished as a matter of law. Id. Herbert also attacked question number two as\n\nbeing immaterial once the court disregards question number one. Id.\n\n         2.   Expert Testified the Well Water was Harmful to Humans and Animals\n         and Full of Sand\n\n         As described above in paragraph B of the Statement of Facts, lay and expert\n\ntestimony was provided to the jury that the wells in question did not produce good\n\nwater and were not drilled to a depth of 250 feet. Walker stated that he could not\n\nchallenge their testimony as to the water quality on well number one. No evidence\n\nwas provided to contradict the testimony or conclusions of Randall or his expert\n\nFrist.\n\n         The evidence laid out above in paragraph B of the Statement of Facts is\n\n                                          17\n\fsufficient to support a jury verdict that Walker did not comply with the terms of the\n\nContract found in question number one. The trial court erred in disregarding the\n\nquestion number two.\n\nD.    Question Number Three: Damages\n\n      Question number three requested damages for the breach of the oral\n\nagreement found in question number two, with the following element of damage\n\nfor the jury’s consideration: “The difference in the value of work as agreed to by\n\nthe parties and the value of the work performed” (C.R., at p. 704). The jury\n\nresponded with the amount “$42,500.00.” Id.\n\n      1.     Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV attacked question number three claiming there was no\n\nevidence to support it or as being immaterial once the court disregards Question\n\nnumber one. (C.R., at p. 710).\n\n      2.     $89,596.06 for Worthless Wells\n\n      Randall testified that he bargained for and paid $89,596.06, including the\n\nvalue of the drilling rig and the materials bought, for the three wells. (R.R. Vol. 3,\n\nat p. 60:22-24). Randall testified that the wells drilled for him by Walker were of\n\nno value. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 71:6-13).\n\n      In Palestine, the well driller contended that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto support the damage award for the breach of contract. Palestine Water Well\n                                          18\n\fServs., Inc., 188 S.W.3d at 324-27. There the evidence presented detailed\n\n$61,289.18 in damages, but only $23,678.08 was awarded. Id. The court noted\n\nthat:\n\n        Water wells that do not produce water as contractually agreed upon have no\n        value to the landowner. We hold that as a matter of law, the well had no\n        value to Vance Sand. Therefore, Vance Sand received no value for the\n        $61,289.18 that it parted with. The $23,678.08 awarded by the jury on\n        Vance Sand's contract cause of action was within the range of up to\n        $61,289.18 that it could have determined “Palestine” was liable for under\n        this contract. It is well established that in resolving damage issues, a jury's\n        finding will be upheld if it is within the range of the testimony regarding the\n        amount of damages incurred.\n\nId. (internal cites omitted). Because the damages awarded on question number two\n\nare within the range of evidence presented at trial, the jury’s award had sufficient\n\nlegal evidence supporting it. The trial court erred in granting the JNOV as to\n\nquestion number three.\n\n        3.    Walker’s Attorney Stated in his Closing Arguments that the Market\n        Value of the Wells was $22,000.00\n\n        In the alternative from the arguments raised above, if this court finds there\n\nwas not sufficient evidence to uphold the jury’s findings that the three well’s\n\nmarket value was at least $42,500.00, this court should find the value was at least\n\n$22,000.00. Walker’s attorney instructed the jury in his closing remarks that the\n\nmarket value of the three wells as bargained for was $22,000.00. (R.R., Vol. 4 at p.\n\n37:22-38:19). This is evidence in the form of an admission against party interest\n\n                                           19\n\fand is legally sufficient evidence for the jury to uphold the jury’s findings up to\n\n$22,000. Id.\n\n      Furthermore, Frist testified that a local well driller informed him that he\n\nwould have drilled the same wells for $22,000.00. (R.R., Vol. 3 at p. 198:12-\n\n199:1). This is further evidence to support the jury’s findings of damages up to\n\n$22,000.00. If this court finds that there was not enough evidence to support the\n\njury’s finding of damages in the amount of $42,500.00, Randall requests the court\n\nreverse and remand a judgment consistent with upholding the jury’s findings in\n\nquestion number three up to $22,000.00.\n\nE.    Question Number Four Attorney’s Fees\n\n      Question number four requested the jury decide the amount of reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees for the services of Randall’s attorneys through trial.\n\n(C.R., at p. 704). The jury responded with the amount “$30,845.00.” Id. During the\n\ntrial, Walker elected not to cross-examine Randall’s attorney as to the reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 212:4-10).\n\n      1.       Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV argued there was no evidence to support question number 4\n\nor it was immaterial once the court disregarded question number one. (C.R., at p.\n\n710). Herbert added a small amount of description to this attack stating that\n\n“[Randall] failed to provide the evidence required by Texas law to support an\n                                          20\n\faward of attorney’s fees.” Id. Herbert’s Post-Verdict Brief offered no further\n\ndiscussion of the “evidence required by Texas law” referred to in his JNOV. (C.R.,\n\nat p. 724-26).\n\n      2.     Uncontested, Reasonable Testimony Established\n             the Attorney’s fees as a Matter of Law\n\n      “[W]here the testimony of an interested witness is not contradicted by any\n\nother witness, or attendant circumstances, and the same is clear, direct, positive,\n\nand free from contradiction, inaccuracies, and circumstances tending to cast\n\nsuspicion thereon, it is taken as true, as a matter of law.” Ragsdale v. Progressive\n\nVoters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 882 (Tex. 1990); see Lofton v. Texas Brine Corp.,\n\n777 S.W.2d 384, 386 (Tex. 1989). This is “especially true where the opposing\n\nparty has the means and opportunity of disproving the testimony, if it is not true,\n\nand fails to do so.” Ragsdale, 801 S.W.2d at 882.\n\n      In determining if attorney’s fees are established as a matter of law, the\n\nreviewing court may look to the following:\n\n             a) whether the opposing party had the means and opportunity of\n\n      disproving or impeaching the testimony and failed to do so (Cullins v.\n\n      Foster, 171 S.W.3d 521, 538-39 (Tex. App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet.\n\n      denied); Brown v. Bank of Galveston, 930 S.W.2d 140, 145 (Tex. App.-\n\n      Houston [14th Dist.] 1996), aff’d, 963 S.W.2d 511 (Tex. 1998),\n\n                                        21\n\f             b) whether the fee is unreasonable in light of the amount involved and\n\n      the results obtained (Midland Western Bldg., L.L.C. v. First Serv. Air\n\n      Conditioning Contractors, Inc., 300 S.W.3d 738, 739 (Tex. 2009)),\n\n             c) whether attorney’s fees billing records were introduced as evidence\n\n      (El Apple I, Ltd. v. Olivas, 370 S.W.3d 757, 761-62 (Tex. 2012); Schlager v.\n\n      Clements, 939 S.W.2d 183, 193 (Tex. App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ\n\n      denied)), or\n\n             d) whether the attorney’s work was even necessary (Rosenblatt v.\n\n      Freedom Life Ins. Co. of Am., 240 S.W.3d 315, 323 (Tex. App.- Houston\n\n      [1st Dist.] 2007)).\n\n      Randall’s attorney testified as to the reasonable and necessary attorney’s\n\nfees incurred, including segregating fees for Breach of Contract. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n210:5-212:10). These fees were necessary and reasonable in light of the injury\n\nsustained, loss of $89,596.06 for three bad wells, and the results obtained, a jury\n\nverdict for $42,500.00. (R.R. Vol. 7, at p. 68; and C.R., at p. 704). Herbert failed to\n\nmake any challenges to the testimony placed before the trier of fact as to the\n\nreasonableness or necessity of those fees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 212:4-10). Because\n\nthe testimony of Randall’s attorney meets the requirements laid out in Ragsdale, it\n\nestablished as a matter of law the reasonableness and necessity of the attorney fees\n\nincurred by Randall.\n                                          22\n\f      3.       Evidence was put before the jury of at least $30,845.00 in reasonable\n               attorney fees.\n\n      In general, the reasonableness and value of attorney’s fees is a question of\n\nfact for the jury’s determination. Bocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex.\n\n1998); Brown, 930 S.W.2d at 145. “The reasonableness of attorney’s fees is\n\nordinarily left to the factfinder, and a reviewing court may not substitute its\n\njudgment for the jury’s.” Smith v. Patrick W.Y. Yam Trust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 546\n\n(Tex. 2009).\n\n      It is Herbert’s burden to show that there is no evidence supporting the Jury’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees. Cale’s Clean Scene Carwash, Inc. v. Hubbard, 76\n\nS.W.3d 784, 786 (Tex. App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) This Court must\n\nfirst examine the record for evidence to support the jury finding while ignoring all\n\nevidence to the contrary. Id.\n\n      Even if the evidence put before the jury failed to establish the attorney’s fees\n\nas a matter of law, there is still some evidence to support the jury’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees. The trial court erred in disregarding the question number four when\n\nattorney’s fees were established as a matter of law, and in the alternative, were\n\nupheld by sufficient credible evidence.\n\nF. Request to Find a Judicial Admission: Raised as to Question One and Two\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV attacked question number one and two claiming there was a\n\n                                          23\n\ffact established to the contrary as a matter of law, or a judicial admission. (C.R., at\n\np. 710).\n\n      As to question number one, the explanation given in the JNOV for this\n\nargument was “[Randall]’s own testimony constitutes a judicial admission that he\n\ndid not an [sic] agreement with [Walker] of the nature asked about in question\n\none.”Id. Herbert’s Post-Verdict Brief offered no further discussion, explanation of\n\nthis argument. (C.R., at p. 724-26).\n\n      As to question number two, no explanation was given in the JNOV or Post\n\nVerdict Brief as to what terms were at issue or where the contradiction lay. Id. No\n\nobjections were made at the time of submission of jury question one or two based\n\nupon the existence of a judicial admission. (R.R. Vol. 4, at p. 5:6-7:7).\n\n      1.     Herbert Cannot Rely on a Judicial Admission\n             that He Failed to Protect\n\n      This court need not reach the issue of whether a judicial admission existed in\n\nthe testimony at trial as Herbert failed to object to the submission of evidence,\n\ntestimony or jury questions because they were contrary to the facts established in a\n\njudicial admission. As such, Herbert cannot rely upon a judicial admission to\n\nretroactively invalidate evidence in support of the jury questions. See Marshall v.\n\nVise, 767 S.W.2d 699, 700 (Tex. 1989); Hurlbut v. Gulf Atlantic Life Ins. Co., 749\n\nS.W.2d 762, 765 (Tex. 1987).\n\n                                          24\n\f      In Hurlbut v. Gulf Atlantic Life Ins. Co., the trial defendant failed to make an\n\nobjection to evidence or testimony during its admission at trial as being contrary to\n\na judicial admission. Hurlbut, 749 S.W.2d at 765. The first mention of a judicial\n\nadmission came in the defendant’s motion for JNOV. Id. The court declared that:\n\n“We need not decide whether plaintiffs' pleadings clearly and unequivocally\n\nconcede the existence of facts amounting to a judicial admission of limitations\n\nbecause defendants did not stand on this alleged admission.” Id. The court further\n\ninstructed the defendant that a “party relying on an admission must protect it by\n\nobjecting to the introduction of evidence contrary to the admission and by\n\nobjecting to the submission of any issue bearing on the fact or facts admitted.” Id.\n\n      Because Herbert failed to raise the issue to the trial court at the time of the\n\nsubmission of the questions, he cannot raise the issue of a judicial admission. The\n\ntrial court erred in relying upon judicial admissions to disregard the jury’s findings.\n\n      2.      Contradictory Testimony is a Quasi-Admission for the Fact Finder to\n              Resolve\n\n      In Herbert’s JNOV, he made an accusation that a fact was established as a\n\nmatter of law or a judicial admission occurred contrary to the findings in question\n\nnumber one.\n\n      A judicial admission is “a formal waiver of proof usually found in pleadings\n\nor the stipulations of the parties.” Mendoza v. Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Underwriters,\n\n                                          25\n\fInc., 606 S.W.2d 692, 694 (Tex.1980). A judicial admission should be\n\ndistinguished from a “quasi-admission,” which is a party's testimonial declaration\n\nthat is contrary to the party's position. See Id.; TX Far West, Ltd. v. Tex. Invs.\n\nMgmt., 127 S.W.3d 295, 308 (Tex. App.—Austin 2004, no pet.). Quasi-admissions\n\nare “merely some evidence, and they are not conclusive upon the admitter.”\n\nMendoza, 606 S.W.2d at 694, citing Harris Cnty. v. Hall, 172 S.W.2d 691, 694-95\n\n(Tex. 1943). The trier of fact must decide what weight to give quasi-admissions.\n\nId.\n\n      A party’s testimonial quasi-admission will preclude recovery if it meets the\n\nrequirements set out in Griffin v. Superior Insurance Co., 338 S.W.2d 415, 419\n\n(Tex.1960) and United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Carr, 242 S.W.2d 224,\n\n229 (Tex.Civ.App.—San Antonio 1951, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      Herbert made no attempt to reveal the judicial admission, or “fact\n\nestablished contrary as a matter of law” or overcome the “hypothesis of a mere\n\nmistake or slip of the tongue.” Mendoza, 606 S.W.2d at 694. Herbert failed to\n\nuphold his burden before the trial court to prove that a fact was established as a\n\nmatter of law or that a judicial admission occurred. Without any guidance from\n\nHerbert, the trial court erred in disregarding question number one and two based\n\nupon a judicial admission or fact established as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                         26\n\fG.    Walker Water Wells did not file any Post-trial Motions.\n\n      WWW did not file any challenges to the jury findings. (C.R., at p. 709 and\n\n724). The trial court’s judgment states that the “Defendants moved” for the JNOV\n\nand that the “Defendants’ motion should be granted.” The Judgment then rendered\n\nwas in favor of all Defendants therein, both Herbert and WWW. (C.R., at p. 739).\n\n      The trial court erred in issuing a take nothing judgment as to all parties and\n\nall claims as WWW made no objections to the jury responses and filed no motions\n\nto which the trial court could grant. The trial court’s issuance of a take noting\n\njudgment granted relief to a party that neither request it nor upheld their burden of\n\nproving that they deserved it.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      There was more than sufficient evidence presented in the trial to uphold the\n\njury’s response to questions one through four. None of these questions were\n\nimmaterial to the claim before the jury. Herbert failed to show that a judicial\n\nadmission occurred or protect that judicial admission by using it to object to the\n\nsubmission of evidence or jury questions. Since the jury returned a clear verdict,\n\nfurther fact finding is unnecessary. Appellant asks that this court reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment and render a final judgment for Appellant in accordance with the\n\njury’s findings. (C.R. at p. 699-707). Miller v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 568\n\nS.W.2d 648, 652 (Tex. 1977)\n                                         27\n\f                                     PRAYER\n\n      Appellant, Terry Randall, prays that this Court grant his Appeal and reverse\n\nthe Trial Court’s Judgment and render a judgment in accordance with the jury’s\n\nfindings in Appellant’s favor of $42,500.00 in damages; attorney’s fees of\n\n$30,845.00; costs of court and appeal; pre-trial interest, and post-judgment interest\n\nas provided by law and for any other award Appellant is due in equity.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       THE WELSCHER LAW FIRM\n\n\n                                       /s/ S.

(CR: 699-707). Trial Court granted\n\nHerbert’s Motion for Judgment No Obstante Veridicto, dismissing Randall’s\n\nclaims as to both Herbert and Walker and ordering that Randall “take nothing as a\n\nresult of this suit.” (CR 739). This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          1\n\f                            ISSUE PRESENTED\n\n1.

Oral Agreement of Drilling Wells in Exchange for Drilling Rig\n\n      Randall entered into an oral agreement with Walker for the drilling of three\n\ngood water wells on Randall’s property. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 60:8-61:24; and 115:15-\n\n22). Randall testified that Walker agreed to drill Randall three good wells in\n\nconsideration for the title for the drilling rig owned by Randall. (Id; R.R. Vol. 3, at\n\np. 179:25-180:20). Randall was to pay the expenses and Walker was to use\n\nRandall’s drilling rig to drill the wells. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 61:22-24). On cross\n\nexamination, Randall discussed other terms which were included by him and\n\nWalker through the ongoing negotiations during the work of drilling the three\n\nwells. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 119:4-19). These other terms included:\n\n      a.      Walker would drill the wells to two-hundred and fifty feet deep (R.R.\n\n             Vol. 3, at p. 119:4-14; 121:6-14);\n\n      b.     Walker could use Randall’s drilling rig to drill the wells (R.R. Vol. 3,\n\n             at p. 179:25-180:17);\n\n      b.     Walker would set the tanks and pumps in the wells (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n             120:19-121:5); and\n\n      c.     The wells would produce good water (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 121:6-14),\n\n             which was defined as potable water. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 117:10-14).\n\n      Randall testified that these terms were all agreed to by Walker. (R.R. Vol. 3,\n                                          3\n\fat p. 60:8-61:7; 115:15-22; and 123:6-14;). The jury saw four color photos\n\nshowing the finished wells with tanks on slabs of concrete. (R.R. Vol. 7, at p.\n\n59,60, 62, and 66).\n\n      Walker testified that:\n\n       1) he operated the drilling rig on Randall’s property (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n      170:16-18);\n\n      2) he and his sons were responsible for the correct drilling of the three wells\n\n      (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 181:6-10);\n\n      3) he filled out well reports for the three wells, listing himself as the licensed\n\n      driller (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 170:7-15); and\n\n      4) the reports were filed with the State of Texas. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 170:7-\n\n      15).\n\nBut, Walker denied that he and Randall had an agreement to drill the wells. (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 166:4-19).\n\n      Randall testified that he and Walker had a prior history of oral contracts in\n\nwhich payment was then made to “Walker Water Well Service” for work Walker\n\nperformed for Randall. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 58:4-5). The check showing the course\n\nof dealings between Randall and Walker was admitted as evidence in the trial.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 7, at p. 5).\n\n\n                                           4\n\fB.    Breach of the Oral Agreement\n\n      1. The First Well Produced Sandy Orange Water\n\n      Randall testified that the first of the three wells was drilled by Walker and\n\nhis two sons, Adam and Thomas Walker, while Randall was out of town. (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 64:4-13). Walker failed to reach 250 feet with the first well. (R.R. Vol.\n\n3, at p. 64:13-14).\n\n      Randall described the water quality of the first well as being “terrible.” (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 65:1-21). The water from the first well was orange and full of sand and\n\nbegan to ruin Randall’s plumbing fixtures. Id. Walker stated that he could not\n\ncontradict Randall’s testimony as to the water quality of the first well. (R.R. Vol. 3,\n\nat p. 170:24-171:6).\n\nRandall’s expert witness as to water well drilling practices and water well quality,\n\nThomas Frist (“Frist”), opined that the water from the first well was full of iron,\n\nharmful to plants, animals and humans, and non-potable. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n186:10-16 and 195:21-24).\n\n      2.     The Second Well Produced Sandy Water\n\n      The second well was drilled to only two hundred and thirty feet, again\n\nfalling short of the agreed 250 feet. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 66:22-25). Randall testified\n\nthat the water produced was full of sand. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 67:21-68:3). The sand\n\nwas so bad it destroyed the first water pump. Id. Frist also testified that he found\n                                          5\n\fsand in the water from well two. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 187:2-8). In Frist’s expert\n\nopinion, there should not be sand in the well water. Id.\n\n      3.     The Third Well Produced Sandy and “Blackish” Water\n\n      Randall testified that the water coming from the third well was sandy, dirty,\n\nand blackish. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 69:18-70:6). Randall recalled that if the water sat,\n\nit would pump out stinky, nasty water with a black residue. Id. He asserted that this\n\nwas not good water. Id. Frist testified that the water produced by well number three\n\ncontained a level of sand not contained in good water. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 186:2-8).\n\n      4.     Randall Kept His End of the Agreement\n\n      Herbert testified that he used Randall’s drilling rig on Randall’s property.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 180:10-20). Herbert also testified that the drilling rig, including\n\nits title, was transferred in exchange for the drilling of the wells. Id. Randall\n\ntestified that he spent $9,596.06 on the expenses for the construction of the three\n\nwells. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 113:15-21).\n\nC.    Randall was Damaged by Walker’s Breach\n\n      Randall testified that the wells drilled for him by Walker were of no value.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 71:6-13). He also testified that the market value of the title of the\n\ndrilling rig Randall transferred to Walker was $80,000.00. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 61:8-\n\n21). Herbert agreed that the drilling rig was paid in exchange for the three wells\n\ndrilled. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 180:10-20). Randall testified that he was seeking\n                                           6\n\fdamages of the value of the drilling rig and the expenses paid, totaling $89,596.06.\n\n(R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 114:6-17).\n\n      Randall further testified that a demand for Walker to fix the wells was made,\n\nbut Walker never returned to fix them. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 115:4-8). He testified that\n\nWalker paid no amount towards the balance of the damages suffered. Id. Randall\n\ntestified that he was required to hire attorneys to help and was seeking his\n\nattorney’s fees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 114:18-115:3). Randall’s Attorney testified that\n\nthe reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees through trial in Randall’s case\n\namounted to $30,845.00. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 210:5-211:13). Walker elected not to\n\ncross-examine Randall’s attorney as to the reasonable and necessary attorney’s\n\nfees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 212:4-10). The jury rendered a verdict in Randall’s favor.\n\n(C.R., at p. 702-707).\n\nD.    Jury Verdict for Randall Disregarded\n\n      On June 1, 2015, the trial court granted Defendant’s Herbert Walker’s\n\nMotion for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto (“JNOV”) (C.R., at p. 709-711),\n\noverturning the jury’s verdict for Randall and rendered a take nothing judgment\n\nagainst Randall for all of his claims against all defendants. (C.R., at p. 739). The\n\nJNOV was filed solely by Herbert, not WWW. (C.R., at p. 709-711). For the sake\n\nof efficiency, the jury questions and the objections raised to each are jointly laid\n\nout along with Randall’s response in the Arguments below.\n                                          7\n\f                       SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\nIssue: Was there sufficient Evidence to Uphold the Jury’s Verdict\n\n      Evidence of the offer, acceptance, and terms of the agreement were placed\n\nbefore the jury. As is common in contested fights over oral contracts, the\n\nsupporting evidence is found in the witness testimony, in the actions of the parties,\n\nand in documentation of the actions of the parties. Both parties agree that three\n\nwells were drilled on Randall’s property by Walker and his sons. Both parties\n\nagree that the drilling rig and title were delivered as consideration for the drilling\n\nof those three wells. Acceptance of the terms of the oral agreements can be\n\nimputed to Walker by the jury through Walker’s actions in light of the\n\ncircumstances. There is sufficient evidence to uphold the jury’s findings in\n\nRandall’s, Frist’s, and Walker’s testimony. Because there was ample evidence to\n\nuphold the jury’s findings, the trial court’s take nothing judgment must be reversed\n\nand a judgment in line with the jury’s findings rendered.\n\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\f                        ARGUMENTS AND AUTHORITIES\n\nA.    The No Evidence Standard for Attacking Adverse Findings by a Jury\n\n      In reviewing a legal sufficiency challenge, we consider evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the challenged finding and indulge every reasonable inference\n\nthat would support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822 (Tex. 2005).\n\nWe credit favorable evidence if a reasonable fact finder could do so, and disregard\n\ncontrary evidence unless a reasonable fact finder could not do so. Id. at 827. The\n\nevidence is legally sufficient if it would enable a reasonable and fair-minded\n\nperson to reach the finding under review. Id. Evidence is legally insufficient when\n\n(1) there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact; (2) the court is barred by\n\nrules of law or evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a\n\nvital fact; (3) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere\n\nscintilla; or (4) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the vital fact.\n\nId. at 810. The fact finder is the sole judge of the credibility of witnesses and the\n\nweight to give their testimony. Id. at 819.The court is not a fact finder and may not\n\npass on the credibility of the witnesses or substitute its judgment for that of the\n\ntrier of fact, even if a different conclusion could be reached on the evidence.\n\nMaritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1572837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1572837/maritime-overseas-corp-v-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">971</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 406-07 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      Under the above standards, Randall presented more than sufficient evidence\n\nto uphold the jury’s responses to jury questions one through four.\n                                          9\n\fB.    Question Number One: Existence and Terms of the Agreement\n\n\n      The first jury question was as to the existence of an agreement and the terms\n\nthereto:\n\n      Did Terry Randall, Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well, and Walker\n      Water Well Services, LLC, agree that Herbert J Walker d/b/a Walker Water\n      Well, and Walker Water Well Services, LLC, would drill three water wells\n      to a depth of 250 feet using a drilling rig owned by Terry Randall; that\n      Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well, and Walker Water Well\n      Services, LLC, would set the tanks and the pumps on those wells; and that\n      the wells would produce good water; and that Terry Randall would transfer\n      ownership of his drilling rig to Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well,\n      and Walker Water Well Services, LLC, as payment for the wells?\n\n(C.R., at p. 702). Question number one included an instruction of what evidence\n\nthe Jury could look to for support:\n\n      In deciding whether the parties reached an agreement, you may consider\n      what they said and did in light of the surrounding circumstances, including\n      any earlier course of dealing. You may not consider the parties’ unexpressed\n      thoughts or intentions.\n\nId. The jury returned an answer of “Yes” to question number one. Id.\n\n      1.     Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV challenged question one on the grounds that there was no-\n\nevidence to support the terms contained therein or such terms were contradicted by\n\nRandall. (C.R., at p. 709-10). No attempt was made in the JNOV to demonstrate\n\nwhere the evidence was lacking. Id. Herbert filed “Herbert Walker’s Post-Verdict\n\nBrief” (“Post-Verdict Brief”), which he argues that Randall failed to prove that\n                                        10\n\fthere was a “meeting of the minds as to all essential terms of their agreement.”\n\n(C.R., at p. 726). A discussion of which essential terms are missing is not provided\n\nin the Post-Verdict Brief. (C.R., at p. 724-26).\n\n      Herbert also argues the jury’s answer to question number one should be\n\ndisregarded because a fact was established to the contrary as a matter of law\n\nthrough a judicial admission made during Randall’s testimony. (C.R., at p. 710).\n\nHerbert’s allegation of the existence of a judicial admission regarding question\n\nnumber one will be discussed jointly with a similar accusation as to question\n\nnumber two below.\n\n      At trial, Walker objected to the submission of question number one based\n\nupon a lack of factual and legal sufficiency, but made no objection to the inclusion\n\nof any one particular term or the instruction. (R.R. Vol. 4, at p. 5:6-6:15).\n\n      2. Offer: Randall Testified of the Terms Negotiated Between the Parties\n\n      As described above in paragraph A of the Statement of Facts, Randall\n\ntestified that he and Walker discussed and agreed on each and every term found in\n\nquestion one. See also Appellant’s Table 1 below. Randall and Walker’s testimony\n\nand the exhibits presented were more than a scintilla of evidence of an oral\n\nagreement between the parties and of the terms thereof.

Acceptance: Walker Testified that He Drilled the Wells and\n      Was Responsible for the Correct Drilling of the Wells\n\n      Randall testified that Walker agreed to the terms of the agreement. (R.R.\n\nVol. 3, at p. 121:18-22). Notwithstanding Randall’s testimony, Walker’s testimony\n\nalone gave the jury plenty of evidence that Walker agreed to the terms of the\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcontract. The Jury heard undisputed testimony from Walker that the following\n\nactions occurred:\n\n       1) three water wells were drilled by Walker with Randall’s drilling rig (R.R.\n\n      Vol. 3, at p. 170:16-18; and 179:25-180:17);\n\n      2) Walker prepared forms to be filed with the State of Texas declaring\n\n      Herbert to be the licensed driller of those three wells (R.R. Vol. 3, at p.\n\n      170:7-18);\n\n      3) Randall’s drilling rig and its title were transferred as consideration for the\n\n      drilling of the three wells (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 179:25-180:20); and\n\n      4) Walker and his sons were responsible for the correct drilling of the three\n\n      wells on Randall’s property. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 181:6-10).\n\n      The jury was instructed to rely upon the actions of Walker when deciding if\n\nhe agreed to the terms negotiated between Walker and Randall. (C.R., at p. 702).\n\nRandall’s testimony that Walker agreed and then began drilling the wells is alone\n\nlegally sufficient evidence when paired with the factual circumstances of the case\n\nto uphold the jury verdict that Walker agreed to the terms of the contract.

Although\n\nhe refused to acknowledge a contract existed, the actions he admitted to taking\n\nwere a partial performance of the contract testified to by Randall. See Appellant’s\n\nTable 1.\n\n      The jury was instructed to weigh Walker’s testimony and actions, the\n\nexhibits, and Randall’s testimony when coming to a conclusion as to the existence\n\nof a contract. Because there was testimony by Randall that the terms were\n\ndiscussed with Walker, that Walker agreed with the terms of the contract, and\n\nample evidence that Walker took actions in furtherance of that contract, the Jury\n\nhad sufficient evidence to support their response to question number one. The trial\n\ncourt erred in disregarding the question number one.\n                                        16\n\fC.       Question Number Two: Breach by Walker\n\n         Question number two requested the jury to respond “yes” or “no” to the\n\nquestion “[d]id Herbert J. Walker d/b/a Walker Water Well, and Walker Water\n\nWell Services, LLC fail to comply with the agreement”, referring to the agreement\n\nfound in question number one. (C.R., at p. 703). The jury responded “Yes.” Id.\n\n         1.    Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n         Herbert’s JNOV argued that there was no evidence to support question\n\nnumber two or a fact was established to the contrary to it as a matter of law. (C.R.,\n\nat p. 710). No explanation was given by Herbert in the JNOV as to what fact was\n\nestablished as a matter of law. Id. Herbert also attacked question number two as\n\nbeing immaterial once the court disregards question number one. Id.\n\n         2.   Expert Testified the Well Water was Harmful to Humans and Animals\n         and Full of Sand\n\n         As described above in paragraph B of the Statement of Facts, lay and expert\n\ntestimony was provided to the jury that the wells in question did not produce good\n\nwater and were not drilled to a depth of 250 feet. Walker stated that he could not\n\nchallenge their testimony as to the water quality on well number one. No evidence\n\nwas provided to contradict the testimony or conclusions of Randall or his expert\n\nFrist.\n\n         The evidence laid out above in paragraph B of the Statement of Facts is\n\n                                          17\n\fsufficient to support a jury verdict that Walker did not comply with the terms of the\n\nContract found in question number one. The trial court erred in disregarding the\n\nquestion number two.\n\nD.    Question Number Three: Damages\n\n      Question number three requested damages for the breach of the oral\n\nagreement found in question number two, with the following element of damage\n\nfor the jury’s consideration: “The difference in the value of work as agreed to by\n\nthe parties and the value of the work performed” (C.R., at p. 704). The jury\n\nresponded with the amount “$42,500.00.” Id.\n\n      1.     Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV attacked question number three claiming there was no\n\nevidence to support it or as being immaterial once the court disregards Question\n\nnumber one. (C.R., at p. 710).\n\n      2.     $89,596.06 for Worthless Wells\n\n      Randall testified that he bargained for and paid $89,596.06, including the\n\nvalue of the drilling rig and the materials bought, for the three wells. (R.R. Vol. 3,\n\nat p. 60:22-24). Randall testified that the wells drilled for him by Walker were of\n\nno value. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 71:6-13).\n\n      In Palestine, the well driller contended that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto support the damage award for the breach of contract. Palestine Water Well\n                                          18\n\fServs., Inc., 188 S.W.3d at 324-27. There the evidence presented detailed\n\n$61,289.18 in damages, but only $23,678.08 was awarded. Id. The court noted\n\nthat:\n\n        Water wells that do not produce water as contractually agreed upon have no\n        value to the landowner. We hold that as a matter of law, the well had no\n        value to Vance Sand. Therefore, Vance Sand received no value for the\n        $61,289.18 that it parted with. The $23,678.08 awarded by the jury on\n        Vance Sand's contract cause of action was within the range of up to\n        $61,289.18 that it could have determined “Palestine” was liable for under\n        this contract. It is well established that in resolving damage issues, a jury's\n        finding will be upheld if it is within the range of the testimony regarding the\n        amount of damages incurred.\n\nId. (internal cites omitted). Because the damages awarded on question number two\n\nare within the range of evidence presented at trial, the jury’s award had sufficient\n\nlegal evidence supporting it. The trial court erred in granting the JNOV as to\n\nquestion number three.\n\n        3.    Walker’s Attorney Stated in his Closing Arguments that the Market\n        Value of the Wells was $22,000.00\n\n        In the alternative from the arguments raised above, if this court finds there\n\nwas not sufficient evidence to uphold the jury’s findings that the three well’s\n\nmarket value was at least $42,500.00, this court should find the value was at least\n\n$22,000.00. Walker’s attorney instructed the jury in his closing remarks that the\n\nmarket value of the three wells as bargained for was $22,000.00. (R.R., Vol. 4 at p.\n\n37:22-38:19). This is evidence in the form of an admission against party interest\n\n                                           19\n\fand is legally sufficient evidence for the jury to uphold the jury’s findings up to\n\n$22,000. Id.\n\n      Furthermore, Frist testified that a local well driller informed him that he\n\nwould have drilled the same wells for $22,000.00. (R.R., Vol. 3 at p. 198:12-\n\n199:1). This is further evidence to support the jury’s findings of damages up to\n\n$22,000.00. If this court finds that there was not enough evidence to support the\n\njury’s finding of damages in the amount of $42,500.00, Randall requests the court\n\nreverse and remand a judgment consistent with upholding the jury’s findings in\n\nquestion number three up to $22,000.00.\n\nE.    Question Number Four Attorney’s Fees\n\n      Question number four requested the jury decide the amount of reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees for the services of Randall’s attorneys through trial.\n\n(C.R., at p. 704). The jury responded with the amount “$30,845.00.” Id. During the\n\ntrial, Walker elected not to cross-examine Randall’s attorney as to the reasonable\n\nand necessary attorney’s fees. (R.R. Vol. 3, at p. 212:4-10).\n\n      1.       Disregarded for No Supporting Evidence\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV argued there was no evidence to support question number 4\n\nor it was immaterial once the court disregarded question number one. (C.R., at p.\n\n710). Herbert added a small amount of description to this attack stating that\n\n“[Randall] failed to provide the evidence required by Texas law to support an\n                                          20\n\faward of attorney’s fees.” Id. Herbert’s Post-Verdict Brief offered no further\n\ndiscussion of the “evidence required by Texas law” referred to in his JNOV. (C.R.,\n\nat p. 724-26).\n\n      2.

App.- Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.) This Court must\n\nfirst examine the record for evidence to support the jury finding while ignoring all\n\nevidence to the contrary. Id.\n\n      Even if the evidence put before the jury failed to establish the attorney’s fees\n\nas a matter of law, there is still some evidence to support the jury’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees. The trial court erred in disregarding the question number four when\n\nattorney’s fees were established as a matter of law, and in the alternative, were\n\nupheld by sufficient credible evidence.\n\nF. Request to Find a Judicial Admission: Raised as to Question One and Two\n\n      Herbert’s JNOV attacked question number one and two claiming there was a\n\n                                          23\n\ffact established to the contrary as a matter of law, or a judicial admission. (C.R., at\n\np. 710).\n\n      As to question number one, the explanation given in the JNOV for this\n\nargument was “[Randall]’s own testimony constitutes a judicial admission that he\n\ndid not an [sic] agreement with [Walker] of the nature asked about in question\n\none.”Id. Herbert’s Post-Verdict Brief offered no further discussion, explanation of\n\nthis argument. (C.R., at p. 724-26).\n\n      As to question number two, no explanation was given in the JNOV or Post\n\nVerdict Brief as to what terms were at issue or where the contradiction lay. Id. No\n\nobjections were made at the time of submission of jury question one or two based\n\nupon the existence of a judicial admission. (R.R. Vol. 4, at p. 5:6-7:7).\n\n      1.     Herbert Cannot Rely on a Judicial Admission\n             that He Failed to Protect\n\n      This court need not reach the issue of whether a judicial admission existed in\n\nthe testimony at trial as Herbert failed to object to the submission of evidence,\n\ntestimony or jury questions because they were contrary to the facts established in a\n\njudicial admission. As such, Herbert cannot rely upon a judicial admission to\n\nretroactively invalidate evidence in support of the jury questions.

Gulf Atlantic Life Ins. Co., the trial defendant failed to make an\n\nobjection to evidence or testimony during its admission at trial as being contrary to\n\na judicial admission. Hurlbut, 749 S.W.2d at 765. The first mention of a judicial\n\nadmission came in the defendant’s motion for JNOV. Id. The court declared that:\n\n“We need not decide whether plaintiffs' pleadings clearly and unequivocally\n\nconcede the existence of facts amounting to a judicial admission of limitations\n\nbecause defendants did not stand on this alleged admission.” Id. The court further\n\ninstructed the defendant that a “party relying on an admission must protect it by\n\nobjecting to the introduction of evidence contrary to the admission and by\n\nobjecting to the submission of any issue bearing on the fact or facts admitted.” Id.\n\n      Because Herbert failed to raise the issue to the trial court at the time of the\n\nsubmission of the questions, he cannot raise the issue of a judicial admission. The\n\ntrial court erred in relying upon judicial admissions to disregard the jury’s findings.\n\n      2.      Contradictory Testimony is a Quasi-Admission for the Fact Finder to\n              Resolve\n\n      In Herbert’s JNOV, he made an accusation that a fact was established as a\n\nmatter of law or a judicial admission occurred contrary to the findings in question\n\nnumber one.\n\n      A judicial admission is “a formal waiver of proof usually found in pleadings\n\nor the stipulations of the parties.” Mendoza v. Fidelity & Guar. Ins. Underwriters,\n\n                                          25\n\fInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1732261\"><a href=\"/opinion/1732261/mendoza-v-fidelity-guar-ins-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (Tex.1980).

Herbert failed to\n\nuphold his burden before the trial court to prove that a fact was established as a\n\nmatter of law or that a judicial admission occurred. Without any guidance from\n\nHerbert, the trial court erred in disregarding question number one and two based\n\nupon a judicial admission or fact established as a matter of law.\n\n\n                                         26\n\fG.    Walker Water Wells did not file any Post-trial Motions.\n\n      WWW did not file any challenges to the jury findings. (C.R., at p. 709 and\n\n724). The trial court’s judgment states that the “Defendants moved” for the JNOV\n\nand that the “Defendants’ motion should be granted.” The Judgment then rendered\n\nwas in favor of all Defendants therein, both Herbert and WWW. (C.R., at p. 739).\n\n      The trial court erred in issuing a take nothing judgment as to all parties and\n\nall claims as WWW made no objections to the jury responses and filed no motions\n\nto which the trial court could grant. The trial court’s issuance of a take noting\n\njudgment granted relief to a party that neither request it nor upheld their burden of\n\nproving that they deserved it.\n\n                                 CONCLUSION\n\n      There was more than sufficient evidence presented in the trial to uphold the\n\njury’s response to questions one through four. None of these questions were\n\nimmaterial to the claim before the jury. Herbert failed to show that a judicial\n\nadmission occurred or protect that judicial admission by using it to object to the\n\nsubmission of evidence or jury questions. Since the jury returned a clear verdict,\n\nfurther fact finding is unnecessary. Appellant asks that this court reverse the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment and render a final judgment for Appellant in accordance with the\n\njury’s findings. (C.R. at p. 699-707). Miller v.
