Ginsburg, United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia,\nsitting by designation.\n\f              Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 2 of 30\n\n\n      Fred Dalton Brooks is currently incarcerated in the Special Management\n\nUnit (“SMU”) at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison (“GDCP”) in\n\nJackson, Georgia. He has brought two Eighth Amendment claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983: one against Warden Carl Humphrey, Deputy Warden William Powell,\n\nDeputy Warden June Bishop, and SMU Unit Manager James McMillan stemming\n\nfrom injuries he sustained during a prison riot; and another against only Deputy\n\nWarden Powell based on the conditions of his confinement at Spalding County\n\nHospital following the riot.\n\n      Brooks alleges that within days of being placed in the SMU, he received\n\nthreats of physical and sexual assault from the inmate in the adjacent cell. He\n\nreported these threats but no action was taken. The cell doors in the SMU were\n\nknown to open unintentionally. One day, all 32 doors in his SMU dormitory\n\nopened simultaneously, a riot ensued, and he was brutally attacked by the inmate\n\nwho had threatened him. He was taken to the hospital for three days, where he was\n\nplaced in maximum-security restraints. He was given medicine that gave him\n\nloose stools, but the guard refused to lower his waist-chains so he could defecate.\n\nHe was forced to defecate in his jumpsuit for two days and sit in his own\n\nexcrement, during which time the guard laughed and taunted him. Brooks brought\n\ndeliberate indifference claims relating to both incidents in the United States\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f               Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 3 of 30\n\n\nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The district court dismissed\n\nboth.\n\n        After thorough review, we affirm the dismissal of Brooks’s failure to protect\n\nclaim arising out of the prison riot, but reverse as to his claim that his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights were violated by his alleged mistreatment at the hospital.\n\nBrooks did not adequately allege a substantial risk of serious harm in the period\n\nleading up the prison riot. However, he did adequately plead an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation arising out of his three-day hospital stay. Moreover, as to\n\nthe claim that Brooks had been confined in conditions lacking in basic sanitation,\n\nDeputy Warden Powell is not entitled to qualified immunity. He was put on fair\n\nnotice both by our caselaw and the knowledge that forcing a prisoner to soil\n\nhimself over a two-day period while chained in a hospital bed creates an obvious\n\nhealth risk and is an affront to human dignity.\n\n        Because Brooks has not alleged any physical injury resulting from his\n\nhospital stay, under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), he\n\ncannot recover compensatory or punitive damages. We do hold today, however,\n\nthat Brooks can proceed with his claim for nominal damages for a violation of his\n\nEighth Amendment rights, and we remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            I.\n\n\n                                            3\n\f              Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 4 of 30\n\n\n      Brooks’s amended complaint alleged the following essential facts. Brooks\n\nwas placed in the Special Management Unit on February 7, 2012, under the direct\n\norders of Humphrey, Powell, and Bishop. The SMU has six dormitories, each of\n\nwhich contains 32 individual cells. Brooks’s cell was located in the E-dorm,\n\nadjacent to a cell occupied by inmate Tremayne Watson. Within days of Brooks’s\n\narrival, Watson allegedly threatened to physically attack and sexually assault him.\n\n(Brooks was, at the time, 64 years old; five feet, nine inches tall; and 155 pounds.)\n\nDespite being in a separate cell from Watson, Brooks feared for his safety. He\n\ngave “detailed notes” of Watson’s threats to Humphrey, Powell, Bishop, and\n\nMcMillan. Brooks was not moved from his cell.\n\n      On February 29, 2012, all 32 doors in the E-dorm opened simultaneously\n\nwhile a maintenance man and officer were in the control booth, and a violent riot\n\nbroke out. Watson attacked Brooks: he put him in a chokehold, punched him in\n\nthe face, and beat him over the head with a ten-pound food tray, leaving Brooks\n\nwith serious wounds, broken teeth, and a concussion. Watson then dragged Brooks\n\non his hands and knees into Brooks’s cell and forced Brooks to perform oral sex.\n\nAfter the riot was quelled, Brooks was initially taken to the prison infirmary for\n\ntreatment, but his injuries were serious enough to require that he be transferred to\n\nSpalding County Hospital.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015        Page: 5 of 30\n\n\n       Brooks remained in the hospital for three days. Throughout his stay, Brooks\n\nwas shackled with leg irons and maximum-security waist-chain handcuffs. He was\n\nguarded at all times by Deputy Warden Powell and three other correctional\n\nofficers. He received medicine that “caused [his] bowels to have the liquidity of\n\nwater.” During his second day at the hospital, Brooks began asking and then\n\npleading with Powell to allow him to use the toilet. Powell refused to temporarily\n\nlower Brooks’s waist-chains so he could defecate. Instead, Brooks was forced to\n\nsoil his jumpsuit for the remainder of his stay in the hospital. Powell and the\n\ncorrectional officers “laughed and made fun of” Brooks during this ordeal. 1\n\n       The prison officials moved to dismiss the complaint and Brooks responded.\n\nIn his Response, Brooks alleged for the first time that “the opening of cell doors,\n\neven multiple cell doors[,] in the SMU occurs regularly and is known by all the\n\nDefendants.” He added that “multiple prisoners can sometimes get out of their\n\ncells simultaneously.” Brooks also claimed that “most of the inmates housed in\n\n[the] SMU have been put there because they have committed acts of violence . . .\n\nin the prison system,” and that it was a “well known fact” that “Watson [was] the\n\nmost violent and troublesome inmate in [the] SMU.”\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Although it does not form a part of his § 1983 claim, Brooks also alleged that Powell and the\nother officers refused to uncuff one of Brooks’s hands so he could eat. Instead, they told him, “If\nyou want to eat it bad enough, lick it off the tray like a dog.” Brooks was then forced to lick the\nfood off his tray while Powell and other officers laughed and ridiculed him.\n                                                5\n\f              Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 6 of 30\n\n\n      On July 18, 2013, the magistrate judge entered a Report recommending that\n\nthe Motions to Dismiss be granted in their entirety. As for the failure to protect\n\nclaim, the magistrate judge concluded that Brooks’s allegations did not suggest\n\nthat the defendants had subjective knowledge of a strong likelihood that Brooks\n\nwould be subject to an attack in prison. The court noted that the complaint had not\n\nalleged that Brooks and Watson had ever been outside their cells simultaneously,\n\nor that Watson “otherwise had the opportunity to carry out the threats.” The\n\nmagistrate judge also reasoned that the failure to move Brooks to another cell\n\n(farther from Watson) “amount[ed] only to negligence,” not deliberate\n\nindifference. As for Brooks’s hospital treatment claim, the magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that Powell was protected by qualified immunity because “the facts\n\nalleged [did] not involve a risk to Plaintiff’s health or safety,” and, therefore, it was\n\nnot clearly established that Powell’s conduct violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\n      On August 8, 2013, Brooks moved for reconsideration of the magistrate\n\njudge’s Report and Recommendation. The district court treated the motion as an\n\nobjection to the magistrate’s Report, and construed the new factual allegations as a\n\nsecond Motion to Amend. Brooks conceded that he “did not allege that\n\nDefendants could have foreseen . . . that the maintenance man would open all the\n\ncell doors” in the SMU. However, he maintained that the defendants “knew that\n\nmultiple cell door openings ‘could’ occur” because “similar cell door openings\n\n\n                                            6\n\f              Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 7 of 30\n\n\nhave occurred on prior occasions in [the] SMU.” He claimed that “[t]here have\n\nbeen numerous instances of inmates being able to get out of their cells without\n\nauthorization.” As for his treatment at the hospital, Brooks reiterated that he was\n\n“forced to lie in his own excrement during his entire hospitalization,” thereby\n\ndirectly exposing him to a significant health risk. Notably, Brooks did not allege\n\nthat he sustained any physical injury as a result. Finally, he also claimed that\n\nPowell “refused to allow the nursing staff to clean” Brooks’s body and refused to\n\nallow him to use an adult diaper.\n\n      The district court denied Brooks’s re-styled Motion to Amend as “futile”\n\nbecause “[e]ven with these new allegations [he] fail[ed] to allege colorable Eighth\n\nAmendment claims for the same reasons stated in the [magistrate judge’s]\n\nRecommendation.”\n\n      Brooks timely appealed and was appointed counsel by this Court.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; we accept all factual\n\nallegations as true and consider them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n\nStarship Enters. of Atlanta, Inc. v. Coweta Cnty., 708 F.3d 1243, 1252 (11th Cir.\n\n2013). We review the denial of a motion to amend for an abuse of discretion, but\n\nwhether the motion is futile is a question of law that we review de novo. Smith v.\n\n\n                                           7\n\f              Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 8 of 30\n\n\nFla. Dep’t of Corr., 713 F.3d 1059, 1063 (11th Cir. 2013) (per curiam). A district\n\ncourt’s “denial of leave to amend is justified by futility when the complaint as\n\namended is still subject to dismissal.” Hall v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 367 F.3d\n\n1255, 1263 (11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, 169 F.3d\n\n1310, 1320 (11th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation mark omitted)). In determining\n\nwhether a complaint survives Rule 12(b)(6), we ask whether the complaint\n\ncontains “enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). “A claim has facial plausibility\n\nwhen the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the\n\nreasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). “‘Pro se pleadings are held to a less\n\nstringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys’ and are liberally construed.”\n\nBingham v. Thomas, 654 F.3d 1171, 1175 (11th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (quoting\n\nTannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998) (per curiam)).\n\n                                          III.\n\n      Section 1983 creates a private civil rights cause of action for the deprivation\n\nof federal rights by persons acting under color of state law. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. “It\n\nis undisputed that the treatment a prisoner receives in prison and the conditions\n\nunder which he is confined are subject to scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment.”\n\nHelling v. McKinney, 509 U.S. 25, 31 (1993). “The Eighth Amendment imposes a\n\n\n                                           8\n\f              Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 9 of 30\n\n\nduty on prison officials to take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the\n\ninmates.” Caldwell v. Warden, FCI Talladega, 748 F.3d 1090, 1099 (11th Cir.\n\n2014) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 832 (1994)) (alterations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted). “Having incarcerated ‘persons [with]\n\ndemonstrated proclivit[ies] for antisocial criminal, and often violent, conduct,’\n\nhaving stripped them of virtually every means of self-protection and foreclosed\n\ntheir access to outside aid, the government and its officials are not free to let the\n\nstate of nature take its course.” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 833 (alterations in original)\n\n(quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526 (1984)). It has long been\n\nrecognized that, in this vein, “prison officials have a duty to protect prisoners from\n\nviolence at the hands of other prisoners.” Id. (quotation and alteration omitted).\n\nHowever, not “every injury suffered by one inmate at the hands of another . . .\n\ntranslates into constitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the\n\nvictim’s safety.” Id. at 834.\n\n      “A prison official violates the Eighth Amendment when a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm, of which the official is subjectively aware, exists and the official\n\ndoes not respond reasonably to the risk.” Caldwell, 748 F.3d at 1099 (emphasis\n\nomitted) (quoting Carter v. Galloway, 352 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). To prevail on such a claim brought under §\n\n1983, the plaintiff must show: (1) a substantial risk of serious harm; (2) the\n\n\n                                            9\n\f              Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 10 of 30\n\n\ndefendants’ deliberate indifference to that risk; and (3) a causal connection\n\nbetween the defendants’ conduct and the Eighth Amendment violation. See id.\n\nThe first element, a substantial risk of serious harm, is evaluated using an objective\n\nstandard. Id. There must be a “strong likelihood” of injury, “rather than a mere\n\npossibility,” before an official’s failure to act can constitute deliberate indifference.\n\nBrown v. Hughes, 894 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (quoting\n\nEdwards v. Gilbert, 867 F.2d 1271, 1276 (11th Cir. 1989)).\n\n      Brooks has failed to plausibly allege that a substantial risk of serious harm\n\nexisted prior to the prison riot. For Brooks to face serious harm, he and Watson\n\nboth needed to be released from their cells simultaneously in an unsupervised\n\nsituation. Although Brooks alleged that SMU doors had opened before, he did not\n\nallege that he and Watson had ever been let out of their cells at the same time, let\n\nalone in an unsupervised or chaotic environment where an attack could occur. Nor\n\ndid he ever allege that all 32 doors in the E-dorm had ever opened simultaneously,\n\ncreating the conditions for a prison riot. The most that can be taken from Brooks’s\n\ncomplaint, even in the most favorable light, is that it was possible for the events\n\nthat transpired to occur: that his and Watson’s cell doors would open\n\nsimultaneously during a situation that prevented immediate intervention by the\n\nguards, leading to serious injury. But mere possibility is not enough -- the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015       Page: 11 of 30\n\n\nmust plausibly allege a strong likelihood of serious harm, and Brooks has not here.\n\nTherefore, his claim must fail.2\n\n       Brooks makes two arguments about the substantial risk of serious harm.\n\nFirst, he claims that the very fact that he was attacked demonstrates that the risk he\n\nfaced -- and that the prison guards ignored -- was substantial. This argument does\n\nnot hold up to logical scrutiny; it rests entirely on hindsight bias. The mere fact\n\nthat an event takes place does not indicate how likely it was to occur. A risk\n\ncalculation is a prospective determination of what might happen based upon events\n\nthat have already occurred. Brooks’s injuries demonstrate that he suffered serious\n\nharm, but not all serious harm is precipitated by substantial risk; freak accidents do\n\noccur. The very fact of an injury may, in some circumstances, be a factor in\n\nassessing that ex ante risk, but it cannot be sufficient on its own to prove that a\n\nsubstantial risk existed. Indeed, we have warned that “[w]e will not allow the\n\nadvantage of hindsight to determine whether conditions of confinement amounted\n\nto ‘cruel and unusual’ punishment.” Purcell ex rel. Estate of Morgan v. Toombs\n\nCnty., 400 F.3d 1313, 1320 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n       Brooks relies on two cases to support this argument; neither is apposite.\n\nFirst, in Caldwell v. Warden, FCI Talladega, 748 F.3d 1090, a prisoner brought a\n\ndeliberate indifference claim against prison officials after he was attacked by his\n\n2\n Because Brooks has not adequately alleged a substantial risk of serious harm, we need not\nconsider whether his pleadings satisfy the remaining elements of a deliberate indifference claim.\n                                               11\n\f             Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 12 of 30\n\n\ncellmate. A panel of this Court noted in dicta that the defendants had not disputed\n\nthe existence of a substantial risk of serious harm, given the perpetrator’s history of\n\nprison violence, his record of starting fires in their shared cell, “and his violent\n\nassault on [the] plaintiff.” Id. at 1100. Thus, the Caldwell Court merely suggested\n\nin dicta that the attack against that plaintiff was one of many factors that went into\n\nthe calculus of determining a substantial risk of serious harm. Caldwell does not\n\nstand for the proposition -- nor could it -- that a single attack, alone, is somehow\n\nsufficient to show a substantial risk of serious harm. Brooks’s second case, an\n\nunpublished one, Johnson v. Boyd, 568 F. App’x 719 (11th Cir. 2014) (per\n\ncuriam), is equally unconvincing. In Johnson, the Court addressed a claim of\n\ndeliberate indifference regarding the prison officials’ inaction after the plaintiff had\n\nbeen attacked, not before. Id. at 722. In that context, the Court noted that “the\n\n[plaintiff’s] allegations describing [the] physical attack are sufficient to show an\n\nobjective risk of injury,” but the attack did not do double-duty as both an allegation\n\nof the harm suffered and an allegation of the risk that said harm would occur. Id.\n\n      Brooks also argues that the combination of two allegations creates a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm: first, Watson’s violent nature and specific threats\n\nleveled against Brooks; second, the fact that SMU cell doors had opened and\n\nallowed inmates out of their cells “numerous” times in the past. Brooks claims\n\nthat, taken together, this creates a plausible allegation of a substantial risk. But\n\n\n                                           12\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 13 of 30\n\n\neven construing Brooks’s pro se allegations liberally, he has not said enough to\n\nplausibly allege a substantial risk of serious harm. The extant risk, as alleged, was\n\nno more than possible, not substantial.\n\n      Brooks cites to Rodriguez v. Secretary for the Department of Corrections,\n\n508 F.3d 611 (11th Cir. 2007), in support of his claim. In Rodriguez, the plaintiff\n\nhad been segregated from the general prison population for security purposes,\n\nduring which time he received (and reported to prison authorities) specific death\n\nthreats from members of his former gang who were prisoners in the general\n\npopulation. Id. at 613-15. His requests for a transfer to another facility were\n\ndenied. Within hours of his release into the general prison population, a member\n\nof his former gang stabbed him in the chest and back. Id. at 615-16. The Court\n\nfound that “the gang-related threats made on Rodriguez’s life, which were\n\nexplicitly reported to prison officials, present[ed] a substantial enough risk of harm\n\nto trigger a prison official’s Eighth Amendment duty to act.” Id. at 617 n.12.\n\n      But, notably, in Rodriguez, the inmate’s planned release into the general\n\nprison population indisputably put him at risk for attack. In sharp contrast, in this\n\ncase, only the utterly unplanned and simultaneous opening of both Brooks’s and\n\nWatson’s doors would put Brooks in harm’s way. The risk Brooks faced, while\n\nnot nonexistent, was far more attenuated than the risk found in Rodriguez. It\n\nrequired a “perfect storm of events” in which all 32 doors in a maximum security\n\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 14 of 30\n\n\nwing opened at once. Appellee Brief at 23. Until that event, Brooks was not in\n\nimminent or foreseeable danger. He has not alleged that either he or Watson had\n\never gotten free of their cells before, let alone at the same time. No case from this\n\nCourt or the Supreme Court has found so remote a risk to be substantial enough to\n\ntrigger Eighth Amendment liability. The district court was correct to dismiss\n\nBrooks’s failure to protect claim.\n\n                                         IV.\n\n      We turn next to Brooks’s Eighth Amendment claim arising out of his alleged\n\nmistreatment in the hospital. The Eighth Amendment governs the conditions of a\n\nprisoner’s confinement. Helling, 509 U.S. at 31. Although “[t]he Constitution\n\ndoes not mandate comfortable prisons,” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832 (quotation\n\nomitted), it does not allow a prisoner to be exposed to an objectively “unreasonable\n\nrisk of serious damage to his future health.” Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278,\n\n1289 (11th Cir. 2004) (quoting Helling, 509 U.S. at 35). Moreover, the conditions\n\nof confinement must meet “the evolving standards of decency that mark the\n\nprogress of a maturing society.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 102-03 (1976)\n\n(quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).\n\n      As we said before, Brooks must have plausibly alleged a deliberate\n\nindifference claim: (1) a substantial risk of serious harm; (2) the defendants’\n\n\n                                          14\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 15 of 30\n\n\ndeliberate indifference to that risk; and (3) a causal connection between the\n\ndefendants’ conduct and the Eighth Amendment violation. The plaintiff must also\n\nnavigate around the doctrine of qualified immunity. Ultimately, we conclude that\n\nBrooks has adequately pled a § 1983 Eighth Amendment claim, and that Powell is\n\nnot protected by qualified immunity. However, because Brooks has not alleged a\n\nspecific physical injury resulting from this Eighth Amendment violation, his claims\n\nfor compensatory and punitive damages are barred by the Prison Litigation Reform\n\nAct (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). But we hold that his constitutional claim for\n\nnominal damages is not barred, and we remand to the district court for\n\nconsideration of that claim.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      To recap: Brooks alleges that Powell refused to allow Brooks to lower the\n\nwaist-chains that bound him so that he could use the toilet while in the hospital.\n\nAs a result, Brooks was forced to defecate into his jumpsuit and sit in his own\n\nfeces for two days during his three-day hospital stay. Brooks also alleges that\n\nPowell refused to allow the nurses to clean Brooks or offer him an adult diaper,\n\nand that Powell and the other guards laughed at Brooks and mocked him\n\nthroughout the ordeal. These serious allegations state an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation under our caselaw.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015       Page: 16 of 30\n\n\n       This Court, and the old Fifth Circuit, have long recognized a “well\n\nestablished” Eighth Amendment right “not to be confined . . . in conditions lacking\n\nbasic sanitation.” Chandler v. Baird, 926 F.2d 1057, 1066-67 (11th Cir. 1991). In\n\nChandler v. Baird, the plaintiff alleged that he had been deprived of toilet paper for\n\nthree days, running water for two days, and was not provided with soap, a\n\ntoothbrush, toothpaste, or bed linens. These conditions, combined with the\n\ninadequate heating of his cell, were sufficient to state an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation. Id. at 1063. We explained that “conditions that ‘deprive inmates of the\n\nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities’ are violative of the ‘contemporary\n\nstandard of decency’” that the Eighth Amendment demands. Id. at 1064 (quoting\n\nRhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347 (1981)). Many years earlier, in Novak v.\n\nBeto, 453 F.2d 661 (5th Cir. 1971),3 the former Fifth Circuit surveyed Eighth\n\nAmendment prison conditions cases and concluded: “[T]here is a common thread\n\nthat runs through all these cases . . . . That thread is the deprivation of basic\n\nelements of hygiene.” Id. at 665. In reaching this conclusion, the Court cited with\n\napproval cases in which prisoners had successfully stated Eighth Amendment\n\nclaims based on being placed in contact and close proximity with excrement -- just\n\nas Brooks alleges he was. See id.\n\n\n3\n In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court\nadopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to\nOctober 1, 1981.\n                                               16\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 17 of 30\n\n\n      Indeed, every sister circuit (except the Federal Circuit) has recognized that\n\nthe deprivation of basic sanitary conditions can constitute an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation. See Budd v. Motley, 711 F.3d 840, 843 (7th Cir. 2013) (per curiam)\n\n(“[A]llegations of unhygienic conditions, when combined with the jail’s failure to\n\nprovide detainees with a way to clean for themselves with running water or other\n\nsupplies, state a claim for relief.”); DeSpain v. Uphoff, 264 F.3d 965, 974 (10th\n\nCir. 2001) (“Exposure to human waste, like few other conditions of confinement,\n\nevokes both the health concerns emphasized in Farmer and the more general\n\nstandards of dignity embodied in the Eighth Amendment.”); Young v. Quinlan,\n\n960 F.2d 351, 365 (3d Cir. 1992) (“It would be an abomination of the Constitution\n\nto force a prisoner to live in his own excrement for four days . . . .”), superseded by\n\nstatute on other grounds as recognized by Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 71 n.7\n\n(2000); Howard v. Adkison, 887 F.2d 134, 137 (8th Cir. 1989) (noting that\n\n“inmates are entitled to reasonably adequate sanitation” and finding Eighth\n\nAmendment violation where cell was “covered with . . . human waste”); Inmates of\n\nOccoquan v. Barry, 844 F.2d 828, 836 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (recognizing “sanitation”\n\nas a “basic need” for prisoners protected by the Eighth Amendment); Parrish v.\n\nJohnson, 800 F.2d 600, 609 (6th Cir. 1986) (“[T]he Eighth Amendment protects\n\nprisoners from being . . . denied the basic elements of hygiene.”) (quotation\n\nomitted); Green v. McKaskle, 788 F.2d 1116, 1126 (5th Cir. 1986) (“[A] state\n\n\n                                          17\n\f              Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015     Page: 18 of 30\n\n\nmust furnish its prisoners with reasonable adequate . . . sanitation . . . to satisfy [the\n\nEighth Amendment’s] requirements.”) (quotation and alteration omitted);\n\nHoptowit v. Spellman, 753 F.2d 779, 784 (9th Cir. 1985) (noting that the failure to\n\nprovide “minimally sanitary” conditions “amounts to a violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment”); Hawkins v. Hall, 644 F.2d 914, 918 (1st Cir. 1981) (explaining that\n\nprison conditions “must be sanitary”) (quotation omitted); Hite v. Leeke, 564 F.2d\n\n670, 672 (4th Cir. 1977) (recognizing that “the denial of decent and basically\n\nsanity living conditions and the deprivation of basic elements of hygiene” can\n\nviolate the Eighth Amendment) (quotation omitted); LaReau v. MacDougall, 473\n\nF.2d 974, 978 (2d Cir. 1972) (“Causing a man to live, eat and perhaps sleep in\n\nclose confines with his own human waste is too debasing and degrading to be\n\npermitted.”). Moreover, the Supreme Court recognized in Hope v. Pelzer, 536\n\nU.S. 730 (2002), that “a deprivation of bathroom breaks . . . created a risk of\n\nparticular discomfort and humiliation” for the plaintiff, a prisoner who had been\n\nattached to a hitching post for seven hours. Id. at 738.\n\n      In some ways, Brooks’s allegations are worse than those found in the\n\ngoverning caselaw. Brooks claims that he was “forced to lie in direct and extended\n\ncontact with his own feces without any ability to clean himself, while confined to a\n\nhospital bed in maximum security constrains.” The Baird plaintiff, on the other\n\nhand, could move around his cell and was provided a functional toilet that he was\n\n\n                                           18\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 19 of 30\n\n\nallowed to use. And Brooks alleges that he was denied the ability to use the\n\nbathroom or clean himself for a full two days, while the plaintiff in Hope was\n\ndeprived of toilet access for seven hours. Id. at 735.\n\n      Powell argues, nevertheless, that the Eighth Amendment protects only\n\nagainst “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” and that Brooks has not\n\nalleged any such pain from his hospital experience, so he has failed to state a\n\nclaim. This argument mirrors the district court’s conclusion that the plaintiff’s\n\nhospital treatment allegations amount to nothing more than “mere discomfort,”\n\nwhich is not cognizable under the Eighth Amendment. On the contrary, the Baird\n\nCourt held that the plaintiff’s claim defeated summary judgment without any\n\nrequirement that he allege pain. 926 F.2d at 1066. Brooks has sufficiently alleged\n\na substantial risk of serious harm, as the health risks of prolonged exposure to\n\nhuman excrement are obvious. See DeSpain, 264 F.3d at 974 (finding substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm where prisoner was exposed to standing water in his cell that\n\ncontained his own urine and other prisoners’ waste for 36 hours). Thus, we have\n\nlittle trouble concluding that Powell’s alleged actions satisfy the objective element\n\nof an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n      Brooks has also sufficiently alleged that Powell was deliberately indifferent\n\nto the substantial risk of serious harm Brooks endured during his hospital stay.\n\nBrooks satisfies the subjective component of deliberate indifference: he\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 20 of 30\n\n\nspecifically alleged that he repeatedly begged Powell to let him remove his\n\njumpsuit and use the toilet, so Powell was plainly aware of the risk Brooks faced.\n\nBrooks also satisfies the objective component of deliberate indifference because he\n\nalleges that Powell did not “respond reasonably” to Brooks’s request -- far from it.\n\nInstead, Brooks claims that Powell subjected him to derision and ridicule while he\n\nwas forced to repeatedly soil himself.\n\n      Powell attempts to excuse his alleged behavior by citing the “legitimate\n\nsecurity concerns” present in the hospital. To the extent Powell claims that reasons\n\nof public safety demanded that Brooks be required to sit in a soiled jumpsuit for\n\ntwo days, he can offer such evidence at a later stage in the proceedings. But taking\n\nall of Brooks’s allegations as true, as we must at this stage, his description of\n\nPowell’s behavior states a plausible claim of deliberate indifference. Brooks was\n\n64 years old and 155 pounds at the time, and was monitored by four armed officers\n\nat all times -- it is far from obvious how allowing Brooks to use the toilet would\n\nhave posed a serious safety concern. Moreover, Powell’s alleged laughter and\n\ntaunts are wholly inconsistent with reasonable behavior taken for legitimate public\n\nsafety reasons.\n\n      Finally, there is no dispute as to the causation element of Brooks’s hygiene\n\nclaim. According to Brooks, Powell supervised him in the hospital, refused his\n\nrequests to use the toilet, refused to allow the nurses to clean him, and refused him\n\n\n                                          20\n\f             Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 21 of 30\n\n\nthe use of an adult diaper. These actions directly resulted in an alleged Eighth\n\nAmendment violation.\n\n                                           B.\n\n      The district court dismissed Brooks’s hygiene claim on the ground that\n\nPowell was protected by qualified immunity. We disagree.\n\n      “[Q]ualified immunity protects government officials ‘from liability for civil\n\ndamages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.’” Pearson\n\nv. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 (2009) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S.\n\n800, 818 (1982)). “In order to receive qualified immunity, the public official ‘must\n\nfirst prove that he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority when\n\nthe allegedly wrongful acts occurred.’” Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1194 (11th\n\nCir. 2002) (quoting Courson v. McMillian, 939 F.2d 1479, 1487 (11th Cir. 1991)).\n\nNo one disputes that Powell was acting within the scope of his discretionary\n\nauthority when he supervised Brooks in the hospital.\n\n      After the defendant has established that he was acting in a discretionary\n\ncapacity, “the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that qualified immunity is not\n\nappropriate.” Id. This requires establishing that the official’s alleged conduct\n\nviolated a constitutional right, and that the constitutional right at issue was clearly\n\n\n\n\n                                           21\n\f             Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 22 of 30\n\n\nestablished. See id. Courts may take up these two steps in either order. See\n\nPearson, 555 U.S. at 236.\n\n      Having determined that Powell’s alleged conduct violated the Eighth\n\nAmendment, we turn to whether the Eighth Amendment right at issue “was clearly\n\nestablished such that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing\n\nviolates that right.” Coffin v. Brandau, 642 F.3d 999, 1013 (11th Cir. 2011) (en\n\nbanc) (quoting Bashir v. Rockdale Cnty., 445 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir. 2006)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). A right can be clearly established “either by\n\nsimilar prior precedent, or in rare cases of ‘obvious clarity.’” Gilmore v. Hodges,\n\n738 F.3d 266, 277 (11th Cir. 2013). “Exact factual identity with a previously\n\ndecided case is not required, but the unlawfulness of the conduct must be apparent\n\nfrom pre-existing law.” Coffin, 642 F.3d at 1013.\n\n      The district court found “no clearly established law” warned Powell that his\n\nalleged actions constituted an Eighth Amendment violation. But both Baird and\n\nNovak (neither mentioned by the district court) should have been sufficient to put\n\nPowell on notice. Baird recognized that Eighth Amendment violations can arise\n\nfrom “conditions lacking basic sanitation,” including inadequate provision of\n\nhygiene items such as toilet paper. 926 F.2d at 1066. Novak noted that\n\n“deprivation of basic elements of hygiene” was a “common thread” running\n\nthrough prison conditions cases, including several involving proximity to human\n\n\n                                         22\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015        Page: 23 of 30\n\n\nwaste. 453 F.2d at 665. It’s true that neither case involved the precise\n\ncircumstances at issue here. But “[e]xact factual identity with a previously decided\n\ncase is not required.” Coffin, 642 F.3d at 1013; see Hope, 536 U.S. at 741\n\n(“[O]fficials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even\n\nin novel factual circumstances.”). Baird and Novak, together, would have\n\nprovided “fair and clear warning” that Brooks’s alleged treatment would violate\n\nthe Eighth Amendment. Hope, 536 U.S. at 741 (quoting United States v. Lanier,\n\n520 U.S. 259, 271 (1997)).4\n\n       What’s more, a reasonable official should not have needed Baird or Novak\n\nto know that Powell’s alleged actions violated Brooks’s Eighth Amendment rights.\n\nThis is the “rare case[] of ‘obvious clarity,’” Gilmore, 738 F.3d at 277, in which\n\n“conduct is so egregious that no prior case law is needed to put a reasonable officer\n\non notice of its unconstitutionality,” id. at 279. Forcing a prisoner to soil himself\n\nover a two-day period while chained in a hospital bed creates an obvious health\n\nrisk and is an affront to human dignity. Laughing at and ridiculing an inmate who\n\nis forced to sit in his own feces for an extended period of time is not merely\n\n\n4\n  The appellees distinguish these cases on the ground that they concerned conditions within a\nprison cell, while Brooks’s treatment took place in a hospital room. True enough. But they do\nnot persuasively explain why this distinction is relevant to our constitutional analysis, or why\nthat difference alone prevented Powell from being on notice. After all, Hope itself involved\nconduct that took place outside of a prison cell, yet the Supreme Court held that earlier cases\ninvolving similar conduct inside a prison cell should have provided officials with sufficient\nnotice. 536 U.S. at 742-43. And in each instance, the inmate was restrained by authority of a\nlegal determination and placed in the custody of prison officials.\n                                                23\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 24 of 30\n\n\nunreasonable, but an act of “obvious cruelty.” See Hope, 536 U.S. at 745 (“The\n\nobvious cruelty inherent in this practice should have provided respondents with\n\nsome notice that their alleged conduct violated Hope’s constitutional protection\n\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment.”) Any reasonable officer should have\n\nknown that such conduct was at war with the command of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlthough qualified immunity is a “muscular doctrine,” it cannot save Powell here.\n\nFoy v. Holston, 94 F.3d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir. 1996).\n\n                                          V.\n\n      Brooks’s claim, however, is further governed by the Prison Litigation\n\nReform Act of 1995, Pub.L. No. 104-134, §§ 802-10, 110 Stat. 1321, 1366-77\n\n(1996). The PLRA places substantial restrictions on the judicial relief that\n\nprisoners can seek, with the goal of “reduc[ing] the number of frivolous cases filed\n\nby imprisoned plaintiffs, who have little to lose and excessive amounts of free time\n\nwith which to pursue their complaints.” Al-Amin v. Smith, 637 F.3d 1192, 1195\n\n(11th Cir. 2011) (quoting Napier v. Preslicka, 314 F.3d 528, 531 (11th Cir. 2002)).\n\nThe section of the Act at issue here, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), reads this way:\n\n      No Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a\n      jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional\n      injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical\n      injury or the commission of a sexual act . . . .\n\nThis Court has held that § 1997e(e) applies to all federal civil actions, including\n\nconstitutional claims brought under § 1983. See Harris v. Garner (Harris II), 216\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 25 of 30\n\n\nF.3d 970, 984-85 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). The district court did not consider the\n\napplicability of § 1997e(e) to Brooks’s claims, since it dismissed them on other\n\ngrounds.\n\n      In this case, Brooks did not allege any physical injury arising from his\n\nhospital stay. Nevertheless, he sought “compensatory . . . punitive, and nominal\n\ndamages” from Powell. Under the statute and our caselaw, an incarcerated\n\nplaintiff cannot recover either compensatory or punitive damages for constitutional\n\nviolations unless he can demonstrate a (more than de minimis) physical injury.\n\nSee Al-Amin, 637 F.3d at 1198 (punitive); Harris v. Garner (Harris I), 190 F.3d\n\n1279, 1286 (11th Cir. 1999) (compensatory), reh’g en banc granted and opinion\n\nvacated, 197 F.3d 1059 (11th Cir. 1999), opinion reinstated in relevant part, 216\n\nF.3d 970. However, we have never had the opportunity in a published opinion to\n\nsettle the availability of nominal damages under the PLRA. We do today, and we\n\nhold that nothing in § 1997e(e) prevents a prisoner from recovering nominal\n\ndamages for a constitutional violation without a showing of physical injury.\n\n      It has long been recognized in the caselaw of the Supreme Court and our\n\nCircuit that nominal damages serve to “vindicate[] deprivations of certain\n\n‘absolute’ rights that are not shown to have caused actual injury.” Carey v. Piphus,\n\n435 U.S. 247, 266 (1978); see also Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477\n\nU.S. 299, 308 n.11 (1986) (“[N]ominal damages . . . are the appropriate means of\n\n\n                                         25\n\f             Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 26 of 30\n\n\n‘vindicating’ rights whose deprivation has not caused actual, provable injury . . .\n\n.”); Hughes v. Lott, 350 F.3d 1157, 1162 (11th Cir. 2003) (“Nominal damages are\n\nappropriate if a plaintiff establishes a violation of a fundamental constitutional\n\nright, even if he cannot prove actual injury sufficient to entitle him to\n\ncompensatory damages.”). The Supreme Court has observed that the availability\n\nof nominal damages serves a symbolic function: it “recognizes the importance to\n\norganized society that those rights be scrupulously observed,” even if no injury\n\noccurs that would justify compensatory damages. Carey, 435 U.S. at 266; see\n\nCalhoun v. DeTella, 319 F.3d 936, 941 (7th Cir. 2003) (“[N]ominal damages are\n\nnot compensation for loss or injury, but rather recognition of a violation of rights.”\n\n(quotation omitted)); Douglas Laycock, Modern American Remedies 615-16 (4th\n\ned. 2010) (noting that nominal damages “serve a declaratory function”).\n\n      As we see it, both the text and purpose of the PLRA support the conclusion\n\nthat § 1997e(e) does not bar a prisoner from recovering nominal damages without a\n\nshowing of physical injury. First, the plain text of § 1997e(e) does not encompass\n\nnominal damages claims for constitutional violations. Brooks’s nominal damages\n\nclaim is not brought “for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody\n\nwithout a prior showing of physical injury” -- rather, it is designed to vindicate the\n\ndeprivation of his constitutional rights. Indeed, the very theory of such a nominal\n\ndamages claim “dispenses with any need for injury other than the deprivation of\n\n\n                                          26\n\f             Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 27 of 30\n\n\nthe right itself.” Davis v. Dist. of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342, 1349 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1998). This interpretation of § 1997e(e) is consistent with the PLRA’s purpose of\n\nminimizing frivolous prison litigation. We have held that § 1997e(e) applies to\n\npunitive damages, partly because any other interpretation would “thwart[]”\n\nCongress’s “evident intent,” and allow prisoners to avoid the PLRA’s physical\n\ninjury requirement “simply by adding a claim for punitive damages.” Al-Amin,\n\n637 F.3d at 1197 (quoting Davis, 158 F.3d at 1348)). But the prospect of punitive\n\ndamages provides a major financial incentive for prisoners to bring frivolous\n\nlitigation. See Dawes v. Walker, 239 F.3d 489, 497 (2d Cir. 2001) (Walker, C.J.,\n\nwriting separately) (“The potential for a windfall punitive award -- no matter how\n\nremote -- provides a powerful economic incentive for prisoners to continue to file\n\nfrivolous § 1983 claims based on concocted or imagined emotional injuries.”),\n\noverruled on other grounds as recognized by Phelps v. Kapnolas, 308 F.3d 180,\n\n187 n.6 (2d Cir. 2002). The availability of merely nominal damages provides no\n\nsuch lure. “[P]risoners are presumably a good deal less likely to embark on a\n\nlawsuit if there is no prospect of a pecuniary reward.” Davis, 158 F.3d at 1349.\n\nAllowing claims for nominal damages without a physical injury does not pose the\n\nsame threat to Congress’s intent.\n\n      Our conclusion that nominal damages may be sought by an inmate for\n\nconstitutional injury is in accord with the determination made by every other sister\n\n\n                                         27\n\f              Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015     Page: 28 of 30\n\n\ncircuit to consider this issue. See Kuperman v. Wrenn, 645 F.3d 69, 73 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2011); Hutchins v. McDaniels, 512 F.3d 193, 198 (5th Cir. 2007) (per curiam);\n\nRoyal v. Kautzky, 375 F.3d 720, 723 (8th Cir. 2004); Calhoun, 319 F.3d at 941;\n\nOliver v. Keller, 289 F.3d 623, 630 (9th Cir. 2002); Thompson v. Carter, 284 F.3d\n\n411, 418 (2d Cir. 2002); Searles v. Van Bebber, 251 F.3d 869, 878-79 (10th Cir.\n\n2001); Allah v. Al-Hafeez, 226 F.3d 247, 252 (3d Cir. 2000). The D.C. Circuit,\n\nthe only other circuit court to share our view that § 1997e(e) applies to punitive\n\ndamages, has never directly addressed the availability of nominal damages. But it,\n\ntoo, has noted in dicta that this issue is “clearly harder . . . than for punitive\n\ndamages,” both because the theory behind nominal damages “dispenses with any\n\nneed for injury other than the deprivation of the right itself” and because such\n\ndamages create precious little financial incentive for prisoner plaintiffs. Davis, 158\n\nF.3d at 1349.\n\n       We make clear and hold today what we have long implied in our own\n\ncaselaw. In past § 1997e(e) prison litigation cases, we have expressly held open\n\nthe possibility that nominal damages may be available. See Harris I, 190 F.3d at\n\n1288 n.9; Al-Amin, 637 F.3d at 1199 n.10. In some cases, we have suggested in\n\ndicta that nominal damages are available. Thus, for example, in Hughes v. Lott we\n\nobserved that “[n]ominal damages are appropriate if a plaintiff establishes a\n\nviolation of a fundamental constitutional right, even if he cannot prove actual\n\n\n                                            28\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015       Page: 29 of 30\n\n\ninjury sufficient to entitle him to compensatory damages,” and cited with approval\n\nthe cases of five other circuits that had interpreted § 1997e(e) as we do today. 350\n\nF.3d at 1162 (citing the Second, Third, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits). (In\n\nHughes, we remanded to the district court for consideration of whether nominal\n\ndamages were available under § 1997e(e) without a showing of physical injury,\n\nand whether the plaintiff had sought nominal damages in the first place. Id. at\n\n1162-63.) And in Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255 (11th Cir. 2007), abrogated by\n\nSossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651 (2011), 5 we noted in dicta that “nominal\n\ndamages may sometimes be appropriate under § 1997e(e),” and that “in earlier\n\ncases, we have suggested that § 1997(e) does not preclude a prisoner from seeking\n\nnominal damages if he can establish that he has suffered a constitutional injury.”\n\nId. at 1271 (citing Hughes, 350 F.3d at 1162). Indeed, in Smith we determined that\n\nthe prisoner plaintiff “may seek nominal damages” despite his lack of alleged\n\nphysical harm, id., and proceeded to consider the merits of his claim -- although we\n\nultimately determined that it was meritless, id. at 1276. Finally, today’s holding\n\nconfirms what we have explicitly held in a number of non-binding unpublished\n\nopinions. See, e.g., Logan v. Hall, 604 F. App’x 838, 840 (11th Cir. 2015) (per\n\ncuriam); Jackson v. Hill, 569 F. App’x 697, 699 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam);\n5\n  In Smith, this Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not shield the state and its agents\nfrom official capacity actions for damages under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act (RLUIPA). 502 F.3d at 1276 n.12. In Sossamon, the Supreme Court disagreed,\nholding that RLUIPA did not clearly waive Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity for\nmonetary damages, thereby abrogating that portion of Smith. 131 S. Ct. at 1659-63.\n                                               29\n\f            Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 30 of 30\n\n\nWilliams v. Brown, 347 F. App’x 429, 436-37 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam);\n\nFrazier v. McDonough, 264 F. App’x 812, 815 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).\n\n      Thus, we conclude that Brooks may proceed with his § 1983 Eighth\n\nAmendment claim stemming from his alleged mistreatment in Spalding County\n\nHospital, but only for nominal damages.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in\n\npart, and REMANDED for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f",

Ginsburg, United States Circuit Judge for the District of Columbia,\nsitting by designation.\n\f              Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 2 of 30\n\n\n      Fred Dalton Brooks is currently incarcerated in the Special Management\n\nUnit (“SMU”) at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison (“GDCP”) in\n\nJackson, Georgia. He has brought two Eighth Amendment claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983: one against Warden Carl Humphrey, Deputy Warden William Powell,\n\nDeputy Warden June Bishop, and SMU Unit Manager James McMillan stemming\n\nfrom injuries he sustained during a prison riot; and another against only Deputy\n\nWarden Powell based on the conditions of his confinement at Spalding County\n\nHospital following the riot.\n\n      Brooks alleges that within days of being placed in the SMU, he received\n\nthreats of physical and sexual assault from the inmate in the adjacent cell. He\n\nreported these threats but no action was taken. The cell doors in the SMU were\n\nknown to open unintentionally. One day, all 32 doors in his SMU dormitory\n\nopened simultaneously, a riot ensued, and he was brutally attacked by the inmate\n\nwho had threatened him. He was taken to the hospital for three days, where he was\n\nplaced in maximum-security restraints. He was given medicine that gave him\n\nloose stools, but the guard refused to lower his waist-chains so he could defecate.\n\nHe was forced to defecate in his jumpsuit for two days and sit in his own\n\nexcrement, during which time the guard laughed and taunted him. Brooks brought\n\ndeliberate indifference claims relating to both incidents in the United States\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f               Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 3 of 30\n\n\nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Georgia. The district court dismissed\n\nboth.\n\n        After thorough review, we affirm the dismissal of Brooks’s failure to protect\n\nclaim arising out of the prison riot, but reverse as to his claim that his Eighth\n\nAmendment rights were violated by his alleged mistreatment at the hospital.\n\nBrooks did not adequately allege a substantial risk of serious harm in the period\n\nleading up the prison riot. However, he did adequately plead an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation arising out of his three-day hospital stay. Moreover, as to\n\nthe claim that Brooks had been confined in conditions lacking in basic sanitation,\n\nDeputy Warden Powell is not entitled to qualified immunity. He was put on fair\n\nnotice both by our caselaw and the knowledge that forcing a prisoner to soil\n\nhimself over a two-day period while chained in a hospital bed creates an obvious\n\nhealth risk and is an affront to human dignity.\n\n        Because Brooks has not alleged any physical injury resulting from his\n\nhospital stay, under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e), he\n\ncannot recover compensatory or punitive damages. We do hold today, however,\n\nthat Brooks can proceed with his claim for nominal damages for a violation of his\n\nEighth Amendment rights, and we remand to the district court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                            I.\n\n\n                                            3\n\f              Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 4 of 30\n\n\n      Brooks’s amended complaint alleged the following essential facts. Brooks\n\nwas placed in the Special Management Unit on February 7, 2012, under the direct\n\norders of Humphrey, Powell, and Bishop. The SMU has six dormitories, each of\n\nwhich contains 32 individual cells. Brooks’s cell was located in the E-dorm,\n\nadjacent to a cell occupied by inmate Tremayne Watson. Within days of Brooks’s\n\narrival, Watson allegedly threatened to physically attack and sexually assault him.\n\n(Brooks was, at the time, 64 years old; five feet, nine inches tall; and 155 pounds.)\n\nDespite being in a separate cell from Watson, Brooks feared for his safety. He\n\ngave “detailed notes” of Watson’s threats to Humphrey, Powell, Bishop, and\n\nMcMillan. Brooks was not moved from his cell.\n\n      On February 29, 2012, all 32 doors in the E-dorm opened simultaneously\n\nwhile a maintenance man and officer were in the control booth, and a violent riot\n\nbroke out. Watson attacked Brooks: he put him in a chokehold, punched him in\n\nthe face, and beat him over the head with a ten-pound food tray, leaving Brooks\n\nwith serious wounds, broken teeth, and a concussion. Watson then dragged Brooks\n\non his hands and knees into Brooks’s cell and forced Brooks to perform oral sex.\n\nAfter the riot was quelled, Brooks was initially taken to the prison infirmary for\n\ntreatment, but his injuries were serious enough to require that he be transferred to\n\nSpalding County Hospital.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015        Page: 5 of 30\n\n\n       Brooks remained in the hospital for three days. Throughout his stay, Brooks\n\nwas shackled with leg irons and maximum-security waist-chain handcuffs. He was\n\nguarded at all times by Deputy Warden Powell and three other correctional\n\nofficers. He received medicine that “caused [his] bowels to have the liquidity of\n\nwater.” During his second day at the hospital, Brooks began asking and then\n\npleading with Powell to allow him to use the toilet. Powell refused to temporarily\n\nlower Brooks’s waist-chains so he could defecate. Instead, Brooks was forced to\n\nsoil his jumpsuit for the remainder of his stay in the hospital. Powell and the\n\ncorrectional officers “laughed and made fun of” Brooks during this ordeal. 1\n\n       The prison officials moved to dismiss the complaint and Brooks responded.\n\nIn his Response, Brooks alleged for the first time that “the opening of cell doors,\n\neven multiple cell doors[,] in the SMU occurs regularly and is known by all the\n\nDefendants.” He added that “multiple prisoners can sometimes get out of their\n\ncells simultaneously.” Brooks also claimed that “most of the inmates housed in\n\n[the] SMU have been put there because they have committed acts of violence . . .\n\nin the prison system,” and that it was a “well known fact” that “Watson [was] the\n\nmost violent and troublesome inmate in [the] SMU.”\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Although it does not form a part of his § 1983 claim, Brooks also alleged that Powell and the\nother officers refused to uncuff one of Brooks’s hands so he could eat. Instead, they told him, “If\nyou want to eat it bad enough, lick it off the tray like a dog.” Brooks was then forced to lick the\nfood off his tray while Powell and other officers laughed and ridiculed him.\n                                                5\n\f              Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 6 of 30\n\n\n      On July 18, 2013, the magistrate judge entered a Report recommending that\n\nthe Motions to Dismiss be granted in their entirety. As for the failure to protect\n\nclaim, the magistrate judge concluded that Brooks’s allegations did not suggest\n\nthat the defendants had subjective knowledge of a strong likelihood that Brooks\n\nwould be subject to an attack in prison. The court noted that the complaint had not\n\nalleged that Brooks and Watson had ever been outside their cells simultaneously,\n\nor that Watson “otherwise had the opportunity to carry out the threats.” The\n\nmagistrate judge also reasoned that the failure to move Brooks to another cell\n\n(farther from Watson) “amount[ed] only to negligence,” not deliberate\n\nindifference. As for Brooks’s hospital treatment claim, the magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that Powell was protected by qualified immunity because “the facts\n\nalleged [did] not involve a risk to Plaintiff’s health or safety,” and, therefore, it was\n\nnot clearly established that Powell’s conduct violated the Eighth Amendment.\n\n      On August 8, 2013, Brooks moved for reconsideration of the magistrate\n\njudge’s Report and Recommendation. The district court treated the motion as an\n\nobjection to the magistrate’s Report, and construed the new factual allegations as a\n\nsecond Motion to Amend. Brooks conceded that he “did not allege that\n\nDefendants could have foreseen . . . that the maintenance man would open all the\n\ncell doors” in the SMU. However, he maintained that the defendants “knew that\n\nmultiple cell door openings ‘could’ occur” because “similar cell door openings\n\n\n                                            6\n\f              Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 7 of 30\n\n\nhave occurred on prior occasions in [the] SMU.” He claimed that “[t]here have\n\nbeen numerous instances of inmates being able to get out of their cells without\n\nauthorization.” As for his treatment at the hospital, Brooks reiterated that he was\n\n“forced to lie in his own excrement during his entire hospitalization,” thereby\n\ndirectly exposing him to a significant health risk. Notably, Brooks did not allege\n\nthat he sustained any physical injury as a result. Finally, he also claimed that\n\nPowell “refused to allow the nursing staff to clean” Brooks’s body and refused to\n\nallow him to use an adult diaper.\n\n      The district court denied Brooks’s re-styled Motion to Amend as “futile”\n\nbecause “[e]ven with these new allegations [he] fail[ed] to allege colorable Eighth\n\nAmendment claims for the same reasons stated in the [magistrate judge’s]\n\nRecommendation.”\n\n      Brooks timely appealed and was appointed counsel by this Court.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      We review de novo the dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim\n\nunder Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; we accept all factual\n\nallegations as true and consider them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n\nStarship Enters. of Atlanta, Inc. v.

For Brooks to face serious harm, he and Watson\n\nboth needed to be released from their cells simultaneously in an unsupervised\n\nsituation. Although Brooks alleged that SMU doors had opened before, he did not\n\nallege that he and Watson had ever been let out of their cells at the same time, let\n\nalone in an unsupervised or chaotic environment where an attack could occur. Nor\n\ndid he ever allege that all 32 doors in the E-dorm had ever opened simultaneously,\n\ncreating the conditions for a prison riot. The most that can be taken from Brooks’s\n\ncomplaint, even in the most favorable light, is that it was possible for the events\n\nthat transpired to occur: that his and Watson’s cell doors would open\n\nsimultaneously during a situation that prevented immediate intervention by the\n\nguards, leading to serious injury. But mere possibility is not enough -- the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015       Page: 11 of 30\n\n\nmust plausibly allege a strong likelihood of serious harm, and Brooks has not here.\n\nTherefore, his claim must fail.2\n\n       Brooks makes two arguments about the substantial risk of serious harm.\n\nFirst, he claims that the very fact that he was attacked demonstrates that the risk he\n\nfaced -- and that the prison guards ignored -- was substantial. This argument does\n\nnot hold up to logical scrutiny; it rests entirely on hindsight bias. The mere fact\n\nthat an event takes place does not indicate how likely it was to occur. A risk\n\ncalculation is a prospective determination of what might happen based upon events\n\nthat have already occurred. Brooks’s injuries demonstrate that he suffered serious\n\nharm, but not all serious harm is precipitated by substantial risk; freak accidents do\n\noccur. The very fact of an injury may, in some circumstances, be a factor in\n\nassessing that ex ante risk, but it cannot be sufficient on its own to prove that a\n\nsubstantial risk existed. Indeed, we have warned that “[w]e will not allow the\n\nadvantage of hindsight to determine whether conditions of confinement amounted\n\nto ‘cruel and unusual’ punishment.” Purcell ex rel.

Warden, FCI Talladega, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a prisoner brought a\n\ndeliberate indifference claim against prison officials after he was attacked by his\n\n2\n Because Brooks has not adequately alleged a substantial risk of serious harm, we need not\nconsider whether his pleadings satisfy the remaining elements of a deliberate indifference claim.\n                                               11\n\f             Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 12 of 30\n\n\ncellmate. A panel of this Court noted in dicta that the defendants had not disputed\n\nthe existence of a substantial risk of serious harm, given the perpetrator’s history of\n\nprison violence, his record of starting fires in their shared cell, “and his violent\n\nassault on [the] plaintiff.” Id. at 1100. Thus, the Caldwell Court merely suggested\n\nin dicta that the attack against that plaintiff was one of many factors that went into\n\nthe calculus of determining a substantial risk of serious harm. Caldwell does not\n\nstand for the proposition -- nor could it -- that a single attack, alone, is somehow\n\nsufficient to show a substantial risk of serious harm. Brooks’s second case, an\n\nunpublished one, Johnson v. Boyd, 568 F. App’x 719 (11th Cir. 2014) (per\n\ncuriam), is equally unconvincing. In Johnson, the Court addressed a claim of\n\ndeliberate indifference regarding the prison officials’ inaction after the plaintiff had\n\nbeen attacked, not before. Id. at 722. In that context, the Court noted that “the\n\n[plaintiff’s] allegations describing [the] physical attack are sufficient to show an\n\nobjective risk of injury,” but the attack did not do double-duty as both an allegation\n\nof the harm suffered and an allegation of the risk that said harm would occur. Id.\n\n      Brooks also argues that the combination of two allegations creates a\n\nsubstantial risk of serious harm: first, Watson’s violent nature and specific threats\n\nleveled against Brooks; second, the fact that SMU cell doors had opened and\n\nallowed inmates out of their cells “numerous” times in the past. Brooks claims\n\nthat, taken together, this creates a plausible allegation of a substantial risk. But\n\n\n                                           12\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 13 of 30\n\n\neven construing Brooks’s pro se allegations liberally, he has not said enough to\n\nplausibly allege a substantial risk of serious harm. The extant risk, as alleged, was\n\nno more than possible, not substantial.\n\n      Brooks cites to Rodriguez v. Secretary for the Department of Corrections,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77855\"><a href=\"/opinion/77855/rodriguez-v-secretary-for-dept-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2007), in support of his claim. In Rodriguez, the plaintiff\n\nhad been segregated from the general prison population for security purposes,\n\nduring which time he received (and reported to prison authorities) specific death\n\nthreats from members of his former gang who were prisoners in the general\n\npopulation. Id. at 613-15. His requests for a transfer to another facility were\n\ndenied. Within hours of his release into the general prison population, a member\n\nof his former gang stabbed him in the chest and back. Id. at 615-16. The Court\n\nfound that “the gang-related threats made on Rodriguez’s life, which were\n\nexplicitly reported to prison officials, present[ed] a substantial enough risk of harm\n\nto trigger a prison official’s Eighth Amendment duty to act.” Id. at 617 n.12.\n\n      But, notably, in Rodriguez, the inmate’s planned release into the general\n\nprison population indisputably put him at risk for attack. In sharp contrast, in this\n\ncase, only the utterly unplanned and simultaneous opening of both Brooks’s and\n\nWatson’s doors would put Brooks in harm’s way. The risk Brooks faced, while\n\nnot nonexistent, was far more attenuated than the risk found in Rodriguez. It\n\nrequired a “perfect storm of events” in which all 32 doors in a maximum security\n\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 14 of 30\n\n\nwing opened at once. Appellee Brief at 23. Until that event, Brooks was not in\n\nimminent or foreseeable danger. He has not alleged that either he or Watson had\n\never gotten free of their cells before, let alone at the same time. No case from this\n\nCourt or the Supreme Court has found so remote a risk to be substantial enough to\n\ntrigger Eighth Amendment liability. The district court was correct to dismiss\n\nBrooks’s failure to protect claim.\n\n                                         IV.\n\n      We turn next to Brooks’s Eighth Amendment claim arising out of his alleged\n\nmistreatment in the hospital. The Eighth Amendment governs the conditions of a\n\nprisoner’s confinement. Helling, 509 U.S. at 31. Although “[t]he Constitution\n\ndoes not mandate comfortable prisons,” Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832 (quotation\n\nomitted), it does not allow a prisoner to be exposed to an objectively “unreasonable\n\nrisk of serious damage to his future health.” Chandler v.

The plaintiff must also\n\nnavigate around the doctrine of qualified immunity. Ultimately, we conclude that\n\nBrooks has adequately pled a § 1983 Eighth Amendment claim, and that Powell is\n\nnot protected by qualified immunity. However, because Brooks has not alleged a\n\nspecific physical injury resulting from this Eighth Amendment violation, his claims\n\nfor compensatory and punitive damages are barred by the Prison Litigation Reform\n\nAct (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e). But we hold that his constitutional claim for\n\nnominal damages is not barred, and we remand to the district court for\n\nconsideration of that claim.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      To recap: Brooks alleges that Powell refused to allow Brooks to lower the\n\nwaist-chains that bound him so that he could use the toilet while in the hospital.\n\nAs a result, Brooks was forced to defecate into his jumpsuit and sit in his own\n\nfeces for two days during his three-day hospital stay. Brooks also alleges that\n\nPowell refused to allow the nurses to clean Brooks or offer him an adult diaper,\n\nand that Powell and the other guards laughed at Brooks and mocked him\n\nthroughout the ordeal. These serious allegations state an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation under our caselaw.\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015       Page: 16 of 30\n\n\n       This Court, and the old Fifth Circuit, have long recognized a “well\n\nestablished” Eighth Amendment right “not to be confined . . . in conditions lacking\n\nbasic sanitation.” Chandler v.

In\n\nChandler v.

These conditions, combined with the\n\ninadequate heating of his cell, were sufficient to state an Eighth Amendment\n\nviolation. Id. at 1063. We explained that “conditions that ‘deprive inmates of the\n\nminimal civilized measure of life’s necessities’ are violative of the ‘contemporary\n\nstandard of decency’” that the Eighth Amendment demands.

Id. at 738.\n\n      In some ways, Brooks’s allegations are worse than those found in the\n\ngoverning caselaw. Brooks claims that he was “forced to lie in direct and extended\n\ncontact with his own feces without any ability to clean himself, while confined to a\n\nhospital bed in maximum security constrains.” The Baird plaintiff, on the other\n\nhand, could move around his cell and was provided a functional toilet that he was\n\n\n                                           18\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 19 of 30\n\n\nallowed to use. And Brooks alleges that he was denied the ability to use the\n\nbathroom or clean himself for a full two days, while the plaintiff in Hope was\n\ndeprived of toilet access for seven hours. Id. at 735.\n\n      Powell argues, nevertheless, that the Eighth Amendment protects only\n\nagainst “unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,” and that Brooks has not\n\nalleged any such pain from his hospital experience, so he has failed to state a\n\nclaim. This argument mirrors the district court’s conclusion that the plaintiff’s\n\nhospital treatment allegations amount to nothing more than “mere discomfort,”\n\nwhich is not cognizable under the Eighth Amendment. On the contrary, the Baird\n\nCourt held that the plaintiff’s claim defeated summary judgment without any\n\nrequirement that he allege pain. 926 F.2d at 1066. Brooks has sufficiently alleged\n\na substantial risk of serious harm, as the health risks of prolonged exposure to\n\nhuman excrement are obvious. See DeSpain, 264 F.3d at 974 (finding substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm where prisoner was exposed to standing water in his cell that\n\ncontained his own urine and other prisoners’ waste for 36 hours). Thus, we have\n\nlittle trouble concluding that Powell’s alleged actions satisfy the objective element\n\nof an Eighth Amendment violation.\n\n      Brooks has also sufficiently alleged that Powell was deliberately indifferent\n\nto the substantial risk of serious harm Brooks endured during his hospital stay.\n\nBrooks satisfies the subjective component of deliberate indifference: he\n\n\n                                          19\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 20 of 30\n\n\nspecifically alleged that he repeatedly begged Powell to let him remove his\n\njumpsuit and use the toilet, so Powell was plainly aware of the risk Brooks faced.\n\nBrooks also satisfies the objective component of deliberate indifference because he\n\nalleges that Powell did not “respond reasonably” to Brooks’s request -- far from it.\n\nInstead, Brooks claims that Powell subjected him to derision and ridicule while he\n\nwas forced to repeatedly soil himself.\n\n      Powell attempts to excuse his alleged behavior by citing the “legitimate\n\nsecurity concerns” present in the hospital. To the extent Powell claims that reasons\n\nof public safety demanded that Brooks be required to sit in a soiled jumpsuit for\n\ntwo days, he can offer such evidence at a later stage in the proceedings. But taking\n\nall of Brooks’s allegations as true, as we must at this stage, his description of\n\nPowell’s behavior states a plausible claim of deliberate indifference. Brooks was\n\n64 years old and 155 pounds at the time, and was monitored by four armed officers\n\nat all times -- it is far from obvious how allowing Brooks to use the toilet would\n\nhave posed a serious safety concern. Moreover, Powell’s alleged laughter and\n\ntaunts are wholly inconsistent with reasonable behavior taken for legitimate public\n\nsafety reasons.\n\n      Finally, there is no dispute as to the causation element of Brooks’s hygiene\n\nclaim. According to Brooks, Powell supervised him in the hospital, refused his\n\nrequests to use the toilet, refused to allow the nurses to clean him, and refused him\n\n\n                                          20\n\f             Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 21 of 30\n\n\nthe use of an adult diaper.

True enough. But they do\nnot persuasively explain why this distinction is relevant to our constitutional analysis, or why\nthat difference alone prevented Powell from being on notice. After all, Hope itself involved\nconduct that took place outside of a prison cell, yet the Supreme Court held that earlier cases\ninvolving similar conduct inside a prison cell should have provided officials with sufficient\nnotice. 536 U.S. at 742-43. And in each instance, the inmate was restrained by authority of a\nlegal determination and placed in the custody of prison officials.\n                                                23\n\f             Case: 13-14437     Date Filed: 09/03/2015    Page: 24 of 30\n\n\nunreasonable, but an act of “obvious cruelty.” See Hope, 536 U.S. at 745 (“The\n\nobvious cruelty inherent in this practice should have provided respondents with\n\nsome notice that their alleged conduct violated Hope’s constitutional protection\n\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment.”) Any reasonable officer should have\n\nknown that such conduct was at war with the command of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nAlthough qualified immunity is a “muscular doctrine,” it cannot save Powell here.\n\nFoy v.

We have held that § 1997e(e) applies to\n\npunitive damages, partly because any other interpretation would “thwart[]”\n\nCongress’s “evident intent,” and allow prisoners to avoid the PLRA’s physical\n\ninjury requirement “simply by adding a claim for punitive damages.” Al-Amin,\n\n637 F.3d at 1197 (quoting Davis, 158 F.3d at 1348)).

Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771990\"><a href=\"/opinion/771990/ian-dawes-v-hans-walker-superintendent-auburn-correctional-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 497 (2d Cir. 2001) (Walker, C.J.,\n\nwriting separately) (“The potential for a windfall punitive award -- no matter how\n\nremote -- provides a powerful economic incentive for prisoners to continue to file\n\nfrivolous § 1983 claims based on concocted or imagined emotional injuries.”),\n\noverruled on other grounds as recognized by Phelps v.

The availability of merely nominal damages provides no\n\nsuch lure. “[P]risoners are presumably a good deal less likely to embark on a\n\nlawsuit if there is no prospect of a pecuniary reward.” Davis, 158 F.3d at 1349.\n\nAllowing claims for nominal damages without a physical injury does not pose the\n\nsame threat to Congress’s intent.\n\n      Our conclusion that nominal damages may be sought by an inmate for\n\nconstitutional injury is in accord with the determination made by every other sister\n\n\n                                         27\n\f              Case: 13-14437      Date Filed: 09/03/2015     Page: 28 of 30\n\n\ncircuit to consider this issue.

The D.C. Circuit,\n\nthe only other circuit court to share our view that § 1997e(e) applies to punitive\n\ndamages, has never directly addressed the availability of nominal damages. But it,\n\ntoo, has noted in dicta that this issue is “clearly harder . . . than for punitive\n\ndamages,” both because the theory behind nominal damages “dispenses with any\n\nneed for injury other than the deprivation of the right itself” and because such\n\ndamages create precious little financial incentive for prisoner plaintiffs. Davis, 158\n\nF.3d at 1349.\n\n       We make clear and hold today what we have long implied in our own\n\ncaselaw. In past § 1997e(e) prison litigation cases, we have expressly held open\n\nthe possibility that nominal damages may be available. See Harris I, 190 F.3d at\n\n1288 n.9; Al-Amin, 637 F.3d at 1199 n.10. In some cases, we have suggested in\n\ndicta that nominal damages are available. Thus, for example, in Hughes v. Lott we\n\nobserved that “[n]ominal damages are appropriate if a plaintiff establishes a\n\nviolation of a fundamental constitutional right, even if he cannot prove actual\n\n\n                                            28\n\f               Case: 13-14437       Date Filed: 09/03/2015       Page: 29 of 30\n\n\ninjury sufficient to entitle him to compensatory damages,” and cited with approval\n\nthe cases of five other circuits that had interpreted § 1997e(e) as we do today. 350\n\nF.3d at 1162 (citing the Second, Third, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits). (In\n\nHughes, we remanded to the district court for consideration of whether nominal\n\ndamages were available under § 1997e(e) without a showing of physical injury,\n\nand whether the plaintiff had sought nominal damages in the first place. Id. at\n\n1162-63.) And in Smith v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77840\"><a href=\"/opinion/77840/smith-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 2007), abrogated by\n\nSossamon v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"215077\"><a href=\"/opinion/215077/sossamon-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1651</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011), 5 we noted in dicta that “nominal\n\ndamages may sometimes be appropriate under § 1997e(e),” and that “in earlier\n\ncases, we have suggested that § 1997(e) does not preclude a prisoner from seeking\n\nnominal damages if he can establish that he has suffered a constitutional injury.”\n\nId. at 1271 (citing Hughes, 350 F.3d at 1162). Indeed, in Smith we determined that\n\nthe prisoner plaintiff “may seek nominal damages” despite his lack of alleged\n\nphysical harm, id., and proceeded to consider the merits of his claim -- although we\n\nultimately determined that it was meritless, id. at 1276. Finally, today’s holding\n\nconfirms what we have explicitly held in a number of non-binding unpublished\n\nopinions. See, e.g., Logan v. Hall, 604 F. App’x 838, 840 (11th Cir. 2015) (per\n\ncuriam); Jackson v. Hill, 569 F. App’x 697, 699 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam);\n5\n  In Smith, this Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not shield the state and its agents\nfrom official capacity actions for damages under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act (RLUIPA). 502 F.3d at 1276 n.12. In Sossamon, the Supreme Court disagreed,\nholding that RLUIPA did not clearly waive Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity for\nmonetary damages, thereby abrogating that portion of Smith. 131 S. Ct. at 1659-63.\n                                               29\n\f            Case: 13-14437    Date Filed: 09/03/2015   Page: 30 of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Will.</span> <span class=\"page\">v</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Brown, 347 F. App’x 429, 436-37 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam);\n\nFrazier v. McDonough, 264 F. App’x 812, 815 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).\n\n      Thus, we conclude that Brooks may proceed with his § 1983 Eighth\n\nAmendment claim stemming from his alleged mistreatment in Spalding County\n\nHospital, but only for nominal damages.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in\n\npart, and REMANDED for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f</pre>",
