Grote, III; William\nDominic Grote, IV; Walter F. Grote, Jr.; Michael R. Grote;\nW. Frederick Grote, III; and John R. Grote. For ease of reference,\nwe refer to them collectively as the Grote Family. Grote Indus-\ntries consists of two companies formed under the laws of\nIndiana: Grote Industries, LLC, and Grote Industries, Inc. The\nGrote Family, including members not listed as plaintiffs,\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                   3\n\ninjunction pending appeal. See F ED. R. A PP. P. 8. We\nrecently granted such an injunction in a similar case.\nSee Korte v. Sebelius, No. 12-3841, 2012 WL 6757353\n(7th Cir. Dec. 28, 2012). As explained below, this case is\nmaterially indistinguishable. Accordingly, we consolidate\nthis case with Korte and likewise grant the motion here.\n   The Grote Family owns Grote Industries, a privately\nheld, family-run business headquartered in Madison,\nIndiana. Grote Industries manufactures vehicle safety\nsystems. The company has 1,148 full-time employees\nworking at various locations and provides a group health-\ninsurance plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan\nis self-insured and renews every year on January 1.\n  The members of the Grote Family are Catholic and\noperate their business in accordance with the precepts\nof their faith, including the Catholic Church’s teachings\nregarding the moral wrongfulness of abortifacient drugs,\ncontraception, and sterilization. Consistent with the\nGrote Family’s religious commitments, before January 1,\n2013, the Grote Industries health-insurance plan did not\ncover abortifacient drugs, contraception, or sterilization.\n  The ACA and accompanying regulations mandate that\nthe Grote Industries health-insurance plan provide no-\ncost coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptives,\nsterilization procedures, and related services. In brief,\nthe regulatory framework imposing this mandate is as\n\n\n1\n  (...continued)\nfully own Grote Industries, Inc. This entity, in turn, serves as\nthe managing member of Grote Industries, LLC.\n\f4                                               No. 13-1077\n\nfollows: The ACA requires nongrandfathered and nonex-\nempt group health-insurance plans to cover certain pre-\nventive health services without cost-sharing, see 42 U.S.C.\n§ 300gg-13(a)(4), and regulations promulgated by the\nUnited States Department of Health and Human\nServices (“HHS”) specify that the required coverage\nmust include all FDA-approved contraceptive methods\nand sterilization procedures, see 77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15,\n2012) (“the contraception mandate” or “the man-\ndate”). This includes oral contraceptives with possible\nabortifacient effect (including emergency contraception\nsuch as the “morning-after pill”) and intrauterine devices.\nSee id.; O FFICE OF W OMEN’S H EALTH, F OOD & D RUG\nA DMIN., B IRTH C ONTROL G UIDE 10-12, 16-20 (2012),\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsum ers/\nByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/UCM282014.pdf.\n   The contraception mandate takes effect starting in the\nfirst plan year after August 1, 2012. See 77 Fed. Reg. at\n8725-26. Because the Grote Industries health-insurance\nplan renews on January 1 of each year, the mandate\nrequired the company to begin covering oral contracep-\ntion, sterilization procedures, intrauterine devices, and\nemergency contraception when the plan renewed on\nJanuary 1, 2013. The mandate is backed by heavy\nfinancial penalties; employers who do not comply face\nenforcement actions, see 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a); a penalty of\n$100 per day per employee, see 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(a)-(b);\nand an annual tax surcharge of $2,000 per employee, see\nid. § 4980H.\n The Grote Family and Grote Industries filed suit on\nOctober 29, 2012, seeking declaratory and injunctive\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                 5\n\nrelief blocking the enforcement of the contraception\nmandate against them. They assert constitutional claims\nunder the Free Exercise, Establishment, and Free Speech\nClauses of the First Amendment, and the Due Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, as well as claims\nalleging violations of the Religious Freedom Restora-\ntion Act (“RFRA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb to 2000bb-4, and\nthe Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706. They\nmoved for a preliminary injunction; the district court\ndenied the motion on December 27, 2012. Grote Indus., LLC\nv. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6725905, at *1 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 27, 2012).\n  The following day we issued our order in Korte\ngranting the motion for an injunction pending appeal,\n2012 WL 6757353, at *1, prompting the Grote Family and\nGrote Industries to request reconsideration in the dis-\ntrict court. On January 3, 2013, the district court, aware\nof our decision in Korte, denied the motion for recon-\nsideration. The court acknowledged the similarities\nbetween Korte and this case but declined to follow\nour order in Korte, emphasizing that it was not a\nprecedential ruling on the merits. Grote Indus., LLC v.\nSebelius, 2013 WL 53736, at *1 (S.D. Ind. Jan. 3, 2013).\nThis appeal followed. See 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). As\nin Korte, the Grote Family and Grote Industries\nmoved for an injunction pending appeal,2 relying for\n\n\n\n2\n  We evaluate a motion for an injunction pending appeal\nusing the same factors and “sliding scale” approach that\ngovern an application for a preliminary injunction. See Cavel\n                                               (continued...)\n\f6                                                    No. 13-1077\n\npresent purposes solely on their RFRA claim.3\n  There is no material distinction between the motion in\nthis case and the one we addressed and granted in\nKorte. There, we considered the likelihood of success of\na claim brought by a secular, for-profit corporation\nowned and operated by a Catholic family in accordance\nwith the teachings of the Catholic faith. Korte, 2012 WL\n6757353, at *1. The Kortes, like the Grote Family here, sued\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief in the form of an\nexemption from the requirements of the contraception\n\n\n\n2\n  (...continued)\nInt’l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 544, 547-48 (7th Cir. 2007). The\nmoving party must establish that it has “(1) no adequate\nremedy at law and will suffer irreparable harm if a preliminary\ninjunction is denied and (2) some likelihood of success on\nthe merits.” Ezell v. City of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 694 (7th Cir.\n2011). Once the threshold requirements are met, the court\nweighs the equities, balancing each party’s likelihood of\nsuccess against the potential harms. Girl Scouts of Manitou\nCouncil, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of the U.S., Inc., 549 F.3d 1079, 1100\n(7th Cir. 2008). The more the balance of harms tips in favor of\nan injunction, the lighter the burden on the party seeking\nthe injunction to demonstrate that it will ultimately prevail.\nAbbott Labs. v. Mead Johnson & Co., 971 F.2d 6, 12 (7th Cir. 1992).\n3\n  RFRA prohibits the federal government from imposing\na “substantial[] burden [on] a person’s exercise of religion\neven if the burden results from a rule of general applicability”\nunless the government demonstrates that the burden “(1) is\nin furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and\n(2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling\ngovernmental interest.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000bb-1(a)-(b).\n\fNo. 13-1077                                              7\n\nmandate. The Kortes’ company, K & L Contractors,\nprovided a group health-insurance plan for its nonunion\nemployees. In August 2012 the Kortes discovered that\nthe plan included coverage for contraception and\nwanted to replace it with a plan that conforms to the\nrequirements of their faith, but the contraception man-\ndate prevented them from doing so. Id. They sued the\nHHS Secretary asserting (among other claims for relief)\nthat the mandate violated their rights under RFRA. They\nmoved for a preliminary injunction, but the district court\ndenied the motion. The Kortes and their company (col-\nlectively, “the Kortes”) appealed. They asked us for an\ninjunction pending appeal, and we granted the motion.\nReserving plenary review for later in the appeal, we\nheld that the Kortes had established a reasonable likeli-\nhood of success on their RFRA claim. Id. at *3-4. We\nalso held that the equitable balance tipped in favor of\ngranting the injunction; the harm to the Kortes’ religious-\nliberty rights outweighed the temporary harm to the\ngovernment’s interest in providing greater access to cost-\nfree contraception and related services. Id. at *4-5.\n   In all important respects, this case is identical to\nKorte; our analysis there applies with equal force here. If\nanything, the Grote Family and Grote Industries have a\nmore compelling case for an injunction pending appeal.\nUnlike the health-insurance plan at issue in Korte, the\nGrote Industries health plan is self-insured and has\nnever provided contraception coverage. Absent an in-\njunction, the Grote Family and Grote Industries must\nnow cover abortifacient drugs, contraception, and ster-\nilization through the company’s self-insured health\nplan. Thus, the only factual distinctions between the two\n\f8                                               No. 13-1077\n\ncases actually strengthen the equities in favor of granting\nan injunction pending appeal.\n  And the legal analysis has not changed. The Grote\nFamily and Grote Industries make essentially the same\narguments as did the Kortes. They maintain that the\nlegal duties imposed on them by the contraception man-\ndate conflict with the religious duties required by their\nfaith, and they cannot comply with both. The mandate,\nthey contend, compels them to materially cooperate in a\ngrave moral wrong contrary to the teachings of their\nchurch and levies severe financial penalties if they do\nnot comply. In this way, they argue, the mandate sub-\nstantially burdens their free-exercise rights, triggering\nthe strict-scrutiny test codified in RFRA. As we noted in\nKorte, this “is an exacting standard, and the government\nbears the burden of satisfying it.” Id. at *2.\n  In response the government advances the same argu-\nments as it did in Korte. To abbreviate, the govern-\nment maintains that (1) a secular, for-profit corporation\ncannot assert a claim under RFRA; (2) relatedly, the free-\nexercise rights of the individual plaintiffs are not affected\nbecause their corporation is a separate legal entity; and\n(3) the mandate’s burden on their free-exercise rights is\ntoo remote and attenuated to qualify as “substantial”\nunder RFRA because the decision to use contracep-\ntion benefits is made by third parties—individual em-\nployees, in consultation with their medical providers.\nWe addressed these arguments in our order in Korte, and\nnothing presented here requires us to reconsider that\nprior ruling. Here, as in Korte, the Grote Family’s use\nof the corporate form is not dispositive of the claim.\n\fNo. 13-1077                                              9\n\nSee Korte, 2012 WL 6757353, at *3 (citing Citizens United\nv. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558 U.S. 310 (2010)). And the\ngovernment’s minimalist characterization of the burden\ncontinues to obscure the substance of the religious-liberty\nviolation asserted here. Id. The members of the Grote\nFamily contend that their faith forbids them to facilitate\naccess to contraception by paying for it, as the\nmandate requires them to do.\n  And as in Korte, the government has not, at this\njuncture, made an effort to satisfy strict scrutiny. In\nparticular, it has not demonstrated that requiring\nreligious objectors to provide cost-free contraception\ncoverage is the least restrictive means of increasing\naccess to contraception. Although we again reserve\nplenary review of the merits for later in this appeal, for\nthe reasons explained more thoroughly in our order in\nKorte, id. at *2-5, we conclude that the Grote Family and\nGrote Industries have established a reasonable likelihood\nof success on the merits of their RFRA claim. We also\nconclude that they will suffer irreparable harm absent\nan injunction pending appeal, and the balance of harms\ntips in their favor.\n  I T IS O RDERED that the motion for an injunction\npending appeal is G RANTED . The defendants are\nenjoined pending resolution of this appeal from\nenforcing the contraception mandate against the Grote\nFamily and Grote Industries.\n  IT IS F URTHER O RDERED that this case is consolidated\nwith Korte. Oral argument will be scheduled by separate\norder when briefing has been completed.\n\f10                                              No. 13-1077\n\n   R OVNER, Circuit Judge, dissenting. As a result of the\ncourt’s decision to consolidate this appeal with Korte\nv. Sebelius, No. 12-3841, the Grote appellants’ request for\nan injunction pending appeal comes before the same\npanel that ordered preliminary relief in Korte. See Korte v.\nSebelius, 2012 WL 6757353 (7th Cir. Dec. 28, 2012) (unpub-\nlished order). I recognize that the arguments in favor\nof preliminary relief in Grote are in some ways stronger\nthan those in Korte (for example, the Grotes’ company\nwas not already covering contraceptive care when the\nnew federal mandate took effect, whereas the Kortes’\ncompany was). Despite the differences between the\ntwo appeals, I am no more persuaded that preliminary\ninjunctive relief is warranted in Grote than I was in Korte.\nSpecifically, the appellants have not, in my view, shown\nthat they are reasonably likely to prevail on the merits of\ntheir claims. See Cavel Int’l, Inc. v. Madigan, 500 F.3d 544,\n547-48 (7th Cir. 2007). With the benefit of the memoranda\nsubmitted by the parties in Grote and additional time\nto contemplate some of the issues presented by these\nappeals, I write separately here to expand on the doubts\nI expressed in Korte.\n  Of the multiple theories of relief that the Grote\nplaintiffs have so far articulated in this litigation (and\nwhich were given thorough treatment in the district\ncourt’s orders below), the only one invoked in this court\nas a basis for preliminary relief pending appeal is their\nclaim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of\n1993, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000bb et seq. (“RFRA”). Among other\nelements, that claim requires a showing that the\nregulatory mandate to provide contraceptive coverage,\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                11\n\nissued pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable\nCare Act, see 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-13(a)(4) (“Affordable\nCare Act”); 77 Fed. Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15, 2012), sub-\nstantially burdens the plaintiffs’ exercise of religion.\n§ 2000bb-1(a), (b). A substantial burden is “one that\nnecessarily bears a direct, primary, and fundamental\nresponsibility for rendering religious exercise . . . effec-\ntively impracticable.” Civil Liberties for Urban Believers v.\nCity of Chicago, 342 F.3d 752, 761 (7th Cir. 2003) (construing\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act,\n42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc et seq. (“RLUIPA”)); see Vision Church\nv. Village of Long Grove, 468 F.3d 975, 997 (7th Cir. 2006)\n(RLUIPA) (“Similarly, interpreting the First Amend-\nment, the Supreme Court has found a ‘substantial bur-\nden’ to exist when the government puts ‘substantial\npressure on an adherent to modify his behavior and to\nviolate his beliefs.’ ”) (quoting Hobbie v. Unemployment\nAppeals Comm’n of Florida, 480 U.S. 136, 141, 107 S. Ct. 1046,\n1049 (1987)); see also Nelson v. Miller, 570 F.3d 868, 878\n(7th Cir. 2009) (RLUIPA and First Amendment); Koger\nv. Bryan, 523 F.3d 789, 799 (7th Cir. 2008) (RLUIPA).\nLike Judge Barker, I am not persuaded that the plain-\ntiffs have made that showing.\n  I begin my analysis with a threshold point: on the\nrecord before us, it is only the Grotes, and not the corpo-\nrate entities, which can claim to have a right to exercise\nreligious freedoms. Grote Industries (by which I mean to\ninclude both Grote Industries, LLC and Grote Industries,\nInc.) is a secular, for-profit business engaged in the manu-\nfacture of vehicle safety systems. So far as the limited\nrecord before us reveals, it has stated no religious goals\n\f12                                                No. 13-1077\n\nas part of its mission, it does not select its employees,\nvendors, or customers on the basis of their religious\nbeliefs, and it does not require its employees to conform\ntheir behavior to any particular religious precepts. As\nsuch, I cannot imagine that the company, as distinct\nfrom the Grotes, has any religious interests or rights to\nassert here. To be sure, a secular corporation does\nhave some types of First Amendment rights: it has the\nright to engage in commercial speech in the promotion\nof its products, for example, see generally Cent. Hudson\nGas & Elec. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557,\n100 S. Ct. 2343 (1980), and in pursuit of its interests as\na corporate citizen, it has the right to articulate what gov-\nernment policies it supports or opposes and to spend\nmoney in the political arena in pursuit of its com-\nmercial agenda, see Citizens United v. Fed. Election\nComm’n, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010). Moreover,\nthere do exist some corporate entities which are\norganized expressly to pursue religious ends, and I think\nit fair to assume that such entities may have cognizable\nreligious liberties independent of the people who\nanimate them, even if they are profit-seeking. See, e.g.,\nTyndale House Publishers, Inc. v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 5817323,\nat *6-*7 (D.D.C. Nov. 16, 2012) (for-profit publisher\nof Christian texts, owned by not-for-profit religious\nfoundation and related trusts which directed publisher’s\nprofits to religious charity and educational work); see\nalso Corp. of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of\nLatter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 345 n.6, 107 S. Ct.\n2862, 2873 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring in the judg-\nment) (“it is . . . conceivable that some for-profit activities\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                      13\n\ncould have a religious character”).1 Indeed, there is a\nregulatory exemption from the contraception mandate\nfor religious employers. 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(1)(iv)(B).\nBut it appears to be common ground among the parties\nthat Grote Industries does not meet the criteria for such\nan employer. So far as it appears, the mission of Grote\nIndustries, like that of any other for-profit, secular busi-\nness, is to make money in the commercial sphere. In\nshort, the only religious freedoms at issue in this appeal\nare those of the Grotes, not the companies they own. See\nHobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 870 F. Supp. 2d 1278,\n\n\n\n1\n   Compare E.E.O.C. v. Townley Eng’g & Mfg.

Grote\nIndustries is a closely-held, family-owned firm, and\nI suspect there is a natural inclination for the owners of\nsuch companies to elide the distinction between them-\nselves and the companies they own. 2 But there is a dis-\ntinction, and it matters in important respects.

Although the corporations’\nincome flows to the Grotes, the corporate form signif-\nicantly limits the Grotes’ liability; the corporations, unlike\nthe Grotes, have potentially unlimited life spans; and\nownership of the corporations may be transferred from\nthe Grotes to others. More to the point, it is Grote Indus-\ntries that employs over 1,100 people around the world,\nnot the Grotes themselves; it is Grote Industries which,\nas the employer, sponsors a health care plan for the com-\npany’s employees; and it is that health plan which is\nnow obligated by the Affordable Care Act and resulting\nregulations to provide contraceptive coverage to the\n464 employees who work in the United States. Indeed,\nas the government points out, the health plan itself is a\ndistinct legal entity. See 29 U.S.C. § 1132(d)(1) (“An em-\nployee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this\nsubchapter as an entity.”).3 It is worth adding that the\n\n\n3\n  But see also Leister v.

See 45 C.F.R. Parts 160\nand 164; U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Health\nInformation Privacy, www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/\nunderstanding/index.html (last visited Jan. 27, 2013).\n  I recognize that the Grote Industries health plan is self-\nfunded, so the additional level of separation provided\nby an insurance company, which was present in Korte, is\nmissing here. See Tyndale House Publishers, 2012 WL\n5817323, at *13 (finding this to be a “crucial distinction”).\nMy fundamental point remains the same, however: the\nobligation to cover contraceptives falls not on the Grotes\npersonally but on Grote Industries’ health care plan.\nFurthermore, the money used to fund that plan belongs\nto the company, not to the Grotes. The owners of an LLC\nor corporation, even a closely-held one, have an obliga-\ntion to respect the corporate form, on pain of losing the\nbenefits of that form should they fail to do so. See, e.g.,\nWachovia Sec., LLC v. Banco Panamericano, Inc., 674 F.3d\n743 (7th Cir. 2012); Laborers’ Pension Fund v. Lay-Com, Inc.,\n\n\n\n3\n  (...continued)\nwhich the plan has never been unambiguously identified as\na distinct entity, we have permitted the plaintiff to name as\ndefendant whatever entity or entities, individual or corporate,\ncontrol the plan”).\n\fNo. 13-1077                                               17\n\n580 F.3d 602 (7th Cir. 2009). The Grotes are not at liberty\nto treat the company’s bank accounts as their own; co-\nmingling personal and corporate funds is a classic sign\nthat a company owner is disregarding the corporate\nform and treating the business as his alter ego. See, e.g.,\nVan Dorn Co. v. Future Chem. & Oil. Corp., 753 F.2d 565,\n570 (7th Cir. 1985) (Illinois law); Aronson v. Price, 644\nN.E.2d 864, 867 (Ind. 1994). So long as the business’s\nliabilities are not the Grotes’ liabilities—which is the\nprimary and “invaluable privilege” conferred by the\ncorporate form, Torco Oil Co. v. Innovative Thermal Corp.,\n763 F. Supp. 1445, 1451 (N.D. Ill. 1991) (Posner, J., sitting\nby designation)—neither are the business’s expenditures\nthe Grotes’ own expenditures. To suggest, for purposes\nof the RFRA, that monies used to fund the Grote\nIndustries health plan—including, in particular, any\nmonies spent paying for employee contraceptive care—\nought to be treated as monies from the Grotes’ own\npockets would be to make an argument for piercing\nthe corporate veil. I do not understand the Grotes to be\nmaking such an argument.\n  The Grotes consequently are, in both law and fact,\nseparated by multiple steps from both the coverage\nthat the company health plan provides and from the\ndecisions that individual employees make in consulta-\ntion with their physicians as to what covered services\nthey will use. Any burden imposed on the Grotes indi-\nvidually by the contraception mandate is, as Judge\nBarker reasoned, “likely too remote and attenuated to be\nconsidered substantial” for purposes of the RFRA. Grote\nIndus., LLC v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6725905, at *5 (S.D. Ind.\n\f18                                              No. 13-1077\n\nDec. 27, 2012) (citing O’Brien v.

Sebelius, 2013 WL 140110,\nat *14 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 11, 2013) (“whatever burden the\nHahns may feel from being involved with a for-profit\ncorporation that provides health insurance that could\npossibly be used for contraceptives, that burden is\nsimply too indirect to be considered substantial under\nthe RFRA”).\n  I understand the Grotes’ concern—the closely-held\ncorporation of which they are controlling shareholders\nis funding a plan that must now cover contraceptive\nservices, which are inconsistent with their Catholic\nbeliefs. Although Grote Industries is not a religious\nemployer, the Grotes aver, albeit without elaboration,\nthat they seek to run the company in a manner that\nreflects their religious beliefs. Whatever else that may\nmean, I assume that it explains why, to date, Grote In-\ndustries’ self-funded health plan has not included\ncoverage for contraceptives. Requiring the company to\ninclude coverage for contraceptives forces the Grotes to\noperate the business in a way that deviates from the\nCatholic values that they otherwise endeavor as busi-\nness owners to observe.\n  But in this respect the Grotes are no different from\nany number of business people who must, in compliance\nwith a variety of statutory mandates, take actions that\nmay be inconsistent with their individual religious con-\nvictions. The Grotes have voluntarily elected to engage\n\fNo. 13-1077                                            19\n\nin a large-scale, secular, for-profit enterprise. As the\nSupreme Court observed in United States v. Lee,\n“When followers of a particular sect enter into com-\nmercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they\naccept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience\nand faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory\nschemes which are binding on others in that activity.”\n455 U.S. 252, 261, 102 S. Ct. 1051, 1057 (1982) (declining\nto relieve Amish employer of obligation to pay Social\nSecurity taxes, despite acceptance of contention that\nboth receipt and payment of Social Security benefits\nviolates Amish faith); see also Braunfeld v.

In evaluating\nthe burden that such requirements impose on a business\nowner’s religious liberties, one must distinguish be-\ntween an owner’s commercial conduct and his religious\nbeliefs and conduct. Requiring a secular business over\nthe religious objection of its owner to do something in\nthe commercial sphere that is required of nearly all\nsuch businesses ordinarily does not require the owner\nto abandon his religious tenets, to endorse conduct or\nexpress an opinion that is contrary to his religious\nbeliefs, or to modify his private conduct as a religious\nobservant. See Swanner, 874 P.2d at 283 (“It is important\nto note that any burden placed on Swanner’s religion\n\n\n4\n   (...continued)\nreligious liberties of a business owner. E.g., McClure, 370 N.W.2d\nat 852 (relying on state agency’s concession that statute\nabridged the business owners’ religious beliefs). However, the\ncases also consistently emphasize the importance of an\nowner’s voluntary decision to engage in commercial activity,\nwhether as a reason why any burden imposed by such\nstatutes on the owner’s religious beliefs and practices should be\nviewed as minimal, or as a reason why that burden, even\nif substantial, is outweighed by the State’s compelling interest\nin eradicating discrimination.

Here, the burden on his conduct affects his\ncommercial activities.”); McClure, 370 N.W.2d at 853\n(finding that the burden on business owners’ religious\ninterests was justified by State’s interest in eradicating\ndiscrimination: “Sports and Health is not a religious\ncorporation—it is a Minnesota business corporation\nengaged in business for profit. By engaging in this\nsecular endeavor, appellants have passed over the line\nthat affords them absolute freedom to exercise their\nreligious beliefs.”).\n  The contraception mandate, as applied to Grote Indus-\ntries, does not compel the Grotes to personally engage\nin or endorse conduct of which they disapprove on reli-\ngious grounds: they need not use contraception,\nspeak approvingly of it, or refrain from discouraging\nthe use of contraception by others. See Conestoga Wood\nSpecialties, 2013 WL 140110, at *14; Grote Indus., 2012 WL\n6725905, at *5-*6; O’Brien, 2012 WL 4481208, at *6. All\nthat the mandate requires is that the Grote Industries\nhealth plan permit individual employees, in consultation\nwith their physicians, to decide to use FDA-approved\ncontraceptives and pay for the use of those contracep-\ntives. The Grotes know that their company’s health\nplan must cover contraception, and that one or more of\ntheir employees may decide to take advantage of that\ncoverage, and that the health plan is therefore sub-\nsidizing a practice, by others, of which they disapprove.\n  To the extent this burdens the Grotes’ religious\ninterests, it is worth considering whether the burden is\n\fNo. 13-1077                                               23\n\ndifferent in kind from the burden of knowing that an\nemployee might be using his or her Grote Industries\npaycheck (or money in a health care reimbursement\naccount) to pay for contraception him or herself. See\nConestoga Wood Specialties, 2013 WL 140110, at *13;\nAutocam Corp. v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6845677, at *6 (W.D.\nMich. Dec. 24, 2012). The likely response is that in the\nlatter scenario, once a paycheck is handed over to the\nemployee, the money is his or hers to use as desired,\nand any connection to the Grotes—and thus any burden\non their religious interests—is severed. But consider\nthat health insurance is an element of employee com-\npensation. See 30 C.J.S. Employer-Employee § 176 (West-\nlaw through 2012); Dana Shilling, L AWYERS D ESK\nB OOK, Medical Insurance § 3.07 (2012); see also, e.g., Tatom\nv. Ameritech Corp., 305 F.3d 737, 739 (7th Cir. 2002); Doe\nv. Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wis., 112 F.3d 869,\n874 (7th Cir. 1997). How an employee independently\nchooses to use that insurance arguably may be no\ndifferent in kind from the ways in which she decides to\nspend her take-home pay. See Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677,\nat *6. The likeness is easy to see when the employer\npurchases health coverage from an insurer: once the\ncoverage is purchased and the employee is named as a\nbeneficiary, the employer has conveyed the benefit to\nthe employee, and it is up to the employee and her physi-\ncian (not to mention the insurer) how she will use\nthat coverage.\n  The situation may seem different when the employer\nchooses instead to self-fund the health care plan, in that\nthe employer rather than an insurer is paying the bills\n\f24                                              No. 13-1077\n\nand there is thus a more direct monetary link between\nthe employer and whatever medical care that the em-\nployee is choosing for herself. But is the difference mate-\nrial? Either way, the employee is making wholly indep-\nendent decisions about how to use an element of her\ncompensation. Conestoga Wood Specialties, 2013 WL 140110,\nat *13-*14; Autocam, 2012 WL 6845677, at *6. And either\nway, although the employer knows that certain services\nto which it has religious objections are covered by the\nplan, it plays no role in an employee’s decision whether\nor not to use those services, it is not the provider of\nthose services (as it might be if it were providing health\ncare through a company-owned clinic), and it is not\nendorsing those services. See Cedric Kuschner Promotions,\nsupra, 533 U.S. at 163, 121 S. Ct. at 2091 (“linguistically\nspeaking, the employee and the corporation are different\npersons, even where the employee is the corporation’s\nsole owner”).\n  The Supreme Court’s decision in Zelman v. Simmons-\nHarris, 536 U.S. 639, 652, 122 S. Ct. 2460, 2467 (2002), is,\nas one academic has pointed out, a helpful reference\npoint in evaluating the nexus between an employer’s\nfunding of a health plan and the health care decisions\nan employee makes pursuant to that plan. See Caroline\nMala Corbin, The Contraception Mandate, 107 N W . U NIV . L.\nR EV. C OLLOQUY 151, 158-59 (Nov. 27, 2012). Zelman dealt\nwith an Establishment Clause challenge to a pilot school\n“scholarship” or voucher program in Ohio. Of the more\nthan 3,700 students who participated in the program\nduring one school year, 96 percent of them used the\nvouchers to enroll at religious-affiliated schools. 536 U.S.\n\fNo. 13-1077                                             25\n\nat 647, 122 S. Ct. at 2464. Among other arguments,\nOhio taxpayers contended that the program violated\nthe Establishment Clause for two reasons: (1) notwith-\nstanding the private choices made by voucher\nrecipients, the flow of voucher funds to religious\nschools was properly attributable to the State, such that\neven if the program had a legitimate secular purpose, it\nnonetheless had the impermissible effect of advancing\nreligion; and (2) the program gave rise to a public percep-\ntion that the State was endorsing religious practices and\nbeliefs. Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris et al.,\n2001 WL 1636772 at *12, *37-*38. The Court rejected these\narguments, emphasizing that the voucher program was\none of “true private choice.” 536 U.S. at 563, 122 S. Ct.\nat 2467.\n   [W]here a government aid program is neutral with\n   respect to religion, and provides assistance directly\n   to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct gov-\n   ernment aid to religious schools wholly as a result\n   of their own genuine and independent private\n   choice, the program is not readily subject to chal-\n   lenge under the Establishment Clause. A program\n   that shares these features permits government aid\n   to reach religious institutions only by way of the\n   deliberate choices of numerous individual recipients.\n   The incidental advancement of a religious mission,\n   or the perceived endorsement of a religious\n   message, is reasonably attributable to the individual\n   recipient, not to the government, whose role ends\n   with the disbursement of benefits.\n\f26                                                        No. 13-1077\n\nId. at 652, 122 S.

Ct. at 2468.5\n  The Zelman decision supports an argument that inde-\npendent decisionmaking by an insured employee and her\nphysician severs the connection between the employer’s\nfunding of a health care plan and the use of plan money\nto pay for contraceptives.

Nonetheless, I think Zelman is\nrelevant to the extent it recognizes that the purchase\nof a good or service is not necessarily attributable to\nthe person who supplies the purchase money, when\nthe decision to make the purchase belongs entirely to\nanother individual. See Korte v. U.S. Dep’t of Health &\nHuman Servs., 2012 WL 6553996, at *10 (“Any inference\nof support for contraception stemming from complying\nwith the neutral and generally applicable mandate is\na de minimus burden.”).\n   Again, the Grotes can and do argue that because\nGrote Industries’ health plan is self-funded, they—through\ntheir businesses—are paying directly for contracep-\ntive care rather than handing employees a voucher that\nthey can use as they wish. I would simply add that\nthe decision whether to self-fund a health plan rather\nthan to purchase coverage from an insurance carrier\n(which would be closer to a voucher) is a decision made\nby the employer, likely in part or in whole for economic\nreasons. One effect of that arrangement, voluntarily\nundertaken by the employer, is that it places the\nemployer financially closer to the employee’s health care\nchoices. Thus, to the extent the self-funded nature of a\nhealth plan is a “crucial” factor in determining whether\nthe plan’s mandated coverage of contraceptive care\nburdens an employer’s religious liberties, see Tyndale\nHouse Publishers, 2012 WL 5817323, at *13, one ought to\nacknowledge that the self-funding arrangement is one\nof the employer’s making—and possibly one having\nlittle or nothing to do with the employer’s religious\nbeliefs—rather than the government’s. See Autocam,\n2012 WL 6845677, at *6 & n.1.\n\f28                                                No. 13-1077\n\n  Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Southworth, 529\nU.S. 217, 120 S. Ct. 1346 (2000), is a second precedent that\nshould be considered on the subject of funding. At issue\nin Southworth was a segregated activity fee that all\nstudents at the University of Wisconsin were required\nto pay to support various campus services and activities.\nOne portion of that fee was allocated to support the\nactivities of more than 600 registered student organiza-\ntions, some of which engaged in political and ideological\nexpression. Organizations primarily obtained funding\nby applying to one of two funds administered by the\nstudent government, which reviewed such applications\non a viewpoint-neutral basis. Students who objected to\nthis arrangement filed suit contending that funding the\nstudent organizations by means of a dedicated, manda-\ntory fee violated their First Amendment right to free\nspeech; they argued that the university was obligated\nto give them the choice not to fund student organiza-\ntions which engaged in political and ideological expres-\nsion that was contrary to their personal beliefs.\n  In Southworth v. Grebe, 151 F.3d 717 (7th Cir. 1998), this\ncourt agreed that the fee system violated the students’\nfree speech rights, relying on such compelled-speech\nprecedents as Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 97\nS. Ct. 1782 (1977) (union member cannot be compelled\nto pay service fee used by union to support political\ncandidates and express political views unrelated to its\nduties as bargaining representative of employees), and\nKeller v. State Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1, 110 S. Ct. 2228 (1990)\n(although lawyer could be compelled to join state bar\nassociation and fund activities germane to association’s\n\fNo. 13-1077                                              29\n\nregulatory mission, he could not be required to fund\nassociation’s political expression). We observed:\n   The students, like the objecting union members\n   in Abood, have a First Amendment interest in not\n   being compelled to contribute to an organization\n   whose expressive activities conflict with one’s “free-\n   dom of belief.” Glickman [v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott,\n   Inc.], 521 U.S. [457] at [471], 117 S. Ct. [2130] at 2139\n   [(1997)]. And here, unlike Glickman, requiring the\n   students to pay the mandatory student activity fees\n   does engender a crisis of conscience. Glickman, 117\n   S. Ct. at 2130. Finally, in the words of the Glickman\n   Court: “compelled contributions for political pur-\n   poses . . . implicated First Amendment interests be-\n   cause they interfere with the values lying at the ‘heart\n   of the First Amendment[—]the notion that an indi-\n   vidual should be free to believe as he will, and that\n   in a free society one’s beliefs should be shaped by his\n   mind and his conscience rather than coerced by the\n   State.’ ” Id. at 2139 (quoting Abood, 431 U.S. at 234-35,\n   97 S. Ct. 1782). In essence, allowing the compelled\n   funding in this case would undermine any right\n   to “freedom of belief.” We would be saying that\n   students like the plaintiffs are free to believe what\n   they wish, but they still must fund organizations\n   espousing beliefs they reject. Thus, while they have\n   the right to believe what they choose, they neverthe-\n   less must fund what they don’t believe.\n151 F.3d at 731 (footnote omitted).\n  The Supreme Court unanimously reversed our hold-\ning. The Court recognized at the start “that the complain-\n\f30                                              No. 13-1077\n\ning students are being required to pay fees which\nare subsidies for speech they find objectionable, even\noffensive.” 529 U.S. at 230, 120 S. Ct. at 1354. It fur-\nther acknowledged that the students’ First Amend-\nment objection to funding such speech followed log-\nically from cases such as Abood and Keller. Id. at 231,\n120 S. Ct. at 1355. Yet, the Court was unwilling to\nrequire the university to permit students to opt out\nof funding organizations whose speech they found ob-\njectionable. A university could voluntarily elect to grant\nstudents such an opportunity, the Court noted, but it\nwas not constitutionally compelled to do so. Id. at 232,\n120 S. Ct. at 1355-56. The Court did agree and affirm\nthat the University was required to protect its students’\nFirst Amendment interests. Id. at 233, 120 S. Ct. at 1356.\nBut doing so did not require the University to relieve\nstudents of the obligation to pay the fee used to fund\nobjectionable speech, the Court reasoned. Rather, looking\nto public forum precedents, id. at 229-30, 120 S. Ct. at\n1354, the Court concluded that “[t]he proper measure,\nand the principal standard of protection for objecting\nstudents, . . . is the requirement of viewpoint neutrality\nin the allocation of funding support,” id. at 233, 120 S. Ct.\nat 1356. The Court explained that, given the university’s\ngoal of fostering open discussion by and among students,\nviewpoint neutrality in funding student speech repre-\nsented “the justification for requiring the student to pay\nfee in the first instance and for ensuring the integrity of\nthe program’s operation once the funds have been col-\nlected.” Ibid. It would protect students by ensuring “that\nminority views are treated with the same respect as\n\fNo. 13-1077                                               31\n\nare majority views,” and consequently that all students\nwere given access to the forum of extracurricular\nstudent activities, id. at 235, 120 S. Ct. at 1357, and by\npreventing any erroneous impression that any indi-\nvidual student organization speaks for the university,\nid. at 233, 120 S. Ct. at 1356 (quoting Rosenberger v.\nRector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 841, 115\nS. Ct. 2510, 2523 (1995)). As it was stipulated that\nfunding requests submitted by student organizations to\nthe student government at the University of Wisconsin\nwere, indeed, reviewed on a viewpoint neutral basis, the\nCourt concluded that the university’s funding system\nwas consistent with the First Amendment. Id. at 234,\n120 S. Ct. at 1356.6\n  Although Southworth, too, may be distinguished\nfrom this case, which concerns a religious objection to\nfunding a particular category of medical care, it nonethe-\nless has some relevance to the Grotes’ claims. Southworth\nrecognizes that the compulsion to fund speech by others\nthat an individual finds objectionable does not invariably\nconstitute a violation of his own right to free speech;\nrather, so long as one is paying into a fund from which\n\n\n6\n   There was an alternative means by which student organiza-\ntions might seek funding through a student referendum\nprocess. The Court noted that “[t]o the extent the referendum\nsubstitutes majority determinations for viewpoint neutrality\nit would undermine the constitutional protection the program\nrequries.” Id. at 235, 120 S. Ct. at 1357. As the record was\nnot well-developed on this avenue of funding, the Court\ntherefore remanded the case for further exploration of that\npoint. Id. at 235-36, 120 S. Ct. at 1357.\n\f32                                              No. 13-1077\n\nthe expression of a variety of viewpoints is funded on\na neutral basis, the rights of the individual paying\ninto that fund are sufficiently protected. The Grotes, of\ncourse, are objecting to funding contraception, not\nspeech; but what their company is actually required to\nfund is a health insurance plan that covers many medical\nservices, not just contraception. The obligation to fund\na health plan is generally applicable and neutral in the\nsense that the services that must be covered by the\nplan have not been chosen on the basis of religion. More-\nover, the decision as to what services will be used is left\nto the employee and her doctor. To the extent the Grotes\nthemselves are funding anything at all—and as I have\ndiscussed, one must disregard the corporate form to\nsay that they are—they are paying for a plan that insures\na comprehensive range of medical care that will be used\nin countless ways by the hundreds of U.S.-based employ-\nees participating in the Grote Industries health plan.\nNo individual decision by an employee and her physi-\ncian—be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or\nhave a hip replaced—is in any meaningful sense the\nGrotes’ decision or action. See Southworth, 529 U.S. at 239-\n40, 120 S. Ct. at 1359 (Souter, J., concurring in the judg-\nment) (distinguishing use of activity to fee to “indirectly\nfund[ ] the jumble of other speakers’ messages” from\ncases in which government “restrict[s] or modif[ies] the\nmessage a student wishes to express,” “require[s] an\nindividual to bear an offensive statement personally,” or\ncompels the objecting individual “to affirm a moral\nor political commitment”).\n  The significance of private decisionmaking by the\ninsured employee is worth discussing in one last re-\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                   33\n\nspect. Heretofore, there has a been a general under-\nstanding that an employer, by virtue of paying (whether\nin part or in whole) for an employee’s health care, does\nnot become a party to the employee’s health care\ndecisions: the employer acquires no right to intrude\nupon the employee’s relationship with her physician\nand participate in her medical decisions, nor, conversely,\ndoes it incur responsibility for the quality and results\nof an employee’s health care if it is not actually\ndelivering that care to the employee. This litigation\nseeks in a sense to upend that traditional under-\nstanding, by postulating that when a company insures\nits employees’ health care, a company owner indeed is a\nparty to that care, with a cognizable religious interest\nin what services are made available to the employee.\n  The obligation to pay for contraceptive coverage\nis the current hot topic in federal litigation, 7\nbecause the federal contraception mandate is new. 8 But\n\n\n7\n  By one judge’s count, some forty lawsuits have been filed\nchallenging the mandate. See Catholic Diocese of Peoria v.\nSebelius, 2013 WL 74240, at *1 & n.1 (C.D. Ill. Jan. 4, 2013)\n(coll. cases).\n8\n   Parallel mandates applicable to insurers and group insurance\nplans have existed at the state level for a number of years.\nBeginning with Maryland in 1998, some twenty-eight States\nhad adopted mandates requiring insurers to include coverage\nof prescription contraceptives by the time the federal mandate\ntook effect in 2012. See National Women’s Law Center, Guaran-\nteeing Coverage of Contraceptives: Past & Present (Aug. 1, 2012),\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f34                                                       No. 13-1077\n\ncontraceptive care is by no means the sole form of\nhealth care that implicates religious concerns. To cite a\nfew examples: artificial insemination and other repro-\nductive technologies; genetic screening, counseling, and\ngene therapy; preventative and remedial treatment for\nsexually-transmitted diseases; sex reassignment; vac-\ncination; organ transplantation from deceased donors;\nblood transfusions; stem cell therapies; end-of-life care,\nincluding the initiation and termination of life sup-\nport; and, for some religions, virtually all conventional\nmedical treatments. If the RFRA entitles the controlling\nshareholder of a corporation to exclude coverage\nfor contraceptive care from the company’s health plan\non the basis of his religious beliefs, then, as I noted in\nKorte v. Sebelius, 2012 WL 6757353, at *5, and as\nJudge Barker noted below, see Grote Indus., 2012 WL\n6725905, at *6, I can see no reason why coverage for\nany number of medical services could not also be\n\n\n\n8\n   (...continued)\navailable at http://www.nwlc.org/resource/guaranteeing-\ncoverage-contraceptives-past-and-present (last visited Jan. 27,\n2013); Guttmacher Institute, S TATE P OLICIES IN B RIEF , Insurance\nCoverage of Contraceptives (as of Jan. 1, 2013), available at\nhttp://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_ICC.pdf\n(last visited Jan. 27, 2013). Due in part to these mandates, nine\nin ten employer-based insurance plans were already covering\nprescription contraceptives by that time. Guttmacher Institute,\nF ACT S HEET , Contraceptive Use in the United States, at 4 (July 2012),\navailable at http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_contr_use.html\n(last visited Jan. 27, 2013).\n\fNo. 13-1077                                              35\n\nexcluded from a workplace health plan on the same\nbasis. In part, this is a point that addresses a separate\nconsideration under the RFRA—whether there are rea-\nsonable alternatives to requiring employer-sponsored\ncoverage of the objected-to form of care, and thus\nwhether the insurance mandate is the least restrictive\nmeans of ensuring access to that care. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(b)(2). But I think it also helps to place in con-\ntext the nature of the burden that is being asserted\nin this litigation. Medical decisions are made in private\non an individual basis. Any given medical decision,\ndepending on the nature of the patient’s condition, the\navailable treatments, and the circumstances confronted\nby doctor and patient, might be inconsistent with the\nreligious beliefs of one or more owners of the company\nthat sponsors the patient’s workplace insurance. Holding\nthat a company shareholder’s religious beliefs and prac-\ntices are implicated by the autonomous health care deci-\nsions of company employees, such that the obligation\nto insure those decisions, when objected to by a share-\nholder, represents a substantial burden on that share-\nholder’s religious liberties, strikes me as an unusually\nexpansive understanding of what acts in the com-\nmercial sphere meaningfully interfere with an indi-\nvidual’s religious beliefs and practices.\n  These and other issues will be fleshed out as the merits\nof this appeal are briefed. But the Grotes have not yet\nconvinced me that whatever burden the contraception\nmandate imposes on the exercise of their religious\nfreedom is a substantial burden, in the sense that it\ndirectly affects the exercise of their Catholic faith.

Dec. 28, 2012). As explained below, this case is\nmaterially indistinguishable. Accordingly, we consolidate\nthis case with Korte and likewise grant the motion here.\n   The Grote Family owns Grote Industries, a privately\nheld, family-run business headquartered in Madison,\nIndiana. Grote Industries manufactures vehicle safety\nsystems. The company has 1,148 full-time employees\nworking at various locations and provides a group health-\ninsurance plan for the benefit of its employees. The plan\nis self-insured and renews every year on January 1.\n  The members of the Grote Family are Catholic and\noperate their business in accordance with the precepts\nof their faith, including the Catholic Church’s teachings\nregarding the moral wrongfulness of abortifacient drugs,\ncontraception, and sterilization. Consistent with the\nGrote Family’s religious commitments, before January 1,\n2013, the Grote Industries health-insurance plan did not\ncover abortifacient drugs, contraception, or sterilization.\n  The ACA and accompanying regulations mandate that\nthe Grote Industries health-insurance plan provide no-\ncost coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptives,\nsterilization procedures, and related services. In brief,\nthe regulatory framework imposing this mandate is as\n\n\n1\n  (...continued)\nfully own Grote Industries, Inc.

Reg. 8725 (Feb. 15,\n2012) (“the contraception mandate” or “the man-\ndate”). This includes oral contraceptives with possible\nabortifacient effect (including emergency contraception\nsuch as the “morning-after pill”) and intrauterine devices.\nSee id.; O FFICE OF W OMEN’S H EALTH, F OOD & D RUG\nA DMIN., B IRTH C ONTROL G UIDE 10-12, 16-20 (2012),\nhttp://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsum ers/\nByAudience/ForWomen/FreePublications/UCM282014.pdf.\n   The contraception mandate takes effect starting in the\nfirst plan year after August 1, 2012. See 77 Fed. Reg. at\n8725-26. Because the Grote Industries health-insurance\nplan renews on January 1 of each year, the mandate\nrequired the company to begin covering oral contracep-\ntion, sterilization procedures, intrauterine devices, and\nemergency contraception when the plan renewed on\nJanuary 1, 2013. The mandate is backed by heavy\nfinancial penalties; employers who do not comply face\nenforcement actions, see 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a); a penalty of\n$100 per day per employee, see 26 U.S.C. § 4980D(a)-(b);\nand an annual tax surcharge of $2,000 per employee, see\nid. § 4980H.\n The Grote Family and Grote Industries filed suit on\nOctober 29, 2012, seeking declaratory and injunctive\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                 5\n\nrelief blocking the enforcement of the contraception\nmandate against them.

The Kortes’ company, K & L Contractors,\nprovided a group health-insurance plan for its nonunion\nemployees. In August 2012 the Kortes discovered that\nthe plan included coverage for contraception and\nwanted to replace it with a plan that conforms to the\nrequirements of their faith, but the contraception man-\ndate prevented them from doing so. Id. They sued the\nHHS Secretary asserting (among other claims for relief)\nthat the mandate violated their rights under RFRA. They\nmoved for a preliminary injunction, but the district court\ndenied the motion. The Kortes and their company (col-\nlectively, “the Kortes”) appealed. They asked us for an\ninjunction pending appeal, and we granted the motion.\nReserving plenary review for later in the appeal, we\nheld that the Kortes had established a reasonable likeli-\nhood of success on their RFRA claim. Id. at *3-4. We\nalso held that the equitable balance tipped in favor of\ngranting the injunction; the harm to the Kortes’ religious-\nliberty rights outweighed the temporary harm to the\ngovernment’s interest in providing greater access to cost-\nfree contraception and related services. Id. at *4-5.\n   In all important respects, this case is identical to\nKorte; our analysis there applies with equal force here. If\nanything, the Grote Family and Grote Industries have a\nmore compelling case for an injunction pending appeal.\nUnlike the health-insurance plan at issue in Korte, the\nGrote Industries health plan is self-insured and has\nnever provided contraception coverage. Absent an in-\njunction, the Grote Family and Grote Industries must\nnow cover abortifacient drugs, contraception, and ster-\nilization through the company’s self-insured health\nplan. Thus, the only factual distinctions between the two\n\f8                                               No. 13-1077\n\ncases actually strengthen the equities in favor of granting\nan injunction pending appeal.\n  And the legal analysis has not changed. The Grote\nFamily and Grote Industries make essentially the same\narguments as did the Kortes. They maintain that the\nlegal duties imposed on them by the contraception man-\ndate conflict with the religious duties required by their\nfaith, and they cannot comply with both. The mandate,\nthey contend, compels them to materially cooperate in a\ngrave moral wrong contrary to the teachings of their\nchurch and levies severe financial penalties if they do\nnot comply. In this way, they argue, the mandate sub-\nstantially burdens their free-exercise rights, triggering\nthe strict-scrutiny test codified in RFRA. As we noted in\nKorte, this “is an exacting standard, and the government\nbears the burden of satisfying it.” Id. at *2.\n  In response the government advances the same argu-\nments as it did in Korte. To abbreviate, the govern-\nment maintains that (1) a secular, for-profit corporation\ncannot assert a claim under RFRA; (2) relatedly, the free-\nexercise rights of the individual plaintiffs are not affected\nbecause their corporation is a separate legal entity; and\n(3) the mandate’s burden on their free-exercise rights is\ntoo remote and attenuated to qualify as “substantial”\nunder RFRA because the decision to use contracep-\ntion benefits is made by third parties—individual em-\nployees, in consultation with their medical providers.\nWe addressed these arguments in our order in Korte, and\nnothing presented here requires us to reconsider that\nprior ruling. Here, as in Korte, the Grote Family’s use\nof the corporate form is not dispositive of the claim.\n\fNo. 13-1077                                              9\n\nSee Korte, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6757353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (citing Citizens United\nv.

And the\ngovernment’s minimalist characterization of the burden\ncontinues to obscure the substance of the religious-liberty\nviolation asserted here. Id. The members of the Grote\nFamily contend that their faith forbids them to facilitate\naccess to contraception by paying for it, as the\nmandate requires them to do.\n  And as in Korte, the government has not, at this\njuncture, made an effort to satisfy strict scrutiny. In\nparticular, it has not demonstrated that requiring\nreligious objectors to provide cost-free contraception\ncoverage is the least restrictive means of increasing\naccess to contraception. Although we again reserve\nplenary review of the merits for later in this appeal, for\nthe reasons explained more thoroughly in our order in\nKorte, id. at *2-5, we conclude that the Grote Family and\nGrote Industries have established a reasonable likelihood\nof success on the merits of their RFRA claim.

As a result of the\ncourt’s decision to consolidate this appeal with Korte\nv.

I recognize that the arguments in favor\nof preliminary relief in Grote are in some ways stronger\nthan those in Korte (for example, the Grotes’ company\nwas not already covering contraceptive care when the\nnew federal mandate took effect, whereas the Kortes’\ncompany was). Despite the differences between the\ntwo appeals, I am no more persuaded that preliminary\ninjunctive relief is warranted in Grote than I was in Korte.\nSpecifically, the appellants have not, in my view, shown\nthat they are reasonably likely to prevail on the merits of\ntheir claims.

Grote Industries (by which I mean to\ninclude both Grote Industries, LLC and Grote Industries,\nInc.) is a secular, for-profit business engaged in the manu-\nfacture of vehicle safety systems. So far as the limited\nrecord before us reveals, it has stated no religious goals\n\f12                                                No. 13-1077\n\nas part of its mission, it does not select its employees,\nvendors, or customers on the basis of their religious\nbeliefs, and it does not require its employees to conform\ntheir behavior to any particular religious precepts.

At issue\nin Southworth was a segregated activity fee that all\nstudents at the University of Wisconsin were required\nto pay to support various campus services and activities.\nOne portion of that fee was allocated to support the\nactivities of more than 600 registered student organiza-\ntions, some of which engaged in political and ideological\nexpression. Organizations primarily obtained funding\nby applying to one of two funds administered by the\nstudent government, which reviewed such applications\non a viewpoint-neutral basis. Students who objected to\nthis arrangement filed suit contending that funding the\nstudent organizations by means of a dedicated, manda-\ntory fee violated their First Amendment right to free\nspeech; they argued that the university was obligated\nto give them the choice not to fund student organiza-\ntions which engaged in political and ideological expres-\nsion that was contrary to their personal beliefs.\n  In Southworth v.

In essence, allowing the compelled\n   funding in this case would undermine any right\n   to “freedom of belief.” We would be saying that\n   students like the plaintiffs are free to believe what\n   they wish, but they still must fund organizations\n   espousing beliefs they reject. Thus, while they have\n   the right to believe what they choose, they neverthe-\n   less must fund what they don’t believe.\n151 F.3d at 731 (footnote omitted).\n  The Supreme Court unanimously reversed our hold-\ning. The Court recognized at the start “that the complain-\n\f30                                              No. 13-1077\n\ning students are being required to pay fees which\nare subsidies for speech they find objectionable, even\noffensive.” 529 U.S. at 230, 120 S. Ct. at 1354. It fur-\nther acknowledged that the students’ First Amend-\nment objection to funding such speech followed log-\nically from cases such as Abood and Keller. Id. at 231,\n120 S. Ct. at 1355. Yet, the Court was unwilling to\nrequire the university to permit students to opt out\nof funding organizations whose speech they found ob-\njectionable. A university could voluntarily elect to grant\nstudents such an opportunity, the Court noted, but it\nwas not constitutionally compelled to do so. Id. at 232,\n120 S. Ct. at 1355-56. The Court did agree and affirm\nthat the University was required to protect its students’\nFirst Amendment interests. Id. at 233, 120 S. Ct. at 1356.\nBut doing so did not require the University to relieve\nstudents of the obligation to pay the fee used to fund\nobjectionable speech, the Court reasoned. Rather, looking\nto public forum precedents, id. at 229-30, 120 S. Ct. at\n1354, the Court concluded that “[t]he proper measure,\nand the principal standard of protection for objecting\nstudents, . . . is the requirement of viewpoint neutrality\nin the allocation of funding support,” id. at 233, 120 S. Ct.\nat 1356. The Court explained that, given the university’s\ngoal of fostering open discussion by and among students,\nviewpoint neutrality in funding student speech repre-\nsented “the justification for requiring the student to pay\nfee in the first instance and for ensuring the integrity of\nthe program’s operation once the funds have been col-\nlected.” Ibid. It would protect students by ensuring “that\nminority views are treated with the same respect as\n\fNo. 13-1077                                               31\n\nare majority views,” and consequently that all students\nwere given access to the forum of extracurricular\nstudent activities, id. at 235, 120 S.

As it was stipulated that\nfunding requests submitted by student organizations to\nthe student government at the University of Wisconsin\nwere, indeed, reviewed on a viewpoint neutral basis, the\nCourt concluded that the university’s funding system\nwas consistent with the First Amendment. Id. at 234,\n120 S. Ct. at 1356.6\n  Although Southworth, too, may be distinguished\nfrom this case, which concerns a religious objection to\nfunding a particular category of medical care, it nonethe-\nless has some relevance to the Grotes’ claims. Southworth\nrecognizes that the compulsion to fund speech by others\nthat an individual finds objectionable does not invariably\nconstitute a violation of his own right to free speech;\nrather, so long as one is paying into a fund from which\n\n\n6\n   There was an alternative means by which student organiza-\ntions might seek funding through a student referendum\nprocess. The Court noted that “[t]o the extent the referendum\nsubstitutes majority determinations for viewpoint neutrality\nit would undermine the constitutional protection the program\nrequries.” Id. at 235, 120 S. Ct. at 1357. As the record was\nnot well-developed on this avenue of funding, the Court\ntherefore remanded the case for further exploration of that\npoint. Id. at 235-36, 120 S.

The Grotes, of\ncourse, are objecting to funding contraception, not\nspeech; but what their company is actually required to\nfund is a health insurance plan that covers many medical\nservices, not just contraception. The obligation to fund\na health plan is generally applicable and neutral in the\nsense that the services that must be covered by the\nplan have not been chosen on the basis of religion. More-\nover, the decision as to what services will be used is left\nto the employee and her doctor. To the extent the Grotes\nthemselves are funding anything at all—and as I have\ndiscussed, one must disregard the corporate form to\nsay that they are—they are paying for a plan that insures\na comprehensive range of medical care that will be used\nin countless ways by the hundreds of U.S.-based employ-\nees participating in the Grote Industries health plan.\nNo individual decision by an employee and her physi-\ncian—be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or\nhave a hip replaced—is in any meaningful sense the\nGrotes’ decision or action. See Southworth, 529 U.S. at 239-\n40, 120 S. Ct. at 1359 (Souter, J., concurring in the judg-\nment) (distinguishing use of activity to fee to “indirectly\nfund[ ] the jumble of other speakers’ messages” from\ncases in which government “restrict[s] or modif[ies] the\nmessage a student wishes to express,” “require[s] an\nindividual to bear an offensive statement personally,” or\ncompels the objecting individual “to affirm a moral\nor political commitment”).\n  The significance of private decisionmaking by the\ninsured employee is worth discussing in one last re-\n\fNo. 13-1077                                                   33\n\nspect. Heretofore, there has a been a general under-\nstanding that an employer, by virtue of paying (whether\nin part or in whole) for an employee’s health care, does\nnot become a party to the employee’s health care\ndecisions: the employer acquires no right to intrude\nupon the employee’s relationship with her physician\nand participate in her medical decisions, nor, conversely,\ndoes it incur responsibility for the quality and results\nof an employee’s health care if it is not actually\ndelivering that care to the employee. This litigation\nseeks in a sense to upend that traditional under-\nstanding, by postulating that when a company insures\nits employees’ health care, a company owner indeed is a\nparty to that care, with a cognizable religious interest\nin what services are made available to the employee.\n  The obligation to pay for contraceptive coverage\nis the current hot topic in federal litigation, 7\nbecause the federal contraception mandate is new. 8 But\n\n\n7\n  By one judge’s count, some forty lawsuits have been filed\nchallenging the mandate.

See National Women’s Law Center, Guaran-\nteeing Coverage of Contraceptives: Past & Present (Aug. 1, 2012),\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f34                                                       No. 13-1077\n\ncontraceptive care is by no means the sole form of\nhealth care that implicates religious concerns.

In part, this is a point that addresses a separate\nconsideration under the RFRA—whether there are rea-\nsonable alternatives to requiring employer-sponsored\ncoverage of the objected-to form of care, and thus\nwhether the insurance mandate is the least restrictive\nmeans of ensuring access to that care. See 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000bb-1(b)(2). But I think it also helps to place in con-\ntext the nature of the burden that is being asserted\nin this litigation. Medical decisions are made in private\non an individual basis. Any given medical decision,\ndepending on the nature of the patient’s condition, the\navailable treatments, and the circumstances confronted\nby doctor and patient, might be inconsistent with the\nreligious beliefs of one or more owners of the company\nthat sponsors the patient’s workplace insurance. Holding\nthat a company shareholder’s religious beliefs and prac-\ntices are implicated by the autonomous health care deci-\nsions of company employees, such that the obligation\nto insure those decisions, when objected to by a share-\nholder, represents a substantial burden on that share-\nholder’s religious liberties, strikes me as an unusually\nexpansive understanding of what acts in the com-\nmercial sphere meaningfully interfere with an indi-\nvidual’s religious beliefs and practices.\n  These and other issues will be fleshed out as the merits\nof this appeal are briefed. But the Grotes have not yet\nconvinced me that whatever burden the contraception\nmandate imposes on the exercise of their religious\nfreedom is a substantial burden, in the sense that it\ndirectly affects the exercise of their Catholic faith.
