J. —                In this consolidated appeal, Hal and Melanie Moore and Lester and\n\nBetty Krueger ( collectively, the Moores) appeal two trial court orders that ( 1) dismissed their\nclaims against         Steven        and   Mary   Lou Love   and   Steve'   s   Outboard Service ( SOS), ( 2) awarded\n\n\nattorney fees to the Loves, and ( 3) refused to consider additional evidence after we remanded the\n\nMoores' first appeal to the trial court to enter more complete findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. The Moores had sued SOS and the Loves, asserting claims of nuisance in fact, nuisance per\n\nse, and violations of            the Shoreline Management Act (SMA). 1                 The Moores now argue that the\n\ntrial   court erred        by ( 1)   refusing to    consider additional evidence after remand, (       2) entering\n\nfindings       of   fact   unsupported      by    substantial evidence, (       3) concluding that the Moores showed no\n\nnuisance in fact, (4) concluding that the Moores showed no nuisance per se, and ( 5) granting\n\n1\n    Chapter 90. 58 RCW.\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nattorney fees. We reverse the trial court' s dismissal of the Moores' nuisance per se claim and its\n\nattorney fee award and remand for further proceedings. We affirm the trial court' s dismissal of\nthe Moores' other claims.\n\n\n                                                       FACTS\n\n\n         Steve' s Outboard Service ( SOS) is an outboard motor repair sole proprietorship that\n\n\nSteven Love and Mary Lou Love have owned since 1994, and that Steven has operated from\n\ntheir home along State Route ( SR) 106, on the south shore of Hood Canal in Mason County. In\n\n2006, the Moores sued SOS and the Loves, alleging that SOS' s operations constituted a nuisance\n\nand a violation of the Shoreline Management Act.3\n\nA.       The Moores' Case at Trial\n\n\n         The Moores presented two witnesses during this bench trial: Betty Krueger and Melanie\n\nMoore.\n\n\n          1.   Betty Krueger\n\n         Krueger testified that SOS affected her by generating smoke, fumes, and noise from\n\n           engines.     Krueger testified that     smoke and   fumes from SOS     reached   her property. She\nrevving\n\n\nalso testified that SOS caused traffic safety hazards because customers and delivery vehicles\n\nused the SR 106 right -of way, although she admitted that no serious accidents had occurred on\n                          -\n\n\n2\n    For purposes of clarity, we refer to Hal and Melanie Moore and Lester and Betty Krueger\n                as \"   the Moores.\"   We   refer   to Steven Love   and   Mary   Lou Love   as \"   the Loves.\" We\ncollectively\nrefer to individuals by their first names when referring to them individually. We intend no\n disrespect.\n\n\n 3 The Moores also sued Mason County for failure to enforce the SMA against SOS. But the trial\n court dismissed the Moores' claim against Mason County on summary judgment. The Moores\n assign no error to this dismissal.\n\n\n                                                          PA\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\nSR 106. Krueger testified that SOS made periodic noise when revving boat engines, and\n\noperating a tractor with a beeping device to bring boats onto the Loves' property. Krueger also\n\ntestified that she no longer used a patio on the side of her house that faced SR 106 because of the\n\nnoise SOS generated. Krueger admitted that her caretaker frequently used a gas powered leaf\n\nblower and pressure washer that made noise. Krueger testified that SOS' s customers and\n\n\ndelivery trucks used the SR 106 right -of way, potentially impeding traffic and causing safety\n                                          -\n\nconcerns.\n\n\n\n\n          The Moores submitted photographs showing several plumes or hazes of smoke,\n\npurportedly from SOS. Krueger testified that she saw such smoke in the spring, summer, and\n\nfall,   and   that she periodically smelled   exhaust   fumes from the   smoke.   She further testified that\n\n\nshe was not seeking damages, but only wanted SOS' s operation stopped.\n\n          2. Melanie Moore\n\n\n              Melanie Moore owned a home on SR 106, across the street from the Loves' property,\n\nwhere she lived during the summer. Although Moore provided testimony regarding the\n\nfrequency and volume of the noise that SOS produced; the trial court found that this testimony\n\nwas not credible, and we defer to that determination of credibility.\n\n          Moore testified that although she-had heard the beeping of SOS' s tractor, Steven had\n\nsince disengaged the beeper. Moore testified that on windless summer days she could see smoke\n\nand smell fumes SOS generated. Moore testified that smoke and fumes occasionally presented a\n\nproblem on       her property.\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -I1           1\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -11\n\n\n        Moore testified to many concerns she had regarding SOS' s use of SR 106 and this\n\nroadside. And she testified that she wanted only to prevent SOS from operating out of the\n\nLoves' property.\n\n        3.   Evidence Regarding Permitting\n\n        Because the Moores claimed nuisance per se, they submitted documentary evidence\n\nregarding various permits that Steven may or may not have obtained. This included a shoreline\n\npermit application that Steven filed in 1994 to build a 30 -by 45 -foot metal building on his\n\nproperty, a letter from Steven withdrawing this application, and a letter from Mason County\n\nacknowledging Steven' s withdrawal letter. The Moores also submitted building permit\n\napplications filed in 1994 that requested permits to replace a carport and to remodel a storage\n\n\nshed.\n\n\n\n\n        The Moores      submitted a report   from Mason   County   entitled \"   Case   Activity Listing.\"   Ex.\n\n\n7. The Case Activity Listing listed the permits that Mason County employees believed the\n\ncounty had granted to Steven over the years, and briefly described those permits. This Case\n\nActivity Listing showed that the County received and investigated a complaint about SOS' s\noperation    in 2003.   Additionally, the Case Activity Listing stated that Mason County had\n\npreviously granted Steven two building permits for a single metal shop. However, Steven had\n\nwithdrawn his metal shop permit applications while they were pending.\n\n        The Case Activity Listing also stated that subsequent to granting the metal shop building\n\npermits, Mason County granted Steven both a 1994 carport permit and a permit for Steven to\n\nbuild an addition to the storage shed. Mason County granted these two permits for private use\n\nunder the old Uniform Building Code.\n\n\n\n                                                    S\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n       The Case Activity Listing stated that the carport permit revealed that the carport had\n\nreplaced another structure. However, because Mason County had not granted the two older\n\nmetal shop permits, it could not find physical copies of these permits. Nonetheless, Mason\n\nCounty assumed that the planner who had reviewed the carport permit application approved the\n\ncarport' permit on grounds that the structure was of equal or lesser intensity than the permitted\n\nmetal shop it had replaced. The Case Activity Listing stated that SOS could continue operating\n\nas an existing cottage industry, because SOS' s operation had not substantially changed since its\n\nstart in 1994.\n\n\nB.      The Loves' Case at Trial\n\n\n        1.    The Loves' Neighbors\n\n\n        The Loves presented the testimony of three neighbors who lived near the Loves'\n\nproperty: James David, William Jacobs, and Elliot Gordon.\n\n        David testified that he generally did not use the SR 106 side of his property due to the\n\nroad noise. He testified that SOS only ran engines for \" minutes\" and that SOS' s operations\n\nbothered     neither   David   nor   his    guests.   1 Verbatim Report   of   Proceedings ( VRP)   at   125. David\n\n\ntestified that motorcycles on SR 106 produced the loudest source of noise, while SOS was about\n\nas loud as the Kruegers' leaf blower. He further testified that SOS produced no fumes.\n\n        Jacobs testified that the noise, fumes, or smoke from SOS had never bothered him.\n\nJacobs confirmed that the Kruegers used a leaf blower daily when leaves were falling. Jacobs\n\nhad not observed any traffic safety problems at SOS.\n\n        Gordon testified that SOS              produced   no odors or   fumes. Gordon testified that just about\n\n\neveryone parked        their   boats   on   the         of way.\n                                                  right -  -      Gordon testified that he knew   of no   traffic\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -11\n\n\nsafety problems caused by SOS, and that Steven used safety precautions when moving boats into\n\nthe Loves' shop. Gordon also testified that SOS' s engine noises did not bother him, and that\n\nmotorcycles on SR 106 bothered him more.\n\n\n       2. SOS' s Customers\n\n\n       The Loves presented the testimony of several of SOS' s customers who had their outboard\n\nmotors serviced at    SOS.    These customers uniformly testified-that Steven was highly safety\n\nconscious, never caused traffic problems, had a procedure to quickly remove boats from the\n\nroad, and used appointments to ensure that SOS was never overwhelmed with boats. Two\n\ncustomers testified that SR 106 regularly had numerous boats, delivery trucks, and other vehicles\n\nparked on its shoulder. Two customers testified to their ability to talk to Steven in his shop with\n\nthe motors running.\n\n        3. Steven Love\n\n\n        Steven testified on his own behalf. Steven testified that he worked on motors usually\n\nbetween 10: 30 AM and 5: 00 PM, that he typically ran motors for 15 minutes per day at the most,.\n\nand that he ran the motors on idle 95 per cent of that time. He also testified that he generally ran\n\nmotors on open throttle for no more than 30 seconds.\n\n\n        Regarding smoke production, Steven testified that while he used to do a \" fogging\"\n\nprocedure that produced a lot of smoke, he had not done it since 2000. 2 VRP at 323 -24. He\n\ntestified that two   photos   showing   smoke at   his property   occurred   before 2001.   Steven also\n\n\ntestified that while he did not do anything in his shop that caused excessive smoke, he sometimes\n\nused a wood stove that made smoke.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       0\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n         Regarding the permitting of the structures on his property, Steven testified that he\n\nreplaced a carport attached to his house with a larger carport. Steven testified that as far as he\n\nknew, his contractor had obtained the proper permits for the carport. Steven also testified that he\n\nhad no awareness of any shoreline permit for SOS.4\n          Steven testified that no one informed him that SOS was out of compliance with any law.\n\nSteven further admitted that his customers used the SR 106 right -of way when delivering boats,\n                                                                     -\n\nbut   stated   that   he did   not require   them to   do   so.    Steven testified that he stored boats on his\n\n\nproperty behind his shop or in his carports.\n\nC.        The Trial Court' s Decision\n\n\n          The trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court concluded,\n\n\n    Plaintiffs have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants' business is a\n\nnuisance nor that they are entitled to injunctive relief under any of the theories presented.\"\n\nClerk' s Papers ( CP) at 114 -15. The trial court consequently dismissed the Moores' claims.\n\n          After the trial court issued its decision, the Loves moved for, and were awarded, attorney\n\nfees in the      amount of $36,      034. 69.   The Moores appealed. After this first appeal, we remanded\n\n\nfor the trial court to produce a more complete set of findings and conclusions.\n\nD.        Post -\n               Appeal Procedural History\n\n          After remand, the Moores petitioned the trial court to reopen the case to enter a series of\n\n\npublic records        regarding the permitting      of   SOS. The Moores wanted to introduce this evidence\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Based   on   this   testimony,   the Moores    argue, \"       It was conceded at trial that Respondents did not\nhave    shoreline permits        for their business    operations.\"       Br. of Appellant at 20. But Steven simply\ntestified that he was not aware of any shoreline permit. The Loves did not concede that no\npermit existed, nor did his counsel.\n\n\n                                                                   7\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nto lend further support to their claims of nuisance in fact and nuisance per se. The trial court\n\ndenied the Moores' motion to reopen.\n\n\n          The trial court entered amended and supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. The trial court entered numerous factual findings to support its conclusions that SOS' s\n\noperation did not constitute a nuisance because, on balance, SOS' s operation did not constitute\n\nan unreasonable burden on the Moores' use and enjoyment of their land.\n\n          The trial court made no findings as to whether SOS operated lawfully. Instead, the trial\n\ncourt found that SOS operated primarily from a rebuilt carport on the Loves' property that was -\n\npermitted by Mason County. The trial court also found that the County took no action on a 2003\n\ncomplaint regarding operation of the boat repair business. The trial court found that Mason\n\nCounty allowed SOS to continue as a cottage industry.\n\n          The trial court concluded that whether SOS operated lawfully was irrelevant to both the\n\nnuisance in fact and nuisance per se claims. The trial court supported this conclusion with its\n\nstatement that both theories of nuisance require a plaintiff to establish an unreasonable\n\n\ninterference with their use and enjoyment of land, which the Moores had failed to prove.\n\n                                                                                             5\n          The trial   court   further   concluded   that the Land Use Petition Act ( LUPA)       statute of\n\n\n\n\nlimitations barred the Moores' nuisance per se claim, because Mason County had approved SOS\n\nto   operate as a \" cottage    industry.\" CP at 240 -42. The trial court stated in its conclusions that\n\n     i] n order to prevail on a claim of nuisance per se, Plaintiffs here would need to belatedly have\n\na Mason County interpretive decision regarding application of land use regulations to the Loves'\n\n\n5\n    Chapter 36. 70C RCW.\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5- II\n\n\nproperty declared improper ....\"             CP at 241 -42. The trial court reduced the Loves' attorney fee\n\naward from $36, 034. 69 to $28, 907. 44.\n\n\n         In addition to appealing the judgment dismissing their claims and awarding attorney fees\n\nto the Loves, the Moores appeal the trial court' s order refusing to reopen the case. See generally,\n\nI Br. of Appellants; III Br. of Appellants at 4; SCP at 11 - 12. We consolidated these appeals.\n\n                                                         ANALYSIS\n\n\n                     I. MOTION TO REOPEN FOR INTRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE\n\n             After remand, the Moores moved the trial court to admit evidence that SOS lacked the\n\nproper permits to operate and was, therefore, a nuisance per se. Citing Rochester v. Tulp, 54\n\nWn.2d 71, 337 P. 2d 1062 ( 1959),            the Moores argue that the trial court abused its discretion in\n\n\nrefusing to reopen the case for the introduction of this new, dispositive evidence. We disagree.6\n             A trial court' - ruling on whether to reopen a case for the introduction of new evidence is\n                            s\n\nreviewed       for   an abuse of   discretion. In   re   Ott, 37 Wn.   App.   234, 240, 679 P. 2d 372 ( 1984). A\n\n\ntrial court abuses its discretion when its decision is manifestly unreasonable, based on untenable\n\ngrounds, or made for untenable reasons. Ameriquest Mortg. Co. v. Office ofAttorney General,\n\n177 Wn.2d 467, 478, 300 P. 3d 799 ( 2013).\n\n\n             The Moores cite Rochester to support their argument that the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion      by   refusing to   reopen   for introduction   of   dispositive   evidence.   In Rochester, a\n\n\n\n\n6\n    Citing RAP 7. 2, the Loves argue that the trial court is prohibited from reopening the case after\n an appeal has started, absent explicit authorization from this court. But the decision to grant a\nmotion to reopen after a remand is within the trial court' s discretion. Zink v. City ofMesa, 162\nWn. App. 688, 706, 256 P. 3d 384 ( 2011); Sweeny v. Sweeny, 52 Wn.2d 337, 339, 324 P. 2d 1096\n    1958).\n\n\n\n\n                                                               0\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\ndefendant' s uncontroverted testimony led the trial court to rule that the statute of limitations\n\nrequired dismissal of a plaintiff' s conversion claim. 54 Wn.2d at 71 -74. After trial, records\n\n\ncame to light directly disproving the defendant' s testimony and proving that the statute of\n\nlimitations had not expired. 54 Wn.2d at' 73 -74. Our Supreme Court held that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion when it denied the plaintiff' s motion to reopen to introduce this evidence,\n\nbecause the evidence was dispositive and because the plaintiff was not at fault for failing to\n\ndiscover the   evidence   before trial. 54 Wn.2d at 74.\n\n\n        Rochester is distinguishable. Here, the Moores offer no explanation for failing to\n\nproduce the permitting evidence at trial. At the Moores' behest, the trial court admitted evidence\n\nconcerning SOS' s permitting. After remand, the Moores moved the trial court to reopen to admit\n\npublic records regarding these same permitting issues; records that had been in existence years\n\nbefore the trial. The Moores do not describe any prior efforts to acquire these public records\n\nbefore the trial, nor do they allege a lack of knowledge as to these records' existence. It is not an\n\nabuse of discretion for a trial court to refuse to reopen a case to allow a party to belatedly submit\n\nevidence they could have, but failed to produce at trial. The trial court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in refusing to reopen the case after appeal.\n\n                           II. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE To SUPPORT FINDINGS\n\n        The Moores argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court' s findings of\n\nfact regarding SOS' s impacts on their property. Specifically, the Moores argue that substantial\n\n evidence does not support the trial court' s findings regarding noise, smoke, fumes, and traffic\n\n impacts. We disagree.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    10\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n          Where the trial court considers evidence in a bench trial, we review the findings of fact\n\nfor   substantial evidence.         Saviano     v.   Westport Amusements, Inc.,            144 Wn. App. 72, 78, 180 P. 3d\n\n874 ( 2008).      Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to persuade a fair -\n                                                                                 minded person that the\n\n\nfinding is true. Saviano, 144 Wn. App. at 78. The challenging party bears the burden of\n\nshowing that the record does not support the challenged findings. Saviano, 144 Wn. App. at 78.\n\nWe review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and we defer to the\n                                                                                            7\ntrial   court   regarding     witness    credibility    and   conflicting testimony.            City of University Place v.\n\nMcGuire, 144 Wn.2d 640, 652, 30 P. 3d 453 ( 2001).\n\n\n          We hold that substantial evidence supports the findings of fact regarding SOS' s\n\nproduction of noise, fumes, and traffic congestion.\n\n\nA.        Findings Regarding Noise\n\n           The Moores argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court' s findings\n\n\nregarding the impact          of   SOS'   s noise on     their property: (      1) the outboard motor noise from SOS\n\n\nwas not    deafening,     even      up   close; (   2) Krueger characterized the noise' s frequency as periodic,\n\nand that Krueger heard SOS' s noise only when she was outside her home, when she got her mail,\n\nand when she worked             in her flower        gardens; (   3) Moore' s testimony regarding the frequency and\n\nvolume of       the   noise   lacked credibility; ( 4)      none of the Moores' neighbors, particularly David,\n\nJacobs,    and    Gordon, had any         problems with        SOS'      s noise; (   5) the beeping of SOS' s tractor had\n\nnot occurred       in the last     couple of years; (     6) the motors on boats and jet skis and leaf blowers\n\n\nmade noise in the same region as. SOS; and ( 7) the motor vehicle traffic on SR 106, including\n\n\n7\n    The Moores argue that the trial court misapplied the preponderance of the evidence standard,\nsuggesting that we should review the findings under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\nBut we review findings of fact for substantial evidence. Saviano, 144 Wn. App. at78.\n\n\n                                                                    11\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nmotorcycles, produced the most significant noise source in the area. We hold that substantial\n\nevidence supports all of these factual findings.\n\n\n         Two customers testified to their ability to talk to Steven in his shop with the motors\n\nrunning. Krueger'       s own   testimony   supported       that   she   heard the   noise \"   periodically,\"   as well as\n\n\n\nthe   specific places   that she heard the   noise.    1 VRP at 16. David, Jacobs, and Gordon all testified\n\n\nthat the noise did not bother them at all. Krueger admitted that SOS had not used the tractor\n\nbeeper for years, and that she regularly used a leaf blower that made noise. Krueger' s use of the\n\nleaf blower was confirmed by two neighbors' testimonies. Four witnesses' testimonies all\n\nconfirmed that SR 106 noise was significantly louder than noise produced by SOS.\n\n          The Moores argue that the Loves' witnesses lived farther away from SOS than the\n\nMoores, or lived there less frequently than the Kruegers,. such that the Loves' witnesses did not\n\nprovide substantial evidence to support the trial court' s findings regarding noise. The Moores\n\nalso attack the trial court' s determination that Krueger' s testimony regarding the noise' s duration\n\nand volume lacked credibility. The Moores' argument is actually a request for us to reweigh the\n\nevidence, couched in terms of a substantial evidence argument. We do not reweigh evidence, but\n\ndefer to the trial court regarding witness credibility. City of University Place, 144 Wn.2d at 652.\n                                                                                                8\nSubstantial   evidence supports      the trial   court' s   findings relating to       noise.\n\n\n\n\n8\n    The Moores argue that the trial court erred by focusing on the duration of the use of SR 106,\ninstead of focusing on its repetitiveness, when determining nuisance in fact. The Moores do not\nsupport this proposition with any legal authority, and thus we do not consider it. See Escude v.\nKing County Public Hosp. Dist. No. 2, 117 Wn. App. 183, 190 n.4, 69 P. 3d 895 ( 2003).\n\n                                                              12\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nB.       Findings Regarding Smoke and Fumes\n\n         The Moores also argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court' s\n\nfindings regarding the   smoke and   fumes   produced     by   SOS: (    1) while SOS' s running of motors\n\nproduced some smoke, SOS ran motors for only 15 minutes per day, and was a clean and\n\nenvironmentally    conscious   company; ( 2) the smoke and fumes did not bother the other adjacent\n\n\nneighbors, including David, Jacobs, and Gordon; and ( 3) the area had other sources of smoke at\n\ntimes.   Substantial evidence supports all of these factual findings.\n\n\n         A great deal of testimony supports the trial court' s findings regarding the smoke and\n\nfumes SOS produced. David, Jacobs, and Gordon all testified that the smoke did not bother\n\nthem, and /or that they had never even noticed it. Krueger testified that the motors ran \"just\n\nperiodically.\"   1 VRP at 16. David testified that he heard the motors for only minutes a day.\n\nJacobs testified that he heard   engines   revving up \"   once   in   a while.\"   1 VRP   at   142. Steven\n\n\ntestified that in an entire day he typically ran motors for 15 minutes at the most, 95 per cent of\n\nwhich was on idle. He also testified that he generally ran motors on open throttle for no more\n\nthan 30 seconds. Testimony clearly established that the busy SR 106 was nearby, producing\npotential alternative sources of smoke. Steven testified that he and the Kruegers had wood\n\nstoves which caused a great deal of smoke at times.\n\n\n         It is true that Moore testified that smoke and fumes occasionally presented a problem on\n\nher property, and that Krueger testified that smoke and fumes from SOS reached her property. It\n\nis also true that the Moores submitted photographs showing several plumes or hazes of smoke,\n\npurportedly from SOS. Thus the testimony conflicted, and the trial court resolved the conflict in\n\n\n\n\n                                                     13\n\fNo. 41557 - -II\n          7\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nfavor of the Loves. We defer to that decision. City of University Place, 144 Wn.2d at 652.\n\nSubstantial evidence supported the trial court' s findings regarding smoke and fumes.\n\nC.       Findings Regarding Traffic Impacts\n\n         The Moores further argue that substantial evidence failed to support the trial court' s\n\nfindings regarding SOS'            s effect on   traffic   on   SR 106: ( 1) that no accidents had occurred on SR\n\n\n106 for the     previous   20   years; (   2) that SOS'     s operation was       low   volume; ( 3)   that SOS' s operation\n\n\n                                                                 did         deviate from SR 106'          typical              4)\nonly had brief use           the              that this\n                        of         road and                use         not                             s             usage; (\n\n\n\n\nthat SOS' s use of SR 106 obstructed neither traffic, nor anyone else' s use of SR 106. We hold\n\nthat substantial evidence supports all of these factual findings.\n\n         Krueger testified that no serious accident had occurred on SR 106. Krueger, two\n\nneighbors, and a customer all testified that SR 106 had a great deal of traffic other than that\n\nproduced    by   SOS.    Gordon testified that no one, including SOS, had caused traffic congestion\n\nproblems, and        that \" everybody      parks   boats    on   the         of-way.\"\n                                                                       right -            1 VRP at 177. Two customers\n\n\ntestified that SR 106 regularly had numerous boats, delivery trucks, and other vehicles parked on\n\nthe shoulder.\n\n\n\n          Steven testified that he stored boats on his property behind his shop or in his carports,\n\nrather   than   on   SR 106.       Gordon testified that he knew of no traffic safety problems caused by\n\nSOS, and that Steven took safety precautions when moving boats. Many of SOS' s customers\n\nconfirmed that Steven was highly safety conscious, testifying that SOS never caused traffic\n\nproblems, and had procedures to quickly move boats off of SR 106 so as to ensure that SOS was\n\nnever overwhelmed with boats.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  14\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n         Both Krueger and Moore testified that SOS' s customers and delivery trucks used the SR\n\n106         of -\n      right -  way,     potentially      impeding    traffic   and    causing safety   concerns.   However, the trial\n\n\ncourt resolved this conflict in favor of the Loves and we defer to that decision. City of University\n\nPlace, 144 Wn.2d        at   652.   Substantial evidence supports the trial court' s findings regarding\n\nSOS' s traffic impacts.\n\n\n                                                   III. NUISANCE IN FACT\n\n\n          The Moores next argue that the trial court' s factual findings fail to support the conclusion\n\nthat.SOS was not a nuisance in fact. We disagree.\n\n\n          We review the trial court' s conclusions of law de novo to see if the findings of fact\n\nsupport   them. Bingham' v. Lechner, 111 Wn.                   App.    118, 127, 45 P. 3d 562 ( 2002). When the trial\n\n\ncourt' s findings are susceptible of two constructions, one that supports the conclusions of law\n\nand one that   does     not, \"   the findings of fact must be construed in a manner which will support the\n\n\ntrial court' s conclusions of       law.\" Lincoln Shiloh Assoc., Ltd. v. Mukilteo Water Dist., 45 Wn.\n\n\nApp. 123, 131, 724 P. 2d 1083 ( 1986).\n\nRCW 7. 48. 120 defines nuisance in Washington, and provides:\n\n\n          Nuisance consists in unlawfully doing an act, or omitting to perform a duty,\n          which act or omission either annoys, injures or endangers the comfort, repose,\n          health   or    safety     of   others,decency, or unlawfully interferes with,\n                                                    offends\n\n          obstructs or tends to obstruct, or render dangerous for passage, any lake or\n          navigable river, bay, stream, canal or basin, or any public park, square, street or\n          highway; or in any way renders other persons insecure in life, or in the use of\n          property.\n\n\n          A nuisance in fact exists if one owner' s use of land unreasonably interferes with\n\nanother' s use and enjoyment of the other' s own land. Tiegs v. Watts, 135 Wn.2d 1, 13, 954 P. 2d\n\n877 ( 1998).    A trial court determines reasonableness by balancing the rights, interests, and\n\n\n\n                                                                 15\n\fNo. 41 557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nconvenience of      the   parties.   Jones   v.   Rumford, 64 Wn.2d 559, 563, 392 P. 2d 808 ( 1964).   Such\n\n\nbalancing requires consideration of the social utility of the defendant' s conduct, the gravity of\n\nthe harm to the plaintiff, and the character of the neighborhood in which the activity is located.\n\nHighline School Dist. No. 401 v. Port ofSeattle, 87 Wn.2d 6, 17 -18 n.7, 548 P. 2d 1085 ( 1976).\n\nThis is an objective analysis based on the standards of a \" person of ordinary and normal\n\nsensibilities. \".   Riblet v. Ideal Cement Co., 57 Wn.2d 619, 622, 358 P. 2d 975 ( 1961).\n\n        Here, the trial court concluded that, on balance, SOS' s operations did not create an\n\nunreasonable interference with the Moores' use and enjoyment of their land. It is clear from the\n\nfindings that the trial court reached this conclusion after balancing the parties' rights, interests,\n\nand conveniences. In addition, the trial court also found that the Moores' land suffered no injury\n\nor loss of value.\n\n\n         The trial court supported its conclusion that the noise did not constitute an unreasonable\n\n\ninterference by finding that the noise SOS produced was limited in duration and volume,\n\ncomparable to that of the Kruegers' own leaf blower, and less than the SR 106 noise. The trial\n\ncourt also found that much of Moore' s testimony as to the noise lacked credibility.\n\n         The trial court supported its conclusion that SOS' s smoke production was not\n\n\nunreasonable by finding that SOS' s shop was clean, Steven had not intentionally produced\n\nsignificant smoke in conducting SOS' s operations since 2000, and other sources of smoke\n\nexisted in the area. The trial court supported its conclusion that SOS' s impact on traffic was not\n\nunreasonable by finding that Steven placed great importance on traffic safety, took work only by\n\nappointment, and blocked SR 106 for a very limited amount of time, not inconsistent with\n\n\n\n\n                                                             16\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n                                9\nregular usage of      SR 106.       Finally, the trial court supported its legal conclusion that no aspect of\n\nSOS' s operation constituted an unreasonable interference with the Moores' land on balance by\n\nfinding that SOS' s operations bothered none of the neighbors besides the Moores.\n\n        The Moores cite Davis v. Taylor, 132 Wn. App. 515, 132 P. 3d 783 ( 2006) for the\n\nproposition that courts are obligated to consider the impact on the complaining party' s property.\n\nBut Davis addressed whether a farm was protected under right - -farm laws and did not\n                                                             to\n\nannounce     the   rule   the Moores    claim.   132 Wn. App. at 519 -23..\n\n        The Moores also cite Riblet v. Spokane -Portland Cement Co., 45 Wn.2d 346, 274 P. 2d\n\n574 ( 1954) for the principle that the trial court must base its nuisance in fact conclusion upon the\n\n\nimpacts to a particular plaintiff' s property, without considering whether the alleged nuisance\n\nbothers others in the community. This argument inaccurately interprets Riblet. Riblet held that\n\nthe trial court should consider intangible harms in addition to tangible harms, but never\n\nsuggested that the trial court should measure losses subjectively based on a plaintiff' s unique\n\nsensibilities. See 45 Wn.2d at 354 -55.\n\n\n        The Moores also cite Payne v. Johnson, 20 Wn.2d 24, 145 P. 2d 552 ( 1944) for the\n\n\nproposition that the trial court must judge a nuisance in fact solely on the impacts to a plaintiff' s\n\nproperty   without        considering   whether such   impacts   are unreasonable.   But Payne held, \" Whether\n\n\n\n\n9 The Moores cite Park v. Stolzheise, 24 Wn.2d 781, 167 P. 2d 412 ( 1946) for the proposition that\nso long as the Moores showed subjective fear due to traffic safety concerns, they have\ndemonstrated a nuisance in fact. But Park dealt with the fear of an entire 1940' s residential\ncommunity regarding the potential opening of a mental institution within that community. 24\nWn.2d   at   797 -98.      The Court held that where an entire residential community shared a strong\ncommon fear of a proposed land use, the community' s fear was per se reasonable, regardless of\nwhether science justified the fear. 24 Wn.2d at 797 -98, 800. Thus, Park is distinguishable.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           17\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nappellant' s particular use of his property constitutes a nuisance presents the question whether the\n\nuse   to   which    the property   is   put   is   reasonable or unreasonable.\"       20 Wn.2d at 29.\n\n\n            We hold that the findings of fact support the trial court' s conclusion that the Moores did\n\n\nnot establish that SOS was a nuisance in fact.\n\n\n                                                      IV. NUISANCE PER SE\n\n\n            The Moores argue that the trial court erred in ( 1) concluding that LUPA' s 21 day statute\n\nof limitations barred the Moores' nuisance per se claim and ( 2) concluding that the Moores'\n                                                                                                               10\nclaim      for   nuisance per se   fails   even     if SOS   operated   in   violation of   law. We   agree.\n\n\n\n\n            A.        Improper Application ofLUPA\n\n            The Moores argue that the trial court erred in ruling that because the nuisance per se\n\nclaim would require the trial court to overturn a county determination that SOS could-operate,\n\nLUPA' s 21 day statute of limitations bars the Moores' nuisance per se claim. We agree with the\n\nMoores.\n\n\n            We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. Manna Funding, LLC v. Kittitas\n\nCounty,      173 Wn.

Toandos Peninsula Assn v. Jefferson\nCounty,      32 Wn.    App.        473, 485, 648 P. 2d 448 ( 1982).           Here Mason County allowed SOS to\noperate without a permit as a \" cottage                 industry.\"      Ex. 7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     19\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nproduced an order declaring improper a Mason County interpretive decision relating to the\n\nLoves' use of their land.\n\n\n       The trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that LUPA precludes the Moores' claims\n\nfor three reasons. First, the Case Activity Listing was the result of a low -\n                                                                            level case study\n\nsummarily dismissing a complaint. This does not constitute a land use decision as defined by\n\nLUPA, because Mason County was not determining whether SOS could legally continue to\n\noperate on the Loves' property without further permits. Rather, it was summarily dismissing a\n\ncomplaint for lack of evidence.\n\n\n        Second, even if we assume that the Mason County Case Activity Listing constituted a\n\nfinal land use decision regarding whether SOS is a cottage industry, this decision did not impact\n\nthe Moores'    claim —  whether SOS is operating without a shoreline conditional use permit.\n\nMason County requires cottage industries to obtain conditional use permits, and thus whether\n\nSOS is a \" cottage industry\" does, not resolve the legality of the Loves' commercial use of their\n                                                     14\nproperty for SOS. MCC 17. 03. 021; 17. 50. 040.           Third, the Moores raised additional arguments\n\n\nas to why SOS' s operations constitute nuisance per se that do not involve any permitting\n\ndecision. For example, the Moores argue that SOS violated the Mason County noise ordinance,\n\nchapter 9. 36 MCC, and violated the WSDOT' s regulations. Mason County' s Case Activity\n\n\n\n\n14 Mason County Code' s Shoreline Management Master Program states in the definitions section\nthat cottage industries must obtain a conditional use permit. MCC 17. 50. 040. The broader\ndevelopment rules section of the Mason County Code requires a cottage industry to obtain a\nconditional use permit unless it can meet seven requirements, including that the cottage industry\nuses \"[ n] o equipment or process . . .   which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or\nelectrical   interference detectable to the   normal senses   off the property.\" MCC 17. 03. 021( 6)\n emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                     20\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nListing did not discuss, and, thus cannot constitute a land use decision on, these issues. Thus, the\n\ntrial court erred in asserting that LUPA bars the Moores' nuisance per se claim.\n\n       B.         Improper Reasonableness Balancing\n\n       The Moores argue that the trial court erred in ruling that because SOS' s interference with\n\nthe Moores' land was not unreasonable, their nuisance per se claim must fail. We agree with the\n\n           15\nMoores.\n\n\n        We review interpretations of law de novo. Freedom Foundation v. Wash. State Dept. of\n\nTransp.,   Div. of Wash. State Ferries, 168 Wn.      App.     278, 286, 276 P. 3d 341 ( 2012). Whereas\n\n\nnuisance in fact requires the trial court to balance the parties'- interests to determine the\n\nreasonableness of the defendants' conduct, a claim for nuisance per se does not require such\n\n\nbalancing. \" When the conditions giving rise to a nuisance are also a violation of statutory\n\nprohibition, those conditions constitute a nuisance per se, and the issue of the reasonableness of\n\nthe defendant' s conduct and the weighing of the relative interests of the plaintiff and defendant is\n\nprecluded because the Legislature has, in effect, already struck the balance in favor of the\n\ninnocent party.\" Tiegs      v.   Boise Cascade   Corp., 83 Wn. App. 411, 418, 922 P. 2d 115 ( 1996)\n\n quoting Branch v. W. Petroleum, Inc., 657 P. 2d 267, 276 ( Utah 1982)).\n\n        This gives nuisance per se the character of strict liability. Tiegs, 83 Wn. App. at 418.\n\nHowever, the unlawful conduct must still interfere with a plaintiff' s use and enjoyment of his or\n\nher land in     some   way for   a nuisance per se claim   to lie.   Tiegs, 83 Wn. App. at 418; see also\n\n\nis The Moores also argue that the trial court erred in interpreting the SMA to abolish a common\nlaw right of nuisance. However, the trial court did not interpret the statute in such a way. The\ntrial court said that the Moores' nuisance per se claim fails because SOS' s interference with their\nland is not, on balance, unreasonable. The trial court then added as an unrelated aside that the\nMoores could have received a damages remedy under the SMA if they had proven any damages.\n\n                                                       21\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nMotor Car Dealers Assoc. of Seattle           v.   Fred S. Haines Co., 128 Wash. 267, 273 -74, 222 P. 611\n\n\n 1924) ( business competitor of car dealer could not establish nuisance per se where the defendant\n\n\noperated on Sunday in violation of law, because not a nuisance at all times, and because no\n\nnegative    impacts to the   plaintiff' s use of   property    whatsoever).    However, establishing any\n\ninterference of a plaintiff' s use and enjoyment of property caused by acts violating a law satisfies\n\nnuisance per se, regardless of      the interference'      s reasonableness.    Tiegs, 83 Wn. App. at 418.\n\n         The trial court stated in its findings that SOS, on balance, did not have an unreasonable\n\nimpact on the Moores' use and enjoyment of their land. However, it also found that SOS\n\nimpacted the Moores' land. Thus the trial court found that SOS interfered with the Moores' use\n\nand enjoyment of their land to some degree, just not an unreasonable degree.\n\n         But after ruling that SOS' s business had some impact on the Moores' use and enjoyment\n\nof their land, the trial court ruled that the Moores' nuisance per se claim failed, and that\n\n\n  w]hether or not Mr. Love is operating in violation of the SMA, other Mason County or\n\nWashington State     regulations or permits would not change              the result.\"   CP at 242. This is\n\n\nbecause the trial court determined that nuisance per se requires establishing that the violations\n\nlead to a use of land which \" injures the plaintiffs' properties or unreasonably interferes with\n\ntheir   enjoyment of   their   properties.\"   CP    at   242 ( emphasis   added).   For this reason, the trial court\n\n\nrejected the Moores' claim, stating that the Loves' use of their property for SOS was \" not, on\n\nbalance, found to be unreasonable considering the rights, interests and conveniences of the\n\nparties.\"    CP at 242.\n\n\n          In finding that the Moores' nuisance per se claim failed, the trial court misinterpreted the\n\nlaw, by applying a reasonableness balancing test to a nuisance per se claim. This is in direct\n\n\n                                                             22\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nconflict with the law and, thus, constituted reversible error. We hold that the trial court erred in\n\n\nconducting reasonableness balancing when analyzing the Moores' nuisance per se claim.\n\nC.       New Trial on Nuisance Per Se\n\n\n         We remand on the limited issue of nuisance per se. RAP 12. 2 allows us to \" take any\n\nother action as the merits of the case and the interest ofjustice may require\" when deciding a\n\ncase. An appellate court may affirm some issues, while remanding others. See In re Yakima\n\nRiver Drainage Basin, 177 Wn.2d 299, 350, 296 P. 3d 835 ( 2013).                  This can serve as an effective\n\n\nway to   bring   a   long   and complex   land   use adjudication \" one   step   closer   to   finality.\"   See Yakima\n\n\nRiver Drainage Basin, 177 Wn.2d at 350.\n\n\n         Thus we hold that the trial court committed a reversible error of law, and that we may, in\n\ninstructing the trial court, take any action as the interests of justice require. RAP 12. 2. In this\n\ncase, because the trial court erroneously interpreted the law, the trial court never reached the\n\nquestion of whether SOS had proper permitting. For this reason, justice would be served if we\n\nremanded this case for a new trial on nuisance per se, to allow the trial court to fully address and\n\ndetermine SOS' s permitting status, and to determine whether that permitting status violated the\n\nlaw. Thus we remand for trial on the issue of nuisance per se.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          23\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -I1\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n        We remand the issue to the trial court for a new trial where both sides may produce\n\nevidence of SOS' s permitting status, which the trial court can use in making a new determination\n                                                                           16\nbased   upon   the   correct   legal   standard   for   nuisance per se.\n\n\n\n\n                                           V. ATTORNEY FEES AT TRIAL\n\n\n         Finally, the Moores argue that the trial court erred in granting the Loves attorney fees,\n\narguing a number of theories. We hold that ( 1) the Loves are entitled to attorney fees under\n\nRCW 90. 58. 230 because they            prevailed on      the Shoreline Management Act   claim, ( 2)   the trial\n\n\ncourt did not need to make a finding of bad faith to award attorney fees under the SMA, but (3)\n\nthe trial court impermissibly failed to segregate the fees. We reverse the attorney fee award,\n\nbecause the trial court improperly segregated the fees of the Loves' trial counsel Finlay, and then\n\nremand for a recalculation of fees consistent with our opinion.\n\n\nA.       Applicability of the SAM s Attorney Fee Provision\n\n         The Moores argue that the trial court had no lawful basis for awarding attorney fees\n\nunder the SMA' s attorney fee provision. RCW 90. 58. 230. The Moores contend that the SMA\n\ndid not make attorney fees available because the Moores did not make a claim under the SMA.\n\n\n16 The Loves argue that this court should dismiss the Moores' nuisance per se claim because the\nMoores failed to prove whether or not SOS had proper permits, citing Gill v. LDI, 19 F. Supp. 2d\n1188 ( W.D. Wash. 1998) as persuasive authority. However, in Gill the federal court held in\ndefendant' s favor on a dispute offact (regarding whether or not defendant was in compliance\nwith a permit), because plaintiff was the moving party on summary judgment. 19 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n 1191 -92, 1199 -1200.\n\n\n        Unlike Gill, which dealt with factual disputes on summary judgment, this case concerns a\ntrial court' s erroneous legal conclusion regarding nuisance per se following a bench trial. We\nreview this erroneous conclusion of law de novo. Because the trial court' s erroneous conclusion\nof law led it to refrain from making a factual finding as to whether or not SOS had proper\npermitting, remand is the appropriate remedy so as to resolve the factual dispute.\n\n\n                                                               Im\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 - II\n\n\nThe Moores argue that they abandoned all damages claims during trial, meaning that they could\n\nnot have possibly had a claim under the SMA, given that the SMA limits private parties' relief to\n\ndamages. Thus the Moores argue that the Loves did not \" prevail\" on an SMA claim, and cannot\n\ncollect   attorney fees      under   the SMA.    See Br.   of   Appellants      at   45.   We disagree.\n\n\n          Whether a legal basis to award attorney fees exists is a legal issue reviewed de novo.\n\nUnifund CCR Partners           v.   Sunde, 163 Wn.      App.    473, 484, 260 P. 3d 915 ( 2011).           RCW\n\n\n90. 58. 230, part of the SMA, provides:\n\n\n          Private persons shall have the right to bring suit for damages under this section on\n          their   own   behalf      and on   the behalf   of all persons       similarly    situated. . . . [   t] he\n\n          court in its discretion may award attorney' s fees and costs of the suit to the\n          prevailing party.\n\n\n          Private citizens may sue for damages under the SMA, but may not sue for\n          injunctive    or   declaratory     relief.   Hedlund v. White, 67 Wn. App. 409, 414, 836\n          P. 2d 250 ( 1992).\n\n\n          In this case, the Moores explicitly pleaded a claim for damages under the SMA in their\n\ncomplaint.        At closing   argument,     the Moores    stated, \"   While the plaintiffs are not necessarily\n\nseeking damages, damages are allowed both under the nuisance statute and state ` Shoreline\n\nManagement Act'         and should      be   considered   by   the   court.\"    CP at 160.\n\n\n          The Moores argue that when making the determination of whether the Moores made a\n\nclaim for damages, the trial court should have limited itself to considering only admitted\n\nevidence. Thus, the Moores argue that the trial court should have disregarded the Moores'\n\n\nclosing argument (because closing arguments are not evidence) and should have instead focused\n\non the testimonies of Moore and Krueger, both of whom testified that they wanted only to\n\nprevent SOS from operating.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                25\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n         However, the Moores cite no authority suggesting that a trial court may consider admitted\n\nevidence only when determining whether a party made a claim. Nor do they cite any authority\n\nthat a party may abandon a claim via witness testimony, or that such an abandonment would be\n\neffective in the face of a subsequent request at closing argument that the trial court considers the\n\nclaim. We hold that the record reflects no abandonment of the SMA claim and that the SMA\n\n\nauthorizes attorney fees in this case.\n\nB.       RCW 90.58.230' s Attorney Fee Provision\n\n         The Moores argue that the trial court violated RCW 90. 58. 230, because it allows the trial\n\n\ncourt to impose attorney fee awards only against a party who has litigated in bad faith. The\n\nLoves argue that the statute allows the trial court discretionary imposition of attorney fees\n\nagainst parties,   irrespective      of   bad faith. II Br.   of   Respondents      at   13.   We agree with the\n\n         17\nLoves.\n\n\n         We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo. Manna Funding, LLC, 173 Wn.\n\nApp. at 890. RCW 90. 58. 230 states that the trial court \" in its discretion may award attorney' s\n\nfees   and costs of   the   suit   to the prevailing party.\"       The trial court may award attorney fees to\n\neither the plaintiff or the defendant. Cowiche Canyon Conservancy v. Bosley, 118 Wn.2d 801,\n\n823, 828 P. 2d 549 ( 1992).\n\n\n\n\n17 The Moores also argue that the trial court abused its discretion by granting attorney fees\nbecause the fee award was \" an undue deterrent, punishing Appellants' use of the courts to raise\nlegitimate    concerns when government             defaults   on    its   responsibilities.\"    Br. of Appellant at 46 -47.\nBut the Moores cite no law to support this argument in their original briefs, and did not add any\nsupport in their supplemental briefs. Thus we do not consider it. See Escude, 117 Wn. App. at\n 190 n.4.\n\n\n\n                                                              Rol\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n          The Moores cite two cases for the proposition that RCW 90. 58. 230 limits the trial court\n\n\nto awarding fees against parties who have engaged in malicious conduct or made frivolous\n\nclaims.    Cowiche Canyon Conservancy, 118 Wn.2d at 823 -24; Hunt v. Anderson, 30 Wn. App.\n\n437, 443, 635 P. 2d 156 ( 1981).       However, both cases affirm the discretionary rulings by a trial\n\ncourt on attorney fees, and support the proposition that the trial court has discretion on whether\n\nto impose fees, overturned only for abuse of discretion. Cowiche Canyon Conservancy, 118\n\nWn.2d     at   825; Hunt, 30 Wn.   App.     at   443. Thus we hold that RCW 90. 58. 230 does not require\n\n\nthe trial court to make a finding of bad faith prior to awarding attorney fees in its discretion.\n\nC.        Segregation ofFees\n\n          The Moores further argue that the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees to Finlay,\n\nincurred defending the Loves in district court in a criminal case. We agree.\n\n          The trial court' s attorney fee award will not be overturned absent a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Fisher Props., Inc.       v.         Mayfair, Inc., 115 Wn.2d 364, 375, 798 P. 2d 799\n                                           Arden -\n\n\n 1990).    A trial court abuses its discretion if its decision is manifestly unreasonable or based on\n\nuntenable grounds.      Mayer   v.   Sto Indus., Inc., 156 Wn.2d 677, 684, 132 P. 3d 115 ( 2006).\n\n\n          A trial court must ordinarily segregate claims for which attorney fees are available from\n\nthose for which fees are not available. Dice v. City ofMontesano, 131 Wn. App. 675, 690, 128\n\nP. 3d 1253 ( 2006).    However, a trial court need not segregate fees for claims that it finds so\n\nrelated that segregation is not reasonable. Dice, 131 Wn. App. at 690. A trial court need not\n\nsegregate fees where the claims all relate to the same fact pattern, but provide different bases for\n\nrecovery. Manna Funding, LLC, 173 Wn. App. at 901.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           27\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 - II\n\n\n          Of the trial   court' s   attorney fee   award of $28,   907. 44 to the Loves, $ 16, 812. 50 went to\n\n          l8\nFinlay.        This $ 16, 812. 50   included fees that Finlay accrued by defending the Loves in a district\n\ncourt criminal case regarding their dock and jet ski float. The Moores had complained about the\n\ndock and jet ski float on June 5, 2007, almost one year after filing their lawsuit against the Loves\n\non June 23, 2006. Finlay stated by declaration that he charged $2, 000 for this district court\n\ncriminal case. Finlay stated not only that the Kruegers instigated the district court criminal case\n\nthrough their complaint, but also that he used the legal research from the district court case to\n\ndefend the Loves against the Moores' civil suit.\n\n\n          The trial court concluded that the time Finlay spent on the district court criminal case was\n\ntoo integrated with the litigation against the Moores for separation. The trial court did this\n\nbecause Finlay used much of the research done in defending the criminal complaint in the case\n\nagainst the Moores, and because the compliant occurred after the litigation with the Moores\n\nbegan.\n\n\n           It is well settled that courts may decline to segregate fees for unsuccessful claims when\n\nsuch claims are too intertwined to reasonably separate. Dice, 131 Wn. App. at 690. However,\n\nno authority states that courts may combine the fees for separate cases in separate courts on this\n\nbasis.\n\n\n\n\n 18\n      When the trial court reduced the attorney fee award from $36, 034. 69 to $28, 907.44, it took the\n difference out of Eisenhower and Carlson, PLLC' s fees, and did not reduce the amount awarded\nto Finlay. In its amendment to the attorney fee award, the trial court maintained that it had no\n obligation to segregate the fees Finlay incurred. The trial court ruled that it need not segregate\n attorney fees where the claims are too integrated to properly segregate them.\n\n\n                                                             3\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 - II\n\n\n         Although the district court case may have concerned the same legal issues as the Moores'\n\nnuisance suit and shared background research, this is not sufficient to justify merging a criminal\n\ncase in district court with a civil case in superior court. Moreover, Finlay himself segregated the\n\nbilling for the district court case. Finlay stated by declaration that he billed the Loves a $2,000\n\nflat fee for the district court case, while he billed a $ 5, 000 flat fee for the Moores' civil suit.\n\nFurthermore, one case focused on the Loves' dock and jet ski float, whereas the other case\n\nfocused    on   the   operation of   SOS.   Thus, not only could the trial court have segregated the cases,\n\nthe Loves' attorney Finlay had already segregated them. The trial court abused its discretion by\n\ngranting the Loves attorney fees for the district court case. We reverse the award of attorney fees\n\nfor the district court case.\n\n\n                                        ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n\n\n          The Loves request attorney fees on appeal under the SMA' s RCW 90. 58. 230. See RAP\n\n18. 1.   The Loves argue that RCW 90. 58. 230 authorizes such fees. However, the Loves do not\n\nprevail on appeal based on any violation of the SMA, because the Moores did not appeal the\n\nSMA issue. Thus the Loves are not entitled to attorney fees on appeal under RCW 90. 58. 230.\n\nSee Juanita Bay Valley Cmty. Assn v. City ofKirkland, 9 Wn.

J. —                In this consolidated appeal, Hal and Melanie Moore and Lester and\n\nBetty Krueger ( collectively, the Moores) appeal two trial court orders that ( 1) dismissed their\nclaims against         Steven        and   Mary   Lou Love   and   Steve'   s   Outboard Service ( SOS), ( 2) awarded\n\n\nattorney fees to the Loves, and ( 3) refused to consider additional evidence after we remanded the\n\nMoores' first appeal to the trial court to enter more complete findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. The Moores had sued SOS and the Loves, asserting claims of nuisance in fact, nuisance per\n\nse, and violations of            the Shoreline Management Act (SMA). 1                 The Moores now argue that the\n\ntrial   court erred        by ( 1)   refusing to    consider additional evidence after remand, (       2) entering\n\nfindings       of   fact   unsupported      by    substantial evidence, (       3) concluding that the Moores showed no\n\nnuisance in fact, (4) concluding that the Moores showed no nuisance per se, and ( 5) granting\n\n1\n    Chapter 90. 58 RCW.\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nattorney fees. We reverse the trial court' s dismissal of the Moores' nuisance per se claim and its\n\nattorney fee award and remand for further proceedings. We affirm the trial court' s dismissal of\nthe Moores' other claims.\n\n\n                                                       FACTS\n\n\n         Steve' s Outboard Service ( SOS) is an outboard motor repair sole proprietorship that\n\n\nSteven Love and Mary Lou Love have owned since 1994, and that Steven has operated from\n\ntheir home along State Route ( SR) 106, on the south shore of Hood Canal in Mason County. In\n\n2006, the Moores sued SOS and the Loves, alleging that SOS' s operations constituted a nuisance\n\nand a violation of the Shoreline Management Act.3\n\nA.       The Moores' Case at Trial\n\n\n         The Moores presented two witnesses during this bench trial: Betty Krueger and Melanie\n\nMoore.\n\n\n          1.   Betty Krueger\n\n         Krueger testified that SOS affected her by generating smoke, fumes, and noise from\n\n           engines.     Krueger testified that     smoke and   fumes from SOS     reached   her property. She\nrevving\n\n\nalso testified that SOS caused traffic safety hazards because customers and delivery vehicles\n\nused the SR 106 right -of way, although she admitted that no serious accidents had occurred on\n                          -\n\n\n2\n    For purposes of clarity, we refer to Hal and Melanie Moore and Lester and Betty Krueger\n                as \"   the Moores.\"   We   refer   to Steven Love   and   Mary   Lou Love   as \"   the Loves.\" We\ncollectively\nrefer to individuals by their first names when referring to them individually. We intend no\n disrespect.\n\n\n 3 The Moores also sued Mason County for failure to enforce the SMA against SOS. But the trial\n court dismissed the Moores' claim against Mason County on summary judgment. The Moores\n assign no error to this dismissal.\n\n\n                                                          PA\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\nSR 106. Krueger testified that SOS made periodic noise when revving boat engines, and\n\noperating a tractor with a beeping device to bring boats onto the Loves' property. Krueger also\n\ntestified that she no longer used a patio on the side of her house that faced SR 106 because of the\n\nnoise SOS generated. Krueger admitted that her caretaker frequently used a gas powered leaf\n\nblower and pressure washer that made noise. Krueger testified that SOS' s customers and\n\n\ndelivery trucks used the SR 106 right -of way, potentially impeding traffic and causing safety\n                                          -\n\nconcerns.\n\n\n\n\n          The Moores submitted photographs showing several plumes or hazes of smoke,\n\npurportedly from SOS. Krueger testified that she saw such smoke in the spring, summer, and\n\nfall,   and   that she periodically smelled   exhaust   fumes from the   smoke.   She further testified that\n\n\nshe was not seeking damages, but only wanted SOS' s operation stopped.\n\n          2. Melanie Moore\n\n\n              Melanie Moore owned a home on SR 106, across the street from the Loves' property,\n\nwhere she lived during the summer. Although Moore provided testimony regarding the\n\nfrequency and volume of the noise that SOS produced; the trial court found that this testimony\n\nwas not credible, and we defer to that determination of credibility.\n\n          Moore testified that although she-had heard the beeping of SOS' s tractor, Steven had\n\nsince disengaged the beeper. Moore testified that on windless summer days she could see smoke\n\nand smell fumes SOS generated. Moore testified that smoke and fumes occasionally presented a\n\nproblem on       her property.\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -I1           1\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -11\n\n\n        Moore testified to many concerns she had regarding SOS' s use of SR 106 and this\n\nroadside. And she testified that she wanted only to prevent SOS from operating out of the\n\nLoves' property.\n\n        3.   Evidence Regarding Permitting\n\n        Because the Moores claimed nuisance per se, they submitted documentary evidence\n\nregarding various permits that Steven may or may not have obtained. This included a shoreline\n\npermit application that Steven filed in 1994 to build a 30 -by 45 -foot metal building on his\n\nproperty, a letter from Steven withdrawing this application, and a letter from Mason County\n\nacknowledging Steven' s withdrawal letter. The Moores also submitted building permit\n\napplications filed in 1994 that requested permits to replace a carport and to remodel a storage\n\n\nshed.\n\n\n\n\n        The Moores      submitted a report   from Mason   County   entitled \"   Case   Activity Listing.\"   Ex.\n\n\n7. The Case Activity Listing listed the permits that Mason County employees believed the\n\ncounty had granted to Steven over the years, and briefly described those permits. This Case\n\nActivity Listing showed that the County received and investigated a complaint about SOS' s\noperation    in 2003.   Additionally, the Case Activity Listing stated that Mason County had\n\npreviously granted Steven two building permits for a single metal shop. However, Steven had\n\nwithdrawn his metal shop permit applications while they were pending.\n\n        The Case Activity Listing also stated that subsequent to granting the metal shop building\n\npermits, Mason County granted Steven both a 1994 carport permit and a permit for Steven to\n\nbuild an addition to the storage shed. Mason County granted these two permits for private use\n\nunder the old Uniform Building Code.\n\n\n\n                                                    S\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n       The Case Activity Listing stated that the carport permit revealed that the carport had\n\nreplaced another structure. However, because Mason County had not granted the two older\n\nmetal shop permits, it could not find physical copies of these permits. Nonetheless, Mason\n\nCounty assumed that the planner who had reviewed the carport permit application approved the\n\ncarport' permit on grounds that the structure was of equal or lesser intensity than the permitted\n\nmetal shop it had replaced. The Case Activity Listing stated that SOS could continue operating\n\nas an existing cottage industry, because SOS' s operation had not substantially changed since its\n\nstart in 1994.\n\n\nB.      The Loves' Case at Trial\n\n\n        1.    The Loves' Neighbors\n\n\n        The Loves presented the testimony of three neighbors who lived near the Loves'\n\nproperty: James David, William Jacobs, and Elliot Gordon.\n\n        David testified that he generally did not use the SR 106 side of his property due to the\n\nroad noise. He testified that SOS only ran engines for \" minutes\" and that SOS' s operations\n\nbothered     neither   David   nor   his    guests.   1 Verbatim Report   of   Proceedings ( VRP)   at   125. David\n\n\ntestified that motorcycles on SR 106 produced the loudest source of noise, while SOS was about\n\nas loud as the Kruegers' leaf blower. He further testified that SOS produced no fumes.\n\n        Jacobs testified that the noise, fumes, or smoke from SOS had never bothered him.\n\nJacobs confirmed that the Kruegers used a leaf blower daily when leaves were falling. Jacobs\n\nhad not observed any traffic safety problems at SOS.\n\n        Gordon testified that SOS              produced   no odors or   fumes. Gordon testified that just about\n\n\neveryone parked        their   boats   on   the         of way.\n                                                  right -  -      Gordon testified that he knew   of no   traffic\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -11\n\n\nsafety problems caused by SOS, and that Steven used safety precautions when moving boats into\n\nthe Loves' shop. Gordon also testified that SOS' s engine noises did not bother him, and that\n\nmotorcycles on SR 106 bothered him more.\n\n\n       2. SOS' s Customers\n\n\n       The Loves presented the testimony of several of SOS' s customers who had their outboard\n\nmotors serviced at    SOS.    These customers uniformly testified-that Steven was highly safety\n\nconscious, never caused traffic problems, had a procedure to quickly remove boats from the\n\nroad, and used appointments to ensure that SOS was never overwhelmed with boats. Two\n\ncustomers testified that SR 106 regularly had numerous boats, delivery trucks, and other vehicles\n\nparked on its shoulder. Two customers testified to their ability to talk to Steven in his shop with\n\nthe motors running.\n\n        3. Steven Love\n\n\n        Steven testified on his own behalf. Steven testified that he worked on motors usually\n\nbetween 10: 30 AM and 5: 00 PM, that he typically ran motors for 15 minutes per day at the most,.\n\nand that he ran the motors on idle 95 per cent of that time. He also testified that he generally ran\n\nmotors on open throttle for no more than 30 seconds.\n\n\n        Regarding smoke production, Steven testified that while he used to do a \" fogging\"\n\nprocedure that produced a lot of smoke, he had not done it since 2000. 2 VRP at 323 -24. He\n\ntestified that two   photos   showing   smoke at   his property   occurred   before 2001.   Steven also\n\n\ntestified that while he did not do anything in his shop that caused excessive smoke, he sometimes\n\nused a wood stove that made smoke.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       0\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n         Regarding the permitting of the structures on his property, Steven testified that he\n\nreplaced a carport attached to his house with a larger carport. Steven testified that as far as he\n\nknew, his contractor had obtained the proper permits for the carport. Steven also testified that he\n\nhad no awareness of any shoreline permit for SOS.4\n          Steven testified that no one informed him that SOS was out of compliance with any law.\n\nSteven further admitted that his customers used the SR 106 right -of way when delivering boats,\n                                                                     -\n\nbut   stated   that   he did   not require   them to   do   so.    Steven testified that he stored boats on his\n\n\nproperty behind his shop or in his carports.\n\nC.        The Trial Court' s Decision\n\n\n          The trial court issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court concluded,\n\n\n    Plaintiffs have not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants' business is a\n\nnuisance nor that they are entitled to injunctive relief under any of the theories presented.\"\n\nClerk' s Papers ( CP) at 114 -15. The trial court consequently dismissed the Moores' claims.\n\n          After the trial court issued its decision, the Loves moved for, and were awarded, attorney\n\nfees in the      amount of $36,      034. 69.   The Moores appealed. After this first appeal, we remanded\n\n\nfor the trial court to produce a more complete set of findings and conclusions.\n\nD.        Post -\n               Appeal Procedural History\n\n          After remand, the Moores petitioned the trial court to reopen the case to enter a series of\n\n\npublic records        regarding the permitting      of   SOS. The Moores wanted to introduce this evidence\n\n\n\n\n4\n    Based   on   this   testimony,   the Moores    argue, \"       It was conceded at trial that Respondents did not\nhave    shoreline permits        for their business    operations.\"       Br. of Appellant at 20. But Steven simply\ntestified that he was not aware of any shoreline permit.

The trial court\n\ndenied the Moores' motion to reopen.\n\n\n          The trial court entered amended and supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw. The trial court entered numerous factual findings to support its conclusions that SOS' s\n\noperation did not constitute a nuisance because, on balance, SOS' s operation did not constitute\n\nan unreasonable burden on the Moores' use and enjoyment of their land.\n\n          The trial court made no findings as to whether SOS operated lawfully. Instead, the trial\n\ncourt found that SOS operated primarily from a rebuilt carport on the Loves' property that was -\n\npermitted by Mason County. The trial court also found that the County took no action on a 2003\n\ncomplaint regarding operation of the boat repair business. The trial court found that Mason\n\nCounty allowed SOS to continue as a cottage industry.\n\n          The trial court concluded that whether SOS operated lawfully was irrelevant to both the\n\nnuisance in fact and nuisance per se claims. The trial court supported this conclusion with its\n\nstatement that both theories of nuisance require a plaintiff to establish an unreasonable\n\n\ninterference with their use and enjoyment of land, which the Moores had failed to prove.\n\n                                                                                             5\n          The trial   court   further   concluded   that the Land Use Petition Act ( LUPA)       statute of\n\n\n\n\nlimitations barred the Moores' nuisance per se claim, because Mason County had approved SOS\n\nto   operate as a \" cottage    industry.\" CP at 240 -42.

Our Supreme Court held that the trial court\n\nabused its discretion when it denied the plaintiff' s motion to reopen to introduce this evidence,\n\nbecause the evidence was dispositive and because the plaintiff was not at fault for failing to\n\ndiscover the   evidence   before trial. 54 Wn.2d at 74.\n\n\n        Rochester is distinguishable. Here, the Moores offer no explanation for failing to\n\nproduce the permitting evidence at trial. At the Moores' behest, the trial court admitted evidence\n\nconcerning SOS' s permitting. After remand, the Moores moved the trial court to reopen to admit\n\npublic records regarding these same permitting issues; records that had been in existence years\n\nbefore the trial. The Moores do not describe any prior efforts to acquire these public records\n\nbefore the trial, nor do they allege a lack of knowledge as to these records' existence. It is not an\n\nabuse of discretion for a trial court to refuse to reopen a case to allow a party to belatedly submit\n\nevidence they could have, but failed to produce at trial.

Specifically, the Moores argue that substantial\n\n evidence does not support the trial court' s findings regarding noise, smoke, fumes, and traffic\n\n impacts.

Findings Regarding Noise\n\n           The Moores argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court' s findings\n\n\nregarding the impact          of   SOS'   s noise on     their property: (      1) the outboard motor noise from SOS\n\n\nwas not    deafening,     even      up   close; (   2) Krueger characterized the noise' s frequency as periodic,\n\nand that Krueger heard SOS' s noise only when she was outside her home, when she got her mail,\n\nand when she worked             in her flower        gardens; (   3) Moore' s testimony regarding the frequency and\n\nvolume of       the   noise   lacked credibility; ( 4)      none of the Moores' neighbors, particularly David,\n\nJacobs,    and    Gordon, had any         problems with        SOS'      s noise; (   5) the beeping of SOS' s tractor had\n\nnot occurred       in the last     couple of years; (     6) the motors on boats and jet skis and leaf blowers\n\n\nmade noise in the same region as. SOS; and ( 7) the motor vehicle traffic on SR 106, including\n\n\n7\n    The Moores argue that the trial court misapplied the preponderance of the evidence standard,\nsuggesting that we should review the findings under a preponderance of the evidence standard.\nBut we review findings of fact for substantial evidence. Saviano, 144 Wn. App. at78.\n\n\n                                                                    11\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nmotorcycles, produced the most significant noise source in the area. We hold that substantial\n\nevidence supports all of these factual findings.\n\n\n         Two customers testified to their ability to talk to Steven in his shop with the motors\n\nrunning. Krueger'       s own   testimony   supported       that   she   heard the   noise \"   periodically,\"   as well as\n\n\n\nthe   specific places   that she heard the   noise.    1 VRP at 16. David, Jacobs, and Gordon all testified\n\n\nthat the noise did not bother them at all. Krueger admitted that SOS had not used the tractor\n\nbeeper for years, and that she regularly used a leaf blower that made noise. Krueger' s use of the\n\nleaf blower was confirmed by two neighbors' testimonies. Four witnesses' testimonies all\n\nconfirmed that SR 106 noise was significantly louder than noise produced by SOS.\n\n          The Moores argue that the Loves' witnesses lived farther away from SOS than the\n\nMoores, or lived there less frequently than the Kruegers,. such that the Loves' witnesses did not\n\nprovide substantial evidence to support the trial court' s findings regarding noise. The Moores\n\nalso attack the trial court' s determination that Krueger' s testimony regarding the noise' s duration\n\nand volume lacked credibility. The Moores' argument is actually a request for us to reweigh the\n\nevidence, couched in terms of a substantial evidence argument. We do not reweigh evidence, but\n\ndefer to the trial court regarding witness credibility. City of University Place, 144 Wn.2d at 652.\n                                                                                                8\nSubstantial   evidence supports      the trial   court' s   findings relating to       noise.\n\n\n\n\n8\n    The Moores argue that the trial court erred by focusing on the duration of the use of SR 106,\ninstead of focusing on its repetitiveness, when determining nuisance in fact. The Moores do not\nsupport this proposition with any legal authority, and thus we do not consider it. See Escude v.\nKing County Public Hosp. Dist.

Findings Regarding Smoke and Fumes\n\n         The Moores also argue that substantial evidence does not support the trial court' s\n\nfindings regarding the   smoke and   fumes   produced     by   SOS: (    1) while SOS' s running of motors\n\nproduced some smoke, SOS ran motors for only 15 minutes per day, and was a clean and\n\nenvironmentally    conscious   company; ( 2) the smoke and fumes did not bother the other adjacent\n\n\nneighbors, including David, Jacobs, and Gordon; and ( 3) the area had other sources of smoke at\n\ntimes.   Substantial evidence supports all of these factual findings.\n\n\n         A great deal of testimony supports the trial court' s findings regarding the smoke and\n\nfumes SOS produced. David, Jacobs, and Gordon all testified that the smoke did not bother\n\nthem, and /or that they had never even noticed it. Krueger testified that the motors ran \"just\n\nperiodically.\"   1 VRP at 16. David testified that he heard the motors for only minutes a day.\n\nJacobs testified that he heard   engines   revving up \"   once   in   a while.\"   1 VRP   at   142. Steven\n\n\ntestified that in an entire day he typically ran motors for 15 minutes at the most, 95 per cent of\n\nwhich was on idle. He also testified that he generally ran motors on open throttle for no more\n\nthan 30 seconds. Testimony clearly established that the busy SR 106 was nearby, producing\npotential alternative sources of smoke. Steven testified that he and the Kruegers had wood\n\nstoves which caused a great deal of smoke at times.\n\n\n         It is true that Moore testified that smoke and fumes occasionally presented a problem on\n\nher property, and that Krueger testified that smoke and fumes from SOS reached her property. It\n\nis also true that the Moores submitted photographs showing several plumes or hazes of smoke,\n\npurportedly from SOS. Thus the testimony conflicted, and the trial court resolved the conflict in\n\n\n\n\n                                                     13\n\fNo. 41557 - -II\n          7\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nfavor of the Loves. We defer to that decision. City of University Place, 144 Wn.2d at 652.\n\nSubstantial evidence supported the trial court' s findings regarding smoke and fumes.\n\nC.       Findings Regarding Traffic Impacts\n\n         The Moores further argue that substantial evidence failed to support the trial court' s\n\nfindings regarding SOS'            s effect on   traffic   on   SR 106: ( 1) that no accidents had occurred on SR\n\n\n106 for the     previous   20   years; (   2) that SOS'     s operation was       low   volume; ( 3)   that SOS' s operation\n\n\n                                                                 did         deviate from SR 106'          typical              4)\nonly had brief use           the              that this\n                        of         road and                use         not                             s             usage; (\n\n\n\n\nthat SOS' s use of SR 106 obstructed neither traffic, nor anyone else' s use of SR 106. We hold\n\nthat substantial evidence supports all of these factual findings.\n\n         Krueger testified that no serious accident had occurred on SR 106. Krueger, two\n\nneighbors, and a customer all testified that SR 106 had a great deal of traffic other than that\n\nproduced    by   SOS.    Gordon testified that no one, including SOS, had caused traffic congestion\n\nproblems, and        that \" everybody      parks   boats    on   the         of-way.\"\n                                                                       right -            1 VRP at 177. Two customers\n\n\ntestified that SR 106 regularly had numerous boats, delivery trucks, and other vehicles parked on\n\nthe shoulder.\n\n\n\n          Steven testified that he stored boats on his property behind his shop or in his carports,\n\nrather   than   on   SR 106.       Gordon testified that he knew of no traffic safety problems caused by\n\nSOS, and that Steven took safety precautions when moving boats. Many of SOS' s customers\n\nconfirmed that Steven was highly safety conscious, testifying that SOS never caused traffic\n\nproblems, and had procedures to quickly move boats off of SR 106 so as to ensure that SOS was\n\nnever overwhelmed with boats.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                  14\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n         Both Krueger and Moore testified that SOS' s customers and delivery trucks used the SR\n\n106         of -\n      right -  way,     potentially      impeding    traffic   and    causing safety   concerns.   However, the trial\n\n\ncourt resolved this conflict in favor of the Loves and we defer to that decision. City of University\n\nPlace, 144 Wn.2d        at   652.

Here Mason County allowed SOS to\noperate without a permit as a \" cottage                 industry.\"      Ex. 7.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     19\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nproduced an order declaring improper a Mason County interpretive decision relating to the\n\nLoves' use of their land.\n\n\n       The trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that LUPA precludes the Moores' claims\n\nfor three reasons. First, the Case Activity Listing was the result of a low -\n                                                                            level case study\n\nsummarily dismissing a complaint. This does not constitute a land use decision as defined by\n\nLUPA, because Mason County was not determining whether SOS could legally continue to\n\noperate on the Loves' property without further permits. Rather, it was summarily dismissing a\n\ncomplaint for lack of evidence.\n\n\n        Second, even if we assume that the Mason County Case Activity Listing constituted a\n\nfinal land use decision regarding whether SOS is a cottage industry, this decision did not impact\n\nthe Moores'    claim —  whether SOS is operating without a shoreline conditional use permit.\n\nMason County requires cottage industries to obtain conditional use permits, and thus whether\n\nSOS is a \" cottage industry\" does, not resolve the legality of the Loves' commercial use of their\n                                                     14\nproperty for SOS. MCC 17. 03. 021; 17. 50. 040.           Third, the Moores raised additional arguments\n\n\nas to why SOS' s operations constitute nuisance per se that do not involve any permitting\n\ndecision. For example, the Moores argue that SOS violated the Mason County noise ordinance,\n\nchapter 9. 36 MCC, and violated the WSDOT' s regulations. Mason County' s Case Activity\n\n\n\n\n14 Mason County Code' s Shoreline Management Master Program states in the definitions section\nthat cottage industries must obtain a conditional use permit. MCC 17. 50. 040. The broader\ndevelopment rules section of the Mason County Code requires a cottage industry to obtain a\nconditional use permit unless it can meet seven requirements, including that the cottage industry\nuses \"[ n] o equipment or process . . .   which creates noise, vibration, glare, fumes, odors, or\nelectrical   interference detectable to the   normal senses   off the property.\" MCC 17. 03. 021( 6)\n emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                     20\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\nListing did not discuss, and, thus cannot constitute a land use decision on, these issues. Thus, the\n\ntrial court erred in asserting that LUPA bars the Moores' nuisance per se claim.\n\n       B.         Improper Reasonableness Balancing\n\n       The Moores argue that the trial court erred in ruling that because SOS' s interference with\n\nthe Moores' land was not unreasonable, their nuisance per se claim must fail.

However, establishing any\n\ninterference of a plaintiff' s use and enjoyment of property caused by acts violating a law satisfies\n\nnuisance per se, regardless of      the interference'      s reasonableness.    Tiegs, 83 Wn. App. at 418.\n\n         The trial court stated in its findings that SOS, on balance, did not have an unreasonable\n\nimpact on the Moores' use and enjoyment of their land.

ATTORNEY FEES AT TRIAL\n\n\n         Finally, the Moores argue that the trial court erred in granting the Loves attorney fees,\n\narguing a number of theories. We hold that ( 1) the Loves are entitled to attorney fees under\n\nRCW 90. 58. 230 because they            prevailed on      the Shoreline Management Act   claim, ( 2)   the trial\n\n\ncourt did not need to make a finding of bad faith to award attorney fees under the SMA, but (3)\n\nthe trial court impermissibly failed to segregate the fees. We reverse the attorney fee award,\n\nbecause the trial court improperly segregated the fees of the Loves' trial counsel Finlay, and then\n\nremand for a recalculation of fees consistent with our opinion.\n\n\nA.       Applicability of the SAM s Attorney Fee Provision\n\n         The Moores argue that the trial court had no lawful basis for awarding attorney fees\n\nunder the SMA' s attorney fee provision. RCW 90. 58. 230. The Moores contend that the SMA\n\ndid not make attorney fees available because the Moores did not make a claim under the SMA.\n\n\n16 The Loves argue that this court should dismiss the Moores' nuisance per se claim because the\nMoores failed to prove whether or not SOS had proper permits, citing Gill v. LDI, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2530232\"><a href=\"/opinion/2530232/gill-v-ldi/\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. 2d at\n\n 1191 -92, 1199 -1200.\n\n\n        Unlike Gill, which dealt with factual disputes on summary judgment, this case concerns a\ntrial court' s erroneous legal conclusion regarding nuisance per se following a bench trial. We\nreview this erroneous conclusion of law de novo. Because the trial court' s erroneous conclusion\nof law led it to refrain from making a factual finding as to whether or not SOS had proper\npermitting, remand is the appropriate remedy so as to resolve the factual dispute.\n\n\n                                                               Im\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 - II\n\n\nThe Moores argue that they abandoned all damages claims during trial, meaning that they could\n\nnot have possibly had a claim under the SMA, given that the SMA limits private parties' relief to\n\ndamages. Thus the Moores argue that the Loves did not \" prevail\" on an SMA claim, and cannot\n\ncollect   attorney fees      under   the SMA.    See Br.   of   Appellants      at   45.

At closing   argument,     the Moores    stated, \"   While the plaintiffs are not necessarily\n\nseeking damages, damages are allowed both under the nuisance statute and state ` Shoreline\n\nManagement Act'         and should      be   considered   by   the   court.\"    CP at 160.\n\n\n          The Moores argue that when making the determination of whether the Moores made a\n\nclaim for damages, the trial court should have limited itself to considering only admitted\n\nevidence. Thus, the Moores argue that the trial court should have disregarded the Moores'\n\n\nclosing argument (because closing arguments are not evidence) and should have instead focused\n\non the testimonies of Moore and Krueger, both of whom testified that they wanted only to\n\nprevent SOS from operating.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                25\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 -II\n\n\n         However, the Moores cite no authority suggesting that a trial court may consider admitted\n\nevidence only when determining whether a party made a claim. Nor do they cite any authority\n\nthat a party may abandon a claim via witness testimony, or that such an abandonment would be\n\neffective in the face of a subsequent request at closing argument that the trial court considers the\n\nclaim. We hold that the record reflects no abandonment of the SMA claim and that the SMA\n\n\nauthorizes attorney fees in this case.\n\nB.       RCW 90.58.230' s Attorney Fee Provision\n\n         The Moores argue that the trial court violated RCW 90. 58. 230, because it allows the trial\n\n\ncourt to impose attorney fee awards only against a party who has litigated in bad faith. The\n\nLoves argue that the statute allows the trial court discretionary imposition of attorney fees\n\nagainst parties,   irrespective      of   bad faith. II Br.   of   Respondents      at   13.

This $ 16, 812. 50   included fees that Finlay accrued by defending the Loves in a district\n\ncourt criminal case regarding their dock and jet ski float. The Moores had complained about the\n\ndock and jet ski float on June 5, 2007, almost one year after filing their lawsuit against the Loves\n\non June 23, 2006. Finlay stated by declaration that he charged $2, 000 for this district court\n\ncriminal case. Finlay stated not only that the Kruegers instigated the district court criminal case\n\nthrough their complaint, but also that he used the legal research from the district court case to\n\ndefend the Loves against the Moores' civil suit.\n\n\n          The trial court concluded that the time Finlay spent on the district court criminal case was\n\ntoo integrated with the litigation against the Moores for separation. The trial court did this\n\nbecause Finlay used much of the research done in defending the criminal complaint in the case\n\nagainst the Moores, and because the compliant occurred after the litigation with the Moores\n\nbegan.\n\n\n           It is well settled that courts may decline to segregate fees for unsuccessful claims when\n\nsuch claims are too intertwined to reasonably separate. Dice, 131 Wn. App. at 690. However,\n\nno authority states that courts may combine the fees for separate cases in separate courts on this\n\nbasis.\n\n\n\n\n 18\n      When the trial court reduced the attorney fee award from $36, 034. 69 to $28, 907.44, it took the\n difference out of Eisenhower and Carlson, PLLC' s fees, and did not reduce the amount awarded\nto Finlay. In its amendment to the attorney fee award, the trial court maintained that it had no\n obligation to segregate the fees Finlay incurred. The trial court ruled that it need not segregate\n attorney fees where the claims are too integrated to properly segregate them.\n\n\n                                                             3\n\fNo. 41557 -7 -II\nConsolidated with No. 44377 -5 - II\n\n\n         Although the district court case may have concerned the same legal issues as the Moores'\n\nnuisance suit and shared background research, this is not sufficient to justify merging a criminal\n\ncase in district court with a civil case in superior court. Moreover, Finlay himself segregated the\n\nbilling for the district court case. Finlay stated by declaration that he billed the Loves a $2,000\n\nflat fee for the district court case, while he billed a $ 5, 000 flat fee for the Moores' civil suit.\n\nFurthermore, one case focused on the Loves' dock and jet ski float, whereas the other case\n\nfocused    on   the   operation of   SOS.   Thus, not only could the trial court have segregated the cases,\n\nthe Loves' attorney Finlay had already segregated them. The trial court abused its discretion by\n\ngranting the Loves attorney fees for the district court case. We reverse the award of attorney fees\n\nfor the district court case.\n\n\n                                        ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n\n\n          The Loves request attorney fees on appeal under the SMA' s RCW 90. 58. 230. See RAP\n\n18. 1.   The Loves argue that RCW 90. 58. 230 authorizes such fees.
