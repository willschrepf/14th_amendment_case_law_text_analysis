Plaintiffs-appellees,\n\nNational Solid Wastes Management Association (NSWMA), BFI Waste\n\nSystems   of     Mississippi,    LLC   (BFI),    and   Waste    Management   of\n\nMississippi, Inc. (Waste Management) (collectively, plaintiffs),\n\nfiled this suit against defendants-appellants, the Authority and\n\nits member cities and counties, claiming that the flow control\n\nordinances violated the dormant Commerce Clause.                  Defendants-\n\nappellants now timely appeal the judgment, rendered after a bench\n\ntrial, declaring the flow control ordinance invalid under the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause and enjoining their enforcement.                     We\n\ndismiss plaintiffs’ complaint in part for want of standing and with\n\nrespect to     the   remainder    we   reverse   and   render    judgment    for\n\ndefendants–appellants.\n\n                        Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n     In   1989    and   1990,   several    cities   and   counties   in    South\n\nMississippi developed a master plan for the management of the solid\n\nwaste in the region.        The goal of the plan was to develop an\n\nenvironmentally-sensitive        and   cost-effective      program   for     the\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\fdisposal of the region’s solid waste.              Among other things, the\n\nmaster plan recommended the creation of a regional solid waste\n\nmanagement authority and the construction of a regional landfill.\n\nIn 1992, the Authority was formed and the plan was adopted.                   At\n\nthat time, the Authority was made up of five counties (Covington,\n\nJones, Perry, Forrest, and Lamar) and three cities (Petal, Laurel,\n\nand Hattiesburg) in Mississippi (collectively, the Members).                  By\n\nthe time this suit was filed, Forrest and Lamar Counties had\n\nwithdrawn from the Authority.\n\n      In 1992, the Authority issued a request for proposals (RFP) to\n\ninterested parties, including plaintiffs BFI and Waste Management,\n\nregarding the regional landfill.           Proposals were to be given for\n\ntwo options: 1) to own, design, permit, build, and operate the\n\nlandfill for thirty years or 2) to equip and operate the landfill\n\nfor seven     years,   with   the   Authority    building    and   owning    the\n\nlandfill. The RFP included an estimated volume of disposable solid\n\nwaste that would be generated in the geographic area comprised by\n\nthe Members1 and a statement that “[u]pon request, the Authority\n\n\n      1\n        The 1992 RFP estimated the annual volume of disposable waste in the\nRegion to be 153,000 tons. That estimate, however, was derived before Forrest\nand Lamar Counties withdrew from the Authority.        After these two counties\nwithdrew (which was prior to July 2002), the projected volume of waste for the\nAuthority’s Region would have been about 129,000–130,000 tons per year.\n      When creating the master plan and issuing the RFP, the Authority\ncontemplated, at least implicitly, that all solid waste generated within the\nRegion would be disposed of at the landfill that was the subject of the RFP. The\nAuthority’s landfill is, and always has been, the only “Subtitle D” landfill\nwithin the Region. A Subtitle D landfill is one that is compliant with federal\nregulations, issued pursuant to Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. § 6941, et. seq., setting the criteria for\nsanitary landfills.\n\n                                       3\n\fwill require each [Member] . . . to adopt and enforce a flow\n\ncontrol ordinance in order to assure that the entirety of the . .\n\n. waste stream generated within the [geographic area comprised by\n\nthe Members] will be managed and disposed of at the [Authority’s\n\nlandfill].”    Five proposals were received, including from BFI and\n\nWaste Management.        Enviro, a company headquartered in Laurel,\n\nMississippi, submitted the lowest bid for Option 2, but did not\n\nsubmit a bid for Option 1.            The Authority analyzed the bids,\n\ndecided to own the landfill, and began implementation discussions\n\nwith Enviro prior to actual contract negotiations.\n\n      In 1996, the Authority issued revenue bonds to finance the\n\nconstruction of the landfill and three transfer stations.2             Also in\n\n1996, Enviro signed a contract with the Authority to operate the\n\nAuthority’s landfill,3 located in Perry County and completed in\n\n1997, and transfer stations.        The initial term of the contract was\n\nfor the life of the first landfill cell or seven years, whichever\n\nwas less, and was to be automatically extended for one-year terms\n\nso long as both parties mutually agreed.            In 2000, the Authority\n\nrefinanced the 1996 bonds and issued additional bonds to finance\n\nthe construction of a second cell at the landfill.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        Waste collecting trucks often unload waste locally at a transfer station\nuntil the waste is transported to a landfill for final disposal.\n      3\n       Enviro provides the labor, management, supplies, equipment, and insurance\nfor the landfill and operates the scales and performs all maintenance at the\nlandfill.\n\n                                       4\n\f      The Authority generates revenue by collecting fees for the\n\ndisposal of waste at its landfill and transfer stations.             Thus the\n\nAuthority’s generation of revenue is based on the amount of garbage\n\nthat it receives at its facilities.               To the extent that the\n\nAuthority is unable to generate sufficient income to meet its debt\n\npayments, the Members are obligated to make up the shortfall.\n\n      From the time the landfill opened, the volume of refuse that\n\npassed through and to the Authority’s facilities was significantly\n\nless than the total amount of potential waste generated in the area\n\ncomprised by its Members.         Although the Authority’s issuance of\n\nbonds was based on a projected volume of 140,000 tons per year, in\n\nfiscal year 1998 the landfill’s volume had reached only 105,305\n\ntons and in fiscal year 1999, the volume dropped to 96,032 tons.\n\nIn 1999, in an attempt to increase its trash collection, and\n\ntherefore    its   revenue   generation,    the   Authority    extended    the\n\nservice area of the landfill to include a total of 22 counties,\n\nwhich allowed the Authority to receive waste at its landfill from\n\nthe additional counties which were not Members.4           While the volume\n\nof trash deposited at the landfill increased with the expanded\n\nservice area, it reached a high of only 129,017 tons in fiscal year\n\n\n      4\n        According to its contract with the Authority, Enviro was obligated to\nbring to the Authority’s landfill all the waste it collected within a 75-mile\nradius of the landfill.      The area comprised by the 22 counties roughly\ncorresponds to this 75-mile radius. The flow control ordinances, however, apply\nonly to the three counties and three cities that are Members of the Authority.\nWhen the Authority first created its plan for the landfill, the service area\nincluded only the five original member counties (Covington, Jones, Perry,\nForrest, and Lamar); the expanded service area added an additional 17 counties.\n\n                                      5\n\f2000, with the tonnage decreasing thereafter (to 108,625 in 2001\n\nand to 95,205 in 2002).\n\n      Due to an insufficient flow of rubbish through and to its\n\nfacilities, the Authority realized that, at the current volume of\n\nwaste, it would not be able to make its July 1, 2004 bond payment.\n\nBelieving that its facilities needed more garbage to remain viable,\n\nthe Authority adopted a resolution on July 10, 2002, directing its\n\nMembers   to   adopt   flow   control       ordinances   requiring    that   all\n\nmunicipal solid waste generated within the then Member counties\n\n(Covington,    Jones   and    Perry)    and    cities    (Petral,   Laurel   and\n\nHattiesburg) respectively [collectively, the Region] be transported\n\nto its landfill or one of its transfer stations.5                   Each Member\n\nenacted identical ordinances, each applicable only within the\n\ngeographic area of the particular enacting Member, with September\n\n1, 2002, as the effective date.6              Each ordinance provided that\n\nnoncompliance therewith would constitute a misdemeanor.\n\n      Following the enactment of the ordinances, plaintiffs on\n\nAugust 29, 2002 filed this suit against the Authority and its\n\nMembers, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief under\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        According to testimony at trial, the amount of trash currently leaving\nthe Region is between 50,000 to 70,0000 tons per year; if this trash were\ndirected to the Authority’s landfill, the tonnage disposed of at the landfill\nwould likely be over 140,000, roughly the amount needed to meet the Authority’s\ndebt obligations.\n      6\n        The flow control ordinances were subsequently reenacted in September,\nOctober, and November of 2002.\n\n                                        6\n\f42 U.S.C. § 1983.7        Plaintiffs BFI and Waste Management collect,\n\nprocess, and dispose of commercial and residential solid waste and\n\ncurrently    ship   the    trash   they     collect    within    the    Region    to\n\nlandfills and transfer stations that they either own and operate or\n\nthat are owned and operated by affiliated companies.                   At the time\n\nof the suit, solid waste collected by BFI and Waste Management\n\nwithin the Region was and had been eventually transported to\n\nlandfills outside of the Region, but within Mississippi; none of\n\nsuch waste was (or had been) transported outside of Mississippi\n\n(nor did any of it originate as waste outside of Mississippi).8\n\nThe flow control ordinances would require that BFI and Waste\n\nManagement dispose of waste they collect within the Region only at\n\nthe Authority’s landfill in Perry County.\n\n      After the filing of the complaint, the parties agreed that the\n\nenforcement of the ordinances would await the outcome of the case.\n\nIn October 2002, the Mississippi State Attorney General intervened\n\non behalf of Mississippi to defend a potential constitutional\n\nchallenge    to   the     Mississippi     statute     pursuant   to     which    the\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        Pine Belt Waste Systems, LLC, also joined with plaintiffs in bringing\nthis suit. Pine Belt Waste, however, was voluntarily dismissed as a plaintiff\non November 25, 2002, prior to trial.\n      8\n        Although the Authority’s landfill is the only Subtitle D landfill within\nthe Region, see supra note 1, the landfills to which BFI and Waste Management\ncurrently haul garbage generated within the Region are Subtitle D landfills. BFI\ncurrently hauls waste collected within the Region to its landfill in Madison\nCounty, Mississippi, and Waste Management hauls its waste to a landfill owned and\noperated by an affiliated company in Scott County, Mississippi.\n\n                                        7\n\fAuthority was authorized to direct its Members to enact the flow\n\ncontrol ordinances.       See MISS. CODE. ANN. § 17-17-319(2).\n\n      Trial was held in December 2002 before the district judge\n\nwithout a jury.        After the trial, but before a decision was\n\nrendered, Perry County filed a motion to dismiss for lack of\n\njurisdiction based on the “adequate state grounds” doctrine.                Also\n\nfollowing the trial, the district judge recused himself on his own\n\nmotion, and the matter was subsequently properly assigned, with\n\nconsent of the parties, to a magistrate judge for decision.                   On\n\nApril 23, 2003, the magistrate judge denied the motion to dismiss\n\nand   issued   findings    of   fact   and   conclusions     of   law   and   an\n\naccompanying      judgment,     deciding     that    the    ordinances      were\n\nunconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause and enjoining\n\ntheir enforcement.9      Defendants on May 22, 2003, timely filed their\n\nnotice of appeal.\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n      Defendants contend that the flow control ordinances do not\n\nviolate the dormant Commerce Clause.10              We dismiss the dormant\n\n\n      9\n        No damages were awarded. While the judgment purports to generally award\n“attorneys fees,” no amount thereof is stated in the judgment (or in the findings\nand conclusions) and we are informed by the parties that plaintiffs have in\nsubstance waived attorneys fees under this judgment by failing to file any\nevidence of the amount of attorneys fees or any motion in connection therewith\nas contemplated in FED. R. CIV. P. 54(d)92) and the local rules.\n      10\n          Defendants also contend that the district court lacked jurisdiction\nbecause plaintiffs did not appeal the Member counties’ and cities’ adoption of\nthe ordinances to a state circuit court as authorized by Miss. Code Ann. 11-51-\n75. See Benedict v. City of Hattiesburg, 693 So. 2d 377, 380 (Miss. 1997); Falco\nLime Inc. v. Mayor & Aldermen of City of Vicksburg, 836 So. 2d 711, 716 (Miss.\n2002). We reject that contention. The instant suit is one under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n                                       8\n\fCommerce Clause claim in part for lack of standing and reverse with\n\nrespect to the remainder of the claim.\n\n      A.    Standard of Review\n\n      Review of questions of constitutional law is de novo.              United\n\nStates v. Hemmingson, 157 F.3d 347, 355 (5th Cir. 1998).                     The\n\nmagistrate judge’s findings of fact, however, are reviewed for\n\nclear error.     City of New Orleans v. Mun. Admin. Servs., Inc., 376\n\nF.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir. 2004).\n\n      B.    Dormant Commerce Clause Analysis\n\n      Although the Commerce Clause is an affirmative grant of power\n\nto Congress, U.S. CONST. art I, § 8, cl. 3, the Supreme Court has\n\ninterpreted the clause to contain a negative aspect, the so-called\n\n“dormant” Commerce Clause.        Dickerson v. Bailey, 336 F.3d 388, 395\n\n(5th Cir. 2003).     The dormant Commerce Clause “‘prohibits economic\n\nprotectionism—that is, regulatory measures designed to benefit\n\nin-state      economic      interests       by    burdening       out-of-state\n\ncompetitors.’”      Id. (quoting Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 112 S.Ct. 789,\n\n800 (1992)).\n\n\n\n\n1983 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against local government\nordinances adopted under color of state law on the ground that the ordinances are\ninvalid under and contrary to the United States Constitution. See Dennis v.\nHiggins, 111 S.Ct. 865 (1991); National Private Truck Council v. Oklahoma Tax\nComm’n, 115 S.Ct. 2351, 2353-54 (1995). “When federal claims are premised on 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 . . . we have not required exhaustion of state judicial or\nadministrative remedies.” Steffel v. Thompson, 94 S.Ct. 1209, 1222 (1974). See\nalso Self-Ins. Inst. of America, Inc. v. Korioth, 993 F.2d 479, 482 (5th Cir.\n1993).\n\n                                        9\n\f       We begin our dormant Commerce Clause analysis by asking\n\nwhether     the     ordinances    “(1)    facially    discriminate       against\n\nout-of-state economic interests, or (2) regulate evenhandedly and\n\nthereby evince only an indirect burden on interstate commerce.”\n\nDickerson, 336 F.3d at 396.            In other words, we ask whether the\n\nordinances    “reflect[]     a    discriminatory      purpose     or   merely    a\n\ndiscriminatory effect.”          Id.   “Although . . . there is no clear\n\nline   of   separation    between      these   two”   classifications,       “the\n\nthreshold    determination       is    significant    if   only    because      it\n\nestablishes the constitutional standard of review.”               Id. (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).\n\n       Regarding the first category, “[s]tate laws discriminating\n\nagainst interstate commerce on their face are virtually per se\n\ninvalid.”    Id. (internal quotations and citations omitted).                The\n\nordinance will be unconstitutional unless the state actor “can\n\ndemonstrate, under rigorous scrutiny, that it has no other means to\n\nadvance a legitimate local interest.” Id. (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).        “At a minimum such facial discrimination\n\ninvokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local\n\npurpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.”\n\nHughes v. Oklahoma, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1737 (1979). “Under this strict\n\nscrutiny, . . . the state bears the heavy burden to rescue its\n\nstatutes.”        Dickerson, 336 F.3d at 396 (internal quotations and\n\ncitations omitted).       “This burden is stringent” and the statute at\n\n\n                                         10\n\fissue is “generally struck down . . . without further inquiry.”\n\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n      With   the   second    category—the     “evenhanded     statutes”     that\n\neffectuate a legitimate local interest and that only incidentally\n\naffect interstate commerce—we apply the “Pike balancing test.” The\n\nstatute will be upheld unless the burden it imposes on interstate\n\ncommerce is “‘clearly excessive in relation to the putative local\n\nbenefits.’” Id. (quoting Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 90 S.Ct. 844,\n\n847 (1970)).\n\n      The magistrate judge struck down the flow control ordinances,\n\nfinding them to be to be facially discriminatory against interstate\n\ncommerce. The magistrate judge also determined that the ordinances\n\nwould not pass the Pike test, assuming arguendo, as defendants\n\nargued, that the ordinances were not facially discriminatory.\n\n      C.     Plaintiffs’ Standing\n\n      Before we consider the merits, we must first determine whether\n\nplaintiffs BFI and Waste Management have standing to challenge the\n\nflow control ordinances.11       Although defendants have not explicitly\n\nraised the issue of standing, we may consider it sua sponte.              Bauer\n\n\n\n      11\n        As a not-for-profit trade association that represents the interests of\nthe private waste services industry and of which BFI and Waste Management are\nmembers, plaintiff NSWMA’s standing is on this record entirely dependent upon\nwhether BFI and Waste Management having standing. See Public Citizen, Inc. v.\nBomer, 274 F.3d 212, 219 n.5 (5th Cir. 2001) (stating that “organizational\nstanding requires, . . . that individuals have standing to sue in their own\nright”). NSWMA took absolutely no active role in this litigation and has not\nsubmitted anything to establish its standing independent of that of BFI and Waste\nManagement.\n\n                                       11\n\fv. Texas, 341 F.3d 352, 357 (5th Cir. 2003).           Our standing analysis\n\nconsists of constitutional and prudential components.\n\n            1.    Constitutional Standing\n\n      “To meet the constitutional standing requirement, a plaintiff\n\nmust show (1) an injury in fact (2) that is fairly traceable to the\n\nactions of the defendant and (3) that likely will be redressed by\n\na favorable decision.”        Procter & Gamble Co. v. Amway Corp., 242\n\nF.3d 539, 560 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing Bennett v. Spear, 117 S.Ct.\n\n1154, 1161 (1997); Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 112 S.Ct. 2130,\n\n2136 (1992)).\n\n      Plaintiffs meet the constitutional, or Article III, standing\n\nrequirements.     Because of the flow control ordinances, plaintiffs\n\nwill not be able to ship the garbage they collect within the Region\n\nto the landfills of their choice and, as a result, will be forced\n\nto pay a “tipping”12 fee at the Authority’s landfill.             Testimony at\n\ntrial indicates that plaintiffs’ cost to dispose of waste at the\n\nAuthority’s      landfill,    including      the   tipping     fee    and    the\n\ntransportation cost, would be higher than their current cost.13\n\n\n      12\n         In garbage parlance, “tipping” is used in place of the less-refined\n“dumping.”\n      13\n         In addition to a simple comparison of current costs against the costs\nunder the flow control ordinances, other testimony supports plaintiffs’ claim of\nhigher costs.      The ordinances preclude plaintiffs from operating an\n“internalized” business—meaning that they collect, transport, and dispose of the\nwaste using their own facilities. Testimony at trial suggests that such a method\nof operation achieves the best economy of scale for a waste collector. Further,\nBFI and Waste Management would face a reduced volume of waste at the transfer\nstations to which they currently haul waste from the Region, because they most\nlikely cannot economically segregate at the transfer station the waste that comes\nfrom within the Region from that which comes from outside the Region. The result\n\n                                       12\n\fThus, plaintiffs have an injury (higher operating costs) that is\n\ntraceable to the ordinances enacted by defendants and which would\n\nbe remedied if we rule that the ordinances are unconstitutional.\n\n           2.    Prudential Standing\n\n     The more difficult question is whether plaintiffs meet the\n\nprudential standing requirements.           The goal of the prudential\n\nstanding requirements is to “determine whether the plaintiff ‘is a\n\nproper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the\n\nexercise of the court’s remedial powers.’”          Procter & Gamble, 242\n\nF.3d at 560 (quoting Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist., 106\n\nS.Ct. 1326, 1334 n.8 (1986)).\n\n     “These judicially created limits concern whether a\n     plaintiff’s grievance arguably falls within the zone of\n     interests protected by the statutory provision invoked in\n     the suit, whether the complaint raises abstract questions\n     or a generalized grievance more properly addressed by the\n     legislative branch, and whether the plaintiff is\n     asserting his or her own legal rights and interests\n     rather than the legal rights and interests of third\n     parties.” Procter & Gamble, 242 F.3d at 560.\n\n     The key inquiry for prudential standing in this case is\n\nwhether the injury of which plaintiffs complain is “arguably within\n\nthe zone of interests to be protected” by the dormant Commerce\n\nClause, the “constitutional guarantee in question” here.            Ass’n of\n\nData Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 90 S.Ct. 827, 830\n\n(1970).   See also Boston Stock Exch. v. State Tax Comm’n, 97 S.Ct.\n\n\n\nof the reduced volume at the transfer stations would be an increased operating\ncost per ton.\n\n                                     13\n\f599, 603 n.3 (1977) (applying the zone of interests test in the\n\ncontext of the dormant Commerce Clause).           The facts of this case\n\nrequire that we analyze the zone of interest question in two parts:\n\nWe must determine whether plaintiffs have standing to challenge the\n\nflow control ordinances as being facially discriminatory against\n\nout-of-state      economic   interests    or   whether   they   can   merely\n\nchallenge   the    ordinances   as   being     excessively   burdensome   to\n\ninterstate commerce.\n\n\n\n                   a.   Facially Discriminatory\n\n     The two-staged analysis for dormant Commerce Clause claims is\n\ninstructive as to the relevant zone of interests to be protected.\n\nFirst, with respect to laws that facially discriminate against out-\n\nof-state economic interests, the dormant Commerce Clauses seeks to\n\nprotect against local economic protectionism and retaliation among\n\nthe states.    C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 114\n\nS.Ct. 1677, 1682 (1994) (“The central rationale for the rule\n\nagainst discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose\n\nobject is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite\n\nthose jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was\n\ndesigned to prevent.”).       In this context, discrimination “simply\n\nmeans differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic\n\ninterests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.” Oregon\n\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\fWaste Sys., Inc. v. Dep’t of Envtl. Quality of the State of Or.,\n\n114 S.Ct. 1345, 1350 (1994).\n\n       We conclude that plaintiffs’ injury does not fall within the\n\nzone of interests to be protected by the dormant Commerce Clause\n\nwith        respect   to   ordinances   that   are    alleged    to   facially\n\ndiscriminate against out-of-state economic interests.                 The flow\n\ncontrol ordinances mandate that any waste generated within the\n\nRegion be transported to the Authority’s landfill or transfer\n\nstations.        In effect, the ordinances prohibit the export of any\n\nwaste outside of the Region, including out of state.                   However,\n\nthese plaintiffs do not ship (and, so far as the record shows, have\n\nnever shipped) any waste they collect within the Region to any\n\nlocation outside of Mississippi, nor do they ship (and, so far as\n\nthe record shows, have never shipped) any waste from outside of\n\nMississippi to the Region.         Plaintiffs also have not even alleged\n\nthat they have any plans to do so,14 and have not suggested that\n\nsome other party currently ships waste from the Region outside of\n\nMississippi, or has plans to do so, or that any out-of-state waste\n\nprocessor receives (or has plans to receive) any of the Region’s\n\nwaste out of state.         In sum, plaintiffs’ injury is not related to\n\n       14\n        Stone County, a Mississippi county that is now within the Authority’s\nexpanded service area, see supra note 4, has voted to join the Authority, and the\nAuthority has agreed in principle; however, the required ultimate contract\nbetween the two had not been finalized by the time of the trial. Waste collected\nin Stone County by BFI is currently shipped to a landfill in Alabama. As Stone\nCounty has not enacted any flow control ordinance and is not a party to this suit\n(and as none of the here challenged ordinances is applicable to waste collected\nin Stone County), we will not consider the fact that waste from Stone County is\nactually shipped out of state.\n\n                                        15\n\fany   out-of-state     characteristic       of   their   business.15      Thus,\n\nplaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the ordinances on the\n\nbasis of a claim that they are facially discriminatory against out-\n\nof-state interests.16      As such, we express no opinion about whether\n\nthe ordinances would pass the facially discriminatory test if\n\nchallenged by a proper plaintiff.\n\n\n      15\n         We also observe that both BFI and Waste Management have their principal\nplace of business in Mississippi. Nothing in the flow control ordinances turns\non the principal place of business or the place of incorporation or the\ncitizenship of any generator, disposer or handler of waste (or otherwise).\n      16\n         We note that our conclusion that plaintiffs do not meet the prudential\nstanding requirement differs from that in two opinions from our sister circuits.\nSee On the Green Apartments LLC v. City of Tacoma, 241 F.3d 1235 (9th Cir. 2001);\nHoulton Citizens’ Coalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178 (1st Cir. 1999).\nIn On the Green and Houlton, the plaintiffs did not allege that they disposed of\ntheir waste out of state or that they had plans to do so. On the Green, 241 F.3d\nat 1241–40; Houlton, 175 F.3d at 183. Nevertheless, both the Ninth Circuit and\nthe First Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs met the prudential standing\nrequirements.\n      We disagree with the analysis in this aspect of On the Green and Houlton.\nIn On the Green, the Ninth Circuit concluded that because the plaintiff alleged\nonly an intrastate burden, the “Commerce Clause [was] not at all implicated.”\nOn the Green, 241 F.3d at 1242. We fail to see how the plaintiff’s alleged\ninjury could even arguably fall within the zone of interests to be protected by\nthe dormant Commerce Clause when the court concluded that the case did not even\nimplicate the Commerce Clause.     See id. at 1242 (Reavley, J., dissenting).\nFurther, the Ninth Circuit seems to have confused the redressability requirement\nfor constitutional standing with the zone of interests test. The Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that the plaintiff’s injury was “related to the purposes underlying the\nCommerce Clause” because the “injury would be remedied if [the plaintiff] could\ntake its garbage outside the city.” Id. at 1241 (emphasis added). The fact that\nan injury would be remedied if the ordinance was struck down does not mean that\nthe grievance falls within the zone of interests to be protected by the dormant\nCommerce Clause, particularly when there was no allegation of any interstate\nburden.    Under the Ninth Circuit’s rationale in On the Green, the zone of\ninterest test and the redressability requirement would essentially be the same.\n      In Houlton, the First Circuit concluded that the plaintiff met the zone of\ninterests requirement because the plaintiff had “assert[ed] his own economic\ninterests under the Commerce Clause—a constitutional provision specifically\ntargeted to project those interests.” Houlton, 175 F.3d at 183. However, the\nrationale behind the dormant Commerce Clause is to protect against local economic\nprotectionism at the expense of out-of-state interests, Carbone, 114 S.Ct. at\n1682, not to protect any economic interests. In our opinion, the Houlton court\nsimply viewed too broadly the zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce\nClause.\n\n                                       16\n\f                    b.    Burdens Interstate Commerce\n\n      We next consider whether plaintiffs nonetheless have standing\n\nto challenge the flow control ordinances on the basis of the claim\n\nthat they excessively burden interstate commerce. We conclude that\n\nplaintiffs do meet the zone of interests test in this regard and\n\nthus have standing to challenge the ordinances as to their burden\n\non interstate commerce.\n\n      The    protected    against       injury   is   an    excessive      burden       on\n\ninterstate commerce.       An allegation that the plaintiff is involved\n\nin interstate commerce and that the plaintiff’s interstate commerce\n\nis burdened by the ordinance in question is sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe   zone    of    interests    test    with    respect        to   ordinances       that\n\nassertedly impose an excessive burden on interstate commerce.\n\n      Even though plaintiffs do not ship any garbage collected in\n\nthe Region out of state, they are engaged in interstate commerce,\n\nand   their    interstate       commerce    is   allegedly           burdened    by    the\n\nordinances.        A representative of BFI testified at trial that BFI\n\nhad   some    contracts    that    are    negotiated       on    a    national    or    an\n\ninterstate basis and that such contracts were common.                            The BFI\n\nrepresentative testified that an effect on the Mississippi portion\n\nof such a contract would ripple to the portion of the contract in\n\nother states.17       Plaintiffs argue that, because the flow control\n\n\n      17\n          It is not claimed that anything in the contracts requires that any\nwaste collected within the Region be disposed of outside of the Region. Nor do\nthe ordinances make any requirement that any waste collected outside the Region\n(though under a contract also covering waste collected within the Region) be\n\n                                          17\n\fordinances will raise their costs to service these national and\n\nregional contracts which include customer locations within the\n\nRegion, they will be relatively less competitive within the Region\n\nand that this impact on these contracts will extend to the portion\n\nof    the    contracts    covering    customer     locations      outside    of\n\nMississippi.      The ordinances thus allegedly burden plaintiffs’\n\ninterstate commerce.      Plaintiffs therefore are arguably within the\n\nappropriate zone of interests and, therefore, have standing to\n\nchallenge whether the ordinances excessively burden interstate\n\ncommerce.18\n\n      D.     Pike Balancing Test\n\n      We now turn to the Pike balancing test to determine whether\n\nthe   flow    control    ordinances      excessively     burden    interstate\n\ncommerce.19     For this analysis, because plaintiffs do not have\n\nstanding to challenge the ordinances as facially discriminatory\n\n\ndisposed of within the Region.\n      18\n         A Waste Management representative gave testimony similar to that given\nby the BFI representative.      He testified that the parent company, Waste\nManagement, Inc., operated in 48 states and that because of the interrelated\nnature of the business, savings achieved on a transaction in one state would\neventually be shared in another stated. Although the representative did not\ntestify that increased costs in one area would be similarly shared, we assume\narguendo that they would be.\n      In any event, when one of multiple co-parties raising the same claims and\nissues properly has standing, we do not need to verify the independent standing\nof the other co-plaintiffs. See Clinton v. City of New York, 118 S.Ct. 2091,\n2100 n.19 (1998); Bowsher v. Synar, 106 S.Ct. 3181, 3185 (1986). Therefore,\nbecause we find that BFI has standing to challenge whether the flow control\nordinances excessively burden interstate commerce, we need not further analyze\nWaste Management’s independent standing.\n      19\n         Because the magistrate judge alternatively held that the ordinances\nwould not pass even the less rigorous Pike test, we need not remand the case for\nthe court below to consider the Pike test in the first instance.\n\n                                      18\n\fagainst   out-of-state   interests,    we   ignore   the   fact    that   the\n\nordinances would not permit them to ship waste generated within the\n\nRegion out of state.\n\n       An “evenhanded” ordinance, i.e., one that does not facially\n\ndiscriminate against out-of-state interests and only incidentally\n\naffects interstate commerce, will be upheld unless the burden it\n\nimposes on interstate commerce is “clearly excessive in relation to\n\nthe putative local benefits” of the ordinance.         Pike, 90 S.Ct. at\n\n847.   To make this assessment, we consider the nature of the local\n\ninterest and whether alternative means could achieve that interest\n\nwith less impact on interstate commerce:\n\n       “If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the\n       question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the\n       burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on\n       the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether\n       it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on\n       interstate activities.” Id.\n\n       We first look for a legitimate public purpose that defendants\n\nintended to advance by implementing flow control.                 Defendants\n\nindeed have a legitimate local purpose: to ensure the economic\n\nviability of their landfill.      See U & I Sanitation v. City of\n\nColumbus, 205 F.3d 1063, 1070 (8th Cir. 2000) (recognizing economic\n\nviability as a legitimate local purpose in the context of a waste\n\nflow control ordinance).\n\n       Next, we identify the burden imposed on interstate commerce.\n\nTo succeed in a challenge to a regulation under the Pike balancing\n\ntest, the challenging party must show that the regulation has “a\n\n                                  19\n\fdisparate    impact    on   interstate     commerce.”     Automated      Salvage\n\nTransp., Inc. v. Wheelabrator Envtl. Sys., Inc., 155 F.3d 59, 75\n\n(2d Cir. 1998).       The “incidental burdens to which Pike refers are\n\nthe burdens on interstate commerce that exceed the burdens on\n\nintrastate    commerce.”       Id.   (internal      quotation    and     citation\n\nomitted).    “Where a regulation does not have this disparate impact\n\non interstate commerce, then we must conclude that . . . [it] has\n\nnot imposed any incidental burdens on interstate commerce” and,\n\ntherefore, that it passes the Pike test.            Id. (internal quotation\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n     The flow control ordinances here do not have a disparate\n\nimpact on interstate commerce; consequently, plaintiffs fail in\n\ntheir attempt to show that the ordinances do not pass the Pike\n\ntest.   The only evidence of an interstate burden is the effect on\n\nplaintiffs’ interstate contracts: the flow control ordinances,\n\nbecause they will raise plaintiffs’ costs within the Region and\n\nwill make plaintiffs relatively less competitive, impose a burden\n\non plaintiffs’ interstate commerce by affecting the portion of\n\nplaintiffs’    interstate      contracts     that    involve     areas     beyond\n\nMississippi.    The burdens imposed by the ordinances on interstate\n\ncommerce, however, are no greater than those imposed on intrastate\n\ncommerce.       Plaintiffs’      contracts     that     are     wholly    within\n\nMississippi, and even wholly within the Region itself, will also be\n\naffected as plaintiffs’ costs increase within the Region and\n\n\n                                      20\n\fplaintiffs, thereby, become relatively less competitive.                In fact,\n\nthe burden imposed on wholly intrastate contracts, particularly\n\nthose that are contained wholly within the Region, will likely be\n\ngreater than      that    imposed    by   the    flow    control   ordinances   on\n\nplaintiffs’ interstate contracts.              The interstate contracts—which\n\nare presumably larger than plaintiffs’ contracts that are contained\n\nentirely within Mississippi or the Region—will likely be more able\n\nto spread the increased costs over a wider base of business than\n\nwill plaintiffs’ smaller contracts.                 We fail to see how the\n\nordinances   will    in    this     respect     impose   a   greater   burden   on\n\ninterstate commerce than they will on intrastate commerce.\n\n     Moreover, so far as they affect BFI and Waste Management, the\n\nordinances do not inhibit the flow of goods (or waste) interstate.\n\nInt’l Truck & Engine Corp. v. Bray, 372 F.3d 717, 727 (5th Cir.\n\n2004) (“A statute imposes a burden when it inhibits the flow of\n\ngoods interstate.”).        Furthermore, while the ordinances may have\n\nthe effect of shifting some business away from plaintiffs, as the\n\nordinances increase their costs and make them relatively less\n\ncompetitive, this result does not mean that the ordinances burden\n\ninterstate commerce: “[T]he dormant Commerce Clause ‘protects the\n\ninterstate market, not particular interstate firms.’” Id. (quoting\n\nExxon Corp. v. Governor of Md., 98 S.Ct. 2207, 2215 (1978))\n\n(stating   that    the    fact    that    a    regulation    might   cause   truck\n\npurchasers to turn to other competing truck manufacturers did not\n\n\n                                          21\n\fburden interstate commerce).              If plaintiffs lose some of their\n\ninterstate contracts because of their higher costs within the\n\nRegion, the ordinances would not prohibit another garbage collector\n\nfrom entering into a similar interstate contract, whether that\n\ngarbage collector was from Mississippi or some other state.\n\n      Because    plaintiffs        have   not   shown    that     the   ordinances\n\ndisparately     impact   interstate       commerce     relative    to   intrastate\n\ncommerce, their Pike challenge that the ordinances excessively\n\nburden interstate commerce fails.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      Accordingly, (a) we DISMISS for want of standing plaintiffs’\n\nclaim with respect to whether the ordinances facially discriminate\n\nagainst interstate commerce or out-of-state interests, and (b) with\n\nrespect to whether the ordinances otherwise excessively burden\n\ninterstate      commerce,     we     REVERSE     and    RENDER     judgment   for\n\ndefendants.20\n\n\n\n\n      20\n         In his opinion the magistrate judge did not reach any conclusion\nregarding MISSISSIPPI CODE § 17-17-319(2), the law pursuant to which the Authority\ndirected its Members to enact flow control ordinances, the judgment does not\nspeak to § 17-17-319(2) and the parties do not argue that this court need address\nits constitutionality. Moreover, as we hold that as to the particular flow\ncontrol ordinances here the suit must be dismissed for want of standing with\nrespect to whether the ordinances are facially discriminatory against interstate\ncommerce contrary to the dormant Commerce Clause and that those ordinances do not\nviolate the dormant Commerce Clause with respect to whether they otherwise\nexcessively burden interstate commerce compared to their putative local benefits,\nwe need not further address the constitutionality of § 17-17-319.\n\n                                          22\n\f",

(Waste Management) (collectively, plaintiffs),\n\nfiled this suit against defendants-appellants, the Authority and\n\nits member cities and counties, claiming that the flow control\n\nordinances violated the dormant Commerce Clause.                  Defendants-\n\nappellants now timely appeal the judgment, rendered after a bench\n\ntrial, declaring the flow control ordinance invalid under the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause and enjoining their enforcement.                     We\n\ndismiss plaintiffs’ complaint in part for want of standing and with\n\nrespect to     the   remainder    we   reverse   and   render    judgment    for\n\ndefendants–appellants.\n\n                        Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n     In   1989    and   1990,   several    cities   and   counties   in    South\n\nMississippi developed a master plan for the management of the solid\n\nwaste in the region.        The goal of the plan was to develop an\n\nenvironmentally-sensitive        and   cost-effective      program   for     the\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\fdisposal of the region’s solid waste.              Among other things, the\n\nmaster plan recommended the creation of a regional solid waste\n\nmanagement authority and the construction of a regional landfill.\n\nIn 1992, the Authority was formed and the plan was adopted.                   At\n\nthat time, the Authority was made up of five counties (Covington,\n\nJones, Perry, Forrest, and Lamar) and three cities (Petal, Laurel,\n\nand Hattiesburg) in Mississippi (collectively, the Members).                  By\n\nthe time this suit was filed, Forrest and Lamar Counties had\n\nwithdrawn from the Authority.\n\n      In 1992, the Authority issued a request for proposals (RFP) to\n\ninterested parties, including plaintiffs BFI and Waste Management,\n\nregarding the regional landfill.           Proposals were to be given for\n\ntwo options: 1) to own, design, permit, build, and operate the\n\nlandfill for thirty years or 2) to equip and operate the landfill\n\nfor seven     years,   with   the   Authority    building    and   owning    the\n\nlandfill. The RFP included an estimated volume of disposable solid\n\nwaste that would be generated in the geographic area comprised by\n\nthe Members1 and a statement that “[u]pon request, the Authority\n\n\n      1\n        The 1992 RFP estimated the annual volume of disposable waste in the\nRegion to be 153,000 tons. That estimate, however, was derived before Forrest\nand Lamar Counties withdrew from the Authority.        After these two counties\nwithdrew (which was prior to July 2002), the projected volume of waste for the\nAuthority’s Region would have been about 129,000–130,000 tons per year.\n      When creating the master plan and issuing the RFP, the Authority\ncontemplated, at least implicitly, that all solid waste generated within the\nRegion would be disposed of at the landfill that was the subject of the RFP. The\nAuthority’s landfill is, and always has been, the only “Subtitle D” landfill\nwithin the Region. A Subtitle D landfill is one that is compliant with federal\nregulations, issued pursuant to Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and\nRecovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. § 6941, et. seq., setting the criteria for\nsanitary landfills.\n\n                                       3\n\fwill require each [Member] . . . to adopt and enforce a flow\n\ncontrol ordinance in order to assure that the entirety of the . .\n\n. waste stream generated within the [geographic area comprised by\n\nthe Members] will be managed and disposed of at the [Authority’s\n\nlandfill].”    Five proposals were received, including from BFI and\n\nWaste Management.        Enviro, a company headquartered in Laurel,\n\nMississippi, submitted the lowest bid for Option 2, but did not\n\nsubmit a bid for Option 1.            The Authority analyzed the bids,\n\ndecided to own the landfill, and began implementation discussions\n\nwith Enviro prior to actual contract negotiations.\n\n      In 1996, the Authority issued revenue bonds to finance the\n\nconstruction of the landfill and three transfer stations.2             Also in\n\n1996, Enviro signed a contract with the Authority to operate the\n\nAuthority’s landfill,3 located in Perry County and completed in\n\n1997, and transfer stations.        The initial term of the contract was\n\nfor the life of the first landfill cell or seven years, whichever\n\nwas less, and was to be automatically extended for one-year terms\n\nso long as both parties mutually agreed.            In 2000, the Authority\n\nrefinanced the 1996 bonds and issued additional bonds to finance\n\nthe construction of a second cell at the landfill.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n        Waste collecting trucks often unload waste locally at a transfer station\nuntil the waste is transported to a landfill for final disposal.\n      3\n       Enviro provides the labor, management, supplies, equipment, and insurance\nfor the landfill and operates the scales and performs all maintenance at the\nlandfill.\n\n                                       4\n\f      The Authority generates revenue by collecting fees for the\n\ndisposal of waste at its landfill and transfer stations.             Thus the\n\nAuthority’s generation of revenue is based on the amount of garbage\n\nthat it receives at its facilities.               To the extent that the\n\nAuthority is unable to generate sufficient income to meet its debt\n\npayments, the Members are obligated to make up the shortfall.\n\n      From the time the landfill opened, the volume of refuse that\n\npassed through and to the Authority’s facilities was significantly\n\nless than the total amount of potential waste generated in the area\n\ncomprised by its Members.         Although the Authority’s issuance of\n\nbonds was based on a projected volume of 140,000 tons per year, in\n\nfiscal year 1998 the landfill’s volume had reached only 105,305\n\ntons and in fiscal year 1999, the volume dropped to 96,032 tons.\n\nIn 1999, in an attempt to increase its trash collection, and\n\ntherefore    its   revenue   generation,    the   Authority    extended    the\n\nservice area of the landfill to include a total of 22 counties,\n\nwhich allowed the Authority to receive waste at its landfill from\n\nthe additional counties which were not Members.4           While the volume\n\nof trash deposited at the landfill increased with the expanded\n\nservice area, it reached a high of only 129,017 tons in fiscal year\n\n\n      4\n        According to its contract with the Authority, Enviro was obligated to\nbring to the Authority’s landfill all the waste it collected within a 75-mile\nradius of the landfill.      The area comprised by the 22 counties roughly\ncorresponds to this 75-mile radius. The flow control ordinances, however, apply\nonly to the three counties and three cities that are Members of the Authority.\nWhen the Authority first created its plan for the landfill, the service area\nincluded only the five original member counties (Covington, Jones, Perry,\nForrest, and Lamar); the expanded service area added an additional 17 counties.\n\n                                      5\n\f2000, with the tonnage decreasing thereafter (to 108,625 in 2001\n\nand to 95,205 in 2002).\n\n      Due to an insufficient flow of rubbish through and to its\n\nfacilities, the Authority realized that, at the current volume of\n\nwaste, it would not be able to make its July 1, 2004 bond payment.\n\nBelieving that its facilities needed more garbage to remain viable,\n\nthe Authority adopted a resolution on July 10, 2002, directing its\n\nMembers   to   adopt   flow   control       ordinances   requiring    that   all\n\nmunicipal solid waste generated within the then Member counties\n\n(Covington,    Jones   and    Perry)    and    cities    (Petral,   Laurel   and\n\nHattiesburg) respectively [collectively, the Region] be transported\n\nto its landfill or one of its transfer stations.5                   Each Member\n\nenacted identical ordinances, each applicable only within the\n\ngeographic area of the particular enacting Member, with September\n\n1, 2002, as the effective date.6              Each ordinance provided that\n\nnoncompliance therewith would constitute a misdemeanor.\n\n      Following the enactment of the ordinances, plaintiffs on\n\nAugust 29, 2002 filed this suit against the Authority and its\n\nMembers, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief under\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        According to testimony at trial, the amount of trash currently leaving\nthe Region is between 50,000 to 70,0000 tons per year; if this trash were\ndirected to the Authority’s landfill, the tonnage disposed of at the landfill\nwould likely be over 140,000, roughly the amount needed to meet the Authority’s\ndebt obligations.\n      6\n        The flow control ordinances were subsequently reenacted in September,\nOctober, and November of 2002.\n\n                                        6\n\f42 U.S.C. § 1983.7        Plaintiffs BFI and Waste Management collect,\n\nprocess, and dispose of commercial and residential solid waste and\n\ncurrently    ship   the    trash   they     collect    within    the    Region    to\n\nlandfills and transfer stations that they either own and operate or\n\nthat are owned and operated by affiliated companies.                   At the time\n\nof the suit, solid waste collected by BFI and Waste Management\n\nwithin the Region was and had been eventually transported to\n\nlandfills outside of the Region, but within Mississippi; none of\n\nsuch waste was (or had been) transported outside of Mississippi\n\n(nor did any of it originate as waste outside of Mississippi).8\n\nThe flow control ordinances would require that BFI and Waste\n\nManagement dispose of waste they collect within the Region only at\n\nthe Authority’s landfill in Perry County.\n\n      After the filing of the complaint, the parties agreed that the\n\nenforcement of the ordinances would await the outcome of the case.\n\nIn October 2002, the Mississippi State Attorney General intervened\n\non behalf of Mississippi to defend a potential constitutional\n\nchallenge    to   the     Mississippi     statute     pursuant   to     which    the\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        Pine Belt Waste Systems, LLC, also joined with plaintiffs in bringing\nthis suit. Pine Belt Waste, however, was voluntarily dismissed as a plaintiff\non November 25, 2002, prior to trial.\n      8\n        Although the Authority’s landfill is the only Subtitle D landfill within\nthe Region, see supra note 1, the landfills to which BFI and Waste Management\ncurrently haul garbage generated within the Region are Subtitle D landfills. BFI\ncurrently hauls waste collected within the Region to its landfill in Madison\nCounty, Mississippi, and Waste Management hauls its waste to a landfill owned and\noperated by an affiliated company in Scott County, Mississippi.\n\n                                        7\n\fAuthority was authorized to direct its Members to enact the flow\n\ncontrol ordinances.       See MISS. CODE. ANN. § 17-17-319(2).\n\n      Trial was held in December 2002 before the district judge\n\nwithout a jury.        After the trial, but before a decision was\n\nrendered, Perry County filed a motion to dismiss for lack of\n\njurisdiction based on the “adequate state grounds” doctrine.                Also\n\nfollowing the trial, the district judge recused himself on his own\n\nmotion, and the matter was subsequently properly assigned, with\n\nconsent of the parties, to a magistrate judge for decision.                   On\n\nApril 23, 2003, the magistrate judge denied the motion to dismiss\n\nand   issued   findings    of   fact   and   conclusions     of   law   and   an\n\naccompanying      judgment,     deciding     that    the    ordinances      were\n\nunconstitutional under the dormant Commerce Clause and enjoining\n\ntheir enforcement.9      Defendants on May 22, 2003, timely filed their\n\nnotice of appeal.\n\n                                  Discussion\n\n      Defendants contend that the flow control ordinances do not\n\nviolate the dormant Commerce Clause.10              We dismiss the dormant\n\n\n      9\n        No damages were awarded. While the judgment purports to generally award\n“attorneys fees,” no amount thereof is stated in the judgment (or in the findings\nand conclusions) and we are informed by the parties that plaintiffs have in\nsubstance waived attorneys fees under this judgment by failing to file any\nevidence of the amount of attorneys fees or any motion in connection therewith\nas contemplated in FED. R. CIV. P. 54(d)92) and the local rules.\n      10\n          Defendants also contend that the district court lacked jurisdiction\nbecause plaintiffs did not appeal the Member counties’ and cities’ adoption of\nthe ordinances to a state circuit court as authorized by Miss. Code Ann. 11-51-\n75. See Benedict v.

In other words, we ask whether the\n\nordinances    “reflect[]     a    discriminatory      purpose     or   merely    a\n\ndiscriminatory effect.”          Id.   “Although . . . there is no clear\n\nline   of   separation    between      these   two”   classifications,       “the\n\nthreshold    determination       is    significant    if   only    because      it\n\nestablishes the constitutional standard of review.”               Id.

Our standing analysis\n\nconsists of constitutional and prudential components.\n\n            1.    Constitutional Standing\n\n      “To meet the constitutional standing requirement, a plaintiff\n\nmust show (1) an injury in fact (2) that is fairly traceable to the\n\nactions of the defendant and (3) that likely will be redressed by\n\na favorable decision.”        Procter & Gamble Co. v.

Because of the flow control ordinances, plaintiffs\n\nwill not be able to ship the garbage they collect within the Region\n\nto the landfills of their choice and, as a result, will be forced\n\nto pay a “tipping”12 fee at the Authority’s landfill.             Testimony at\n\ntrial indicates that plaintiffs’ cost to dispose of waste at the\n\nAuthority’s      landfill,    including      the   tipping     fee    and    the\n\ntransportation cost, would be higher than their current cost.13\n\n\n      12\n         In garbage parlance, “tipping” is used in place of the less-refined\n“dumping.”\n      13\n         In addition to a simple comparison of current costs against the costs\nunder the flow control ordinances, other testimony supports plaintiffs’ claim of\nhigher costs.      The ordinances preclude plaintiffs from operating an\n“internalized” business—meaning that they collect, transport, and dispose of the\nwaste using their own facilities. Testimony at trial suggests that such a method\nof operation achieves the best economy of scale for a waste collector. Further,\nBFI and Waste Management would face a reduced volume of waste at the transfer\nstations to which they currently haul waste from the Region, because they most\nlikely cannot economically segregate at the transfer station the waste that comes\nfrom within the Region from that which comes from outside the Region. The result\n\n                                       12\n\fThus, plaintiffs have an injury (higher operating costs) that is\n\ntraceable to the ordinances enacted by defendants and which would\n\nbe remedied if we rule that the ordinances are unconstitutional.\n\n           2.    Prudential Standing\n\n     The more difficult question is whether plaintiffs meet the\n\nprudential standing requirements.           The goal of the prudential\n\nstanding requirements is to “determine whether the plaintiff ‘is a\n\nproper party to invoke judicial resolution of the dispute and the\n\nexercise of the court’s remedial powers.’”          Procter & Gamble, 242\n\nF.3d at 560 (quoting Bender v.

The flow\n\ncontrol ordinances mandate that any waste generated within the\n\nRegion be transported to the Authority’s landfill or transfer\n\nstations.        In effect, the ordinances prohibit the export of any\n\nwaste outside of the Region, including out of state.                   However,\n\nthese plaintiffs do not ship (and, so far as the record shows, have\n\nnever shipped) any waste they collect within the Region to any\n\nlocation outside of Mississippi, nor do they ship (and, so far as\n\nthe record shows, have never shipped) any waste from outside of\n\nMississippi to the Region.         Plaintiffs also have not even alleged\n\nthat they have any plans to do so,14 and have not suggested that\n\nsome other party currently ships waste from the Region outside of\n\nMississippi, or has plans to do so, or that any out-of-state waste\n\nprocessor receives (or has plans to receive) any of the Region’s\n\nwaste out of state.         In sum, plaintiffs’ injury is not related to\n\n       14\n        Stone County, a Mississippi county that is now within the Authority’s\nexpanded service area, see supra note 4, has voted to join the Authority, and the\nAuthority has agreed in principle; however, the required ultimate contract\nbetween the two had not been finalized by the time of the trial. Waste collected\nin Stone County by BFI is currently shipped to a landfill in Alabama. As Stone\nCounty has not enacted any flow control ordinance and is not a party to this suit\n(and as none of the here challenged ordinances is applicable to waste collected\nin Stone County), we will not consider the fact that waste from Stone County is\nactually shipped out of state.\n\n                                        15\n\fany   out-of-state     characteristic       of   their   business.15      Thus,\n\nplaintiffs do not have standing to challenge the ordinances on the\n\nbasis of a claim that they are facially discriminatory against out-\n\nof-state interests.16      As such, we express no opinion about whether\n\nthe ordinances would pass the facially discriminatory test if\n\nchallenged by a proper plaintiff.\n\n\n      15\n         We also observe that both BFI and Waste Management have their principal\nplace of business in Mississippi. Nothing in the flow control ordinances turns\non the principal place of business or the place of incorporation or the\ncitizenship of any generator, disposer or handler of waste (or otherwise).\n      16\n         We note that our conclusion that plaintiffs do not meet the prudential\nstanding requirement differs from that in two opinions from our sister circuits.\nSee On the Green Apartments LLC v.

On the Green, 241 F.3d\nat 1241–40; Houlton, 175 F.3d at 183. Nevertheless, both the Ninth Circuit and\nthe First Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs met the prudential standing\nrequirements.\n      We disagree with the analysis in this aspect of On the Green and Houlton.\nIn On the Green, the Ninth Circuit concluded that because the plaintiff alleged\nonly an intrastate burden, the “Commerce Clause [was] not at all implicated.”\nOn the Green, 241 F.3d at 1242. We fail to see how the plaintiff’s alleged\ninjury could even arguably fall within the zone of interests to be protected by\nthe dormant Commerce Clause when the court concluded that the case did not even\nimplicate the Commerce Clause.     See id. at 1242 (Reavley, J., dissenting).\nFurther, the Ninth Circuit seems to have confused the redressability requirement\nfor constitutional standing with the zone of interests test. The Ninth Circuit\nconcluded that the plaintiff’s injury was “related to the purposes underlying the\nCommerce Clause” because the “injury would be remedied if [the plaintiff] could\ntake its garbage outside the city.” Id. at 1241 (emphasis added). The fact that\nan injury would be remedied if the ordinance was struck down does not mean that\nthe grievance falls within the zone of interests to be protected by the dormant\nCommerce Clause, particularly when there was no allegation of any interstate\nburden.    Under the Ninth Circuit’s rationale in On the Green, the zone of\ninterest test and the redressability requirement would essentially be the same.\n      In Houlton, the First Circuit concluded that the plaintiff met the zone of\ninterests requirement because the plaintiff had “assert[ed] his own economic\ninterests under the Commerce Clause—a constitutional provision specifically\ntargeted to project those interests.” Houlton, 175 F.3d at 183. However, the\nrationale behind the dormant Commerce Clause is to protect against local economic\nprotectionism at the expense of out-of-state interests, Carbone, 114 S.Ct. at\n1682, not to protect any economic interests. In our opinion, the Houlton court\nsimply viewed too broadly the zone of interests protected by the dormant Commerce\nClause.\n\n                                       16\n\f                    b.    Burdens Interstate Commerce\n\n      We next consider whether plaintiffs nonetheless have standing\n\nto challenge the flow control ordinances on the basis of the claim\n\nthat they excessively burden interstate commerce. We conclude that\n\nplaintiffs do meet the zone of interests test in this regard and\n\nthus have standing to challenge the ordinances as to their burden\n\non interstate commerce.\n\n      The    protected    against       injury   is   an    excessive      burden       on\n\ninterstate commerce.       An allegation that the plaintiff is involved\n\nin interstate commerce and that the plaintiff’s interstate commerce\n\nis burdened by the ordinance in question is sufficient to satisfy\n\nthe   zone    of    interests    test    with    respect        to   ordinances       that\n\nassertedly impose an excessive burden on interstate commerce.\n\n      Even though plaintiffs do not ship any garbage collected in\n\nthe Region out of state, they are engaged in interstate commerce,\n\nand   their    interstate       commerce    is   allegedly           burdened    by    the\n\nordinances.        A representative of BFI testified at trial that BFI\n\nhad   some    contracts    that    are    negotiated       on    a    national    or    an\n\ninterstate basis and that such contracts were common.                            The BFI\n\nrepresentative testified that an effect on the Mississippi portion\n\nof such a contract would ripple to the portion of the contract in\n\nother states.17       Plaintiffs argue that, because the flow control\n\n\n      17\n          It is not claimed that anything in the contracts requires that any\nwaste collected within the Region be disposed of outside of the Region. Nor do\nthe ordinances make any requirement that any waste collected outside the Region\n(though under a contract also covering waste collected within the Region) be\n\n                                          17\n\fordinances will raise their costs to service these national and\n\nregional contracts which include customer locations within the\n\nRegion, they will be relatively less competitive within the Region\n\nand that this impact on these contracts will extend to the portion\n\nof    the    contracts    covering    customer     locations      outside    of\n\nMississippi.      The ordinances thus allegedly burden plaintiffs’\n\ninterstate commerce.      Plaintiffs therefore are arguably within the\n\nappropriate zone of interests and, therefore, have standing to\n\nchallenge whether the ordinances excessively burden interstate\n\ncommerce.18\n\n      D.     Pike Balancing Test\n\n      We now turn to the Pike balancing test to determine whether\n\nthe   flow    control    ordinances      excessively     burden    interstate\n\ncommerce.19     For this analysis, because plaintiffs do not have\n\nstanding to challenge the ordinances as facially discriminatory\n\n\ndisposed of within the Region.\n      18\n         A Waste Management representative gave testimony similar to that given\nby the BFI representative.      He testified that the parent company, Waste\nManagement, Inc., operated in 48 states and that because of the interrelated\nnature of the business, savings achieved on a transaction in one state would\neventually be shared in another stated. Although the representative did not\ntestify that increased costs in one area would be similarly shared, we assume\narguendo that they would be.\n      In any event, when one of multiple co-parties raising the same claims and\nissues properly has standing, we do not need to verify the independent standing\nof the other co-plaintiffs.

City of New York, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118238\"><a href=\"/opinion/118238/clinton-v-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Therefore,\nbecause we find that BFI has standing to challenge whether the flow control\nordinances excessively burden interstate commerce, we need not further analyze\nWaste Management’s independent standing.\n      19\n         Because the magistrate judge alternatively held that the ordinances\nwould not pass even the less rigorous Pike test, we need not remand the case for\nthe court below to consider the Pike test in the first instance.\n\n                                      18\n\fagainst   out-of-state   interests,    we   ignore   the   fact    that   the\n\nordinances would not permit them to ship waste generated within the\n\nRegion out of state.\n\n       An “evenhanded” ordinance, i.e., one that does not facially\n\ndiscriminate against out-of-state interests and only incidentally\n\naffects interstate commerce, will be upheld unless the burden it\n\nimposes on interstate commerce is “clearly excessive in relation to\n\nthe putative local benefits” of the ordinance.         Pike, 90 S.Ct. at\n\n847.   To make this assessment, we consider the nature of the local\n\ninterest and whether alternative means could achieve that interest\n\nwith less impact on interstate commerce:\n\n       “If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the\n       question becomes one of degree. And the extent of the\n       burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on\n       the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether\n       it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on\n       interstate activities.” Id.\n\n       We first look for a legitimate public purpose that defendants\n\nintended to advance by implementing flow control.                 Defendants\n\nindeed have a legitimate local purpose: to ensure the economic\n\nviability of their landfill.      See U & I Sanitation v.

The “incidental burdens to which Pike refers are\n\nthe burdens on interstate commerce that exceed the burdens on\n\nintrastate    commerce.”       Id.   (internal      quotation    and     citation\n\nomitted).    “Where a regulation does not have this disparate impact\n\non interstate commerce, then we must conclude that . . . [it] has\n\nnot imposed any incidental burdens on interstate commerce” and,\n\ntherefore, that it passes the Pike test.            Id. (internal quotation\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n     The flow control ordinances here do not have a disparate\n\nimpact on interstate commerce; consequently, plaintiffs fail in\n\ntheir attempt to show that the ordinances do not pass the Pike\n\ntest.   The only evidence of an interstate burden is the effect on\n\nplaintiffs’ interstate contracts: the flow control ordinances,\n\nbecause they will raise plaintiffs’ costs within the Region and\n\nwill make plaintiffs relatively less competitive, impose a burden\n\non plaintiffs’ interstate commerce by affecting the portion of\n\nplaintiffs’    interstate      contracts     that    involve     areas     beyond\n\nMississippi.    The burdens imposed by the ordinances on interstate\n\ncommerce, however, are no greater than those imposed on intrastate\n\ncommerce.       Plaintiffs’      contracts     that     are     wholly    within\n\nMississippi, and even wholly within the Region itself, will also be\n\naffected as plaintiffs’ costs increase within the Region and\n\n\n                                      20\n\fplaintiffs, thereby, become relatively less competitive.                In fact,\n\nthe burden imposed on wholly intrastate contracts, particularly\n\nthose that are contained wholly within the Region, will likely be\n\ngreater than      that    imposed    by   the    flow    control   ordinances   on\n\nplaintiffs’ interstate contracts.              The interstate contracts—which\n\nare presumably larger than plaintiffs’ contracts that are contained\n\nentirely within Mississippi or the Region—will likely be more able\n\nto spread the increased costs over a wider base of business than\n\nwill plaintiffs’ smaller contracts.                 We fail to see how the\n\nordinances   will    in    this     respect     impose   a   greater   burden   on\n\ninterstate commerce than they will on intrastate commerce.\n\n     Moreover, so far as they affect BFI and Waste Management, the\n\nordinances do not inhibit the flow of goods (or waste) interstate.\n\nInt’l Truck & Engine Corp. v.

Governor of Md., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109896\"><a href=\"/opinion/109896/exxon-corp-v-governor-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2207</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2215 (1978))\n\n(stating   that    the    fact    that    a    regulation    might   cause   truck\n\npurchasers to turn to other competing truck manufacturers did not\n\n\n                                          21\n\fburden interstate commerce).              If plaintiffs lose some of their\n\ninterstate contracts because of their higher costs within the\n\nRegion, the ordinances would not prohibit another garbage collector\n\nfrom entering into a similar interstate contract, whether that\n\ngarbage collector was from Mississippi or some other state.\n\n      Because    plaintiffs        have   not   shown    that     the   ordinances\n\ndisparately     impact   interstate       commerce     relative    to   intrastate\n\ncommerce, their Pike challenge that the ordinances excessively\n\nburden interstate commerce fails.\n\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      Accordingly, (a) we DISMISS for want of standing plaintiffs’\n\nclaim with respect to whether the ordinances facially discriminate\n\nagainst interstate commerce or out-of-state interests, and (b) with\n\nrespect to whether the ordinances otherwise excessively burden\n\ninterstate      commerce,     we     REVERSE     and    RENDER     judgment   for\n\ndefendants.20\n\n\n\n\n      20\n         In his opinion the magistrate judge did not reach any conclusion\nregarding MISSISSIPPI CODE § 17-17-319(2), the law pursuant to which the Authority\ndirected its Members to enact flow control ordinances, the judgment does not\nspeak to § 17-17-319(2) and the parties do not argue that this court need address\nits constitutionality. Moreover, as we hold that as to the particular flow\ncontrol ordinances here the suit must be dismissed for want of standing with\nrespect to whether the ordinances are facially discriminatory against interstate\ncommerce contrary to the dormant Commerce Clause and that those ordinances do not\nviolate the dormant Commerce Clause with respect to whether they otherwise\nexcessively burden interstate commerce compared to their putative local benefits,\nwe need not further address the constitutionality of § 17-17-319.\n\n                                          22\n\f</pre>",
