See Serton v. Serton, 819 So. 2d 15 (Miss. Ct.\n\nApp. 2002).    In his amended complaint, Serton named as\n\ndefendants: Billy Sollie, the Sheriff of Lauderdale County,\n\n\n     *\n       Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that\nthis opinion should not be published and is not precedent except\nunder the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f                             No. 02-61010\n                                  -2-\n\nMississippi; Doris Callahan, Jail Administrator; Sarah P.\n\nSpringer, chancellor of the Twelfth Chancery Court; the\n\nLauderdale County Board of Supervisors (“Board of Supervisors”);\n\nattorney Lawrence Primeaux; and attorney William Jacob.      The\n\ndistrict court dismissed the claims against Chancellor Springer\n\nand granted motions for summary judgment by the remaining\n\nparties.\n\n     Serton contends that the district court erred in holding\n\nthat Chancellor Springer was entitled to judicial immunity and in\n\ngranting her motion to dismiss.    We review the district court’s\n\ndismissal under FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a\n\nclaim de novo.     Brown v. NationsBank Corp., 188 F.3d 579, 585\n\n(5th Cir. 1999).    Judicial officers are entitled to absolute\n\nimmunity from claims arising out of acts performed in the\n\nexercise of their judicial functions.       Graves v. Hampton, 1 F.3d\n\n315, 317 (5th Cir. 1993).    Judicial immunity may be overcome only\n\nby showing that the actions complained of were nonjudicial in\n\nnature or were taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.\n\nMireless v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9, 11-12 (1991).      Serton has failed to\n\nmake such a showing.     See Malina v. Gonzales, 994 F.2d 1121,\n\n1124–25 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n     Serton contends that the district court erred in granting\n\nthe motions for summary judgment filed by attorneys Primeaux and\n\nJacob, Sheriff Sollie, and Jail Administrator Callahan.      Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, depositions, answers\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -3-\n\nto interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.”   FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c); see Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).     “If the moving party meets\n\nthe initial burden of showing there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to\n\nproduce evidence or designate specific facts showing the\n\nexistence of a genuine issue for trial.”     Allen v. Rapides Parish\n\nSch. Bd., 204 F.3d 619, 621 (5th Cir. 2000) (internal quotations\n\nand citation omitted).\n\n      Defendant Primeaux represented Serton in the divorce action\n\nprior to being permitted to withdraw.     See Serton, 819 So. 2d at\n\n17.   Characterizing Serton’s claim against Primeaux as a legal-\n\nmalpractice action, the district court held that Serton’s claims\n\nagainst Primeaux are time-barred under state law.    Serton\n\ncontends that the limitation period should be equitably tolled\n\nbecause he suffered from a mental deficiency.    Under state law,\n\nlimitation periods are tolled during periods in which the\n\nclaimant is disabled by “infancy or unsoundness of mind.”     MISS.\n\nCODE ANN. § 15-1-59 (West 2003).   “The test as to whether the\n\nclaimant is so mentally incompetent as to toll the running of the\n\nstatute of limitations, is this:    Is his mind so unsound, or is\n\nhe so weak in mind, or so imbecile, no matter from what cause,\n\nthat he cannot manage the ordinary affairs of life?”     USF&G Co.\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -4-\n\nv. Conservatorship of Melson, 809 So. 2d 647, 653 (Miss. 2002)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).   Serton stated in his\n\naffidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that\n\nhe became suicidal and “mentally incompetent” on June 13, 2000.\n\nThat one is suicidal does not establish that his mind is so\n\nunsound that he is unable to manage his ordinary affairs.\n\nSerton’s unsupported assertion regarding his mental competency is\n\nnot sufficient to show that there was a genuine issue of material\n\nfact with respect to his soundness of mind.\n\n     In granting the motion for summary judgment of attorney\n\nJacob, who represented Serton’s wife in the divorce proceeding,\n\nthe district court held that Serton had failed to show that\n\nJacob’s alleged statutory and constitutional violations were the\n\nproximate cause of Serton’s incarceration for contempt of court.\n\nSerton contends on appeal that Jacob’s failure to serve him\n\nproperly with notice of a September 7, 1999, contempt hearing\n\nprevented him from proving to the trial court his inability to\n\npay the child support arrearages and that Jacob obtained the\n\njudgment of divorce fraudulently by causing him to be\n\nincarcerated.   Serton contends that Jacob violated his right to\n\ndue process by obtaining his incarceration in order to obtain an\n\nunfair advantage in the divorce proceeding.\n\n     In its opinion and judgment, dated April 21, 1998, the state\n\ncourt found Serton in contempt, but suspended incarceration on\n\nthe condition that he purge himself from contempt.   Serton’s\n\f                            No. 02-61010\n                                 -5-\n\nfailure to comply with the court’s orders resulted in his\n\nincarceration for contempt on September 7, 1999.      Jacob stated in\n\nhis affidavit filed in support of the motion for summary judgment\n\nthat Serton was notified by mail of the hearing.      Serton did not\n\nstate in his affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary\n\njudgment that he did not know that the matter had been set for\n\nhearing.    There is no genuine issue whether Jacob’s failure to\n\npersonally serve Serton with process was the proximate cause of\n\nhis incarceration.\n\n       Moreover, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a private right of\n\naction for persons who have been deprived of a right secured\n\nunder the Constitution by a person acting under color of state\n\nlaw.    Serton contends that Jacob acted as a state actor “when he\n\ninvoked the enforcement of the purported ‘Temporary Agreed\n\nJudgment’ without service of any summons . . . .”      This argument\n\nis without merit.    “[P]rivate attorneys, even court-appointed\n\nattorneys, are not official state actors, and generally are not\n\nsubject to suit under section 1983.”    See Mills v. Criminal Dist.\n\nCourt No. 3, 837 F.2d 677, 678 (5th Cir. 1988).      Private\n\nattorneys may, however, be liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if they\n\nconspire with governmental officials.      See id.   Serton does not\n\nargue on appeal that Jacob conspired with a government official.\n\n       Underlying Serton’s various claims against Sheriff Sollie\n\nand Jail Administrator Callahan is the question whether Serton’s\n\nstatus as a person incarcerated for civil contempt affects the\n\f                            No. 02-61010\n                                 -6-\n\nanalysis of his constitutional claims.     We assume without\n\ndeciding that Serton’s claims should be analyzed in light of the\n\nstandards applicable to claims asserted by pre-trial detainees.\n\n     The standard applied in analyzing constitutional challenges\n\nby pretrial detainees hinges upon the classification of the\n\nchallenge as an attack on a condition of confinement or as an\n\nepisodic act or omission.   Hare v. City of Corinth, 74 F.3d 633,\n\n644 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).    Conditions of confinement claims\n\nare analyzed under the reasonable-relationship test of Bell v.\n\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979).    Under this standard, a\n\nconstitutional violation exists only if it is determined that the\n\ncomplained-of condition is not reasonably related to a\n\nlegitimate, non-punitive governmental objective.     See Hare, 74\n\nF.3d at 640.   When the complained-of harm involves an episodic\n\nact or omission, the claimant must show that the individual\n\ndefendant acted with subjective deliberate indifference to the\n\ndetainee’s constitutional rights.    See id. at 649 n.4.\n\n     Serton’s main complaint on appeal is that he was housed in\n\nadministrative segregation on 23-hour lockdown from May 9, 2000,\n\nto October 18, 2000, without predeprivation notice and hearing.\n\nSee Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-66 (1974).      In\n\nconsidering whether a condition of confinement resulted in the\n\ndeprivation of liberty without due process of law, the inquiry\n\nfocuses on whether the condition or restriction was punitive\n\nbecause the State may not punish pretrial detainees.       Bell, 441\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -7-\n\nU.S. at 535.   The fact that “detention interferes with the\n\ndetainee’s understandable desire to live as comfortably as\n\npossible” does not equate to punishment.   Id. at 537.    However,\n\nan arbitrary or purposeless restriction on a pretrial detainee\n\nleads to the inference that the restriction is punitive.      See\n\nOlgin v. Darnell, 664 F.2d 107, 109 (5th Cir. 1981).     “[T]he\n\neffective management of the detention facility once the\n\nindividual is confined is a valid objective that may justify\n\nimposition of conditions and restrictions of pretrial detention\n\nand dispel any inferences that such restrictions are intended as\n\npunishment.”   Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 540).\n\n     The summary judgment evidence reflects that Serton’s\n\nplacement in 23-hour lockdown was for his own protection and for\n\nthe protection of other inmates and was not punishment for a\n\ndisciplinary violation.   Serton’s conclusional statements and\n\nsuppositions in his affidavit are not sufficient to show that\n\nthere is a genuine issue whether the lockdown was punitive.       Nor\n\nhas Serton shown that there is a genuine issue whether Sheriff\n\nSollie and Jail Administrator Callahan acted with subjective\n\ndeliberate indifference to Serton’s right to due process.\n\nSee Hare, 74 F.3d at 649 n.4.\n\n     For the same reasons, Serton cannot show that Sheriff Sollie\n\nand Jail Administrator Callahan acted with subjective deliberate\n\nindifference by taking his walking cane away.   The summary\n\njudgment evidence shows that the cane was taken because Serton\n\f                            No. 02-61010\n                                 -8-\n\nused it to threaten other inmates.   On appeal, Serton contends\n\nonly that the reasons for taking the cane away were insufficient\n\nand that his cane was taken away because he was accused falsely\n\nby other inmates of threatening behavior.\n\n     This claim implicates the adequacy of the medical care\n\nprovided in the jail.   “[T]here is no significant distinction\n\nbetween pretrial detainees and convicted inmates concerning basic\n\nhuman needs such as medical care.”    Gibbs v. Grimmette, 254 F.3d\n\n545, 548 (5th Cir. 2001).   To establish liability, a pretrial\n\ndetainee must “show that a state official acted with deliberate\n\nindifference to a substantial risk of serious medical harm and\n\nthat injuries resulted.”    Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., 227 F.3d 316,\n\n324 (5th Cir. 2000); see Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104\n\n(1976).   “‘Deliberate indifference’ requires that the official\n\nhave subjective knowledge of the risk of harm.”    Wagner, 227 F.3d\n\nat 324.\n\n     Serton contends that he had a medical prescription for the\n\ncane prior to his incarceration and that he told the jail medical\n\nstaff of this fact on his arrival at the jail.    This fact, if\n\ntrue, does not show that Sheriff Sollie and Jail Administrator\n\nCallahan were subjectively aware of this fact or that they acted\n\nwith deliberate indifference to Serton’s need for a cane.     See\n\nThompkins v. Belt, 828 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir. 1987)\n\n(“[S]upervisory officials are not liable for the actions of\n\nsubordinates on any theory of vicarious liability.”).\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -9-\n\n     Serton complains that he became depressed and suicidal while\n\nin lockdown and that Sheriff Sollie and Jail Administrator\n\nCallahan acted with deliberate indifference to his mental\n\ncondition.   The record reflects that, after Serton threatened to\n\ncommit suicide, he was placed on suicide watch until he could be\n\nseen by a counselor.   Serton argues only that Sheriff Sollie and\n\nJail Administrator Callahan caused his depression by putting him\n\nin lockdown, by taking his cane away, and by making him\n\nuncomfortable.   These allegations do not show that the defendants\n\nacted with deliberate indifference to his mental condition.\n\n     Serton contends that he became diabetic as a result of the\n\nstress of incarceration and that he was not provided with\n\nimmediate treatment.   These allegations do not show that the\n\ndefendants acted with deliberate indifference to a serious\n\nmedical condition.   The record reflects that Serton’s diabetes\n\nwas treated.\n\n     Serton has raised no issue with respect to the granting of\n\nsummary judgment for the Board of Supervisors or with respect to\n\nhis Fourth Amendment, denial-of-access-to-courts, and state-law\n\ntort claims.   Accordingly, those claims are abandoned.   See Yohey\n\nv. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n     The judgment is AFFIRMED.\n\f",

See Serton, 819 So. 2d at\n\n17.   Characterizing Serton’s claim against Primeaux as a legal-\n\nmalpractice action, the district court held that Serton’s claims\n\nagainst Primeaux are time-barred under state law.    Serton\n\ncontends that the limitation period should be equitably tolled\n\nbecause he suffered from a mental deficiency.    Under state law,\n\nlimitation periods are tolled during periods in which the\n\nclaimant is disabled by “infancy or unsoundness of mind.”     MISS.\n\nCODE ANN. § 15-1-59 (West 2003).   “The test as to whether the\n\nclaimant is so mentally incompetent as to toll the running of the\n\nstatute of limitations, is this:    Is his mind so unsound, or is\n\nhe so weak in mind, or so imbecile, no matter from what cause,\n\nthat he cannot manage the ordinary affairs of life?”     USF&G Co.\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -4-\n\nv.

Serton stated in his\n\naffidavit in opposition to the motion for summary judgment that\n\nhe became suicidal and “mentally incompetent” on June 13, 2000.\n\nThat one is suicidal does not establish that his mind is so\n\nunsound that he is unable to manage his ordinary affairs.\n\nSerton’s unsupported assertion regarding his mental competency is\n\nnot sufficient to show that there was a genuine issue of material\n\nfact with respect to his soundness of mind.\n\n     In granting the motion for summary judgment of attorney\n\nJacob, who represented Serton’s wife in the divorce proceeding,\n\nthe district court held that Serton had failed to show that\n\nJacob’s alleged statutory and constitutional violations were the\n\nproximate cause of Serton’s incarceration for contempt of court.\n\nSerton contends on appeal that Jacob’s failure to serve him\n\nproperly with notice of a September 7, 1999, contempt hearing\n\nprevented him from proving to the trial court his inability to\n\npay the child support arrearages and that Jacob obtained the\n\njudgment of divorce fraudulently by causing him to be\n\nincarcerated.   Serton contends that Jacob violated his right to\n\ndue process by obtaining his incarceration in order to obtain an\n\nunfair advantage in the divorce proceeding.\n\n     In its opinion and judgment, dated April 21, 1998, the state\n\ncourt found Serton in contempt, but suspended incarceration on\n\nthe condition that he purge himself from contempt.   Serton’s\n\f                            No. 02-61010\n                                 -5-\n\nfailure to comply with the court’s orders resulted in his\n\nincarceration for contempt on September 7, 1999.      Jacob stated in\n\nhis affidavit filed in support of the motion for summary judgment\n\nthat Serton was notified by mail of the hearing.      Serton did not\n\nstate in his affidavit in opposition to the motion for summary\n\njudgment that he did not know that the matter had been set for\n\nhearing.    There is no genuine issue whether Jacob’s failure to\n\npersonally serve Serton with process was the proximate cause of\n\nhis incarceration.\n\n       Moreover, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 provides a private right of\n\naction for persons who have been deprived of a right secured\n\nunder the Constitution by a person acting under color of state\n\nlaw.    Serton contends that Jacob acted as a state actor “when he\n\ninvoked the enforcement of the purported ‘Temporary Agreed\n\nJudgment’ without service of any summons . . . .”      This argument\n\nis without merit.    “[P]rivate attorneys, even court-appointed\n\nattorneys, are not official state actors, and generally are not\n\nsubject to suit under section 1983.”    See Mills v. Criminal Dist.\n\nCourt No. 3, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500370\"><a href=\"/opinion/500370/fred-douglas-mills-v-criminal-district-court-3-hon-gary-stephens-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 678 (5th Cir. 1988).      Private\n\nattorneys may, however, be liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 if they\n\nconspire with governmental officials.      See id.   Serton does not\n\nargue on appeal that Jacob conspired with a government official.\n\n       Underlying Serton’s various claims against Sheriff Sollie\n\nand Jail Administrator Callahan is the question whether Serton’s\n\nstatus as a person incarcerated for civil contempt affects the\n\f                            No. 02-61010\n                                 -6-\n\nanalysis of his constitutional claims.     We assume without\n\ndeciding that Serton’s claims should be analyzed in light of the\n\nstandards applicable to claims asserted by pre-trial detainees.\n\n     The standard applied in analyzing constitutional challenges\n\nby pretrial detainees hinges upon the classification of the\n\nchallenge as an attack on a condition of confinement or as an\n\nepisodic act or omission.   Hare v. City of Corinth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8399\"><a href=\"/opinion/8399/hare-v-city-of-corinth-miss/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">633</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n644 (5th Cir. 1996) (en banc).    Conditions of confinement claims\n\nare analyzed under the reasonable-relationship test of Bell v.\n\nWolfish, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979).    Under this standard, a\n\nconstitutional violation exists only if it is determined that the\n\ncomplained-of condition is not reasonably related to a\n\nlegitimate, non-punitive governmental objective.     See Hare, 74\n\nF.3d at 640.   When the complained-of harm involves an episodic\n\nact or omission, the claimant must show that the individual\n\ndefendant acted with subjective deliberate indifference to the\n\ndetainee’s constitutional rights.    See id. at 649 n.4.\n\n     Serton’s main complaint on appeal is that he was housed in\n\nadministrative segregation on 23-hour lockdown from May 9, 2000,\n\nto October 18, 2000, without predeprivation notice and hearing.\n\nSee Wolff v. McDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 563-66 (1974).      In\n\nconsidering whether a condition of confinement resulted in the\n\ndeprivation of liberty without due process of law, the inquiry\n\nfocuses on whether the condition or restriction was punitive\n\nbecause the State may not punish pretrial detainees.       Bell, 441\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -7-\n\nU.S. at 535.   The fact that “detention interferes with the\n\ndetainee’s understandable desire to live as comfortably as\n\npossible” does not equate to punishment.   Id. at 537.    However,\n\nan arbitrary or purposeless restriction on a pretrial detainee\n\nleads to the inference that the restriction is punitive.      See\n\nOlgin v. Darnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396928\"><a href=\"/opinion/396928/steve-olgin-jr-v-ed-darnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (5th Cir. 1981).     “[T]he\n\neffective management of the detention facility once the\n\nindividual is confined is a valid objective that may justify\n\nimposition of conditions and restrictions of pretrial detention\n\nand dispel any inferences that such restrictions are intended as\n\npunishment.”   Id. (quoting Bell, 441 U.S. at 540).\n\n     The summary judgment evidence reflects that Serton’s\n\nplacement in 23-hour lockdown was for his own protection and for\n\nthe protection of other inmates and was not punishment for a\n\ndisciplinary violation.   Serton’s conclusional statements and\n\nsuppositions in his affidavit are not sufficient to show that\n\nthere is a genuine issue whether the lockdown was punitive.       Nor\n\nhas Serton shown that there is a genuine issue whether Sheriff\n\nSollie and Jail Administrator Callahan acted with subjective\n\ndeliberate indifference to Serton’s right to due process.\n\nSee Hare, 74 F.3d at 649 n.4.\n\n     For the same reasons, Serton cannot show that Sheriff Sollie\n\nand Jail Administrator Callahan acted with subjective deliberate\n\nindifference by taking his walking cane away.   The summary\n\njudgment evidence shows that the cane was taken because Serton\n\f                            No. 02-61010\n                                 -8-\n\nused it to threaten other inmates.   On appeal, Serton contends\n\nonly that the reasons for taking the cane away were insufficient\n\nand that his cane was taken away because he was accused falsely\n\nby other inmates of threatening behavior.\n\n     This claim implicates the adequacy of the medical care\n\nprovided in the jail.   “[T]here is no significant distinction\n\nbetween pretrial detainees and convicted inmates concerning basic\n\nhuman needs such as medical care.”    Gibbs v. Grimmette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"24448\"><a href=\"/opinion/24448/gibbs-v-grimmette/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548 (5th Cir. 2001).   To establish liability, a pretrial\n\ndetainee must “show that a state official acted with deliberate\n\nindifference to a substantial risk of serious medical harm and\n\nthat injuries resulted.”    Wagner v. Bay City, Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"22029\"><a href=\"/opinion/22029/wagner-v-bay-city-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">227</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n324 (5th Cir. 2000); see Estelle v.

This fact, if\n\ntrue, does not show that Sheriff Sollie and Jail Administrator\n\nCallahan were subjectively aware of this fact or that they acted\n\nwith deliberate indifference to Serton’s need for a cane.     See\n\nThompkins v. Belt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"493922\"><a href=\"/opinion/493922/george-thompkins-cross-appellee-v-bill-belt-sheriff-avoyelles-parish/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (5th Cir. 1987)\n\n(“[S]upervisory officials are not liable for the actions of\n\nsubordinates on any theory of vicarious liability.”).\n\f                           No. 02-61010\n                                -9-\n\n     Serton complains that he became depressed and suicidal while\n\nin lockdown and that Sheriff Sollie and Jail Administrator\n\nCallahan acted with deliberate indifference to his mental\n\ncondition.   The record reflects that, after Serton threatened to\n\ncommit suicide, he was placed on suicide watch until he could be\n\nseen by a counselor.   Serton argues only that Sheriff Sollie and\n\nJail Administrator Callahan caused his depression by putting him\n\nin lockdown, by taking his cane away, and by making him\n\nuncomfortable.   These allegations do not show that the defendants\n\nacted with deliberate indifference to his mental condition.\n\n     Serton contends that he became diabetic as a result of the\n\nstress of incarceration and that he was not provided with\n\nimmediate treatment.   These allegations do not show that the\n\ndefendants acted with deliberate indifference to a serious\n\nmedical condition.   The record reflects that Serton’s diabetes\n\nwas treated.\n\n     Serton has raised no issue with respect to the granting of\n\nsummary judgment for the Board of Supervisors or with respect to\n\nhis Fourth Amendment, denial-of-access-to-courts, and state-law\n\ntort claims.
