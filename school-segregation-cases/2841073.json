Parham, Jr. (Van Jr.) from pursuing their collateral suit regarding the subject\nproperty.\n\n      On appeal, Parham Enterprises, Inc. (PEI) and Rhetta Parham (Rhetta), the\npresident of PEI, urge the trial court erred by (a) granting the motion for partial\nsummary judgment, (b) enforcing an “expired” temporary injunction, and (c)\nawarding Diane attorney’s fees despite a failure to segregate. Partnership and Van\nJr. challenge the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction over Diane’s suit and\nDiane’s standing to seek injunctive relief against them. Partnership and Van Jr.\nalso assert the trial court erred in entering the injunction against them.       As\nexplained below, we affirm the trial court’s judgment as modified.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      Diane was married to Shawn Parham in June 2004. On June 22, 2004,\nShawn conveyed the subject property to PEI. PEI is a corporation that was owned\nand controlled by Van Parham, Sr. and Rhetta. Diane worked for PEI until she and\nShawn were separated in August 2005; they were divorced in May 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      On September 22, 2007, Rhetta, as president of PEI, signed a deed\nattempting to convey the subject property to Partnership.            However, it is\nundisputed that the warranty deed identified the wrong lot within the Farmette\nMeadows Section and named a non-existent entity, Parham Family Limited\nPartnership No. 2, as grantee. The warranty deed, including these errors, was\nrecorded in the real property records of Harris County. In July 2008, Diane\nobtained a judgment against PEI for around $82,500 in County Court at Law No. 3\nrelated to PEI’s unauthorized use of her personal credit cards. The transfer of the\nsubject property occurred during the pendency of the credit card dispute. Diane\nattempted to execute her judgment against PEI once it became final, but was\nunsuccessful. She abstracted this judgment in the Harris County deed records on\nSeptember 22, 2008.\n\n      On January 28, 2009, Diane, as a judgment creditor, filed a petition to set\naside deed, for declaratory judgment, for fraudulent transfer and for a temporary\nrestraining order (TRO) and temporary injunction. She named PEI and Rhetta as\ndefendants. Diane asserted that the September 22, 2007 deed conveying Lot 1 was\na fraudulent conveyance of the subject property to a non-existent entity made to\n“delay, hinder, or defraud” Diane in her efforts to collect that judgment. Diane\nsought to set aside “the purported transfer and an order of sale . . . for disposition\nand satisfaction of [her] judgment,” a declaratory judgment, a TRO and temporary\ninjunction against further conveyances of the subject property, actual damages that\n“exceed $84,000 but are within the jurisdictional limits of this court,” and\nattorney’s fees. The trial court issued a TRO on February 2 and set the hearing on\nthe temporary injunction for February 13.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f       On February 13, Diane obtained a temporary injunction against PEI and\nRhetta, prohibiting them from “deeding, transferring or conveying” Lot 1. The\ntrial court set the matter for trial on July 15.\n\n       On February 27, Van Jr. and Partnership filed a petition in intervention\n(mistakenly styled an “interpleader”), asserting an interest in the subject property.\nDiane filed an amended petition naming Van Parham Sr., Van Jr., Partnership, and\nV.E. Parham Jr. Management Corp. as additional defendants. She also added\nclaims for conspiracy and exemplary damages against all the defendants.\n\n       During the remainder of 2009, the defendants filed and continued various\ndispositive motions. The parties agreed to continue numerous trial settings and the\nparties unsuccessfully mediated.          In 2010, the trial court denied all of the\ndefendants’ dispositive motions, Van Sr. passed away, and Diane amended her\npetition to remove Van Sr. and V.E. Parham Jr. Management Corp. as parties and\ndelete her claim for exemplary damages.               And, the parties agreed to more\ncontinuances, moving the trial into 2011. On September 19, 2011, Diane filed a\nmotion for partial summary judgment against PEI only. In this motion, she sought\njudgment on her claims for declaratory judgment and for fraudulent transfer. This\nmotion was set for submission on October 7. Diane attached to her motion (1) a\ncopy of the recorded deed on the subject property, bearing the two errors in lot and\ngrantee, (2) a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State certifying that there is\nno record of any business entity, foreign or domestic, by the name of Parham\nFamily Limited Partnership No. 2,1 and (3) evidence in support of her fraudulent\ntransfer claim, including an appraisal of the subject property at the time of the\npurported transfer.      Rhetta and PEI responded to Diane’s motion for partial\n\n       1\n         This certificate notes that a similarly named entity, Partnership, had been identified\nthrough the Secretary of State’s record search.\n\n                                              4\n\fsummary judgment. Intervenors 2 Partnership and Van Jr. also filed a response to\nDiane’s motion.\n\n       Later in September, Diane filed a third amended petition restating her\nprevious claims; and adding a claim for piercing the corporate veil against Rhetta,\nseeking to hold her individually liable for disregarding the corporate form of PEI.\nA week later, Diane filed a “notice of disobedience of the temporary injunction,”\nasking the court to hold PEI and Rhetta, individually and as president of PEI, in\ncontempt. In this notice, she asserted:\n\n       The Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] were served with the Plaintiff’s\n       Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Thursday, September 15,\n       2011. In a calculated bad faith attempt to defeat the partial summary\n       judgment motion, the Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] violated the\n       Court’s Temporary Injunction Order on Friday, September 23, 2011\n       by filing an amended and alleged corrected Warranty Deed to the\n       subject property Lot 9 with the county clerk.\n       The trial court heard this motion on October 12. After the hearing, the trial\ncourt signed an order holding PEI and Rhetta in contempt. In this order, the trial\ncourt declared the deed executed by PEI and Rhetta on September 22, 2011 (filed\non September 23) void and fined Rhetta “$500.00 as punishment for contempt” of\nthe temporary injunction. The trial court further ordered PEI and Rhetta to obey\nthe contempt order and the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction. In the order,\nthe trial court stated the temporary injunction “remains in effect for any and all\npurposes.” The trial court also signed a trial setting that day, setting the case for\ntrial on January 23, 2012.\n\n\n\n       2\n         The parties variously spell this word as “intervenor” and “intervener.”           For\nconsistency’s sake, we spell it “intervenor” throughout this opinion, except where it has been\nquoted from the record.\n\n                                              5\n\f      Two days before the hearing on Diane’s motion for contempt, Diane filed a\nmotion to strike the intervention of Partnership and Van Jr. At a hearing on\nOctober 19, 2011, Diane orally dropped her conspiracy claims against all the\nparties. The trial court signed a partial non-suit with prejudice of these claims that\nsame date. The trial court also signed an order granting Diane’s motion to strike\nthe intervention of Partnership and Van Jr. According to the trial court’s findings,\nPartnership and Van Jr. filed a motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration in\nresponse to the trial court’s order striking their intervention. 3\n\n      Diane filed an amended petition on November 7 naming only PEI and\nRhetta as defendants. In this petition, Diane sought to set aside the September 22,\n2007 deed, a declaratory judgment that this deed was void, and alternative relief\nfor fraudulent transfer, piercing the corporate veil, and fraud. She further alleged\nthat February 13, 2009 temporary injunction remained in effect.\n\n      On January 17, 2012, Partnership and Van Jr. filed an action to quiet title to\nthe subject property in Harris County Probate Court No. 1, which was overseeing\nthe probate of the estate of Van Sr. This quiet-title action was based on the\nSeptember 22, 2007 deed. On January 19, PEI and Rhetta filed a motion in the\nunderlying cause here to transfer venue to the probate court. The motion also\ncomplained that, due to the amount in controversy, the court did not have\njurisdiction, and that the court had improperly excluded necessary parties by\nstriking Partnerhsip/Van Jr.’s petition in intervention. Although Diane responded\nto the motion, it appears that the motion was neither set for hearing nor ruled upon.\n\n      On January 23, 2012, the trial court signed an order granting Diane’s\nSeptember 19 motion for partial summary judgment against PEI. Specifically, the\n\n      3\n        Our record does not contain a copy of the motion for new trial/motion for\nreconsideration filed by Partnership and Van Jr.\n\n                                            6\n\ftrial court’s order: “GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment\nagainst the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. regarding the issue that the\nwarranty deed executed on September 22, 2007 is void.”\n\n       The next day, the trial court signed an order denying Partnership and Van\nJr.’s motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration. Also on January 24, Diane\nand PEI proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of attorney’s fees only. 4 After a brief\njury trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Diane’s reasonable and necessary\nattorney’s fees for preparation and trial to be $75,000, for an appeal to the court of\nappeals to be $25,000, and for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas to be\n$15,000.\n\n       Following the trial, Diane filed an amended petition on February 6, 2012,\nlisting Partnership and Van Jr. as “intervenors.” In addition to the claims listed\nabove that Diane had raised in her previous pleadings, she sought an anti-suit TRO\nand temporary injunction against Partnership and Van Jr., enjoining them from\npursuing their “mirror lawsuit” to quiet title. The trial court granted the TRO on\nFebruary 8 and set the temporary injunction for a hearing on February 20. Counsel\nfor Partnership and Van Jr. appeared at the February 8 hearing on the TRO as\n“amici curiae.”\n\n       Diane’s February 15 motion for temporary injunction against Partnership\nand Van Jr. cited Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code section 65.011, which\nprovides, “A writ of injunction may be granted if a party performs or is about to\nperform . . . an act relating to the subject of pending litigation, in violation of the\nrights of the applicant, and the act would tend to render the judgment in that\n\n       4\n         The reporter’s record from the pretrial conference reflects that Diane non-suited her\nclaims against Rhetta for piercing the corporate veil regarding responsibility for attorney’s fees.\nAccording to the trial transcript, the only issue thus remaining was Diane’s attorney’s fees\nagainst PEI.\n\n                                                7\n\flitigation ineffectual; the applicant is entitled to a writ of injunction under the\nprinciples of equity and the statutes of this state relating to injunction.” 5 She noted\nin this motion that “on the eve of trial,” she was served with citation and a copy of\nthe intervenors’ original petition for declaratory judgment in the probate court\nregarding the deed/title to the subject property. She alleged that in this “mirror\nlawsuit,” Partnership and Van Jr. were attempting to re-litigate the identical issues\nregarding the deed/title to the subject property, which was the subject of “this\npending litigation.” She stated that on January 23, the trial court had signed a\npartial summary judgment in her favor, in which the court had issued an order that\nthe September 22, 2007 deed issued by PEI was void. She further noted that on\nJanuary 24, 2012, the trial court signed an order denying Partnership’s motion for\nnew trial or motion for reconsideration. She asserted that the trial court had\njurisdiction over Partnership and Van Jr. because they consented to the court’s\njurisdiction regarding their motion for new trial, which was not denied until\nJanuary 24, 2012. Diane also alleged she was entitled to an anti-suit temporary\ninjunction to address a threat to the court’s jurisdiction, to prevent the evasion of\nimportant public policy, to prevent a multiplicity of suits, or to protect a party from\nvexatious or harassing litigation, citing Bridas Corp. v. Unocal Corp. and Golden\nRule Insurance v. Harper.6\n\n      Partnership and Van Jr. responded to this motion, “without waiving citation,\nservice of process, or making a general appearance.” They asserted that the trial\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case because the property in\nquestion was valued at over $300,000, which exceeded the jurisdictional limits of\nthe maximum amount in controversy for statutory county courts in Harris County.\n      5\n          Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 65.011.\n      6\n        See Golden Rule Ins. v. Harper, 925 S.W.2d 649, 651 (Tex. 1996); Bridas Corp. v.\nUnocal Corp., 16 S.W.3d 887, 891 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. dism’d w.o.j.).\n\n                                              8\n\fThey further claimed that, rather than maintaining the status quo, as a temporary\ninjunction was intended to do, granting a temporary injunction in this case would\ndestroy the status quo. They asserted that the probate court had now obtained\ndominant jurisdiction over their claims, which was evidenced by the need for\nDiane to seek leave of court to amend her pleadings, post-jury trial and\nconcurrently with the temporary injunction hearing. Citing United States Fidelity\n& Guaranty Co. v. Beuhler, they alleged that a plaintiff may not dismiss claims\nagainst defendants, proceed to a jury trial without them, and after a trial on the\nmerits, rejoin them as a party in the same case, particularly as intervenors.7\nFinally, they contended that Diane was judicially estopped from obtaining\ninjunctive relief against them because she had them struck and dismissed from the\ncase.\n\n        After an evidentiary hearing on February 20, 2012, at which counsel for all\nparties and putative parties appeared, the trial court granted the temporary\ninjunction, as well as granting Diane leave to amend her petition. Bond was set at\n$1,000, and the case was set for trial on the permanent injunction on June 4, 2012.\n\n        Partnership and Van Jr. filed a plea to the jurisdiction and answer on\nFebruary 27. In their plea to the jurisdiction, they asserted that the trial court\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction because the property at issue was valued above\nthe jurisdictional limits of the statutory county court at law. They also filed a\nverified denial, urging that there was a defect in parties—they were named as\nintervenors after their petition in intervention had been struck. They asserted that\nno such intervention existed and that because Diane had proceeded to a jury trial\non the merits, she could no longer, post-trial, sue them as intervenors in an\n\n        7\n        U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co. v. Beuhler, 597 S.W.2d 523, 524 (Tex. Civ. App.—Beaumont\n1980, no writ).\n\n                                          9\n\fadjudicated matter. Subject to several affirmative defenses, they filed a general\ndenial.\n\n      Also on February 27, the trial court signed an interlocutory judgment. 8 In\nthis interlocutory judgment, the trial court included the following regarding\nsummary judgment regarding the void deed:\n\n              Plaintiff Diane Morgan timely filed a motion for partial\n      summary judgment against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc.\n      regarding the issue that the warranty deed attempting to transfer the\n      title to [the subject property] was void.\n            On January 23, 2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings,\n      the motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendant, the response\n      of the Interveners, the law, and the facts, granted the Plaintiff’s\n      motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant Parham\n      Enterprises, Inc. The Order is attached as Exhibit ‘A’ and\n      incorporated by reference.\n            The court hereby renders judgment for Plaintiff Diane Morgan\n      that the warranty deed attempting to transfer title to the subject\n      property . . . and executed on or about September 22, 2007 is void.\n\n(emphasis added). This interlocutory judgment also iterated the jury verdict on\nfees against PEI, and the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction against\nPartnership and the February 20, 2012 temporary injunction against Partnership\nand Van Jr.\n\n      At the June 4, 2012 evidentiary hearing on the permanent injunction, counsel\nfor Partnership and Van Jr. again raised the issue that they had been brought into\nthe case as intervenors even though their petition in intervention had been struck\nand Diane had non-suited her claims against them:\n\n\n\n       8\n        The word “Final” was struck out by the trial court and the word “Interlocutory” was\nhandwritten above it. Language of finality was also struck from the end of the judgment.\n\n                                            10\n\f      This Court on October the 12th [2011] had a hearing. And at that\n      hearing Diane Morgan’s counsel nonsuited my clients and nonsuited\n      with prejudice. The Court signed off on an order on October 19th\n      nonsuiting with prejudice any conspiracy claims. Then what\n      transpired is the Court in -- well, actually Diane Morgan filed a fourth\n      amended petition. And in that fourth amended petition, she dropped\n      all claims against Parham Family Limited Partnership and Dr. Van E.\n      Parham, Jr.\n             The Court also struck the intervention that my clients filed back\n      in October as well. Therefore, they ceased being parties at the very\n      latest at the beginning of November. The Court proceeded to go to\n      trial on the merits. It was a jury trial. The Court granted a motion for\n      summary judgment at the end of January prior to trial and then went\n      right into a jury trial to which the Parham Family Limited Partnership\n      and Dr. Van E. Parham were not parties, nor were they given notice of\n      the trial.\n             Your Honor, I’m not sure what -- the Court granted a post-trial\n      leave to amend for Diane Morgan in which she has sued my clients as\n      intervenors which the Court struck back in October.\n              Your Honor, under the Rules of Procedure, once you proceed to\n      trial, anything that’s not submitted at that point in time is abandoned\n      and under 165 that’s exactly what we have here. Is Ms. Morgan\n      asking the Court for a new trial?\n\nThe trial court responded that it had already ruled on Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s\nmotion to dismiss by denying it and asked the parties to proceed on the permanent\ninjunction hearing. Both sides presented evidence and argument. On June 11,\n2012, the trial court signed an order granting a permanent injunction “restraining\nthe Interveners from prosecuting a mirror lawsuit regarding the deed/title to Lot 9\nin Harris County Probate court No. [1] or any other Court.”\n\n      The trial court signed a final judgment on August 8, 2012. This judgment\nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n              The Defendants in this litigation are Parham Enterprises,\n      Inc. . . . and Rhetta Parham. Van Parham Sr. was a defendant in this\n\n                                           11\n\flitigation, but he died during the pendency of this litigation on\nNovember 2, 2010 and was non-suited on or about September 20,\n2011.\n     The Interveners in this litigation are Van Parham Jr. and\nParham Family Limited Partnership . . . .\n       On January 23, 2012, the Court after considering the pleadings,\nthe motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendants, the\nresponse of the Interveners, the law, and the facts granted the\nPlaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc. . . .\n      The court hereby RENDERS judgment for Plaintiff Diane\nMorgan that the warranty deed attempting to transfer the title to the\nsubject property . . . and executed on or about September 22, 2007 is\nvoid.\n       On January 24, 2012, this case was called for trial regarding the\nfact issue of attorney fees. Plaintiff, Diane Morgan, appeared in\nperson and through her attorney and announced ready for trial.\nDefendant, Parham Enterprises, Inc., appeared through its\nrepresentative (President), Ms. Rhetta Parham and through its attorney\nand announced ready for trial.\n      After a jury was impaneled and sworn, it heard the evidence\nand arguments of counsel. . . . Because it appears to the Court that the\nverdict of the jury was for the Plaintiff, Diane Morgan, and against the\ndefendant Parham Enterprises, Inc., judgment should be rendered on\nthe verdict in favor of the Plaintiff, Diane Morgan and against the\nDefendant Parham Enterprises, Inc.\n                                  ***\n                           INJUNCTIONS\n       On February 13, 2009, this Court issued a Temporary\nInjunction against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. and\nrestrained the Defendant from deeding, transferring or conveying all\nor any part of the subject property . . . from the date of the Order and\nwhile this cause is pending or until further order of the Court. This\nTemporary Injunction remains in effect for any and all purposes\nagainst the Defendant until further order from this Court.\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\fThe final judgment also incorporated the permanent injunction against Partnership\nand Van Jr., described above. All court costs were taxed against PEI.\n\n        From this judgment, PEI, Rhetta, Partnership, and Van Jr. timely appealed. 9\n\n                                       II. ANALYSIS\n\nA.      Jurisdictional Issues\n\n        In their first two issues, Partnership and Van Jr. challenge the trial court’s\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the case below and Diane’s standing to seek\ninjunctive relief against them. Because these issues attack the jurisdiction of the\ntrial court, we address them first.\n\n     1. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n        Partnership and Van Jr. assert that the trial court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over the proceedings below because the amount in controversy\nexceeded the trial court’s statutory authority. Subject matter jurisdiction may not\nbe conferred by consent or waiver, and its absence may be raised at any time.\nCarroll v. Carroll, 304 S.W.3d 366, 367 (Tex. 2010) (citing Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v.\nTex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 445 (Tex. 1993)). Whether a trial court has\nsubject matter jurisdiction is a question of law we review de novo. Tex. Natural\nRes. Conservation Comm’n v. IT—Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. 2002).\n\n        Here, Partnership and Van Jr. contend that Diane alleged the property at\nissue in this case was worth $340,000, which exceeds the Texas Legislature’s grant\nof jurisdiction to statutory county courts at law over amounts in controversy\n\n\n\n        9\n         The trial court filed findings of fact and conclusions of law on October 4, 2012, after\nPartnership and Van Jr. filed a notice that such findings and conclusions were past due and they\nhad filed both a first and second request for them.\n\n                                              13\n\fbetween $500 and $200,000.             See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1).10\nSection 25.0003 of the Texas Government Code governs the general jurisdiction of\nstatutory county courts and proscribes the monetary jurisdictional limits of them.\nSee id. § 25.0003.         But section 25.1032 of the Government Code contains\nadditional jurisdictional provisions particular to Harris County civil courts at law.\nSee id. § 25.1032. Subsections 25.1032(c)(1) and (3) provide the Harris County\ncivil courts at law jurisdiction to “decide the issue of title to real or personal\nproperty” and to “hear a suit for the enforcement of a lien on real property.” Id.\n§ 25.1032(c)(1), (3).\n\n       Diane brought this suit to decide the issue of title to real property. She\nsought a determination of whether title to Lot 9 remained with PEI or had been\nconveyed to another. See id. § 25.1032(c)(1). Additionally, Diane sought to\nenforce the judgment lien from her prior suit in County Civil Court at Law No. 3\nagainst Lot 9 if it found the deed void.               See id. § 25.1032(c)(3).         Indeed,\nPartnership and Van Jr. acknowledge in their briefing that Diane is “trying to\nestablish and determine title to real property,” albeit they claim it is “regarding a\nsale to which she was not a party or has a justiciable interest.” The jurisdiction\nprovided by section 25.1032 is based on the subject matter of the claim, not the\namount in controversy. See AIC Mgmt. v. Crews, 246 S.W.3d 640, 644 (Tex.\n2008) (“Section 25.1032(c)(1) thus bases the county civil courts’ jurisdiction on\nthe type of claim, not the amount of money in dispute.”); see also Haas v. Ashford\nHollow Comty. Improvement Ass’n, Inc., 209 S.W.3d 875, 880 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.) (same). Thus, we conclude that County Court\n\n       10\n          At the time this suit was filed, the amount in controversy ceiling for statutory county\ncourts was $100,000. However, this amount was raised to $200,000 effective January 1, 2012.\nSee Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1). Because Partnership and Van Jr. assert that Diane’s\nallegations exceed even the current amount, we will refer to the current enactment for ease of\nreference.\n\n                                               14\n\fat Law No. 3 properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this matter based\non the type of claims Diane brought.\n\n      Further, we review de novo whether a pleader has alleged facts that\naffirmatively demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction.       Tex. Dep’t of Parks &\nWildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004). We construe pleadings\nliberally in favor of the plaintiff and look to the pleader’s intent. See id. (citing\nTex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d at 446). The plaintiff’s allegations in the petition\nregarding the amount in controversy control for jurisdictional purposes unless the\nparty challenging jurisdiction pleads and proves that the allegations were made\nfraudulently to obtain jurisdiction. Cont’l Coffee Prods. Co. v. Cazarez, 937\nS.W.2d 444, 449 (Tex. 1996); see also Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224 n.4; Bland\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).\n\n      Here, in her original petition, Diane alleged damages exceeding $84,000 but\n“within the jurisdictional limits of this court.” Partnership and Van Jr. neither\npleaded nor proved that Diane’s allegations of the amount in controversy were\nmade fraudulently for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction. Thus, the allegations\nin her petition regarding the amount in controversy control for jurisdictional\npurposes. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224 n.4; Cont’l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at 449.\nSection 25.0003(c)(1) of the Texas Government Code provides jurisdiction for\nstatutory county courts over matters in controversy between $500 and $200,000\n“as alleged on the face of the petition.” Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1)\n(emphasis added).     As noted above, the jurisdictional maximum amount in\ncontroversy at the time Diane filed her suit was $100,000. Diane’s allegation of\ndamages on the face of her petition falls below this maximum amount; thus, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\ftrial court had jurisdiction over this matter even under the more general provision\nof jurisdiction provided by section 25.0003. 11\n\n       Finally, with certain exceptions not relevant here, when jurisdiction is\nlawfully and properly acquired, no later fact or event deprives the court of\njurisdiction. Cont’l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at 449; Kubovy v. Cypress-Fairbanks\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 972 S.W.2d 130, 133 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, no\npet.). Thus, once the trial court properly obtained subject matter jurisdiction over\nthis matter, it did not later lose it based on the contents of its judgment, as asserted\nby Partnership and Van Jr.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that County Civil Court at Law\nNo. 3 properly acquired subject matter jurisdiction over Diane’s suit. We therefore\noverrule Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s first issue.\n\n   2. Diane’s Standing\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. assert that Diane lacked standing to seek an anti-suit\ninjunction against them because she lacked any interest in the subject property\n“without a perfected judgment lien.” A party must have standing to maintain suit.\nSee Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tex 1993).\n\n\n       11\n           Partnership and Van Jr. cite Eris v. Giannakopoulos, a case from our sister court, for\nthe proposition that “[w]hen a suit is for an interest in real property or to foreclose a lien on real\nproperty, rather than damages, the value of the property interest at issue determines the amount\nin controversy.” 369 S.W.3d 618, 622 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In\nGiannakopoulos, the plaintiff did not contain a statement of jurisdiction or otherwise identify the\namount in controversy. Id. at 622. Here, Diane’s petition did contain a jurisdictional statement\nidentifying an amount in controversy. Further, the plaintiff in Giannakopoulos brought suit to\npartition three separate but adjacent and contiguous properties, of which he owned a fifty percent\ninterest. Id. at 619. The trial court granted a partition of the properties, dividing them into two\nequal-sized lots and awarding one to the plaintiff. Id. at 620. Diane, on the other hand, sued to\nhave a title declared void, for fraudulent transfer, and for damages. Nowhere in her pleadings\ndoes she seek to obtain an interest in the property. Thus, the analysis in Giannakopoulos is\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\n                                                 16\n\fUnder Texas law, a plaintiff has standing to bring suit if she has suffered a distinct\ninjury, and there exists a real controversy between the parties that will be\ndetermined by the judicial determination sought. Brown v. Todd, 53 S.W.3d 297,\n305 (Tex. 2011). The requirement that a real controversy exist between the parties\nthat will be determined by the trial court refers to the presentation of a justiciable\ninterest. Salas v. LNV Corp., 409 S.W.3d 209, 216 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 2013, no pet.).\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. assert that there is no real controversy between the\nparties that will be determined by any judicial declaration sought because PEI sold\nthe subject property to Partnership before Diane’s “failed attempts to perfect a\njudgment lien or interest in the property.” In other words, Partnership and Van Jr.\nargue that Diane cannot have standing because the transfer about which she\ncomplains took place nine months prior to Diane’s claim against PEI resulting in\njudgment. 12    But their assertion ignores the provisions of the Texas Uniform\nFraudulent Transfer Act that include “creditor’s claim[s that] arose before or\nwithin a reasonable time after the transfer was made or the obligation was\nincurred.” Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.005(a) (emphasis added). Thus,\nPartnership and Van Jr.’s argument begs the entire question of Diane’s case: Is the\nSeptember 22, 2007 deed purporting to transfer the subject property void as a\nfraudulent conveyance or otherwise?\n\n       If the purported conveyance failed to transfer the property to Partnership,\nthen title of the property remained with PEI, and Diane’s judgment lien against PEI\nattached. Thus, Diane had a clear justiciable interest in whether her judgment lien\nattached to a property she alleges was fraudulently transferred to Partnership to\n\n       12\n          See infra section B.3 regarding the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of Diane\non her fraudulent transfer claim.\n\n                                             17\n\fdefeat her monetary claim against PEI; the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act\nprovides that justiciable interest because she was not a party to the transaction.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we overrule Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s challenge to\nDiane’s standing to bring this suit. 13\n\n       Having addressed the jurisdictional issues presented by Partnership and Van\nJr., we turn to the trial court’s summary judgment declaring the September 22,\n2007 deed void.\n\nB.     Validity of the Deed\n\n       In PEI and Rhetta’s first issue, they assert that the trial court erred in\ndeclaring this deed void by traditional summary judgment because Diane failed to\nconclusively establish that the deed lacked the legal requisites to qualify as a deed.\n\n       We review the trial court’s granting of a summary judgment de novo.\nFerguson v. Bldg. Materials Corp. of Am., 295 S.W.3d 642, 644 (Tex. 2009) (per\ncuriam). To be entitled to summary judgment under Rule 166a(c), a movant must\nestablish that there is no genuine issue of material fact so that the movant is\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp Advisors,\nInc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). We take as true all evidence\nfavorable to the nonmovant and resolve any doubt in the nonmovant’s favor.\n20801, Inc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 399 (Tex. 2008).                       We consider the\nevidence presented in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting\nevidence favorable to the nonmovant if reasonable fact finders could, and\n\n       13\n           As discussed above, Diane initially sued PEI and Rhetta, seeking to set aside the deed\nand for fraudulent transfer. Partnership and Van Jr. then intervened in the lawsuit asserting their\ninterest as the purported grantee of the subject property. Diane added claims against them for\nconspiracy, but later nonsuited those claims. Their intervention was also struck on Diane’s\nmotion; they filed a motion for reconsideration/new trial. A permanent anti-suit injunction was\nentered against them in the trial court’s final judgment, the propriety of which is addressed later\nin this opinion.\n\n                                                18\n\fdisregarding evidence contrary to the nonmovant unless reasonable fact finders\ncould not. Mann Frankfort, 289 S.W.3d at 848.\n\n      1. The Trial Court Grants Summary Judgment on All Bases\n\n      PEI and Rhetta argue that the trial court’s summary judgment should be\nreversed because their evidence conclusively established the grantee’s existence.\nThey do not urge an issue concerning Diane’s fraudulent transfer claim. Instead,\nthey state that the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment solely on\nthe basis of the declaratory judgment act claim. We disagree.\n\n      Diane sought partial summary judgment. By her motion, Diane asked the\ntrial court to set aside the deed and return the subject property to PEI. Diane\nargued both that (a) PEI failed in its attempt to transfer the subject property\nbecause the deed was defective and (b) PEI violated Texas Uniform Fraudulent\nTransfer Act section 24.005. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.005. The trial\ncourt granted the motion for partial summary judgment. The trial court did not\ngrant the motion for partial summary judgment in part. When it incorporated the\nsummary judgment order into the judgment, the trial court stated: “On January 23,\n2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings, the motion, the affidavits, the\nresponse of the Defendants, the response of the Interveners, the law, and the facts\ngranted Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc.”\n\n      Nevertheless, PEI and Rhetta urge that the motion was granted in part. They\nappear to rely upon a single sentence in the summary judgment order as a limit on\nthe grounds for granting. Specifically, the trial court’s summary judgment order\nalso stated: “The Grantee, Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, was not in\nexistence at the time the deed was executed.” However, this is merely a statement\nof an undisputed fact. The order does not purport to resolve only the legal effect of\n                                         19\n\fthe undisputed fact. Instead, the summary judgment order declares the deed void,\nwhich is precisely the relief Diane sought on both her declaratory judgment claim\nand her fraudulent transfer claim. Based upon the plain language of the order, we\nconclude that the trial court granted Diane’s motion for partial summary judgment\non both her Declaratory Judgment action and her fraudulent transfer claim.\n       Further, to the extent that there was any confusion about whether the trial\ncourt granted a fraudulent transfer summary judgment, 14 the trial court clarified it\nwhen, at the trial on the permanent injunction, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n       Mr. Toups [Partnership/Van Jr.]: Your Honor, you granted a motion\n       for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment.\n       The Court: They both said yes, I set it aside. So, I’m not sure why\n       we’re all on a different page.\n       Mr. Thomas [Diane]: You declared it void.\n       The Court: I declared it void. Okay. Same thing, in my mind. When\n       I declared it void, I considered it in my mind fraudulent and set it\n       aside, hence, the declaring it void.\n(emphasis added).\n       For PEI and Rhetta to obtain a reversal of the motion for partial summary\njudgment, they must attack every ground relied on for which summary judgment\ncould have been granted. See Malooly Bros. Inc. v. Napier, 461 S.W.2d 119, 121\n(Tex. 1970). Where an appellant fails to challenge even one of the grounds, the\nappellate court may affirm the summary judgment on that ground alone. See\nTrevino & Assoc. Mech., L.P., 400 S.W.3d 139, 144 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no\npet.). Although PEI and Rhetta do not include an issue on appeal attacking the trial\ncourt’s summary judgment on fraudulent conveyance, they argue the merits of the\n       14\n           Diane does not appear to have been confused about the order. As PEI and Rhetta point\nout, Diane did not attempt to try the fraudulent transfer claim to the court or a jury. PEI and\nRhetta characterize such failure as waiver. But Diane did not need to submit this claim to the\njury; the trial court had already granted her summary judgment on it.\n\n                                              20\n\fclaim in the body of their brief. Therefore, we construe the brief to adequately\nraise the point.\n\n      2. Declaratory Judgment\n\n      This court has previously stated that “in Texas, a deed is void if the grantee\nis not in existence at the time the deed is executed.” Lighthouse Church of\nCloverleaf v. Tex. Bank, 889 S.W.2d 595, 600 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n1994, writ denied). Diane attached evidence to her summary judgment motion that\nestablished that Parham Partnership No. 2 was not in existence at the time the deed\nwas executed; she provided a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State stating\nthat there was no record of the existence of this entity. As outlined above, PEI and\nRhetta do not dispute this point.\n\n      Instead, PEI and Rhetta assert that a deed is not void if the grantee exists but\nreceives the deed in an assumed name, citing Buist v. Connell. 233 S.W.2d 458,\n462 (Tex. Civ. App.—Eastland 1950, writ. ref’d). They contend that “the fact that\nPartnership directed that the deed be taken in the name of Parham Family Limited\nPartnership No. 2[] would not void or invalidate the deed under the assumed name\nstatutes of Texas.”\n\n      In considering grounds for reversal, we are limited to those grounds\nexpressly set forth in the summary-judgment motions, answers, or other responses,\nand may not rely on the appellate briefs or summary-judgment evidence. D.M.\nDiamond Corp. v. Dunbar Armored, Inc., 124 S.W.3d 655, 659–60 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.) (op. on reh’g) (citing Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c);\nMcConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 341 (Tex.1993)).\nThese grounds were not presented to the trial court by PEI or Rhetta. Instead, PEI\nand Rhetta maintained in the trial court that both the conveyance to “Parham\nFamily Partnership No. 2” and the conveyance of Lot 1, rather than Lot 9, were\n                                         21\n\f“clerical errors” that properly could be corrected by a “correction deed” relating\nback to September 22, 2007. Thus, we may not consider this argument raised for\nthe first time on appeal as a ground for reversing summary judgment.\n\n      In sum, Diane presented conclusive evidence that the deed from PEI, dated\nSeptember 22, 2007, attempted to convey the subject property to a non-existent\nentity. “[I]n Texas, a deed is void if the grantee is not in existence at the time the\ndeed is executed.”      Lighthouse Church of Cloverleaf, 889 S.W.2d at 600.\nAccordingly, Diane established as a matter of law that the September 22, 2007\ndeed was void. The trial court did not err in so declaring.\n\n      3. Fraudulent Transfer\n\n      PEI and Rhetta argue that Diane was not entitled to summary judgment on\nher fraudulent transfer claim because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to\nboth PEI’s intent to fraudulently transfer the property and the reasonably\nequivalent value received for the property. PEI and Rhetta correctly argue that\nPEI’s intent is an element running through several of Diane’s theories of fraudulent\ntransfer. For example, section 24.005(a)(1) permits Diane to avoid the transfer if\nthe “debtor made the transfer . . . with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any\ncreditor of the debtor.”       Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.005(a)(1).\nAlternatively, section 24.005(a)(2) permits Diane to avoid the transfer without\nproving PEI’s intent if she establishes that PEI made the transfer without receiving\na reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer. Diane sought summary\njudgment on both subsections (1) and (2).\n\n      PEI and Rhetta responded with, inter alia, the affidavit of Rhetta. She\naverred that she was an officer and owner of PEI on September 22, 2007, when\nPEI made the subject transfer. She further stated that it was her intent to transfer\nthe subject property to Partnership. Rhetta describes the conveyance and the\n                                          22\n\famount paid for the subject property. Finally, Rhetta states that “[t]he sale of the\nproperty was done to either hinder, delay or defraud Diane Morgan fka Diane\nParham.” Thus, Rhetta’s affidavit supplies conclusive evidence that she, on behalf\nof PEI, transferred the subject property with actual intent to hinder, delay, or\ndefault Diane as creditor in satisfaction of 24.005(a)(1). With such evidence of\nintent, the parties’ dispute over whether the transferor paid reasonably equivalent\nvalue for the property under subsection (2) became immaterial. The trial court\nproperly granted the summary judgment on the alternative basis urged.\n\n        We overrule PEI’s and Rhetta’s first issue.\n\nC.      Injunctive Relief\n\n        In their second issue, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in granting and enforcing a procedurally flawed temporary injunction\nand continuing it in its final judgment. Partnership and Van Jr. complain in their\nthird issue that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a “post-trial anti-suit\npermanent injunction against dismissed non-parties prohibiting them from\nprosecuting a quiet-title suit for real property.” We address each of these issues in\nturn.\n\n        1. The Temporary Injunction Against PEI and Rhetta\n\n        We review a trial court’s decision to grant a temporary injunction for an\nabuse of discretion. Butnaru v. Ford Motor Co., 84 S.W.3d 198, 204 (Tex. 2002).\nA temporary injunction is an extraordinary remedy that does not issue as a matter\nof right. Id. Temporary injunction orders are strictly construed to ensure that they\ncomply with Rule 683 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.               Kaufmann v.\nMorales, 93 S.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2002, no pet.).\nAn order that does not comply with this rule “is subject to being declared void and\n\n\n                                           23\n\fdissolved.” Qwest Comm’ns Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 24 S.W.3d 334, 337 (Tex.\n2000).\n\n       First, PEI and Rhetta assert that the temporary injunction issued against\nthem in February 2009 in this case violates Rule 683 by referring to another\ndocument, the September 2007 warranty deed, as grounds for issuance and to\ndescribe the acts sought to be enjoined. A temporary injunction shall be specific in\nits terms and shall describe in reasonable detail, not by reference to the complaint\nor other document, the act or acts to be restrained. Tex. R. Civ. P. 683. The order\nat issue here does not simply refer to another document; rather, it attaches the deed\nas an exhibit to the temporary injunction.             “Rule 683 is not violated when\ndocuments are attached to the injunction and referred to it as part of the injunction\nbecause the attachments become part of the injunction itself.” Layton v. Ball, 396\nS.W.3d 747, 753 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2013, no pet.) (citing Tex. Pet Foods, Inc. v.\nState, 529 S.W.2d 820, 829 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1975, writ. ref’d n.r.e.)).\n\n       Next, PEI and Rhetta assert that the temporary injunction expired because\nthe order stated it was set for trial on July 15, 2009. As noted above, however,\nthere were numerous trial continuances. Further, at the hearing on Diane’s motion\nfor contempt filed against PEI and Rhetta for violation of the temporary injunction,\nheld on October 12, 2011, counsel for PEI and Rhetta never asserted that the\ntemporary injunction was no longer in effect. Instead, counsel asserted that their\nactions in filing a correction deed did not violate the temporary injunction. In the\ncourt’s order of contempt against PEI and Rhetta, the trial court stated, “The\nTemporary Injunction issued by this Court was effective from February 13, 2009\nand while this litigation is pending or until further order of this court . . . .” 15 Thus,\n\n       15\n          PEI and Rhetta also complain about the order of contempt, signed October 12, 2011,\nagainst them based on their violation of the temporary injunction. However, we lack jurisdiction\nto address complaints about the contempt order. See Cadle Co. v. Lobingier, 50 S.W.3d 662,\n                                              24\n\fPEI and Rhetta have not met their burden, as appellants, to establish that the\nFebruary 2009 temporary injunction was not still in effect until the trial court\nentered a judgment on the merits of Diane’s claim. See, e.g., Butnaru, 84 S.W.3d\nat 204 (providing that the purpose of a temporary injunction is to preserve the\nstatus quo pending a trial on the merits of the litigation’s subject matter).16\n\n       Finally, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court erred by continuing the\nFebruary 2009 temporary injunction in the final judgment of the trial court. We\nagree with this portion of their issue. As noted above, the purpose of a temporary\ninjunction is to preserve the litigation’s subject matter pending a trial on the merits.\nId. This purpose is not served by continuing a temporary injunction in a final\njudgment; such a process effectively transforms a temporary injunction into a\npermanent injunction without a trial. See EMC Mortgage Corp. v. Jones, 252\nS.W.3d 857, 866 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.) (op. on reh’g); EOG\nResources, Inc. v. Gutierrez, 75 S.W.3d 50, 53 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002, no\npet.); cf. Kaufman, 93 S.W.3d at 657 (“There are at least two reasons for requiring\na trial date on the [temporary injunction] order. One is to prevent the injunction\nfrom becoming permanent.”).           Thus, the trial court erred by continuing the\nFebruary 2009 temporary injunction in the final judgment.\n\n       Accordingly, we sustain this portion of PEI and Rhetta’s second issue and\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to remove the following language from it:\n\n       The Court issued a Temporary Injunction against the Defendant\n       Parham Enterprises, Inc. on February 13, 2009 and restrained the\n\n671 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2001, pet. denied) (“Decisions in contempt proceedings cannot be\nreviewed on appeal because contempt orders are not appealable, even when appealed along with\na judgment that is appealable.”); see also In re B.A.C., 144 S.W.3d 8, 10–12 (Tex. App.—Waco\n2004, no pet.) (listing cases).\n       16\n          We note that even if we were to declare the temporary injunction void, the contempt\norder based upon it is not reviewable by direct appeal. See supra note 15.\n\n                                             25\n\f       Defendant from deeding, transferring or conveying all or part of the\n       subject property 18610 Tomato Street, Spring, Harris County, Texas\n       77379 from the date of the Order and while this cause was pending or\n       until further order of the Court. This Temporary Injunction continues\n       against the Defendant until 180 days after all appeals are completed or\n       until further order from this Court.\n\nWe overrule this issue to the extent that it involves complaints about the temporary\ninjunction prior to entry of the final judgment and the order of contempt based on\nit.\n\n       2. The Permanent Anti-Suit Injunction Against Partnership and Van Jr.\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. assert that the trial court abused its discretion in\nentering a permanent “post-trial” anti-suit injunction against them because (a) they\nwere no longer parties to the suit, (b) they had a legal right to pursue the action to\nquiet title in another court, and (c) the anti-suit injunction lacks both a cause of\naction and evidentiary support.\n\n       We begin by noting what is not disputed within this issue. First, Partnership\nand Van Jr. do not appeal the trial court’s order striking their intervention. As\nsuch, Partnership and Van, Jr. do not have a justiciable interest in Diane’s\nfraudulent transfer/declaratory judgment action. Second, Partnership and Van Jr.\ndid not file a motion to strike Diane’s post-trial, pre-judgment amended petition\nnaming them as intervenors and they do not appeal the trial court’s grant of leave\nto file that petition.\n\n       Finally, although Partnership and Van Jr. complain that the court held a trial\n(against PEI on fees) without their participation, they do not complain that they\nwere without notice or an opportunity to be heard on the anti-suit injunction. To\nthe contrary, Partnership and Van Jr. participated in the hearing on the anti-suit\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\finjunction. Thus, we only address the sufficiency of the evidence to enter the anti-\nsuit injunction.\n\n      We review an order granting a permanent injunction for an abuse of\ndiscretion. Operation Rescue-Nat’l v. Planned Parenthood of Houston & Se. Tex.,\nInc., 975 S.W.2d 546, 560 (Tex. 1998). “An anti-suit injunction is appropriate in\nfour instances: (1) to address a threat to the court’s jurisdiction; (2) to prevent the\nevasion of important public policy; (3) to prevent a multiplicity of suits; or (4) to\nprotect a party from vexatious or harassing litigation.” Golden Rule Ins. Co. v.\nHarper, 925 S.W.2d 649, 651 (Tex. 1996).            Although there are “no precise\nguidelines” for reviewing an anti-suit injunction, we will uphold an injunction\nissued to protect a court’s dominant jurisdiction where, if the enjoined party were\nallowed to proceed, the dominant court would lose its ability to proceed with the\ncase. See, e.g., Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Webb, 899 S.W.2d 899, 902 (Tex. App. –\nTexarkana 1991, no writ).\n\n      Diane supported her request for anti-suit injunction with evidence that her\nsuit pertained to title to the subject property, and that she filed the suit prior to\nPartnership and Van Jr.’s suit to quiet title in the subject property—also a suit\npertaining to title. The evidence showed that Diane, a judgment creditor, filed her\nsuit alleging that PEI, a judgment debtor, made a fraudulent conveyance of the\nsubject property. Her pleading sought to set aside “the purported transfer” of the\nsubject property.\n\n      At the time of Diane’s request for anti-suit injunction, the trial court had\nalready granted an affirmative motion for summary judgment on Diane’s claims\nand declared the September 22, 2007 deed void. The trial court had already held\nthe attempted correction deed of September 22, 2011, void as a violation of the\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fcourt’s injunction. Finally, the trial court determined that Partnership and Van Jr.’s\nlawsuit regarding the “deed/title to” the subject property is a “mirror lawsuit.”\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. offer no argument about how the two suits did not or\nwould not interfere with one another.               Partnership and Van Jr. confine their\narguments to the impairment of their rights in the subject property. As noted\nabove, however, Partnership and Van Jr. have not appealed the striking of their\nintervention, and they offer no argument on appeal in support of their rights to the\nfraudulently transferred property. Given the trial court’s unchallenged ruling that\nPartnership and Van Jr. do not have a justiciable interest in the property, that court\nhad the authority to enjoin them from contending otherwise in the probate court. If\nPartnership and Van Jr. are implying that Partnership accepted the transfer in good\nfaith and for reasonably equivalent value, as recognized by Texas Uniform\nFraudulent Transfer Act section 24.009(a), they neglected to preserve that\nargument in these proceedings through an appeal of their justiciable interest in the\nproperty. 17   See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.009(1) (“A transfer or\nobligation is not voidable under Section 24.005(a)(1) of this code against a person\nwho took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any\nsubsequent transferee or obligee.”)\n\n       We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nentering an anti-suit injunction to protect its jurisdiction over the subject property.\n\nD.     Segregation of Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In PEI’s third issue, it asserts that Diane failed to segregate her attorney’s\nfees. PEI further asserts that the appellate attorney’s fees are not conditioned on\nDiane’s prevailing on appeal.\n       17\n         We note that Partnership and Van, Jr. have abandoned their claim in the trial court that\nthey were necessary parties to the fraudulent transfer action.\n\n                                               28\n\f      A failure to segregate attorney’s fees can result in the recovery of no such\nfees. Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951 S.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. 1997). But if no one\nobjects to a jury charge in which the jury is not asked to segregate fees, then the\nobjection is waived. Jackson v. LongAgriBusiness, L.L.C., No. 14-11-01073-CV,\n2013 WL 84921, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Jan. 8, 2013, no pet.)\n(mem. op) (citing Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Solis, 951 S.W.2d at 389; Ogden v.\nRyals, No. 14-10-01052-CV, 2012 WL 3016856, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] July 24, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op)). PEI—the only party against whom fees\nwere assessed—made no objection to the jury charge on attorney’s fees. Thus, we\ndo not address this portion of its issue. See id.\n\n      As to the remainder of PEI’s third issue, the judgment conditions the award\nof appellate attorney’s fees on PEI’s failure on appeal:\n\n      In the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. to\n      the court of appeals, if the appeal is unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane\n      Morgan will be further entitled to $25,000.00 as a reasonable\n      attorney’s fee; in the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham\n      Enterprises, Inc. to the Supreme Court of Texas, if the appeal is\n      unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane Morgan will be further entitled to\n      $15,000.00 as a reasonable attorney’s fee.\nSuch an award is tantamount to conditioning it on Diane’s appellate success\nagainst PEI; for Diane to succeed on appeal, PEI must fail on its issues.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we overrule PEI’s third issue.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n      In sum, we have concluded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction\nover this case and that Diane had standing to bring her claims.             We have\naccordingly overruled Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s first and second issues. We have\nfurther determined that the trial court properly granted Diane’s partial summary\n\n                                          29\n\fjudgment on all bases; thus we have overruled PEI’s and Rhetta’s first issue.\nFurther, we have overruled PEI’s and Rhetta’s third issue regarding segregation of\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion by enforcing the February 13,\n2009 temporary injunction against PEI, and we lack jurisdiction to consider that\nportion of PEI’s and Rhetta’s complaint regarding the trial court’s contempt order.\nHowever, the trial court did improperly include this temporary injunction in the\nfinal judgment, and we therefore have sustained in part PEI’s second issue. We\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to remove the language concerning this\ntemporary injunction from the final judgment. Finally, we have concluded that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in entering a permanent anti-suit injunction\nagainst Partnership and Van Jr. We thus overruled the third and final issue of\nPartnership and Van Jr.\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n                                /s/           Sharon McCally\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices McCally, Busby, and Wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f",

Parham, Jr. (Van Jr.) from pursuing their collateral suit regarding the subject\nproperty.\n\n      On appeal, Parham Enterprises, Inc. (PEI) and Rhetta Parham (Rhetta), the\npresident of PEI, urge the trial court erred by (a) granting the motion for partial\nsummary judgment, (b) enforcing an “expired” temporary injunction, and (c)\nawarding Diane attorney’s fees despite a failure to segregate. Partnership and Van\nJr. challenge the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction over Diane’s suit and\nDiane’s standing to seek injunctive relief against them. Partnership and Van Jr.\nalso assert the trial court erred in entering the injunction against them.       As\nexplained below, we affirm the trial court’s judgment as modified.\n\n                                 I. BACKGROUND\n\n      Diane was married to Shawn Parham in June 2004. On June 22, 2004,\nShawn conveyed the subject property to PEI. PEI is a corporation that was owned\nand controlled by Van Parham, Sr. and Rhetta. Diane worked for PEI until she and\nShawn were separated in August 2005; they were divorced in May 2006.\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      On September 22, 2007, Rhetta, as president of PEI, signed a deed\nattempting to convey the subject property to Partnership.            However, it is\nundisputed that the warranty deed identified the wrong lot within the Farmette\nMeadows Section and named a non-existent entity, Parham Family Limited\nPartnership No. 2, as grantee. The warranty deed, including these errors, was\nrecorded in the real property records of Harris County. In July 2008, Diane\nobtained a judgment against PEI for around $82,500 in County Court at Law No. 3\nrelated to PEI’s unauthorized use of her personal credit cards. The transfer of the\nsubject property occurred during the pendency of the credit card dispute. Diane\nattempted to execute her judgment against PEI once it became final, but was\nunsuccessful. She abstracted this judgment in the Harris County deed records on\nSeptember 22, 2008.\n\n      On January 28, 2009, Diane, as a judgment creditor, filed a petition to set\naside deed, for declaratory judgment, for fraudulent transfer and for a temporary\nrestraining order (TRO) and temporary injunction. She named PEI and Rhetta as\ndefendants. Diane asserted that the September 22, 2007 deed conveying Lot 1 was\na fraudulent conveyance of the subject property to a non-existent entity made to\n“delay, hinder, or defraud” Diane in her efforts to collect that judgment. Diane\nsought to set aside “the purported transfer and an order of sale . . . for disposition\nand satisfaction of [her] judgment,” a declaratory judgment, a TRO and temporary\ninjunction against further conveyances of the subject property, actual damages that\n“exceed $84,000 but are within the jurisdictional limits of this court,” and\nattorney’s fees. The trial court issued a TRO on February 2 and set the hearing on\nthe temporary injunction for February 13.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f       On February 13, Diane obtained a temporary injunction against PEI and\nRhetta, prohibiting them from “deeding, transferring or conveying” Lot 1. The\ntrial court set the matter for trial on July 15.\n\n       On February 27, Van Jr. and Partnership filed a petition in intervention\n(mistakenly styled an “interpleader”), asserting an interest in the subject property.\nDiane filed an amended petition naming Van Parham Sr., Van Jr., Partnership, and\nV.E. Parham Jr. Management Corp. as additional defendants. She also added\nclaims for conspiracy and exemplary damages against all the defendants.\n\n       During the remainder of 2009, the defendants filed and continued various\ndispositive motions. The parties agreed to continue numerous trial settings and the\nparties unsuccessfully mediated.          In 2010, the trial court denied all of the\ndefendants’ dispositive motions, Van Sr. passed away, and Diane amended her\npetition to remove Van Sr. and V.E. Parham Jr. Management Corp. as parties and\ndelete her claim for exemplary damages.               And, the parties agreed to more\ncontinuances, moving the trial into 2011. On September 19, 2011, Diane filed a\nmotion for partial summary judgment against PEI only. In this motion, she sought\njudgment on her claims for declaratory judgment and for fraudulent transfer. This\nmotion was set for submission on October 7. Diane attached to her motion (1) a\ncopy of the recorded deed on the subject property, bearing the two errors in lot and\ngrantee, (2) a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State certifying that there is\nno record of any business entity, foreign or domestic, by the name of Parham\nFamily Limited Partnership No. 2,1 and (3) evidence in support of her fraudulent\ntransfer claim, including an appraisal of the subject property at the time of the\npurported transfer.      Rhetta and PEI responded to Diane’s motion for partial\n\n       1\n         This certificate notes that a similarly named entity, Partnership, had been identified\nthrough the Secretary of State’s record search.\n\n                                              4\n\fsummary judgment. Intervenors 2 Partnership and Van Jr. also filed a response to\nDiane’s motion.\n\n       Later in September, Diane filed a third amended petition restating her\nprevious claims; and adding a claim for piercing the corporate veil against Rhetta,\nseeking to hold her individually liable for disregarding the corporate form of PEI.\nA week later, Diane filed a “notice of disobedience of the temporary injunction,”\nasking the court to hold PEI and Rhetta, individually and as president of PEI, in\ncontempt. In this notice, she asserted:\n\n       The Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] were served with the Plaintiff’s\n       Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Thursday, September 15,\n       2011. In a calculated bad faith attempt to defeat the partial summary\n       judgment motion, the Defendants [PEI] and [Rhetta] violated the\n       Court’s Temporary Injunction Order on Friday, September 23, 2011\n       by filing an amended and alleged corrected Warranty Deed to the\n       subject property Lot 9 with the county clerk.\n       The trial court heard this motion on October 12. After the hearing, the trial\ncourt signed an order holding PEI and Rhetta in contempt. In this order, the trial\ncourt declared the deed executed by PEI and Rhetta on September 22, 2011 (filed\non September 23) void and fined Rhetta “$500.00 as punishment for contempt” of\nthe temporary injunction. The trial court further ordered PEI and Rhetta to obey\nthe contempt order and the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction. In the order,\nthe trial court stated the temporary injunction “remains in effect for any and all\npurposes.” The trial court also signed a trial setting that day, setting the case for\ntrial on January 23, 2012.\n\n\n\n       2\n         The parties variously spell this word as “intervenor” and “intervener.”           For\nconsistency’s sake, we spell it “intervenor” throughout this opinion, except where it has been\nquoted from the record.\n\n                                              5\n\f      Two days before the hearing on Diane’s motion for contempt, Diane filed a\nmotion to strike the intervention of Partnership and Van Jr. At a hearing on\nOctober 19, 2011, Diane orally dropped her conspiracy claims against all the\nparties. The trial court signed a partial non-suit with prejudice of these claims that\nsame date. The trial court also signed an order granting Diane’s motion to strike\nthe intervention of Partnership and Van Jr. According to the trial court’s findings,\nPartnership and Van Jr. filed a motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration in\nresponse to the trial court’s order striking their intervention. 3\n\n      Diane filed an amended petition on November 7 naming only PEI and\nRhetta as defendants. In this petition, Diane sought to set aside the September 22,\n2007 deed, a declaratory judgment that this deed was void, and alternative relief\nfor fraudulent transfer, piercing the corporate veil, and fraud. She further alleged\nthat February 13, 2009 temporary injunction remained in effect.\n\n      On January 17, 2012, Partnership and Van Jr. filed an action to quiet title to\nthe subject property in Harris County Probate Court No. 1, which was overseeing\nthe probate of the estate of Van Sr. This quiet-title action was based on the\nSeptember 22, 2007 deed. On January 19, PEI and Rhetta filed a motion in the\nunderlying cause here to transfer venue to the probate court. The motion also\ncomplained that, due to the amount in controversy, the court did not have\njurisdiction, and that the court had improperly excluded necessary parties by\nstriking Partnerhsip/Van Jr.’s petition in intervention. Although Diane responded\nto the motion, it appears that the motion was neither set for hearing nor ruled upon.\n\n      On January 23, 2012, the trial court signed an order granting Diane’s\nSeptember 19 motion for partial summary judgment against PEI. Specifically, the\n\n      3\n        Our record does not contain a copy of the motion for new trial/motion for\nreconsideration filed by Partnership and Van Jr.\n\n                                            6\n\ftrial court’s order: “GRANTS Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment\nagainst the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. regarding the issue that the\nwarranty deed executed on September 22, 2007 is void.”\n\n       The next day, the trial court signed an order denying Partnership and Van\nJr.’s motion for new trial/motion for reconsideration. Also on January 24, Diane\nand PEI proceeded to a jury trial on the issue of attorney’s fees only. 4 After a brief\njury trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Diane’s reasonable and necessary\nattorney’s fees for preparation and trial to be $75,000, for an appeal to the court of\nappeals to be $25,000, and for an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas to be\n$15,000.\n\n       Following the trial, Diane filed an amended petition on February 6, 2012,\nlisting Partnership and Van Jr. as “intervenors.” In addition to the claims listed\nabove that Diane had raised in her previous pleadings, she sought an anti-suit TRO\nand temporary injunction against Partnership and Van Jr., enjoining them from\npursuing their “mirror lawsuit” to quiet title. The trial court granted the TRO on\nFebruary 8 and set the temporary injunction for a hearing on February 20. Counsel\nfor Partnership and Van Jr. appeared at the February 8 hearing on the TRO as\n“amici curiae.”\n\n       Diane’s February 15 motion for temporary injunction against Partnership\nand Van Jr. cited Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code section 65.011, which\nprovides, “A writ of injunction may be granted if a party performs or is about to\nperform . . . an act relating to the subject of pending litigation, in violation of the\nrights of the applicant, and the act would tend to render the judgment in that\n\n       4\n         The reporter’s record from the pretrial conference reflects that Diane non-suited her\nclaims against Rhetta for piercing the corporate veil regarding responsibility for attorney’s fees.\nAccording to the trial transcript, the only issue thus remaining was Diane’s attorney’s fees\nagainst PEI.\n\n                                                7\n\flitigation ineffectual; the applicant is entitled to a writ of injunction under the\nprinciples of equity and the statutes of this state relating to injunction.” 5 She noted\nin this motion that “on the eve of trial,” she was served with citation and a copy of\nthe intervenors’ original petition for declaratory judgment in the probate court\nregarding the deed/title to the subject property. She alleged that in this “mirror\nlawsuit,” Partnership and Van Jr. were attempting to re-litigate the identical issues\nregarding the deed/title to the subject property, which was the subject of “this\npending litigation.” She stated that on January 23, the trial court had signed a\npartial summary judgment in her favor, in which the court had issued an order that\nthe September 22, 2007 deed issued by PEI was void. She further noted that on\nJanuary 24, 2012, the trial court signed an order denying Partnership’s motion for\nnew trial or motion for reconsideration. She asserted that the trial court had\njurisdiction over Partnership and Van Jr. because they consented to the court’s\njurisdiction regarding their motion for new trial, which was not denied until\nJanuary 24, 2012. Diane also alleged she was entitled to an anti-suit temporary\ninjunction to address a threat to the court’s jurisdiction, to prevent the evasion of\nimportant public policy, to prevent a multiplicity of suits, or to protect a party from\nvexatious or harassing litigation, citing Bridas Corp. v. Unocal Corp. and Golden\nRule Insurance v. Harper.6\n\n      Partnership and Van Jr. responded to this motion, “without waiving citation,\nservice of process, or making a general appearance.” They asserted that the trial\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear this case because the property in\nquestion was valued at over $300,000, which exceeded the jurisdictional limits of\nthe maximum amount in controversy for statutory county courts in Harris County.\n      </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span>\n          <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">Civ</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

They asserted that the probate court had now obtained\ndominant jurisdiction over their claims, which was evidenced by the need for\nDiane to seek leave of court to amend her pleadings, post-jury trial and\nconcurrently with the temporary injunction hearing. Citing United States Fidelity\n& Guaranty Co. v. Beuhler, they alleged that a plaintiff may not dismiss claims\nagainst defendants, proceed to a jury trial without them, and after a trial on the\nmerits, rejoin them as a party in the same case, particularly as intervenors.7\nFinally, they contended that Diane was judicially estopped from obtaining\ninjunctive relief against them because she had them struck and dismissed from the\ncase.\n\n        After an evidentiary hearing on February 20, 2012, at which counsel for all\nparties and putative parties appeared, the trial court granted the temporary\ninjunction, as well as granting Diane leave to amend her petition.

In their plea to the jurisdiction, they asserted that the trial court\nlacked subject matter jurisdiction because the property at issue was valued above\nthe jurisdictional limits of the statutory county court at law. They also filed a\nverified denial, urging that there was a defect in parties—they were named as\nintervenors after their petition in intervention had been struck.

Subject to several affirmative defenses, they filed a general\ndenial.\n\n      Also on February 27, the trial court signed an interlocutory judgment. 8 In\nthis interlocutory judgment, the trial court included the following regarding\nsummary judgment regarding the void deed:\n\n              Plaintiff Diane Morgan timely filed a motion for partial\n      summary judgment against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc.\n      regarding the issue that the warranty deed attempting to transfer the\n      title to [the subject property] was void.\n            On January 23, 2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings,\n      the motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendant, the response\n      of the Interveners, the law, and the facts, granted the Plaintiff’s\n      motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant Parham\n      Enterprises, Inc. The Order is attached as Exhibit ‘A’ and\n      incorporated by reference.\n            The court hereby renders judgment for Plaintiff Diane Morgan\n      that the warranty deed attempting to transfer title to the subject\n      property . . . and executed on or about September 22, 2007 is void.\n\n(emphasis added). This interlocutory judgment also iterated the jury verdict on\nfees against PEI, and the February 13, 2009 temporary injunction against\nPartnership and the February 20, 2012 temporary injunction against Partnership\nand Van Jr.\n\n      At the June 4, 2012 evidentiary hearing on the permanent injunction, counsel\nfor Partnership and Van Jr. again raised the issue that they had been brought into\nthe case as intervenors even though their petition in intervention had been struck\nand Diane had non-suited her claims against them:\n\n\n\n       8\n        The word “Final” was struck out by the trial court and the word “Interlocutory” was\nhandwritten above it. Language of finality was also struck from the end of the judgment.\n\n                                            10\n\f      This Court on October the 12th [2011] had a hearing. And at that\n      hearing Diane Morgan’s counsel nonsuited my clients and nonsuited\n      with prejudice. The Court signed off on an order on October 19th\n      nonsuiting with prejudice any conspiracy claims. Then what\n      transpired is the Court in -- well, actually Diane Morgan filed a fourth\n      amended petition. And in that fourth amended petition, she dropped\n      all claims against Parham Family Limited Partnership and Dr. Van E.\n      Parham, Jr.\n             The Court also struck the intervention that my clients filed back\n      in October as well. Therefore, they ceased being parties at the very\n      latest at the beginning of November. The Court proceeded to go to\n      trial on the merits. It was a jury trial. The Court granted a motion for\n      summary judgment at the end of January prior to trial and then went\n      right into a jury trial to which the Parham Family Limited Partnership\n      and Dr. Van E. Parham were not parties, nor were they given notice of\n      the trial.\n             Your Honor, I’m not sure what -- the Court granted a post-trial\n      leave to amend for Diane Morgan in which she has sued my clients as\n      intervenors which the Court struck back in October.\n              Your Honor, under the Rules of Procedure, once you proceed to\n      trial, anything that’s not submitted at that point in time is abandoned\n      and under 165 that’s exactly what we have here. Is Ms. Morgan\n      asking the Court for a new trial?\n\nThe trial court responded that it had already ruled on Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s\nmotion to dismiss by denying it and asked the parties to proceed on the permanent\ninjunction hearing. Both sides presented evidence and argument. On June 11,\n2012, the trial court signed an order granting a permanent injunction “restraining\nthe Interveners from prosecuting a mirror lawsuit regarding the deed/title to Lot 9\nin Harris County Probate court No. [1] or any other Court.”\n\n      The trial court signed a final judgment on August 8, 2012. This judgment\nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n              The Defendants in this litigation are Parham Enterprises,\n      Inc. . . . and Rhetta Parham. Van Parham Sr. was a defendant in this\n\n                                           11\n\flitigation, but he died during the pendency of this litigation on\nNovember 2, 2010 and was non-suited on or about September 20,\n2011.\n     The Interveners in this litigation are Van Parham Jr. and\nParham Family Limited Partnership . . . .\n       On January 23, 2012, the Court after considering the pleadings,\nthe motion, the affidavits, the response of the Defendants, the\nresponse of the Interveners, the law, and the facts granted the\nPlaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc. . . .\n      The court hereby RENDERS judgment for Plaintiff Diane\nMorgan that the warranty deed attempting to transfer the title to the\nsubject property . . . and executed on or about September 22, 2007 is\nvoid.\n       On January 24, 2012, this case was called for trial regarding the\nfact issue of attorney fees.

Because it appears to the Court that the\nverdict of the jury was for the Plaintiff, Diane Morgan, and against the\ndefendant Parham Enterprises, Inc., judgment should be rendered on\nthe verdict in favor of the Plaintiff, Diane Morgan and against the\nDefendant Parham Enterprises, Inc.\n                                  ***\n                           INJUNCTIONS\n       On February 13, 2009, this Court issued a Temporary\nInjunction against the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. and\nrestrained the Defendant from deeding, transferring or conveying all\nor any part of the subject property . . . from the date of the Order and\nwhile this cause is pending or until further order of the Court.

Jurisdictional Issues\n\n        In their first two issues, Partnership and Van Jr. challenge the trial court’s\nsubject matter jurisdiction over the case below and Diane’s standing to seek\ninjunctive relief against them. Because these issues attack the jurisdiction of the\ntrial court, we address them first.\n\n     1. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n        Partnership and Van Jr. assert that the trial court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over the proceedings below because the amount in controversy\nexceeded the trial court’s statutory authority. Subject matter jurisdiction may not\nbe conferred by consent or waiver, and its absence may be raised at any time.\nCarroll v.

See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1).10\nSection 25.0003 of the Texas Government Code governs the general jurisdiction of\nstatutory county courts and proscribes the monetary jurisdictional limits of them.\nSee id. § 25.0003.         But section 25.1032 of the Government Code contains\nadditional jurisdictional provisions particular to Harris County civil courts at law.\nSee id. § 25.1032. Subsections 25.1032(c)(1) and (3) provide the Harris County\ncivil courts at law jurisdiction to “decide the issue of title to real or personal\nproperty” and to “hear a suit for the enforcement of a lien on real property.” Id.\n§ 25.1032(c)(1), (3).\n\n       Diane brought this suit to decide the issue of title to real property. She\nsought a determination of whether title to Lot 9 remained with PEI or had been\nconveyed to another. See id. § 25.1032(c)(1). Additionally, Diane sought to\nenforce the judgment lien from her prior suit in County Civil Court at Law No. 3\nagainst Lot 9 if it found the deed void.               See id. § 25.1032(c)(3).         Indeed,\nPartnership and Van Jr. acknowledge in their briefing that Diane is “trying to\nestablish and determine title to real property,” albeit they claim it is “regarding a\nsale to which she was not a party or has a justiciable interest.” The jurisdiction\nprovided by section 25.1032 is based on the subject matter of the claim, not the\namount in controversy.

However, this amount was raised to $200,000 effective January 1, 2012.\nSee Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1). Because Partnership and Van Jr. assert that Diane’s\nallegations exceed even the current amount, we will refer to the current enactment for ease of\nreference.\n\n                                               14\n\fat Law No. 3 properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over this matter based\non the type of claims Diane brought.\n\n      Further, we review de novo whether a pleader has alleged facts that\naffirmatively demonstrate subject matter jurisdiction.

Thus, the allegations\nin her petition regarding the amount in controversy control for jurisdictional\npurposes. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 224 n.4; Cont’l Coffee, 937 S.W.2d at 449.\nSection 25.0003(c)(1) of the Texas Government Code provides jurisdiction for\nstatutory county courts over matters in controversy between $500 and $200,000\n“as alleged on the face of the petition.” Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 25.0003(c)(1)\n(emphasis added).     As noted above, the jurisdictional maximum amount in\ncontroversy at the time Diane filed her suit was $100,000. Diane’s allegation of\ndamages on the face of her petition falls below this maximum amount; thus, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         15\n\ftrial court had jurisdiction over this matter even under the more general provision\nof jurisdiction provided by section 25.0003. 11\n\n       Finally, with certain exceptions not relevant here, when jurisdiction is\nlawfully and properly acquired, no later fact or event deprives the court of\njurisdiction.

Thus, once the trial court properly obtained subject matter jurisdiction over\nthis matter, it did not later lose it based on the contents of its judgment, as asserted\nby Partnership and Van Jr.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that County Civil Court at Law\nNo. 3 properly acquired subject matter jurisdiction over Diane’s suit. We therefore\noverrule Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s first issue.\n\n   2. Diane’s Standing\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. assert that Diane lacked standing to seek an anti-suit\ninjunction against them because she lacked any interest in the subject property\n“without a perfected judgment lien.” A party must have standing to maintain suit.\nSee Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex.

Giannakopoulos, a case from our sister court, for\nthe proposition that “[w]hen a suit is for an interest in real property or to foreclose a lien on real\nproperty, rather than damages, the value of the property interest at issue determines the amount\nin controversy.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In\nGiannakopoulos, the plaintiff did not contain a statement of jurisdiction or otherwise identify the\namount in controversy. Id. at 622. Here, Diane’s petition did contain a jurisdictional statement\nidentifying an amount in controversy. Further, the plaintiff in Giannakopoulos brought suit to\npartition three separate but adjacent and contiguous properties, of which he owned a fifty percent\ninterest. Id. at 619. The trial court granted a partition of the properties, dividing them into two\nequal-sized lots and awarding one to the plaintiff. Id. at 620. Diane, on the other hand, sued to\nhave a title declared void, for fraudulent transfer, and for damages. Nowhere in her pleadings\ndoes she seek to obtain an interest in the property. Thus, the analysis in Giannakopoulos is\ninapplicable to the facts of this case.\n\n                                                 16\n\fUnder Texas law, a plaintiff has standing to bring suit if she has suffered a distinct\ninjury, and there exists a real controversy between the parties that will be\ndetermined by the judicial determination sought.

App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] 2013, no pet.).\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. assert that there is no real controversy between the\nparties that will be determined by any judicial declaration sought because PEI sold\nthe subject property to Partnership before Diane’s “failed attempts to perfect a\njudgment lien or interest in the property.” In other words, Partnership and Van Jr.\nargue that Diane cannot have standing because the transfer about which she\ncomplains took place nine months prior to Diane’s claim against PEI resulting in\njudgment. 12    But their assertion ignores the provisions of the Texas Uniform\nFraudulent Transfer Act that include “creditor’s claim[s that] arose before or\nwithin a reasonable time after the transfer was made or the obligation was\nincurred.” Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.005(a) (emphasis added). Thus,\nPartnership and Van Jr.’s argument begs the entire question of Diane’s case: Is the\nSeptember 22, 2007 deed purporting to transfer the subject property void as a\nfraudulent conveyance or otherwise?\n\n       If the purported conveyance failed to transfer the property to Partnership,\nthen title of the property remained with PEI, and Diane’s judgment lien against PEI\nattached. Thus, Diane had a clear justiciable interest in whether her judgment lien\nattached to a property she alleges was fraudulently transferred to Partnership to\n\n       12\n          See infra section B.3 regarding the trial court’s summary judgment in favor of Diane\non her fraudulent transfer claim.\n\n                                             17\n\fdefeat her monetary claim against PEI; the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act\nprovides that justiciable interest because she was not a party to the transaction.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we overrule Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s challenge to\nDiane’s standing to bring this suit. 13\n\n       Having addressed the jurisdictional issues presented by Partnership and Van\nJr., we turn to the trial court’s summary judgment declaring the September 22,\n2007 deed void.\n\nB.     Validity of the Deed\n\n       In PEI and Rhetta’s first issue, they assert that the trial court erred in\ndeclaring this deed void by traditional summary judgment because Diane failed to\nconclusively establish that the deed lacked the legal requisites to qualify as a deed.\n\n       We review the trial court’s granting of a summary judgment de novo.\nFerguson v.

Mann Frankfort, 289 S.W.3d at 848.\n\n      1. The Trial Court Grants Summary Judgment on All Bases\n\n      PEI and Rhetta argue that the trial court’s summary judgment should be\nreversed because their evidence conclusively established the grantee’s existence.\nThey do not urge an issue concerning Diane’s fraudulent transfer claim. Instead,\nthey state that the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment solely on\nthe basis of the declaratory judgment act claim. We disagree.\n\n      Diane sought partial summary judgment. By her motion, Diane asked the\ntrial court to set aside the deed and return the subject property to PEI. Diane\nargued both that (a) PEI failed in its attempt to transfer the subject property\nbecause the deed was defective and (b) PEI violated Texas Uniform Fraudulent\nTransfer Act section 24.005. See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.005. The trial\ncourt granted the motion for partial summary judgment. The trial court did not\ngrant the motion for partial summary judgment in part. When it incorporated the\nsummary judgment order into the judgment, the trial court stated: “On January 23,\n2012, the Court, after considering the pleadings, the motion, the affidavits, the\nresponse of the Defendants, the response of the Interveners, the law, and the facts\ngranted Plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment against the Defendant\nParham Enterprises, Inc.”\n\n      Nevertheless, PEI and Rhetta urge that the motion was granted in part. They\nappear to rely upon a single sentence in the summary judgment order as a limit on\nthe grounds for granting. Specifically, the trial court’s summary judgment order\nalso stated: “The Grantee, Parham Family Limited Partnership No. 2, was not in\nexistence at the time the deed was executed.” However, this is merely a statement\nof an undisputed fact. The order does not purport to resolve only the legal effect of\n                                         19\n\fthe undisputed fact. Instead, the summary judgment order declares the deed void,\nwhich is precisely the relief Diane sought on both her declaratory judgment claim\nand her fraudulent transfer claim. Based upon the plain language of the order, we\nconclude that the trial court granted Diane’s motion for partial summary judgment\non both her Declaratory Judgment action and her fraudulent transfer claim.\n       Further, to the extent that there was any confusion about whether the trial\ncourt granted a fraudulent transfer summary judgment, 14 the trial court clarified it\nwhen, at the trial on the permanent injunction, the following colloquy occurred:\n\n       Mr. Toups [Partnership/Van Jr.]: Your Honor, you granted a motion\n       for summary judgment on the declaratory judgment.\n       The Court: They both said yes, I set it aside. So, I’m not sure why\n       we’re all on a different page.\n       Mr. Thomas [Diane]: You declared it void.\n       The Court: I declared it void. Okay. Same thing, in my mind. When\n       I declared it void, I considered it in my mind fraudulent and set it\n       aside, hence, the declaring it void.\n(emphasis added).\n       For PEI and Rhetta to obtain a reversal of the motion for partial summary\njudgment, they must attack every ground relied on for which summary judgment\ncould have been granted.

As PEI and Rhetta point\nout, Diane did not attempt to try the fraudulent transfer claim to the court or a jury. PEI and\nRhetta characterize such failure as waiver. But Diane did not need to submit this claim to the\njury; the trial court had already granted her summary judgment on it.\n\n                                              20\n\fclaim in the body of their brief. Therefore, we construe the brief to adequately\nraise the point.\n\n      2. Declaratory Judgment\n\n      This court has previously stated that “in Texas, a deed is void if the grantee\nis not in existence at the time the deed is executed.” Lighthouse Church of\nCloverleaf v. Tex. Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1633690\"><a href=\"/opinion/1633690/lighthouse-church-of-cloverleaf-v-texas-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n1994, writ denied). Diane attached evidence to her summary judgment motion that\nestablished that Parham Partnership No. 2 was not in existence at the time the deed\nwas executed; she provided a certificate from the Texas Secretary of State stating\nthat there was no record of the existence of this entity. As outlined above, PEI and\nRhetta do not dispute this point.\n\n      Instead, PEI and Rhetta assert that a deed is not void if the grantee exists but\nreceives the deed in an assumed name, citing Buist v. Connell. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n462 (Tex. Civ.

They contend that “the fact that\nPartnership directed that the deed be taken in the name of Parham Family Limited\nPartnership No. 2[] would not void or invalidate the deed under the assumed name\nstatutes of Texas.”\n\n      In considering grounds for reversal, we are limited to those grounds\nexpressly set forth in the summary-judgment motions, answers, or other responses,\nand may not rely on the appellate briefs or summary-judgment evidence.

Instead, PEI\nand Rhetta maintained in the trial court that both the conveyance to “Parham\nFamily Partnership No. 2” and the conveyance of Lot 1, rather than Lot 9, were\n                                         21\n\f“clerical errors” that properly could be corrected by a “correction deed” relating\nback to September 22, 2007. Thus, we may not consider this argument raised for\nthe first time on appeal as a ground for reversing summary judgment.\n\n      In sum, Diane presented conclusive evidence that the deed from PEI, dated\nSeptember 22, 2007, attempted to convey the subject property to a non-existent\nentity. “[I]n Texas, a deed is void if the grantee is not in existence at the time the\ndeed is executed.”      Lighthouse Church of Cloverleaf, 889 S.W.2d at 600.\nAccordingly, Diane established as a matter of law that the September 22, 2007\ndeed was void. The trial court did not err in so declaring.\n\n      3. Fraudulent Transfer\n\n      PEI and Rhetta argue that Diane was not entitled to summary judgment on\nher fraudulent transfer claim because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to\nboth PEI’s intent to fraudulently transfer the property and the reasonably\nequivalent value received for the property. PEI and Rhetta correctly argue that\nPEI’s intent is an element running through several of Diane’s theories of fraudulent\ntransfer. For example, section 24.005(a)(1) permits Diane to avoid the transfer if\nthe “debtor made the transfer . . . with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any\ncreditor of the debtor.”       Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.005(a)(1).\nAlternatively, section 24.005(a)(2) permits Diane to avoid the transfer without\nproving PEI’s intent if she establishes that PEI made the transfer without receiving\na reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer. Diane sought summary\njudgment on both subsections (1) and (2).\n\n      PEI and Rhetta responded with, inter alia, the affidavit of Rhetta. She\naverred that she was an officer and owner of PEI on September 22, 2007, when\nPEI made the subject transfer. She further stated that it was her intent to transfer\nthe subject property to Partnership. Rhetta describes the conveyance and the\n                                          22\n\famount paid for the subject property. Finally, Rhetta states that “[t]he sale of the\nproperty was done to either hinder, delay or defraud Diane Morgan fka Diane\nParham.” Thus, Rhetta’s affidavit supplies conclusive evidence that she, on behalf\nof PEI, transferred the subject property with actual intent to hinder, delay, or\ndefault Diane as creditor in satisfaction of 24.005(a)(1). With such evidence of\nintent, the parties’ dispute over whether the transferor paid reasonably equivalent\nvalue for the property under subsection (2) became immaterial. The trial court\nproperly granted the summary judgment on the alternative basis urged.\n\n        We overrule PEI’s and Rhetta’s first issue.\n\nC.      Injunctive Relief\n\n        In their second issue, PEI and Rhetta assert that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in granting and enforcing a procedurally flawed temporary injunction\nand continuing it in its final judgment. Partnership and Van Jr. complain in their\nthird issue that the trial court abused its discretion in issuing a “post-trial anti-suit\npermanent injunction against dismissed non-parties prohibiting them from\nprosecuting a quiet-title suit for real property.” We address each of these issues in\nturn.\n\n        1.

As noted above, however,\nthere were numerous trial continuances. Further, at the hearing on Diane’s motion\nfor contempt filed against PEI and Rhetta for violation of the temporary injunction,\nheld on October 12, 2011, counsel for PEI and Rhetta never asserted that the\ntemporary injunction was no longer in effect. Instead, counsel asserted that their\nactions in filing a correction deed did not violate the temporary injunction. In the\ncourt’s order of contempt against PEI and Rhetta, the trial court stated, “The\nTemporary Injunction issued by this Court was effective from February 13, 2009\nand while this litigation is pending or until further order of this court . . . .” 15 Thus,\n\n       15\n          PEI and Rhetta also complain about the order of contempt, signed October 12, 2011,\nagainst them based on their violation of the temporary injunction. However, we lack jurisdiction\nto address complaints about the contempt order. See Cadle Co. v.

First, Partnership\nand Van Jr. do not appeal the trial court’s order striking their intervention. As\nsuch, Partnership and Van, Jr. do not have a justiciable interest in Diane’s\nfraudulent transfer/declaratory judgment action. Second, Partnership and Van Jr.\ndid not file a motion to strike Diane’s post-trial, pre-judgment amended petition\nnaming them as intervenors and they do not appeal the trial court’s grant of leave\nto file that petition.\n\n       Finally, although Partnership and Van Jr. complain that the court held a trial\n(against PEI on fees) without their participation, they do not complain that they\nwere without notice or an opportunity to be heard on the anti-suit injunction. To\nthe contrary, Partnership and Van Jr. participated in the hearing on the anti-suit\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\finjunction.

Although there are “no precise\nguidelines” for reviewing an anti-suit injunction, we will uphold an injunction\nissued to protect a court’s dominant jurisdiction where, if the enjoined party were\nallowed to proceed, the dominant court would lose its ability to proceed with the\ncase. See, e.g., Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Webb, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">899</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 902 (Tex. App. –\nTexarkana 1991, no writ).\n\n      Diane supported her request for anti-suit injunction with evidence that her\nsuit pertained to title to the subject property, and that she filed the suit prior to\nPartnership and Van Jr.’s suit to quiet title in the subject property—also a suit\npertaining to title. The evidence showed that Diane, a judgment creditor, filed her\nsuit alleging that PEI, a judgment debtor, made a fraudulent conveyance of the\nsubject property. Her pleading sought to set aside “the purported transfer” of the\nsubject property.\n\n      At the time of Diane’s request for anti-suit injunction, the trial court had\nalready granted an affirmative motion for summary judgment on Diane’s claims\nand declared the September 22, 2007 deed void. The trial court had already held\nthe attempted correction deed of September 22, 2011, void as a violation of the\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fcourt’s injunction. Finally, the trial court determined that Partnership and Van Jr.’s\nlawsuit regarding the “deed/title to” the subject property is a “mirror lawsuit.”\n\n       Partnership and Van Jr. offer no argument about how the two suits did not or\nwould not interfere with one another.               Partnership and Van Jr. confine their\narguments to the impairment of their rights in the subject property. As noted\nabove, however, Partnership and Van Jr. have not appealed the striking of their\nintervention, and they offer no argument on appeal in support of their rights to the\nfraudulently transferred property. Given the trial court’s unchallenged ruling that\nPartnership and Van Jr. do not have a justiciable interest in the property, that court\nhad the authority to enjoin them from contending otherwise in the probate court. If\nPartnership and Van Jr. are implying that Partnership accepted the transfer in good\nfaith and for reasonably equivalent value, as recognized by Texas Uniform\nFraudulent Transfer Act section 24.009(a), they neglected to preserve that\nargument in these proceedings through an appeal of their justiciable interest in the\nproperty. 17   See Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 24.009(1) (“A transfer or\nobligation is not voidable under Section 24.005(a)(1) of this code against a person\nwho took in good faith and for a reasonably equivalent value or against any\nsubsequent transferee or obligee.”)\n\n       We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\nentering an anti-suit injunction to protect its jurisdiction over the subject property.\n\nD.     Segregation of Attorney’s Fees\n\n       In PEI’s third issue, it asserts that Diane failed to segregate her attorney’s\nfees. PEI further asserts that the appellate attorney’s fees are not conditioned on\nDiane’s prevailing on appeal.\n       17\n         We note that Partnership and Van, Jr. have abandoned their claim in the trial court that\nthey were necessary parties to the fraudulent transfer action.\n\n                                               28\n\f      A failure to segregate attorney’s fees can result in the recovery of no such\nfees.

Solis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2382247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2382247/green-intern-inc-v-solis/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (Tex. 1997). But if no one\nobjects to a jury charge in which the jury is not asked to segregate fees, then the\nobjection is waived. Jackson v.

App. P. 33.1(a); Solis, 951 S.W.2d at 389; Ogden v.\nRyals, No. 14-10-01052-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3016856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\nDist.] July 24, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op)). PEI—the only party against whom fees\nwere assessed—made no objection to the jury charge on attorney’s fees. Thus, we\ndo not address this portion of its issue. See id.\n\n      As to the remainder of PEI’s third issue, the judgment conditions the award\nof appellate attorney’s fees on PEI’s failure on appeal:\n\n      In the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham Enterprises, Inc. to\n      the court of appeals, if the appeal is unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane\n      Morgan will be further entitled to $25,000.00 as a reasonable\n      attorney’s fee; in the event of an appeal by the Defendant Parham\n      Enterprises, Inc. to the Supreme Court of Texas, if the appeal is\n      unsuccessful, Plaintiff Diane Morgan will be further entitled to\n      $15,000.00 as a reasonable attorney’s fee.\nSuch an award is tantamount to conditioning it on Diane’s appellate success\nagainst PEI; for Diane to succeed on appeal, PEI must fail on its issues.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we overrule PEI’s third issue.\n\n                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n      In sum, we have concluded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction\nover this case and that Diane had standing to bring her claims.             We have\naccordingly overruled Partnership’s and Van Jr.’s first and second issues. We have\nfurther determined that the trial court properly granted Diane’s partial summary\n\n                                          29\n\fjudgment on all bases; thus we have overruled PEI’s and Rhetta’s first issue.\nFurther, we have overruled PEI’s and Rhetta’s third issue regarding segregation of\nattorney’s fees.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion by enforcing the February 13,\n2009 temporary injunction against PEI, and we lack jurisdiction to consider that\nportion of PEI’s and Rhetta’s complaint regarding the trial court’s contempt order.\nHowever, the trial court did improperly include this temporary injunction in the\nfinal judgment, and we therefore have sustained in part PEI’s second issue. We\nmodify the trial court’s judgment to remove the language concerning this\ntemporary injunction from the final judgment. Finally, we have concluded that the\ntrial court did not abuse its discretion in entering a permanent anti-suit injunction\nagainst Partnership and Van Jr. We thus overruled the third and final issue of\nPartnership and Van Jr.\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n                                /s/           Sharon McCally\n                                              Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices McCally, Busby, and Wise.\n\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f</pre>",
