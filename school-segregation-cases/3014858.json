Readers\nare requested to notify the Clerk of the Supreme Court, Supreme Court Building, Cheyenne, Wyoming\n82002, of any typographical or other formal errors so that correction may be made before final publication in\nthe permanent volume.\n\fFENN, District Judge.\n\n[¶1] Appellant, JonMichael Guy (“Guy”), filed a petition for declaratory judgment,\nasking the district court to find that Director Robert Lampert and Warden Steve Hargett1\n(collectively “Appellees”), violated the Wyoming Public Records Act (“WPRA”) by\ndelaying the production of a record he had requested under the act. He also asked the\ndistrict court to declare that the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) had to produce\ncertain types of records if he requested them in the future, and he asked for an order\nrequiring the staff of the DOC to be trained on the application of the WPRA. The\nAppellees filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the district court lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction, or the petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. Guy then filed a motion to amend his petition. The district court dismissed the\npetition without ruling on Guy’s motion to amend. This appeal followed. We affirm.\n\n                                              ISSUES\n\n[¶2]   Appellant phrases the issues as follows:\n\n               1. Did the district court abuse its discretion when it denied\n                  Mr. Guy leave to amend his pleading?\n\n               2. Did the district court abuse its discretion when it granted\n                  Appellee’s (sic) motion to dismiss?\n\n[¶3]   Appellees phrase the issues as follows:\n\n               1. Wyoming Rule of Civil Procedure 12 allows a district\n                  court to dismiss a case when the court lacks subject matter\n                  jurisdiction or when a complaint fails to state a claim on\n                  which relief can be granted. JonMichael Guy’s request to\n                  view a record under the Wyoming Public Records Act was\n                  granted, but he petitioned the district court for additional\n                  relief. Did the district court err by dismissing Guy’s\n                  petition?\n\n               2. After a responsive pleading has been filed by the\n                  defendant, a plaintiff may amend a complaint only after\n                  receiving permission from the court. Guy sought to\n                  amend his petition to include citations to the Uniform\n                  Declaratory Judgments Act even though his claims did not\n\n1\n The original caption for this case incorrectly identified the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution\nWarden as Donald Hargett instead of Steve Hargett.\n                                                  1\n\f                meet its justifiability (sic) requirements. Did the district\n                court abuse its discretion by dismissing his petition\n                without allowing the amendment?\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n[¶4] Guy is an inmate at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution. On June 22,\n2014, he sent an internal inmate communication form to Steve Hargett, the warden of the\nWyoming Medium Correctional Institution, requesting permission to view the DOC’s\nPolicy and Procedure #1.215, Code of Ethics. On June 23, 2014, Warden Hargett denied\nthe request on the grounds that the Code of Ethics had not been preapproved for inmate\nreview. Later that day, Guy resubmitted his request, this time stating that it had been\nfiled under the WPRA. Guy also sent a similar request to Steve Lindly, the Deputy\nDirector of the DOC. On June 24, 2014, Warden Hargett denied Guy’s request and\ninformed Guy that he was not the person who determined which policies and procedures\nwere available for inmate review, and he did not believe the WPRA applied to the DOC’s\npolicies and procedures. Guy took no further action at that time.\n\n[¶5] On July 14, 2014, Deputy Director Lindly responded to Guy’s June 23, 2014,\nrequest. He explained that while the request had initially been denied, the DOC had\nundertaken further review of the requested policy, had determined that it was a public\nrecord, and Guy should be allowed to view it. Arrangements were made for Guy to view\nthe policy in the prison library a few days later.\n\n[¶6] On July 18, 2014, Guy filed a grievance against Warden Hargett via the DOC’s\ninternal inmate grievance process. Guy alleged that Warden Hargett had unlawfully\ndenied Guy’s public records request. As a remedy for his grievance, Guy requested that\nWarden Hargett receive training on the WPRA and pay a $750.00 fine. Guy’s grievance\nwas reviewed by Grievance Manager, Sergeant Shawn Hobson, who concluded that the\nmatter had been resolved because Guy had been allowed to review the requested record.\nGuy used the prison’s internal process to appeal Grievance Manager Hobson’s decision.\nThe internal appeal was handled by the Department Prison Division Administrator, Dan\nShannon, who likewise determined that no violation of the WPRA had transpired,\nbecause Guy had been given access to the requested record.\n\n[¶7] On September 5, 2014, Guy submitted a second internal appeal. On this occasion,\nhis appeal was handled by Department Director, Robert Lampert. Guy sought to have\nWarden Hargett punished for the alleged WPRA violation stating: “Discipline him or I\nwill ask a Judge to do so.” Director Lampert reviewed Guy’s appeal and ultimately\ndenied the request for a remedy. Director Lampert indicated that at the time the Code of\nEthics had been requested, it had not been reviewed for public dissemination consistent\nwith the allowances within the WPRA. He further stated that Guy had been allowed to\nview the policy once the DOC had conducted the necessary review, so no further action\n\n                                           2\n\fneeded to be taken. On October 15, 2014, Guy sent a letter to Director Lampert in\nresponse to his denial of Guy’s grievance. Guy once again threatened legal action if his\n“requested remedies [were not] satisfied in full.” On October 22, 2014, Director Lampert\nreplied to Guy’s letter, but he did not reconsider his position on the alleged violation of\nthe WPRA.\n\n[¶8] On November 7, 2014, Guy filed his petition for declaratory judgment, naming\nDirector Lampert and Warden Hargett as respondents. Guy alleged that Warden Hargett\nhad violated the WPRA by initially denying his public records request. The petition\nstated that the suit was being brought pursuant to the WPRA, but the jurisdictional\nstatement also stated that the district court had authority to grant a declaratory judgment\npursuant to W.R.C.P. 57 and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (“UDJA”), Wyo.\nStat. Ann. § 1-37-102 and 103 (LexisNexis 2015). Guy asked for the following forms of\nrelief:\n\n             36. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Ordering that\n             WDOC policy is subject to the WPRA, that the term\n             “reviewed in light of public dissemination” does not fall\n             within one of the statutory exceptions for nondisclosure of a\n             public record, that in withdrawing a record a custodian is\n             required to petition the District Court for permission to\n             withhold the record and may not blanket-block any class of\n             records, that a custodian denying a public record must state to\n             the applicant requesting the record his legal reason/s for\n             nondisclosure.\n\n             37. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Decreeing that\n             defendant Hargett’s decision to withhold the record in\n             contention because he believed WDOC policy is not subject\n             to the WPRA or because he doesn’t decide what WDOC\n             policies are available for inmate review is contrary to law.\n\n             38. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Decreeing that in\n             violating the WPRA and misapplying the law, defendants\n             have violated Petitioner’s constitutional rights.\n\n             39. Petitioner seeks an injunction Ordering defendants to\n             take the most efficacious method to effect training on public\n             records dissemination amongst themselves and their staff, or\n             to otherwise educate themselves in matters concerning the\n             same.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f             40. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Decreeing that the\n             term “Approved for Inmate Distribution” as used to segregate\n             WDOC policy is contrary to the WPRA.\n\n             41. Petitioner seeks an injunction Ordering the defendants to\n             revise any and all WDOC policy or Operational Procedure\n             which may be in any way contrary to the intent of the WPRA.\n\n             42. Petitioner seeks an injunction Permanently Enjoining\n             the WDOC, its agents and/or representatives, from violating\n             the timelines delineated by the WPRA without just cause,\n             under strict threat of the civil penalty delineated by W.S. §\n             16-4-205 to be paid out of a violator’s personal monies.\n             Petitioner states that it is necessary for a violator to pay the\n             penalty out of his personal monies and not be indemnified by\n             his agency as it would be highly counterintuitive to use State\n             funds to repay the State for a violation of its laws.\n\n             43. Petitioner seeks compensation for any and all costs\n             inherent to this action. Such costs shall include but shall not\n             be limited to compensation for all cost incurred for service\n             and process, copies, time spent, postage, filing fee(s), and the\n             like.\n\n             44. Petitioner seeks such other relief to which it may appear\n             to this Court is just and proper. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n[¶9] On January 12, 2015, Appellees moved to dismiss Guy’s petition, on the grounds\nthat the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, because the remedies set forth in the\nWPRA did not include the relief that Guy was seeking. The Appellees alleged that the\nWPRA only allows an applicant, like Guy, to bring the custodian of a requested record\nbefore the district court to explain a delay in producing a record or to show cause why the\nrecords request was denied. The Appellees further argued that, because Guy had\nultimately been able to review the Code of Ethics, the WPRA did not afford him any\nremedies.\n\n[¶10] On January 22, 2015, Guy filed a motion to amend his petition along with a\nproposed amended petition. Guy wished to amend his petition to clarify that it was\nbrought under the UDJA, Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 1-37-101 through 1-37-115 (LexisNexis\n2015). He also added a paragraph to the jurisdictional statement alleging that his claims\nfor injunctive relief were authorized by W.R.C.P. 65 and Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-28-102\n(LexisNexis 2015). Other than these two changes, the proposed amended petition was\nidentical to the original petition in all material respects.\n\n                                            4\n\f[¶11] On January 30, 2015, the district court signed an order dismissing the petition.\nThe district court found that the WPRA defined Guy’s right to access public records, as\nwell as the remedies that were available to him if this access was denied. The court also\nfound that Guy did not pursue the remedies that were available to him under the WPRA;\ninstead, Guy attempted to resolve the issue through the DOC’s internal grievance process,\nand the requested record was eventually produced for his review. The court concluded\nthat the WPRA:\n\n               provides for relief only when access to the public record is\n               denied or when the custodian delays responding to the\n               applicant for a reason the applicant believes is not good\n               cause. . . . [T]he Act does not provide relief for an applicant\n               who is unhappy with how an agency granted his public\n               records application, and it most definitely does not provide\n               for relief by declaratory judgment or monetary damages.\n\nThe district court ultimately found that it did not have jurisdiction under the WPRA to\nprovide the relief Guy was seeking, and it granted the motion to dismiss without\nexpressly ruling on the motion to amend.2 This appeal followed.\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[¶12] We review motions to dismiss pursuant to W.R.C.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6)\nsimilarly. Our review is de novo, and we employ the same standards and examine the\nsame materials as the district court: we accept the facts alleged in the complaint or\npetition as true and view them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\nHowever, liberal construction of the pleadings does not “excuse omission of that which is\nmaterial and necessary in order to entitle [one to] relief.” William F. West Ranch, LLC v.\nTyrrell, 2009 WY 62, ¶ 9, 206 P.3d 722, 726 (Wyo. 2009) (alteration in original)\n(quoting Martinez v. Associates Fin. Servs. Co., 891 P.2d 785, 790 (Wyo. 1995)).\n\n\n\n\n2\n  Apparently unaware that the district court had dismissed the petition, both sides continued to file\npleadings relating to the motion to amend. On February 2, 2015, after the district court had granted the\nmotion to dismiss, Appellees filed their opposition to the proposed amendment. They argued that the\namendment would be unnecessary and futile, because the requested relief was not available under the\nWPRA, and bringing the petition under the UDJA could not fix this fatal flaw. They also argued that a\ndeclaratory judgment action was not appropriate, because Guy’s proposed amended petition did not\npresent a justiciable controversy. On February 10, 2015, Guy filed his response to the Appellees’\nopposition to his motion to amend. He argued that the proposed amendment would fix the jurisdictional\nissue. He also asserted that he had pled sufficient facts and presented the court with a justiciable\ncontroversy that was appropriate for a declaratory judgment action.\n                                                   5\n\f[¶13] Under W.R.C.P. 12(b)(1), we affirm dismissal only if those facts dictate judgment\nfor the appellee as a matter of law. Cantrell v. Sweetwater County Sch. Dist. No. 2, 2006\nWY 57, ¶ 4, 133 P.3d 983, 984 (Wyo. 2006). Likewise, under W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6),\ndismissal is appropriate only if it is certain on the face of the complaint that the plaintiff\ncannot assert any facts that create entitlement to relief. Swinney v. Jones, 2008 WY 150,\n¶ 6, 199 P.3d 512, 515 (Wyo. 2008) (citing Dowlin v. Dowlin, 2007 WY 114, ¶ 6, 162\nP.3d 1202, 1204 (Wyo. 2007)).\n\n[¶14] The district court’s decision to deny a motion to amend is reviewed for an abuse of\ndiscretion, and it will be reversed only for an abuse of discretion shown by clear\nevidence. Ekberg v. Sharp, 2003 WY 123, ¶ 9, 76 P.3d 1250, 1253 (Wyo. 2003).\n“Judicial discretion is a composite of many things, among which are conclusions drawn\nfrom objective criteria; it means exercising sound judgment with regard to what is right\nunder the circumstances and without doing so arbitrarily or capriciously.” Selvey v.\nSelvey, 2004 WY 166, ¶ 15, 102 P.3d 210, 214 (Wyo. 2004). We have previously held\nthat:\n\n                     A court abuses its discretion only when it acts in a\n                     manner which exceeds the bounds of reason under the\n                     circumstances. The burden is placed upon the party\n                     who is attacking the trial court’s ruling to establish an\n                     abuse of discretion, and the ultimate issue is whether\n                     the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\n\nCline v. Rocky Mountain, Inc., 998 P.2d 946, 951 (Wyo. 2000) (quoting Johnston v.\nStephenson, 938 P.2d 861, 862 (Wyo. 1997)).\n\n[¶15] This case also involves the interpretation of the WPRA and the UDJA. The\nstandard of review applicable to statutory language is well established:\n\n                     “Questions of statutory interpretation are matters of\n                     law.” Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Dep’t of Revenue, 2007\n                     WY 43, ¶ [9], 154 P.3d 331, 334 (Wyo. 2007), citing\n                     Powder River Coal Co. v. Wyo. Dept. of Revenue,\n                     2006 WY 137, ¶ 9, 145 P.3d 442, 446 (Wyo. 2006). In\n                     interpreting statutes, our task is to give effect to the\n                     legislature’s intent. We look first to the plain meaning\n                     of the language chosen by the legislature and apply\n                     that meaning if the language is clear and unambiguous.\n                     “A statute is clear and unambiguous if its wording is\n                     such that reasonable persons are able to agree on its\n                     meaning with consistency and predictability.” RME\n\n\n                                              6\n\f                     Petroleum Co. v. Wyo. Dep’t of Revenue, 2007 WY\n                     16, ¶ 25, 150 P.3d 673, 683 (Wyo. 2007).\n\nBangs v. Schroth, 2009 WY 20, ¶ 32, 201 P.3d 442, 456 (Wyo. 2009). We will not\n“enlarge, stretch, expand, or extend a statute to matters that do not fall within its express\nprovisions.” Redco Constr. v. Profile Prop., LLC, 2012 WY 24, ¶ 26, 271 P.3d 408, 416\n(Wyo. 2012) (quoting Cheyenne Newspapers, Inc. v. Bldg. Code Bd. of Appeals, 2010\nWY 2, ¶ 9, 222 P.3d 158, 162 (Wyo. 2010)). In addition, we have long held that:\n\n              The omission of words from a statute must be considered\n              intentional on the part of the legislature. Words may not be\n              supplied in a statute where the statute is intelligible without\n              the addition of the alleged omission. Words may not be\n              inserted in a statutory provision under the guise of\n              interpretation. The Supreme Court will not read into laws\n              what is not there. This court will not supply omissions in a\n              statute and redress is with the legislature. We are alerted by\n              all this to the result that it is just as important to recognize\n              what a statute does not say as it is to recognize what it does\n              say.\n\nAdoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, 485 (Wyo. 1976) (internal citations omitted).\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n   A. Granting the Motion to Dismiss\n\n[¶16] The Appellees moved to dismiss the petition under both W.R.C.P. 12(b)(1), lack\nof subject matter jurisdiction, and W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6), failure to state a claim on which\nrelief can be granted. When granting the motion to dismiss, the district court stated: “this\nCourt has no authority to grant relief to Guy on his Petition for Declaratory Judgment and\nat (sic) the Respondent’s Motion to Dismiss is hereby granted . . . .” We may affirm the\ndecision to dismiss the petition “on any legal ground appearing in the record.” Daniels v.\nCarpenter, 2003 WY 11, ¶ 30, 62 P.3d 555, 566 (Wyo. 2003) (citing Litzenberger v.\nMerge, 698 P.2d 1152, 1153 (Wyo. 1985); Mentock v. Mentock, 638 P.2d 156, 159 (Wyo.\n1981)).\n\n[¶17] A citizen’s right to access public records is set out in Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 16-4-202\n(LexisNexis 2015), which reads:\n\n              (a) All public records shall be open for inspection by any\n              person at reasonable times, during business hours of the state\n              entity or political subdivision, except as provided in this act\n\n                                             7\n\for as otherwise provided by law, but the official custodian of\nany public records may make rules and regulations with\nreference to the inspection of the records as is reasonably\nnecessary for the protection of the records and the prevention\nof unnecessary interference with the regular discharge of the\nduties of the custodian or his office.\n\n(b) If the public records requested are not in the custody or\ncontrol of the person to whom application is made, the\ncustodian or authorized person having personal custody and\ncontrol of the public records shall notify the applicant within\nseven (7) business days from the date of acknowledged\nreceipt of the request of the unavailability of the records\nsought, unless good cause exists preventing a response within\nsuch time period. In the event the applicant is not satisfied\nthat good cause exists, the applicant may petition the district\ncourt for a determination as to whether the custodian has\ndemonstrated good cause existed.\n\n(c) If the public records requested are in the custody and\ncontrol of the person to whom application is made but are in\nactive use or in storage, and therefore not available at the time\nan applicant asks to examine them, the custodian or\nauthorized person having personal custody and control of the\npublic records shall notify the applicant of this situation\nwithin seven (7) business days from the date of acknowledged\nreceipt of the request, unless good cause exists preventing a\nresponse within such time period. In the event the applicant is\nnot satisfied that good cause exists, the applicant may petition\nthe district court for a determination as to whether the\ncustodian has demonstrated good cause existed. If a public\nrecord is readily available, it shall be released immediately to\nthe applicant so long as the release does not impair or impede\nthe agency’s ability to discharge its other duties.\n\n(d) If a public record exists primarily or solely in an\nelectronic format, the custodian of the record shall so inform\nthe requester. Electronic record inspection and copying shall\nbe subject to the following:\n\n       (i) The reasonable costs of producing a copy of the\n       public record shall be borne by the party making the\n       request. The costs may include the cost of producing a\n\n                               8\n\f                    copy of the public record and the cost of constructing\n                    the record, including the cost of programming and\n                    computer services;\n\n                    (ii) An agency shall provide an electronic record in\n                    alternative formats unless doing so is impractical or\n                    impossible;\n\n                    (iii) An agency shall not be required to compile data,\n                    extract data or create a new document to comply with\n                    an electronic record request if doing so would impair\n                    the agency’s ability to discharge its duties;\n\n                    (iv) An agency shall not be required to allow\n                    inspection or copying of a record in its electronic\n                    format if doing so would jeopardize or compromise the\n                    security or integrity of the original record or of any\n                    proprietary software in which it is maintained;\n\n                    (v) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the director of\n                    the office of homeland security from enacting any\n                    rules pursuant to his authority under W.S. 19-13-\n                    104(d)(v).\n\nThe WPRA also specifically exempts certain classes of records from inspection, sets out\na procedure that allows the custodian to conduct a review of the requested record to make\nsure that disclosure of the contents of the record would not do substantial injury to the\npublic interest, and sets forth a process by which the custodian can request permission to\ndeny the request. In addition, “[t]he legislature anticipated that records custodians and\nthe public would at times disagree as to whether information was subject to inspection\nunder the Act, and specified a procedure to resolve those conflicts in the district court.”\nPowder River Basin Res. Council v. Wyo. Oil & Gas Conservation Comm’n, 2014 WY\n37, ¶ 22, 320 P.3d 222, 229 (Wyo. 2014). These procedures are set forth in Wyo. Stat.\nAnn. § 16-4-203 (LexisNexis 2015), which provides in relevant part:\n\n             (a) The custodian of any public records shall allow any\n             person the right of inspection of the records or any portion\n             thereof except on one (1) or more of the following grounds or\n             as provided in subsection (b) or (d) of this section:\n\n                    (i) The inspection would be contrary to any state\n                    statute;\n\n\n                                            9\n\f                    (ii) The inspection would be contrary to any federal\n                    statute or regulation issued thereunder having the force\n                    and effect of law; or\n\n                    (iii) The inspection is prohibited by rules promulgated\n                    by the supreme court or by the order of any court of\n                    record.\n\n             ....\n\n             (e) If the custodian denies access to any public record, the\n             applicant may request a written statement of the grounds for\n             the denial. The statement shall cite the law or regulation\n             under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the\n             applicant.\n\n             (f) Any person denied the right to inspect any record covered\n             by this act may apply to the district court of the district\n             wherein the record is found for an order directing the\n             custodian of the record to show cause why he should not\n             permit the inspection of the record.\n\n             (g) If, in the opinion of the official custodian of any public\n             record, disclosure of the contents of the record would do\n             substantial injury to the public interest, notwithstanding the\n             fact that the record might otherwise be available to public\n             inspection, he may apply to the district court of the district in\n             which the record is located for an order permitting him to\n             restrict disclosure. After hearing, the court may issue an order\n             upon a finding that disclosure would cause substantial injury\n             to the public interest. The person seeking permission to\n             examine the record shall have notice of the hearing served\n             upon him in the manner provided for service of process by the\n             Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure and has the right to\n             appear and be heard.\n\n[¶18] A review of this statute and case law makes clear that the WPRA “set[s] out the\nremedies available to one denied access to a public record.” Allsop v. Cheyenne\nNewspapers, Inc., 2002 WY 22, ¶ 18, 39 P.3d 1092, 1097 (Wyo. 2002) (emphasis\nadded). When his request was initially denied, Guy could have requested a written\nstatement of the grounds for the denial which cited the law or regulation under which the\naccess was denied, or he could have applied to the district court for an order directing\nWarden Hargett to show cause why the record could not be inspected. He chose not to\n\n                                            10\n\fpursue either of these remedies and instead attempted to resolve the issue through the\nprison’s internal grievance process. 3 Similarly, when Deputy Director Lindly did not\nrespond to his request within seven (7) days, Guy could have petitioned the district court\nfor a determination as to whether Deputy Director Lindly had demonstrated that good\ncause existed for the delay. Guy did not pursue this remedy either, and he took no further\naction on the request he sent to Deputy Director Lindly.\n\n[¶19] A review of the statute also makes clear that the WPRA does not authorize the\ndistrict court to order the DOC to revise its policies or require its staff to be trained on the\napplication of the WPRA, nor does it authorize the imposition of monetary sanctions\nthrough a private suit.4 This Court will not read remedies into a statute that were not put\nthere by the legislature. Because Guy was ultimately, albeit belatedly, granted access to\nthe record, the WPRA does not afford him any remedies.\n\n[¶20] In addition, Guy’s petition asked the district court to declare that a certain class of\nrecords, which he titled “WDOC policy,” was subject to the WPRA, even though he had\nnot yet filed any requests to inspect those records. Guy’s brief asserts that he filed suit\nbecause he was seeking to “ensure similar unlawful denials did not transpire.” The\nWPRA does not grant the district court the authority to rule on records requests that have\nnot yet been made. The statute specifically allows a custodian to review the records\nbefore releasing them, and it provides the custodians with a procedure for denying the\nrequest.5 Because the WPRA contains these procedures, a district court cannot\nprospectively declare that a class of records that may be requested sometime in the future\nwill be subject to the WPRA and must be produced upon demand. Courts “ordinarily\nwill not decide as to future or contingent rights, but will wait until the event giving rise to\nrights has happened, or, in other words, until rights have become fixed under an existing\nstate of facts.” Anderson v. Wyo. Dev. Co., 154 P.2d 318, 335 (Wyo. 1944). Because\n\n3\n  We have previously held that “[p]roceedings to challenge denial of access to documents claimed to be\npublic must follow procedures established by the WPRA . . . .” Powder River Basin Res. Council, 2014\nWY 37, ¶ 28, 320 P.3d at 230. In Powder River, the appellants had been denied access to records they\nbelieved to be subject to the WPRA. Instead of bringing a motion for an order to show cause, they filed a\npetition for review of administrative action and a complaint for declaratory judgment. We held that the\nappellants had to follow the procedures set forth in the WPRA, and they could not force the disclosure of\nthe records under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n4\n  The Court notes that Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 16-4-205 does provide that a person who knowingly and\nintentionally violates the WPRA is liable for a penalty not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars\n($750.00). However, this penalty can only be recovered in a civil action initiated by the attorney general\nor the appropriate county attorney. It cannot be recovered in a civil suit brought by a private citizen like\nGuy.\n5\n  The Court notes that apparently neither Warden Hargett nor Deputy Director Lindly followed this\nprocedure. However, because the record was ultimately produced, the WPRA does not provide any\nremedies for the delayed production of the document.\n                                                    11\n\fGuy was asking the district court to rule on requests that he might make in the future, the\nWPRA did not give the district court the authority to grant the requested relief.\n\n[¶21] For these reasons, the district court correctly concluded that the Appellees were\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law and that Guy could not have asserted any set of\nfacts that created an entitlement to relief, and it was proper for the district court to\ndismiss the petition.\n\n   B. Denial of the Motion to Amend\n\n[¶22] Although the district court did not expressly rule on Guy’s motion to amend\nbefore dismissing the petition, we can assume that the judge intended to deny the motion.\nSee Jasper v. Brinckerhoff, 2008 WY 32, ¶ 8, 179 P.3d 857, 862 (Wyo. 2008). We must\ndetermine if it was an abuse of discretion to implicitly deny the motion.\n\n[¶23] Amendment of the pleadings is governed by W.R.C.P. 15(a), which states that\nleave to amend “shall be freely given when justice so requires.” We have held that the\n\n              “proper test as to what the trial court should consider when an\n              amendment is proffered” to be the following:\n\n                     “* * * * If the underlying facts or circumstances relied\n                     upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he\n                     ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on\n                     the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared\n                     reason—such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory\n                     motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to\n                     cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed,\n                     undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of\n                     allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment,\n                     etc.—the leave sought should, as the rules require, be\n                     ‘freely given.’ * * *”\n\nArmstrong v. Hrabal, 2004 WY 39, ¶ 11, 87 P.3d 1226, 1230-31 (Wyo. 2004) (quoting\nBeaudoin v. Taylor, 492 P.2d 966, 970 (Wyo. 1972)) (emphasis added).\n\n[¶24] In this case, Guy’s proposed amendment made only two material changes: 1) it\nchanged the jurisdictional paragraph to reflect that his petition was brought under the\nUDJA, not the WPRA; and 2) he added a paragraph to the jurisdictional statement\nalleging that his claims for injunctive relief were authorized by W.R.C.P. 65 and Wyo.\nStat. Ann. § 1-28-102 (LexisNexis 2015). We must determine if these changes would\nhave fixed the flaws in Guy’s petition.\n\n\n                                            12\n\f[¶25] Guy’s proposed amendment stated that the petition was brought under the UDJA,\nWyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-37-101 et seq. (LexisNexis 2015). A party’s right to have a\ndetermination made under the Act is set forth in Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-37-103 (LexisNexis\n2015), which provides:\n\n             Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract or\n             other writings constituting a contract, or whose rights, status\n             or other legal relations are affected by the Wyoming\n             constitution or by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract or\n             franchise, may have any question of construction or validity\n             arising under the instrument determined and obtain a\n             declaration of rights, status or other legal relations.\n\n[¶26] While the UDJA does allow a district court to declare a party’s rights under a\nstatute, we have previously held:\n\n             [t]he Declaratory Judgments Act does not, however, extend\n             the jurisdiction of the courts. . . . Thus, under the relevant\n             statutes, in order for a court to have jurisdiction over a\n             declaratory judgment action, the “right” to be declared must\n             fall within the scope of the act and the plaintiff must be an\n             “interested” person.\n\nWilliam F. West Ranch, LLC, ¶ 11, 206 P.3d at 726-27 (citing Cox v. City of Cheyenne,\n2003 WY 146, ¶ 8, 79 P.3d 500, 505 (Wyo. 2003)). As discussed above, the “rights” that\nGuy sought to have declared do not fall within the scope of the WPRA. Because the\nUDJA does not extend the jurisdiction of the district court beyond the scope of the\nunderlying statute, the proposed amendment would not have fixed the petition’s fatal\nflaw.\n\n[¶27] In addition, we have consistently held that there must be a justiciable controversy\nbefore relief can be granted under the UDJA. This Court has adopted a four part test to\ndetermine whether a justiciable controversy exists:\n\n             1. The parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished\n             from theoretical, rights or interests.\n\n             2. The controversy must be one upon which the judgment of\n             the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a\n             debate or argument evoking a purely political, administrative,\n             philosophical or academic conclusion.\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f              3. It must be a controversy the judicial determination of\n              which will have the force and effect of a final judgment in\n              law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or other legal\n              relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or,\n              wanting these qualities to be of such great and overriding\n              public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of\n              them.\n\n              4. The proceedings must be genuinely adversary in character\n              and not a mere disputation, but advanced with sufficient\n              militancy to engender a thorough research and analysis of the\n              major issues.\n\nWilliam F. West Ranch, LLC, ¶ 12, 206 P.3d at 727 (quoting Cox, ¶ 10, 79 P.3d at 505).\nOur precedents provide guidance on how these factors should be applied. We have long\nrecognized that the Declaratory Judgments Act gives the courts no power to determine\nfuture rights or anticipated disputes or controversies and must treat them as existing and\ngenuine. Cranston v. Thomson, 530 P.2d 726, 728-29 (Wyo. 1975); see also Anderson,\n154 P.2d at 335 (“The [Declaratory Judgments Act] does not require courts to render\nadvisory opinions or to determine moot or theoretical questions.”). As discussed above,\nGuy’s petition asked the district court to declare that a certain class of records would be\nsubject to disclosure in the future, even though he had not yet made an actual request to\ninspect these records. Therefore, he was attempting to have the district court determine\nhis future rights and render an advisory opinion. This was not the proper subject of a\ndeclaratory judgment action.\n\n[¶28] Similarly, we have held that “in order for a declaratory judgment to lie, it must be\nbased upon an actual and existing disagreement.” William F. West Ranch, LLC, ¶ 18,\n206 P.3d at 728 (citing Anderson, 154 P.2d at 341–42). Guy’s petition was based on a\npast disagreement, which had been resolved when the record was produced. Guy also\nsought resolution of anticipated future disagreements. Because the petition was not based\non an “actual and existing disagreement,” it was not the proper subject of a declaratory\njudgment action.\n\n[¶29] Finally, Guy’s petition also sought a declaration that Warden Hargett had violated\nthe WPRA, and he asked the district court to enjoin future violations of the act. This type\nof relief is not available through a declaratory judgment action. We discussed a similar\nsituation in Bird v. Rozier, 948 P.2d 888, 892-93 (Wyo. 1997). In that case, Bird\nrequested a declaratory order setting forth that the appellees had a legal, moral and/or\nethical duty to abide by or uphold and enforce the laws of Wyoming and that they\nviolated their duty. We held that although the UDJA authorizes Wyoming courts to\ndeclare the rights, status or other legal relations of parties, the court may refuse to render\na declaratory judgment where the judgment would not terminate the uncertainty or\n\n                                             14\n\fcontroversy at issue. Id. at 892 (citing Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-37-108). We found that Bird\nhad not made a showing that he was entitled to declaratory relief, because “[g]iving or\nrefusing the relief requested in his complaint–a declaration that appellees violated a legal\nduty to abide by the law, enforce the law, or uphold the law–would have no effect upon\nthe rights, status or legal relationship of Bird and appellees.” Bird, 948 P.2d at 893. We\nstated: “In this case, a judgment would have no practical effect on the litigants and would\nserve no useful purpose.” Id. The same reasoning applies in this case. A declaration that\nthe Appellees had violated the WPRA and were enjoined from violating the act in the\nfuture would have no effect on the rights, status or legal relationship of Guy and the\nAppellees and would serve no useful purpose. Thus, his claim was not the proper subject\nof a declaratory judgment action, and granting the proposed amendment would not have\nallowed Guy to state a set of facts upon which relief could be granted.\n\n[¶30] For these reasons, the district court could have reasonably concluded that the\nmotion to amend should be denied, because the proposed amendment was futile.\nTherefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to implicitly deny the\nmotion to amend.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n[¶31] The relief Guy sought was not available under the WPRA, and the district court\ncorrectly found that Appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Guy did not\nassert any set of facts that created an entitlement to relief. Therefore, it was proper to\ndismiss Guy’s petition. In addition, Guy’s proposed amendment was futile, because it\ndid not fix the petition’s fundamental flaws. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for\nthe district court to implicitly deny the motion to amend.\n\n[¶32] Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f",

He also asked the\ndistrict court to declare that the Department of Corrections (“DOC”) had to produce\ncertain types of records if he requested them in the future, and he asked for an order\nrequiring the staff of the DOC to be trained on the application of the WPRA. The\nAppellees filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the district court lacked subject\nmatter jurisdiction, or the petition failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. Guy then filed a motion to amend his petition. The district court dismissed the\npetition without ruling on Guy’s motion to amend. This appeal followed. We affirm.\n\n                                              ISSUES\n\n[¶2]   Appellant phrases the issues as follows:\n\n               1. Did the district court abuse its discretion when it denied\n                  Mr. Guy leave to amend his pleading?\n\n               2. Did the district court abuse its discretion when it granted\n                  Appellee’s (sic) motion to dismiss?\n\n[¶3]   Appellees phrase the issues as follows:\n\n               1. Wyoming Rule of Civil Procedure 12 allows a district\n                  court to dismiss a case when the court lacks subject matter\n                  jurisdiction or when a complaint fails to state a claim on\n                  which relief can be granted. JonMichael Guy’s request to\n                  view a record under the Wyoming Public Records Act was\n                  granted, but he petitioned the district court for additional\n                  relief. Did the district court err by dismissing Guy’s\n                  petition?\n\n               2. After a responsive pleading has been filed by the\n                  defendant, a plaintiff may amend a complaint only after\n                  receiving permission from the court. Guy sought to\n                  amend his petition to include citations to the Uniform\n                  Declaratory Judgments Act even though his claims did not\n\n1\n The original caption for this case incorrectly identified the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution\nWarden as Donald Hargett instead of Steve Hargett.\n                                                  1\n\f                meet its justifiability (sic) requirements. Did the district\n                court abuse its discretion by dismissing his petition\n                without allowing the amendment?\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n[¶4] Guy is an inmate at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution. On June 22,\n2014, he sent an internal inmate communication form to Steve Hargett, the warden of the\nWyoming Medium Correctional Institution, requesting permission to view the DOC’s\nPolicy and Procedure #1.215, Code of Ethics. On June 23, 2014, Warden Hargett denied\nthe request on the grounds that the Code of Ethics had not been preapproved for inmate\nreview. Later that day, Guy resubmitted his request, this time stating that it had been\nfiled under the WPRA. Guy also sent a similar request to Steve Lindly, the Deputy\nDirector of the DOC. On June 24, 2014, Warden Hargett denied Guy’s request and\ninformed Guy that he was not the person who determined which policies and procedures\nwere available for inmate review, and he did not believe the WPRA applied to the DOC’s\npolicies and procedures. Guy took no further action at that time.\n\n[¶5] On July 14, 2014, Deputy Director Lindly responded to Guy’s June 23, 2014,\nrequest. He explained that while the request had initially been denied, the DOC had\nundertaken further review of the requested policy, had determined that it was a public\nrecord, and Guy should be allowed to view it. Arrangements were made for Guy to view\nthe policy in the prison library a few days later.\n\n[¶6] On July 18, 2014, Guy filed a grievance against Warden Hargett via the DOC’s\ninternal inmate grievance process. Guy alleged that Warden Hargett had unlawfully\ndenied Guy’s public records request. As a remedy for his grievance, Guy requested that\nWarden Hargett receive training on the WPRA and pay a $750.00 fine. Guy’s grievance\nwas reviewed by Grievance Manager, Sergeant Shawn Hobson, who concluded that the\nmatter had been resolved because Guy had been allowed to review the requested record.\nGuy used the prison’s internal process to appeal Grievance Manager Hobson’s decision.\nThe internal appeal was handled by the Department Prison Division Administrator, Dan\nShannon, who likewise determined that no violation of the WPRA had transpired,\nbecause Guy had been given access to the requested record.\n\n[¶7] On September 5, 2014, Guy submitted a second internal appeal. On this occasion,\nhis appeal was handled by Department Director, Robert Lampert. Guy sought to have\nWarden Hargett punished for the alleged WPRA violation stating: “Discipline him or I\nwill ask a Judge to do so.” Director Lampert reviewed Guy’s appeal and ultimately\ndenied the request for a remedy. Director Lampert indicated that at the time the Code of\nEthics had been requested, it had not been reviewed for public dissemination consistent\nwith the allowances within the WPRA. He further stated that Guy had been allowed to\nview the policy once the DOC had conducted the necessary review, so no further action\n\n                                           2\n\fneeded to be taken. On October 15, 2014, Guy sent a letter to Director Lampert in\nresponse to his denial of Guy’s grievance. Guy once again threatened legal action if his\n“requested remedies [were not] satisfied in full.” On October 22, 2014, Director Lampert\nreplied to Guy’s letter, but he did not reconsider his position on the alleged violation of\nthe WPRA.\n\n[¶8] On November 7, 2014, Guy filed his petition for declaratory judgment, naming\nDirector Lampert and Warden Hargett as respondents. Guy alleged that Warden Hargett\nhad violated the WPRA by initially denying his public records request. The petition\nstated that the suit was being brought pursuant to the WPRA, but the jurisdictional\nstatement also stated that the district court had authority to grant a declaratory judgment\npursuant to W.R.C.P. 57 and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (“UDJA”), Wyo.\nStat. Ann. § 1-37-102 and 103 (LexisNexis 2015). Guy asked for the following forms of\nrelief:\n\n             36. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Ordering that\n             WDOC policy is subject to the WPRA, that the term\n             “reviewed in light of public dissemination” does not fall\n             within one of the statutory exceptions for nondisclosure of a\n             public record, that in withdrawing a record a custodian is\n             required to petition the District Court for permission to\n             withhold the record and may not blanket-block any class of\n             records, that a custodian denying a public record must state to\n             the applicant requesting the record his legal reason/s for\n             nondisclosure.\n\n             37. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Decreeing that\n             defendant Hargett’s decision to withhold the record in\n             contention because he believed WDOC policy is not subject\n             to the WPRA or because he doesn’t decide what WDOC\n             policies are available for inmate review is contrary to law.\n\n             38. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Decreeing that in\n             violating the WPRA and misapplying the law, defendants\n             have violated Petitioner’s constitutional rights.\n\n             39. Petitioner seeks an injunction Ordering defendants to\n             take the most efficacious method to effect training on public\n             records dissemination amongst themselves and their staff, or\n             to otherwise educate themselves in matters concerning the\n             same.\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f             40. Petitioner seeks declaratory judgment Decreeing that the\n             term “Approved for Inmate Distribution” as used to segregate\n             WDOC policy is contrary to the WPRA.\n\n             41. Petitioner seeks an injunction Ordering the defendants to\n             revise any and all WDOC policy or Operational Procedure\n             which may be in any way contrary to the intent of the WPRA.\n\n             42. Petitioner seeks an injunction Permanently Enjoining\n             the WDOC, its agents and/or representatives, from violating\n             the timelines delineated by the WPRA without just cause,\n             under strict threat of the civil penalty delineated by W.S. §\n             16-4-205 to be paid out of a violator’s personal monies.\n             Petitioner states that it is necessary for a violator to pay the\n             penalty out of his personal monies and not be indemnified by\n             his agency as it would be highly counterintuitive to use State\n             funds to repay the State for a violation of its laws.\n\n             43. Petitioner seeks compensation for any and all costs\n             inherent to this action. Such costs shall include but shall not\n             be limited to compensation for all cost incurred for service\n             and process, copies, time spent, postage, filing fee(s), and the\n             like.\n\n             44. Petitioner seeks such other relief to which it may appear\n             to this Court is just and proper. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n[¶9] On January 12, 2015, Appellees moved to dismiss Guy’s petition, on the grounds\nthat the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, because the remedies set forth in the\nWPRA did not include the relief that Guy was seeking. The Appellees alleged that the\nWPRA only allows an applicant, like Guy, to bring the custodian of a requested record\nbefore the district court to explain a delay in producing a record or to show cause why the\nrecords request was denied. The Appellees further argued that, because Guy had\nultimately been able to review the Code of Ethics, the WPRA did not afford him any\nremedies.\n\n[¶10] On January 22, 2015, Guy filed a motion to amend his petition along with a\nproposed amended petition. Guy wished to amend his petition to clarify that it was\nbrought under the UDJA, Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 1-37-101 through 1-37-115 (LexisNexis\n2015). He also added a paragraph to the jurisdictional statement alleging that his claims\nfor injunctive relief were authorized by W.R.C.P. 65 and Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-28-102\n(LexisNexis 2015). Other than these two changes, the proposed amended petition was\nidentical to the original petition in all material respects.\n\n                                            4\n\f[¶11] On January 30, 2015, the district court signed an order dismissing the petition.\nThe district court found that the WPRA defined Guy’s right to access public records, as\nwell as the remedies that were available to him if this access was denied. The court also\nfound that Guy did not pursue the remedies that were available to him under the WPRA;\ninstead, Guy attempted to resolve the issue through the DOC’s internal grievance process,\nand the requested record was eventually produced for his review. The court concluded\nthat the WPRA:\n\n               provides for relief only when access to the public record is\n               denied or when the custodian delays responding to the\n               applicant for a reason the applicant believes is not good\n               cause. . . . [T]he Act does not provide relief for an applicant\n               who is unhappy with how an agency granted his public\n               records application, and it most definitely does not provide\n               for relief by declaratory judgment or monetary damages.\n\nThe district court ultimately found that it did not have jurisdiction under the WPRA to\nprovide the relief Guy was seeking, and it granted the motion to dismiss without\nexpressly ruling on the motion to amend.2 This appeal followed.\n\n                                   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n[¶12] We review motions to dismiss pursuant to W.R.C.P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6)\nsimilarly. Our review is de novo, and we employ the same standards and examine the\nsame materials as the district court: we accept the facts alleged in the complaint or\npetition as true and view them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\nHowever, liberal construction of the pleadings does not “excuse omission of that which is\nmaterial and necessary in order to entitle [one to] relief.” William F.

On February 2, 2015, after the district court had granted the\nmotion to dismiss, Appellees filed their opposition to the proposed amendment. They argued that the\namendment would be unnecessary and futile, because the requested relief was not available under the\nWPRA, and bringing the petition under the UDJA could not fix this fatal flaw. They also argued that a\ndeclaratory judgment action was not appropriate, because Guy’s proposed amended petition did not\npresent a justiciable controversy. On February 10, 2015, Guy filed his response to the Appellees’\nopposition to his motion to amend. He argued that the proposed amendment would fix the jurisdictional\nissue. He also asserted that he had pled sufficient facts and presented the court with a justiciable\ncontroversy that was appropriate for a declaratory judgment action.\n                                                   5\n\f[¶13] Under W.R.C.P. 12(b)(1), we affirm dismissal only if those facts dictate judgment\nfor the appellee as a matter of law.

The statement shall cite the law or regulation\n             under which access is denied and shall be furnished to the\n             applicant.\n\n             (f) Any person denied the right to inspect any record covered\n             by this act may apply to the district court of the district\n             wherein the record is found for an order directing the\n             custodian of the record to show cause why he should not\n             permit the inspection of the record.\n\n             (g) If, in the opinion of the official custodian of any public\n             record, disclosure of the contents of the record would do\n             substantial injury to the public interest, notwithstanding the\n             fact that the record might otherwise be available to public\n             inspection, he may apply to the district court of the district in\n             which the record is located for an order permitting him to\n             restrict disclosure. After hearing, the court may issue an order\n             upon a finding that disclosure would cause substantial injury\n             to the public interest.

When his request was initially denied, Guy could have requested a written\nstatement of the grounds for the denial which cited the law or regulation under which the\naccess was denied, or he could have applied to the district court for an order directing\nWarden Hargett to show cause why the record could not be inspected. He chose not to\n\n                                            10\n\fpursue either of these remedies and instead attempted to resolve the issue through the\nprison’s internal grievance process. 3 Similarly, when Deputy Director Lindly did not\nrespond to his request within seven (7) days, Guy could have petitioned the district court\nfor a determination as to whether Deputy Director Lindly had demonstrated that good\ncause existed for the delay. Guy did not pursue this remedy either, and he took no further\naction on the request he sent to Deputy Director Lindly.\n\n[¶19] A review of the statute also makes clear that the WPRA does not authorize the\ndistrict court to order the DOC to revise its policies or require its staff to be trained on the\napplication of the WPRA, nor does it authorize the imposition of monetary sanctions\nthrough a private suit.4 This Court will not read remedies into a statute that were not put\nthere by the legislature. Because Guy was ultimately, albeit belatedly, granted access to\nthe record, the WPRA does not afford him any remedies.\n\n[¶20] In addition, Guy’s petition asked the district court to declare that a certain class of\nrecords, which he titled “WDOC policy,” was subject to the WPRA, even though he had\nnot yet filed any requests to inspect those records. Guy’s brief asserts that he filed suit\nbecause he was seeking to “ensure similar unlawful denials did not transpire.” The\nWPRA does not grant the district court the authority to rule on records requests that have\nnot yet been made. The statute specifically allows a custodian to review the records\nbefore releasing them, and it provides the custodians with a procedure for denying the\nrequest.5 Because the WPRA contains these procedures, a district court cannot\nprospectively declare that a class of records that may be requested sometime in the future\nwill be subject to the WPRA and must be produced upon demand. Courts “ordinarily\nwill not decide as to future or contingent rights, but will wait until the event giving rise to\nrights has happened, or, in other words, until rights have become fixed under an existing\nstate of facts.” Anderson v.

In Powder River, the appellants had been denied access to records they\nbelieved to be subject to the WPRA. Instead of bringing a motion for an order to show cause, they filed a\npetition for review of administrative action and a complaint for declaratory judgment. We held that the\nappellants had to follow the procedures set forth in the WPRA, and they could not force the disclosure of\nthe records under the Administrative Procedure Act.\n4\n  The Court notes that Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 16-4-205 does provide that a person who knowingly and\nintentionally violates the WPRA is liable for a penalty not to exceed seven hundred fifty dollars\n($750.00). However, this penalty can only be recovered in a civil action initiated by the attorney general\nor the appropriate county attorney. It cannot be recovered in a civil suit brought by a private citizen like\nGuy.\n5\n  The Court notes that apparently neither Warden Hargett nor Deputy Director Lindly followed this\nprocedure. However, because the record was ultimately produced, the WPRA does not provide any\nremedies for the delayed production of the document.\n                                                    11\n\fGuy was asking the district court to rule on requests that he might make in the future, the\nWPRA did not give the district court the authority to grant the requested relief.\n\n[¶21] For these reasons, the district court correctly concluded that the Appellees were\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law and that Guy could not have asserted any set of\nfacts that created an entitlement to relief, and it was proper for the district court to\ndismiss the petition.\n\n   B.

Thus, under the relevant\n             statutes, in order for a court to have jurisdiction over a\n             declaratory judgment action, the “right” to be declared must\n             fall within the scope of the act and the plaintiff must be an\n             “interested” person.\n\nWilliam F.

City of Cheyenne,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2520603\"><a href=\"/opinion/2520603/cox-v-city-of-cheyenne/\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WY</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 8, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2520603\"><a href=\"/opinion/2520603/cox-v-city-of-cheyenne/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (Wyo. 2003)). As discussed above, the “rights” that\nGuy sought to have declared do not fall within the scope of the WPRA. Because the\nUDJA does not extend the jurisdiction of the district court beyond the scope of the\nunderlying statute, the proposed amendment would not have fixed the petition’s fatal\nflaw.\n\n[¶27] In addition, we have consistently held that there must be a justiciable controversy\nbefore relief can be granted under the UDJA. This Court has adopted a four part test to\ndetermine whether a justiciable controversy exists:\n\n             1. The parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished\n             from theoretical, rights or interests.\n\n             2. The controversy must be one upon which the judgment of\n             the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a\n             debate or argument evoking a purely political, administrative,\n             philosophical or academic conclusion.\n\n\n\n                                           13\n\f              3. It must be a controversy the judicial determination of\n              which will have the force and effect of a final judgment in\n              law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or other legal\n              relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or,\n              wanting these qualities to be of such great and overriding\n              public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of\n              them.\n\n              4. The proceedings must be genuinely adversary in character\n              and not a mere disputation, but advanced with sufficient\n              militancy to engender a thorough research and analysis of the\n              major issues.\n\nWilliam F. West Ranch, LLC, ¶ 12, 206 P.3d at 727 (quoting Cox, ¶ 10, 79 P.3d at 505).\nOur precedents provide guidance on how these factors should be applied. We have long\nrecognized that the Declaratory Judgments Act gives the courts no power to determine\nfuture rights or anticipated disputes or controversies and must treat them as existing and\ngenuine. Cranston v. Thomson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2609122\"><a href=\"/opinion/2609122/cranston-v-thomson/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 728-29 (Wyo. 1975); see also Anderson,\n154 P.2d at 335 (“The [Declaratory Judgments Act] does not require courts to render\nadvisory opinions or to determine moot or theoretical questions.”). As discussed above,\nGuy’s petition asked the district court to declare that a certain class of records would be\nsubject to disclosure in the future, even though he had not yet made an actual request to\ninspect these records. Therefore, he was attempting to have the district court determine\nhis future rights and render an advisory opinion. This was not the proper subject of a\ndeclaratory judgment action.\n\n[¶28] Similarly, we have held that “in order for a declaratory judgment to lie, it must be\nbased upon an actual and existing disagreement.” William F. West Ranch, LLC, ¶ 18,\n206 P.3d at 728 (citing Anderson, 154 P.2d at 341–42). Guy’s petition was based on a\npast disagreement, which had been resolved when the record was produced. Guy also\nsought resolution of anticipated future disagreements. Because the petition was not based\non an “actual and existing disagreement,” it was not the proper subject of a declaratory\njudgment action.\n\n[¶29] Finally, Guy’s petition also sought a declaration that Warden Hargett had violated\nthe WPRA, and he asked the district court to enjoin future violations of the act. This type\nof relief is not available through a declaratory judgment action. We discussed a similar\nsituation in Bird v. Rozier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125049\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125049/bird-v-rozier/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892-93 (Wyo. 1997). In that case, Bird\nrequested a declaratory order setting forth that the appellees had a legal, moral and/or\nethical duty to abide by or uphold and enforce the laws of Wyoming and that they\nviolated their duty. We held that although the UDJA authorizes Wyoming courts to\ndeclare the rights, status or other legal relations of parties, the court may refuse to render\na declaratory judgment where the judgment would not terminate the uncertainty or\n\n                                             14\n\fcontroversy at issue. Id. at 892 (citing Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 1-37-108). We found that Bird\nhad not made a showing that he was entitled to declaratory relief, because “[g]iving or\nrefusing the relief requested in his complaint–a declaration that appellees violated a legal\nduty to abide by the law, enforce the law, or uphold the law–would have no effect upon\nthe rights, status or legal relationship of Bird and appellees.” Bird, 948 P.2d at 893. We\nstated: “In this case, a judgment would have no practical effect on the litigants and would\nserve no useful purpose.” Id. The same reasoning applies in this case. A declaration that\nthe Appellees had violated the WPRA and were enjoined from violating the act in the\nfuture would have no effect on the rights, status or legal relationship of Guy and the\nAppellees and would serve no useful purpose. Thus, his claim was not the proper subject\nof a declaratory judgment action, and granting the proposed amendment would not have\nallowed Guy to state a set of facts upon which relief could be granted.\n\n[¶30] For these reasons, the district court could have reasonably concluded that the\nmotion to amend should be denied, because the proposed amendment was futile.\nTherefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to implicitly deny the\nmotion to amend.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n[¶31] The relief Guy sought was not available under the WPRA, and the district court\ncorrectly found that Appellees were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Guy did not\nassert any set of facts that created an entitlement to relief. Therefore, it was proper to\ndismiss Guy’s petition. In addition, Guy’s proposed amendment was futile, because it\ndid not fix the petition’s fundamental flaws. Thus, it was not an abuse of discretion for\nthe district court to implicitly deny the motion to amend.\n\n[¶32] Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f</pre>",
