Judge.\n\n\n                                     ORDER\n\n      Thomas Stanton, a Wisconsin prisoner, appeals from the district court’s grant\nof summary judgment in favor of prison officials, whom he accused of retaliating\nagainst him after he reported witnessing an officer attack an inmate. We affirm.\n\n       In December 2002, Stanton, while housed at the Oregon Correctional Center,\nreported to the superintendent that he saw correctional officer Phil Pausma shout\nat, grab, and shake inmate Brian Burkheimer. Stanton also reported that Pausma\n\n\n      *\n        After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral\nargument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record.\nSee Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 05-2794                                                                  Page 2\n\nhad previously abused inmates Tim Hunt and Sebastian Bootz. Supervising officer\nHarlan Buwalda investigated Stanton’s allegations. Hunt and Bootz denied that\nPausma had abused them, and Pausma denied having physical contact with\nStanton. Buwalda learned that two confidential informants overheard Stanton and\nBurkheimer scheming ways to get Pausma disciplined or fired. Ultimately\nBuwulda found no evidence to support Stanton’s allegations, and issued conduct\nreports to both Stanton and Burkheimer for lying about staff in violation of Wis.\nAdmin. Code § 303.271.\n\n       Stanton made several requests in preparation for his disciplinary hearing.\nHe first requested that nine prisoners be allowed to testify on his behalf. Captain\nTodd Johnson reviewed the request but permitted Stanton to call only\ntwo—Burkheimer and Bootz—after concluding that Stanton did not show good\ncause to call the others as required under Wis. Admin. Code § 303.81(1). Stanton\nalso requested that Jeff Karns, in his role as staff advocate, retrieve property and\ninformation from Buwalda, monitor inmate phone calls, and obtain polygraphic\ntests of those involved in the abuse he reported. Karns did not obtain these\nmaterials because he believed he was neither responsible nor authorized to perform\nthese tasks on Stanton’s behalf.\n\n        By the time of the hearing, Bootz had already been transferred to another\nfacility, but he provided a statement denying that he saw any altercation between\nPausma and Burkheimer. Burkheimer was not permitted to attend the hearing due\nto the lack of available staff, but he did provide a written statement in which he\ncorroborated Stanton’s allegations. John Richards, the presiding officer at the\ndisciplinary hearing, considered testimony from Buwalda, Karns, and Stanton, and\nwritten statements from Stanton, Bootz, Burkheimer, and the confidential\ninformants, and concluded that Stanton fabricated the assault claim. Richards\nimposed 8 days’ adjustment segregation and 180 days’ program segregation.\n\n       Stanton appealed and a new hearing was ordered after Secretary Cindy\nO’Donnell determined that Burkheimer should have been made available at the\nhearing. But by June 2003 when Stanton’s new hearing took place, Burkheimer\nhad been released from custody. Anthony Ashworth, the new presiding officer,\nconsidered all the information presented at the previous hearing in addition to\nwritten supplemental testimony from Burkheimer, and agreed that Stanton was\nguilty of lying about staff. Based on his assessment of the seriousness of the\ncharge, Ashworth sentenced Stanton to an additional 90 days in program\nsegregation.\n\n      Stanton appealed again, and the warden reduced the punishment to the\noriginal 180 days’ program segregation. Secretary O’Donnell then ordered the\n\fNo. 05-2794                                                                     Page 3\n\npunishment expunged from Stanton’s record because Burkheimer was never made\navailable at either disciplinary hearing as a witness.\n\n      Less than six months after final resolution of Stanton’s disciplinary appeals,\nLynn Nicolai, an offender classification specialist, denied Stanton a transfer to a\nminimum security facility based on her evaluation of Stanton’s attitude and her\nmistaken belief that he had six minor conduct reports. Stanton successfully\nappealed this review by proving that he did not have six prior conduct reports. But\nbecause Stanton had “special placement needs,” the minimum security prison\nrefused his transfer.\n\n       Stanton filed suit against 14 corrections officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nalleging that he was retaliated against during his disciplinary proceedings for\nreporting Pausma for the alleged assault. He also alleged that the administration\nof the disciplinary proceedings violated due process because the defendants\nsuppressed exculpatory evidence and lied at his hearings.\n\n      The district court screened Stanton’s complaint under 28 U.S.C. § 1915A and\ndismissed seven defendants, all Wisconsin DOC administrators responsible for\nreviewing inmate complaints and prisoner discipline, who were not involved in\nStanton’s investigation or disciplinary hearings. The court also dismissed his “due\nprocess” claims, reasoning on the basis of Zinermon v. Burch, 439 U.S. 113 (1990),\nthat adequate post-deprivation remedies were available, and in fact successful\nbecause his conduct report was eventually expunged. The court, however,\npermitted Stanton to proceed on his retaliation claims against Pausma, Buwalda,\nRichards, Johnson, Ashworth, Karns, and Nicolai. The court subsequently denied\nStanton’s request for appointed counsel.\n\n       The district court then granted the remaining defendants’ motion for\nsummary judgment. First the district court concluded that Stanton submitted no\nevidence “from which a jury could infer that [the defendants’] motives were\nretaliatory.” (R. 44 at 7.) Further, citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 286 (1977), the court concluded that Stanton failed to show\nthat the disciplinary proceedings conducted by the defendants would not have\noccurred without retaliatory motive.\n\n       On appeal, Stanton first argues that the district court erred when it screened\nhis complaint and dismissed his “due process” claims. Stanton’s argument is\ndifficult to discern, but he seems to suggest that his post-deprivation remedy was\ninadequate because his administrative claim was resolved without meaningfully\naddressing the due process violations that triggered his lawsuit.\n\fNo. 05-2794                                                                     Page 4\n\n       To state a procedural due process claim, a prisoner must allege that the state\ndeprived him of a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Lekas v. Briley, 405\nF.3d 602, 607 (7th Cir. 2005). But prisoners have no liberty interest in remaining\nin the general prison population. See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995);\nLekas, 405 F.3d at 607. Here Stanton’s punishment—8 days in adjustment\nsegregation and 180 days in program segregation—did not present the sort of\n“atypical, significant deprivation” in which the state might create a liberty interest.\nSee Sandin, 515 U.S. at 486. Thus the district court properly dismissed his due\nprocess claims.\n\n       Next Stanton argues that the district court improperly dismissed the seven\ndefendants from his suit. He contends that under Smith v. Rowe, 761 F.2d 360, 369\n(7th Cir. 1985), he should have been permitted to proceed against these individuals\non a “failure to act” or “indirect participation” theory of liability, because these\nindividuals violated their duty to correct obvious due process violations. But as\nnoted above, Stanton cannot state a due process claim because the punishment he\nreceived did not constitute a deprivation that implicated a protected liberty interest.\nAnd Stanton did not allege that any of these seven individuals participated directly\nin the disciplinary decisions that formed the basis for his retaliation claims. See\nZimmerman v. Tribble, 226 F.3d 568, 574 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n      Stanton also challenges the district court’s denial of his motion for appointed\ncounsel, a ruling that we review for abuse of discretion. See Greeno v. Daley, 414\nF.3d 645, 658 (7th Cir. 2005). Stanton argues that he needed the aid of appointed\ncounsel because he alone could not locate and interview witnesses, find an expert to\nconduct polygraph exams to resolve “conflicting testimony,” obtain legal materials,\nand navigate through the legal complexity of his claims. As the district court found,\nhowever, the actual legal issues in this case are not complex, and furthermore\nStanton’s comprehensive pleadings and discovery requests demonstrate both a\nfamiliarity and understanding of the issues involved in this case. The district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying Stanton’s request for counsel. Zarnes v.\nRhodes, 64 F.3d 285, 289 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Finally Stanton argues that the district court erred by granting summary\njudgment for the defendants. He contends that the court disregarded three\nsignificant pieces of evidence: (1) statements from two inmates, Norton and Bentle,\npurportedly vouching for Stanton’s contention that Pausma beat up Burkheimer, (2)\nBurkheimer’s written statements presented at Stanton’s disciplinary hearings, and\n(3) Stanton’s own complaint. He contends all are evidence supporting his\nallegations against Pausma, proving that he did not lie about the abuse he\nwitnessed.\n\fNo. 05-2794                                                                     Page 5\n\n       To survive summary judgment, Stanton had the burden of showing that he\ncould prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his allegations of Pausma’s\nabusive treatment of prisoners motivated the prison officials’ retaliatory action.\nSpiegla v. Hull, 371 F.3d 928, 942 (7th Cir. 2004). He need not show but-for\ncausation; he need show only that his speech was a “motivating factor” in the\nretaliation. Id.\n\n       Here the district court properly found that Stanton failed to present\nsufficient evidence to show that any prison official disciplined him with a retaliatory\nmotive. Stanton points to Norton’s statement relating what other prisoners had\ntold him about Pausma’s abuse of Burkheimer, but this statement was inadmissible\nbecause it was hearsay. Smith v. Dunn, 368 F.3d 705, 709 (7th Cir. 2004). And\nBentle’s statement was irrelevant because it was not submitted to prison officials\nuntil August 2003, after Stanton’s second disciplinary hearing. This late\nsubmission was never considered by prison officials, and thus could not have been\nwithheld from Stanton out of retaliation. Stanton next points to Burkheimer’s\nstatements and his own complaint as evidence that they both told the truth about\nPausma’s abuse, and that the defendants must have punished him out of\nretaliation. Yet a prison investigation and two disciplinary hearings uncovered no\nevidence to support Stanton’s accusations against Pausma and both men were\npunished for lying. Burkheimer’s and Stanton’s assertions do not identify specific\nfacts showing evidence of retaliatory intent and alone are insufficient to defeat\nsummary judgment.

But as\nnoted above, Stanton cannot state a due process claim because the punishment he\nreceived did not constitute a deprivation that implicated a protected liberty interest.\nAnd Stanton did not allege that any of these seven individuals participated directly\nin the disciplinary decisions that formed the basis for his retaliation claims. See\nZimmerman v. Tribble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770400\"><a href=\"/opinion/770400/william-k-zimmerman-v-margarita-tribble-craig-hanks-and-edward-l-cohn/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n      Stanton also challenges the district court’s denial of his motion for appointed\ncounsel, a ruling that we review for abuse of discretion. See Greeno v. Daley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790952\"><a href=\"/opinion/790952/donald-f-greeno-v-george-daley/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 (7th Cir. 2005). Stanton argues that he needed the aid of appointed\ncounsel because he alone could not locate and interview witnesses, find an expert to\nconduct polygraph exams to resolve “conflicting testimony,” obtain legal materials,\nand navigate through the legal complexity of his claims. As the district court found,\nhowever, the actual legal issues in this case are not complex, and furthermore\nStanton’s comprehensive pleadings and discovery requests demonstrate both a\nfamiliarity and understanding of the issues involved in this case. The district court\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying Stanton’s request for counsel. Zarnes v.\nRhodes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702562\"><a href=\"/opinion/702562/marina-zarnes-v-randall-rhodes-sergeant-402-officer-of-the-sheriffs/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 289 (7th Cir. 1995).\n\n       Finally Stanton argues that the district court erred by granting summary\njudgment for the defendants. He contends that the court disregarded three\nsignificant pieces of evidence: (1) statements from two inmates, Norton and Bentle,\npurportedly vouching for Stanton’s contention that Pausma beat up Burkheimer, (2)\nBurkheimer’s written statements presented at Stanton’s disciplinary hearings, and\n(3) Stanton’s own complaint. He contends all are evidence supporting his\nallegations against Pausma, proving that he did not lie about the abuse he\nwitnessed.\n\fNo. 05-2794                                                                     Page 5\n\n       To survive summary judgment, Stanton had the burden of showing that he\ncould prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his allegations of Pausma’s\nabusive treatment of prisoners motivated the prison officials’ retaliatory action.\nSpiegla v. Hull, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786562\"><a href=\"/opinion/786562/nancy-spiegla-v-major-eddie-hull-individually-as-an-employee-of-westville/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 942 (7th Cir. 2004). He need not show but-for\ncausation; he need show only that his speech was a “motivating factor” in the\nretaliation. Id.\n\n       Here the district court properly found that Stanton failed to present\nsufficient evidence to show that any prison official disciplined him with a retaliatory\nmotive. Stanton points to Norton’s statement relating what other prisoners had\ntold him about Pausma’s abuse of Burkheimer, but this statement was inadmissible\nbecause it was hearsay. Smith v. Dunn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786220\"><a href=\"/opinion/786220/diane-smith-v-stephanie-dunn-individually-and-as-principal-of-edmund/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 709 (7th Cir. 2004). And\nBentle’s statement was irrelevant because it was not submitted to prison officials\nuntil August 2003, after Stanton’s second disciplinary hearing. This late\nsubmission was never considered by prison officials, and thus could not have been\nwithheld from Stanton out of retaliation. Stanton next points to Burkheimer’s\nstatements and his own complaint as evidence that they both told the truth about\nPausma’s abuse, and that the defendants must have punished him out of\nretaliation. Yet a prison investigation and two disciplinary hearings uncovered no\nevidence to support Stanton’s accusations against Pausma and both men were\npunished for lying. Burkheimer’s and Stanton’s assertions do not identify specific\nfacts showing evidence of retaliatory intent and alone are insufficient to defeat\nsummary judgment.
