(No. 1:90-cv-1769-WCO), William C.

The United States District Court for the Northern District\n\fof Georgia awarded the plaintiffs the desegregative transportation\n\ncosts they sought and ordered the State of Georgia to fund those\n\nfuture transportation expenses.     The district court disallowed,\n\nhowever, the plaintiffs' recovery of the costs of their \"majority\n\nto minority\" transfer1 and magnet school desegregation programs.\n\nThe state defendants appeal the district court's adverse ruling on\n\nthe transportation issue, and the DeKalb County plaintiffs filed a\n\ncross-appeal to the district court's rejection of their claim for\n\ntheir programmatic costs.    For the reasons stated in this opinion,\n\nwe reverse the district court's judgment granting transportation\n\ncosts to the plaintiffs and affirm its ruling in favor of the\n\ndefendants denying the plaintiffs' recovery of their costs incurred\n\nin the other desegregation undertakings.\n\n                     I. BACKGROUND OF THIS APPEAL\n\nA. The Desegregation Litigation.\n\n     DeKalb County, Georgia, is a suburban area adjacent to and\n\neast of Atlanta. 2   The DeKalb County Board of Education (\"DCBE\")\n\noperates the DeKalb County School System (\"DCSS\"), the schools\n\nwithin the DeKalb County School District, which, at all times\n\n\n     1\n      Under the \"majority to minority\" transfer program, a\nstudent could transfer from a school where his race constituted a\nmajority of the student population to a school where his race was\nin the minority. This program was started by the DCSS on it own\ninitiative in 1972, but was ordered expanded by the district\ncourt in 1976.\n     2\n      A small part of the City of Atlanta extends into DeKalb\nCounty. That area of DeKalb County is part of the City of\nAtlanta School System. Similarly, the City of Decatur, located\nin the central part of DeKalb County, operates an independent\nmunicipal school system. The areas within the corporate limits\nof those two cities are not part of the DeKalb County School\nSystem and are not affected by this action.\n\frelevant to this case, was the largest school district in the State\n\nof Georgia.     Consistent with state law and its own policies and\n\nthose promulgated by the State Board of Education and the State\n\nDepartment     of    Education,    the   DCSS     historically     operated   a\n\nsegregated, dual system of education with separate schools for\n\nblack and white students.      In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United\n\nStates declared segregated schools unconstitutional in Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873\n\n(1954), and the following year ordered all such segregated school\n\ndistricts to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed,\" Brown v.\n\nBoard of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed.\n\n1083 (1955).        Those rulings notwithstanding, the DCSS did not\n\ncommence its desegregation efforts until 1966 when it implemented\n\na \"freedom of choice\" plan, pursuant to which some black students\n\nattended formerly de jure white schools.3\n\n      In 1968, the Supreme Court decided Green v. County School\n\nBoard, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), in which\n\nthe   Court   held    that,   if   freedom   of   choice   plans    failed    to\n\nadequately end the unlawful segregation of a school district, other\n\nmeans must be utilized to achieve that purpose. Within two months,\n\na class of black students filed suit against the DCSS.                In June,\n\n1969, the United States District Court for the Northern District of\n\nGeorgia entered an order which abolished the freedom of choice plan\n\nand enjoined the DCSS from further discrimination on the basis of\n\nrace.     The court ordered the DCSS to close all remaining            de jure\n\n\n      3\n      Additionally, in 1968, the DCBE closed Bruce Street High\nSchool, one of two all-black high schools.\n\fblack schools and to establish a neighborhood school attendance\n\npolicy.        The court retained jurisdiction to ensure compliance with\n\nits order.        See Pitts v. Cherry, C.A. No. 11946 (N.D.Ga. June 12,\n\n1969).\n\n       The parties did not seek any modification of the 1969 order or\n\nrequest additional relief until 1975 when the plaintiffs complained\n\nthat DCSS had violated the earlier plan.                   In 1976, the district\n\ncourt ordered the DCSS to expand its \"majority to minority\" (\"M to\n\nM\") transfer system of assignment, pursuant to which a student\n\ncould transfer from any school in which his or her race was in the\n\nmajority to a school in which that race was in the minority, by\n\nproviding free transportation to the students, and to reassign\n\nfaculty and staff members so that the racial percentages at each\n\nschool would approximate those in the system at large.                 In the late\n\n1970's, the district court considered several plan modifications,\n\nnot relevant to this litigation, requested by the DCSS.\n\n       In 1983, the plaintiffs sought additional relief in the\n\ndistrict court.4           In an order entered following a hearing on the\n\nplaintiffs' request, the district court, apparently relying on its\n\n1969 order in the case, asserted that the DCSS had been converted\n\nfrom       a   dual   to   a   unitary   school   system   in   that   year.   The\n\nplaintiffs appealed to this court, which held that the district\n\ncourt had improperly declared the DCSS to be unitary without\n\n       4\n      The plaintiffs contended that the limitation on M to M\ntransfers to predominantly white Lakeside High School and the\nproposed expansion of Redan High School would have the effect of\nperpetuating segregation in the system. The district court\nordered the DCSS to accept additional black students in the M to\nM program at Lakeside but declined to enjoin the expansion of\nRedan.\n\fnotifying the plaintiffs and conducting a hearing on that issue.\n\nPitts v. Freeman, 755 F.2d 1423 (11th Cir.1985).\n\n       In     January    1986,   the   DCSS   filed   a   motion    seeking   final\n\ndismissal        of   the   case,   and   the   district    court    conducted   a\n\nthree-week bench trial in July, 1987 to determine whether the\n\nsystem had indeed achieved unitary status.                 In an order entered\n\nJune       30,   1988,   the   district   court   denied    the    DCSS's   motion,\n\nconcluding that vestiges of the dual system remained in staff\n\nassignments, resource allocation and quality of education.                     The\n\ncourt found, however, that the system had become unitary with\n\nregard to student assignments, transportation, physical facilities\n\nand extracurricular activities.               Accordingly, the court decided\n\nthat no further relief was necessary in those areas.                 The district\n\ncourt certified its order for immediate appeal pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1292(b), and both sides sought review in this court.5\n\n       The appellate panel affirmed the district court's judgment\n\nthat the DCSS had not fulfilled its responsibilities with respect\n\nto faculty and staff assignments but reversed its finding that the\n\nDCSS had met its obligations in the assignment of students.                    The\n\ncourt also held that a school system could not be declared unitary\n\nuntil it had maintained racial equality for a period of three years\n\nin all of the categories identified by the Supreme Court in Green.6\n\n       5\n      The plaintiffs did not seek review of the district court's\nruling with respect to the areas of transportation,\nextracurricular activities and facilities. Consequently, the\nappellate court observed that those issues were not before it.\n       6\n      Under Green, the factors to be considered in determining\nwhether a school system has achieved unitary status are student\nassignment, faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular\nactivities and facilities. Green, 391 U.S. at 435, 88 S.Ct. at\n\fThe court, therefore, determined that the DCSS was not being\n\noperated as a unitary system.         Pitts v. Freeman, 887 F.2d 1438,\n\n1450 (11th Cir.1989).\n\n     The DCSS petitioned the Supreme Court for review.             In 1992,\n\nthe Supreme Court reversed this court, holding that a district\n\ncourt is permitted to withdraw judicial supervision with respect to\n\ndiscrete categories in which the school district has achieved\n\ncompliance with a court-ordered desegregation plan. See Freeman v.\n\nPitts, 503 U.S. 467, 471, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1436, 118 L.Ed.2d 108\n\n(1992).   According to the Court, \"in the course of supervising\n\ndesegregation   plans,     federal     courts    have   the   authority   to\n\nrelinquish   supervision     and     control    of   school   districts   in\n\nincremental stages, before full compliance has been achieved in\n\nevery area of school operations.\"        Id. at 490, 112 S.Ct. at 1445.7\n\n     With respect to the case before it, the Court held \"the Court\n\nof Appeals did err in holding that, as a matter of law, the\n\nDistrict Court had no discretion to permit DCSS to regain control\n\nover student assignment, transportation, physical facilities, and\n\nextracurricular activities, while retaining court supervision over\n\nthe areas of faculty and administrative assignments and the quality\n\n\n1692.\n     7\n      The Court noted that the racial composition of the student\npopulation of the DCSS had changed dramatically over the years.\nWhen the district court first ordered desegregation of the\nsystem, only 5.6% of the student population was black; by 1986,\nthe percentage of black students had reached 47%. Freeman v.\nPitts, 503 U.S. at 475, 112 S.Ct. at 1438. Evidence subsequently\nintroduced in this litigation showed that, by the 1992-93 school\nyear, black students made up 66% of the district's student\nenrollment. (District court order entered September 23, 1994, at\n2).\n\fof education, where full compliance had not been demonstrated.\"\n\nId. at 492, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.             Turning to the question whether\n\ncontinuing judicial control over student attendance was necessary\n\nto achieve compliance in other areas of the system's operations,\n\nthe Court noted that the district court, not having its analysis\n\nbefore it, did not have the opportunity to make specific findings\n\nand   conclusions    on    this   aspect    of   the   case   and    stated      that\n\n\"[f]urther proceedings are appropriate for this purpose.\"                       Id. at\n\n498, 112 S.Ct. at 1449.\n\n      Complying     with    the   Supreme    Court's      mandate,       this   court\n\nremanded   the    case     to   the   district    court    with   the     following\n\ninstructions:\n\n      The issues to be considered by the district court should\n      include, but not necessarily be limited to, faculty and staff\n      assignments (which may or may not involve a re-examination of\n      student assignments), resource allocation, the quality of\n      education being received by all students and the good faith\n      commitment of the school district.\n\nPitts v. Freeman, 979 F.2d 1472, 1473 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam\n\n).\n\n      The district court subsequently entered orders directing the\n\nparties to address whether the DCSS had become unitary with respect\n\nto faculty assignments and resource allocation, whether the system\n\nhad demonstrated good faith in complying with the desegregation\n\norder   and   whether      it   was   providing    a   quality      of    education\n\nconsistent with the letter and spirit of the decree.                      The court\n\nheld hearings on these issues in January and March, 1996.                       In an\n\norder entered June 12, 1996, the district court stated that it\n\nwould \"not revisit those ... factors in which a unitary system has\n\nalready been held to exist.           Rather, the court will address only\n\fthose issues left open by the 1988 Order, and the appellate and\n\nSupreme Court review of that order.\" Mills v. Freeman, 942 F.Supp.\n\n1449, 1454 (N.D.Ga.1996). Thus, the court considered on the merits\n\nonly the issues of faculty assignments, quality of education, and\n\nthe DCSS's good faith.8         The court concluded that the DCSS had\n\nachieved unitary status in all respects and granted its motion for\n\nfinal dismissal of the case.        Id. at 1463-64.      No appeal has been\n\ntaken from that order.\n\nB. History of this Litigation.\n\n     This lawsuit was filed in 1990 by the DeKalb County School\n\nDistrict, the members of the DeKalb County Board of Education, and\n\nseveral parents and students (hereinafter collectively \"DeKalb\")\n\nagainst the State of Georgia, the Governor, the State Board of\n\nEducation and its members, the State Superintendent of Schools, the\n\nState Department of Education and several other state officials\n\n(collectively      the   \"State\")      seeking   to     recover   its    past\n\ntransportation and other expenses related to its desegregation\n\nefforts.    In addition, as stated earlier, DeKalb sought injunctive\n\nrelief requiring the State to help fund its future desegregation\n\nexpenses.     It    contended   that    the   State's   efforts   to    impede\n\nintegration violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\n\nConstitution;      the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1701-1758, which,        inter alia, bars a state education\n\nagency from segregating students on the basis of race, color or\n\n     8\n      Given the Supreme Court's opinion in the case and this\ncourt's order remanding the case to the district court, the\ndistrict court could have reexamined the area of student\nassignments, but the court apparently elected to treat that\nquestion as settled by its 1988 order.\n\fnational origin and requires an agency which has practiced such\n\nsegregation to take affirmative steps to remove the vestiges of a\n\ndual school system;    Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000d et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis\n\nof race in any governmental program that is the recipient of\n\nfederal funds;    and certain provisions of state law.\n\n      The case was tried to the court in July 1993.      The evidence at\n\ntrial disclosed that the State funds a portion of each local school\n\ndistrict's    educational   expenditures   depending    on    a   number   of\n\nfactors including, since 1985, the wealth of the local district.\n\nThe   State   partially     reimburses   local    districts       for   their\n\ntransportation expenses based on a formula in use since the early\n\n1960's.    Every three years, using maps supplied by the local\n\ndistricts plotting the location of students residing more than 1\n\nand 1/2 miles from their assigned or neighborhood school, state\n\nofficials draw \"ideal\" bus routes which will collect those students\n\nand deliver them most efficiently to that school.                 They then\n\ncalculate the number of route miles and buses needed to transport\n\nthose students using these ideal routes and determine the amount\n\neach district will be allocated for transportation expenses. These\n\ncalculations are made without regard to the actual schools to which\n\nany of the students are assigned or to the local district's actual\n\nbus routes or transportation expenses.           Consequently, the State\n\ndoes not compensate DeKalb, or any other local district in the\n\nstate, for the additional expense incurred in transporting the\n\nstudents in its magnet school and M to M transfer programs, who\n\nfrequently reside long distances from the schools which they\n\fattend.9\n\n     The     district      court      entered       its   findings    of   fact    and\n\nconclusions of law in an order dated September 23, 1994.                    The court\n\nobserved that the State had vigorously resisted the integration of\n\nits public schools and had adopted a number of statutes and\n\npolicies     over   the    years      in   an    effort   to   preserve    segregated\n\nschools.     The court noted that in the 1960's the State had refused\n\nto fund transportation for students outside their local attendance\n\nzone except for white students seeking to attend white schools\n\nunder freedom-of-choice plans.              (Order at 6-7).10        When compulsory\n\nbusing     began    to    be   used    to       desegregate    schools,    the    State\n\nDepartment of Education adopted in 1972 Policy ED(1)G, which\n\nprovided that student transportation funds were to be calculated\n\nusing the school nearest the student's residence having space in\n\nthe appropriate grade.11              The court found that this policy was\n\n     9\n      The district court observed that 6,251 students who\nparticipated in the M to M transfer and magnet school programs\nwere transported by the DCSS in fiscal year 1992. (Order entered\nSeptember 23, 1994, at 12-13).\n     10\n      In support of this statement, the district court cited the\n1968 deposition of John C. Maddox, Chief of Pupil Transportation\nServices for the State Board of Education, taken in United States\nv. Board of Education of Johnson County, Georgia, C.A. No. 696,\nin the Southern District of Georgia. The testimony Maddox\nactually gave in his deposition, however, does not appear to\nsupport the district court's assertion. In fact, in response to\na hypothetical question posed by one of the attorneys, Maddox\nstated that the state would fund the transportation of a black\nstudent who was assigned by a local school board to a formerly\nall-white school as part of a freedom-of-choice desegregation\nplan. See Maddox Dep. at 108-09, Plaintiffs' Exh. 302.\n     11\n          The policy provided the following:\n\n             Pupil transportation funds shall be calculated on the\n             basis of the school having available space in the\n             pupil's grade level nearest the pupil's place of\n\fadopted to discourage desegregative student transfers.              (Id. at 11-\n\n12).12 In 1990, DeKalb requested that the State fund the additional\n\ntransportation expenses required by its magnet and M to M transfer\n\nprograms.        The State refused, citing Policy ED(1)G and other\n\npolicies. The district court found that Policy ED(1)G was repealed\n\nin 1991.       It apparently was replaced by a similar provision, a rule\n\nadopted by the State Board of Education in November 1990.13\n\n       The district court concluded that the State's system of\n\ncalculating reimbursable transportation expenses is not consistent\n\nwith O.C.G.A. § 20-2-188(d), which directs in part that students\n\n\"who live beyond one and one-half miles from the school to which\n\nthey    are     assigned    ...   shall   be   eligible   to   be   counted   as\n\n\n\n               residence.\n\n       State Board of Education Policy ED(1)G.\n       12\n      The district court reached this conclusion notwithstanding\ntestimony from Samuel P. McCullough, Jr., Director of Pupil\nTransportation for the State Board of Education. In his\ndeposition, taken in the parallel litigation brought on behalf of\nthe Savannah/Chatham County school system, McCullough testified\nthat, in the time period from 1976 to 1986, the State funded bus\ntransportation for students bused to paired schools in\nnoncontiguous attendance zones for desegregation purposes. See\nMcCullough Dep. at 95-96.\n       13\n            The new policy stated in relevant part:\n\n               (i) Routing shall be as uniform as practical.

No. 75 & 77.\n\ftransported students....\"                From this, the court held that the\n\nState's transportation funding policy violates this provision of\n\nstate law, the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964.          The court found, however, that the State had\n\nnot violated the Equal Educational Opportunity Act.                   ( Id. at 20-\n                                                     14\n28).    Using figures supplied by DeKalb                  and not disputed by the\n\nState,      the   court     held   that    DeKalb    was    due   \"$24,632,351    in\n\ntransportation monies that should have been paid pursuant to state\n\nlaw.\"       ( Id. at 43).     The court enjoined the State from ignoring\n\nmagnet and M to M transfer students in its future calculation of\n\ntransportation       funding       and    ordered    the     State   to   base   its\n\ncomputation on each student's actual school assignment.                    ( Id. at\n\n23).\n\n       Turning to DeKalb's request for reimbursement for its magnet\n\nschool and M to M programs, the district court found that, under\n\nGeorgia law, DeKalb was primarily responsible for the operation of\n\nits public schools and, therefore, for remedying the effects of its\n\nearlier dual school system.               The court noted that there was \"no\n\nevidence ... to suggest that DeKalb's M to M or magnet programs\n\nwere ever hindered or interfered with by the state or state\n\nofficials in their initial voluntary form or in their judicially\n\nmodified form.\"           (Order at 19).            The court observed that a\n\n       14\n      DeKalb submitted evidence that the transportation costs of\nits M to M transfer and magnet school programs for the fiscal\nyears 1978 through 1992 was $34,726,764.00. According to the\nplaintiffs, if the State had construed O.C.G.A. § 20-2-188 as did\nthey and the district court, the State would have paid the DCSS a\ntotal of $25,372,748.00 over that period rather than the\n$740,397.00 the State actually paid toward those costs. The\ndistrict court arrived at the amount of its award by subtracting\nthe latter figure from the former.\n\fthree-judge panel had in an earlier lawsuit \"found that no acts on\n\nthe part of the state had been shown to foster a segregative\n\ncondition since approximately 1964.\"          (Id. at 32, citing Armour v.\n\nNix, No. 16708, at 7 & 27 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 24, 1979), aff'd, 446 U.S.\n\n930, 100 S.Ct. 2146, 64 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980)).              The court further\n\nobserved that the Supreme Court had affirmed its finding that the\n\nDCSS was unitary with respect to transportation and three other of\n\nthe six factors identified by the Court in Green.              On this record,\n\nthe   court   concluded   that   it   could    not    \"order    the   state    to\n\nparticipate in a remedy for the removal of a vestige of the dual\n\nschool system which the court has already declared removed.\"                  (Id.\n\nat 30). 15    Therefore, the court refused to order the State to\n\ncompensate the DCSS for its programmatic desegregation expenses.\n\nThe court distinguished cases cited by the plaintiffs where state\n\ngovernments had been ordered to pay for desegregation efforts on\n\nthe ground that those states had much greater responsibility for\n\nand authority over local schools.       Moreover, the court found that,\n\nin those cases, the state or state agencies had been involved in\n\nthe   desegregation   litigation      from    the    beginning.       Here,    in\n\ncontrast, the DCSS had been under court supervision for over 20\n\nyears before filing this action against the State.\n\n      Both DeKalb and the State filed motions to alter or amend the\n\njudgment.     In response to the State's motion, the district court\n\nclarified its order to specify that its award of damages to DeKalb\n\n      15\n      This conclusion seems to conflict with the court's\ndecision to require the state to participate in a transportation\nremedy despite the earlier holding in the desegregation\nlitigation that the DCSS was unitary with respect to\ntransportation.\n\fwas based on federal, not state, law, thereby avoiding the bar\n\nposed by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.   According to\n\nthe court, it had used state law simply to measure the damages due\n\nDeKalb.   The court reiterated, however, its finding that the State\n\nhad not violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act because\n\n\"the transportation policy is not a vestige of the dual school\n\nsystem....\"    (Order dated December 19, 1994, at 8) (emphasis in\n\noriginal).    As a consequence of DeKalb's motion, the court awarded\n\nthe plaintiffs an additional $9,259,257 in transportation expenses\n\nfor the 1993 and 1994 fiscal years.    These appeals followed.\n\n                       II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n     The district court's findings of fact may not be disturbed\n\nunless they are clearly erroneous.    Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);   Robinson\n\nv. City of Fairfield, 750 F.2d 1507, 1510 (11th Cir.1985).       Its\n\nconclusions of law are subject to de novo review by this court.\n\nVeale v. Citibank, F.S.B., 85 F.3d 577, 579 (11th Cir.1996).\n\n                           III. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Defendants' Appeal.\n\n1. Retrospective Monetary Relief.\n\n     The State urges that the district court's monetary damages\n\nviolate the Eleventh Amendment and settled principles of comity and\n\nfederalism.    It notes that the court's September 23, 1994, order\n\nrepeatedly states that DeKalb is due compensation for the State's\n\nviolation of O.C.G.A. § 20-2-188, a holding that is barred by the\n\nEleventh Amendment.      While conceding that the district court\n\nclarified its order by relying on the Fourteenth Amendment and\n\nTitle VI rather than the state statute as the basis for its award,\n\fthe State argues that it is, in substance, one for the violation of\n\nstate law.   It also insists that the district court's decision\n\nabridges the political integrity of the State by reallocating a tax\n\nburden between DeKalb County taxpayers and those who bear the tax\n\nburden in the state-at-large.\n\n     The State also maintains that Title VI does not support the\n\naward of damages in this case.    While admitting that Congress has\n\nabrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to\n\nactions brought pursuant to Title VI, the defendants assert that\n\nthis case is far from a legitimate Title VI action.      It alleges\n\nthat DeKalb County, as a subordinate creation of the state, lacks\n\nstanding to bring this action against the State.   Moreover, noting\n\nthat this case is simply one for allocating a tax burden, not for\n\nsubstantive relief under the civil rights laws, the State claims\n\nthat the individual plaintiffs here also lack standing to seek\n\nrelief against the State.\n\n     The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that\n\n\"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed\n\nto extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted\n\nagainst one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or\n\nby Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"   Over a century ago,\n\nthe Supreme Court made clear that this language also barred suits\n\nagainst a state by its own citizens.    See Hans v. Louisiana, 134\n\nU.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890).   In short, the Eleventh\n\nAmendment constitutes an \"absolute bar\" to a state's being sued by\n\nits own citizens, among others.     See Monaco v. Mississippi, 292\n\nU.S. 313, 329, 54 S.Ct. 745, 750, 78 L.Ed. 1282 (1934).      In the\n\fview of the Supreme Court, the principle of sovereign immunity\n\nembodied in the Eleventh Amendment is a broad, fundamental one,\n\nwhich    is     \"among       the   most    stable    in    our   constitutional\n\njurisprudence.\"         Welch v. State Department of Highways, 483 U.S.\n\n468, 486, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2952, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987).                       The\n\ndoctrine plays a vital role in our federal system by preventing the\n\nsensitive problems which would result from compelling one sovereign\n\nto appear in the courts of the other against its will.               Id. at 486-\n\n87, 107 S.Ct. at 2952.\n\n        For that reason, absent its consent, a state may not be sued\n\nin federal court unless Congress has clearly and unequivocally\n\nabrogated the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity by exercising its\n\npower with respect to rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSee Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,\n\n99, 104 S.Ct. 900, 907, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).              Of course, Congress\n\nmay   not     nullify    a   state's    immunity    with   respect   to   alleged\n\nviolations of state law.           For that reason, a federal court may not\n\nentertain a cause of action against a state for alleged violations\n\nof state law, even if that state claim is pendent to a federal\n\nclaim which the district court could adjudicate.                 Id. at 117-23,\n\n104 S.Ct. at 917-20.          According to the Supreme Court, \"[a] federal\n\ncourt's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of\n\nstate law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not vindicate\n\nthe supreme authority of federal law.                On the contrary, it is\n\ndifficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than\n\nwhen a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform\n\ntheir conduct to state law.            Such a result conflicts directly with\n\fthe principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\"\n\nId. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.\n\n       In this case, DeKalb invoked the jurisdiction of the district\n\ncourt by asserting that the State's conduct violated federal rights\n\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI and the Equal\n\nEducational Opportunities Act. As far as transportation funding is\n\nconcerned, however, the gravamen of its complaint appears to be\n\nthat the State has improperly interpreted and failed to adhere to\n\na state statute governing reimbursement for transportation costs.\n\nAs was noted earlier, the district court's order concluded that\n\nDeKalb was due additional \"transportation monies that should have\n\nbeen paid pursuant to state law.\"       It is uncontroverted that the\n\ndamages awarded to DeKalb in this case was measured by application\n\nof the disputed Georgia statutory provision, O.C.G.A. § 20-2-\n\n188(d).    DeKalb's discussion of this issue in its brief before us\n\nis almost entirely devoted to state law.         Looking at the substance\n\nof   the   district   court's   judgment,   it   appears   to   be   one   for\n\nviolation of state law, a holding barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n\nSee Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.\n\n      Replying to the State's post-judgment motion, the district\n\ncourt modified its initial decision to rest its judgment more\n\nclearly on its finding that the State had violated the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and Title VI.         Even if we assume that the district\n\ncourt's disposition is based on federal law, the judgment in favor\n\nof DeKalb must still overcome the Eleventh Amendment barrier.              The\n\nSupreme Court has found no general abrogation of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity for claims brought pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\fSee Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358\n\n(1979).        On the other hand, the parties agree that Congress has\n\nabolished the states' immunity for causes of action grounded in\n\nTitle VI.        See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7.16   Thus, the State could be\n\nforced to defend a Title VI action in federal court without its\n\nconsent.\n\n       Title VI provides that \"[n]o person in the United States\n\nshall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be\n\nexcluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\n\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving\n\nFederal financial assistance.\"       42 U.S.C. § 2000d. 17   While Title\n\nVI is not itself an independent source of federal funding, it bars\n\ndiscrimination in over 80 federal programs which provide financial\n\nassistance to state and local educational activities.            See 34\n\nC.F.R. Pt. 100, App. A.\n\n            In spite of this bar, it does not appear that any of the\n\nplaintiffs here have standing to sue the State for a violation of\n\nTitle VI.       First, it is now clearly the law in this circuit that a\n\npolitical subdivision of a state, such as the DeKalb County School\n\nDistrict and its Board of Education, may not maintain a suit for a\n\nbreach of Title VI against the State in federal court.        In U.S. v.\n\nAlabama, 791 F.2d 1450, 1455-57 (11th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479\n\nU.S. 1085, 107 S.Ct. 1287, 94 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987), a panel of this\n\n       16\n      The abrogation of immunity applies to violations that\noccur in whole or in part after October 21, 1986, the effective\ndate of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, Pub.L. 99-506.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(b).\n       17\n            Pub.L. 88-352, Title VI, § 601, July 2, 1964, 78 Stat.\n252.\n\fcourt held that a state university lacked standing to sue the\n\nsovereign that created it under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for a violation of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.         Furthermore, the court concluded that a\n\nstate university was not a \"person\" with rights under Title VI\n\nwhich could be vindicated in a lawsuit against the state.                      Id.;\n\nsee also Knight v. Alabama, 14 F.3d 1534, 1554 (11th Cir.1994).\n\n          DeKalb counters that the plaintiffs can circumvent this\n\nobstacle because there are individual citizens who are plaintiffs\n\nin this case.      The Supreme Court has recognized a private right of\n\naction for individuals injured by a Title VI violation. See Cannon\n\nv. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 99 S.Ct. 1946,\n\n1957-58, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).                 Nonetheless, the individual\n\nplaintiffs here appear to be only nominally interested in the\n\noutcome     of   this   action.        The   legitimate   interests    of     those\n\nindividuals are in an integrated educational system in DeKalb\n\nCounty which complies with the requirements of the Constitution,\n\nand their rights in those matters have been vindicated by the\n\ndistrict     court    in   the   underlying    desegregation      action.18      No\n\ndiscrete     relief     was   sought    in   this   action   in   favor   of    the\n\nindividual plaintiffs, and none has been awarded for their benefit.\n\nIndeed, given that the DCSS is funding all the desegregation\n\nmeasures required by the Constitution, these individuals have\n\nsuffered no injury at all which could be remedied by the invocation\n\n\n\n     18\n      The plaintiffs in the original desegregation litigation\ncould, presumably, have joined the State and its educational\nagencies as defendants in that suit, but they did not do so.\nSee, e.g., Stanley v. Darlington County School District, 84 F.3d\n707, 717 (4th Cir.1996).\n\fof Title VI.19\n      It must be emphasized that we are not being called upon to\n\nadjudicate       the    rights    of   minority    students       and     parents   to    a\n\nquality, unified educational system in DeKalb County.                            As just\n\nnoted, those rights have been vindicated in the desegregation\n\nlawsuit, and the district court has now declared the DCSS to be a\n\nunitary school system, a determination which is not on appeal. The\n\nplaintiffs       in     this   action     sought   only     a    monetary       award    to\n\ncompensate DeKalb for some of its past desegregative transportation\n\nand other program costs and an injunction to require the State to\n\nhelp fund those initiatives in the future.                      In other words, this\n\ncase is simply about who will pay for the measures undertaken by\n\nDeKalb to remedy the effects of the past segregation of its public\n\nschools, the taxpayers of DeKalb County alone or the taxpayers of\n\nthe state as a whole.\n\n      If       DeKalb    had     sought    this    relief       in   the       underlying\n\ndesegregation suit, it would be more clearly revealed for what it\n\nis:        a   third-party       claim    for   contribution         by    a   political\n\n      19\n      It might be argued that the individual plaintiffs have\nstanding to challenge the State's educational funding practices,\nor failure to fund certain desegregation programs, because, as\nDeKalb County taxpayers, their local property taxes may be\nincreased by the State's actions. Even so, in order to have\nstanding to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must allege an\ninjury in fact distinct from that suffered by all or a large\nclass of citizens. See, e.g., Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n499, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Therefore, with\nrespect to federal taxpayers, the Supreme Court has generally\nfound they lack standing to contest government spending unless\nthe challenge is to government expenditures which allegedly\nviolate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. See\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947\n(1968). The same result has been reached when local taxpayers\nseek to invoke the authority of the federal courts. See Warth,\n422 U.S. at 508-10, 95 S.Ct. at 2210-11.\n\fsubdivision of a state against the sovereign that created it. Yet,\n\na federal court's grant of relief in such an instance would be a\n\nserious violation of the most elementary notions of federalism and\n\ncomity. A state's power to create, abolish and determine the level\n\nof   public   funding   of   political   subdivisions       has    long   been\n\nrecognized as an element of state sovereignty.         See, e.g., City of\n\nTrenton v. State of New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 186, 43 S.Ct. 534,\n\n536, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923).     As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nobserved in a similar case involving the funding of local school\n\ndesegregation measures, \"[i]t would be an unfathomable intrusion\n\ninto a state's affairs—and a violation of the most basic notions of\n\nfederalism—for a federal court to determine the allocation of a\n\nstate's financial resources.        The legislative debate over such\n\nallocation is uniquely an exercise of state sovereignty.\"             Stanley\n\nv.   Darlington   County   School   District,   84   F.3d   707,    716   (4th\n\nCir.1996); see also Harris v. Angelina County, Texas, 31 F.3d 331,\n\n340 (5th Cir.1994) (\"we can think of few greater intrusions on\n\nstate sovereignty than requiring a state to respond, in federal\n\ncourt, to a claim for contribution brought by one of its own\n\ncounties\"), Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education of\n\nNashville & Davidson County, 836 F.2d 986, 998 (6th Cir.1987),\n\ncert. denied, 487 U.S. 1206, 108 S.Ct. 2848, 101 L.Ed.2d 885 (1988)\n\n(federal court may not \"be called upon to adjudicate an internal\n\ndispute [over local school funding] between a local governmental\n\nentity and the very state that created it\").         As a consequence of\n\nthese jurisprudential barriers, the district court's monetary award\n\nfor transportation costs against the State cannot stand.\n\f2. Prospective Injunctive Relief.\n\n      The State also stresses that its arguments concerning Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity and standing apply with equal force to the\n\ndistrict court's grant of injunctive relief. It calls attention to\n\nthe fact that it has been enjoined to adhere to a state funding\n\nstatute as that statute has been interpreted by a federal court.\n\nThe   result   will    not   be   any    enhancement   of   the   desegregation\n\nprograms in DeKalb County, which are already being funded by DeKalb\n\nas the Constitution requires, but, rather, a reallocation of\n\nresources from poorer, rural school districts to a wealthier\n\nsuburban district.          According to the State, this is beyond the\n\npower of the federal courts.            As with the damages award, the State\n\nattacks DeKalb's standing to advance a Fourteenth Amendment or\n\nTitle VI claim against it.\n\n      Moreover,       the    State      challenges   the    district   court's\n\ninterpretation of the transportation funding statute at issue here.\n\nIt takes the position that, since the early 1960's, when nearly\n\nevery Georgia student attended his neighborhood school, or school\n\nfor the attendance zone in which he resided, the statute has been\n\nconstrued consistently to provide transportation funding only for\n\nstudents residing more than one and one-half miles from their\n\nneighborhood school based on the distance between their homes and\n\nthat school.      Finally, the State argues that DeKalb has failed to\n\nidentify any nonmonetary injury which it has suffered as a result\n\nof the State's interpretation of the statute.\n\n      In support of the district court's grant of injunctive relief,\n\nDeKalb asserts that such a prospective remedy fits within the\n\fexception to Eleventh Amendment immunity recognized in Ex parte\n\nYoung, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).        DeKalb\n\npoints to a number of cases where states have been ordered to help\n\npay for the costs of desegregating local schools and have been\n\nenjoined to help fashion remedies for past segregation.\n\n        In    Young,    the    Supreme   Court     carved     out   a\n\n\"prospective-compliance\" exception to the jurisdictional bar of the\n\nEleventh Amendment, holding that a federal court could enjoin state\n\nofficials \"who threaten and are about to commence proceedings ...\n\nto enforce ... an unconstitutional act....\"      209 U.S. at 156, 28\n\nS.Ct. at 452. The exception permits federal courts to enjoin state\n\nofficials to conform their conduct to the requirements of federal\n\nlaw, even if there is an ancillary impact on the state treasury.\n\nSee, e.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749,\n\n2762, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977).     When, however, \"the action is in\n\nessence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is\n\nthe real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke\n\nits [Eleventh Amendment] immunity from suit even though individual\n\nofficials are nominal defendants.\" Ford Motor Co. v. Department of\n\nTreasury of Indiana, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350, 89 L.Ed.\n\n389 (1945);   Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101, 104 S.Ct. at 908.    A suit\n\nthat is essentially one against the state is \"barred regardless of\n\nwhether it seeks damages or injunctive relief.\"       Pennhurst, 465\n\nU.S. at 101-02, 104 S.Ct. at 909;   see Cory v. White, 457 U.S. 85,\n\n102 S.Ct. 2325, 72 L.Ed.2d 694 (1982).\n\n      While a number of state officials are named as defendants in\n\nthis case in addition to the State of Georgia and its agencies, it\n\fis obvious that this is, in reality, a suit against the State\n\nitself.      The only action the defendants are required to take to\n\ncomply with the district court's injunction is to pay from the\n\nstate treasury the additional funds specified by the district\n\ncourt.    If the defendant state officials make those payments, they\n\nwill not be in contempt of the court's order;             if they fail to do\n\nso, such failure will constitute contempt. Therefore, as the Sixth\n\nCircuit found in Kelley, the injunctive relief is ancillary only to\n\nitself and does not fall within the Young exception.               Thus, this\n\naction is, in substance, one against the state, a proceeding barred\n\nby the Eleventh Amendment.\n\n     It is true, as DeKalb points out, that some states have been\n\nordered by federal courts to help fund local desegregation efforts.\n\nThey cite cases involving the desegregation of the Little Rock,\n\nArkansas,     Detroit,   Michigan     and   St.    Louis,    Missouri   school\n\ndistricts, in which state governments were ordered to participate\n\nin desegregation remedies. The district court found, however, that\n\nthe state governments in each of those cases had far greater\n\nresponsibility for primary and secondary education and much more\n\nauthority over the local school districts. In addition, the states\n\nor   state    agencies   in   those    cases      had   participated    in   the\n\ndesegregation litigation since its inception.               See, e.g., Little\n\nRock School District v. Pulaski County Special School District No.\n\n1, 778 F.2d 404, 411-17 (8th Cir.1985) (Little Rock school case);\n\nBradley v. Milliken, 540 F.2d 229, 232-34 (6th Cir.1976) (Detroit\n\nschool case);     United States v. State of Missouri, 515 F.2d 1365\n\n(8th Cir.1975) (St. Louis school case).\n\f     On the other hand, federal courts have refused to require\n\nstate participation in desegregation remedies when the state's\n\nparticipation      was   only    sought    years       after     the     original\n\ndesegregation     litigation    was   initiated    and    when    the     primary\n\nresponsibility for public education rested with the local school\n\nboards.      The case factually closest to the present case is Kelley\n\nv. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville & Davidson\n\nCounty, 836 F.2d 986.       In Kelley, the Metropolitan County Board of\n\nEducation of Nashville and Davidson County sued the State of\n\nTennessee some 26 years after the filing of a desegregation suit\n\ninvolving Nashville and Davidson County seeking reimbursement for\n\nits past desegregation costs and injunctive relief to compel the\n\nState to fund future desegregation efforts.              The district court\n\nconcluded that a retroactive award for past costs would violate the\n\nEleventh Amendment but did enjoin the State to pay for 60% of the\n\nlocal district's future desegregation costs.\n\n     On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the\n\ngrant   of    prospective   relief    violated   the    Eleventh       Amendment.\n\nKelley, 836 F.2d at 988.        The court noted that the case before it\n\nwas not about the merits of desegregation or various methods for\n\nachieving that goal, but simply a contest about money, about who\n\nwould pay the bill for desegregation measures already in effect.\n\nId. at 990.      According to the court, the fact that the state had\n\nbeen a constitutional wrongdoer prior to 1956 did not mean it\n\nremained a constitutional wrongdoer more than 30 years later.                 Id.\n\nat 994.      Furthermore, while the state might have an obligation to\n\neliminate the lingering effects of de jure segregation, federal law\n\fdid not require that the obligation be discharged by payments\n\ndirectly from the state treasury rather than through funds raised\n\nby the local school authorities.            Id.\n\n      A   similar     result   was   reached      in    United   States     v.   Texas\n\nEducation Agency, 790 F.2d 1262 (5th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479\n\nU.S. 1030, 107 S.Ct. 874, 93 L.Ed.2d 828 (1987).                 In that case, the\n\nLubbock Independent School District filed a motion to divide the\n\ncosts of its desegregation measures with the state some 14 years\n\nafter the original lawsuit was filed.                  The district court denied\n\nthe motion, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.                        In\n\nthe view of that court, the case constituted \"the LISD's belated\n\neffort to recover costs which smacks of an attempted end-run around\n\nthe Texas legislature's allocation of state funds.                    Yet the State\n\nhas not been an active party to his suit since 1970, and it has\n\nnever been adjudicated responsible for that segregation in Lubbock\n\nwhich has proven costly to eliminate.\"                 Id. at 1265.\n\n      Finally, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected\n\nefforts to impose on the State of South Carolina some of the costs\n\nof   desegregating      the    Darlington    County       schools.      Stanley    v.\n\nDarlington    County     School   District,       84    F.3d   707.     There,    the\n\ndistrict court had permitted the local district to join the State\n\nas   a    defendant     approximately       30    years     after     the   original\n\ndesegregation lawsuit was filed and had ordered the State to pay\n\n15% of the costs of the relief granted in the case.                   The appellate\n\ncourt reversed, concluding that the district court had wrongfully\n\njoined the State in the litigation where neither the original\n\nplaintiffs nor the United States as intervenor had sought to pursue\n\fa claim against the State.     Id. at 715-16.   The court held that a\n\nfederal court lacked authority to entertain a contribution claim by\n\na local school district against the State.      Id. at 716-17.\n\n     In this case, DeKalb filed suit against the State over 20\n\nyears after the desegregation case against it began in an effort to\n\nshift the burden for some of the costs of its desegregation\n\nmeasures to the State and, by extension, the state's taxpayers at\n\nlarge.     That effort is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and\n\nelementary principles of federalism.\n\n        While the parties have not addressed it, there appears to be\n\nan additional problem with a grant of prospective relief in this\n\ncase.    While federal courts have broad equitable powers to remedy\n\nthe wrongs caused by de jure segregation, \"it is important to\n\nremember that judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of\n\na constitutional violation.\"    Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board\n\nof Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554,\n\n566 (1971).   Further, \"[a]s with any equity case, the nature of the\n\nviolation determines the scope of the remedy.\"       Id.   Therefore,\n\nonce a local school district has achieved unitary status, the role\n\nof the district court comes to an end.   See generally Pasadena City\n\nBoard of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49\n\nL.Ed.2d 599 (1976).    Thus, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has\n\nrefused to approve additional equitable relief once a school\n\ndistrict achieved unitary status.    According to that court,\n\n     accommodation of federal superintendence and federalism will\n     not tolerate the idea that although the wrong is righted, the\n     magnitude of the past wrong nonetheless justifies perpetuation\n     of a federal order limiting the ambit of a school district's\n     self-governance. It is state government that we are asked to\n     enjoin.   Surely, faithfulness to federalism counsels that\n\f     having righted the wrong, the limits we will impose on the\n     state can be drawn no more tightly than the limits of the\n     Constitution.\n\nUnited States v. Overton, 834 F.2d 1171, 1177 (5th Cir.1987).\n\n         In this case, the district court has enjoined the State to\n\nalter its interpretation of a state statute in order to provide\n\nDeKalb    with   additional    state    funding    for   its    desegregative\n\ntransportation     programs.      Yet,    the     district     court    in   the\n\ndesegregation case concluded that DeKalb had achieved unitary\n\nstatus with respect to transportation in 1988, a holding not\n\nappealed by the plaintiffs, and that court recently found that the\n\nDCSS was unitary in all aspects of its operations.             Like the Fifth\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals, we do not believe that the prospective\n\ninjunctive relief granted in this case can be reconciled with a\n\nfinding that the DCSS has achieved unitary status.20             In our view,\n\na federal court lacks authority to compel compliance with such an\n\nindeterminate prospective order once the Constitutional violation\n\nhas been remedied.     For these reasons, the district court's grant\n\nof injunctive relief to DeKalb requiring the State to fund DeKalb's\n\nfuture transportation costs must be reversed.\n\nB. Plaintiffs' Appeal.\n\n     DeKalb appeals the district court's rejection of its request\n\nfor reimbursement for some of its non-transportation desegregation\n\ncosts.      In   its   opinion,   the    State's    history     of     enforcing\n\n\n     20\n      For the same reason, we doubt that the district court had\nauthority to award DeKalb its past desegregative transportation\nexpenses once DeKalb had been found to be unitary with respect to\nits transportation operations. Since we have decided, however,\nthat the district court's award of such expenses must be reversed\non other grounds, we need not reach that issue.\n\fsegregation renders it liable for at least some of DeKalb's costs\n\nin desegregating its schools.\n\n      As stated above, the district court found that DeKalb was\n\nprimarily      responsible     for   operating    its     public    schools    and,\n\nfurther, that the State had not impeded DeKalb's M to M or magnet\n\nschool programs.       Therefore, as a factual matter, the State could\n\nnot     be   held    liable   for    DeKalb's    costs     in   developing     and\n\nimplementing those desegregation programs.                Furthermore, for the\n\nreasons      discussed   earlier     respecting     DeKalb's       transportation\n\nexpenses, the State may not be required legally to contribute to\n\nthose costs.        DeKalb has not cited any case where there was a\n\nsimilar division of responsibility for public education, and where\n\nliability for desegregation costs was sought to be imposed on state\n\ngovernment years after the initiation of such efforts, which held\n\nthe state financially responsible for local school desegregation\n\nefforts.      The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth\n\nCircuits have rejected such claims for state contribution in\n\nsimilar circumstances, and we feel compelled to follow their\n\ncourse.       Stanley, 84 F.3d at 716-17;            United States v. Texas\n\nEducation Agency, 790 F.2d at 1264-65;              Kelley, 836 F.2d at 988-\n\n1001.        The   district   court's   rejection    of    DeKalb's    claim   for\n\nprogrammatic costs is therefore affirmed.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part and\n\nREVERSED in part.\n\f",

The United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia awarded the plaintiffs the desegregative transportation costs they sought and ordered the State of Georgia to fund those future transportation expenses.  The district court disallowed, however, the plaintiffs' recovery of the costs of their \"majority to minority\" transfer<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and magnet school desegregation programs.  The state defendants appeal the district court's adverse ruling on the transportation issue, and the DeKalb County plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal to the district court's rejection of their claim for their programmatic costs.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, we reverse the district court's judgment granting transportation costs to the plaintiffs and affirm its ruling in favor of the defendants denying the plaintiffs' recovery of their costs incurred in the other desegregation undertakings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND OF THIS APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>A. The Desegregation Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeKalb County, Georgia, is a suburban area adjacent to and east of Atlanta.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The DeKalb County Board of Education (\"DCBE\") operates the DeKalb County School System (\"DCSS\"), the schools within the DeKalb County School District, which, at all times relevant to this case, was the largest school district in the State of Georgia.  Consistent with state law and its own policies and those promulgated by the State Board of Education and the State Department of Education, the DCSS historically operated a segregated, dual system of education with separate schools for black and white students.  In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States declared segregated schools unconstitutional in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954), and the following year ordered all such segregated school districts to desegregate with \"all deliberate speed,\" Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 301, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955).  Those rulings notwithstanding, the DCSS did not commence its desegregation efforts until 1966 when it implemented a \"freedom of choice\" plan, pursuant to which some black students attended formerly de jure white schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1968, the Supreme Court decided Green v. County School Board, 391 U.S. 430, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716 (1968), in which the Court held that, if freedom of choice plans failed to adequately end the unlawful segregation of a school district, other means must be utilized to achieve that purpose.  Within two months, a class of black students filed suit against the DCSS.  In June, 1969, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an order which abolished the freedom of choice plan and enjoined the DCSS from further discrimination on the basis of race.  The court ordered the DCSS to close all remaining de jure black schools and to establish a neighborhood school attendance policy.  The court retained jurisdiction to ensure compliance with its order.  See Pitts v. Cherry, C.A. No. 11946 (N.D.Ga. June 12, 1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties did not seek any modification of the 1969 order or request additional relief until 1975 when the plaintiffs complained that DCSS had violated the earlier plan.  In 1976, the district court ordered the DCSS to expand its \"majority to minority\" (\"M to M\") transfer system of assignment, pursuant to which a student could transfer from any school in which his or her race was in the majority to a school in which that race was in the minority, by providing free transportation to the students, and to reassign faculty and staff members so that the racial percentages at each school would approximate those in the system at large.  In the late 1970's, the district court considered several plan modifications, not relevant to this litigation, requested by the DCSS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1983, the plaintiffs sought additional relief in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  In an order entered following a hearing on the plaintiffs' request, the district court, apparently relying on its 1969 order in the case, asserted that the DCSS had been converted from a dual to a unitary school system in that year.  The plaintiffs appealed to this court, which held that the district court had improperly declared the DCSS to be unitary without notifying the plaintiffs and conducting a hearing on that issue.  Pitts v. Freeman, 755 F.2d 1423 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1986, the DCSS filed a motion seeking final dismissal of the case, and the district court conducted a three-week bench trial in July, 1987 to determine whether the system had indeed achieved unitary status.  In an order entered June 30, 1988, the district court denied the DCSS's motion, concluding that vestiges of the dual system remained in staff assignments, resource allocation and quality of education.  The court found, however, that the system had become unitary with regard to student assignments, transportation, physical facilities and extracurricular activities.  Accordingly, the court decided that no further relief was necessary in those areas.  The district court certified its order for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b), and both sides sought review in this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellate panel affirmed the district court's judgment that the DCSS had not fulfilled its responsibilities with respect to faculty and staff assignments but reversed its finding that the DCSS had met its obligations in the assignment of students.  The court also held that a school system could not be declared unitary until it had maintained racial equality for a period of three years in all of the categories identified by the Supreme Court in Green.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The court, therefore, determined that the DCSS was not being operated as a unitary system.  Pitts v. Freeman, 887 F.2d 1438, 1450 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The DCSS petitioned the Supreme Court for review.  In 1992, the Supreme Court reversed this court, holding that a district court is permitted to withdraw judicial supervision with respect to discrete categories in which the school district has achieved compliance with a court-ordered desegregation plan.  See Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 471, 112 S.Ct. 1430, 1436, 118 L.Ed.2d 108 (1992).  According to the Court, \"in the course of supervising desegregation plans, federal courts have the authority to relinquish supervision and control of school districts in incremental stages, before full compliance has been achieved in every area of school operations.\"  Id. at 490, 112 S.Ct. at 1445.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the case before it, the Court held \"the Court of Appeals did err in holding that, as a matter of law, the District Court had no discretion to permit DCSS to regain control over student assignment, transportation, physical facilities, and extracurricular activities, while retaining court supervision over the areas of faculty and administrative assignments and the quality of education, where full compliance had not been demonstrated.\"  Id. at 492, 112 S.Ct. at 1446.   Turning to the question whether continuing judicial control over student attendance was necessary to achieve compliance in other areas of the system's operations, the Court noted that the district court, not having its analysis before it, did not have the opportunity to make specific findings and conclusions on this aspect of the case and stated that \"[f]urther proceedings are appropriate for this purpose.\"  Id. at 498, 112 S.Ct. at 1449.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complying with the Supreme Court's mandate, this court remanded the case to the district court with the following instructions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>The issues to be considered by the district court should include, but not necessarily be limited to, faculty and staff assignments (which may or may not involve a re-examination of student assignments), resource allocation, the quality of education being received by all students and the good faith commitment of the school district.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pitts v.

The court held hearings on these issues in January and March, 1996.  In an order entered June 12, 1996, the district court stated that it would \"not revisit those ... factors in which a unitary system has already been held to exist.  Rather, the court will address only those issues left open by the 1988 Order, and the appellate and Supreme Court review of that order.\"  Mills v. Freeman, 942 F.Supp. 1449, 1454 (N.D.Ga.1996).  Thus, the court considered on the merits only the issues of faculty assignments, quality of education, and the DCSS's good faith.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The court concluded that the DCSS had achieved unitary status in all respects and granted its motion for final dismissal of the case.  Id. at 1463-64.   No appeal has been taken from that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>B. History of this Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit was filed in 1990 by the DeKalb County School District, the members of the DeKalb County Board of Education, and several parents and students (hereinafter collectively \"DeKalb\") against the State of Georgia, the Governor, the State Board of Education and its members, the State Superintendent of Schools, the State Department of Education and several other state officials (collectively the \"State\") seeking to recover its past transportation and other expenses related to its desegregation efforts.  In addition, as stated earlier, DeKalb sought injunctive relief requiring the State to help fund its future desegregation expenses.  It contended that the State's efforts to impede integration violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution;  the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1701-1758, which, inter alia, bars a state education agency from segregating students on the basis of race, color or national origin and requires an agency which has practiced such segregation to take affirmative steps to remove the vestiges of a dual school system;  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in any governmental program that is the recipient of federal funds;  and certain provisions of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to the court in July 1993.  The evidence at trial disclosed that the State funds a portion of each local school district's educational expenditures depending on a number of factors including, since 1985, the wealth of the local district.  The State partially reimburses local districts for their transportation expenses based on a formula in use since the early 1960's.  Every three years, using maps supplied by the local districts plotting the location of students residing more than 1 and  1/2 miles from their assigned or neighborhood school, state officials draw \"ideal\" bus routes which will collect those students and deliver them most efficiently to that school.  They then calculate the number of route miles and buses needed to transport those students using these ideal routes and determine the amount each district will be allocated for transportation expenses.  These calculations are made without regard to the actual schools to which any of the students are assigned or to the local district's actual bus routes or transportation expenses.  Consequently, the State does not compensate DeKalb, or any other local district in the state, for the additional expense incurred in transporting the students in its magnet school and M to M transfer programs, who frequently reside long distances from the schools which they attend.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law in an order dated September 23, 1994.  The court observed that the State had vigorously resisted the integration of its public schools and had adopted a number of statutes and policies over the years in an effort to preserve segregated schools.  The court noted that in the 1960's the State had refused to fund transportation for students outside their local attendance zone except for white students seeking to attend white schools under freedom-of-choice plans.  (Order at 6-7).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  When compulsory busing began to be used to desegregate schools, the State Department of Education adopted in 1972 Policy ED(1)G, which provided that student transportation funds were to be calculated using the school nearest the student's residence having space in the appropriate grade.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The court found that this policy was adopted to discourage desegregative student transfers.  (Id. at 11-12).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In 1990, DeKalb requested that the State fund the additional transportation expenses required by its magnet and M to M transfer programs.  The State refused, citing Policy ED(1)G and other policies.  The district court found that Policy ED(1)G was repealed in 1991.  It apparently was replaced by a similar provision, a rule adopted by the State Board of Education in November 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the State's system of calculating reimbursable transportation expenses is not consistent with O.C.G.A. &#167; 20-2-188(d), which directs in part that students \"who live beyond one and one-half miles from the school to which they are assigned ... shall be eligible to be counted as transported students....\"  From this, the court held that the State's transportation funding policy violates this provision of state law, the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court found, however, that the State had not violated the Equal Educational Opportunity Act.  (Id. at 20-28).   Using figures supplied by DeKalb<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and not disputed by the State, the court held that DeKalb was due \"$24,632,351 in transportation monies that should have been paid pursuant to state law.\"  (Id. at 43).   The court enjoined the State from ignoring magnet and M to M transfer students in its future calculation of transportation funding and ordered the State to base its computation on each student's actual school assignment.  (Id. at 23).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to DeKalb's request for reimbursement for its magnet school and M to M programs, the district court found that, under Georgia law, DeKalb was primarily responsible for the operation of its public schools and, therefore, for remedying the effects of its earlier dual school system.  The court noted that there was \"no evidence ... to suggest that DeKalb's M to M or magnet programs were ever hindered or interfered with by the state or state officials in their initial voluntary form or in their judicially modified form.\"  (Order at 19).  The court observed that a three-judge panel had in an earlier lawsuit \"found that no acts on the part of the state had been shown to foster a segregative condition since approximately 1964.\"  (Id. at 32, citing Armour v. Nix, No. 16708, at 7 &amp; 27 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 24, 1979), aff'd, 446 U.S. 930, 100 S.Ct. 2146, 64 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980)).  The court further observed that the Supreme Court had affirmed its finding that the DCSS was unitary with respect to transportation and three other of the six factors identified by the Court in Green.   On this record, the court concluded that it could not \"order the state to participate in a remedy for the removal of a vestige of the dual school system which the court has already declared removed.\"  (Id. at 30).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Therefore, the court refused to order the State to compensate the DCSS for its programmatic desegregation expenses.  The court distinguished cases cited by the plaintiffs where state governments had been ordered to pay for desegregation efforts on the ground that those states had much greater responsibility for and authority over local schools.  Moreover, the court found that, in those cases, the state or state agencies had been involved in the desegregation litigation from the beginning.  Here, in contrast, the DCSS had been under court supervision for over 20 years before filing this action against the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both DeKalb and the State filed motions to alter or amend the judgment.  In response to the State's motion, the district court clarified its order to specify that its award of damages to DeKalb was based on federal, not state, law, thereby avoiding the bar posed by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.  According to the court, it had used state law simply to measure the damages due DeKalb.  The court reiterated, however, its finding that the State had not violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act because \"the transportation policy is not a vestige of the dual school system....\"  (Order dated December 19, 1994, at 8) (emphasis in original).  As a consequence of DeKalb's motion, the court awarded the plaintiffs an additional $9,259,257 in transportation expenses for the 1993 and 1994 fiscal years.  These appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's findings of fact may not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a);  Robinson v. City of Fairfield, 750 F.2d 1507, 1510 (11th Cir.1985).  Its conclusions of law are subject to de novo review by this court.  Veale v. Citibank, F.S.B., 85 F.3d 577, 579 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>A. Defendants' Appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Retrospective Monetary Relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State urges that the district court's monetary damages violate the Eleventh Amendment and settled principles of comity and federalism.  It notes that the court's September 23, 1994, order repeatedly states that DeKalb is due compensation for the State's violation of O.C.G.A. &#167; 20-2-188, a holding that is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  While conceding that the district court clarified its order by relying on the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI rather than the state statute as the basis for its award, the State argues that it is, in substance, one for the violation of state law.  It also insists that the district court's decision abridges the political integrity of the State by reallocating a tax burden between DeKalb County taxpayers and those who bear the tax burden in the state-at-large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State also maintains that Title VI does not support the award of damages in this case.  While admitting that Congress has abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to actions brought pursuant to Title VI, the defendants assert that this case is far from a legitimate Title VI action.  It alleges that DeKalb County, as a subordinate creation of the state, lacks standing to bring this action against the State.  Moreover, noting that this case is simply one for allocating a tax burden, not for substantive relief under the civil rights laws, the State claims that the individual plaintiffs here also lack standing to seek relief against the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that \"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"   Over a century ago, the Supreme Court made clear that this language also barred suits against a state by its own citizens.  See Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890).  In short, the Eleventh Amendment constitutes an \"absolute bar\" to a state's being sued by its own citizens, among others.  See Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 329, 54 S.Ct. 745, 750, 78 L.Ed. 1282 (1934).  In the view of the Supreme Court, the principle of sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment is a broad, fundamental one, which is \"among the most stable in our constitutional jurisprudence.\" Welch v. State Department of Highways, 483 U.S. 468, 486, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2952, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987).  The doctrine plays a vital role in our federal system by preventing the sensitive problems which would result from compelling one sovereign to appear in the courts of the other against its will.  Id. at 486-87, 107 S.Ct. at 2952.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For that reason, absent its consent, a state may not be sued in federal court unless Congress has clearly and unequivocally abrogated the state's Eleventh Amendment immunity by exercising its power with respect to rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 104 S.Ct. 900, 907, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984).  Of course, Congress may not nullify a state's immunity with respect to alleged violations of state law.  For that reason, a federal court may not entertain a cause of action against a state for alleged violations of state law, even if that state claim is pendent to a federal claim which the district court could adjudicate.  Id. at 117-23, 104 S.Ct. at 917-20.   According to the Supreme Court, \"[a] federal court's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law.  On the contrary, it is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.  Such a result conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, DeKalb invoked the jurisdiction of the district court by asserting that the State's conduct violated federal rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act.  As far as transportation funding is concerned, however, the gravamen of its complaint appears to be that the State has improperly interpreted and failed to adhere to a state statute governing reimbursement for transportation costs.  As was noted earlier, the district court's order concluded that DeKalb was due additional \"transportation monies that should have been paid pursuant to state law.\"   It is uncontroverted that the damages awarded to DeKalb in this case was measured by application of the disputed Georgia statutory provision, O.C.G.A. &#167; 20-2-188(d).  DeKalb's discussion of this issue in its brief before us is almost entirely devoted to state law.  Looking at the substance of the district court's judgment, it appears to be one for violation of state law, a holding barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  See Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Replying to the State's post-judgment motion, the district court modified its initial decision to rest its judgment more clearly on its finding that the State had violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI.  Even if we assume that the district court's disposition is based on federal law, the judgment in favor of DeKalb must still overcome the Eleventh Amendment barrier.  The Supreme Court has found no general abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity for claims brought pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979).  On the other hand, the parties agree that Congress has abolished the states' immunity for causes of action grounded in Title VI.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Thus, the State could be forced to defend a Title VI action in federal court without its consent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VI provides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  While Title VI is not itself an independent source of federal funding, it bars discrimination in over 80 federal programs which provide financial assistance to state and local educational activities.  See 34 C.F.R. Pt. 100, App.  A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In spite of this bar, it does not appear that any of the plaintiffs here have standing to sue the State for a violation of Title VI.  First, it is now clearly the law in this circuit that a political subdivision of a state, such as the DeKalb County School District and its Board of Education, may not maintain a suit for a breach of Title VI against the State in federal court.  In U.S. v. Alabama, 791 F.2d 1450, 1455-57 (11th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1085, 107 S.Ct. 1287, 94 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987), a panel of this court held that a state university lacked standing to sue the sovereign that created it under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Furthermore, the court concluded that a state university was not a \"person\" with rights under Title VI which could be vindicated in a lawsuit against the state.  Id.;  see also Knight v. Alabama, 14 F.3d 1534, 1554 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeKalb counters that the plaintiffs can circumvent this obstacle because there are individual citizens who are plaintiffs in this case.  The Supreme Court has recognized a private right of action for individuals injured by a Title VI violation.  See Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 696-97, 99 S.Ct. 1946, 1957-58, 60 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979).  Nonetheless, the individual plaintiffs here appear to be only nominally interested in the outcome of this action.  The legitimate interests of those individuals are in an integrated educational system in DeKalb County which complies with the requirements of the Constitution, and their rights in those matters have been vindicated by the district court in the underlying desegregation action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  No discrete relief was sought in this action in favor of the individual plaintiffs, and none has been awarded for their benefit.  Indeed, given that the DCSS is funding all the desegregation measures required by the Constitution, these individuals have suffered no injury at all which could be remedied by the invocation of Title VI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must be emphasized that we are not being called upon to adjudicate the rights of minority students and parents to a quality, unified educational system in DeKalb County.  As just noted, those rights have been vindicated in the desegregation lawsuit, and the district court has now declared the DCSS to be a unitary school system, a determination which is not on appeal.  The plaintiffs in this action sought only a monetary award to compensate DeKalb for some of its past desegregative transportation and other program costs and an injunction to require the State to help fund those initiatives in the future.  In other words, this case is simply about who will pay for the measures undertaken by DeKalb to remedy the effects of the past segregation of its public schools, the taxpayers of DeKalb County alone or the taxpayers of the state as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If DeKalb had sought this relief in the underlying desegregation suit, it would be more clearly revealed for what it is:  a third-party claim for contribution by a political subdivision of a state against the sovereign that created it.  Yet, a federal court's grant of relief in such an instance would be a serious violation of the most elementary notions of federalism and comity.  A state's power to create, abolish and determine the level of public funding of political subdivisions has long been recognized as an element of state sovereignty.  See, e.g., City of Trenton v. State of New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 186, 43 S.Ct. 534, 536, 67 L.Ed. 937 (1923).  As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals observed in a similar case involving the funding of local school desegregation measures, \"[i]t would be an unfathomable intrusion into a state's affairs--and a violation of the most basic notions of federalism--for a federal court to determine the allocation of a state's financial resources.  The legislative debate over such allocation is uniquely an exercise of state sovereignty.\"  Stanley v. Darlington County School District, 84 F.3d 707, 716 (4th Cir.1996);  see also Harris v. Angelina County, Texas, 31 F.3d 331, 340 (5th Cir.1994) (\"we can think of few greater intrusions on state sovereignty than requiring a state to respond, in federal court, to a claim for contribution brought by one of its own counties\"), Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, 836 F.2d 986, 998 (6th Cir.1987), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1206, 108 S.Ct. 2848, 101 L.Ed.2d 885 (1988) (federal court may not \"be called upon to adjudicate an internal dispute [over local school funding] between a local governmental entity and the very state that created it\").  As a consequence of these jurisprudential barriers, the district court's monetary award for transportation costs against the State cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Prospective Injunctive Relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State also stresses that its arguments concerning Eleventh Amendment immunity and standing apply with equal force to the district court's grant of injunctive relief.  It calls attention to the fact that it has been enjoined to adhere to a state funding statute as that statute has been interpreted by a federal court.  The result will not be any enhancement of the desegregation programs in DeKalb County, which are already being funded by DeKalb as the Constitution requires, but, rather, a reallocation of resources from poorer, rural school districts to a wealthier suburban district.  According to the State, this is beyond the power of the federal courts.  As with the damages award, the State attacks DeKalb's standing to advance a Fourteenth Amendment or Title VI claim against it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the State challenges the district court's interpretation of the transportation funding statute at issue here.  It takes the position that, since the early 1960's, when nearly every Georgia student attended his neighborhood school, or school for the attendance zone in which he resided, the statute has been construed consistently to provide transportation funding only for students residing more than one and one-half miles from their neighborhood school based on the distance between their homes and that school.  Finally, the State argues that DeKalb has failed to identify any nonmonetary injury which it has suffered as a result of the State's interpretation of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the district court's grant of injunctive relief, DeKalb asserts that such a prospective remedy fits within the exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity recognized in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908).  DeKalb points to a number of cases where states have been ordered to help pay for the costs of desegregating local schools and have been enjoined to help fashion remedies for past segregation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Young, the Supreme Court carved out a \"prospective-compliance\" exception to the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment, holding that a federal court could enjoin state officials \"who threaten and are about to commence proceedings ... to enforce ... an unconstitutional act....\"  209 U.S. at 156, 28 S.Ct. at 452.   The exception permits federal courts to enjoin state officials to conform their conduct to the requirements of federal law, even if there is an ancillary impact on the state treasury.  See, e.g., Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.S. 267, 289, 97 S.Ct. 2749, 2762, 53 L.Ed.2d 745 (1977).  When, however, \"the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its [Eleventh Amendment] immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.\"  Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Indiana, 323 U.S. 459, 464, 65 S.Ct. 347, 350, 89 L.Ed. 389 (1945);  Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101, 104 S.Ct. at 908.   A suit that is essentially one against the state is \"barred regardless of whether it seeks damages or injunctive relief.\"  Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 101-02, 104 S.Ct. at 909;  see Cory v. White, 457 U.S. 85, 102 S.Ct. 2325, 72 L.Ed.2d 694 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While a number of state officials are named as defendants in this case in addition to the State of Georgia and its agencies, it is obvious that this is, in reality, a suit against the State itself.  The only action the defendants are required to take to comply with the district court's injunction is to pay from the state treasury the additional funds specified by the district court.  If the defendant state officials make those payments, they will not be in contempt of the court's order;  if they fail to do so, such failure will constitute contempt.  Therefore, as the Sixth Circuit found in Kelley, the injunctive relief is ancillary only to itself and does not fall within the Young exception.  Thus, this action is, in substance, one against the state, a proceeding barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as DeKalb points out, that some states have been ordered by federal courts to help fund local desegregation efforts.  They cite cases involving the desegregation of the Little Rock, Arkansas, Detroit, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri school districts, in which state governments were ordered to participate in desegregation remedies.  The district court found, however, that the state governments in each of those cases had far greater responsibility for primary and secondary education and much more authority over the local school districts.  In addition, the states or state agencies in those cases had participated in the desegregation litigation since its inception.  See, e.g., Little Rock School District v. Pulaski County Special School District No. 1, 778 F.2d 404, 411-17 (8th Cir.1985) (Little Rock school case);  Bradley v. Milliken, 540 F.2d 229, 232-34 (6th Cir.1976) (Detroit school case);  United States v. State of Missouri, 515 F.2d 1365 (8th Cir.1975) (St. Louis school case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, federal courts have refused to require state participation in desegregation remedies when the state's participation was only sought years after the original desegregation litigation was initiated and when the primary responsibility for public education rested with the local school boards.  The case factually closest to the present case is Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, 836 F.2d 986.   In Kelley, the Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville and Davidson County sued the State of Tennessee some 26 years after the filing of a desegregation suit involving Nashville and Davidson County seeking reimbursement for its past desegregation costs and injunctive relief to compel the State to fund future desegregation efforts.  The district court concluded that a retroactive award for past costs would violate the Eleventh Amendment but did enjoin the State to pay for 60% of the local district's future desegregation costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the grant of prospective relief violated the Eleventh Amendment.  Kelley, 836 F.2d at 988.   The court noted that the case before it was not about the merits of desegregation or various methods for achieving that goal, but simply a contest about money, about who would pay the bill for desegregation measures already in effect.  Id. at 990.   According to the court, the fact that the state had been a constitutional wrongdoer prior to 1956 did not mean it remained a constitutional wrongdoer more than 30 years later.  Id. at 994.   Furthermore, while the state might have an obligation to eliminate the lingering effects of de jure segregation, federal law did not require that the obligation be discharged by payments directly from the state treasury rather than through funds raised by the local school authorities.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar result was reached in United States v. Texas Education Agency, 790 F.2d 1262 (5th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1030, 107 S.Ct. 874, 93 L.Ed.2d 828 (1987).  In that case, the Lubbock Independent School District filed a motion to divide the costs of its desegregation measures with the state some 14 years after the original lawsuit was filed.  The district court denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.  In the view of that court, the case constituted \"the LISD's belated effort to recover costs which smacks of an attempted end-run around the Texas legislature's allocation of state funds.  Yet the State has not been an active party to his suit since 1970, and it has never been adjudicated responsible for that segregation in Lubbock which has proven costly to eliminate.\"  Id. at 1265.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals recently rejected efforts to impose on the State of South Carolina some of the costs of desegregating the Darlington County schools.  Stanley v. Darlington County School District, 84 F.3d 707.   There, the district court had permitted the local district to join the State as a defendant approximately 30 years after the original desegregation lawsuit was filed and had ordered the State to pay 15% of the costs of the relief granted in the case.  The appellate court reversed, concluding that the district court had wrongfully joined the State in the litigation where neither the original plaintiffs nor the United States as intervenor had sought to pursue a claim against the State.  Id. at 715-16.   The court held that a federal court lacked authority to entertain a contribution claim by a local school district against the State.  Id. at 716-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, DeKalb filed suit against the State over 20 years after the desegregation case against it began in an effort to shift the burden for some of the costs of its desegregation measures to the State and, by extension, the state's taxpayers at large.  That effort is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and elementary principles of federalism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the parties have not addressed it, there appears to be an additional problem with a grant of prospective relief in this case.  While federal courts have broad equitable powers to remedy the wrongs caused by de jure segregation, \"it is important to remember that judicial powers may be exercised only on the basis of a constitutional violation.\"  Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 1276, 28 L.Ed.2d 554, 566 (1971).  Further, \"[a]s with any equity case, the nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.\"  Id.  Therefore, once a local school district has achieved unitary status, the role of the district court comes to an end.  See generally Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976).  Thus, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has refused to approve additional equitable relief once a school district achieved unitary status.  According to that court,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>accommodation of federal superintendence and federalism will not tolerate the idea that although the wrong is righted, the magnitude of the past wrong nonetheless justifies perpetuation of a federal order limiting the ambit of a school district's self-governance.  It is state government that we are asked to enjoin.  Surely, faithfulness to federalism counsels that having righted the wrong, the limits we will impose on the state can be drawn no more tightly than the limits of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Overton, 834 F.2d 1171, 1177 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court has enjoined the State to alter its interpretation of a state statute in order to provide DeKalb with additional state funding for its desegregative transportation programs.  Yet, the district court in the desegregation case concluded that DeKalb had achieved unitary status with respect to transportation in 1988, a holding not appealed by the plaintiffs, and that court recently found that the DCSS was unitary in all aspects of its operations.  Like the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, we do not believe that the prospective injunctive relief granted in this case can be reconciled with a finding that the DCSS has achieved unitary status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  In our view, a federal court lacks authority to compel compliance with such an indeterminate prospective order once the Constitutional violation has been remedied.  For these reasons, the district court's grant of injunctive relief to DeKalb requiring the State to fund DeKalb's future transportation costs must be reversed.B. Plaintiffs' Appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeKalb appeals the district court's rejection of its request for reimbursement for some of its non-transportation desegregation costs.  In its opinion, the State's history of enforcing segregation renders it liable for at least some of DeKalb's costs in desegregating its schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the district court found that DeKalb was primarily responsible for operating its public schools and, further, that the State had not impeded DeKalb's M to M or magnet school programs.  Therefore, as a factual matter, the State could not be held liable for DeKalb's costs in developing and implementing those desegregation programs.  Furthermore, for the reasons discussed earlier respecting DeKalb's transportation expenses, the State may not be required legally to contribute to those costs.  DeKalb has not cited any case where there was a similar division of responsibility for public education, and where liability for desegregation costs was sought to be imposed on state government years after the initiation of such efforts, which held the state financially responsible for local school desegregation efforts.  The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have rejected such claims for state contribution in similar circumstances, and we feel compelled to follow their course.  Stanley, 84 F.3d at 716-17;  United States v. Texas Education Agency, 790 F.2d at 1264-65;  Kelley, 836 F.2d at 988-1001.

Therefore, with respect to federal taxpayers, the Supreme Court has generally found they lack standing to contest government spending unless the challenge is to government expenditures which allegedly violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  See Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968).  The same result has been reached when local taxpayers seek to invoke the authority of the federal courts.

Within two months, a class of black students filed suit against the DCSS.  In June, 1969, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia entered an order which abolished the freedom of choice plan and enjoined the DCSS from further discrimination on the basis of race.  The court ordered the DCSS to close all remaining de jure black schools and to establish a neighborhood school attendance policy.  The court retained jurisdiction to ensure compliance with its order.  See Pitts v. Cherry, C.A. No. 11946 (N.D.Ga.

In 1976, the district court ordered the DCSS to expand its \"majority to minority\" (\"M to M\") transfer system of assignment, pursuant to which a student could transfer from any school in which his or her race was in the majority to a school in which that race was in the minority, by providing free transportation to the students, and to reassign faculty and staff members so that the racial percentages at each school would approximate those in the system at large.

The plaintiffs appealed to this court, which held that the district court had improperly declared the DCSS to be unitary without notifying the plaintiffs and conducting a hearing on that issue.

In an order entered June 30, 1988, the district court denied the DCSS's motion, concluding that vestiges of the dual system remained in staff assignments, resource allocation and quality of education.  The court found, however, that the system had become unitary with regard to student assignments, transportation, physical facilities and extracurricular activities.  Accordingly, the court decided that no further relief was necessary in those areas.  The district court certified its order for immediate appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b), and both sides sought review in this court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellate panel affirmed the district court's judgment that the DCSS had not fulfilled its responsibilities with respect to faculty and staff assignments but reversed its finding that the DCSS had met its obligations in the assignment of students.

In an order entered June 12, 1996, the district court stated that it would \"not revisit those ... factors in which a unitary system has already been held to exist.

History of this Litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit was filed in 1990 by the DeKalb County School District, the members of the DeKalb County Board of Education, and several parents and students (hereinafter collectively \"DeKalb\") against the State of Georgia, the Governor, the State Board of Education and its members, the State Superintendent of Schools, the State Department of Education and several other state officials (collectively the \"State\") seeking to recover its past transportation and other expenses related to its desegregation efforts.  In addition, as stated earlier, DeKalb sought injunctive relief requiring the State to help fund its future desegregation expenses.  It contended that the State's efforts to impede integration violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution;  the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1701-1758, which, inter alia, bars a state education agency from segregating students on the basis of race, color or national origin and requires an agency which has practiced such segregation to take affirmative steps to remove the vestiges of a dual school system;  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d et seq., which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race in any governmental program that is the recipient of federal funds;  and certain provisions of state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was tried to the court in July 1993.  The evidence at trial disclosed that the State funds a portion of each local school district's educational expenditures depending on a number of factors including, since 1985, the wealth of the local district.  The State partially reimburses local districts for their transportation expenses based on a formula in use since the early 1960's.  Every three years, using maps supplied by the local districts plotting the location of students residing more than 1 and  1/2 miles from their assigned or neighborhood school, state officials draw \"ideal\" bus routes which will collect those students and deliver them most efficiently to that school.  They then calculate the number of route miles and buses needed to transport those students using these ideal routes and determine the amount each district will be allocated for transportation expenses.  These calculations are made without regard to the actual schools to which any of the students are assigned or to the local district's actual bus routes or transportation expenses.  Consequently, the State does not compensate DeKalb, or any other local district in the state, for the additional expense incurred in transporting the students in its magnet school and M to M transfer programs, who frequently reside long distances from the schools which they attend.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court entered its findings of fact and conclusions of law in an order dated September 23, 1994.  The court observed that the State had vigorously resisted the integration of its public schools and had adopted a number of statutes and policies over the years in an effort to preserve segregated schools.  The court noted that in the 1960's the State had refused to fund transportation for students outside their local attendance zone except for white students seeking to attend white schools under freedom-of-choice plans.  (Order at 6-7).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  When compulsory busing began to be used to desegregate schools, the State Department of Education adopted in 1972 Policy ED(1)G, which provided that student transportation funds were to be calculated using the school nearest the student's residence having space in the appropriate grade.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The court found that this policy was adopted to discourage desegregative student transfers.  (Id. at 11-12).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In 1990, DeKalb requested that the State fund the additional transportation expenses required by its magnet and M to M transfer programs.  The State refused, citing Policy ED(1)G and other policies.  The district court found that Policy ED(1)G was repealed in 1991.  It apparently was replaced by a similar provision, a rule adopted by the State Board of Education in November 1990.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the State's system of calculating reimbursable transportation expenses is not consistent with O.C.G.A. &#167; 20-2-188(d), which directs in part that students \"who live beyond one and one-half miles from the school to which they are assigned ... shall be eligible to be counted as transported students....\"  From this, the court held that the State's transportation funding policy violates this provision of state law, the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The court found, however, that the State had not violated the Equal Educational Opportunity Act.  (Id. at 20-28).   Using figures supplied by DeKalb<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> and not disputed by the State, the court held that DeKalb was due \"$24,632,351 in transportation monies that should have been paid pursuant to state law.\"  (Id. at 43).   The court enjoined the State from ignoring magnet and M to M transfer students in its future calculation of transportation funding and ordered the State to base its computation on each student's actual school assignment.  (Id. at 23).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to DeKalb's request for reimbursement for its magnet school and M to M programs, the district court found that, under Georgia law, DeKalb was primarily responsible for the operation of its public schools and, therefore, for remedying the effects of its earlier dual school system.  The court noted that there was \"no evidence ... to suggest that DeKalb's M to M or magnet programs were ever hindered or interfered with by the state or state officials in their initial voluntary form or in their judicially modified form.\"  (Order at 19).  The court observed that a three-judge panel had in an earlier lawsuit \"found that no acts on the part of the state had been shown to foster a segregative condition since approximately 1964.\"  (Id. at 32, citing Armour v. Nix, No. 16708, at 7 &amp; 27 (N.D.Ga. Sept. 24, 1979), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">930</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></span> (1980)).  The court further observed that the Supreme Court had affirmed its finding that the DCSS was unitary with respect to transportation and three other of the six factors identified by the Court in Green.   On this record, the court concluded that it could not \"order the state to participate in a remedy for the removal of a vestige of the dual school system which the court has already declared removed.\"  (Id. at 30).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Therefore, the court refused to order the State to compensate the DCSS for its programmatic desegregation expenses.  The court distinguished cases cited by the plaintiffs where state governments had been ordered to pay for desegregation efforts on the ground that those states had much greater responsibility for and authority over local schools.  Moreover, the court found that, in those cases, the state or state agencies had been involved in the desegregation litigation from the beginning.  Here, in contrast, the DCSS had been under court supervision for over 20 years before filing this action against the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both DeKalb and the State filed motions to alter or amend the judgment.  In response to the State's motion, the district court clarified its order to specify that its award of damages to DeKalb was based on federal, not state, law, thereby avoiding the bar posed by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution.  According to the court, it had used state law simply to measure the damages due DeKalb.  The court reiterated, however, its finding that the State had not violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act because \"the transportation policy is not a vestige of the dual school system....\"  (Order dated December 19, 1994, at 8) (emphasis in original).  As a consequence of DeKalb's motion, the court awarded the plaintiffs an additional $9,259,257 in transportation expenses for the 1993 and 1994 fiscal years.

Retrospective Monetary Relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State urges that the district court's monetary damages violate the Eleventh Amendment and settled principles of comity and federalism.  It notes that the court's September 23, 1994, order repeatedly states that DeKalb is due compensation for the State's violation of O.C.G.A. &#167; 20-2-188, a holding that is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  While conceding that the district court clarified its order by relying on the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI rather than the state statute as the basis for its award, the State argues that it is, in substance, one for the violation of state law.  It also insists that the district court's decision abridges the political integrity of the State by reallocating a tax burden between DeKalb County taxpayers and those who bear the tax burden in the state-at-large.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State also maintains that Title VI does not support the award of damages in this case.  While admitting that Congress has abrogated the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to actions brought pursuant to Title VI, the defendants assert that this case is far from a legitimate Title VI action.  It alleges that DeKalb County, as a subordinate creation of the state, lacks standing to bring this action against the State.  Moreover, noting that this case is simply one for allocating a tax burden, not for substantive relief under the civil rights laws, the State claims that the individual plaintiffs here also lack standing to seek relief against the State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution provides that \"[t]he Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.\"   Over a century ago, the Supreme Court made clear that this language also barred suits against a state by its own citizens.

For that reason, a federal court may not entertain a cause of action against a state for alleged violations of state law, even if that state claim is pendent to a federal claim which the district court could adjudicate.  Id. at 117-23, 104 S.Ct. at 917-20.   According to the Supreme Court, \"[a] federal court's grant of relief against state officials on the basis of state law, whether prospective or retroactive, does not vindicate the supreme authority of federal law.  On the contrary, it is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.  Such a result conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\"  Id. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, DeKalb invoked the jurisdiction of the district court by asserting that the State's conduct violated federal rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act.  As far as transportation funding is concerned, however, the gravamen of its complaint appears to be that the State has improperly interpreted and failed to adhere to a state statute governing reimbursement for transportation costs.  As was noted earlier, the district court's order concluded that DeKalb was due additional \"transportation monies that should have been paid pursuant to state law.\"   It is uncontroverted that the damages awarded to DeKalb in this case was measured by application of the disputed Georgia statutory provision, O.C.G.A. &#167; 20-2-188(d).  DeKalb's discussion of this issue in its brief before us is almost entirely devoted to state law.  Looking at the substance of the district court's judgment, it appears to be one for violation of state law, a holding barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  See Pennhurst, 465 U.S. at 106, 104 S.Ct. at 911.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Replying to the State's post-judgment motion, the district court modified its initial decision to rest its judgment more clearly on its finding that the State had violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI.  Even if we assume that the district court's disposition is based on federal law, the judgment in favor of DeKalb must still overcome the Eleventh Amendment barrier.  The Supreme Court has found no general abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity for claims brought pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Quern v.

The Supreme Court has recognized a private right of action for individuals injured by a Title VI violation.  See Cannon v. University of Chicago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110077\"><a href=\"/opinion/110077/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 696-97, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110077\"><a href=\"/opinion/110077/cannon-v-university-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The legitimate interests of those individuals are in an integrated educational system in DeKalb County which complies with the requirements of the Constitution, and their rights in those matters have been vindicated by the district court in the underlying desegregation action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a>  No discrete relief was sought in this action in favor of the individual plaintiffs, and none has been awarded for their benefit.  Indeed, given that the DCSS is funding all the desegregation measures required by the Constitution, these individuals have suffered no injury at all which could be remedied by the invocation of Title VI.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must be emphasized that we are not being called upon to adjudicate the rights of minority students and parents to a quality, unified educational system in DeKalb County.  As just noted, those rights have been vindicated in the desegregation lawsuit, and the district court has now declared the DCSS to be a unitary school system, a determination which is not on appeal.  The plaintiffs in this action sought only a monetary award to compensate DeKalb for some of its past desegregative transportation and other program costs and an injunction to require the State to help fund those initiatives in the future.  In other words, this case is simply about who will pay for the measures undertaken by DeKalb to remedy the effects of the past segregation of its public schools, the taxpayers of DeKalb County alone or the taxpayers of the state as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If DeKalb had sought this relief in the underlying desegregation suit, it would be more clearly revealed for what it is:  a third-party claim for contribution by a political subdivision of a state against the sovereign that created it.  Yet, a federal court's grant of relief in such an instance would be a serious violation of the most elementary notions of federalism and comity.  A state's power to create, abolish and determine the level of public funding of political subdivisions has long been recognized as an element of state sovereignty.  See, e.g., City of Trenton v. State of New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100208\"><a href=\"/opinion/100208/trenton-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 186, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100208\"><a href=\"/opinion/100208/trenton-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals observed in a similar case involving the funding of local school desegregation measures, \"[i]t would be an unfathomable intrusion into a state's affairs--and a violation of the most basic notions of federalism--for a federal court to determine the allocation of a state's financial resources.

It calls attention to the fact that it has been enjoined to adhere to a state funding statute as that statute has been interpreted by a federal court.  The result will not be any enhancement of the desegregation programs in DeKalb County, which are already being funded by DeKalb as the Constitution requires, but, rather, a reallocation of resources from poorer, rural school districts to a wealthier suburban district.  According to the State, this is beyond the power of the federal courts.

It takes the position that, since the early 1960's, when nearly every Georgia student attended his neighborhood school, or school for the attendance zone in which he resided, the statute has been construed consistently to provide transportation funding only for students residing more than one and one-half miles from their neighborhood school based on the distance between their homes and that school.  Finally, the State argues that DeKalb has failed to identify any nonmonetary injury which it has suffered as a result of the State's interpretation of the statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of the district court's grant of injunctive relief, DeKalb asserts that such a prospective remedy fits within the exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity recognized in Ex parte Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96819\"><a href=\"/opinion/96819/ex-parte-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The only action the defendants are required to take to comply with the district court's injunction is to pay from the state treasury the additional funds specified by the district court.  If the defendant state officials make those payments, they will not be in contempt of the court's order;  if they fail to do so, such failure will constitute contempt.  Therefore, as the Sixth Circuit found in Kelley, the injunctive relief is ancillary only to itself and does not fall within the Young exception.  Thus, this action is, in substance, one against the state, a proceeding barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as DeKalb points out, that some states have been ordered by federal courts to help fund local desegregation efforts.  They cite cases involving the desegregation of the Little Rock, Arkansas, Detroit, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri school districts, in which state governments were ordered to participate in desegregation remedies.  The district court found, however, that the state governments in each of those cases had far greater responsibility for primary and secondary education and much more authority over the local school districts.  In addition, the states or state agencies in those cases had participated in the desegregation litigation since its inception.  See, e.g., Little Rock School District v.

In Kelley, the Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville and Davidson County sued the State of Tennessee some 26 years after the filing of a desegregation suit involving Nashville and Davidson County seeking reimbursement for its past desegregation costs and injunctive relief to compel the State to fund future desegregation efforts.

In the view of that court, the case constituted \"the LISD's belated effort to recover costs which smacks of an attempted end-run around the Texas legislature's allocation of state funds.

There, the district court had permitted the local district to join the State as a defendant approximately 30 years after the original desegregation lawsuit was filed and had ordered the State to pay 15% of the costs of the relief granted in the case.  The appellate court reversed, concluding that the district court had wrongfully joined the State in the litigation where neither the original plaintiffs nor the United States as intervenor had sought to pursue a claim against the State.  Id. at 715-16.   The court held that a federal court lacked authority to entertain a contribution claim by a local school district against the State.

Thus, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has refused to approve additional equitable relief once a school district achieved unitary status.  According to that court,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p>accommodation of federal superintendence and federalism will not tolerate the idea that although the wrong is righted, the magnitude of the past wrong nonetheless justifies perpetuation of a federal order limiting the ambit of a school district's self-governance.  It is state government that we are asked to enjoin.  Surely, faithfulness to federalism counsels that having righted the wrong, the limits we will impose on the state can be drawn no more tightly than the limits of the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v.

Yet, the district court in the desegregation case concluded that DeKalb had achieved unitary status with respect to transportation in 1988, a holding not appealed by the plaintiffs, and that court recently found that the DCSS was unitary in all aspects of its operations.  Like the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, we do not believe that the prospective injunctive relief granted in this case can be reconciled with a finding that the DCSS has achieved unitary status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  In our view, a federal court lacks authority to compel compliance with such an indeterminate prospective order once the Constitutional violation has been remedied.  For these reasons, the district court's grant of injunctive relief to DeKalb requiring the State to fund DeKalb's future transportation costs must be reversed.B. Plaintiffs' Appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DeKalb appeals the district court's rejection of its request for reimbursement for some of its non-transportation desegregation costs.  In its opinion, the State's history of enforcing segregation renders it liable for at least some of DeKalb's costs in desegregating its schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As stated above, the district court found that DeKalb was primarily responsible for operating its public schools and, further, that the State had not impeded DeKalb's M to M or magnet school programs.  Therefore, as a factual matter, the State could not be held liable for DeKalb's costs in developing and implementing those desegregation programs.  Furthermore, for the reasons discussed earlier respecting DeKalb's transportation expenses, the State may not be required legally to contribute to those costs.  DeKalb has not cited any case where there was a similar division of responsibility for public education, and where liability for desegregation costs was sought to be imposed on state government years after the initiation of such efforts, which held the state financially responsible for local school desegregation efforts.  The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have rejected such claims for state contribution in similar circumstances, and we feel compelled to follow their course.

Even so, in order to have standing to sue in federal court, a plaintiff must allege an injury in fact distinct from that suffered by all or a large class of citizens.  See, e.g., Warth v.

Therefore, with respect to federal taxpayers, the Supreme Court has generally found they lack standing to contest government spending unless the challenge is to government expenditures which allegedly violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.  See Flast v. Cohen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107731\"><a href=\"/opinion/107731/flast-v-cohen/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
