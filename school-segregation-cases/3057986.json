Maldonado, a Georgia death-row inmate proceeding pro se, appeals\n\nthe district judge’s granting summary judgment to the Newton County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment defendants on his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint. We affirm in part,\n\nvacate in part, and remand.\n\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Facts\n\n      On August 31, 2012, Maldonado was convicted in Georgia state court of\n\nmalice murder, felony murder, armed robbery, concealing the death of another, and\n\nforgery; he was sentenced to death. Maldonado currently is confined at the\n\nGeorgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison, to which he was transferred on\n\nSeptember 7, 2012. From June 15, 2009, through September 7, 2012, Maldonado\n\nwas detained at the Newton County Detention Center (“NCDC”). This § 1983\n\naction relates to Maldonado’s pretrial confinement at the NCDC, during which\n\ntime he claims corrections officers retaliated against him, were deliberately\n\n\n                                          2\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 3 of 37\n\n\nindifferent to his serious medical needs, and committed various other wrongs\n\nagainst him.\n\n      1.       Retaliation Claims\n\n      In his complaint, Maldonado alleged Officer First Name Unknown (“FNU”)\n\nMyrie assaulted him various times between June and July 2010. Maldonado\n\nexplained at his deposition this allegation referred to an incident that occurred on\n\nJune 26, 2010, when Officer Myrie, at the direction of Officer Keith Brown, who\n\nwas in the control tower, assaulted him as he was coming out of visitation.\n\nSubsequently, Maldonado was taken to intake to be placed on suicide watch and\n\nallegedly was denied medical treatment by Lieutenant Selena Williams. In an\n\ninmate-grievance form dated June 29, 2010, Maldonado complained he had been\n\nremoved to suicide watch for no apparent reason after being assaulted by Officer\n\nMyrie and stated Officer Brown had confiscated his personal-hygiene items and\n\nlaw books.\n\n      Maldonado’s jail medical file showed he was seen by a nurse on June 26,\n\n2010, at the request of Lieutenant Williams. Maldonado complained his right\n\nshoulder had been dislocated, although he was able to pull his shirt over his head,\n\nmove both arms easily, and unsnap his uniform. Maldonado also stated an officer\n\nhad choked him, but no swelling or discoloration was noted around his throat. He\n\nhad reddened areas on both shoulders and his head, and medical personnel directed\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 4 of 37\n\n\nofficers to give him ice for his injuries. Maldonado was examined again on June\n\n29 and 30, 2010, after complaining of pain in his right shoulder, which was bruised\n\nand slightly swollen. Medical staff provided Maldonado over-the-counter\n\nmedication for his pain and recommended an ice pack.\n\n      On July 12, 2010, Maldonado argued with Officer Novel Ellis after she\n\naccused him of taking another inmate’s laundry bag. Sergeant Clarence White and\n\nanother officer, who is not a defendant in this action, escorted Maldonado first to\n\ndisciplinary segregation and then to a cell in the medical unit. While he was in the\n\nmedical unit, Maldonado states Sergeant White came into his cell, threw him to the\n\nground, and said something like “you won’t put my name in a lawsuit”; Sergeant\n\nWhite then tased Maldonado on the left side of his face. R. at 1124.\n\n      Maldonado was examined by prison medical staff following this incident,\n\nand complained to the nurse that he had been tased in the face. The nurse noted\n\nredness on the left side of Maldonado’s face but concluded it did not require any\n\ntreatment. Maldonado did not file an inmate-grievance form concerning this\n\nincident.\n\n      On July 29, 2010, Maldonado posted a note on his cell door asking to be left\n\nalone; it stated he had enough commissary items to last him for several weeks.\n\nLieutenant Williams and Corporal George Jefferson went into Maldonado’s cell;\n\nJefferson restrained Maldonado while Williams removed his personal items.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 5 of 37\n\n\nWilliams reportedly said something like “let’s see how you are going to survive\n\nwithout your commissary.” R. at 142, 1130. In an undated letter addressed to\n\nLieutenant FNU Goodman, who is not a defendant in this action, Maldonado listed\n\na number of items that allegedly were taken from his cell, when he was removed\n\nfrom Seg-1, his regular housing unit, on July 12, 2010. On July 29, 2010,\n\nMaldonado filed an inmate request form and asked to speak to Lieutenant\n\nGoodman about officers taking his personal items in retaliation for grievances he\n\nhad filed. He again requested the replacement of his personal items in an inmate-\n\nrequest form dated September 13, 2010. At the bottom of that form, Lieutenant\n\nGoodman noted the items were replaced on September 14, 2010. In a\n\nmemorandum dated September 14, 2010, and addressed to Maldonado, Lieutenant\n\nGoodman listed the items Maldonado had received, and Maldonado signed at the\n\nbottom, acknowledging receipt of those items.\n\n      On August 9, 2010, Sergeant White, on the orders of Captain Sammy Banks,\n\nattempted to place Maldonado in disciplinary segregation, allegedly for no\n\napparent reason. Maldonado refused to go to disciplinary segregation; instead, he\n\nwas placed on suicide watch against his will. Because Maldonado did not\n\nvoluntarily remove his clothing, Sergeant White and Corporal Jefferson undressed\n\nhim and put him in a suicide suit. Maldonado was “manhandled” by the officers\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 6 of 37\n\n\nduring this process, but he did not suffer any physical injuries. R. at 1152. He did\n\nnot file a grievance concerning this incident.\n\n      On September 2, 2010, Captain Banks and Officer Brice Smith ordered\n\nMaldonado to be placed in disciplinary segregation with a convicted murderer,\n\narmed robber, and drug trafficker, allegedly for discriminatory and retaliatory\n\nreasons. Maldonado did not file a grievance concerning this incident.\n\n      On September 20, 2010, Sergeant Freeman Moody ordered Maldonado to\n\nget out of the shower. Maldonado did not comply immediately and told Moody he\n\nneeded to finish rinsing off. Moody allegedly then dragged Maldonado out of the\n\nshower and pushed him into his cell, causing Maldonado to slip and hurt his back.\n\nMaldonado began swearing at Moody and spit on the window of his cell door.\n\nMoody told Maldonado he was going to file disciplinary charges against him.\n\nMaldonado did not file a grievance concerning this incident.\n\n      On December 23, 2010, after being threatened by another inmate,\n\nMaldonado jammed the door to his cell. Jail staff removed the door, and Officers\n\nJoe Maher and Wesley Ramsey removed Maldonado from his cell. Officers Maher\n\nand Ramsey told Maldonado they were taking him to suicide watch, but\n\nMaldonado insisted he was not suicidal and refused to put on a suicide suit.\n\nOfficers Maher and Ramsey then placed Maldonado in a restraint chair with both\n\nhis hands and feet restrained. According to Maldonado, once he was in the\n\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 7 of 37\n\n\nrestraint chair, Officers Maher and Ramsey told him to “drop [their] name from\n\nany lawsuit” he had filed and threatened he would “regret bringing their name in\n\nany type of lawsuit”; they then broke his left pinky finger, kicked him, and burned\n\nhim with a lighter. R. at 1179-80. On December 27, 2010, Maldonado filed an\n\ninmate-grievance form and complained he was taken to intake on December 23,\n\n2010, to be placed on suicide watch, even though he was not suicidal; thereafter\n\nOfficers Maher and Ramsey placed him in the restraint chair, beat him, tortured\n\nhim, and burned him with a lighter.\n\n      At approximately 1 a.m. on December 24, 2010, after Maldonado had been\n\nplaced in the restraint chair, a nurse was called to examine him. Maldonado told\n\nthe nurse officers had hit him in the head, kicked him in the ribs, and broken his\n\nfinger. The nurse noted Maldonado was able to move his fingers without any\n\nproblem, but could not flex his left index finger, which was swollen. The nurse\n\nchecked on Maldonado again at 2:30 a.m. and noted his left index finger was\n\nslightly discolored. The following day, Maldonado complained his left wrist was\n\nbroken, but the nurse noted no swelling or discoloration. On December 27, 2010,\n\nan x-ray was taken of Maldonado’s left wrist, which revealed no abnormality or\n\nfracture.\n\n      On May 26, 2011, Maldonado came out of his cell and asked to speak to a\n\nsupervisor or internal-affairs investigator to make a complaint about an officer who\n\n\n                                          7\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016      Page: 8 of 37\n\n\nwas harassing him sexually. Officers told Maldonado to lock down in his cell, but\n\nMaldonado refused to do so until he had spoken to a supervisor. Corporal Maurice\n\nKennard escorted Maldonado back into his cell. Maldonado was not combative,\n\nbut once inside the cell, “a few words [were] said,” and Corporal Kennard pepper-\n\nsprayed Maldonado in the face. R. at 1201. After the incident, Sergeant White\n\nallegedly went into Maldonado’s cell and threatened him to stop pursuing lawsuits\n\nor internal investigations against the officers. A nurse examined Maldonado in his\n\ncell after he was pepper-sprayed; Maldonado then showered to wash off the pepper\n\nspray. The following day, May 27, 2011, Maldonado filed a grievance asserting\n\nthe pepper-spray incident was in retaliation for his attempt to make a sexual\n\nharassment complaint. 1\n\n       On August 8, 2011, Corporal Kennard and Officer Brown allegedly attacked\n\nMaldonado in his cell after Maldonado accidentally broke a TV remote control,\n\nwhen he tossed it. According to Maldonado, the officers punched him, slammed\n\nhim on the floor, and broke his tooth. Following this incident, medical personnel\n\nwere called to examine Maldonado. The nurse noted Maldonado’s forehead and\n\nright ear were red, and he had an abrasion on his left elbow, but he did not have\n\nany severe injuries. From August 9 through 16, 2011, medical staff checked on\n       1\n         In his complaint, Maldonado alleged Sergeant Octavis Campbell had harassed him\nsexually and would retaliate against him if he refused to comply with her demands. He also\nalleged Campbell had denied him access to the prison mail system. At summary judgment, with\nMaldonado’s consent, the district judge dismissed Campbell as a defendant for lack of service;\nMaldonado does not challenge that decision on appeal.\n                                              8\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 9 of 37\n\n\nMaldonado daily. They also checked on him on August 19 and 22, 2011, and daily\n\non August 24 through 30, 2011. Maldonado did not complain to medical staff\n\nduring those visits. On August 10, 2011, Maldonado filed an inmate request form\n\nand complained he had been punished and beaten for “a remote control that came\n\napart & for not cleaning up.” R. at 1435.\n\n      Finally, according to Maldonado, on August 12, 2011, Lieutenant Williams\n\nand Sergeant Smith trashed his cell and disposed of $100 worth of commissary\n\nitems and half of his discovery from his criminal case. Between August 8 and 14,\n\n2011, Maldonado filed several requests seeking the return of his discovery material\n\nand commissary items. The response on the form dated August 14, 2011, shows\n\nMaldonado’s property had been returned.\n\n      2.    Deliberate Indifference Claims\n\n      In his complaint, Maldonado generally alleged he had been denied medical\n\nattention for his serious health issues between June and October of 2011. At his\n\ndeposition, Maldonado testified his deliberate-indifference claim was based on the\n\nJune 26, 2010, July 12, 2010, December 23, 2010, and May 26, 2011, incidents\n\npreviously described. Maldonado did not file any grievances concerning any\n\ndeprivation or delay of medical treatment.\n\n      3.    Other Claims\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 10 of 37\n\n\n      Maldonado also alleged officers failed to protect him from being attacked by\n\nhis former cellmate, Joseph White, on July 3 and 10, 2010. Maldonado represents\n\nWhite had assaulted him both physically and sexually on several prior occasions.\n\nMaldonado had reported those incidents to corrections officers and requested his\n\nvisitation schedule be changed, so it would not overlap that of White, but officers\n\nfailed to take any action. On July 3, 2010, while Maldonado was waiting for\n\nvisitation, White attacked him. Maldonado reported the assault to Officer Ellis,\n\nwho simply told the two men they needed to work out their problems. On July 10,\n\n2010, Maldonado’s visitation schedule had not been changed, and White again\n\nassaulted Maldonado.\n\n      In addition, Maldonado generally alleged Lieutenant Williams, Sergeant\n\nSmith, and Captain Banks had denied him access to the law library, clergy visits,\n\nand religious materials. In particular, on August 17, 2010, Captain Banks denied\n\nMaldonado access to the law library and clergy visits, while he was being held in a\n\nvideo-monitored intake cell after being released from suicide watch. Maldonado\n\nalso claimed Sergeant Smith had denied him a refund for store goods that had been\n\nlost by jail custodians on May 31, 2011, and alleged a jail-staff member, Mrs.\n\nOliver, who is not a defendant in this action, had tampered with his mail.\n\nB.    District Court Proceedings\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 11 of 37\n\n\n      Maldonado initiated this action in June 2011 by filing in the district court a\n\nletter, challenging the conditions of his pretrial confinement in the NCDC. His\n\npreviously filed complaint, raising similar issues regarding his confinement at the\n\nNCDC, had been dismissed for failure to state a claim on June 17, 2010. The\n\ndistrict judge had directed Maldonado to file an amended complaint limited to any\n\nalleged violations of his rights that had occurred after dismissal of his prior suit.\n\nMaldonado complied and filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”), which is the\n\noperative complaint in this case. Maldonado also moved for appointment of\n\ncounsel and asserted he could not afford an attorney and was unable to represent\n\nhimself effectively.\n\n      In his SAC, Maldonado named as defendants Newton County, the Newton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Ezell Brown, and numerous individual corrections\n\nofficers. He alleged nine counts: (1) violation of his First, Fourth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights against Newton County (Count I); (2) violation of\n\nhis First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights against the individual\n\ndefendants (Count II); (3) assault and battery against Officers Joe Maher, Wesley\n\nRamsey, Keith Brown, and inmate Joseph White (Count III); (4) intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, apparently against all of the individual defendants\n\n(Count IV); (5) negligent retention against Newton County (Count V); (6) violation\n\nof his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241 against Newton County (Count VI);\n\n\n                                           11\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 12 of 37\n\n\n(7) violation of his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241 against the individual\n\ndefendants (Count VII); (8) violation of his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 242\n\nagainst Newton County (Count VIII); and (9) violation of his civil rights under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 242 against the individual defendants (Count IX).\n\n       The district judge screened Maldonado’s complaint under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915A. On September 27, 2012, the judge issued an order dismissing all of\n\nMaldonado’s claims except his § 1983 deliberate indifference and retaliation\n\nclaims against the individual officers and his state-law claims against inmate\n\nJoseph White.2 The judge also denied Maldonado’s motion for appointment of\n\ncounsel, subject to reconsideration at a later time, because the facts were not\n\nsufficiently substantiated at that time to warrant appointment of counsel.3 On\n\nJanuary 8, 2013, Maldonado filed an untimely motion for reconsideration of the\n\nscreening order and sought reinstatement of Counts II (§ 1983 claim against the\n\nindividual officers), III (assault and battery), and IV (intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress). The judge denied Maldonado’s motion, because it did not\n\nwarrant reconsideration of the screening order and was untimely.\n\n\n       2\n           Consequently, the district judge dismissed at the screening stage Maldonado’s claims\nthat jail staff had (1) failed to protect him from being attacked by inmate Joseph White on July 3\nand 10, 2010, (2) denied him access to the law library and clergy visits on August 17, 2010,\n(3) denied him a refund for personal goods lost on May 31, 2011, and (4) tampered with his mail.\nMaldonado does not argue on appeal the judge erred in dismissing these claims.\n       3\n        Maldonado made several subsequent requests for the appointment of counsel, all of\nwhich the judge denied.\n                                               12\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 13 of 37\n\n\n      As discovery proceeded, Maldonado moved for appointment of a medical\n\ndoctor and a psychiatrist to provide expert opinions concerning the physical and\n\nmental injuries he had suffered from the defendants’ abuses. A magistrate judge\n\ndenied Maldonado’s motion and concluded Maldonado had not substantiated\n\nsufficiently the need for appointment of an expert to ensure a just resolution of his\n\ncase. Maldonado later filed a motion to compel discovery and asserted the\n\ndefendants failed to respond to numerous requests for production of documents and\n\nwere delaying intentionally disclosure of other requested documents. While his\n\nmotion to compel was pending, Maldonado filed a motion for inspection of\n\ntangible items and entry upon land and requested permission to enter the NCDC to\n\ninspect the premises and to take measurements, photographs, and video. He\n\nrepresented this evidence was necessary to refute various assertions made by the\n\nindividual defendants in their responses to interrogatories.\n\n      Subsequently, defendants moved for summary judgment. In relevant part,\n\nthey argued Maldonado had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as\n\nrequired by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a),\n\nbecause he did not file any grievances naming any of the individual defendants\n\nconcerning the issues raised in this case. The defendants further contended no\n\nevidence supported Maldonado’s claims of retaliation, and Maldonado would have\n\nbeen disciplined regardless of his protected conduct. Concerning Maldonado’s\n\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 14 of 37\n\n\nclaim of deliberate indifference regarding his medical needs, the defendants argued\n\nthe evidence showed Maldonado had received adequate medical care during his\n\nincarceration at the NCDC. Finally, they asserted they were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity concerning both of Maldonado’s claims.\n\n      Before responding to the motion for summary judgment, Maldonado\n\nrenewed his request for appointment of a medical expert and contended he also\n\nneeded an expert witness to refute the defendants’ taser expert. In his response to\n\nthe motion for summary judgment, Maldonado maintained he did exhaust his\n\navailable administrative remedies. He asserted he filed grievances concerning\n\nsome of the issues raised in this lawsuit, but the defendants had prevented him\n\nfrom filing grievances concerning other instances of mistreatment. Under these\n\ncircumstances, Maldonado contended he should not be penalized for failing to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies, because his failure was caused by the\n\ndefendants’ misconduct.\n\n      Concerning his retaliation claims, Maldonado insisted there was a causal\n\nconnection between the defendants’ abuses and his many grievances and legal\n\ncomplaints. He also contested the defendants’ assertion he would have been\n\ndisciplined despite his protected conduct. Maldonado further argued the\n\ndefendants were not entitled to summary judgment on his deliberate-indifference\n\nclaims, because he presented evidence showing the defendants denied or delayed\n\n\n                                         14\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 15 of 37\n\n\nmedical treatment. Finally, he contended the defendants were not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity, because he had shown they violated his clearly established\n\nconstitutional rights.\n\n      In support of his response, Maldonado filed a number of documents,\n\nincluding a copy of the NCDC Inmate Handbook, dated January 2009. The\n\nHandbook provided an inmate who wishes to file a grievance must:\n\n      a.            Request a grievance form from the security officer.\n\n      b.            Write on the grievance form the date and time of the\n                    occurrence, and the name of the facility, staff, and\n                    inmates involved, and a detailed description of the\n                    incident.\n\n      c.            A grievance must be submitted within five days of the\n                    incident or discovery of the matter being grieved. . . .\n\nR. at 1566.\n\n      A magistrate judge issued a final Report and Recommendation (“R&R”),\n\nwhich addressed Maldonado’s pending motions as well as the defendants’ motion\n\nfor summary judgment. As a preliminary matter, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended Sergeant Octavis Campbell, Officer FNU Myrie, and inmate Joseph\n\nWhite be dismissed for lack of service. The magistrate judge then denied\n\nMaldonado’s motion for entry upon land, because he had not demonstrated the\n\nnecessary discovery could not be accomplished through other means, and his\n\nrequest was not justified in view of the limitations imposed on him by his\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 16 of 37\n\n\nincarceration for his capital sentence. Similarly, the magistrate judge denied\n\nMaldonado’s motion to compel discovery and found the material Maldonado\n\nsought was cumulative, irrelevant, or exceeded the scope of discovery. For the\n\nsame reasons, the magistrate judge also denied Maldonado’s motion for\n\nappointment of an expert witness.\n\n      Regarding the motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge first\n\nidentified the following incidents of misconduct, alleged in the SAC and permitted\n\nto proceed in the screening order, as the basis for Maldonado’s § 1983 retaliation\n\nclaim: (1) the July 12, 2010, taser incident, (2) the July 29, 2010, confiscation of\n\nproperty, (3) the August 9, 2010, move to suicide watch, (4) the September 2,\n\n2010, move to disciplinary segregation, (5) the December 23, 2010, assault by\n\nOfficers Maher and Ramsey, (6) the May 26, 2011, pepper-spray incident, (7) the\n\nAugust 8, 2011, attack by Corporal Kennard and Officer Brown, and (8) the\n\nAugust 12, 2011, destruction of his property. Concerning Maldonado’s deliberate-\n\nindifference claim, the magistrate judge noted the SAC generally alleged deliberate\n\nindifference to his medical needs between June and October 2011 but did not\n\nidentify any specific instances that post-dated the dismissal of his prior suit.\n\n      In accordance with our precedent, the magistrate judge construed the motion\n\nfor summary judgment as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) motion to\n\ndismiss in addressing the PLRA exhaustion requirement. The magistrate judge\n\n\n                                          16\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 17 of 37\n\n\nconcluded Maldonado had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies concerning\n\nhis deliberate-indifference claims and his retaliation claims regarding the incidents\n\non July 12, 2010, August 9, 2010, September 2, 2010, May 26, 2011, August 8,\n\n2011, and August 12, 2011, because he had failed to submit copies of any\n\nadministrative grievances concerning those claims. The magistrate judge also\n\ndetermined Maldonado did not properly exhaust his claim concerning the\n\nDecember 23, 2010, incident, because his administrative grievance did not state a\n\nretaliation claim. Finally, the magistrate judge found Maldonado properly had\n\ngrieved the July 29, 2010, incident as a retaliation claim but concluded this claim\n\nshould be dismissed, because the grievance fully was resolved administratively.\n\nConsequently, the magistrate judge concluded the defendants were entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on all of Maldonado’s claims.\n\n       Maldonado objected to the R&R and contended the magistrate judge had\n\nerred in denying his motions to compel and for entry upon land. Regarding the\n\nmotion for summary judgment, Maldonado contended the magistrate judge had\n\nfailed to address his claim he was assaulted by Officer Myrie on June 26, 2010, but\n\ndid not otherwise object to the magistrate judge’s recitation of the retaliation\n\nclaims remaining on summary judgment. 4 Maldonado argued the magistrate judge\n\n\n\n       4\n         Aside from the June 26, 2010, claim, Maldonado cannot challenge on appeal the district\njudge’s failure to address other retaliation claims he may have raised that were not discussed in\n                                               17\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016      Page: 18 of 37\n\n\nalso erred in concluding he had not exhausted his claim concerning the May 26,\n\n2011, incident and directed the judge’s attention to the May 27, 2011, grievance he\n\nhad filed. Maldonado further asserted his failure to exhaust his other retaliation\n\nand deliberate-indifference claims was not his fault, because defendants had\n\nprevented him from filing grievances, destroyed his grievances, or failed to\n\ninvestigate them properly. Finally, Maldonado stated he had no objection to the\n\ndismissal of Sergeant Campbell, Officer Myrie, and inmate Joseph White for lack\n\nof service.\n\n       The district judge adopted the R&R with some modifications and overruled\n\nMaldonado’s objections. Because Maldonado did not object to the dismissal of\n\nSergeant Campbell, Officer Myrie, and Joseph White, the district judge adopted\n\nthe magistrate judge’s recommendation those defendants, and Maldonado’s claims\n\nagainst them, be dismissed. The judge concluded the magistrate judge did not\n\nclearly err in denying Maldonado’s discovery motions and noted Maldonado’s\n\nobjections showed he had sought to use discovery to collect evidence of a pattern\n\nof constitutional violations against other prisoners to bolster his own claims, which\n\nwas inappropriate in this case. The judge further noted Maldonado did not object\n\n\n\n\nthe R&R, because he did not object to the omission of these claims in his objections to the R&R.\nSee 11th Cir. R. 3-1.\n                                               18\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 19 of 37\n\n\nspecifically to the portion of the magistrate judge’s order setting out Maldonado’s\n\nretaliation claims and adopted that portion of the R&R. 5\n\n       Concerning the exhaustion issue, the district judge agreed the summary\n\njudgment motion should be treated as a Rule 12(b) motion. The judge adopted the\n\nmagistrate judge’s conclusion that Maldonado had failed to exhaust his deliberate-\n\nindifference claims, because he never properly filed any written grievances raising\n\nthose claims. Similarly, the judge adopted the R&R conclusions that (1) for the\n\nincidents on July 12, 2010, August 9, 2010, September 2, 2010, December 23,\n\n2010, August 8, 2011, and August 12, 2011, Maldonado either did not file\n\ngrievances or did not assert retaliation claims in his grievances, and\n\n(2) Maldonado’s grievance concerning the July 29, 2010, incident was resolved\n\nfully. Regarding the May 26, 2011, incident, however, the district judge concluded\n\nMaldonado had exhausted his administrative remedies. Although not included in\n\nhis summary judgment filings, Maldonado had attached a grievance form\n\n       5\n         Maldonado did raise a specific objection concerning the magistrate judge’s failure to\naddress the June 26, 2010, attack by Officer Myrie. The judge properly dismissed that claim as to\nOfficer Myrie for lack of service. The judge failed to address, however, Maldonado’s claims\nOfficer Brown directed Officer Myrie to assault him, and Lieutenant Williams thereafter denied\nhim medical treatment. Nevertheless, we may affirm the district judge’s judgment on any\nground, Thomas v. Cooper Lighting, Inc., 506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir. 2007), and the record\nshows Maldonado did not properly exhaust his claims against Lieutenant Williams and Officer\nBrown concerning this incident. Maldonado’s grievance did not mention Lieutenant Williams or\nallege any denial of medical treatment; the record shows Maldonado received medical attention\non June 26, 2010, at Lieutenant Williams’s request. In addition, Maldonado’s grievance\nmentioned Officer Brown only in connection with the confiscation of his property, which did not\nform a part of his claim in the district court and about which he does not complain on appeal.\nMaldonado also did not allege Officer Brown was involved in or responsible for the assault by\nOfficer Myrie. Accordingly, these claims properly were dismissed.\n                                               19\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 20 of 37\n\n\nconcerning the May 26, 2011, incident to an earlier filing; that grievance form\n\nspecifically accused Corporal Kennard and Sergeant White of retaliating against\n\nhim.\n\n       Nevertheless, the judge concluded dismissal of all of Maldonado’s § 1983\n\nclaims was warranted on qualified immunity. The judge stated it was “undisputed\n\nthat the Individual Officers were acting within the scope of their discretionary\n\nauthority at the time of the alleged violations.” R. at 2009-10. Consequently,\n\nMaldonado bore the burden of showing the officers had violated his clearly\n\nestablished constitutional rights. The district judge stated Maldonado had made no\n\neffort to satisfy that burden in either his response to the motion for summary\n\njudgment or his objections to the R&R and concluded Maldonado could not have\n\nshown his rights were clearly established. Concerning the May 26, 2011, incident,\n\nthe judge explained Maldonado’s deposition testimony showed he had failed to\n\ncomply with officers’ orders. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient for the\n\njudge to conclude Corporal Kennard had pepper-sprayed Maldonado for punitive\n\npurposes rather than to induce compliance with a lawful order. Furthermore,\n\nMaldonado did not respond to the qualified-immunity defense at all, much less\n\nprovide the judge with any “controlling and materially similar case” demonstrating\n\nthe use of pepper spray to obtain compliance with a lawful order was\n\nunconstitutional. Consequently, the judge concluded the individual defendants\n\n\n                                         20\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 21 of 37\n\n\nwere entitled to summary judgment regarding the May 26, 2011, incident based on\n\nqualified immunity. The judge further noted qualified immunity would bar all of\n\nMaldonado’s § 1983 claims, because of his failure to respond to that defense.\n\nTherefore, the judge adopted the R&R and granted the individual defendants’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. 6\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n       On appeal, Maldonado argues the district judge erroneously construed the\n\nexhaustion portion of the motion for summary judgment as a Rule 12(b) motion.\n\nHe also contends the defendants waived their failure-to-exhaust defense by their\n\naffirmative misconduct, asserts the defendants failed to prove that defense, and\n\nargues he demonstrated a genuine issue of fact concerning the availability of\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n       We review de novo a district judge’s application of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a),\n\nthe PLRA exhaustion requirement. Higginbottom v. Carter, 223 F.3d 1259, 1260\n\n(11th Cir. 2000). We treat an exhaustion defense raised in a motion for summary\n\njudgment as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion to dismiss. Bryant v. Rich, 530\n\nF.3d 1368, 1374-75 (11th Cir. 2008). In this context, the judge may consider facts\n       6\n         The judge failed to address Maldonado’s claim Officer Moody retaliated against him,\non September 20, 2010, by dragging him out of the shower and then pushing him, causing a back\ninjury. Nevertheless, we may affirm a district judge’s judgment on any ground, see Thomas, 506\nF.3d at 1364, and it is clear from the record Maldonado did not file any grievances regarding this\nincident. Because he failed to exhaust the September 20, 2010, claim, it properly was dismissed.\n                                               21\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 22 of 37\n\n\noutside of the pleadings and resolve factual disputes, as long as those factual\n\ndisputes do not decide the merits, and the parties have had a sufficient opportunity\n\nto develop the record. Id. at 1376. We review a district judge’s factual findings\n\nconcerning the exhaustion requirement for clear error. Id. at 1377.\n\n      Under § 1997e(a), prisoners may not bring a § 1983 action “until such\n\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n\nThe defendant bears the burden of showing the plaintiff failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies. Turner v. Burnside, 541 F.3d 1077, 1082 (11th Cir.\n\n2008). The PLRA exhaustion requirement serves to allow prison officials to\n\nresolve complaints internally before being subject to suit, reduce litigation to the\n\nextent complaints are satisfactorily resolved, and improve the litigation that does\n\noccur by creating an administrative record. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 219, 127\n\nS. Ct. 910, 923 (2007). To satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a prisoner must\n\ncomplete the administrative process in accordance with the applicable grievance\n\nprocedures set by the prison. Id. at 218, 127 S. Ct. at 922-23. The prison’s\n\nrequirements, rather than the PLRA, dictate the level of detail necessary for proper\n\nexhaustion. Id.\n\n      For an administrative remedy to be “available” under the PLRA, it must be\n\n“capable of use for the accomplishment of its purpose.” Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084\n\n(citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted). Consequently,\n\n\n                                          22\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 23 of 37\n\n\nretaliation or threats of retaliation may make administrative remedies unavailable\n\nto an inmate. Id. at 1084-85. Specifically, “a prison official’s serious threats of\n\nsubstantial retaliation against an inmate for lodging or pursuing in good faith a\n\ngrievance” render the administrative remedy unavailable if (1) the threat actually\n\ndeterred the plaintiff from filing a grievance or pursuing some aspect of the\n\nadministrative process, and (2) the threat is one that would deter a reasonable\n\ninmate of ordinary firmness. Id. at 1085. We also have noted, without deciding\n\nfor this circuit, that other courts have held administrative remedies are also\n\nunavailable, when prison officials prevent the filing of grievances or fail to respond\n\nto grievances that are filed. Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1373 n.6.\n\n      The district judge correctly applied our precedent in treating the exhaustion\n\ndefense as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion, and Maldonado had ample\n\nopportunity to develop the record concerning that issue. Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374-\n\n76. Regarding the merits of the exhaustion issue, the judge did not err in\n\nconcluding Maldonado failed to exhaust his administrative remedies concerning\n\nhis claim the individual officers were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical\n\nneeds, because a review of the record does not reveal any grievances filed by\n\nMaldonado concerning any deprivation or delay of medical treatment. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a); Jones, 549 U.S. at 218, 127 S. Ct. at 922-23. Furthermore, the record\n\nshows Maldonado promptly received medical treatment following each of the four\n\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 24 of 37\n\n\nincidents he identified in his deposition as supporting his deliberate- indifference\n\nclaim. Regarding his retaliation claims, the record contains no grievances\n\nconcerning the July 12, 2010, August 9, 2010, or September 2, 2010 incidents.\n\n      Maldonado argues any failure to exhaust on his part should be excused,\n\nbecause it was caused by defendants’ retaliatory conduct. He has not\n\ndemonstrated, however, he actually was deterred from filing grievances concerning\n\nthe three incidents about which he complains. See Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85.\n\nMaldonado did not identify any threats made by officers in connection with the\n\nAugust 9, 2010, incident, in which he allegedly was placed on suicide watch\n\nwithout cause. He further did not assert the defendants prevented him from filing a\n\ngrievance concerning the August 9, 2010, incident and acknowledged he did not\n\nsuffer any injuries from that incident other than being “manhandled.” R. at 1153.\n\nSimilarly, Maldonado did not assert the defendants made any threats or otherwise\n\nprevented him from filing a grievance concerning the September 2, 2010, incident,\n\nin which he allegedly was moved to Seg-2 for no reason. Therefore, Maldonado\n\ndid not show the defendants prevented him, via threats or otherwise, from filing a\n\ngrievance concerning the August 9, 2010, or September 2, 2010, incidents. See\n\nTurner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85.\n\n      Concerning the July 12, 2010, incident, Maldonado did assert that just\n\nbefore Officer White tased him in the face, White said something like “you won’t\n\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 25 of 37\n\n\nput my name in a lawsuit.” R. at 1124. Although this conduct could constitute the\n\nsort of serious threat that would deter an ordinary prisoner from filing a grievance,\n\nMaldonado never asserted he was actually deterred by White’s threat from filing a\n\ngrievance concerning that incident. See Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85. Moreover,\n\nthe record contains dozens of grievance forms filed by Maldonado throughout the\n\ncourse of his confinement at the NCDC, including complaints related to other\n\nincidents in which Maldonado alleged officers used physical force against him and\n\nthreatened him not to pursue legal action. Even if Maldonado’s allegations\n\nconcerning the defendants’ retaliatory conduct are true, he was not actually\n\ndeterred from filing grievances or pursuing legal action because of their conduct.\n\nSee Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85.\n\n      The record also contains no grievance referring to the August 12, 2011,\n\nincident, in which officers allegedly trashed Maldonado’s cell and disposed of his\n\npersonal property. There are, however, several grievance forms dated August 8, 9,\n\n11, and 14, 2011, in which Maldonado requested the return of property taken from\n\nhim on August 8 and 9, 2011. Given the nature of these grievances and their\n\ntemporal proximity to the August 12, 2011, date, it is possible Maldonado was\n\nmistaken about the date on which his property was taken. Nevertheless, this claim\n\nappears to have been resolved administratively, because the response on the\n\nAugust 14, 2011, grievance form shows Maldonado’s property was returned to\n\n\n                                         25\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 26 of 37\n\n\nhim. Consequently, the district judge properly dismissed the August 12, 2011,\n\nclaim, either because it was unexhausted or because it was resolved internally. See\n\nJones, 549 U.S. at 219, 127 S. Ct. at 923 (noting one of the purposes of the PLRA\n\nexhaustion requirement is to reduce litigation to the extent complaints are\n\nsatisfactorily resolved at the administrative level).\n\n      The judge also did not err in dismissing Maldonado’s claim concerning the\n\nJuly 29, 2010, incident, involving the confiscation of his personal items, because\n\nthat claim was fully resolved administratively. Maldonado filed several grievances\n\nconcerning the confiscation of his property and explicitly stated he believed the\n\nofficers acted in retaliation for his previous grievances. The record shows,\n\nhowever, all of Maldonado’s items were returned or replaced, and Maldonado\n\nsigned acknowledgments so stating. Therefore, Maldonado’s claim, though\n\nexhausted, properly was dismissed. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 219, 127 S. Ct. at 923.\n\n      In contrast, the judge erred in concluding Maldonado failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies for the December 23, 2010, and August 8, 2011, incidents,\n\nbased on the judge’s finding that his grievances concerning those incidents did not\n\nstate retaliation claims. We have not addressed whether, to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies for purposes of the PLRA, an inmate’s administrative grievance must\n\nhave alleged the specific legal theory he later pursues in a § 1983 action. The\n\nexhaustion requirement, allowing prison officials to address complaints in the first\n\n\n                                           26\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 27 of 37\n\n\ninstance, is satisfied as long as the inmate’s grievance provides sufficient detail to\n\nallow prison officials to investigate the alleged incident. See Jones, 549 U.S. at\n\n219, 127 S. Ct. at 923. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has held an inmate need\n\ncomply only with the prison grievance procedures to satisfy the exhaustion\n\nrequirement and has rejected attempts by courts to read additional procedural\n\nrequirements into the PLRA. See id. at 202, 218, 127 S. Ct. at 914, 922-23.\n\nConsequently, the judge erred in concluding Maldonado’s grievances were\n\ninadequate for purposes of exhaustion, because they did not allege a retaliatory\n\nmotive.\n\n      Nevertheless, regarding the August 8, 2011, incident, the judge ultimately\n\nwas correct in concluding Maldonado did not properly exhaust his claim. The\n\nNCDC procedures required a grievance contain a detailed description of the\n\nincident, including the date and time of the occurrence, and the officers or inmates\n\ninvolved. Maldonado’s grievance concerning the August 8, 2011, incident did not\n\nidentify the date or time of the incident or the officers involved; it merely stated\n\nMaldonado “got beat & punish [sic] for a remote control that came apart & for not\n\ncleaning up.” R. at 1435. In addition, Maldonado wrote his complaint on an\n\ninmate-request form, instead of an inmate-grievance form, as the NCDC Inmate\n\nHandbook instructs. Accordingly, Maldonado’s grievance concerning the August\n\n8, 2011, incident did not comply with the NCDC grievance procedure, and the\n\n\n                                          27\n\f                Case: 15-10867   Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 28 of 37\n\n\njudge correctly dismissed that claim as unexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 218,\n\n127 S. Ct. at 922-23.\n\n      In contrast, Maldonado’s grievance concerning the December 23, 2010,\n\nincident largely complies with the NCDC procedural requirements. That grievance\n\nis written on an inmate-grievance form, identifies the date of the alleged incident,\n\nidentifies the officers involved, and provides a detailed account of the incident,\n\ngiven the space limitations on the form. Consequently, Maldonado properly\n\nexhausted his administrative remedies concerning the December 23, 2010,\n\nincident, and the judge erred in dismissing that claim for failure to exhaust. See\n\nJones, 549 U.S. at 218, 127 S. Ct. at 922-23.\n\nB.    Qualified Immunity\n\n      Maldonado also contends the judge erroneously placed the burden of\n\ndisproving the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity on him, when it was\n\nthe defendants’ burden to prove they were entitled to qualified immunity. He\n\nfurther asserts the judge erroneously applied a heightened standard of proof\n\nconcerning the clearly established law prong of the qualified-immunity defense.\n\nFinally, he argues the defendants waived their qualified-immunity defense, because\n\nthey did not plead or prove it properly; in any event, Maldonado presented\n\nevidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact regarding the availability of\n\nthat defense.\n\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 29 of 37\n\n\n      We review de novo a district judge’s disposition of a motion for summary\n\njudgment based on qualified immunity, resolve all issues of material fact in favor\n\nof the plaintiff, and determine whether the defendants are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity under that version of the facts. Case v. Eslinger, 555 F.3d 1317, 1324-\n\n25 (11th Cir. 2009). Qualified immunity shields government officials performing\n\ndiscretionary functions from liability under § 1983, as long as their conduct “does\n\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.” Id. at 1325 (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). To invoke the defense of qualified immunity, a defendant must\n\nfirst establish he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority. Id.\n\nOnce the defendant has made this showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n\novercome the qualified-immunity defense by showing (1) the defendant violated\n\nhis constitutional rights, and (2) the right at issue was clearly established at the\n\ntime of the alleged misconduct. Terrell v. Smith, 668 F.3d 1244, 1250 (11th Cir.\n\n2012).\n\n      The qualified-immunity inquiry is context-specific; qualified immunity\n\napplies unless the plaintiff can show no reasonable officer in the defendant’s\n\nposition would have taken the same action. See id. To determine whether a\n\nreasonable officer would have known his conduct was unconstitutional, we ask\n\nwhether either (1) under the prevailing case law at the time, a concrete factual basis\n\n\n                                           29\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 30 of 37\n\n\nexisted so that it was obvious to a reasonable officer that his actions violated\n\nfederal law; or (2) the unlawfulness of the officer’s conduct was readily apparent in\n\nspite of the lack of fact-specific case law. Fils v. City of Aventura, 647 F.3d 1272,\n\n1291 (11th Cir. 2011). When officers punish an inmate for filing grievances\n\nconcerning the conditions of his confinement, they violate the inmate’s First\n\nAmendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of\n\ngrievances. Boxer X v. Harris, 437 F.3d 1107, 1112 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\n      To state a First Amendment retaliation claim, an inmate must show (1) he\n\nengaged in constitutionally protected activity; (2) the defendant’s retaliatory\n\nconduct adversely affected his protected activity; and (3) there is a causal\n\nconnection between the retaliatory conduct and the adverse effect. Douglas v.\n\nYates, 535 F.3d 1316, 1321 (11th Cir. 2008). Once the plaintiff establishes his\n\nprotected conduct was a motivating factor behind the alleged harm, the burden\n\nshifts to the defendant to show it would have taken the same action absent the\n\nprotected activity. Smith v. Fla. Dep’t of Corr., 713 F.3d 1059, 1063 (11th Cir.\n\n2013).\n\n      The judge did not err in placing the burden on Maldonado to overcome the\n\nqualified-immunity defense. Maldonado never disputed the defendants were\n\nacting under their discretionary authority; therefore, the burden was on him to\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 31 of 37\n\n\ndemonstrate the defendants violated his clearly established rights. See Terrell, 668\n\nF.3d at 1250.\n\n      The judge did not err in concluding the defendants were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity concerning the May 26, 2011, incident. Maldonado is correct the right\n\nof prison inmates to be free from retaliation for filing grievances concerning the\n\nconditions of their confinement is clearly established. Boxer X, 437 F.3d at 1112.\n\nBut he failed to show that Corporal Kennard had violated that right by pepper-\n\nspraying him on May 26, 2011. See Terrell, 668 F.3d at 1250. Maldonado\n\ncontended he was pepper-sprayed in retaliation for attempting to initiate a sexual\n\nharassment investigation against another officer. Yet, he testified Corporal\n\nKennard escorted him into his cell after he had refused to obey an order to lock\n\ndown, and, while inside the cell, “a few words [were] said,” and that was when\n\nCorporal Kennard pepper-sprayed him. R. at 1201. Consequently, under\n\nMaldonado’s own version of the facts, it is not clear Corporal Kennard pepper-\n\nsprayed Maldonado in retaliation for his attempt to file a grievance or to subdue\n\nhim and obtain his compliance with the officer’s orders. Maldonado therefore did\n\nnot show no reasonable officer would have taken the same action as Corporal\n\nKennard under the circumstance; consequently, qualified immunity applies. See\n\nTerrell, 668 F.3d at 1250.\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 32 of 37\n\n\n      In contrast is the December 23, 2010, incident as to entitlement to qualified\n\nimmunity. Maldonado’s account of the event alleges, after placing him in the\n\nrestraint chair and rendering him defenseless, Officers Ramsey and Maher\n\nthreatened Maldonado would regret bringing any lawsuits against them, then beat\n\nhim, broke his finger, and burned him with a lighter. Maldonado acknowledged he\n\nwas removed from his cell after jamming his cell door in violation of jail rules but\n\ncontended he did not physically resist the officers, and his injuries were sustained\n\nafter he was placed in the restraint chair, when officers would have no disciplinary\n\nreason for using force against him. Based on this account of the facts, Maldonado\n\nshowed Officers Ramsey and Maher violated his clearly established rights by\n\nretaliating against him for engaging in protected conduct. See Terrell, 668 F.3d at\n\n1250; Case, 555 F.3d at 1325; Boxer X, 437 F.3d at 1112. Therefore, the officers\n\nwere not entitled to summary judgment on this claim, based on qualified immunity;\n\nwe reverse the district judge’s granting summary judgment on this claim.\n\nC.    Nondispositive Motions\n\n      Maldonado asserts the district judge erred in denying his motions for\n\nappointment of counsel, an expert witness, permission to enter upon land, to\n\ncompel discovery, and to reinstate Counts II, III, and IV. He represents he was\n\nentitled to the relief sought in each of those motions, and the judge abused her\n\ndiscretion in denying them.\n\n\n                                         32\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 33 of 37\n\n\n      We review motions for appointment of counsel, discovery rulings, and\n\nmotions for reconsideration for abuse of discretion. See Arthur v. King, 500 F.3d\n\n1335, 1343 (11th Cir. 2007) (reconsideration); Smith v. Sch. Bd. of Orange Cnty.,\n\n487 F.3d 1361, 1365 (11th Cir. 2007) (discovery rulings); Bass v. Perrin, 170 F.3d\n\n1312, 1320 (11th Cir. 1999) (appointment of counsel). Under that standard, we\n\nwill not reverse a district judge’s decision, unless we conclude the judge made a\n\nclear error of judgment or applied the wrong legal standard. Josendis v. Wall to\n\nWall Residence Repairs, Inc., 662 F.3d 1292, 1307 (11th Cir. 2011). Although\n\nplaintiffs in civil cases have no constitutional right to counsel, district judges may\n\nappoint counsel for indigent plaintiffs under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1). Bass, 170\n\nF.3d at 1320. Counsel should be appointed only in exceptional circumstances; a\n\ndistrict judge has broad discretion in making that determination. Id. The fact a\n\nplaintiff would be helped by the assistance of an attorney does not, in itself, require\n\nappointment of counsel. Id.\n\n      We will not overturn discovery rulings unless they resulted in substantial\n\nharm to the appellant’s case. Josendis, 662 F.3d at 1307. District judges have\n\nbroad authority to control the scope of discovery and may deny a motion to compel\n\ndiscovery if the discovery sought is irrelevant. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b); Sanderlin v.\n\nSeminole Tribe of Fla., 243 F.3d 1282, 1293 (11th Cir. 2001). Under Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 706, they have discretionary authority to appoint an expert witness,\n\n\n                                          33\n\f             Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 34 of 37\n\n\neither on their own motion or on the motion of a party. Fed. R. Evid. 706(a);\n\nSteele v. Shah, 87 F.3d 1266, 1271 (11th Cir. 1996). Appointment of an expert\n\nwitness may be appropriate, when it is necessary to ensure a just resolution of the\n\nclaim. Steele, 87 F.3d at 1271.\n\n      A party may move to alter or amend a judgment within 28 days after the\n\nentry of judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). A Rule 59(e) motion may be granted\n\nonly on the basis of newly discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact\n\nand may not be used to relitigate old matters or present additional arguments or\n\nevidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment. Arthur, 500\n\nF.3d at 1343.\n\n      The judge did not abuse her discretion in denying any of the motions\n\nMaldonado seeks to appeal. She did not err in denying Maldonado’s motions for\n\nappointment of counsel, because Maldonado did not demonstrate an appointment\n\nwas warranted by exceptional circumstances. Bass, 170 F.3d at 1320. Maldonado\n\nrepeatedly asserted having an attorney would be helpful to him but that is true of\n\nmany pro se litigants and does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. See id.\n\nThe judge also did not abuse her discretion in denying Maldonado’s requests for\n\nappointment of an expert witness. Although a district judge has the authority to\n\nappoint an expert on a party’s motion, the judge is not required to do so. See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 706(a). Because Maldonado did not exhaust any claims concerning\n\n\n                                           34\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 35 of 37\n\n\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, the appointment of medical\n\nexperts was not warranted, and the judge’s refusal to appoint such experts did not\n\nresult in substantial harm to his case. See Josendis, 662 F.3d at 1307; Steele, 87\n\nF.3d at 1271. Similarly, the judge’s refusal to appoint a taser expert did not result\n\nin substantial harm to Maldonado’s case, because his claim concerning the July 12,\n\n2010, taser incident was unexhausted; therefore, his requested expert was\n\nunnecessary. See Josendis, 662 F.3d at 1307; Steele, 87 F.3d at 1271.\n\n      In addition, the judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Maldonado’s\n\nmotions for entry upon land and to compel discovery. She properly concluded it\n\nwould be inappropriate to grant Maldonado’s motion for entry upon land. The\n\nburden of allowing Maldonado, who by then was incarcerated in another facility\n\npursuant to his capital sentence, to inspect and photograph the NCDC would have\n\noutweighed the possible benefit of that discovery, because it did not relate to the\n\ncentral issues in his complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Maldonado’s motion\n\nto compel largely contains broad requests for information about incidents\n\ninvolving other inmates, which were not relevant to his individual retaliation and\n\ndeliberate-indifference claims. Furthermore, Maldonado acknowledged in his\n\nmotion the defendants had produced or were attempting to locate documents\n\nresponsive to his request. Therefore, the judge did not commit a clear error of\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 36 of 37\n\n\njudgment in denying his motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b); Josendis, 662 F.3d at\n\n1307; Sanderlin, 243 F.3d at 1293.\n\n      Finally, the judge did not err in denying Maldonado’s motion for\n\nreconsideration seeking the reinstatement of Counts II, III, and IV. As the judge\n\nnoted, Maldonado’s motion was filed more than 28 days after her order dismissing\n\nthose counts; therefore, it was untimely. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Furthermore,\n\nhis motion did not rely on newly discovered evidence or demonstrate any manifest\n\nerrors of law or fact in the judge’s screening order. Arthur, 500 F.3d at 1343.\n\nInstead, Maldonado contended he could have drafted a better complaint if his\n\naccess to the prison law library had not been hindered and erroneously asserted the\n\njudge had dismissed the relevant counts on qualified-immunity grounds.\n\nConsequently, Maldonado did not show reconsideration was warranted, and the\n\njudge’s denial of his motion was not an abuse of discretion. See Arthur, 500 F.3d\n\nat 1343.\n\n                               III. CONCLUSION\n\n      As we have explained, we vacate and remand granting of summary\n\njudgment in part, regarding the December 23, 2010, retaliation claim but affirm\n\ngranting summary judgment regarding Maldonado’s deliberate indifference and\n\nother retaliation claims. We also affirm the district judge’s denial of Maldonado’s\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 37 of 37\n\n\nrequests for appointment of counsel, appointment of an expert witness, permission\n\nto enter upon land, to compel discovery, and to reinstate Counts II, III, and IV.\n\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f",

Maldonado, a Georgia death-row inmate proceeding pro se, appeals\n\nthe district judge’s granting summary judgment to the Newton County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment defendants on his 42 U.S.C. § 1983 complaint. We affirm in part,\n\nvacate in part, and remand.\n\n                               I. BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Facts\n\n      On August 31, 2012, Maldonado was convicted in Georgia state court of\n\nmalice murder, felony murder, armed robbery, concealing the death of another, and\n\nforgery; he was sentenced to death. Maldonado currently is confined at the\n\nGeorgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison, to which he was transferred on\n\nSeptember 7, 2012. From June 15, 2009, through September 7, 2012, Maldonado\n\nwas detained at the Newton County Detention Center (“NCDC”). This § 1983\n\naction relates to Maldonado’s pretrial confinement at the NCDC, during which\n\ntime he claims corrections officers retaliated against him, were deliberately\n\n\n                                          2\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 3 of 37\n\n\nindifferent to his serious medical needs, and committed various other wrongs\n\nagainst him.\n\n      1.       Retaliation Claims\n\n      In his complaint, Maldonado alleged Officer First Name Unknown (“FNU”)\n\nMyrie assaulted him various times between June and July 2010. Maldonado\n\nexplained at his deposition this allegation referred to an incident that occurred on\n\nJune 26, 2010, when Officer Myrie, at the direction of Officer Keith Brown, who\n\nwas in the control tower, assaulted him as he was coming out of visitation.\n\nSubsequently, Maldonado was taken to intake to be placed on suicide watch and\n\nallegedly was denied medical treatment by Lieutenant Selena Williams. In an\n\ninmate-grievance form dated June 29, 2010, Maldonado complained he had been\n\nremoved to suicide watch for no apparent reason after being assaulted by Officer\n\nMyrie and stated Officer Brown had confiscated his personal-hygiene items and\n\nlaw books.\n\n      Maldonado’s jail medical file showed he was seen by a nurse on June 26,\n\n2010, at the request of Lieutenant Williams. Maldonado complained his right\n\nshoulder had been dislocated, although he was able to pull his shirt over his head,\n\nmove both arms easily, and unsnap his uniform. Maldonado also stated an officer\n\nhad choked him, but no swelling or discoloration was noted around his throat. He\n\nhad reddened areas on both shoulders and his head, and medical personnel directed\n\n\n                                             3\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 4 of 37\n\n\nofficers to give him ice for his injuries. Maldonado was examined again on June\n\n29 and 30, 2010, after complaining of pain in his right shoulder, which was bruised\n\nand slightly swollen. Medical staff provided Maldonado over-the-counter\n\nmedication for his pain and recommended an ice pack.\n\n      On July 12, 2010, Maldonado argued with Officer Novel Ellis after she\n\naccused him of taking another inmate’s laundry bag. Sergeant Clarence White and\n\nanother officer, who is not a defendant in this action, escorted Maldonado first to\n\ndisciplinary segregation and then to a cell in the medical unit. While he was in the\n\nmedical unit, Maldonado states Sergeant White came into his cell, threw him to the\n\nground, and said something like “you won’t put my name in a lawsuit”; Sergeant\n\nWhite then tased Maldonado on the left side of his face. R. at 1124.\n\n      Maldonado was examined by prison medical staff following this incident,\n\nand complained to the nurse that he had been tased in the face. The nurse noted\n\nredness on the left side of Maldonado’s face but concluded it did not require any\n\ntreatment. Maldonado did not file an inmate-grievance form concerning this\n\nincident.\n\n      On July 29, 2010, Maldonado posted a note on his cell door asking to be left\n\nalone; it stated he had enough commissary items to last him for several weeks.\n\nLieutenant Williams and Corporal George Jefferson went into Maldonado’s cell;\n\nJefferson restrained Maldonado while Williams removed his personal items.\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 5 of 37\n\n\nWilliams reportedly said something like “let’s see how you are going to survive\n\nwithout your commissary.” R. at 142, 1130. In an undated letter addressed to\n\nLieutenant FNU Goodman, who is not a defendant in this action, Maldonado listed\n\na number of items that allegedly were taken from his cell, when he was removed\n\nfrom Seg-1, his regular housing unit, on July 12, 2010. On July 29, 2010,\n\nMaldonado filed an inmate request form and asked to speak to Lieutenant\n\nGoodman about officers taking his personal items in retaliation for grievances he\n\nhad filed. He again requested the replacement of his personal items in an inmate-\n\nrequest form dated September 13, 2010. At the bottom of that form, Lieutenant\n\nGoodman noted the items were replaced on September 14, 2010. In a\n\nmemorandum dated September 14, 2010, and addressed to Maldonado, Lieutenant\n\nGoodman listed the items Maldonado had received, and Maldonado signed at the\n\nbottom, acknowledging receipt of those items.\n\n      On August 9, 2010, Sergeant White, on the orders of Captain Sammy Banks,\n\nattempted to place Maldonado in disciplinary segregation, allegedly for no\n\napparent reason. Maldonado refused to go to disciplinary segregation; instead, he\n\nwas placed on suicide watch against his will. Because Maldonado did not\n\nvoluntarily remove his clothing, Sergeant White and Corporal Jefferson undressed\n\nhim and put him in a suicide suit. Maldonado was “manhandled” by the officers\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 6 of 37\n\n\nduring this process, but he did not suffer any physical injuries. R. at 1152. He did\n\nnot file a grievance concerning this incident.\n\n      On September 2, 2010, Captain Banks and Officer Brice Smith ordered\n\nMaldonado to be placed in disciplinary segregation with a convicted murderer,\n\narmed robber, and drug trafficker, allegedly for discriminatory and retaliatory\n\nreasons. Maldonado did not file a grievance concerning this incident.\n\n      On September 20, 2010, Sergeant Freeman Moody ordered Maldonado to\n\nget out of the shower. Maldonado did not comply immediately and told Moody he\n\nneeded to finish rinsing off. Moody allegedly then dragged Maldonado out of the\n\nshower and pushed him into his cell, causing Maldonado to slip and hurt his back.\n\nMaldonado began swearing at Moody and spit on the window of his cell door.\n\nMoody told Maldonado he was going to file disciplinary charges against him.\n\nMaldonado did not file a grievance concerning this incident.\n\n      On December 23, 2010, after being threatened by another inmate,\n\nMaldonado jammed the door to his cell. Jail staff removed the door, and Officers\n\nJoe Maher and Wesley Ramsey removed Maldonado from his cell. Officers Maher\n\nand Ramsey told Maldonado they were taking him to suicide watch, but\n\nMaldonado insisted he was not suicidal and refused to put on a suicide suit.\n\nOfficers Maher and Ramsey then placed Maldonado in a restraint chair with both\n\nhis hands and feet restrained. According to Maldonado, once he was in the\n\n\n                                          6\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 7 of 37\n\n\nrestraint chair, Officers Maher and Ramsey told him to “drop [their] name from\n\nany lawsuit” he had filed and threatened he would “regret bringing their name in\n\nany type of lawsuit”; they then broke his left pinky finger, kicked him, and burned\n\nhim with a lighter. R. at 1179-80. On December 27, 2010, Maldonado filed an\n\ninmate-grievance form and complained he was taken to intake on December 23,\n\n2010, to be placed on suicide watch, even though he was not suicidal; thereafter\n\nOfficers Maher and Ramsey placed him in the restraint chair, beat him, tortured\n\nhim, and burned him with a lighter.\n\n      At approximately 1 a.m. on December 24, 2010, after Maldonado had been\n\nplaced in the restraint chair, a nurse was called to examine him. Maldonado told\n\nthe nurse officers had hit him in the head, kicked him in the ribs, and broken his\n\nfinger. The nurse noted Maldonado was able to move his fingers without any\n\nproblem, but could not flex his left index finger, which was swollen. The nurse\n\nchecked on Maldonado again at 2:30 a.m. and noted his left index finger was\n\nslightly discolored. The following day, Maldonado complained his left wrist was\n\nbroken, but the nurse noted no swelling or discoloration. On December 27, 2010,\n\nan x-ray was taken of Maldonado’s left wrist, which revealed no abnormality or\n\nfracture.\n\n      On May 26, 2011, Maldonado came out of his cell and asked to speak to a\n\nsupervisor or internal-affairs investigator to make a complaint about an officer who\n\n\n                                          7\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016      Page: 8 of 37\n\n\nwas harassing him sexually. Officers told Maldonado to lock down in his cell, but\n\nMaldonado refused to do so until he had spoken to a supervisor. Corporal Maurice\n\nKennard escorted Maldonado back into his cell. Maldonado was not combative,\n\nbut once inside the cell, “a few words [were] said,” and Corporal Kennard pepper-\n\nsprayed Maldonado in the face. R. at 1201. After the incident, Sergeant White\n\nallegedly went into Maldonado’s cell and threatened him to stop pursuing lawsuits\n\nor internal investigations against the officers. A nurse examined Maldonado in his\n\ncell after he was pepper-sprayed; Maldonado then showered to wash off the pepper\n\nspray. The following day, May 27, 2011, Maldonado filed a grievance asserting\n\nthe pepper-spray incident was in retaliation for his attempt to make a sexual\n\nharassment complaint. 1\n\n       On August 8, 2011, Corporal Kennard and Officer Brown allegedly attacked\n\nMaldonado in his cell after Maldonado accidentally broke a TV remote control,\n\nwhen he tossed it. According to Maldonado, the officers punched him, slammed\n\nhim on the floor, and broke his tooth. Following this incident, medical personnel\n\nwere called to examine Maldonado. The nurse noted Maldonado’s forehead and\n\nright ear were red, and he had an abrasion on his left elbow, but he did not have\n\nany severe injuries. From August 9 through 16, 2011, medical staff checked on\n       1\n         In his complaint, Maldonado alleged Sergeant Octavis Campbell had harassed him\nsexually and would retaliate against him if he refused to comply with her demands. He also\nalleged Campbell had denied him access to the prison mail system. At summary judgment, with\nMaldonado’s consent, the district judge dismissed Campbell as a defendant for lack of service;\nMaldonado does not challenge that decision on appeal.\n                                              8\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 9 of 37\n\n\nMaldonado daily. They also checked on him on August 19 and 22, 2011, and daily\n\non August 24 through 30, 2011. Maldonado did not complain to medical staff\n\nduring those visits. On August 10, 2011, Maldonado filed an inmate request form\n\nand complained he had been punished and beaten for “a remote control that came\n\napart & for not cleaning up.” R. at 1435.\n\n      Finally, according to Maldonado, on August 12, 2011, Lieutenant Williams\n\nand Sergeant Smith trashed his cell and disposed of $100 worth of commissary\n\nitems and half of his discovery from his criminal case. Between August 8 and 14,\n\n2011, Maldonado filed several requests seeking the return of his discovery material\n\nand commissary items. The response on the form dated August 14, 2011, shows\n\nMaldonado’s property had been returned.\n\n      2.    Deliberate Indifference Claims\n\n      In his complaint, Maldonado generally alleged he had been denied medical\n\nattention for his serious health issues between June and October of 2011. At his\n\ndeposition, Maldonado testified his deliberate-indifference claim was based on the\n\nJune 26, 2010, July 12, 2010, December 23, 2010, and May 26, 2011, incidents\n\npreviously described. Maldonado did not file any grievances concerning any\n\ndeprivation or delay of medical treatment.\n\n      3.    Other Claims\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 10 of 37\n\n\n      Maldonado also alleged officers failed to protect him from being attacked by\n\nhis former cellmate, Joseph White, on July 3 and 10, 2010. Maldonado represents\n\nWhite had assaulted him both physically and sexually on several prior occasions.\n\nMaldonado had reported those incidents to corrections officers and requested his\n\nvisitation schedule be changed, so it would not overlap that of White, but officers\n\nfailed to take any action. On July 3, 2010, while Maldonado was waiting for\n\nvisitation, White attacked him. Maldonado reported the assault to Officer Ellis,\n\nwho simply told the two men they needed to work out their problems. On July 10,\n\n2010, Maldonado’s visitation schedule had not been changed, and White again\n\nassaulted Maldonado.\n\n      In addition, Maldonado generally alleged Lieutenant Williams, Sergeant\n\nSmith, and Captain Banks had denied him access to the law library, clergy visits,\n\nand religious materials. In particular, on August 17, 2010, Captain Banks denied\n\nMaldonado access to the law library and clergy visits, while he was being held in a\n\nvideo-monitored intake cell after being released from suicide watch. Maldonado\n\nalso claimed Sergeant Smith had denied him a refund for store goods that had been\n\nlost by jail custodians on May 31, 2011, and alleged a jail-staff member, Mrs.\n\nOliver, who is not a defendant in this action, had tampered with his mail.\n\nB.    District Court Proceedings\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 11 of 37\n\n\n      Maldonado initiated this action in June 2011 by filing in the district court a\n\nletter, challenging the conditions of his pretrial confinement in the NCDC. His\n\npreviously filed complaint, raising similar issues regarding his confinement at the\n\nNCDC, had been dismissed for failure to state a claim on June 17, 2010. The\n\ndistrict judge had directed Maldonado to file an amended complaint limited to any\n\nalleged violations of his rights that had occurred after dismissal of his prior suit.\n\nMaldonado complied and filed a second amended complaint (“SAC”), which is the\n\noperative complaint in this case. Maldonado also moved for appointment of\n\ncounsel and asserted he could not afford an attorney and was unable to represent\n\nhimself effectively.\n\n      In his SAC, Maldonado named as defendants Newton County, the Newton\n\nCounty Sheriff’s Office, Sheriff Ezell Brown, and numerous individual corrections\n\nofficers. He alleged nine counts: (1) violation of his First, Fourth, Eighth, and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights against Newton County (Count I); (2) violation of\n\nhis First, Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights against the individual\n\ndefendants (Count II); (3) assault and battery against Officers Joe Maher, Wesley\n\nRamsey, Keith Brown, and inmate Joseph White (Count III); (4) intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, apparently against all of the individual defendants\n\n(Count IV); (5) negligent retention against Newton County (Count V); (6) violation\n\nof his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241 against Newton County (Count VI);\n\n\n                                           11\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 12 of 37\n\n\n(7) violation of his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 241 against the individual\n\ndefendants (Count VII); (8) violation of his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. § 242\n\nagainst Newton County (Count VIII); and (9) violation of his civil rights under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 242 against the individual defendants (Count IX).\n\n       The district judge screened Maldonado’s complaint under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1915A. On September 27, 2012, the judge issued an order dismissing all of\n\nMaldonado’s claims except his § 1983 deliberate indifference and retaliation\n\nclaims against the individual officers and his state-law claims against inmate\n\nJoseph White.2 The judge also denied Maldonado’s motion for appointment of\n\ncounsel, subject to reconsideration at a later time, because the facts were not\n\nsufficiently substantiated at that time to warrant appointment of counsel.3 On\n\nJanuary 8, 2013, Maldonado filed an untimely motion for reconsideration of the\n\nscreening order and sought reinstatement of Counts II (§ 1983 claim against the\n\nindividual officers), III (assault and battery), and IV (intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress). The judge denied Maldonado’s motion, because it did not\n\nwarrant reconsideration of the screening order and was untimely.\n\n\n       2\n           Consequently, the district judge dismissed at the screening stage Maldonado’s claims\nthat jail staff had (1) failed to protect him from being attacked by inmate Joseph White on July 3\nand 10, 2010, (2) denied him access to the law library and clergy visits on August 17, 2010,\n(3) denied him a refund for personal goods lost on May 31, 2011, and (4) tampered with his mail.\nMaldonado does not argue on appeal the judge erred in dismissing these claims.\n       3\n        Maldonado made several subsequent requests for the appointment of counsel, all of\nwhich the judge denied.\n                                               12\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 13 of 37\n\n\n      As discovery proceeded, Maldonado moved for appointment of a medical\n\ndoctor and a psychiatrist to provide expert opinions concerning the physical and\n\nmental injuries he had suffered from the defendants’ abuses. A magistrate judge\n\ndenied Maldonado’s motion and concluded Maldonado had not substantiated\n\nsufficiently the need for appointment of an expert to ensure a just resolution of his\n\ncase. Maldonado later filed a motion to compel discovery and asserted the\n\ndefendants failed to respond to numerous requests for production of documents and\n\nwere delaying intentionally disclosure of other requested documents. While his\n\nmotion to compel was pending, Maldonado filed a motion for inspection of\n\ntangible items and entry upon land and requested permission to enter the NCDC to\n\ninspect the premises and to take measurements, photographs, and video. He\n\nrepresented this evidence was necessary to refute various assertions made by the\n\nindividual defendants in their responses to interrogatories.\n\n      Subsequently, defendants moved for summary judgment. In relevant part,\n\nthey argued Maldonado had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, as\n\nrequired by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (“PLRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a),\n\nbecause he did not file any grievances naming any of the individual defendants\n\nconcerning the issues raised in this case. The defendants further contended no\n\nevidence supported Maldonado’s claims of retaliation, and Maldonado would have\n\nbeen disciplined regardless of his protected conduct. Concerning Maldonado’s\n\n\n                                          13\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 14 of 37\n\n\nclaim of deliberate indifference regarding his medical needs, the defendants argued\n\nthe evidence showed Maldonado had received adequate medical care during his\n\nincarceration at the NCDC. Finally, they asserted they were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity concerning both of Maldonado’s claims.\n\n      Before responding to the motion for summary judgment, Maldonado\n\nrenewed his request for appointment of a medical expert and contended he also\n\nneeded an expert witness to refute the defendants’ taser expert. In his response to\n\nthe motion for summary judgment, Maldonado maintained he did exhaust his\n\navailable administrative remedies. He asserted he filed grievances concerning\n\nsome of the issues raised in this lawsuit, but the defendants had prevented him\n\nfrom filing grievances concerning other instances of mistreatment. Under these\n\ncircumstances, Maldonado contended he should not be penalized for failing to\n\nexhaust his administrative remedies, because his failure was caused by the\n\ndefendants’ misconduct.\n\n      Concerning his retaliation claims, Maldonado insisted there was a causal\n\nconnection between the defendants’ abuses and his many grievances and legal\n\ncomplaints. He also contested the defendants’ assertion he would have been\n\ndisciplined despite his protected conduct. Maldonado further argued the\n\ndefendants were not entitled to summary judgment on his deliberate-indifference\n\nclaims, because he presented evidence showing the defendants denied or delayed\n\n\n                                         14\n\f              Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 15 of 37\n\n\nmedical treatment. Finally, he contended the defendants were not entitled to\n\nqualified immunity, because he had shown they violated his clearly established\n\nconstitutional rights.\n\n      In support of his response, Maldonado filed a number of documents,\n\nincluding a copy of the NCDC Inmate Handbook, dated January 2009. The\n\nHandbook provided an inmate who wishes to file a grievance must:\n\n      a.            Request a grievance form from the security officer.\n\n      b.            Write on the grievance form the date and time of the\n                    occurrence, and the name of the facility, staff, and\n                    inmates involved, and a detailed description of the\n                    incident.\n\n      c.            A grievance must be submitted within five days of the\n                    incident or discovery of the matter being grieved. . . .\n\nR. at 1566.\n\n      A magistrate judge issued a final Report and Recommendation (“R&R”),\n\nwhich addressed Maldonado’s pending motions as well as the defendants’ motion\n\nfor summary judgment. As a preliminary matter, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended Sergeant Octavis Campbell, Officer FNU Myrie, and inmate Joseph\n\nWhite be dismissed for lack of service. The magistrate judge then denied\n\nMaldonado’s motion for entry upon land, because he had not demonstrated the\n\nnecessary discovery could not be accomplished through other means, and his\n\nrequest was not justified in view of the limitations imposed on him by his\n\n\n                                          15\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 16 of 37\n\n\nincarceration for his capital sentence. Similarly, the magistrate judge denied\n\nMaldonado’s motion to compel discovery and found the material Maldonado\n\nsought was cumulative, irrelevant, or exceeded the scope of discovery. For the\n\nsame reasons, the magistrate judge also denied Maldonado’s motion for\n\nappointment of an expert witness.\n\n      Regarding the motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge first\n\nidentified the following incidents of misconduct, alleged in the SAC and permitted\n\nto proceed in the screening order, as the basis for Maldonado’s § 1983 retaliation\n\nclaim: (1) the July 12, 2010, taser incident, (2) the July 29, 2010, confiscation of\n\nproperty, (3) the August 9, 2010, move to suicide watch, (4) the September 2,\n\n2010, move to disciplinary segregation, (5) the December 23, 2010, assault by\n\nOfficers Maher and Ramsey, (6) the May 26, 2011, pepper-spray incident, (7) the\n\nAugust 8, 2011, attack by Corporal Kennard and Officer Brown, and (8) the\n\nAugust 12, 2011, destruction of his property. Concerning Maldonado’s deliberate-\n\nindifference claim, the magistrate judge noted the SAC generally alleged deliberate\n\nindifference to his medical needs between June and October 2011 but did not\n\nidentify any specific instances that post-dated the dismissal of his prior suit.\n\n      In accordance with our precedent, the magistrate judge construed the motion\n\nfor summary judgment as a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) motion to\n\ndismiss in addressing the PLRA exhaustion requirement. The magistrate judge\n\n\n                                          16\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 17 of 37\n\n\nconcluded Maldonado had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies concerning\n\nhis deliberate-indifference claims and his retaliation claims regarding the incidents\n\non July 12, 2010, August 9, 2010, September 2, 2010, May 26, 2011, August 8,\n\n2011, and August 12, 2011, because he had failed to submit copies of any\n\nadministrative grievances concerning those claims. The magistrate judge also\n\ndetermined Maldonado did not properly exhaust his claim concerning the\n\nDecember 23, 2010, incident, because his administrative grievance did not state a\n\nretaliation claim. Finally, the magistrate judge found Maldonado properly had\n\ngrieved the July 29, 2010, incident as a retaliation claim but concluded this claim\n\nshould be dismissed, because the grievance fully was resolved administratively.\n\nConsequently, the magistrate judge concluded the defendants were entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on all of Maldonado’s claims.\n\n       Maldonado objected to the R&R and contended the magistrate judge had\n\nerred in denying his motions to compel and for entry upon land. Regarding the\n\nmotion for summary judgment, Maldonado contended the magistrate judge had\n\nfailed to address his claim he was assaulted by Officer Myrie on June 26, 2010, but\n\ndid not otherwise object to the magistrate judge’s recitation of the retaliation\n\nclaims remaining on summary judgment. 4 Maldonado argued the magistrate judge\n\n\n\n       4\n         Aside from the June 26, 2010, claim, Maldonado cannot challenge on appeal the district\njudge’s failure to address other retaliation claims he may have raised that were not discussed in\n                                               17\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016      Page: 18 of 37\n\n\nalso erred in concluding he had not exhausted his claim concerning the May 26,\n\n2011, incident and directed the judge’s attention to the May 27, 2011, grievance he\n\nhad filed. Maldonado further asserted his failure to exhaust his other retaliation\n\nand deliberate-indifference claims was not his fault, because defendants had\n\nprevented him from filing grievances, destroyed his grievances, or failed to\n\ninvestigate them properly. Finally, Maldonado stated he had no objection to the\n\ndismissal of Sergeant Campbell, Officer Myrie, and inmate Joseph White for lack\n\nof service.\n\n       The district judge adopted the R&R with some modifications and overruled\n\nMaldonado’s objections. Because Maldonado did not object to the dismissal of\n\nSergeant Campbell, Officer Myrie, and Joseph White, the district judge adopted\n\nthe magistrate judge’s recommendation those defendants, and Maldonado’s claims\n\nagainst them, be dismissed. The judge concluded the magistrate judge did not\n\nclearly err in denying Maldonado’s discovery motions and noted Maldonado’s\n\nobjections showed he had sought to use discovery to collect evidence of a pattern\n\nof constitutional violations against other prisoners to bolster his own claims, which\n\nwas inappropriate in this case. The judge further noted Maldonado did not object\n\n\n\n\nthe R&R, because he did not object to the omission of these claims in his objections to the R&R.\nSee 11th Cir. R. 3-1.\n                                               18\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 19 of 37\n\n\nspecifically to the portion of the magistrate judge’s order setting out Maldonado’s\n\nretaliation claims and adopted that portion of the R&R. 5\n\n       Concerning the exhaustion issue, the district judge agreed the summary\n\njudgment motion should be treated as a Rule 12(b) motion. The judge adopted the\n\nmagistrate judge’s conclusion that Maldonado had failed to exhaust his deliberate-\n\nindifference claims, because he never properly filed any written grievances raising\n\nthose claims. Similarly, the judge adopted the R&R conclusions that (1) for the\n\nincidents on July 12, 2010, August 9, 2010, September 2, 2010, December 23,\n\n2010, August 8, 2011, and August 12, 2011, Maldonado either did not file\n\ngrievances or did not assert retaliation claims in his grievances, and\n\n(2) Maldonado’s grievance concerning the July 29, 2010, incident was resolved\n\nfully. Regarding the May 26, 2011, incident, however, the district judge concluded\n\nMaldonado had exhausted his administrative remedies. Although not included in\n\nhis summary judgment filings, Maldonado had attached a grievance form\n\n       5\n         Maldonado did raise a specific objection concerning the magistrate judge’s failure to\naddress the June 26, 2010, attack by Officer Myrie. The judge properly dismissed that claim as to\nOfficer Myrie for lack of service. The judge failed to address, however, Maldonado’s claims\nOfficer Brown directed Officer Myrie to assault him, and Lieutenant Williams thereafter denied\nhim medical treatment. Nevertheless, we may affirm the district judge’s judgment on any\nground, Thomas v.

Maldonado’s grievance did not mention Lieutenant Williams or\nallege any denial of medical treatment; the record shows Maldonado received medical attention\non June 26, 2010, at Lieutenant Williams’s request. In addition, Maldonado’s grievance\nmentioned Officer Brown only in connection with the confiscation of his property, which did not\nform a part of his claim in the district court and about which he does not complain on appeal.\nMaldonado also did not allege Officer Brown was involved in or responsible for the assault by\nOfficer Myrie. Accordingly, these claims properly were dismissed.\n                                               19\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 20 of 37\n\n\nconcerning the May 26, 2011, incident to an earlier filing; that grievance form\n\nspecifically accused Corporal Kennard and Sergeant White of retaliating against\n\nhim.\n\n       Nevertheless, the judge concluded dismissal of all of Maldonado’s § 1983\n\nclaims was warranted on qualified immunity. The judge stated it was “undisputed\n\nthat the Individual Officers were acting within the scope of their discretionary\n\nauthority at the time of the alleged violations.” R. at 2009-10. Consequently,\n\nMaldonado bore the burden of showing the officers had violated his clearly\n\nestablished constitutional rights. The district judge stated Maldonado had made no\n\neffort to satisfy that burden in either his response to the motion for summary\n\njudgment or his objections to the R&R and concluded Maldonado could not have\n\nshown his rights were clearly established. Concerning the May 26, 2011, incident,\n\nthe judge explained Maldonado’s deposition testimony showed he had failed to\n\ncomply with officers’ orders. Therefore, the evidence was insufficient for the\n\njudge to conclude Corporal Kennard had pepper-sprayed Maldonado for punitive\n\npurposes rather than to induce compliance with a lawful order. Furthermore,\n\nMaldonado did not respond to the qualified-immunity defense at all, much less\n\nprovide the judge with any “controlling and materially similar case” demonstrating\n\nthe use of pepper spray to obtain compliance with a lawful order was\n\nunconstitutional. Consequently, the judge concluded the individual defendants\n\n\n                                         20\n\f               Case: 15-10867       Date Filed: 04/26/2016       Page: 21 of 37\n\n\nwere entitled to summary judgment regarding the May 26, 2011, incident based on\n\nqualified immunity. The judge further noted qualified immunity would bar all of\n\nMaldonado’s § 1983 claims, because of his failure to respond to that defense.\n\nTherefore, the judge adopted the R&R and granted the individual defendants’\n\nmotion for summary judgment. 6\n\n                                     II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\n       On appeal, Maldonado argues the district judge erroneously construed the\n\nexhaustion portion of the motion for summary judgment as a Rule 12(b) motion.\n\nHe also contends the defendants waived their failure-to-exhaust defense by their\n\naffirmative misconduct, asserts the defendants failed to prove that defense, and\n\nargues he demonstrated a genuine issue of fact concerning the availability of\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n       We review de novo a district judge’s application of 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a),\n\nthe PLRA exhaustion requirement.

In this context, the judge may consider facts\n       6\n         The judge failed to address Maldonado’s claim Officer Moody retaliated against him,\non September 20, 2010, by dragging him out of the shower and then pushing him, causing a back\ninjury. Nevertheless, we may affirm a district judge’s judgment on any ground, see Thomas, 506\nF.3d at 1364, and it is clear from the record Maldonado did not file any grievances regarding this\nincident. Because he failed to exhaust the September 20, 2010, claim, it properly was dismissed.\n                                               21\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 22 of 37\n\n\noutside of the pleadings and resolve factual disputes, as long as those factual\n\ndisputes do not decide the merits, and the parties have had a sufficient opportunity\n\nto develop the record. Id. at 1376. We review a district judge’s factual findings\n\nconcerning the exhaustion requirement for clear error. Id. at 1377.\n\n      Under § 1997e(a), prisoners may not bring a § 1983 action “until such\n\nadministrative remedies as are available are exhausted.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a).\n\nThe defendant bears the burden of showing the plaintiff failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies. Turner v. Burnside, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78100\"><a href=\"/opinion/78100/turner-v-burnside/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1082 (11th Cir.\n\n2008). The PLRA exhaustion requirement serves to allow prison officials to\n\nresolve complaints internally before being subject to suit, reduce litigation to the\n\nextent complaints are satisfactorily resolved, and improve the litigation that does\n\noccur by creating an administrative record. Jones v. Bock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 219, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145763\"><a href=\"/opinion/145763/jones-v-bock/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 923 (2007). To satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a prisoner must\n\ncomplete the administrative process in accordance with the applicable grievance\n\nprocedures set by the prison. Id. at 218, 127 S. Ct. at 922-23. The prison’s\n\nrequirements, rather than the PLRA, dictate the level of detail necessary for proper\n\nexhaustion. Id.\n\n      For an administrative remedy to be “available” under the PLRA, it must be\n\n“capable of use for the accomplishment of its purpose.” Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084\n\n(citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted). Consequently,\n\n\n                                          22\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 23 of 37\n\n\nretaliation or threats of retaliation may make administrative remedies unavailable\n\nto an inmate. Id. at 1084-85. Specifically, “a prison official’s serious threats of\n\nsubstantial retaliation against an inmate for lodging or pursuing in good faith a\n\ngrievance” render the administrative remedy unavailable if (1) the threat actually\n\ndeterred the plaintiff from filing a grievance or pursuing some aspect of the\n\nadministrative process, and (2) the threat is one that would deter a reasonable\n\ninmate of ordinary firmness. Id. at 1085. We also have noted, without deciding\n\nfor this circuit, that other courts have held administrative remedies are also\n\nunavailable, when prison officials prevent the filing of grievances or fail to respond\n\nto grievances that are filed. Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1373 n.6.\n\n      The district judge correctly applied our precedent in treating the exhaustion\n\ndefense as an unenumerated Rule 12(b) motion, and Maldonado had ample\n\nopportunity to develop the record concerning that issue. Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374-\n\n76. Regarding the merits of the exhaustion issue, the judge did not err in\n\nconcluding Maldonado failed to exhaust his administrative remedies concerning\n\nhis claim the individual officers were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical\n\nneeds, because a review of the record does not reveal any grievances filed by\n\nMaldonado concerning any deprivation or delay of medical treatment. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a); Jones, 549 U.S. at 218, 127 S. Ct. at 922-23. Furthermore, the record\n\nshows Maldonado promptly received medical treatment following each of the four\n\n\n                                          23\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 24 of 37\n\n\nincidents he identified in his deposition as supporting his deliberate- indifference\n\nclaim. Regarding his retaliation claims, the record contains no grievances\n\nconcerning the July 12, 2010, August 9, 2010, or September 2, 2010 incidents.\n\n      Maldonado argues any failure to exhaust on his part should be excused,\n\nbecause it was caused by defendants’ retaliatory conduct. He has not\n\ndemonstrated, however, he actually was deterred from filing grievances concerning\n\nthe three incidents about which he complains. See Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85.\n\nMaldonado did not identify any threats made by officers in connection with the\n\nAugust 9, 2010, incident, in which he allegedly was placed on suicide watch\n\nwithout cause. He further did not assert the defendants prevented him from filing a\n\ngrievance concerning the August 9, 2010, incident and acknowledged he did not\n\nsuffer any injuries from that incident other than being “manhandled.” R. at 1153.\n\nSimilarly, Maldonado did not assert the defendants made any threats or otherwise\n\nprevented him from filing a grievance concerning the September 2, 2010, incident,\n\nin which he allegedly was moved to Seg-2 for no reason. Therefore, Maldonado\n\ndid not show the defendants prevented him, via threats or otherwise, from filing a\n\ngrievance concerning the August 9, 2010, or September 2, 2010, incidents. See\n\nTurner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85.\n\n      Concerning the July 12, 2010, incident, Maldonado did assert that just\n\nbefore Officer White tased him in the face, White said something like “you won’t\n\n\n                                          24\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 25 of 37\n\n\nput my name in a lawsuit.” R. at 1124. Although this conduct could constitute the\n\nsort of serious threat that would deter an ordinary prisoner from filing a grievance,\n\nMaldonado never asserted he was actually deterred by White’s threat from filing a\n\ngrievance concerning that incident. See Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85. Moreover,\n\nthe record contains dozens of grievance forms filed by Maldonado throughout the\n\ncourse of his confinement at the NCDC, including complaints related to other\n\nincidents in which Maldonado alleged officers used physical force against him and\n\nthreatened him not to pursue legal action. Even if Maldonado’s allegations\n\nconcerning the defendants’ retaliatory conduct are true, he was not actually\n\ndeterred from filing grievances or pursuing legal action because of their conduct.\n\nSee Turner, 541 F.3d at 1084-85.\n\n      The record also contains no grievance referring to the August 12, 2011,\n\nincident, in which officers allegedly trashed Maldonado’s cell and disposed of his\n\npersonal property. There are, however, several grievance forms dated August 8, 9,\n\n11, and 14, 2011, in which Maldonado requested the return of property taken from\n\nhim on August 8 and 9, 2011. Given the nature of these grievances and their\n\ntemporal proximity to the August 12, 2011, date, it is possible Maldonado was\n\nmistaken about the date on which his property was taken. Nevertheless, this claim\n\nappears to have been resolved administratively, because the response on the\n\nAugust 14, 2011, grievance form shows Maldonado’s property was returned to\n\n\n                                         25\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 26 of 37\n\n\nhim. Consequently, the district judge properly dismissed the August 12, 2011,\n\nclaim, either because it was unexhausted or because it was resolved internally. See\n\nJones, 549 U.S. at 219, 127 S. Ct. at 923 (noting one of the purposes of the PLRA\n\nexhaustion requirement is to reduce litigation to the extent complaints are\n\nsatisfactorily resolved at the administrative level).\n\n      The judge also did not err in dismissing Maldonado’s claim concerning the\n\nJuly 29, 2010, incident, involving the confiscation of his personal items, because\n\nthat claim was fully resolved administratively. Maldonado filed several grievances\n\nconcerning the confiscation of his property and explicitly stated he believed the\n\nofficers acted in retaliation for his previous grievances. The record shows,\n\nhowever, all of Maldonado’s items were returned or replaced, and Maldonado\n\nsigned acknowledgments so stating. Therefore, Maldonado’s claim, though\n\nexhausted, properly was dismissed. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 219, 127 S. Ct. at 923.\n\n      In contrast, the judge erred in concluding Maldonado failed to exhaust his\n\nadministrative remedies for the December 23, 2010, and August 8, 2011, incidents,\n\nbased on the judge’s finding that his grievances concerning those incidents did not\n\nstate retaliation claims. We have not addressed whether, to exhaust administrative\n\nremedies for purposes of the PLRA, an inmate’s administrative grievance must\n\nhave alleged the specific legal theory he later pursues in a § 1983 action. The\n\nexhaustion requirement, allowing prison officials to address complaints in the first\n\n\n                                           26\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 27 of 37\n\n\ninstance, is satisfied as long as the inmate’s grievance provides sufficient detail to\n\nallow prison officials to investigate the alleged incident. See Jones, 549 U.S. at\n\n219, 127 S. Ct. at 923. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has held an inmate need\n\ncomply only with the prison grievance procedures to satisfy the exhaustion\n\nrequirement and has rejected attempts by courts to read additional procedural\n\nrequirements into the PLRA. See id. at 202, 218, 127 S. Ct. at 914, 922-23.\n\nConsequently, the judge erred in concluding Maldonado’s grievances were\n\ninadequate for purposes of exhaustion, because they did not allege a retaliatory\n\nmotive.\n\n      Nevertheless, regarding the August 8, 2011, incident, the judge ultimately\n\nwas correct in concluding Maldonado did not properly exhaust his claim. The\n\nNCDC procedures required a grievance contain a detailed description of the\n\nincident, including the date and time of the occurrence, and the officers or inmates\n\ninvolved. Maldonado’s grievance concerning the August 8, 2011, incident did not\n\nidentify the date or time of the incident or the officers involved; it merely stated\n\nMaldonado “got beat & punish [sic] for a remote control that came apart & for not\n\ncleaning up.” R. at 1435. In addition, Maldonado wrote his complaint on an\n\ninmate-request form, instead of an inmate-grievance form, as the NCDC Inmate\n\nHandbook instructs. Accordingly, Maldonado’s grievance concerning the August\n\n8, 2011, incident did not comply with the NCDC grievance procedure, and the\n\n\n                                          27\n\f                Case: 15-10867   Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 28 of 37\n\n\njudge correctly dismissed that claim as unexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 218,\n\n127 S. Ct. at 922-23.\n\n      In contrast, Maldonado’s grievance concerning the December 23, 2010,\n\nincident largely complies with the NCDC procedural requirements. That grievance\n\nis written on an inmate-grievance form, identifies the date of the alleged incident,\n\nidentifies the officers involved, and provides a detailed account of the incident,\n\ngiven the space limitations on the form. Consequently, Maldonado properly\n\nexhausted his administrative remedies concerning the December 23, 2010,\n\nincident, and the judge erred in dismissing that claim for failure to exhaust. See\n\nJones, 549 U.S. at 218, 127 S. Ct. at 922-23.\n\nB.    Qualified Immunity\n\n      Maldonado also contends the judge erroneously placed the burden of\n\ndisproving the defendants’ entitlement to qualified immunity on him, when it was\n\nthe defendants’ burden to prove they were entitled to qualified immunity. He\n\nfurther asserts the judge erroneously applied a heightened standard of proof\n\nconcerning the clearly established law prong of the qualified-immunity defense.\n\nFinally, he argues the defendants waived their qualified-immunity defense, because\n\nthey did not plead or prove it properly; in any event, Maldonado presented\n\nevidence establishing a genuine issue of material fact regarding the availability of\n\nthat defense.\n\n\n                                          28\n\f             Case: 15-10867      Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 29 of 37\n\n\n      We review de novo a district judge’s disposition of a motion for summary\n\njudgment based on qualified immunity, resolve all issues of material fact in favor\n\nof the plaintiff, and determine whether the defendants are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity under that version of the facts.

Eslinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78223\"><a href=\"/opinion/78223/case-v-eslinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1324-\n\n25 (11th Cir. 2009). Qualified immunity shields government officials performing\n\ndiscretionary functions from liability under § 1983, as long as their conduct “does\n\nnot violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a\n\nreasonable person would have known.” Id. at 1325 (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). To invoke the defense of qualified immunity, a defendant must\n\nfirst establish he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority. Id.\n\nOnce the defendant has made this showing, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to\n\novercome the qualified-immunity defense by showing (1) the defendant violated\n\nhis constitutional rights, and (2) the right at issue was clearly established at the\n\ntime of the alleged misconduct. Terrell v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1244</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1250 (11th Cir.\n\n2012).\n\n      The qualified-immunity inquiry is context-specific; qualified immunity\n\napplies unless the plaintiff can show no reasonable officer in the defendant’s\n\nposition would have taken the same action. See id. To determine whether a\n\nreasonable officer would have known his conduct was unconstitutional, we ask\n\nwhether either (1) under the prevailing case law at the time, a concrete factual basis\n\n\n                                           29\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 30 of 37\n\n\nexisted so that it was obvious to a reasonable officer that his actions violated\n\nfederal law; or (2) the unlawfulness of the officer’s conduct was readily apparent in\n\nspite of the lack of fact-specific case law.

When officers punish an inmate for filing grievances\n\nconcerning the conditions of his confinement, they violate the inmate’s First\n\nAmendment rights to free speech and to petition the government for redress of\n\ngrievances. Boxer X v.

Douglas v.\n\nYates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"78066\"><a href=\"/opinion/78066/douglas-v-yates/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1321 (11th Cir. 2008). Once the plaintiff establishes his\n\nprotected conduct was a motivating factor behind the alleged harm, the burden\n\nshifts to the defendant to show it would have taken the same action absent the\n\nprotected activity. Smith v. Fla. Dep’t of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1063 (11th Cir.\n\n2013).\n\n      The judge did not err in placing the burden on Maldonado to overcome the\n\nqualified-immunity defense. Maldonado never disputed the defendants were\n\nacting under their discretionary authority; therefore, the burden was on him to\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 31 of 37\n\n\ndemonstrate the defendants violated his clearly established rights. See Terrell, 668\n\nF.3d at 1250.\n\n      The judge did not err in concluding the defendants were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity concerning the May 26, 2011, incident. Maldonado is correct the right\n\nof prison inmates to be free from retaliation for filing grievances concerning the\n\nconditions of their confinement is clearly established. Boxer X, 437 F.3d at 1112.\n\nBut he failed to show that Corporal Kennard had violated that right by pepper-\n\nspraying him on May 26, 2011. See Terrell, 668 F.3d at 1250. Maldonado\n\ncontended he was pepper-sprayed in retaliation for attempting to initiate a sexual\n\nharassment investigation against another officer. Yet, he testified Corporal\n\nKennard escorted him into his cell after he had refused to obey an order to lock\n\ndown, and, while inside the cell, “a few words [were] said,” and that was when\n\nCorporal Kennard pepper-sprayed him. R. at 1201. Consequently, under\n\nMaldonado’s own version of the facts, it is not clear Corporal Kennard pepper-\n\nsprayed Maldonado in retaliation for his attempt to file a grievance or to subdue\n\nhim and obtain his compliance with the officer’s orders. Maldonado therefore did\n\nnot show no reasonable officer would have taken the same action as Corporal\n\nKennard under the circumstance; consequently, qualified immunity applies. See\n\nTerrell, 668 F.3d at 1250.\n\n\n\n\n                                         31\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 32 of 37\n\n\n      In contrast is the December 23, 2010, incident as to entitlement to qualified\n\nimmunity. Maldonado’s account of the event alleges, after placing him in the\n\nrestraint chair and rendering him defenseless, Officers Ramsey and Maher\n\nthreatened Maldonado would regret bringing any lawsuits against them, then beat\n\nhim, broke his finger, and burned him with a lighter. Maldonado acknowledged he\n\nwas removed from his cell after jamming his cell door in violation of jail rules but\n\ncontended he did not physically resist the officers, and his injuries were sustained\n\nafter he was placed in the restraint chair, when officers would have no disciplinary\n\nreason for using force against him. Based on this account of the facts, Maldonado\n\nshowed Officers Ramsey and Maher violated his clearly established rights by\n\nretaliating against him for engaging in protected conduct. See Terrell, 668 F.3d at\n\n1250; Case, 555 F.3d at 1325; Boxer X, 437 F.3d at 1112. Therefore, the officers\n\nwere not entitled to summary judgment on this claim, based on qualified immunity;\n\nwe reverse the district judge’s granting summary judgment on this claim.\n\nC.    Nondispositive Motions\n\n      Maldonado asserts the district judge erred in denying his motions for\n\nappointment of counsel, an expert witness, permission to enter upon land, to\n\ncompel discovery, and to reinstate Counts II, III, and IV. He represents he was\n\nentitled to the relief sought in each of those motions, and the judge abused her\n\ndiscretion in denying them.\n\n\n                                         32\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 33 of 37\n\n\n      We review motions for appointment of counsel, discovery rulings, and\n\nmotions for reconsideration for abuse of discretion.

Although\n\nplaintiffs in civil cases have no constitutional right to counsel, district judges may\n\nappoint counsel for indigent plaintiffs under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1). Bass, 170\n\nF.3d at 1320. Counsel should be appointed only in exceptional circumstances; a\n\ndistrict judge has broad discretion in making that determination. Id. The fact a\n\nplaintiff would be helped by the assistance of an attorney does not, in itself, require\n\nappointment of counsel. Id.\n\n      We will not overturn discovery rulings unless they resulted in substantial\n\nharm to the appellant’s case. Josendis, 662 F.3d at 1307. District judges have\n\nbroad authority to control the scope of discovery and may deny a motion to compel\n\ndiscovery if the discovery sought is irrelevant. Fed. R. Civ.

Shah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720725\"><a href=\"/opinion/720725/william-s-steele-v-doctor-shah-mental-health-department-orange-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1271 (11th Cir. 1996). Appointment of an expert\n\nwitness may be appropriate, when it is necessary to ensure a just resolution of the\n\nclaim. Steele, 87 F.3d at 1271.\n\n      A party may move to alter or amend a judgment within 28 days after the\n\nentry of judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). A Rule 59(e) motion may be granted\n\nonly on the basis of newly discovered evidence or manifest errors of law or fact\n\nand may not be used to relitigate old matters or present additional arguments or\n\nevidence that could have been raised prior to the entry of judgment. Arthur, 500\n\nF.3d at 1343.\n\n      The judge did not abuse her discretion in denying any of the motions\n\nMaldonado seeks to appeal. She did not err in denying Maldonado’s motions for\n\nappointment of counsel, because Maldonado did not demonstrate an appointment\n\nwas warranted by exceptional circumstances. Bass, 170 F.3d at 1320. Maldonado\n\nrepeatedly asserted having an attorney would be helpful to him but that is true of\n\nmany pro se litigants and does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. See id.\n\nThe judge also did not abuse her discretion in denying Maldonado’s requests for\n\nappointment of an expert witness. Although a district judge has the authority to\n\nappoint an expert on a party’s motion, the judge is not required to do so. See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 706(a). Because Maldonado did not exhaust any claims concerning\n\n\n                                           34\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016    Page: 35 of 37\n\n\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, the appointment of medical\n\nexperts was not warranted, and the judge’s refusal to appoint such experts did not\n\nresult in substantial harm to his case. See Josendis, 662 F.3d at 1307; Steele, 87\n\nF.3d at 1271. Similarly, the judge’s refusal to appoint a taser expert did not result\n\nin substantial harm to Maldonado’s case, because his claim concerning the July 12,\n\n2010, taser incident was unexhausted; therefore, his requested expert was\n\nunnecessary. See Josendis, 662 F.3d at 1307; Steele, 87 F.3d at 1271.\n\n      In addition, the judge did not abuse her discretion in denying Maldonado’s\n\nmotions for entry upon land and to compel discovery. She properly concluded it\n\nwould be inappropriate to grant Maldonado’s motion for entry upon land. The\n\nburden of allowing Maldonado, who by then was incarcerated in another facility\n\npursuant to his capital sentence, to inspect and photograph the NCDC would have\n\noutweighed the possible benefit of that discovery, because it did not relate to the\n\ncentral issues in his complaint. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1). Maldonado’s motion\n\nto compel largely contains broad requests for information about incidents\n\ninvolving other inmates, which were not relevant to his individual retaliation and\n\ndeliberate-indifference claims. Furthermore, Maldonado acknowledged in his\n\nmotion the defendants had produced or were attempting to locate documents\n\nresponsive to his request. Therefore, the judge did not commit a clear error of\n\n\n\n\n                                          35\n\f             Case: 15-10867    Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 36 of 37\n\n\njudgment in denying his motion. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b); Josendis, 662 F.3d at\n\n1307; Sanderlin, 243 F.3d at 1293.\n\n      Finally, the judge did not err in denying Maldonado’s motion for\n\nreconsideration seeking the reinstatement of Counts II, III, and IV. As the judge\n\nnoted, Maldonado’s motion was filed more than 28 days after her order dismissing\n\nthose counts; therefore, it was untimely. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e). Furthermore,\n\nhis motion did not rely on newly discovered evidence or demonstrate any manifest\n\nerrors of law or fact in the judge’s screening order. Arthur, 500 F.3d at 1343.\n\nInstead, Maldonado contended he could have drafted a better complaint if his\n\naccess to the prison law library had not been hindered and erroneously asserted the\n\njudge had dismissed the relevant counts on qualified-immunity grounds.\n\nConsequently, Maldonado did not show reconsideration was warranted, and the\n\njudge’s denial of his motion was not an abuse of discretion. See Arthur, 500 F.3d\n\nat 1343.\n\n                               III. CONCLUSION\n\n      As we have explained, we vacate and remand granting of summary\n\njudgment in part, regarding the December 23, 2010, retaliation claim but affirm\n\ngranting summary judgment regarding Maldonado’s deliberate indifference and\n\nother retaliation claims. We also affirm the district judge’s denial of Maldonado’s\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\f             Case: 15-10867     Date Filed: 04/26/2016   Page: 37 of 37\n\n\nrequests for appointment of counsel, appointment of an expert witness, permission\n\nto enter upon land, to compel discovery, and to reinstate Counts II, III, and IV.\n\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         37\n\f</pre>",
