We will affirm.\n\n                                            I.\n\n      The Dumont school district, which covers less than two square miles in northern\n\nNew Jersey, contains four public elementary schools: Grant School, Honiss School,\n\nLincoln School, and Selzer School. Since 2008-2009, the school district has offered one\n\n                                            2\n\fkindergarten “inclusion class,” composed both of students who need special education\n\nand those who do not, under New Jersey regulations implementing IDEA. See N.J.\n\nAdmin. Code § 6A:14-4.6(i). In the inclusion class, all students are taught the general\n\neducation curriculum. See id. (“The primary instructional responsibility for the student in\n\nan [inclusion class] shall be the general education teacher unless otherwise specified in\n\nthe student’s IEP [i.e., individualized education program].”). The students who need\n\nspecial education participate in an in-class resource program, which consists of individual\n\ninstruction and support from an in-class special education teacher. See id. (“In an in-class\n\nresource program, the student shall be provided modifications to the instructional\n\nstrategies or testing procedures or other specialized instruction to access the general\n\neducation curriculum in accordance with the student’s IEP. . . . An in-class resource\n\nprogram shall be provided in the student’s general education class at the same time as the\n\nrest of the class.”).\n\n       In 2008-2009, the inclusion class was held at Lincoln School and contained four of\n\nthe school district’s eight kindergartners with special education needs and twelve\n\nkindergartners without such needs. In 2009-2010, the inclusion class was held at Grant\n\nSchool and contained four of the school district’s seventeen kindergartners with special\n\neducation needs and thirteen kindergartners without such needs. In 2010-2011, the class,\n\nagain held at Grant School, contained one of the school district’s eight kindergartners\n\nwith special education needs and sixteen kindergartners without such needs. New Jersey\n\nregulations allow inclusion classes to contain as many as eight students with special\n\neducation needs. Id. § 6A:14-4.6(n). The other kindergartners with special education\n\n                                              3\n\fneeds were placed in self-contained classrooms 1 in or out of the school district or in\n\nregular classrooms, depending on their individual educational needs.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       J.T. is the mother of A.T., an autistic boy. In 2008-2009, A.T. spent part of the\n\nschool day in a preschool inclusion class at his local neighborhood school, Selzer School,\n\nwhich is located less than a half-mile from his home, and the rest of the school day in an\n\nout-of-school district self-contained classroom.\n\n       On May 21, 2009, the child study team, 2 J.T., and Dr. Paul Barbato, who is the\n\nDumont school district’s Director of Special Services, convened to prepare an IEP for\n\nA.T.’s kindergarten year, as stipulated under IDEA. The child study team first considered\n\neducating A.T. at Selzer School, with or without supplemental aids and services, but after\n\nfurther evaluation, including discussion with J.T., decided this option would not meet\n\nA.T.’s individual educational needs. The child study team then determined that placing\n\nA.T. in the kindergarten inclusion class would best meet his needs. As noted, in the 2009-\n\n2010 school year, the only kindergarten inclusion class in the two-square-mile school\n\ndistrict was located at Grant School. The child study team addressed J.T.’s questions\n\n\n1\n  “Unlike inclusion classrooms, self-contained classrooms educate only special needs\nchildren.” D.F. v. Collingswood Borough Bd. of Educ., 694 F.3d 488, 491 n.2 (3d Cir.\n2012).\n2\n  Under New Jersey regulation, a child study team, which includes a school psychologist,\na learning disabilities teacher-consultant, and a school social worker, along with\nspecialists in the area of disabilities, school personnel, and parents are “responsible for\nidentification, evaluation, determination of eligibility, development and review of the\nindividualized education program, and placement.” N.J. Admin. Code § 6A:14-3.1(a).\nSee S.H. v. State-Operated Sch. Dist. of City of Newark, 336 F.3d 260, 264-65 (3d Cir.\n2003) (explaining that this regulation implements IDEA).\n                                              4\n\fabout the inclusion class, explaining that the integrated services, small class size, and in-\n\nclass special education teacher were important to enable A.T. to retain and generalize\n\ninformation, and further that his placement in the class would be with the expectation that\n\nhe would transition back to Selzer School for first grade. The child study team also made\n\nclear that the general education curriculum taught to all students in the inclusion class\n\nwould be the same as in a regular kindergarten class.\n\n       On June 26, 2009, J.T. filed a due process petition with the New Jersey\n\nDepartment of Education objecting to A.T.’s placement in the inclusion class because it\n\nwas not a general education class and was not located at A.T.’s nearest school (Selzer\n\nSchool). J.T. also contended the Dumont school district had determined A.T.’s placement\n\nbased on an alleged general rule that no student with special education needs would be\n\nplaced at Selzer School. The petition was transferred to the Office of Administrative\n\nLaw.\n\n       During the spring and summer of 2009, J.T. continued to communicate with Dr.\n\nBarbato about A.T.’s kindergarten placement. On August 21, 2009, J.T. wrote to Dr.\n\nBarbato by email: “I do want to withdraw [A.T.]’s petition. I think [A.T.] belongs in [a]\n\ngeneral ed[ucation class], but I am satisfied with revising the modifications and related\n\nservices and I believe that you feel good about the [inclusion class] program and\n\nplacement at Grant.” In September 2009, J.T. expressed some misgivings about A.T.’s\n\nplacement in the inclusion class because she wished to have C.T., A.T.’s sibling, placed\n\nin the inclusion class but also desired to keep the siblings in separate classes, and again\n\nrequested A.T.’s placement at Selzer School. Later that month, Dr. Barbato offered to\n\n                                              5\n\fplace A.T. in a regular class at Selzer School multiple times, but J.T. did not accept the\n\noffers. A.T. was placed in the kindergarten inclusion class at Grant School, located less\n\nthan two miles from his home.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       On September 28, 2009, J.T. filed a class action complaint under IDEA and § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act. 3 On November 17, 2009, J.T. withdrew her due process\n\npetition. On April 16, 2010, J.T. filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, on behalf of\n\nall kindergartners (and their parents or caregivers) who reside in the town of Dumont and\n\nrequire special education services, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, including a\n\nproposed declaration that defendants “consider placing each kindergartner who requires\n\nspecial education services in regular classrooms in the school they would otherwise\n\nattend if not requiring special education services,” and a proposed order that defendants\n\n“educate Class members, wherever possible, in regular classrooms,” meaning classrooms\n\n“that reflect[] the natural proportion” in the district of children requiring special\n\neducation and those who do not and “are located in the [Class members’] neighborhood\n\nschool.” Meanwhile, A.T. made significant progress in the kindergarten inclusion class at\n\nGrant School, where he stayed throughout his kindergarten year, and returned to Selzer\n\nSchool for first grade.\n\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment, contending plaintiffs did not have\n\nstanding because they failed to allege a legally cognizable injury and, alternatively, failed\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fto exhaust their IDEA administrative remedies. The District Court granted summary\n\njudgment on both grounds. It found plaintiffs’ allegation of a purely procedural violation\n\nfailed to provide standing under IDEA or the Rehabilitation Act, and to the extent\n\nplaintiffs alleged a substantive violation, they failed to exhaust their IDEA administrative\n\nremedies before bringing their claim in federal court. Plaintiffs appeal, contending they\n\nallege actionable harm under IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act and requesting excusal\n\nfrom their failure to exhaust IDEA administrative remedies.\n\n                                             II.4\n\n       The standing requirement of Article III of the United States Constitution is\n\n“immutable” and “the irreducible constitutional minimum” for us to have jurisdiction\n\nover a case or controversy. Fair Hous. Council of Suburban Phila. v. Montgomery\n\nNewspapers, 141 F.3d 71, 74 (3d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[I]f\n\nnone of the named plaintiffs purporting to represent a class establishes” standing, “none\n\nmay seek relief on behalf of himself or any other member of the class.” O’Shea v.\n\nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974).\n\n       [T]o satisfy Article III’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has\n       suffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or\n       imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the\n       challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely\n       speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n\n3\n  Plaintiffs also claimed a violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. The\nDistrict Court dismissed the claim without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction. Plaintiffs\nbrought that claim in state court and do not appeal its dismissal.\n4\n  The District Court had jurisdiction under 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3) and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331\nand 1343. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We exercise plenary review over\nall jurisdictional questions, including whether a plaintiff has standing, and over a grant of\nsummary judgment. Biener v. Calio, 361 F.3d 206, 210 (3d Cir. 2004).\n                                              7\n\fFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81\n\n(2000). “The actual or threatened injury required by Art. III may exist solely by virtue of\n\nstatutes creating legal rights, the invasion of which creates standing.” Warth v. Seldin,\n\n422 U.S. 490, 500 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Raines v. Byrd, 521\n\nU.S. 811, 819 (1997) (“[T]he alleged injury must be legally and judicially cognizable.”).\n\nAccordingly, we look to the statutes under which J.T. claims harm to determine if she has\n\nstanding to bring this putative class action.\n\n       IDEA provides:\n\n       (i) In general\n       Subject to clause (ii), a decision made by a hearing officer shall be made on\n       substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free\n       appropriate public education.\n       (ii) Procedural issues\n       In matters alleging a procedural violation, a hearing officer may find that a child\n       did not receive a free appropriate public education only if the procedural\n       inadequacies--\n               (I) impeded the child’s right to a free appropriate public education;\n               (II) significantly impeded the parents’ opportunity to participate in the\n               decisionmaking process regarding the provision of a free appropriate public\n               education to the parents’ child; or\n               (III) caused a deprivation of educational benefits.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(f)(3)(E) (emphasis added). That is, “a school district’s failure to\n\ncomply with the procedural requirements of the Act will constitute a denial of a [free\n\nappropriate public education] only if such violation causes substantive harm to the child\n\nor his parents.” C.H. v. Cape Henlopen Sch. Dist., 606 F.3d 59, 66 (3d Cir. 2010)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); accord D.K. v. Abington Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 233, 249\n\n(3d Cir. 2012); Ridley Sch. Dist. v. M.R., 680 F.3d 260, 274 (3d Cir. 2012); D.S. v.\n\n\n                                                8\n\fBayonne Bd. of Educ., 602 F.3d 553, 565 (3d Cir. 2010) (“A procedural violation is\n\nactionable under the IDEA only if it results in a loss of educational opportunity for the\n\nstudent, seriously deprives parents of their participation rights, or causes a deprivation of\n\neducational benefits.”).\n\n       Nonetheless, plaintiffs contend purely procedural violations are actionable under\n\nIDEA. Plaintiffs are plainly incorrect, as IDEA makes procedural violations actionable\n\n“only if” the requirements of subsection (I), (II), or (III) are met. See D.S., 602 F.3d at\n\n565 (“[T]hough it is important that a school district comply with the IDEA’s procedural\n\nrequirements, rather than being a goal in itself, such compliance primarily is significant\n\nbecause of the requirements’ impact on students’ and parents’ substantive rights.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs concede they suffered no substantive harm: “Plaintiffs do not allege that\n\nA.T. was injured because he attended the Inclusion Kindergarten, and Plaintiffs do not\n\nseek relief in the form of a particular placement for any individual student.” Reply Br. at\n\n11 (footnote call number omitted). Plaintiffs concede IDEA permits schools to provide\n\nspecial education services in a centralized location. Id. at 18. Before the District Court,\n\nplaintiffs similarly conceded they suffered no substantive harm. In their opposition to\n\nsummary judgment, they stated “the substantive adequacy of Dumont’s kindergarten\n\nplacement decisions – whether Dumont in fact provided a [free appropriate public\n\neducation] . . . or provided it in the least restrictive environment . . . as to any specific\n\nkindergarten student (even A.T.), is not relevant to this action.” J.T. v. Dumont Public\n\nSch., No. 09-4969, 2012 WL 1044556, at *9 (D.N.J. Mar. 28, 2012) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). At oral argument before the District Court, plaintiffs stated their “claims\n\n                                                9\n\fare not based on any . . . allegations of individual harms,” they were “not alleging A.T.\n\nhas suffered an individual denial of an educational benefit,” and “for the purposes of\n\nstanding, their only personal grievance is a process grievance.” Id. at *3 n.6 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). As purely procedural claims are not actionable under IDEA,\n\nthe District Court was correct to find plaintiffs lacked standing.\n\n                                             III.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       Assuming plaintiffs had standing, summary judgment would be proper because\n\nthey failed to set forth any facts showing they were harmed – procedurally or\n\nsubstantively – under IDEA. See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986)\n\n(“[T]he burden on the moving party [for summary judgment] may be discharged by\n\n‘showing’ – that is, pointing out to the district court – that there is an absence of evidence\n\nto support the nonmoving party’s case.”).\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that the school district has failed to individually consider\n\neducational placements for kindergartners in need of special education and instead has\n\nimplemented a “blanket rule” placing them in an inclusion class without consideration of\n\neducating them in their “neighborhood” school (that is, the school closest to their home).\n\nPlaintiffs rely on Polk v. Central Susquehanna Intermediate Unit 16, 853 F.2d 171 (3d\n\nCir. 1988) for the proposition that it is an IDEA procedural violation for a school district\n\nto “determin[e] educational placements according to ‘blanket rules.’” In Polk, plaintiffs\n\ncontended defendants failed “to provide direct (‘hands on’) physical therapy from a\n\nlicensed physical therapist to any of the children” in question whose IEPs called for\n\n                                              10\n\fphysical therapy. Id. at 175. We found there was evidence “that none of the 65 children in\n\n[question] whose IEPs call for physical therapy actually receive direct physical therapy,”\n\nso there was a genuine issue of material fact whether defendants had refused, as a blanket\n\nrule, to provide individualized educational programs to those children. Id. at 172, 176.\n\n       As the District Court here found, “Polk is distinguishable from this case, given\n\nthat Polk plainly involved the deprivation of an educational benefit,” namely hands-on\n\nphysical therapy. J.T., 2012 WL 1044556 at *8. While Polk cast the violation alleged as\n\nprocedural, this violation “result[ed] in a loss of educational opportunity.” D.S., 602 F.3d\n\nat 565. Accordingly, the District Court here was correct to find Polk is consistent with\n\nour precedent explicitly stating a procedural violation is actionable only if it results in\n\nsubstantive harm. See, e.g., id; C.H., 606 F.3d at 66.\n\n       Plaintiffs also rely on Dr. Barbato’s deposition testimony. Dr. Barbato testified:\n\n       [T]he IEP team would consider the educational placement for every student on an\n       individual basis. . . . I believe the child study team offered a program, and the\n       program is housed at Grant School. I believe they did consider the home school of\n       Selzer, however, the program that was offered or proposed, rather, was provided at\n       Grant School. So . . . I believe the home school was considered, however, the\n       needs of the student in terms of program and services outweighed . . . attending the\n       home school.\n\nAfter making clear he wanted only a “yes” or “no” response, plaintiffs’ counsel asked Dr.\n\nBarbato “once the IEP team determined that student 33 required RP ICR [i.e., placement\n\nin the kindergarten inclusion class], did it have the authority to provide it at Selzer in the\n\n2009/2010 year?” Dr. Barbato responded “No.” Plaintiffs’ counsel then asked the same\n\nquestion for other 2009-2010 kindergartners and received the same response. Plaintiffs\n\nmisconstrue this testimony as evidence of a blanket rule. But Dr. Barbato’s testimony\n\n                                              11\n\fpoints out that once an IEP team considered a student’s individual educational needs and\n\ndetermined those needs would be met best by placing the student in the inclusion class,\n\nthe only available location in 2009-2010 was the inclusion class at Grant School.\n\n       Furthermore, only a few of the kindergartners in Dumont school district who\n\nrequired special education services were placed in the inclusion class each year: in 2008-\n\n2009, four of the eight such kindergartners were placed in the class; in 2009-2010, four of\n\nthe seventeen such kindergartners were placed in the class; and in 2010-2011, only one of\n\nthe eight such kindergartners was placed in the class.\n\n       Plaintiffs do not allege any other violations of IDEA, such as failure to\n\nindividually consider A.T.’s educational needs when developing his IEP or hindering\n\nJ.T.’s participation in the IEP process, nor would they have had a basis for such an\n\nallegation. As the District Court found:\n\n       In this case, the Plaintiffs allege the existence of a rigid rule, but there is no denial\n       of services, opportunities, participation, or benefits. The IEP team determined that\n       A.T. needed the support of an in-class special education teacher, and Dumont\n       provided one in the inclusion class. No evidence suggests that the placement of\n       A.T., or any other student in the inclusion class, was inappropriate or that the\n       placement decision was made without considering A.T.’s individual needs. In\n       addition, J.T. had discussions with Dumont about A.T.’s IEP prior to the IEP\n       meeting, and during the meeting, J.T. had the opportunity to discuss her concerns.\n\nJ.T., 2012 WL 1044556, at *9. “Undisputedly, Dumont has, through the IEP process,\n\nindividually determined that certain kindergartners need particular special education\n\nservices, and provided these services in a classroom with other kindergarteners who need\n\nno such services.” Id. We agree.\n\n                                              B.\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       As discussed, plaintiffs concede they suffered no substantive harm. The District\n\nCourt explained: “Plaintiffs cast the violations as procedural. To the extent Plaintiffs\n\nalleged substantive violations, they abandoned that theory, perhaps recognizing that they\n\nwould be required to exhaust their administrative remedies before seeking relief in this\n\nCourt” and that they had withdrawn their due process petition. Id. at *7 n.8 (citation\n\nomitted).\n\n       Furthermore, as noted, the record reveals no basis for alleging a substantive\n\nviolation. After filing her due process petition, J.T. could have sought stay-put relief, an\n\nIDEA requirement to keep students at their current educational placements pending the\n\noutcome of administrative proceedings. 20 U.S.C. § 1415(j); Drinker by Drinker v.\n\nColonial Sch. Dist., 78 F.3d 859, 864 (3d Cir. 1996) (“The provision represents\n\nCongress’ policy choice that all handicapped children, regardless of whether their case is\n\nmeritorious or not, are to remain in their current educational placement until the dispute\n\nwith regard to their placement is ultimately resolved.”). But she failed to do so. At the\n\ntime J.T.’s due process petition was pending but before she filed her class action\n\ncomplaint, Dr. Barbato offered to place A.T. in a regular class at Selzer School multiple\n\ntimes. J.T. did not accept those offers. Moreover, A.T.’s placement in the inclusion class\n\nachieved its intended goals: A.T. made significant educational progress during\n\nkindergarten and returned to Selzer School for first grade.\n\n       Finally, as noted, plaintiffs concede IDEA permits schools to provide special\n\neducation services in a centralized location, as opposed to in each student’s neighborhood\n\nschool. See White ex rel. White v. Ascension Parish Sch. Bd., 343 F.3d 373, 381 (5th Cir.\n\n                                             13\n\f2003) (“All of our sister circuits that have addressed the issue agree that, for provision of\n\nservices to an IDEA student, a school system may designate a school other than a\n\nneighborhood school. Restated, no federal appellate court has recognized a right to a\n\nneighborhood school assignment under the IDEA.”) (citing First, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth,\n\nNinth, and Tenth Circuit decisions in accord).5\n\n       Accordingly, the District Court here properly granted summary judgment on\n\nplaintiffs’ IDEA claim.\n\n                                               IV.\n\n       Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides: “No otherwise qualified individual\n\nwith a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be\n\nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to\n\ndiscrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance . . . .”\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794(a). “[M]ore than one court in this Circuit has held that, when . . .\n\n\n5\n  While a school district must take into account geographical proximity of placement, it is\nnot obligated to place students in their neighborhood schools. Oberti by Oberti v. Bd. of\nEduc. of Borough of Clementon Sch. Dist., 995 F.2d 1204, 1224 n.31 (3d Cir. 1993)\n(citing Barnett v. Fairfax Cnty. Sch. Bd., 927 F.2d 146, 153 (4th Cir. 1991)). IDEA’s key\nrequirement is providing students with special needs a “‘free appropriate public education\n. . . specially designed to meet the unique needs of the handicapped child.’” Id. at 1213\n(quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 188-89). Accordingly, a “child is [to be] educated in the\nschool he would attend if not disabled unless the IEP requires some other arrangement.”\nWhite, 343 F.3d at 380; accord Murray By & Through Murray v. Montrose Cnty. Sch.\nDist. RE-1J, 51 F.3d 921, 929 (10th Cir. 1995) (“[A] disabled child should be educated in\nthe school he or she would attend if not disabled (i.e., the neighborhood school), unless\nthe child’s IEP requires placement elsewhere.”). Similarly, New Jersey regulation\nspecifies: “When determining the restrictiveness of a particular program option, such\ndeterminations are based solely on the amount of time a student with disabilities is\neducated outside the general education setting.” N.J. Admin. Code § 6A:14-4.2(a)(11)\n(emphasis added).\n                                               14\n\f[Rehabilitation Act] claims are based on violations of the IDEA, the . . . [Rehabilitation\n\nAct] claims are derivative of the IDEA claims.” N.P. v. E. Orange Bd. of Educ., No. 06-\n\n5130, 2011 WL 463037, at *10 (D.N.J. Feb. 3, 2011); accord W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d\n\n484, 492-93 (3d Cir. 1995) (overruled on other grounds by A.W. v. Jersey City Pub. Sch.,\n\n486 F.3d 791, 799 (3d Cir. 2007)) (“There appear to be few differences, if any, between\n\nIDEA’s affirmative duty and § 504’s negative prohibition.”). Plaintiffs do not dispute\n\nthey would not have standing under the Rehabilitation Act if they contended they\n\nsuffered the same harm as they contend they suffered under IDEA. But plaintiffs\n\nmaintain they suffered an additional injury under the Rehabilitation Act: they were\n\n“bus[ed] . . . out of their neighborhood” for the kindergarten year to attend an inclusion\n\nclass “in the basement, while all the regular kindergarten classes are located in the upper\n\nlevels of the school,” so they were “involuntarily mark[ed] . . . as disabled in the eyes of\n\ntheir peers.” Plaintiffs waived this contention by not raising it before the District Court.\n\nD.L. v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 497, 596 F.3d 768, 773-74 (10th Cir. 2010) (“Plaintiffs\n\nnever argued (until their brief in this appeal) that the . . . Rehabilitation Act claims had\n\nany other basis. . . . Having only pursued a theory for recovery under the . . .\n\nRehabilitation Act based on [one issue], Plaintiffs may not now seek to broaden their\n\ntheory.”). Accordingly, the District Court properly granted summary judgment on\n\nplaintiffs’ Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n       Even if not waived, we would affirm. Plaintiffs rely on Doe v. National Board of\n\nMedical Examiners for the proposition that being identified as disabled against one’s will\n\nis an injury. 199 F.3d 146, 153 (3d Cir. 1999). In Doe, the plaintiff had standing under\n\n                                              15\n\fthe Americans with Disabilities Act because he was identified as disabled on his test\n\nscores after “he ha[d] actively sought to avoid being so identified.” Id. In contrast, IDEA\n\nrequires school districts to identify students in need in order to provide them special\n\neducation services. Schaffer ex rel. Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 53 (2005). Busing\n\nstudents to a centralized location for special services may be integral to IDEA\n\ncompliance and, depending on the IEP, is sought by many parents of children with\n\nspecial needs.\n\n       Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiffs were educated apart from other\n\nchildren within Grant School. Within the inclusion class, the large majority of students\n\neach year did not need special education, so placement in the class would not have\n\nmarked a student as with “special needs.” In 2008-2009, the inclusion class contained\n\nfour kindergartners with special needs and twelve without; in 2009-2010, it contained\n\nfour kindergartners with special needs and thirteen without; in 2010-2011, it contained\n\nonly one kindergartner with special needs and sixteen without. Nor is the inclusion class\n\nsegregated from other classes. An educational consultant found “the kindergarten is\n\nlocated on a floor with other typical classes and is not isolated in any manner. . . . The\n\n[inclusion class] is a typical kindergarten and has the same physical and social access to\n\nthe school as any kindergarten class would.” A paraprofessional who worked in the\n\ninclusion class testified the other classes on the same floor as the inclusion class were an\n\nart class, a music class, a speech class, an enrichment class, and a self-contained class.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       IDEA “establishes an elaborate procedural mechanism to protect the rights of”\n\n                                             16\n\fspecial needs children, including “the right to a due process hearing before an\n\nadministrative official.” Komninos by Komninos v. Upper Saddle River Bd. of Educ., 13\n\nF.3d 775, 778 (3d Cir. 1994). “Parties aggrieved by the findings and decision made in the\n\nadministrative proceedings provided by the Act have the right to bring a civil action in\n\neither federal or state court.” Id. (citing what is now 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A)). IDEA\n\n“thus grants subject matter jurisdiction to the district courts. However, it is clear from the\n\nlanguage of the Act that Congress intended plaintiffs to complete the administrative\n\nprocess before resorting to federal court.” Id. Exhaustion of the IDEA administrative\n\nprocess is also required, “to the same extent as would be required had the action been\n\nbrought under” IDEA, before filing a civil action under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act,\n\n29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq., “seeking relief that is also available under” IDEA. 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1415(l).6\n\n       Plaintiffs concede they failed to exhaust their IDEA administrative remedies\n\nbefore bringing their putative class action in federal court. There is a strong policy of\n\nrequiring exhaustion. Komninos, 13 F.3d at 778.\n\n       This exhaustion rule serves a number of important purposes, including (1)\n       permitting the exercise of agency discretion and expertise on issues requiring these\n       characteristics; (2) allowing the full development of technical issues and a factual\n       record prior to court review; (3) preventing deliberate disregard and circumvention\n       of agency procedures established by Congress; and (4) avoiding unnecessary\n       judicial decisions by giving the agency the first opportunity to correct any error.\n\n\n6\n  In addressing this issue, plaintiffs contend they seek relief under the Rehabilitation Act\nthat is not available under IDEA: the school district’s consideration of whether providing\nspecial education services in students’ local schools would be unduly burdensome. As\nplaintiffs did not raise this contention before the District Court, it is waived. D.L., 596\nF.3d at 773-74.\n                                              17\n\fHayes Through Hayes v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 377, 877 F.2d 809, 814 (10th Cir. 1989)\n\n(quoting Ass’n for Retarded Citizens, Inc. v. Teague, 830 F.2d 158, 160 (11th Cir. 1987)).\n\nWe may excuse failure to exhaust only “(1) where exhaustion would be futile or\n\ninadequate; (2) where the issue presented is purely a legal question; (3) where the\n\nadministrative agency cannot grant relief; and (4) when exhaustion would work severe or\n\nirreparable harm upon a litigant.” Beth V. by Yvonne V. v. Carroll, 87 F.3d 80, 88-89 (3d\n\nCir. 1995) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The party seeking relief from\n\nexhaustion bears the burden of proof. Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 327 (1988).\n\n       Plaintiffs contend their failure to exhaust should be excused because “claims in the\n\nOAL routinely take many months, or an average of 190 days, to come to resolution,” so it\n\nis unlikely any administrative relief would aid plaintiffs, whose claims are limited to the\n\nkindergarten year. Plaintiffs provided no expert testimony explaining their calculations.\n\nNew Jersey, in fact, has “relatively tight time frames for administrative decision making.”\n\nGrieco v. New Jersey Dep’t of Educ., No. 06-cv-4077, 2007 WL 1876498, at *7 (D.N.J.\n\nJune 27, 2007). Even if plaintiffs had an “unsatisfactory experience with the\n\nadministrative process, . . . it would be mere speculation for us to conclude that the\n\nadministrative process would fail each of the other individually named plaintiffs.” Blunt\n\nv. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 559 F. Supp. 2d 548, 558 (E.D. Pa. 2008). Moreover, as\n\ndiscussed, plaintiffs never sought stay-put relief, which would have kept A.T. at Selzer\n\nSchool pending the completion of the administrative process.\n\n       Plaintiffs also contend the OAL cannot provide class-wide discovery and grant the\n\nclass-wide declaratory and injunctive relief they seek. Exhaustion may be excused when\n\n                                             18\n\fplaintiffs “allege systemic legal deficiencies and, correspondingly, request system-wide\n\nrelief that cannot be provided (or even addressed) through the administrative process.”\n\nBeth V., 87 F.3d at 89. “[A] claim is ‘systemic’ if it implicates the integrity or reliability\n\nof the IDEA dispute resolution procedures themselves, or requires restructuring the\n\neducation system itself in order to comply with the dictates of the Act.” Doe By and\n\nThrough Brockhuis v. Ariz. Dep’t of Educ., 111 F.3d 678, 682 (9th Cir. 1997). A claim\n\n“is not ‘systemic’ if it involves only a substantive claim having to do with limited\n\ncomponents of a program, and if the administrative process is capable of correcting the\n\nproblem.” Id.\n\n       “[F]raming a complaint as a class action challenge to a general policy does not\n\nautomatically convert the case into the kind of systemic violation that renders the\n\nexhaustion requirement inadequate or futile.” Grieco, 2007 WL 1876498, at *9; accord\n\nAss’n for Cmty. Living in Colo. v. Romer, 992 F.2d 1040, 1044 (10th Cir. 1993); Mrs. M\n\nv. Bridgeport Bd. of Educ., 96 F. Supp. 2d 124, 135 (D. Conn. 2000). Accordingly, the\n\nprocedure through which the school district placed A.T. in the inclusion class is not\n\nrendered a systemic issue simply because J.T. raises it in a putative class action.\n\n       In Romer, the Tenth Circuit addressed a claim similar to that here: that a\n\ndepartment of education had denied a class of children “appropriately individualized IEPs\n\nbecause its policies arbitrarily predetermine the duration of [extended school day] and\n\n[extended school year] services and use a single criterion to determine eligibility for\n\n[extended school year] services.” 992 F.2d at 1043. The plaintiffs failed to exhaust their\n\nIDEA administrative remedies before bringing their class action. Id. The court held the\n\n                                              19\n\fexceptions to the exhaustion requirement were not met because “[t]he violations alleged\n\nand relief requested in this case . . . target . . . the effect of a single component of [the\n\ndepartment of education]’s educational program on individual children’s IEPs.” Id. at\n\n1044. “The determination of whether [the department of education]’s policies have\n\ndenied children with disabilities appropriately individualized IEPs entails a factually\n\nintensive inquiry into the circumstances of each individual child’s case. This is precisely\n\nthe kind of issue the IDEA’s administrative process was designed to address.” Id.\n\n       Similarly, plaintiffs here claim Dumont school district failed to individually\n\nconsider their educational placements. This claim addresses only one component of the\n\nschool district’s educational program, which, as the District Court found, “is limited to a\n\nsmall subset of [special needs] students in Dumont, at only one grade level –\n\nkindergarten.” J.T., 2012 WL 1044556 at *10. Resolving this claim entails “a factually\n\nintensive inquiry into the circumstances of each individual child’s case.” Romer, 992\n\nF.2d at 1044. Accordingly, there is no reason to excuse plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust the\n\nIDEA administrative process, which was designed to address “precisely th[is] kind of\n\nissue.” Id.\n\n                                              VI.7\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment and discovery order.\n\n\n7\n During discovery, the District Court ordered the parties to split the cost of creating\nmirror images of the computer hard drives of two school district administrative\npersonnel. We review discovery orders for abuse of discretion. Petrucelli v. Bohringer &\nRatzinger, 46 F.3d 1298, 1310 (3d Cir. 1995). We see no abuse of discretion here.\n                                               20\n\f",

We will affirm.\n\n                                            I.\n\n      The Dumont school district, which covers less than two square miles in northern\n\nNew Jersey, contains four public elementary schools: Grant School, Honiss School,\n\nLincoln School, and Selzer School. Since 2008-2009, the school district has offered one\n\n                                            2\n\fkindergarten “inclusion class,” composed both of students who need special education\n\nand those who do not, under New Jersey regulations implementing IDEA. See N.J.\n\nAdmin. Code § 6A:14-4.6(i). In the inclusion class, all students are taught the general\n\neducation curriculum. See id. (“The primary instructional responsibility for the student in\n\nan [inclusion class] shall be the general education teacher unless otherwise specified in\n\nthe student’s IEP [i.e., individualized education program].”). The students who need\n\nspecial education participate in an in-class resource program, which consists of individual\n\ninstruction and support from an in-class special education teacher. See id. (“In an in-class\n\nresource program, the student shall be provided modifications to the instructional\n\nstrategies or testing procedures or other specialized instruction to access the general\n\neducation curriculum in accordance with the student’s IEP. . . .

In 2009-2010, the inclusion class was held at Grant\n\nSchool and contained four of the school district’s seventeen kindergartners with special\n\neducation needs and thirteen kindergartners without such needs. In 2010-2011, the class,\n\nagain held at Grant School, contained one of the school district’s eight kindergartners\n\nwith special education needs and sixteen kindergartners without such needs. New Jersey\n\nregulations allow inclusion classes to contain as many as eight students with special\n\neducation needs. Id. § 6A:14-4.6(n). The other kindergartners with special education\n\n                                              3\n\fneeds were placed in self-contained classrooms 1 in or out of the school district or in\n\nregular classrooms, depending on their individual educational needs.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       J.T. is the mother of A.T., an autistic boy. In 2008-2009, A.T. spent part of the\n\nschool day in a preschool inclusion class at his local neighborhood school, Selzer School,\n\nwhich is located less than a half-mile from his home, and the rest of the school day in an\n\nout-of-school district self-contained classroom.\n\n       On May 21, 2009, the child study team, 2 J.T., and Dr. Paul Barbato, who is the\n\nDumont school district’s Director of Special Services, convened to prepare an IEP for\n\nA.T.’s kindergarten year, as stipulated under IDEA. The child study team first considered\n\neducating A.T. at Selzer School, with or without supplemental aids and services, but after\n\nfurther evaluation, including discussion with J.T., decided this option would not meet\n\nA.T.’s individual educational needs. The child study team then determined that placing\n\nA.T. in the kindergarten inclusion class would best meet his needs. As noted, in the 2009-\n\n2010 school year, the only kindergarten inclusion class in the two-square-mile school\n\ndistrict was located at Grant School. The child study team addressed J.T.’s questions\n\n\n1\n  “Unlike inclusion classrooms, self-contained classrooms educate only special needs\nchildren.” D.F. v.

The child study team also made\n\nclear that the general education curriculum taught to all students in the inclusion class\n\nwould be the same as in a regular kindergarten class.\n\n       On June 26, 2009, J.T. filed a due process petition with the New Jersey\n\nDepartment of Education objecting to A.T.’s placement in the inclusion class because it\n\nwas not a general education class and was not located at A.T.’s nearest school (Selzer\n\nSchool). J.T. also contended the Dumont school district had determined A.T.’s placement\n\nbased on an alleged general rule that no student with special education needs would be\n\nplaced at Selzer School. The petition was transferred to the Office of Administrative\n\nLaw.\n\n       During the spring and summer of 2009, J.T. continued to communicate with Dr.\n\nBarbato about A.T.’s kindergarten placement. On August 21, 2009, J.T. wrote to Dr.\n\nBarbato by email: “I do want to withdraw [A.T.]’s petition. I think [A.T.] belongs in [a]\n\ngeneral ed[ucation class], but I am satisfied with revising the modifications and related\n\nservices and I believe that you feel good about the [inclusion class] program and\n\nplacement at Grant.” In September 2009, J.T. expressed some misgivings about A.T.’s\n\nplacement in the inclusion class because she wished to have C.T., A.T.’s sibling, placed\n\nin the inclusion class but also desired to keep the siblings in separate classes, and again\n\nrequested A.T.’s placement at Selzer School. Later that month, Dr. Barbato offered to\n\n                                              5\n\fplace A.T. in a regular class at Selzer School multiple times, but J.T. did not accept the\n\noffers. A.T. was placed in the kindergarten inclusion class at Grant School, located less\n\nthan two miles from his home.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       On September 28, 2009, J.T. filed a class action complaint under IDEA and § 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act. 3 On November 17, 2009, J.T. withdrew her due process\n\npetition. On April 16, 2010, J.T. filed an Amended Class Action Complaint, on behalf of\n\nall kindergartners (and their parents or caregivers) who reside in the town of Dumont and\n\nrequire special education services, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, including a\n\nproposed declaration that defendants “consider placing each kindergartner who requires\n\nspecial education services in regular classrooms in the school they would otherwise\n\nattend if not requiring special education services,” and a proposed order that defendants\n\n“educate Class members, wherever possible, in regular classrooms,” meaning classrooms\n\n“that reflect[] the natural proportion” in the district of children requiring special\n\neducation and those who do not and “are located in the [Class members’] neighborhood\n\nschool.” Meanwhile, A.T. made significant progress in the kindergarten inclusion class at\n\nGrant School, where he stayed throughout his kindergarten year, and returned to Selzer\n\nSchool for first grade.\n\n       Defendants moved for summary judgment, contending plaintiffs did not have\n\nstanding because they failed to allege a legally cognizable injury and, alternatively, failed\n\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fto exhaust their IDEA administrative remedies.

See, e.g., id; C.H., 606 F.3d at 66.\n\n       Plaintiffs also rely on Dr. Barbato’s deposition testimony. Dr. Barbato testified:\n\n       [T]he IEP team would consider the educational placement for every student on an\n       individual basis. . . . I believe the child study team offered a program, and the\n       program is housed at Grant School. I believe they did consider the home school of\n       Selzer, however, the program that was offered or proposed, rather, was provided at\n       Grant School. So . . . I believe the home school was considered, however, the\n       needs of the student in terms of program and services outweighed . . . attending the\n       home school.\n\nAfter making clear he wanted only a “yes” or “no” response, plaintiffs’ counsel asked Dr.\n\nBarbato “once the IEP team determined that student 33 required RP ICR [i.e., placement\n\nin the kindergarten inclusion class], did it have the authority to provide it at Selzer in the\n\n2009/2010 year?” Dr. Barbato responded “No.” Plaintiffs’ counsel then asked the same\n\nquestion for other 2009-2010 kindergartners and received the same response. Plaintiffs\n\nmisconstrue this testimony as evidence of a blanket rule. But Dr. Barbato’s testimony\n\n                                              11\n\fpoints out that once an IEP team considered a student’s individual educational needs and\n\ndetermined those needs would be met best by placing the student in the inclusion class,\n\nthe only available location in 2009-2010 was the inclusion class at Grant School.\n\n       Furthermore, only a few of the kindergartners in Dumont school district who\n\nrequired special education services were placed in the inclusion class each year: in 2008-\n\n2009, four of the eight such kindergartners were placed in the class; in 2009-2010, four of\n\nthe seventeen such kindergartners were placed in the class; and in 2010-2011, only one of\n\nthe eight such kindergartners was placed in the class.\n\n       Plaintiffs do not allege any other violations of IDEA, such as failure to\n\nindividually consider A.T.’s educational needs when developing his IEP or hindering\n\nJ.T.’s participation in the IEP process, nor would they have had a basis for such an\n\nallegation. As the District Court found:\n\n       In this case, the Plaintiffs allege the existence of a rigid rule, but there is no denial\n       of services, opportunities, participation, or benefits. The IEP team determined that\n       A.T. needed the support of an in-class special education teacher, and Dumont\n       provided one in the inclusion class. No evidence suggests that the placement of\n       A.T., or any other student in the inclusion class, was inappropriate or that the\n       placement decision was made without considering A.T.’s individual needs. In\n       addition, J.T. had discussions with Dumont about A.T.’s IEP prior to the IEP\n       meeting, and during the meeting, J.T. had the opportunity to discuss her concerns.\n\nJ.T., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1044556</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. “Undisputedly, Dumont has, through the IEP process,\n\nindividually determined that certain kindergartners need particular special education\n\nservices, and provided these services in a classroom with other kindergarteners who need\n\nno such services.” Id.

Busing\n\nstudents to a centralized location for special services may be integral to IDEA\n\ncompliance and, depending on the IEP, is sought by many parents of children with\n\nspecial needs.\n\n       Furthermore, there is no evidence that plaintiffs were educated apart from other\n\nchildren within Grant School. Within the inclusion class, the large majority of students\n\neach year did not need special education, so placement in the class would not have\n\nmarked a student as with “special needs.” In 2008-2009, the inclusion class contained\n\nfour kindergartners with special needs and twelve without; in 2009-2010, it contained\n\nfour kindergartners with special needs and thirteen without; in 2010-2011, it contained\n\nonly one kindergartner with special needs and sixteen without. Nor is the inclusion class\n\nsegregated from other classes. An educational consultant found “the kindergarten is\n\nlocated on a floor with other typical classes and is not isolated in any manner. . . . The\n\n[inclusion class] is a typical kindergarten and has the same physical and social access to\n\nthe school as any kindergarten class would.” A paraprofessional who worked in the\n\ninclusion class testified the other classes on the same floor as the inclusion class were an\n\nart class, a music class, a speech class, an enrichment class, and a self-contained class.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       IDEA “establishes an elaborate procedural mechanism to protect the rights of”\n\n                                             16\n\fspecial needs children, including “the right to a due process hearing before an\n\nadministrative official.” Komninos by Komninos v.

(citing what is now 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A)). IDEA\n\n“thus grants subject matter jurisdiction to the district courts. However, it is clear from the\n\nlanguage of the Act that Congress intended plaintiffs to complete the administrative\n\nprocess before resorting to federal court.” Id. Exhaustion of the IDEA administrative\n\nprocess is also required, “to the same extent as would be required had the action been\n\nbrought under” IDEA, before filing a civil action under Title V of the Rehabilitation Act,\n\n29 U.S.C. § 791 et seq., “seeking relief that is also available under” IDEA. 20 U.S.C. §\n\n1415(l).6\n\n       Plaintiffs concede they failed to exhaust their IDEA administrative remedies\n\nbefore bringing their putative class action in federal court. There is a strong policy of\n\nrequiring exhaustion. Komninos, 13 F.3d at 778.\n\n       This exhaustion rule serves a number of important purposes, including (1)\n       permitting the exercise of agency discretion and expertise on issues requiring these\n       characteristics; (2) allowing the full development of technical issues and a factual\n       record prior to court review; (3) preventing deliberate disregard and circumvention\n       of agency procedures established by Congress; and (4) avoiding unnecessary\n       judicial decisions by giving the agency the first opportunity to correct any error.\n\n\n6\n  In addressing this issue, plaintiffs contend they seek relief under the Rehabilitation Act\nthat is not available under IDEA: the school district’s consideration of whether providing\nspecial education services in students’ local schools would be unduly burdensome.

Accordingly, the\n\nprocedure through which the school district placed A.T. in the inclusion class is not\n\nrendered a systemic issue simply because J.T. raises it in a putative class action.\n\n       In Romer, the Tenth Circuit addressed a claim similar to that here: that a\n\ndepartment of education had denied a class of children “appropriately individualized IEPs\n\nbecause its policies arbitrarily predetermine the duration of [extended school day] and\n\n[extended school year] services and use a single criterion to determine eligibility for\n\n[extended school year] services.” 992 F.2d at 1043. The plaintiffs failed to exhaust their\n\nIDEA administrative remedies before bringing their class action. Id. The court held the\n\n                                              19\n\fexceptions to the exhaustion requirement were not met because “[t]he violations alleged\n\nand relief requested in this case . . . target . . . the effect of a single component of [the\n\ndepartment of education]’s educational program on individual children’s IEPs.” Id. at\n\n1044. “The determination of whether [the department of education]’s policies have\n\ndenied children with disabilities appropriately individualized IEPs entails a factually\n\nintensive inquiry into the circumstances of each individual child’s case. This is precisely\n\nthe kind of issue the IDEA’s administrative process was designed to address.” Id.\n\n       Similarly, plaintiffs here claim Dumont school district failed to individually\n\nconsider their educational placements. This claim addresses only one component of the\n\nschool district’s educational program, which, as the District Court found, “is limited to a\n\nsmall subset of [special needs] students in Dumont, at only one grade level –\n\nkindergarten.” J.T., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1044556</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *10. Resolving this claim entails “a factually\n\nintensive inquiry into the circumstances of each individual child’s case.” Romer, 992\n\nF.2d at 1044. Accordingly, there is no reason to excuse plaintiffs’ failure to exhaust the\n\nIDEA administrative process, which was designed to address “precisely th[is] kind of\n\nissue.” Id.\n\n                                              VI.7\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s grant of summary\n\njudgment and discovery order.\n\n\n7\n During discovery, the District Court ordered the parties to split the cost of creating\nmirror images of the computer hard drives of two school district administrative\npersonnel.
