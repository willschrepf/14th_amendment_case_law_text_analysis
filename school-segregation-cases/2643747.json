Bonham Corp., Appellants\n\n                                                  v.\n\n                                  Larry Wayne Grant, Appellee\n\n\n    FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF SAN SABA COUNTY, 33RD JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n         NO. 8086, HONORABLE GUILFORD L. JONES III, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                                           OPINION\n\n\n               We withdraw the opinion dated August 13, 2014, and the supplemental opinion and\n\njudgment dated September 26, 2014, and substitute the following opinion and judgment in their\n\nplace. We deny the Appellants’ motion for rehearing.\n\n               This suit arises from a now infamous feud between neighboring cattle ranchers in\n\nSan Saba, the details of which have been thoroughly relayed in prior opinions of this Court and\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court. See Bennett v. Reynolds, 242 S.W.3d 866 (Tex. App.—Austin 2007),\n\nrev’d & remanded in part by 315 S.W.3d 867 (Tex. 2010) (Bennett I). The feud between cattle\n\nranchers Thomas O. Bennett and Randy Reynolds has many turbulent twists and turns, see id., but\n\nthe gist of the dispute and subject of prior appeals involved allegations that thirteen head of cattle\n\fbelonging to Reynolds had wandered onto Bennett’s ranch, and that instead of returning them in a\n\nneighborly fashion, Bennett ordered his ranch hand—Larry Grant—to round up the cattle and sell\n\nthem at auction. Grant testified that he raised concerns with Bennett that the cattle did not belong\n\nto him, but Bennett ignored his concerns.1 Worried that he could be implicated in cattle theft, Grant\n\npurchased a disposable camera and took several photos of the cattle loaded on Bennett’s trailer\n\nprior to the sale. Within two months of the sale, Grant left his employment with Bennett but kept\n\nthe secret photos stashed away in a box in his home where they were seemingly forgotten and left\n\nundisturbed for almost a year. Reynolds, however, eventually learned of the secret photos after a\n\nchance encounter with Grant’s brother-in-law and demanded that Grant turn the photos over to the\n\nauthorities. What happens next is hotly disputed and the subject of litigation between Bennett and\n\nhis former ranch hand, Grant, which gave rise to this appeal.\n\n                After Reynolds attempted to obtain the photos, Grant testified that he was distressed\n\nand began drinking beer and smoking marijuana to relieve tension. He then made a series of\n\nphone calls to Bennett and Bennett’s friend and employee, Don “Ex” Rogers. Grant testified that\n\nthe purpose of the calls was to inform Bennett of the pictures and give him an opportunity to “make\n\nit right” with Reynolds. Bennett and Rogers’ version, however, depicts Grant as calling to try and\n\nsell the photographs to Bennett. Grant acknowledged he had some discussion with Rogers about\n\nselling the photos to Bennett but testified that they only “joked about it.” It was no joke, however,\n\nwhen Grant turned the photos over to law enforcement about a month after these conversations\n\nand triggered an extraordinary series of events. First, Bennett was indicted for cattle theft based\n\n\n       1\n           The facts recited herein are taken from the record on appeal.\n\n                                                  2\n\fin part on Grant’s testimony and photos. Although ultimately acquitted of the criminal charges,\n\nBennett and his cattle company, the James B. Bonham Corporation, were found liable for conversion\n\nin a civil suit brought by Reynolds resulting in a judgment of $5,327.11 in actual damages. The\n\nactual damages, however, paled in comparison to the combined exemplary damages of $1.25\n\nmillion awarded amidst allegations that Bennett had willfully sold his neighbor’s cattle to settle\n\na score in a long-standing feud and then attempted to cover his actions by—among other\n\nallegations—threatening and bribing witnesses, tampering with the photographs Grant had taken to\n\nalter the images of the brands on the cattle to look like his own brand, and even attempting to\n\nregister his neighbor’s brand as his own with the district clerk of San Saba County. Such allegations\n\nand such a large exemplary damages award are extraordinary by themselves,2 but it is only half of the\n\nstory and less than half of the total liability adjudged against Bennett and the Bonham Corporation\n\nfrom these events.\n\n               The other half is the subject of this appeal—a $2.28 million judgment awarded to\n\nGrant for a successful malicious prosecution claim brought against Bennett and the Bonham\n\nCorporation. This claim arose from Bennett’s admitted, yet ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to\n\nhave Grant imprisoned after he turned the photos over to authorities. In this appeal, Bennett and\n\nthe Bonham Corporation (collectively, Appellants) contest the judgment in Grant’s malicious\n\nprosecution suit, contending: (1) legally insufficient evidence supported the malicious prosecution\n\nclaim; (2) legally and factually insufficient evidence supported the $10,703 awarded in compensatory\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Indeed, the Texas Supreme Court found the exemplary damages violated due process and\nremanded the case for remittitur. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 883.\n\n                                                 3\n\fdamages; (3) legally insufficient evidence supported the jury’s findings allowing for the imposition\n\nof exemplary damages over the statutory cap; and (4) the total $2 million exemplary damages award\n\n($1 million against Bennett and $1 million against the Bonham Corporation) violated due process.\n\nIndividually, the Bonham Corporation raises several arguments challenging its liability in the suit,\n\nand Bennett challenges a $269,644.50 sanction. We conclude that the award of exemplary damages\n\nfailed to comport with due process requirements and required remittitur, but otherwise uphold the\n\ntrial court’s judgment.\n\n\n                                  MALICIOUS PROSECUTION\n\n\nA.      Background Facts\n\n                On the evening of October 4, 2001, telephone records confirm that Grant called\n\nand spoke with Bennett for thirteen minutes, but the topic of conversation that evening is hotly\n\ndisputed by the parties. As previously discussed, Grant testified that he called to inform Bennett\n\nabout the pictures and to give him an opportunity to “make it right” with Reynolds. Bennett,\n\nhowever, testified that Grant called to try and sell the photos to him for $5,000. What is undisputed,\n\nhowever, is that Bennett waited nearly two years to report his allegations against Grant to the\n\nauthorities. Indeed, Bennett testified that it was not until after his criminal trial that he decided to\n\nreport the incident to authorities and acknowledged at trial that his sole “goal” in reporting the\n\nincident was to put “Grant in prison . . . for what he’s done to me.” In furtherance of his goal, Bennett\n\ntestified he met with law enforcement authorities in four separate counties in an attempt to get\n\nGrant indicted for attempted blackmail. After authorities in San Saba County, Llano County, and\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fColeman County refused to prosecute Grant, Bennett met with the district attorney in Navarro County\n\nand requested he prosecute the case.\n\n               According to the district attorney’s testimony, the following events then transpired.\n\nAfter his initial meeting with Bennett, the district attorney believed that if an attempted blackmail\n\nhad occurred, it was a federal offense and referred the matter to the federal authorities. Unhappy\n\nwith this outcome, Bennett again approached the district attorney but this time with a new\n\ntheory—requesting that Grant be prosecuted for attempted theft. The district attorney informed\n\nBennett he could not bring charges for misdemeanor attempted theft because it was barred by the\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations. Undeterred, Bennett then provided the district attorney with new\n\ninformation, alleging—for the first time—that Grant had attempted to extort money from him a\n\nsecond time within the limitations period. The district attorney testified that he was “skeptical” of\n\nthis new evidence because it “appeared that there was maybe some tailoring of the facts going on to\n\nfit the statute.” Indeed, in his sworn testimony in this case, Bennett made no mention of a second\n\nattempted blackmail by Grant. Rather, he unequivocally testified that all the factual accusations\n\nagainst Grant occurred in a single evening on October 4, 2011. The district attorney further testified\n\nthat, based on his conversations with Bennett about the case, he formed the impression that\n\nBennett’s motive for prosecuting Grant was to gain an advantage in civil litigation arising from the\n\ncase. Being “suspicious” of Bennett’s new evidence, the district attorney decided to “dig in his heels”\n\nand refused to prosecute.\n\n               Still undeterred, Bennett met with an attorney who testified that he had represented\n\nthe Bonham Corporation for over twenty years and that Bennett directed him to research and draft\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fa legal brief advocating that Grant’s alleged actions constituted a criminal offense that should be\n\nprosecuted. The district attorney testified that it was this brief or another meeting with Bennett that\n\nfinally was the “catalyst” that prompted him to bring the case to the grand jury. He further testified\n\nthat it was “rare” for him to bring misdemeanor cases to the grand jury because he himself had the\n\nauthority to bring misdemeanor charges without grand jury involvement. But, in this case, he finally\n\nyielded to Bennett’s demands because he did not want to appear “draconian” in his refusal to bring\n\ncharges. The district attorney may have been finally persuaded to present the case, but the grand jury\n\nwas not as persuaded and refused to indict Grant.\n\n                Frustrated that the grand jury had not indicted Grant, Bennett testified he again\n\nmet with the same attorney who this time advised him to get a special prosecutor appointed in\n\nNavarro County to bring the case before the grand jury a second time. After the attorney explained\n\nto him the procedure for appointing a special prosecutor, Bennett testified he had the attorney draft\n\na petition alleging the district attorney had a conflict of interest and accusing him of taking no\n\naction in the case.3 The petition further sought the appointment of Robert Dunn—a local attorney\n\nand neighbor of Bennett’s—as a special prosecutor for the case. Bennett, who resided and ran a\n\ncattle ranch in Navarro County, testified that he then led the effort to circulate and obtain over 250\n\nsignatures from Navarro County residents for the petition seeking the appointment of Dunn as\n\nspecial prosecutor for the case. Bennett testified that others helped with the petition but that “it was\n\nmostly me . . . I think I done most of it.” The district attorney, who was now seeking reelection\n\n\n\n\n        3\n         The petition alleged the district attorney had a conflict of interest in the case because he\nhad previously worked for the district attorney’s office in Llano County.\n\n                                                   6\n\fin a hotly contested race, testified that he was unaware that Bennett was leading this campaign\n\nthroughout the county until Bennett showed up at his office for a final meeting. Bennett, with the\n\nsigned petitions in hand, then accused the district attorney of being partial and unfair when he\n\npresented Grant’s case to the grand jury and demanded that Dunn be appointed special prosecutor\n\nin the case. Feeling that Bennett’s petition campaign “wasn’t helping” his chances of reelection,\n\nthe district attorney testified that he agreed to the appointment of Dunn as special prosecutor in\n\nthe case.4\n\n               Ultimately, Bennett was successful in his goal of getting Grant indicted, as the\n\nspecial prosecutor presented the case for a second time to the grand jury—more than four years\n\nafter the phone call between Grant and Bennett occurred—but this time obtained indictments for the\n\nfelony offenses of tampering with a witness and attempted bribery. The special prosecutor testified\n\nthat in deciding whether to present the case to the grand jury, he interviewed both Bennett and\n\nRogers but exercised independent discretion in ultimately determining whether there was sufficient\n\nevidence to prosecute the case. He testified further that he relied on evidence other than Bennett’s\n\nand Rogers’ statements in his decision to prosecute. When asked, however, whether Bennett’s and\n\nRogers’ statements were “very material to [his] decision to proceed to the grand jury,” the special\n\nprosecutor acknowledged that the statements were “definitely” very material to his decision. Further,\n\nhe acknowledged testifying during his deposition that he “would not have presented” the case to the\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          Later that year, the district attorney lost his reelection. Almost immediately after starting\nprivate practice, Bennett came to the former district attorney’s office and retained him as counsel\nfor himself and the Bonham Corporation in two separate lawsuits.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fgrand jury if he had believed Bennett “was making untrue statements.” He also testified that if he\n\nbelieved there had been a “tailoring of the facts” by Bennett—as the Navarro County district attorney\n\nbelieved—that it would have affected his decision to go to the grand jury.5 Grant maintained\n\nthroughout trial that both men had lied to the authorities about the alleged blackmail.\n\n                Further, some of the evidence Bennett presented to the special prosecutor appears\n\nfrom the record to have differed from the initial evidence presented to the district attorney. First,\n\nthere is no evidence in the record that Bennett reported to the special prosecutor two incidents of\n\nalleged extortion occurring on different dates—as he had to the district attorney. Rather, the special\n\nprosecutor testified only as to the alleged misconduct occurring during phone conversations on\n\nOctober 4, 2011, and the indictment alleged only one count—not two—of the charged offenses.\n\nSecond, Bennett added a new detail to his allegations, contending for the first time that Grant had\n\nspecifically asked him to pay $5,000 for the pictures. In a previous written statement to the\n\nauthorities, Bennett did not allege a specified amount in his extortion claims. The Navarro County\n\ndistrict attorney also did not recall Bennett telling him this detail, and it would have been material\n\nto how he presented the case to the grand jury because the amount of money at issue increased the\n\ndegree of the offense.6 See Tex. Penal Code § 31.03(e) (value of property involved in theft dictates\n\nclassification of offense). Finally, the special prosecutor additionally testified that in deciding to\n\n        5\n           The Navarro County district attorney testified that he had informed the special prosecutor\nof his belief that there had been some tailoring of the facts by Bennett. The special prosecutor denied\nthis, testifying that “no one had told [him]” of any manipulation of the facts by Bennett.\n        6\n          Interestingly, the district attorney testified that the amount at issue increased the degree of\nthe offense from a misdemeanor to a felony. The statute of limitations for felony theft is five years,\nrather than the two year statute of limitations for misdemeanor theft. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\narts. 12.01(4)(A), 12.02.\n\n                                                   8\n\fprosecute the case, he relied—in part—on a transcript from Bennett purportedly transcribing\n\nsecretly-taped “conversations” with Grant that substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant had sought\n\n$5,000 from him. If this transcript was also given to the district attorney, he made no reference to\n\nit in his testimony.\n\n                Regarding the transcript, the special prosecutor testified that initially Bennett\n\npresented him with a tape recording of “conversations” but that he was unable to understand it\n\nbecause it was “awful garbled.” Bennett then gave him a transcript purportedly transcribing the\n\ntape. The special prosecutor could not testify as to when the tape was allegedly recorded, but it\n\nappears from his testimony that he believed the tape was a recording of the actual telephone\n\nconversations reflected on Grant’s telephone bill or conversations related directly to those phone\n\nrecords. He further testified that the taped conversations substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant\n\nhad specifically sought “$5,000” for the pictures. This transcript, however, was destroyed when\n\nGrant’s record was later expunged. Besides this information, there is no additional information in\n\nthe record as to what was reflected in the transcript or the tape. Bennett himself testified at trial that\n\nhe had secretly recorded a conversation with Grant and had presented this tape to law enforcement,\n\nbut this tape recorded only a single conversation between Grant and Bennett occurring almost a year\n\nprior to Grant’s alleged extortion. As such, there is no mention on the tape of the photographs or\n\na demand for $5,000. Indeed, when the special prosecutor was presented with a transcript of the tape\n\nBennett testified to presenting to other law enforcement, the special prosecutor testified that he had\n\nnever seen it before, and it was “completely different” than the transcript Bennett had given him.\n\n                Bennett’s plan to imprison Grant seemed to finally be coming to fruition when the\n\nspecial prosecutor then took this evidence to a second grand jury and succeeded in obtaining two\n\n                                                    9\n\ffelony indictments, and Grant surrendered himself to authorities. But Bennett’s long and hard-fought\n\nquest ended nine months later, when both of Grant’s indictments were quashed because the charges\n\nhad been filed past the statute of limitations. Further, the trial court granted Grant’s motion to have\n\nhis arrest and indictments expunged from his record as void. Upon expunction, Grant—who was\n\nalready being sued by Bennett for slander—added a counterclaim against Bennett and the Bonham\n\nCorporation for malicious criminal prosecution.7 Upon hearing the preceding evidence, the jury found\n\nthat Bennett and the Bonham Corporation had indeed maliciously prosecuted Grant. They appeal,\n\ncontending there is insufficient evidence of a malicious prosecution. Appellants’ claim requires us to\n\nfirst expound upon the law of malicious prosecution.\n\n\nB.     Malicious Prosecution\n\n                Malicious prosecution is an unusual tort in that it requires the court to balance\n\nsociety’s interest in protecting private persons who report criminal conduct with the individual\n\ncitizen’s interest in being protected against unjustifiable and oppressive litigation of criminal\n\ncharges. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. v. Liek, 881 S.W.2d 288, 290–91 (Tex. 1994). In that regard,\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court has instructed us that the balance between these important interests is\n\nmaintained by strictly adhering to the defined elements of an action for malicious prosecution and\n\nthat even a small departure from the exact prerequisites for liability may threaten this delicate\n\nbalance. Id. But, “as with any other cause of action, if the elements of malicious prosecution are\n\nproved, liability is established.” Id. at 291. Those elements are: (1) the commencement of a criminal\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           The jury found against Bennett on his slander claim, which Bennett does not appeal.\n\n                                                  10\n\fprosecution against the plaintiff; (2) causation of the action by the defendant; (3) termination of the\n\nprosecution in the plaintiff’s favor; (4) the plaintiff’s innocence; (5) the absence of probable cause\n\nfor the proceedings; (6) malice in filing the charges; and (7) damages. Richey v. Brookshire Grocery\n\nCo., 952 S.W.2d 515, 517 (Tex. 1997).\n\n                Appellants do not dispute the jury’s findings that there was no probable cause to\n\nprosecute Grant, that Grant was innocent of the charges, and that Bennett acted with malice in\n\npursuing the charges. Rather, they argue only that there is legally insufficient evidence that Bennett’s\n\nconduct caused the commencement of a criminal prosecution against Grant. The causation element\n\nof malicious prosecution requires evidence that a defendant “initiated” or “procured” a criminal\n\nprosecution. Lieck, 881 S.W.2d at 292. A person initiates a criminal prosecution if he makes a\n\nformal charge to law enforcement authorities. Id. Here, there is no evidence in the record that\n\nBennett filed any formal charges; Grant, therefore, relies on procurement. A person “procures” a\n\ncriminal prosecution “if his actions are enough to cause the prosecution, and but for his actions the\n\nprosecution would not have occurred.” Id. Thus, procurement requires that a person’s actions be\n\nboth a “necessary and a sufficient cause of the criminal prosecution.” Id. Appellants argue there is\n\nno evidence Bennett “procured” Grant’s criminal prosecution because the prosecutors involved\n\nacted with independent discretion, and their exercise of discretion was a superceding, intervening\n\ncause of the prosecution that destroyed his own liability in bringing about the charges. Appellants\n\nare correct that generally a person cannot procure a criminal prosecution when the decision whether\n\nto prosecute is left to the discretion of another because the independent exercise of discretion\n\ndestroys the necessary causal link between the defendant and the prosecution. See id. There are,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fhowever, two important exceptions to this rule where a defendant may still be liable for malicious\n\nprosecution because his actions are such that it makes an intelligent exercise of discretion impossible:\n\n(1) when a defendant provides information which he knows is false that causes a criminal prosecution,\n\nor (2) when a defendant’s conduct was the determining factor in the prosecutor’s decision to\n\nprosecute. See id. at 292–94. We conclude there is legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding of causation under both exceptions.\n\n\n        1.      Legally sufficient evidence Bennett procured Grant’s prosecutions by providing\n                false information.\n\n                The first exception is when a defendant provides information which he knows is false\n\nthat causes a criminal prosecution. See id. at 293. For this exception, the plaintiff must prove both\n\nthat the defendant knowingly furnished false information to authorities, and that but for such false\n\ninformation, the prosecutor would not have decided to prosecute. King v. Graham, 126 S.W.3d 75,\n\n76 (Tex. 2003). The prosecutor’s reliance on the false information makes an intelligent exercise\n\nof discretion impossible and establishes the causal link necessary to hold the defendant liable for\n\nmalicious prosecution. See id. at 78. But, if the decision to prosecute would have been made\n\nwith or without the false information, the defendant did not cause the prosecution by supplying\n\nfalse information. A single prosecution may, however, be procured by more than one person. Lieck,\n\n881 S.W.2d at 292.\n\n                Appellants challenge only the legal sufficiency of the jury’s finding that Bennett\n\nprocured Grant’s prosecution. A party challenging the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting\n\nan adverse finding on an issue for which the opposing party bears the burden of proof will prevail\n\n\n\n                                                  12\n\fif there is a complete absence of evidence of a vital fact or if the evidence offered to prove a vital\n\nfact is no more than a scintilla. See Waste Mgmt. of Tex., Inc. v. Texas Disposal Sys. Landfill, Inc.,\n\nNo. 12-0522-CV, 2014 WL 1875637, at *8 (Tex. May 9, 2014); City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d\n\n802, 810 (Tex. 2005). More than a scintilla exists when the evidence as a whole rises to a level\n\nenabling reasonable and fair-minded people to have different conclusions. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.\n\nv. Havner, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997). In conducting a legal-sufficiency review, we consider\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, crediting evidence that a reasonable fact\n\nfinder could have considered favorable and disregarding unfavorable evidence unless the reasonable\n\nfact finder could not. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 807. We indulge every reasonable inference that\n\nsupports the jury’s findings. Id. at 822. Therefore, we must uphold the jury’s verdict unless—after\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict and disregarding contrary\n\nevidence unless a reasonable jury could not—there is no more than a scintilla of evidence to support\n\nthe finding of procurement.\n\n               Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the Navarro\n\nCounty district attorney believed Bennett’s claims were barred by limitations and would never have\n\nbrought this case before the grand jury but for Bennett changing his story to add an additional claim\n\nof extortion occurring within the limitations period. As Grant testified this was a false allegation,\n\nwe will assume—for purposes of our analysis—that the allegation was false, and there is more than\n\nsufficient evidence that the false allegation was the but-for cause of the prosecutor presenting the\n\ncase to the grand jury. Traditionally, however, the tort of malicious prosecution does not arise until\n\nprocess is issued, an indictment is returned, information filed, or the accused is arrested. See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 654 (1977). Here, there is no evidence in the record that any of\n\n                                                 13\n\fthese events occurred with regard to this first proceeding before the grand jury or that Grant was\n\naware of or suffered damages from this proceeding. Accordingly, the bulk of our analysis must\n\nfocus on the second presentment of the case to the grand jury by the special prosecutor, which\n\nultimately resulted in two indictments and Grant’s arrest.\n\n               Viewing the evidence regarding the second grand jury proceeding in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict, we conclude there was more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding that Bennett procured the prosecution. The special prosecutor acknowledged in his testimony\n\nthat Bennett’s statements were “definitely . . . very material” to his decision to proceed to the grand\n\njury. He further acknowledged that if he had believed Bennett’s statements were untruthful, then\n\nhe “would not have presented” the case to the grand jury. Assuming Bennett’s statements were false,\n\nthe special prosecutor’s testimony provides more than a scintilla of evidence that Bennett was a\n\nnecessary and sufficient cause of the prosecution. Compare King, 126 S.W.3d at 79 (holding\n\ninsufficient evidence of causation where “[n]othing in the record shows that the false information\n\nwas material to the decision to prosecute”). Further, there was additional evidence that the special\n\nprosecutor relied on the transcript that Bennett had given him allegedly transcribing secretly-taped\n\nconversations with Grant. From the record, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer\n\nthat Bennett had fabricated this evidence and that it was a material cause of the prosecution, as the\n\nspecial prosecutor testified that the transcript substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant had sought\n\n$5,000 from him.\n\n               For legal sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe judgment, crediting evidence that a reasonable fact finder could have considered favorable and\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fdisregarding unfavorable evidence unless a reasonable fact finder could not. See City of Keller,\n\n168 S.W.3d at 827. We note here the special prosecutor testified that—in addition to the information\n\nprovided by Bennett—he also relied on Grant’s sworn testimony from Bennett’s prior criminal trial\n\nfor cattle theft. At that trial, the special prosecutor testified Grant purportedly admitted making a\n\nphone call to Rogers seeking money for the pictures but alleged he was only “joking.”8 The special\n\nprosecutor testified that in his opinion Grant “tried to cover himself” by alleging that it was a joke,\n\nand when asked whether he would have prosecuted based solely on this testimony, he responded:\n\n“I think so, because the fact is that he admitted making the calls.” (emphasis added). When a\n\nprosecutor relies on evidence independent of the false information provided by the defendant, the\n\ndefendant “cannot be said to have caused the prosecution if the [false] information was immaterial\n\nto the decision to prosecute.” King, 126 S.W.3d at 78. The special prosecutor, however, had\n\npreviously acknowledged that Bennett’s evidence was definitely very material to his decision to\n\nprosecute and that he would not have presented the case if he had thought Bennett was providing\n\nfalse information.9\n\n\n\n       8\n         The transcript from Grant’s sworn testimony is not in the record. Grant advanced the same\ntheory of innocence at this trial. For purposes of the malicious prosecution claim, the jury found\nGrant innocent of Bennett’s allegations.\n       9\n          The special prosecutor also testified that he relied on Rogers’ statement that Grant had\ntelephoned him and acknowledged attempting to sell the photos to Bennett. At trial, Bennett testified\nthat Rogers “was in on the efforts to get [Grant] charged.” Rogers is described in the record as\nBennett’s best friend and an employee of the Bonham Corporation. At trial, Grant denied Rogers’\naccusations, and the jury was free to disbelieve his testimony. The Texas Supreme Court has\ninstructed that “[j]ust as there may be more than one proximate cause of an event, a single\nprosecution may be procured by more than one person.” Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc. v. Lieck, 881\nS.W.2d 288, 292 (Tex. 1994). The fact that Rogers may also be liable for procuring Grant’s\nprosecution does not negate Bennett’s own liability.\n\n                                                  15\n\f                To the extent there is any conflict in the special prosecutor’s testimony as to the cause\n\nof the prosecution, causation is generally a question of fact for the jury, see Rodriguez v. Moerbe,\n\n963 S.W.2d 808, 818–19 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet. denied), and there is more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence to support the jury’s fact finding that Bennett’s false information was a\n\nnecessary and sufficient cause of the prosecution. Further, the jury was entitled to resolve any\n\nconflicts in the special prosecutor’s testimony and could choose to believe or disbelieve all or part of\n\nhis testimony. See McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex. 1986) (jury may “resolve\n\ninconsistencies in the testimony of any witness”); see also City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819 (“Jurors\n\nare the sole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to give their testimony. . . .\n\nReviewing courts cannot impose their own opinions to the contrary.”). Consequently, we conclude\n\na reasonable jury could find that the false information provided by Bennett was a necessary and\n\nsufficient cause of Grant’s prosecution and disregard any contrary evidence. After reviewing the\n\nevidence under the appropriate standard, we conclude there is legally sufficient evidence to support\n\nthe jury’s finding that Bennett procured Grant’s criminal prosecution by providing false information.\n\n\n        2.      Legally sufficient evidence Bennett procured Grant’s prosecution by other\n                improper conduct.\n\n                The second exception in which a defendant may be liable for malicious prosecution\n\nis “when his conduct is the determining factor in the prosecutor’s decision to prosecute.”10 See\n\n\n        10\n          Appellants contend this is not a recognized exception under Texas law. We disagree. In\naccordance with the Restatement of Torts, the Texas Supreme Court has stated that a defendant may\nprocure a prosecution “not only when he gives information he knows is false to a prosecutor, but also\nwhen his conduct is the determining factor in the prosecutor’s decision to prosecute.” Browning-\nFerris Indus., Inc. v. Lieck, 881 S.W.2d 288, 294 (Tex. 1994) (citing Restatement (Second) of Torts\n\n                                                   16\n\fLieck, 881 S.W.2d at 294. For this exception to be applicable, it must “appear that [the defendant’s]\n\ndesire to have the proceedings initiated, expressed by direction, request or pressure of any kind,\n\nwas the determining factor in the official’s decision to commence the prosecution.” Id. (quoting\n\nRestatement (Second) Torts § 653 (1977)). The Texas Supreme Court in 1994 adopted this exception\n\nset out in the Restatement of Torts. See id. We note, however, that the parties have not cited to, and\n\nwe have not found, any Texas case that has determined what type of conduct would constitute\n\n“procurement” under this exception. See Michol O’Connor, O’Connor’s Texas Causes of Action,\n\nch. 19-A, at 572 (2014) (“No Texas court has determined what type of conduct, other than providing\n\nfalse information, would constitute procurement.”). After careful review of the record in this case,\n\nwe conclude this is the rare case where the defendant engaged in such an intentional and systematic\n\nabuse of the justice system that there was sufficient evidence his conduct was the determining factor\n\nin the prosecution.\n\n               As there are no examples under Texas case law, we will draw upon the Restatement\n\nitself for guidance. The Restatement provides the following example as illustration of this exception:\n\n\n               A goes to B, a district attorney and informs him that C has committed a\n       battery upon A. A is a political boss to whom B owes his election. A demands that\n       B prosecute C. The battery is one that has created no public disturbance and is\n       therefore an offense for which a public prosecutor would not ordinarily institute\n       proceedings. In compliance with A’s demand, B files an information against C. A\n       has procured the institution of the proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n§ 653 (1977)); see also Turner v. Roadway Express, Inc., 911 S.W.2d 224, 226 (Tex. App.—Fort\nWorth 1995, writ denied) (recognizing Texas Supreme Court’s holding in Lieck that malicious\nprosecution may occur when either a person gives false information to authorities or when a person’s\nconduct was determining factor in decision to prosecute).\n\n                                                 17\n\fRestatement (Second) Torts § 653 (1977). In the example, the defendant procured the prosecution\n\nby exerting improper pressure on the district attorney to bring charges that ordinarily would not have\n\nbeen filed. Similarly, in this case, there is legally sufficient evidence in the record that Grant would\n\nnot have been prosecuted but for Bennett’s acknowledged and systematic campaign to improperly\n\ninfluence the proceedings. First, the Navarro County district attorney testified emphatically that\n\nalthough he had the authority to file an information charging Grant with misdemeanor attempted\n\ntheft, he “dug in his heels” and steadfastly refused to press charges against Grant because of the\n\nstatute of limitations and because he believed Bennett had been tailoring the facts to create a\n\nchargeable offense. Only after immense pressure from Bennett and some altering of the facts, did\n\nthe district attorney finally yield and agree to bring the misdemeanor case before the grand jury.\n\nHe testified, however, that ordinarily he would not have presented this misdemeanor case to the\n\ngrand jury but only did so because of Bennett’s unceasing demands. Like the example in the\n\nRestatement, this proceeding before the grand jury would never have occurred but for Bennett\n\nexerting such pressure on the district attorney that his desire to have the proceeding commenced was\n\nthe determining factor in the district attorney’s decision to prosecute.\n\n                After the grand jury refused to indict, Bennett—undeterred in his goal of having\n\nGrant imprisoned—then organized and led an extraordinary petition campaign to put in place a\n\nhand-picked special prosecutor to indict Grant. At a time when the district attorney was facing a\n\nheavily-contested election, Bennett then came to the district attorney’s office with the petitions\n\ndemanding the appointment of his special prosecutor to the case. Feeling Bennett’s petition campaign\n\n“wasn’t helping” his chances of reelection, the district attorney again yielded to Bennett’s demands.\n\nHere, like the example in the Restatement, Grant’s second prosecution was a proceeding that would\n\n                                                  18\n\fhave never occurred but for Bennett’s exertion of untoward pressure on the district attorney.\n\nUndoubtedly, there is more than a scintilla of evidence that Bennett’s acknowledged and systematic\n\ncampaign to improperly influence judicial proceedings was the determining factor in the prosecution.\n\n                Accordingly, we conclude there is legally sufficient evidence that Bennett procured\n\nGrant’s prosecution by either providing false information to authorities or by engaging in such a\n\nsystematic and untoward campaign to influence judicial proceedings that his conduct was the\n\ndetermining factor in the prosecution.\n\n\n                                    CORPORATE LIABILITY\n\n                Having found sufficient evidence of Bennett’s liability in this suit, we next\n\naddress Bonham’s liability. With regard to Bonham, the jury made several alternate findings\n\nimputing corporate liability on Bonham for the malicious prosecution. First, under the malicious\n\nprosecution question, the jury found that both Bennett and Bonham—through an agent—had\n\nmaliciously prosecuted Grant. Second, the jury found that Bennett was acting in his capacity as\n\na vice-principal of Bonham when he maliciously prosecuted Grant. Finally, the jury found that\n\nBonham was responsible for Bennett’s conduct under a “reverse-piercing” theory of liability. In\n\ntwo individual issues, Bonham contests its liability, arguing: (1) that it was improperly joined as a\n\nparty to the suit and (2) there is no evidence to support the jury’s findings of corporate liability.\n\n\nA.      Joinder\n\n                In its first individual issue, Bonham contends that it was improperly joined as a party\n\nto this suit. A trial court is given a great deal of discretion in matters of joinder, and its decision on\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fsuch procedural issues will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Varme v. Gordon,\n\n881 S.W.2d 877, 882 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1994, writ denied). A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it has acted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner, or when it acts without reference\n\nto any guiding principle. Coburn v. Moreland, 433 S.W.3d 809, 823 (Tex. App.—Austin 2014, no\n\npet.). A trial court’s decision on the matter of the joinder of an additional party is “generally based\n\non practical considerations with a view to fair, orderly and timely prosecution and disposal of\n\npending litigation.” Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. McDaniel, 327 S.W.2d 358, 373 (Tex. Civ.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 1959, no writ).\n\n               Bonham’s misjoinder claim necessitates a brief review of this case’s procedural\n\nhistory. This suit was originally initiated by Bennett—the plaintiff in this suit—filing an original\n\npetition suing Grant for slander. In his original answer, Grant asserted a counterclaim against\n\nBennett for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Later, in an amended pleading, Grant\n\nadded Bonham as an additional counter-defendant to his intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim. Upon request of the trial court, Grant then filed a motion seeking leave to include\n\nBonham in the suit. Grant’s motion for leave sought to add Bonham as a party to the suit on the\n\ngrounds that Bonham was Bennett’s alter ego, and his claims of intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress against both Bennett and Bonham “arose from the same transaction, occurrence, or series\n\nof transactions or occurrences . . . and the questions of law and fact in this case are common to both\n\n[Bennett and Bonham].” After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion without stating the\n\ngrounds for the joinder and ordered Grant to serve Bonham with process. After being served, Bonham\n\nanswered as a party to the suit without further objection. Later, after Bonham had entered an\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fappearance in the suit, Grant again amended his pleadings to add—after his indictments were\n\nexpunged—an additional counterclaim against Bennett and Bonham for malicious prosecution.\n\nBonham answered the malicious prosecution claim without objection.\n\n                On appeal, however, Bonham contends it was improperly joined in the lawsuit under\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 38. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 38. Rule 38 provides that a defendant may\n\nbring in a third party to a suit if that person is or may be liable to him or the plaintiff for all or part\n\nof the plaintiff’s claim against him. Id. A third-party action under Rule 38 is not an independent\n\ncause of action but is derivative of the plaintiff’s claim. Id.; see In re Seven-O Corp., 289 S.W.3d\n\n384, 390 (Tex. App.—Waco 2009, orig. proceeding [mand. denied]). Here, we agree with Bonham\n\nthat Grant’s claim asserting an independent cause of action against it for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress was not a third-party claim as contemplated by Rule 38. Grant did not assert—as\n\nRule 38 requires—that Bonham was liable for all or part of Bennett’s slander claim against him.\n\nRather, Grant sought to join Bonham as an additional party to his counterclaim seeking affirmative\n\nrelief for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n                We cannot, however, conclude that Bonham has proven the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing the joinder because our rules of civil procedure otherwise permit the joinder\n\nof a non-party to a previously filed counterclaim. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 97 provides that\n\nadditional persons—other than those made parties to the original action—may be made parties to\n\na counterclaim in accordance with the provisions of Rule 39 (“Joinder of Persons Needed for Just\n\nAdjudication”) and Rule 40 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). See Tex. R. Civ. P. 39, 40, 97(f);\n\nsee also Tex. R. Civ. P. 37 (“Before a case is called to trial, additional parties necessary or proper\n\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fparties to the suit, may be brought in, either by the plaintiff or the defendant upon such terms as the\n\ncourt may prescribe.”). Thus, non-parties must be joined as additional defendants to a counterclaim\n\nif in their absence complete relief cannot be afforded among the parties. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 39,\n\n97(f). In addition, the trial court has the discretion to permit the joinder of additional defendants to\n\na counterclaim under the permissive joinder provisions of Rule 40. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 40 (“All\n\npersons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally,\n\nor in the alternative any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence,\n\nor series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will\n\narise in the action”), 97(f) (persons other than those made parties to the original action may be made\n\nparties to a counterclaim in accordance with the provisions of Rule 40).11\n\n                Further, we note that once Bonham entered an appearance in this suit, Grant was\n\nentitled to assert his additional counterclaim against Bonham for malicious prosecution without\n\nfurther service of process. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 97(b), 124. Under these circumstances, we cannot\n\nconclude—nor has Bonham proven—that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the\n\njoinder. See Varme, 881 S.W.2d at 883 (“We emphasize that the trial court is given great discretion\n\nover joinder questions.”). Accordingly, we overrule Bonham’s joinder arguments.12\n\n        11\n          On rehearing, the Appellants contend they had no notice that Grant was seeking to join\nBonham under permissive venue. Grant’s motion for leave sought to add Bonham as a party to his\ncounterclaim and tracked the language of the permissive joinder rule. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 40.\n        12\n           Bonham hints in its brief that “Grant’s claims against the Corporation were thinly veiled—yet\nultimately successful—efforts to avoid limitations.” The statute of limitations issue was not submitted\nin the jury charge, and Bonham does not assert in an issue on appeal that the evidence conclusively\nproves Grant’s claims were barred by limitations. Nor does Bonham appeal any ruling it sought with\nsufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of its limitations complaint. We need not address\nthe merits of the limitations issue.\n\n                                                    22\n\fB.     Corporate Liability\n\n               In its second individual issue, Bonham contends there is no evidence to support\n\nthe jury’s finding of corporate liability. Corporations can act only through human agents, and\n\nwhen “actions are taken by a vice-principal of a corporation, those acts may be deemed to be the\n\nacts of the corporation itself.” See GTE Sw., Inc. v. Bruce, 998 S.W.2d 605, 618 (Tex. 1999); see\n\nalso Qwest Int’l Commc’ns, Inc. v. AT&T Corp., 167 S.W.3d 324, 326 (Tex. 2005) (corporation is\n\nliable for exemplary damages if it acts with malice through the actions of a vice-principal). A\n\ncorporation, however, cannot be liable for damages “if the vice-principal’s misconduct occurred\n\nwhile he was acting in a personal capacity unrelated to his authority as a corporate vice-principal.”\n\nBennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 884. A vice-principal of a corporation is a person who “represents the\n\ncorporation in its corporate capacity, and includes persons who have authority to employ, direct, and\n\ndischarge servants of the master, and those to whom a master has confided the management of the\n\nwhole or a division of his business.” Id. at 883.\n\n               Regarding Bennett’s relationship with Bonham, the Texas Supreme Court in Bennett I\n\nconcluded that Bennett was “indisputably a vice-principal of the Bonham Corporation, he was most\n\nlikely the only vice-principal and the only person whose conduct and decisions could subject the\n\ncorporation to exemplary damages.” Id. at 884. In this case, similar evidence was presented that,\n\nalthough Bonham was putatively owned by Bennett’s daughters, the daughters had no control over\n\nthe corporation and received no profits, and Bennett himself exclusively controlled and profited from\n\nBonham. Bennett testified that he did not own a home or a vehicle and did not have a bank account\n\nbut lived rent-free in a home owned by Bonham, drove Bonham vehicles, and “did whatever [he]\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fwanted to with the corporation bank account.” On this record, Bonham concedes that Bennett was\n\nindisputably a vice-principal of Bonham. Instead, Bonham argues only that there is insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that Bennett was acting in his capacity as a vice-principal of\n\nBonham when he maliciously prosecuted Grant.\n\n               In its brief, Bonham attempts to distinguish this case from Bennett I, in which the\n\nTexas Supreme Court found there was “ample evidence” that Bennett was acting in his corporate\n\ncapacity when he converted Reynolds’ cattle using “corporate authority over corporate employees,\n\non corporate land, [and] using corporate equipment.” Id. at 885. Bonham argues in its brief that in\n\ncontrast to Bennett I, “the instant case does not involve the use of corporate property or the exercise\n\nof corporate privileges to accomplish the underlying tort.” We conclude, however, that in this case\n\nthere is, again, more than ample evidence to impart corporate liability on Bonham.\n\n               Reviewing the record, Bennett’s malicious prosecution of Grant involved several\n\ncourses of conduct that implicate Bonham. First, Bennett contacted an attorney who had an ongoing\n\nattorney-client relationship with Bonham and directed him to research whether Grant’s alleged\n\nactions constituted a criminal offense. The attorney then drafted a brief based on his legal research\n\nadvocating that Grant be charged with attempted theft. The brief was sent to the Navarro district\n\nattorney and described as a “catalyst” in the district attorney’s decision to bring the case before a\n\ngrand jury. This same attorney was also pivotal in later advising Bennett to seek the appointment\n\nof a special prosecutor to the case and then drafted the petition accusing the Navarro County district\n\nattorney of bias. The attorney testified at trial that he had an ongoing attorney-client relationship\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fwith Bonham since 1982. When asked whether he had ever done any personal work for Bennett, the\n\nattorney answered: “I don’t remember ever doing anything for Mr. Bennett except a will one time.”\n\n               Bennett’s malicious prosecution of Grant was further accomplished by traveling many\n\nmiles in a Bonham vehicle to meet with officials in four different counties to have Grant prosecuted.\n\nBennett testified at trial that he did not own a vehicle and acknowledged that he used Bonham\n\nvehicles to accomplish this phase of the malicious prosecution. When asked whether he ever used\n\nBonham’s vehicles for personal use, Bennett responded “I don’t have much personal business.”\n\nBennett’s lack of personal business was further exemplified when he testified that he directed a\n\nBonham employee to type a transcript of his alleged secretly-taped conversation with Grant. He\n\nthen testified that he presented this typed transcript to law enforcement in his attempts to prosecute\n\nGrant. The employee who typed the transcript served as Bonham’s corporate representative at trial.”13\n\n               Viewing the foregoing evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we\n\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s finding that Bennett was\n\nacting in his capacity as a vice-principal of Bonham when he maliciously prosecuted Grant.14 We\n\noverrule Bonham’s individual issues on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n           We also note that the Navarro County district attorney testified that he had formed the\nimpression that Bennett was attempting to prosecute Grant in order to influence civil litigation\narising from this case. The jury further heard testimony that Grant was the “star witness” in the\nReynolds’ civil suit against both Bonham and Bennett, which eventually resulted in a $1 million\npunitive damages award against Bonham.\n       14\n           The jury alternatively found that Bonham was liable for Bennett’s malicious prosecution\nof Grant based on agency and reverse-piercing theories. We do not address Bonham’s challenges\nto these findings, as we have already concluded there was sufficient evidence to impart corporate\nliability on Bonham as a vice-principal.\n\n                                                 25\n\f                                           DAMAGES\n\n               After finding Bennett and the Bonham Corporation maliciously prosecuted Grant,\n\nthe jury found Grant was entitled to the following damages: $5,000 in mental anguish damages;\n\n$60,000 in attorneys’ fees incurred defending the malicious prosecution; $1 million in punitive\n\ndamages awarded against Bennett; and another $1 million in punitive damages awarded against the\n\nBonham Corporation. The trial court’s final judgment reduced the award of compensatory damages\n\nto $10,703 but awarded Grant, in accordance with the jury’s verdict, $2 million in punitive damages.\n\nAppellants challenge the entire award. We will begin by reviewing the compensatory damages\n\nawarded to Grant, which are comprised of $5,000 for mental anguish damages and $5,703 in\n\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n\nA.     Mental Anguish\n\n               Appellants first contend there is no evidence to support the trial court’s award of\n\n$5,000 in mental anguish damages. Although Grant was indicted and arrested as a result of their\n\nmalicious prosecution, Appellants challenge the mental anguish damages contending there is\n\ninsufficient evidence Grant suffered the “high degree of mental pain and distress necessary for\n\ncompensable mental anguish.” To support an award of mental anguish damages, there must be both\n\nevidence of the existence of compensable mental anguish damages and evidence to justify the\n\namount awarded. Hancock v. Variyam, 400 S.W.3d 59, 68 (Tex. 2013). Mental anguish is only\n\ncompensable if it causes a “substantial disruption in daily routine” or “a high degree of mental pain\n\nand distress.” Id.; Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f               Regarding Grant’s mental anguish damages, Grant testified that—long before his\n\nindictment—he “knew Bennett would come after [him]” for turning his photos over to the authorities.\n\nFearful “for [his] life and [his] family,” Grant testified he moved four times in an effort to keep his\n\nfamily safe from Bennett. Each time he would move, however, Grant testified that Bennett would\n\nshow up at depositions with his tape recorder and pencil in hand to record Grant’s new address. At\n\none such deposition taken prior to his indictment, Grant testified that he heard Bennett avow that “he\n\nwould see me go to the penitentiary.” He further testified that he was aware of other instances when\n\nBennett “had seen that people went to prison” and believed Bennett was “fully capable of seeing that\n\n[he] went to prison.” After hearing Bennett’s testimony that it was his goal to put him in prison,\n\nGrant testified he was fearful to leave home and would lock himself in his house to protect his\n\nfamily. When Grant was finally indicted, his lawyer informed him he had been charged with a\n\nfelony and was facing prison time. Grant and his mother then drove the three and half hours from\n\nColeman, Texas, where he lived, to Corsicana, Texas, where he had been indicted. Grant surrendered\n\nhimself to the authorities in Corsicana and was released that day on a surety bond posted by his\n\nmother. For the next nine months, the charges remained pending against Grant. Grant testified that\n\nhe worried how his family would be taken care of if he went to prison and that he was afraid to leave\n\nhis family alone. He further testified that as a result of worrying about what Bennett was going to\n\ndo, “I would have bad headaches, weak stomach, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep.” Grant additionally\n\ntestified that the experience affected his mental state as he went from being “a happy-go-lucky”\n\nperson to feeling like a “completely different person” who struggled with self-esteem and distanced\n\nhimself from friends and family. Grant’s sister confirmed that she noticed a change in Grant’s\n\ndemeanor, testifying that her brother “just closed himself and sequestered himself from everyone.”\n\n                                                  27\n\f               Based on the foregoing, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding that Grant suffered the degree of mental pain and distress that will support an award of mental\n\nanguish damages and that the award of $5,000 was well within the range supported by the evidence.\n\n\nB.     Attorneys’ Fees\n\n               When a defendant has caused attorneys’ fees to be incurred in defense of a criminal\n\ncharge which was maliciously prosecuted, attorneys’ fees in defending the prior criminal charge are\n\nrecoverable in the malicious prosecution suit as damages. See IBP, Inc. v. Klumpe, 101 S.W.3d 461,\n\n478 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, pet. denied). Here, Grant was charged with two felonies: attempted\n\nbribery and tampering with a witness. In his pleadings and at trial, however, Grant sued for malicious\n\nprosecution based on the attempted bribery charge only. With regard to recovering attorneys’ fees\n\nfor the malicious prosecution as damages, Grant’s attorney testified at trial that Grant incurred\n\n$6,003.19 in attorneys’ fees for defending against both charges, but that 95% of the work—or\n\n$5,703—would have been necessary for defending the attempted bribery charge alone. The jury,\n\nhowever, found Grant incurred $60,000 in reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees defending\n\nagainst the malicious prosecution. The trial court, in accordance with Grant’s voluntary remittitur,\n\nreduced this amount to $5,703 to conform to the evidence at trial. Appellants nevertheless contend\n\nthere is insufficient evidence to support the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded as damages.\n\n               Appellants do not challenge the reasonableness of the fees. Rather, they argue only\n\nthat a “reasonable fact-finder could not have . . . allocated 95 percent of the fees incurred on both\n\ncharges solely to attempted bribery.” We disagree. Submitting to the jury an attorney’s testimony\n\nconcerning the percentage of hours relating to specific claims—even a percentage a high as 95%—is\n\n                                                  28\n\fsufficient to satisfy a party’s burden to segregate its attorneys’ fees. See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P.\n\nv. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 314 (Tex. 2006) (“an opinion would have sufficed stating that, for\n\nexample, 95 percent of their drafting time would have been necessary even if there had been no\n\n[non-recoverable] claim”). Further, to the extent attorneys’ fees “would have been incurred on a\n\nrecoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply because they do double service” with a\n\nnon-recoverable claim. See id. at 313. Grant’s indictments were based on the same facts and he\n\nasserted the same defense of limitations to both charges. His attorney testified that the legal work\n\nperformed for both charges was essentially the same, as he drafted the same motions, conducted the\n\nsame discovery, and attended the same hearings and meetings for both charges. As such, the attorney\n\ntestified “that 95% of the work that was required on those two charges would’ve been necessary on\n\njust the attempted bribery charge itself alone. . . . I would have done the same work on the attempted\n\nbribery charge even if there hadn’t been the attempted tampering with a witness charge.” As there\n\nwas sufficient evidence that Grant would have incurred $5,703 in attorneys’ fees on the bribery\n\ncharge alone, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the damages award. Finding\n\nsufficient evidence to support the award of actual damages, we overrule Appellants’ second issue\n\non appeal.\n\n\nC.     Exemplary Damages Cap\n\n               The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code limits the maximum amount of\n\nexemplary damages a trial court can award. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.008(b). The cap,\n\nhowever, does not apply when a plaintiff seeks recovery of exemplary damages based on certain\n\nfelony criminal conduct enumerated under the statute, i.e., cap-busting conduct. Id. § 41.008(c).\n\n                                                 29\n\fOne such felony cap-busting exception—defined under Penal Code § 32.46—is when a person,\n\nwith the intent to defraud or harm any person, by deception causes another to sign or execute\n\nany document affecting the pecuniary interest of any person in the amount of $1,500 or more.\n\nId. § 41.008(c)(11); see also Tex. Penal Code § 32.46. Here, the jury made a cap-busting finding\n\nthat the Appellants, with the intent to harm Grant, caused another by deception to sign or execute\n\nhis criminal indictment for attempted bribery, and the indictment affected Grant’s pecuniary interest\n\nin the amount of $1,500 or more. Appellants contend there is legally insufficient evidence to support\n\nthis finding because: (1) an indictment is not a document affecting the pecuniary interest of any\n\nperson; and (2) there is no evidence Bennett caused anyone to sign the indictment.\n\n\n               1.      Document Affecting Pecuniary Interest\n\n               Appellants first contend that indictments—as a matter of law—are not documents\n\nthat affect a defendant’s pecuniary interest, and therefore Grant cannot qualify for the cap-busting\n\nexception. We are not persuaded by Appellants’ argument. The term “pecuniary interest” is not\n\ndefined by the statute; therefore, courts have defined the term using its common meaning of having a\n\n“financial stake” in a matter. See Briones v. State, 76 S.W.3d 591, 595 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2002, no pet.); Goldstein v. State, 803 S.W.2d 777, 791 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, pet. ref’d).\n\nTherefore, the narrow question presented is whether there is legally sufficient evidence of Grant\n\nhaving a financial stake in the grand jury’s indictment.\n\n               Appellants contend that Grant had no financial stake because indictments as a whole\n\nare excluded from the class of documents that affect pecuniary interests because—unlike a “bank\n\ndraft, a promissory note, [or] a deed”—no monetary interest “flow[s] directly from the document.”\n\n                                                 30\n\fThe statute, however, does not require the complainant to have a pecuniary interest in the document\n\nitself. See Lewis v. State, No. 05-09-00299-CR, 2010 WL 4400515, at *4 (Tex. App.—Dallas Nov.\n\n8, 2010, pet. ref’d) (not designated for publication). Rather, it requires only that the execution of\n\nthe document affect the pecuniary interest of any person. See Tex. Penal Code § 32.46. Further, a\n\ncomplainant is not required under the statute to prove actual pecuniary loss. See Smith v. State, 681\n\nS.W.2d 71, 75–76 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1983), aff’d, 722 S.W.2d 408 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1986) (offense complete when person causes another to execute document with intent to defraud\n\nor harm; there is no requirement to prove resulting harm). Therefore, when a person purposely\n\nuses deception to cause a court official to execute a document, the executed document may\n\naffect pecuniary interests if it subjects a person to potential financial liability. See Fisher v. State,\n\n803 S.W.2d 828, 830 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1991, pet. ref’d) (securing issuance of citation through\n\ndeception affected pecuniary interests as citation made defendant in suit potentially liable for\n\nmonetary damages); Woodley v. State, No. 08-00-00470-CR, 2003 WL 550298, at *6 (Tex.\n\nApp.—El Paso 2003, pet. ref’d) (mem. op.) (securing trial court’s execution of agreed judgment that\n\nhad been altered to add new defendant and increase amount of award affected pecuniary interests as\n\ndefendants faced potential liability under altered judgment).\n\n                Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s finding, we conclude\n\nthere is more than a scintilla of evidence that Grant’s pecuniary or financial interests were affected\n\nby the indictment, which—on its face—required him to find a means to post a $10,000 bond or face\n\nimmediate and indefinite imprisonment. He then was required to obtain legal counsel to quash the\n\nindictment, incurring an additional $5,703 in attorneys’ fees. Further, if convicted of the offense of\n\n\n\n                                                   31\n\fattempted bribery, Grant faced further potential liability as the offense carried a monetary penalty\n\nof up to $10,000. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34; 15.01; 36.02. Thus, we conclude there is legally\n\nsufficient evidence Grant had a financial stake in the indictment, as the execution of the document\n\ncaused him both immediate financial liability and potential financial liability in the future.\n\n\n                2.      Causation\n\n                Appellants next contend that Bennett cannot be the legal cause of Grant’s indictment\n\nbecause (1) the causal link between Bennett’s actions and the indictment is too attenuated to\n\nsatisfy causation requirements under the Penal Code; and (2) it is impossible to prove causation\n\nbecause “grand jury proceedings are secret, so there is no way of knowing which evidence\n\npersuaded the grand jury to indict.” Criminal liability is predicated on but-for causation but also\n\nrequires consideration of the foreseeability of the injurious consequences of the defendant’s conduct.\n\nWilliams v. State, 235 S.W.3d 742, 764–65 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Appellants, relying on the\n\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals’ discussion of causation in Williams v. State, argue the chain of\n\ncausation linking Bennett to the indictment is too attenuated to impose criminal responsibility. In\n\nWilliams, the Court found that a mother who left her two daughters in a room with a lit candle under\n\nanother adult’s supervision was not criminally responsible for the children’s burning deaths because\n\nit was not reasonably foreseeable: (1) that the other adult would forget to blow the candle out before\n\nfalling asleep; (2) that a sheet or clothing would then fall on the burning candle; and (3) that the\n\nother adult would not be able to get children out of the house after the fire started. Id. In this excerpt\n\nfrom their brief, Appellants argue the following is the but-for causal chain linking Bennett to\n\nGrant’s indictment in this case:\n\n                                                   32\n\f       •       If Bennett had not asked for a special prosecutor, and\n\n       •       If Bennett had not given the prosecutor the facts he had gathered, and\n\n       •       If the prosecutor had not brought the case to the grand jury, and possibly,\n\n       •       If the prosecutor had not presented those facts, and, possibly,\n\n       •       If the grand jury had not relied on those facts, and\n\n       •       If the prosecutor had not recommended an indictment or the grand jury had not\n               disregarded the prosecutor’s recommendation, and\n\n       •       If at least nine of the grand jurors had not voted to issue the indictment,\n\n       •       Then Grant never would have been indicted.\n\n\nAppellants then argue this causal chain is similar to Williams because it “is too disconnected from\n\nthe putative cause to support any finding” of causation. What Appellants fail to account for, however,\n\nis that the Court in Williams found that causal link insufficient because the events leading to the\n\nchildren’s deaths were “not reasonably foreseeable.” Id. at 765 (emphasis added). The facts of\n\nthis case are much different. The evidence in this case reflects that Bennett set out on a course of\n\nconduct to have Grant indicted and was successful in that endeavor. Indeed, Appellants do not\n\ncontest the jury’s finding that Bennett intended to harm Grant by causing the grand jury to sign his\n\nindictment. It is reasonably foreseeable that if Bennett intended to put Grant in prison, then provided\n\nevidence that a reasonable juror could infer was fabricated or manipulated, and then led a campaign\n\nto have a special prosecutor appointed in the case—all of which is more than adequately supported\n\nby the record—the end result of these efforts would be Grant’s indictment. It is abundantly apparent\n\nthat Grant’s indictment was the natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of Bennett’s actions.\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\f               Appellants next contend that “Grant could not have sustained his burden to prove\n\ncausation because it is impossible to show that Bennett’s conduct was necessary for the indictment\n\nto issue [given that] grand jury proceedings are secret.” First, as we have already discussed, there\n\nwas sufficient evidence that but for Bennett’s aggressive and untoward efforts to improperly\n\ninfluence the criminal justice system, the case would have never been put before the grand jury,\n\nnot once, but twice. Further, Bennett does not dispute the jury’s finding that he used deception to\n\ncause the grand jury to execute the indictment. Deception is defined, as “creating or confirming by\n\nwords or conduct a false impression of law or fact that is likely to affect the judgment of another\n\nin the transaction, and that the actor does not believe is true.” Tex. Penal Code §§ 31.01(1)(A),\n\n32.46(d)(1). Here, the special prosecutor testified candidly that he had the following evidence\n\nfrom Bennett—at the time he presented the indictments—from which the jury found Bennett used\n\ndeception to create a false impression that was likely to affect the judgment of another: Bennett’s\n\nstatements that Grant had called trying to sell him incriminating photos for $5,000 and a transcript\n\nfrom Bennett—which the jury could have found was fraudulent—purportedly transcribing a secretly-\n\ntaped conversation with Grant that substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant had sought $5,000 for\n\nthe photos. The record further reflects that Bennett testified at the grand jury proceeding but that\n\nGrant was not present. In exact accordance with Bennett’s evidence, the grand jury’s indictment\n\ncharges that Grant “with the specific intent to commit the offense of bribery, called [Bennett], with\n\nthe purpose of soliciting a bribe of $5,000.”\n\n               Under the Penal Code, “a person is criminally responsible if the result would not\n\nhave occurred but for his conduct, operating either alone or concurrently with another cause,\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\funless the concurrent cause was clearly sufficient to produce the result and the conduct of the actor\n\nclearly insufficient.” Tex. Penal Code § 6.04. Here, Appellants do not challenge the jury’s finding\n\nthat Bennett used deception to indict Grant, and the allegations in the indictment identically mirror\n\nthe evidence provided by Bennett. Under this record, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s\n\nfinding of causation, there is more than a scintilla of evidence in the record that Bennett’s conduct\n\nalone was sufficient to have caused the indictment and to incur criminal responsibility. See id.\n\nHaving found sufficient evidence to support the jury’s cap-busting finding, we overrule Appellants’\n\nthird issue on appeal.\n\n\nD.      Constitutionality of Exemplary Damages\n\n                Appellants lastly attack the award of exemplary damages, contending the dual\n\n$1 million exemplary damages awards against Bennett and the Bonham Corporation violate their\n\nfederal substantive due process rights. While state law governs the amount properly awarded as\n\nexemplary damages, that amount is also subject to an ultimate federal constitutional check for\n\nexorbitancy. Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 307. This is because the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from imposing a “grossly excessive” punishment on a\n\ntortfeasor. BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 562 (1996). But punitive damages “may\n\nproperly be imposed to further a State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and\n\ndeterring its repetition,” and “States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the\n\nlevel of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case.”\n\nId. at 568. “Only when an award can be categorized as grossly excessive in relation to these interests\n\ndoes it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates” due process. Id.\n\n                                                   35\n\f               In this case, the State has a legitimate interest in both punishing individuals who\n\npurposely manipulate the legal system to imprison innocent persons and in deterring its repetition.\n\nWe must therefore determine whether the punitive damages award in this case was grossly excessive\n\nin relation to these interests. See id. In determining whether an award is excessive, the United States\n\nSupreme Court has identified three “guideposts” by which we must assess the constitutionality of\n\nthe punitive damages award:\n\n\n       1.      the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct;\n\n       2.      the disparity between the actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and\n               the punitive damages award; and\n\n       3.      the difference between the punitive damages awarded by the jury and the civil\n               penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.\n\n\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 418 (2003); see also Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d\n\nat 873. Whether a punitive damages award passes constitutional muster under this standard is a\n\nquestion of law that we review de novo. Bunton v. Bentley, 153 S.W.3d 50, 54 (Tex. 2004).\n\n\n       1.      Reprehensibility of Bennett’s Misconduct\n\n               The first guidepost, the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct,\n\nfocuses on the “enormity” of the misconduct and is “the most important indicium of the reasonableness\n\nof a punitive damages award.” BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 575. Punitive damages are not\n\ncompensation for injury; rather, they operate as private fines intended to punish the defendant and\n\nto deter future wrongdoing. Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., 532 U.S.424, 432\n\n(2001). Exemplary damages should therefore reflect the “enormity of [the] offense.” BMW of N. Am.,\n\n                                                  36\n\f517 U.S. at 575. In evaluating the enormity of a person’s misconduct, we consider five nonexclusive\n\nfactors— whether:\n\n\n       1.      The harm inflicted was physical rather than economic;\n\n       2.      The tortious conduct showed an indifference to or reckless disregard for the\n               health or safety of others;\n\n       3.      The target of the conduct had financial vulnerability;\n\n       4.      The conduct involved repeated actions, not just an isolated incident; and\n\n       5.      The harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, as opposed to\n               mere accident.\n\n\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538 U.S. at 419. One of these reprehensibility factors alone “may\n\nnot be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any\n\naward suspect.” Id.\n\n\n               a.      Harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery or deceit.\n\n               Appellants concede there is evidence that Grant’s indictment resulted from “intentional\n\nmalice, trickery, or deceit” but argue that none of the other factors weigh in favor of punitive\n\ndamages. We certainly agree with Appellants that the fifth reprehensibility factor weighs in favor\n\nof punitive damages. The jury heard evidence that Bennett’s goal was to put Grant in prison to settle\n\na personal vendetta and to influence pending civil litigation, and that he set out on a campaign of\n\nlegal thuggery—including allegations of lying, tailoring evidence, and even outright fabrication of\n\nevidence—to ensure that Grant was imprisoned. When Bennett could not win at this game, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\frecord reflects he decided to change the playing field by exerting political pressure on a district\n\nattorney to appoint his own hand-picked special prosecutor to the case.\n\n                Further, when considering exemplary damages, we may examine Bennett’s misconduct\n\nbeyond the malicious prosecution itself when it “demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability”\n\nof his actions and bears “a nexus to the specific harm suffered” by Grant. Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d\n\nat 875. Here, Bennett’s efforts to manipulate the legal system to imprison Grant were part of a\n\nlarger escapade designed to thwart justice and abuse the court system. We conclude the following\n\nallegations of malfeasance may properly inform the reprehensibility analysis, as they demonstrate\n\nthe deliberateness, culpability, and motive behind Bennett’s actions and relate back to the underlying\n\nmalicious prosecution:\n\n       Urging Grant to Lie and Attempting to Bribe Him. Grant testified that, prior to turning his\nphotos over to the authorities, Bennett visited his home and urged him to lie about what he had seen.\nGrant’s sister testified that Bennett then attempted to offer Grant a lucrative job under the guise of\nhelping his family after a car accident. She testified Bennett offered that if Grant “can come and help\nhim for a couple of days, he had a job that he can get $4,000 for . . . a couple of days of work.”\nWhen Grant had worked for Bennett the previous year, his salary was $1,100 a month. At the time\nBennett offered this money, Grant was posed to be the star witness testifying against Bennett in his\ncriminal trial for cattle theft and in Reynolds’ civil suit.\n\n         Threatening Grant. When money was not enough to persuade Grant, there was evidence at\ntrial that Bennett then tried a new tactic to silence Grant. Grant’s sister testified that Bennett called\nher more than 15 times trying to obtain Grant’s new contact information. Frustrated that Bennett\nwould not stop calling, the sister provided Bennett with her husband’s cell phone number and\nsaid it was Grant’s number. Bennett testified that he then asked Rogers to call the number. Shortly\nthereafter, Rogers called the number and reached Grant’s brother-in-law. Believing he was speaking\nto Grant, Rogers then—according to the brother-in-law—demanded that Grant turn over the pictures\nand threatened “if he didn’t get the pictures, that he had a jake-leg lawyer that would obtain them”\nand “that he was going to take care of [Grant] one way or the other.” The brother-in-law testified\nthat he relayed these threats to Grant.\n\n        Litigation Against Grant. Being unsuccessful in silencing Grant, Bennett then filed this suit\nalleging Grant had slandered him by saying that he had stolen Reynolds’ cattle and sought $50,000\n\n                                                   38\n\fin damages. The jury found against Bennett on his slander claim, finding that Grant’s statement that\nBennett had stolen from Reynolds was substantially true. In addition to this suit, Bennett filed—the\nday after Grant’s criminal record was expunged—a second civil lawsuit against Grant and others\nalleging they had conspired to have him indicted for cattle theft. Bennett sought $2 million dollars\nin compensatory damages, in addition to punitive damages, in that suit.15\n\n        Pressuring Grant’s Attorney to Resign. During the course of this litigation, Bennett filed two\ngrievances against Grant’s attorney that were dismissed as not alleging professional misconduct. In\naddition to the grievances, Bennett sued Grant’s lawyer, contending he had conspired with Grant and\nothers to have him indicted for cattle theft. The attorney testified that after he was sued by Bennett\nfor $2 million, he was “angry” and “scared” and decided to no longer represent Grant in this suit\nbecause “he couldn’t do as good a job as somebody that wasn’t being sued themselves.”\n\n        Tampering With Evidence. At trial, there were allegations that one of the photos Grant had\ntaken depicted Reynolds’ brand on the sold cattle. There were further allegations that Bennett had\ndoctored this photo during his criminal trial to change the incriminating image of his neighbor’s\nbrand and conceal his theft. In addition, the San Saba District and County Clerk testified that\nBennett attempted to register Reynolds’ brand as his own. Finally, during the course of this trial,\nBennett—outside the presence of the jury and without permission from the trial court—altered an\nexhibit depicting a hand-drawn diagram of Reynolds’ brand. We conclude these cover-up efforts show\nculpability and deliberateness and sought to extend and exacerbate harm to Grant by discrediting\nhim as a witness and bolstering Bennett’s claims in his civil lawsuits against Grant.16\n\n\n               b.      Harm inflicted was not merely an economic injury and showed a reckless\n                       disregard for Grant’s health and safety.\n\n               Regarding the first and second reprehensibility factors, Appellants argue Grant\n\nsuffered a purely economic injury and this is not a case involving physical harm warranting a\n\ngreater award of exemplary damages, and that his actions do not show an indifference to or\n\n\n\n       15\n          Grant, Reynolds, and Miller obtained a favorable summary judgment and sanctions against\nBennett, Bonham, and their attorney in that suit, which is currently pending on appeal before this\nCourt in Bennett, Bonham & Paris v. Reynolds, No. 03-12-00568.\n       16\n          An award of punitive damages for some of these actions has already been awarded against\nBennett in Bennett I. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 876. In that suit, however, he was punished for\nhow his actions affected Reynolds. In this suit, the award of punitive damages is to punish Bennett\nfor how these actions affected Grant. See id.\n\n                                                 39\n\freckless disregard for Grant’s health or safety. We disagree. Malicious prosecution is not a purely\n\neconomic injury; rather, the Restatement recognizes that a plaintiff may recover for the physical\n\nharm caused by reason of his arrest. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 671 (1977). Here, Bennett\n\ndid not intend to inflict a mere financial injury on Grant; rather, he succeeded in having Grant’s\n\nactual person seized, held in captivity, and stripped of personal liberties. Appellants further contend\n\nthat: “Bennett’s mere desire that Grant serve prison time does not equate to indifference or reckless\n\ndisregard for Grant’s health or safety. . . . At best, this factor is neutral and therefore carries no\n\nweight in the reprehensibility analysis.” We are confident that if Bennett himself or any person\n\nwere arrested and facing a prison sentence in Texas, he would not view his health and safety\n\nneutrally affected. See also id. (maliciously prosecuted plaintiff may recover for impairment to\n\nhealth sustained from arrest).\n\n\n               c.      Target of the conduct had financial vulnerability.\n\n               Regarding the third reprehensibility factor, we note that Bennett’s actions were further\n\nreprehensible because Bennett was aware that Grant and his family were financially vulnerable.\n\nGrant testified he first met Bennett because he was desperate for work, and Bennett agreed to hire\n\nhim as a hand. During the time Grant worked for Bennett, the Bonham Corporation paid him a\n\nsalary of $1,100 for a full month of work and allowed him to live in a trailer on the property. A\n\nsalary of $13,200 a year, even when the housing allowance is considered, was hovering on the\n\nfederal poverty line.17 Further, Grant’s financial situation worsened when his wife and baby were\n\n\n       17\n           Pursuant to federal poverty guidelines in 2001, a person with two dependents was poverty-\nstricken if his annual income was less than $14,630. See http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/01poverty.htm.\n\n                                                  40\n\fin a major traffic accident shortly after Grant turned his photos over to the authorities. Grant and\n\nothers testified that both his wife and baby were hospitalized after the accident, that his wife had\n\nbeen permanently injured, and that Grant had to take a significant amount of time off from work to\n\nstay home and care for her. The record reflects that Bennett was fully aware of the car accident and\n\nperhaps attempted to use the situation to take advantage of Grant’s financial vulnerability by offering\n\nhim an extremely lucrative job immediately after the accident under the guise of helping Grant’s\n\nfamily. Amidst this backdrop of financial vulnerability, Bennett then began his quest to have Grant\n\nimprisoned and ultimately indicted. Further, Grant’s indictment carried a prison sentence of two to\n\nten years’ imprisonment. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34, 15.01, 36.02. Undoubtedly, Bennett’s\n\nactions threatened to financially ruin Grant and his family.\n\n                In sum, we conclude four of the five reprehensibility factors are present in this case\n\nand weigh in favor of punitive damages: (1) the harm to Grant resulted from intentional malice,\n\ntrickery, or deceit; (2) Bennett’s malicious prosecution of Grant was not merely an economic injury\n\nbut resulted in a seizure of Grant’s person and loss of physical liberties; (3) Bennett’s tortious\n\nconduct showed an indifference to and reckless disregard for Grant’s health and safety; (4) and his\n\nactions threatened to financially ruin Grant. Thus, all but one of the reprehensibility factors weigh\n\nin favor of exemplary damages.18\n\n\n\n\n       18\n           The remaining reprehensibility factor is whether the defendant’s conduct involved repeated\nactions, not just an isolated incident. For purposes of the reprehensibility analysis, the Texas Supreme\nCourt has found that this factor refers to recidivism and not a course of conduct resulting in a single\ninjury. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 878 n.55. Here, Grant alleges Bennett engaged in a course of\nconduct resulting in a single injury—his indictment for attempted bribery. There is no evidence in\nthe record that Bennett had engaged in other acts of malicious prosecution demonstrating recidivism.\n\n                                                  41\n\f       2.      Ratio Between Exemplary and Compensatory Damages\n\n               The second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an excessive punitive\n\ndamages award is the ratio between the punitive damages awarded and the actual or potential harm\n\ninflicted on the plaintiff. See BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 580. In analyzing this ratio, “the proper\n\ninquiry is ‘whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the\n\nharm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred.’”\n\nId. at 581 (quoting TXO Prod. Corp. v. Alliance Res. Corp., 509 U.S. 443, 460 (1993) (emphasis in\n\noriginal)). Thus, we are to examine the difference between the punitive damages award and the harm\n\nactually suffered and the harm “that would have ensued if the tortious plan had succeeded.” See id.;\n\nsee also TXO Prod., 509 U.S. at 460. While there is not “a mathematical bright line between the\n\nconstitutionally acceptable and constitutionally unacceptable [award of exemplary damages] that\n\nwould fit every case,” see Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 18 (1991), we have been\n\ninstructed that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio . . . will satisfy due process” and that an\n\n“award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of\n\nconstitutional impropriety.” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538 U.S. at 425.\n\n               Appellants contend that there is no meaningful distinction between this case and the\n\nlarge punitive damages award the Texas Supreme Court overturned in Bennett I, in which the Court\n\nfound that the ratio of $5,327.11 in actual damages compared to the $250,000 in exemplary damages\n\nawarded against Bennett—a ratio of 47:1—and the $1 million exemplary damages awarded against\n\nBonham—a ratio of 188:1—violated due process. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 869. As the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court has recognized, however, “a jury imposing a punitive damages award must make a\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fqualitative assessment based on a host of facts and circumstances unique to the particular case before\n\nit. Because no two cases are truly identical, meaningful comparisons of such awards are difficult to\n\nmake.” TXO Prod., 509 U.S. at 458. While this case and Bennett I share some nucleus of operative\n\nfacts, the present case is distinguishable and therefore must be examined on its own facts. In Bennett\n\nI, the jury found Bennett converted thirteen of his neighbor’s cattle and assessed actual damages at\n\nthe market value of the cattle, $5,327.11. Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 871. While the Court found that\n\nBennett’s malfeasance in attempting to cover-up his initial conversion showed heightened\n\nreprehensibility, it concluded:\n\n\n               At heart, though, this is an economic-injury, actual-harm case seeking\n        recovery for the conversion of thirteen head of cattle. Reynolds alleges a broader\n        “criminal escapade” that aimed to ruin him, but the theoretical possibilities of greater\n        harm strike as marginally relevant at best in assessing exemplary damages, absent\n        proof of the likelihood of such harms.\n\n\nId. at 877.\n\n                In striking contrast, Bennett in this case did not merely steal cattle; rather, he\n\nattempted to deprive a man of two to ten years of his liberty. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34, 15.01,\n\n36.02 (sentencing for offense of attempted bribery). While Appellants attempt to equate theft of\n\ncattle to the theft of years from a man’s life, there is no comparison between the two acts. This is\n\nreflected in the reprehensibility analysis, in which we concluded that four of the five reprehensibility\n\nfactors were present in this case. In contrast, in Bennett I, the Texas Supreme Court found that\n\nBennett inflicted a purely economic injury on his neighbor by stealing his cattle and therefore\n\nonly one of the reprehensibility factors—the harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery, or\n\ndeceit—was present. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 877.\n\n                                                  43\n\f               Further, and perhaps most important for our discussion, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nfound that Bennett I was an actual-harm case only—meaning that beyond the actual harm suffered\n\nby Reynolds from the theft of his cattle, there was only marginal evidence of any other potential\n\nharm faced by Reynolds or anyone else as a result of Bennett’s conversion. Id. Therefore, in\n\nBennett I, potential harm was not relevant in the Court’s ratio analysis. See id. But in this case, the\n\nevidence of potential harm is not marginal or speculative; rather, the record conclusively shows that\n\nGrant would have been imprisoned for two to ten years if Bennett had succeeded in his illicit\n\nscheme. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34, 15.01, 36.02. In analyzing the exemplary damages ratio in a\n\npotential-harm case, the U.S. Supreme Court has unequivocally instructed us that “[i]t is appropriate\n\nto consider the magnitude of the potential harm that the defendant’s conduct would have caused to\n\nits intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded.” TXO Prod., 509 U.S. at 460 (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (holding dramatic disparity between $19,000 compensatory damages award compared to\n\n$10 million exemplary damages award did not violate due process “in light of the [millions]\n\npotentially at stake” if the defendant “had succeeded in its illicit scheme”). Thus, U.S. Supreme Court\n\nprecedent requires us to compare the exemplary damages awarded in this case to both “the harm\n\nthat has actually occurred” and the potential harm that Grant would have sustained if Bennett’s\n\n“wrongful plan had succeeded.” See id.; see also BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 581 (“the proper\n\ninquiry is whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the\n\nharm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred”).\n\n               Appellants stress in their brief the disparity between the dual $1 million punitive\n\ndamages awarded in this case compared to the $10,703 compensatory damages award. That disparity\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\flessens, however, when we consider the potential prison sentence faced by Grant. Although it is\n\ndifficult to place a monetary value on the loss a person experiences from losing years of his life to\n\nan erroneous prison sentence, the State compensates persons who have been wrongfully convicted\n\nto the tune of $80,000 for each year of wrongful imprisonment plus lifetime annuity payments.\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 103.052 (Lump-Sum Compensation), 103.053 (Annuity\n\nCompensation). Thus, if Grant had been wrongfully imprisoned for the minimum sentence of two\n\nyears’ imprisonment, he would have been entitled at a bare minimum to a lump-sum payment of\n\n$160,000.19 And, on the high end of the spectrum, he would have been entitled to a lump-sum\n\npayment of $800,000 for serving the maximum ten-year sentence, plus potential lifetime annuity\n\npayments which could potentially push the final award to over $1 million.20 Although there is no\n\nway to precisely put a dollar value on the potential harm in this case, the State’s restitution payments\n\nreflect the value the Legislature has placed on a year of life lost to wrongful imprisonment and\n\nprovide a guidepost for the potential damages in this case.\n\n                Based on this analysis, we conclude the potential damages in this case can be\n\nprudently and rationally valued at a minimum of $160,000. This is the minimum amount Grant\n\nwould have received from the State if he had been wrongfully convicted of attempted bribery and\n\nserved the minimum sentence available. When combined with the actual damages, the total actual\n\n       19\n         Annuity payments would not begin until the first anniversary of this lump-sum payment\nand would be awarded only if Grant was still living on that date. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n§§ 103.151(b), 103.154(b).\n       20\n           The annuity payments are somewhat speculative as they are determined by the number\nof years a person survives after release from prison. See id. § 103.154(b). Unlike the lump-sum\ncompensation, the annuity payments do not transfer upon death to the person’s estate. See id.\n§§ 103.151(a), 103.154(b).\n\n                                                  45\n\fand potential damages for this case would therefore be at least $170,703. Using these figures, the\n\nratio between the actual and potential harm compared to the dual $1 million exemplary damages\n\nawards would be over 5:1 for both Bennett and Bonham. See BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 581 (“the\n\nproper inquiry is whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and\n\nthe harm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has\n\noccurred”). We note that—even with careful consideration of both the actual and potential damages\n\nin this case—this ratio likely exceeds constitutional limits. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538 U.S.\n\nat 425 (“award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the\n\nline of constitutional impropriety”). As such, this guidepost weighs in favor of reducing the punitive\n\ndamages award.\n\n\n       3.      Legislative Penalties for Similar Misconduct\n\n               The final guidepost compares the exemplary damages with legislatively authorized\n\ncivil penalties in comparable cases. This factor fortifies the notion that legislatures make policy and\n\nare well positioned to define and deter undesired behavior. Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 880. Here, we\n\nnote there is no comparable civil penalty for Bennett’s conduct. We may, however, also look to\n\ncriminal penalties that could be imposed, as “the existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing\n\non the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538\n\nU.S. at 428. When used to determine the dollar amount of an exemplary damages award, though,\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned us that criminal penalties have “less utility” than\n\ncivil penalties. See id.; see also Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 881. In this case, we conclude criminal\n\n\n\n\n                                                  46\n\fpenalties have some relevance to our discussion, as they demonstrate that Bennett had fair notice that\n\nhis conduct could subject him to the following punishment:\n\n\n        •       Tampering With or Fabricating Physical Evidence\n\n                •         2 to 10 Year Prison Sentence\n                •         $10,000 fine\n\n        •       Aggravated Perjury Before Grand Jury\n\n                •         2 to 10 Year Prison Sentence\n                •         $10,000 fine\n\n        •       Execution of a Document by Deception\n\n                •         180 days to 2 years in State Jail\n                •         $10,000 fine\n\n        •       Making a False Report to Peace Officer or Law Enforcement Employee\n\n                •         Up to 180 Days in State Jail\n                •         $2,000 fine\n                •         $16,000 fine for committing offense eight times21\n\n\nThus, Bennett had fair notice of the seriousness with which the State viewed his wrongful conduct,\n\nas his actions could subject him to up to $46,000 in monetary fines and four to twenty-two\n\nyears’ incarceration.22\n\n                Appellants contend in their brief that we should—as we did on remand from\n\nBennett I—reduce the exemplary damages award to the comparable criminal fines. In that case, we\n\n\n\n       21\n           Bennett acknowledged at trial that, in his efforts to prosecute Grant, he spoke with at least\neight different law enforcement officials on separate occasions.\n        22\n           See Tex. Penal Code §§ 32.46 (execution of document by deception), 38.03 (aggravated\nperjury), 37.09 (evidence tampering), 37.08 (false report).\n\n                                                    47\n\fconcluded that the criminal monetary sanction for cattle theft was comparable to the civil offense\n\nof conversion and provided an objective basis for setting a constitutionally permissible exemplary\n\ndamages award. Bennett v. Reynolds, No. 03-05-00034-CV, 2010 WL 4670270, at *5 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin Nov. 18, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.) supplemented, 03-05-00034-CV, 2011 WL 182876\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin Jan. 19, 2011, no pet.). In this case, however, there simply is no criminal offense\n\ncomparable to the civil offense of malicious prosecution. While we can examine specific criminal\n\nactions Bennett took in his ultimate effort to maliciously prosecute Grant, none of these offenses take\n\ninto account that Bennett’s ultimate goal was to put Grant in prison.23 We do, however, conclude\n\nthat under this record the applicable prison sentences and fines put Bennett on notice that the State\n\nhas a significant interest in deterring this type of conduct and would prosecute and imprison those\n\nwho attempt to manipulate the criminal justice system for personal gain.\n\n               After careful analysis of these three guideposts, we conclude: (1) four of the five\n\nreprehensibility factors weigh in favor of punitive damages; (2) potential harm is relevant in\n\nevaluating the ratio to exemplary damages, but that even when we consider potential harm, the\n\nresulting ratio of 5:1 likely exceeds constitutional boundaries; and (3) there are no comparable\n\ncivil sanctions, but Bennett was on notice that the State had a significant interest in protecting the\n\n\n\n\n       23\n             In truth, for most cases the monetary criminal penalties under the Texas Penal Code have\nlittle utility in determining the dollar value of an exemplary damages award. See State Farm Mut.\nAuto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 428 (2003). The monetary penalty for all felonies in Texas,\nexcept for capital felony offenses which do not carry any monetary penalty, is a fine not to exceed\n$10,000. Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.31–.35. There is no variance in the amount of the fine to account\nfor the State’s varied interests in preventing and punishing various degrees of reprehensible felony\nconduct.\n\n                                                  48\n\fintegrity of the criminal justice system and would vigorously prosecute, fine, and imprison persons\n\nwho engaged in such behavior.\n\n               Our remaining task is to determine—under the unique facts of this case and these\n\nguideposts—what amount of exemplary damages would pass constitutional muster. In this regard,\n\nwe have been instructed that an award “four times the amount of compensatory damages might\n\nbe close to the line of constitutional impropriety” and that “[p]ushing exemplary damages to the\n\nabsolute constitutional limit in a case like this leaves no room for greater punishment in cases\n\ninvolving death, grievous physical injury, financial ruin, or actions that endanger a large segment of\n\nthe public.” Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 308–310. While we find Bennett’s conduct\n\nabhorrent, we recognize that his actions did not actually cause any of these enumerated unfortunate\n\ncircumstances. We do, however, also recognize that the State has a significant interest in punishing\n\nand deterring this type of conduct and that Bennett’s actions were particularly reprehensible.\n\nWeighing these competing concerns, we conclude that a ratio of 3:1 exemplary damages compared\n\nto the combined actual and potential damages passes constitutional muster. This results in an award\n\nof $512,109 against each defendant (three times the actual and potential damages of $170,703) and\n\nreduces the total punitive damages award from $2 million to $1,024,218 ($512,109 against Bonham\n\nand $512,109 against Bennett).24 This award recognizes the potential harm caused by Bennett and\n\n\n\n\n       24\n          When corporate liability is warranted based on the actions of a vice-principal, the Texas\nSupreme Court has affirmed the propriety of awarding exemplary damages against both the individual\nvice-principal and his employer. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 869 (affirming exemplary damages\nawarded against both individual who was corporate principal and corporation itself but remanding\nbecause awards were excessive under due process); see also Qualicare of E. Tex., Inc. v. Runnels,\n863 S.W.2d 220, 224 (Eastland 1993—no writ.) (award of exemplary damages against both employer\nand vice-principal “is proper and does not impose a double punishment”).\n\n                                                 49\n\fBonham, their reprehensibility, and the State’s interest in punishing and deterring, but also leaves\n\nroom for greater punishment for cases with more egregious injuries.\n\n\n                                            SANCTIONS\n\n                In addition to the actual and exemplary damages at issue in this suit, Grant alleged\n\nBennett’s slander claim against him was frivolous and brought in bad faith for purposes of harassment\n\nand sought sanctions. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.001; Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. Bennett\n\noriginally initiated this suit—as discussed previously—by suing Grant for slander, alleging that\n\nGrant’s statement that Bennett had stolen Reynolds’ cattle was slanderous. The jury found that\n\nGrant’s statement was substantially true and this finding has not been challenged on appeal. The\n\ntrial court granted the request for sanctions and ordered Bennett to pay Grant’s attorneys’ fees\n\nincurred defending the claim in the amount of $269,644.50, concluding that this amount adequately\n\npunished Bennett and fairly compensated Grant for defending against the groundless claim. In his\n\nonly individual issue, Bennett contends the sanctions award was an abuse of discretion.\n\n                We review the trial court’s imposition of sanctions for an abuse of discretion.\n\nSee Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 614 (Tex. 2007). In reviewing the sanctions order, we review\n\nthe entire record to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion. American Flood Research,\n\nInc. v. Jones, 192 S.W.3d 581, 583 (Tex. 2006). An appellate court may reverse the trial court’s\n\nruling only if the trial court acted without reference to any guiding rules and principles, such that its\n\nruling was arbitrary or unreasonable. Low, 221 S.W.3d at 614. At the very least, this requires a\n\nshowing that the trial court based its order on an incorrect interpretation of the law or a clearly\n\nerroneous assessment of the evidence. Robson v. Gilbreath, 267 S.W.3d 401, 405 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n                                                   50\n\f2008, pet. denied). The trial court does not abuse its discretion if it bases its sanctions on conflicting\n\nevidence and some evidence supports its decision. Unifund CCR Partners v. Villa, 299 S.W.3d 92,\n\n97 (Tex. 2009).\n\n                Here, the trial court’s order did not specify the legal basis for the sanctions, so we\n\nbegin our review by identifying all the potential legal bases for the order. See Citibank, N.A. v. Estes,\n\n385 S.W.3d 671, 675 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). Chapter 10 of the Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code, in pertinent part, authorizes a court to sanction a person, a party\n\nwho represents the person, or both for signing a pleading that was brought for any improper\n\npurpose—including to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 10.001, 10.004; see Mattox v. Grimes Cnty. Comm’rs Court,\n\n305 S.W.3d 375, 386 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet. denied) (“Sanctions under\n\nchapter 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code are authorized if the evidence establishes that\n\n. . . a pleading or motion was brought for an improper purpose.”). Here, the trial court’s order\n\nconcludes that Bennett filed his slander claim for at least two improper purposes—“to punish\n\na witness who had testified against him in previous lawsuits” and “to subvert a separate trial,\n\n[Bennett I].” The trial court further concluded that Bennett’s refusal to nonsuit his slander claim,\n\n“substantially increased the burden on this case on the defendant and on the court system” and\n\n“required in essence a re-trial of [Bennett I].” As the trial court made findings that Bennett filed\n\nthis suit for improper purposes specifically prohibited by Chapter 10, we conclude the trial court\n\ncould have relied on Chapter 10 as the legal basis for the award. Further, Bennett has not challenged\n\non appeal the trial court’s finding that he filed this suit against Grant for improper purposes.\n\n\n\n                                                   51\n\fGenerally, an appellant must attack all independent bases or grounds that fully support a complained-\n\nof ruling or judgment. See Britton , 95 S.W.3d at 681. As Bennett has failed to attack this basis that\n\nsupports the sanctions order, we cannot conclude the trial court’s imposition of sanctions was an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n                In addition, Rule 13 similarly authorizes a trial court to sanction a person, a\n\nrepresented party, or both for signing a pleading that is groundless and brought in bad faith or to\n\nharass. Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. Pleadings are presumed filed in good faith under Rule 13, and the burden\n\nis on the moving party to demonstrate both that the opposing party’s filings: (1) are groundless;\n\nand (2) were filed either in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. Id. In determining whether\n\nsanctions are appropriate, the trial court must examine the facts available to the litigant and the\n\ncircumstances existing when the litigant filed the pleading. Robson, 267 S.W.3d at 409. Further,\n\nunder Rule 13, the trial court is required to state in the order the particulars of good cause justifying\n\nthe sanctions. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 13.\n\n                The trial court’s order here concludes, consistent with a violation of Rule 13, that\n\nBennett’s slander claim was “groundless,” “part of a plan to harass and intimidate Grant,” and\n\nbrought in “bad faith.”25 As such, we conclude that Rule 13 could have also been the legal basis for\n\nthe trial court’s award. Further, the sanctions order states the particulars of good cause justifying\n\nsanctions under Rule 13. First, there are numerous findings in the order that Bennett brought this\n\n\n        25\n           The trial court also submitted this question to the jury, which concluded that Bennett’s\nsuit was groundless and brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. Bennett contends the\ntrial court erred in submitting the sanctions issue to the jury because it was a question of law.\nRegardless, the sanctions order indicates the trial court made its own findings to support the\nsanctions order separate from the jury’s findings.\n\n                                                   52\n\fsuit in bad faith and for purposes of harassment, including findings that: (1) Bennett had filed this\n\nsuit to punish Grant for testifying against him in previous lawsuits; (2) Bennett had “doctored” or\n\n“altered” evidence to cover up his conversion of Reynolds’ cattle and give grounds to his baseless\n\nslander claim against Grant; (3) and that Bennett’s true purpose in the suit was not to recover money\n\ndamages from Grant—who lacked the financial resources to pay an award—but to subvert a separate\n\ncivil trial, Bennett I, and to harass Grant. Bennett does not challenge the legal sufficiency of any of\n\nthese findings on appeal.\n\n                With regard to groundlessness, Bennett pleaded that he had instructed Grant not to\n\nsell any cattle that did not belong to him, and therefore, Grant’s allegation that he had stolen the\n\ncattle was slander. The trial court, however, found in its order that Bennett had converted Reynolds’\n\ncattle and then engaged in a “design to cover up his conversion” that implied “willfulness and bad\n\nfaith, not inadvertence or an honest mistake.” This finding states with particularity the trial court’s\n\ngood cause for concluding the slander claim was groundless—as the trial court found there was\n\nno factual basis to support Bennett’s pleadings that Reynolds’ cattle had been sold accidentally\n\nand there was no legal basis for his slander claim because substantial truth is a complete defense\n\nto slander. See id. (groundless means no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith\n\nargument for change of existing law); see also Randall’s Food Mkt., Inc. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d\n\n640, 646 (Tex. 1995) (substantial truth of an alleged defamatory statement is complete defense to\n\nslander action). Further, while Bennett testified in support of his allegations, the trial court does not\n\nabuse its discretion when there is conflicting evidence that supports its decision, see Unifund CCR\n\nPartners, 299 S.W.3d at 97, and Bennett has not challenged the legal sufficiency of this finding on\n\n\n\n                                                   53\n\fappeal. In addition, the trial court finds in its order that Bennett’s deceit in covering up his\n\nwrongdoing by doctoring or altering evidence, “confirms the groundlessness of the slander claim”\n\nand was to “further his attempts to give grounds to his baseless harassment of Grant.” As such, we\n\ncannot agree with Bennett’s contention in his brief that the sanctions order “fails to state good cause\n\nfor finding groundlessness with the particularity Rule 13 requires.” Rather, we conclude the\n\nsanctions order states with particularity the reasons and circumstances justifying the trial court’s\n\nfinding of good cause to issue sanctions under Rule 13.26\n\n               Bennett further contends the award of sanctions against him individually was an\n\nabuse of discretion because his lawyer signed and filed his pleadings, and “a party should not be\n\nsanctioned for its attorney’s conduct unless the party is implicated apart from having entrusted its\n\nlegal representation to counsel.” See Loeffler v. Lytle Indep. Sch. Dist., 211 S.W.3d 331, 349–50\n\n\n\n\n       26\n           On rehearing, Bennett contends for the first time that “Grant never noticed any formal\nhearing on his request for sanctions.” See Tex. R. Civ. P. 13 (sanctions may be imposed upon\nmotion or upon court’s own initiative, after notice and hearing); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n§ 10.002–3 (same). The record, however, shows that Bennett’s counsel was served with notice of\nthe sanctions hearing. Moreover, “the proper method to preserve [Bennett’s] notice complaint was\nto bring the lack of adequate notice to the attention of the trial court at the hearing, object to the\nhearing going forward, and/or move for a continuance.” See Low v. Henry, 221 S.W.3d 609, 618\n(Tex. 2007). Bennett additionally complains on rehearing that “Grant never filed a formal motion\nfor sanctions.” Bennett failed to raise this issue at the trial court or in his appeal. Grant did plead\nfor attorneys’ fees based on Bennett’s filing of a groundless claim, and the trial court had submitted\na jury question asking whether Bennett’s slander claim was groundless and brought in bad faith or\nfor purposes of harassment. The jury answered affirmatively. Grant then moved the court to enter\nfinal judgment sanctioning Bennett for filing a groundless claim brought in bad or for purposes of\nharassment. Prior to the court’s sanctions order, Bennett also filed a brief with the court contending\nthat he should not be sanctioned because his claims were not groundless nor brought in bad faith or\nfor purposes of harassment. Thus, on the record, Grant moved the trial court to issue sanctions and\nBennett plainly had notice of the grounds on which Grant was seeking sanctions and an opportunity\nto respond.\n\n                                                  54\n\f(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, pet. denied). Again, we disagree. While Bennett’s attorneys filed\n\nand signed his pleadings, Bennett provided the factual basis for the slander claim and authorized\n\nhis attorneys to file suit based on those allegations. Further, the trial court made several specific\n\nfindings that sanctionable conduct was attributable to Bennett himself27 and that Bennett had\n\nbrought the slander suit as revenge for Grant testifying against him in previous suits. As such, we\n\ncannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Bennett was implicated in the\n\nsanctionable conduct. Concluding he has failed to prove on appeal that the trial court’s award of\n\nsanctions was arbitrary or unreasonable, we overrule Bennett’s sole individual issue on appeal.28\n\n\n\n\n       27\n           The trial court’s order provides many instances of Bennett personally implicating\nhimself, including one instance where he—outside the presence of the jury—altered a hand-drawn\nexhibit depicting Reynolds’ brand. When confronted about the alteration, Bennett claimed he\nwas merely highlighting the exhibit so the jury could see it better, and that it was okay because\nthe Judge was in the courtroom when he made the alteration. The trial court notes in its order that\n“although the Judge was present in the room, such alteration was not observed or sanctioned by\nanyone, the Court included.” In addition to the sanctions expressly authorized by Rule 13 and\nChapter 10, the trial court has the inherent power to sanction such bad faith conduct that occurs\nduring the course of litigation. See Public Util. Comm’n v. Cofer, 754 S.W.2d 121, 124 (Tex. 1988);\nEichelberger v. Eichelberger, 582 S.W.2d 395, 398 (Tex. 1979).\n       28\n            We acknowledge that the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded as sanctions is significant.\nChapter 10 and Rule 13, however, specify that attorneys’ fees caused by improper conduct are an\nappropriate sanction. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.004(c)(3); Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. Bennett\nhas not raised any challenge to the amount of the award on appeal. On rehearing, Bennett contends\nhe is entitled to remand to allow the trial court to reconsider the amount of the award in light of the\nTexas Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Nath v. Texas Children’s Hospital. See 446 S.W.3d 355,\n372 (Tex. 2014) (holding that sanctions were warranted but remand was necessary to determine\nwhether, by litigating for over four years before seeking sanctions, the moving party bore some\nresponsibility for the attorneys’ fees it incurred). In Nath, however, the sanctioned party preserved\nerror by challenging the excessiveness of the attorneys’ fees at the trial court and on appeal. See\n446 S.W.3d at 361, 364. Here, Bennett did not raise the issue of excessiveness at the trial court nor\non appeal. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude he is entitled to remand under Nath.\n\n                                                  55\n\f                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               This is an unusual case. Malicious prosecution itself is an unusual tort, and it is\n\nexceptionally unique under Texas jurisprudence for a defendant to procure a prosecution by both\n\nproviding false information to authorities and by engaging in such other improper activities that his\n\nconduct became the determining factor in the decision to prosecute. Looking to the exemplary\n\ndamages award, this case is also unique because another exemplary damages award, in Bennett I,\n\nhas already been adjudicated by the Texas Supreme Court and found unconstitutional. The facts\n\nand circumstances of this case, however, are vastly different than those in Bennett I and justify the\n\nimposition of a larger exemplary damages award. This case differs from Bennett I—and again is\n\nsomewhat unique under Texas jurisprudence—because it is a potential-harm case and all but one of\n\nthe five reprehensibility factors are present. As remitted, we are confident the exemplary damages\n\naward passes constitutional muster under current federal standards.29 Accordingly, we reform the\n\ntrial court's judgment to award Grant $512,109 in exemplary damages against Bennett and $512,109\n\nin exemplary damages against Bonham. We affirm the trial court's judgment as reformed.\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n\n                                              Scott K.

The feud between cattle\n\nranchers Thomas O. Bennett and Randy Reynolds has many turbulent twists and turns, see id., but\n\nthe gist of the dispute and subject of prior appeals involved allegations that thirteen head of cattle\n\fbelonging to Reynolds had wandered onto Bennett’s ranch, and that instead of returning them in a\n\nneighborly fashion, Bennett ordered his ranch hand—Larry Grant—to round up the cattle and sell\n\nthem at auction. Grant testified that he raised concerns with Bennett that the cattle did not belong\n\nto him, but Bennett ignored his concerns.1 Worried that he could be implicated in cattle theft, Grant\n\npurchased a disposable camera and took several photos of the cattle loaded on Bennett’s trailer\n\nprior to the sale. Within two months of the sale, Grant left his employment with Bennett but kept\n\nthe secret photos stashed away in a box in his home where they were seemingly forgotten and left\n\nundisturbed for almost a year. Reynolds, however, eventually learned of the secret photos after a\n\nchance encounter with Grant’s brother-in-law and demanded that Grant turn the photos over to the\n\nauthorities. What happens next is hotly disputed and the subject of litigation between Bennett and\n\nhis former ranch hand, Grant, which gave rise to this appeal.\n\n                After Reynolds attempted to obtain the photos, Grant testified that he was distressed\n\nand began drinking beer and smoking marijuana to relieve tension. He then made a series of\n\nphone calls to Bennett and Bennett’s friend and employee, Don “Ex” Rogers. Grant testified that\n\nthe purpose of the calls was to inform Bennett of the pictures and give him an opportunity to “make\n\nit right” with Reynolds. Bennett and Rogers’ version, however, depicts Grant as calling to try and\n\nsell the photographs to Bennett. Grant acknowledged he had some discussion with Rogers about\n\nselling the photos to Bennett but testified that they only “joked about it.” It was no joke, however,\n\nwhen Grant turned the photos over to law enforcement about a month after these conversations\n\nand triggered an extraordinary series of events. First, Bennett was indicted for cattle theft based\n\n\n       1\n           The facts recited herein are taken from the record on appeal.\n\n                                                  2\n\fin part on Grant’s testimony and photos. Although ultimately acquitted of the criminal charges,\n\nBennett and his cattle company, the James B. Bonham Corporation, were found liable for conversion\n\nin a civil suit brought by Reynolds resulting in a judgment of $5,327.11 in actual damages. The\n\nactual damages, however, paled in comparison to the combined exemplary damages of $1.25\n\nmillion awarded amidst allegations that Bennett had willfully sold his neighbor’s cattle to settle\n\na score in a long-standing feud and then attempted to cover his actions by—among other\n\nallegations—threatening and bribing witnesses, tampering with the photographs Grant had taken to\n\nalter the images of the brands on the cattle to look like his own brand, and even attempting to\n\nregister his neighbor’s brand as his own with the district clerk of San Saba County. Such allegations\n\nand such a large exemplary damages award are extraordinary by themselves,2 but it is only half of the\n\nstory and less than half of the total liability adjudged against Bennett and the Bonham Corporation\n\nfrom these events.\n\n               The other half is the subject of this appeal—a $2.28 million judgment awarded to\n\nGrant for a successful malicious prosecution claim brought against Bennett and the Bonham\n\nCorporation. This claim arose from Bennett’s admitted, yet ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to\n\nhave Grant imprisoned after he turned the photos over to authorities. In this appeal, Bennett and\n\nthe Bonham Corporation (collectively, Appellants) contest the judgment in Grant’s malicious\n\nprosecution suit, contending: (1) legally insufficient evidence supported the malicious prosecution\n\nclaim; (2) legally and factually insufficient evidence supported the $10,703 awarded in compensatory\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        Indeed, the Texas Supreme Court found the exemplary damages violated due process and\nremanded the case for remittitur. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 883.\n\n                                                 3\n\fdamages; (3) legally insufficient evidence supported the jury’s findings allowing for the imposition\n\nof exemplary damages over the statutory cap; and (4) the total $2 million exemplary damages award\n\n($1 million against Bennett and $1 million against the Bonham Corporation) violated due process.\n\nIndividually, the Bonham Corporation raises several arguments challenging its liability in the suit,\n\nand Bennett challenges a $269,644.50 sanction. We conclude that the award of exemplary damages\n\nfailed to comport with due process requirements and required remittitur, but otherwise uphold the\n\ntrial court’s judgment.\n\n\n                                  MALICIOUS PROSECUTION\n\n\nA.      Background Facts\n\n                On the evening of October 4, 2001, telephone records confirm that Grant called\n\nand spoke with Bennett for thirteen minutes, but the topic of conversation that evening is hotly\n\ndisputed by the parties. As previously discussed, Grant testified that he called to inform Bennett\n\nabout the pictures and to give him an opportunity to “make it right” with Reynolds. Bennett,\n\nhowever, testified that Grant called to try and sell the photos to him for $5,000. What is undisputed,\n\nhowever, is that Bennett waited nearly two years to report his allegations against Grant to the\n\nauthorities. Indeed, Bennett testified that it was not until after his criminal trial that he decided to\n\nreport the incident to authorities and acknowledged at trial that his sole “goal” in reporting the\n\nincident was to put “Grant in prison . . . for what he’s done to me.” In furtherance of his goal, Bennett\n\ntestified he met with law enforcement authorities in four separate counties in an attempt to get\n\nGrant indicted for attempted blackmail. After authorities in San Saba County, Llano County, and\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fColeman County refused to prosecute Grant, Bennett met with the district attorney in Navarro County\n\nand requested he prosecute the case.\n\n               According to the district attorney’s testimony, the following events then transpired.\n\nAfter his initial meeting with Bennett, the district attorney believed that if an attempted blackmail\n\nhad occurred, it was a federal offense and referred the matter to the federal authorities. Unhappy\n\nwith this outcome, Bennett again approached the district attorney but this time with a new\n\ntheory—requesting that Grant be prosecuted for attempted theft. The district attorney informed\n\nBennett he could not bring charges for misdemeanor attempted theft because it was barred by the\n\ntwo-year statute of limitations. Undeterred, Bennett then provided the district attorney with new\n\ninformation, alleging—for the first time—that Grant had attempted to extort money from him a\n\nsecond time within the limitations period. The district attorney testified that he was “skeptical” of\n\nthis new evidence because it “appeared that there was maybe some tailoring of the facts going on to\n\nfit the statute.” Indeed, in his sworn testimony in this case, Bennett made no mention of a second\n\nattempted blackmail by Grant. Rather, he unequivocally testified that all the factual accusations\n\nagainst Grant occurred in a single evening on October 4, 2011. The district attorney further testified\n\nthat, based on his conversations with Bennett about the case, he formed the impression that\n\nBennett’s motive for prosecuting Grant was to gain an advantage in civil litigation arising from the\n\ncase. Being “suspicious” of Bennett’s new evidence, the district attorney decided to “dig in his heels”\n\nand refused to prosecute.\n\n               Still undeterred, Bennett met with an attorney who testified that he had represented\n\nthe Bonham Corporation for over twenty years and that Bennett directed him to research and draft\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fa legal brief advocating that Grant’s alleged actions constituted a criminal offense that should be\n\nprosecuted. The district attorney testified that it was this brief or another meeting with Bennett that\n\nfinally was the “catalyst” that prompted him to bring the case to the grand jury. He further testified\n\nthat it was “rare” for him to bring misdemeanor cases to the grand jury because he himself had the\n\nauthority to bring misdemeanor charges without grand jury involvement. But, in this case, he finally\n\nyielded to Bennett’s demands because he did not want to appear “draconian” in his refusal to bring\n\ncharges. The district attorney may have been finally persuaded to present the case, but the grand jury\n\nwas not as persuaded and refused to indict Grant.\n\n                Frustrated that the grand jury had not indicted Grant, Bennett testified he again\n\nmet with the same attorney who this time advised him to get a special prosecutor appointed in\n\nNavarro County to bring the case before the grand jury a second time. After the attorney explained\n\nto him the procedure for appointing a special prosecutor, Bennett testified he had the attorney draft\n\na petition alleging the district attorney had a conflict of interest and accusing him of taking no\n\naction in the case.3 The petition further sought the appointment of Robert Dunn—a local attorney\n\nand neighbor of Bennett’s—as a special prosecutor for the case. Bennett, who resided and ran a\n\ncattle ranch in Navarro County, testified that he then led the effort to circulate and obtain over 250\n\nsignatures from Navarro County residents for the petition seeking the appointment of Dunn as\n\nspecial prosecutor for the case. Bennett testified that others helped with the petition but that “it was\n\nmostly me . . . I think I done most of it.” The district attorney, who was now seeking reelection\n\n\n\n\n        3\n         The petition alleged the district attorney had a conflict of interest in the case because he\nhad previously worked for the district attorney’s office in Llano County.\n\n                                                   6\n\fin a hotly contested race, testified that he was unaware that Bennett was leading this campaign\n\nthroughout the county until Bennett showed up at his office for a final meeting. Bennett, with the\n\nsigned petitions in hand, then accused the district attorney of being partial and unfair when he\n\npresented Grant’s case to the grand jury and demanded that Dunn be appointed special prosecutor\n\nin the case. Feeling that Bennett’s petition campaign “wasn’t helping” his chances of reelection,\n\nthe district attorney testified that he agreed to the appointment of Dunn as special prosecutor in\n\nthe case.4\n\n               Ultimately, Bennett was successful in his goal of getting Grant indicted, as the\n\nspecial prosecutor presented the case for a second time to the grand jury—more than four years\n\nafter the phone call between Grant and Bennett occurred—but this time obtained indictments for the\n\nfelony offenses of tampering with a witness and attempted bribery. The special prosecutor testified\n\nthat in deciding whether to present the case to the grand jury, he interviewed both Bennett and\n\nRogers but exercised independent discretion in ultimately determining whether there was sufficient\n\nevidence to prosecute the case. He testified further that he relied on evidence other than Bennett’s\n\nand Rogers’ statements in his decision to prosecute. When asked, however, whether Bennett’s and\n\nRogers’ statements were “very material to [his] decision to proceed to the grand jury,” the special\n\nprosecutor acknowledged that the statements were “definitely” very material to his decision. Further,\n\nhe acknowledged testifying during his deposition that he “would not have presented” the case to the\n\n\n\n\n        4\n          Later that year, the district attorney lost his reelection. Almost immediately after starting\nprivate practice, Bennett came to the former district attorney’s office and retained him as counsel\nfor himself and the Bonham Corporation in two separate lawsuits.\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fgrand jury if he had believed Bennett “was making untrue statements.” He also testified that if he\n\nbelieved there had been a “tailoring of the facts” by Bennett—as the Navarro County district attorney\n\nbelieved—that it would have affected his decision to go to the grand jury.5 Grant maintained\n\nthroughout trial that both men had lied to the authorities about the alleged blackmail.\n\n                Further, some of the evidence Bennett presented to the special prosecutor appears\n\nfrom the record to have differed from the initial evidence presented to the district attorney. First,\n\nthere is no evidence in the record that Bennett reported to the special prosecutor two incidents of\n\nalleged extortion occurring on different dates—as he had to the district attorney. Rather, the special\n\nprosecutor testified only as to the alleged misconduct occurring during phone conversations on\n\nOctober 4, 2011, and the indictment alleged only one count—not two—of the charged offenses.\n\nSecond, Bennett added a new detail to his allegations, contending for the first time that Grant had\n\nspecifically asked him to pay $5,000 for the pictures. In a previous written statement to the\n\nauthorities, Bennett did not allege a specified amount in his extortion claims. The Navarro County\n\ndistrict attorney also did not recall Bennett telling him this detail, and it would have been material\n\nto how he presented the case to the grand jury because the amount of money at issue increased the\n\ndegree of the offense.6 See Tex. Penal Code § 31.03(e) (value of property involved in theft dictates\n\nclassification of offense). Finally, the special prosecutor additionally testified that in deciding to\n\n        5\n           The Navarro County district attorney testified that he had informed the special prosecutor\nof his belief that there had been some tailoring of the facts by Bennett. The special prosecutor denied\nthis, testifying that “no one had told [him]” of any manipulation of the facts by Bennett.\n        6\n          Interestingly, the district attorney testified that the amount at issue increased the degree of\nthe offense from a misdemeanor to a felony. The statute of limitations for felony theft is five years,\nrather than the two year statute of limitations for misdemeanor theft. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc.\narts. 12.01(4)(A), 12.02.\n\n                                                   8\n\fprosecute the case, he relied—in part—on a transcript from Bennett purportedly transcribing\n\nsecretly-taped “conversations” with Grant that substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant had sought\n\n$5,000 from him. If this transcript was also given to the district attorney, he made no reference to\n\nit in his testimony.\n\n                Regarding the transcript, the special prosecutor testified that initially Bennett\n\npresented him with a tape recording of “conversations” but that he was unable to understand it\n\nbecause it was “awful garbled.” Bennett then gave him a transcript purportedly transcribing the\n\ntape. The special prosecutor could not testify as to when the tape was allegedly recorded, but it\n\nappears from his testimony that he believed the tape was a recording of the actual telephone\n\nconversations reflected on Grant’s telephone bill or conversations related directly to those phone\n\nrecords. He further testified that the taped conversations substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant\n\nhad specifically sought “$5,000” for the pictures. This transcript, however, was destroyed when\n\nGrant’s record was later expunged. Besides this information, there is no additional information in\n\nthe record as to what was reflected in the transcript or the tape. Bennett himself testified at trial that\n\nhe had secretly recorded a conversation with Grant and had presented this tape to law enforcement,\n\nbut this tape recorded only a single conversation between Grant and Bennett occurring almost a year\n\nprior to Grant’s alleged extortion. As such, there is no mention on the tape of the photographs or\n\na demand for $5,000. Indeed, when the special prosecutor was presented with a transcript of the tape\n\nBennett testified to presenting to other law enforcement, the special prosecutor testified that he had\n\nnever seen it before, and it was “completely different” than the transcript Bennett had given him.\n\n                Bennett’s plan to imprison Grant seemed to finally be coming to fruition when the\n\nspecial prosecutor then took this evidence to a second grand jury and succeeded in obtaining two\n\n                                                    9\n\ffelony indictments, and Grant surrendered himself to authorities. But Bennett’s long and hard-fought\n\nquest ended nine months later, when both of Grant’s indictments were quashed because the charges\n\nhad been filed past the statute of limitations. Further, the trial court granted Grant’s motion to have\n\nhis arrest and indictments expunged from his record as void. Upon expunction, Grant—who was\n\nalready being sued by Bennett for slander—added a counterclaim against Bennett and the Bonham\n\nCorporation for malicious criminal prosecution.7 Upon hearing the preceding evidence, the jury found\n\nthat Bennett and the Bonham Corporation had indeed maliciously prosecuted Grant. They appeal,\n\ncontending there is insufficient evidence of a malicious prosecution. Appellants’ claim requires us to\n\nfirst expound upon the law of malicious prosecution.\n\n\nB.     Malicious Prosecution\n\n                Malicious prosecution is an unusual tort in that it requires the court to balance\n\nsociety’s interest in protecting private persons who report criminal conduct with the individual\n\ncitizen’s interest in being protected against unjustifiable and oppressive litigation of criminal\n\ncharges.

In that regard,\n\nthe Texas Supreme Court has instructed us that the balance between these important interests is\n\nmaintained by strictly adhering to the defined elements of an action for malicious prosecution and\n\nthat even a small departure from the exact prerequisites for liability may threaten this delicate\n\nbalance. Id. But, “as with any other cause of action, if the elements of malicious prosecution are\n\nproved, liability is established.” Id. at 291. Those elements are: (1) the commencement of a criminal\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           The jury found against Bennett on his slander claim, which Bennett does not appeal.\n\n                                                  10\n\fprosecution against the plaintiff; (2) causation of the action by the defendant; (3) termination of the\n\nprosecution in the plaintiff’s favor; (4) the plaintiff’s innocence; (5) the absence of probable cause\n\nfor the proceedings; (6) malice in filing the charges; and (7) damages.

Rather, they argue only that there is legally insufficient evidence that Bennett’s\n\nconduct caused the commencement of a criminal prosecution against Grant. The causation element\n\nof malicious prosecution requires evidence that a defendant “initiated” or “procured” a criminal\n\nprosecution. Lieck, 881 S.W.2d at 292. A person initiates a criminal prosecution if he makes a\n\nformal charge to law enforcement authorities. Id. Here, there is no evidence in the record that\n\nBennett filed any formal charges; Grant, therefore, relies on procurement. A person “procures” a\n\ncriminal prosecution “if his actions are enough to cause the prosecution, and but for his actions the\n\nprosecution would not have occurred.” Id. Thus, procurement requires that a person’s actions be\n\nboth a “necessary and a sufficient cause of the criminal prosecution.” Id. Appellants argue there is\n\nno evidence Bennett “procured” Grant’s criminal prosecution because the prosecutors involved\n\nacted with independent discretion, and their exercise of discretion was a superceding, intervening\n\ncause of the prosecution that destroyed his own liability in bringing about the charges. Appellants\n\nare correct that generally a person cannot procure a criminal prosecution when the decision whether\n\nto prosecute is left to the discretion of another because the independent exercise of discretion\n\ndestroys the necessary causal link between the defendant and the prosecution. See id. There are,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fhowever, two important exceptions to this rule where a defendant may still be liable for malicious\n\nprosecution because his actions are such that it makes an intelligent exercise of discretion impossible:\n\n(1) when a defendant provides information which he knows is false that causes a criminal prosecution,\n\nor (2) when a defendant’s conduct was the determining factor in the prosecutor’s decision to\n\nprosecute. See id. at 292–94. We conclude there is legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding of causation under both exceptions.\n\n\n        1.      Legally sufficient evidence Bennett procured Grant’s prosecutions by providing\n                false information.\n\n                The first exception is when a defendant provides information which he knows is false\n\nthat causes a criminal prosecution. See id. at 293. For this exception, the plaintiff must prove both\n\nthat the defendant knowingly furnished false information to authorities, and that but for such false\n\ninformation, the prosecutor would not have decided to prosecute.

Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894491\"><a href=\"/opinion/894491/king-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n76 (Tex. 2003). The prosecutor’s reliance on the false information makes an intelligent exercise\n\nof discretion impossible and establishes the causal link necessary to hold the defendant liable for\n\nmalicious prosecution. See id. at 78. But, if the decision to prosecute would have been made\n\nwith or without the false information, the defendant did not cause the prosecution by supplying\n\nfalse information. A single prosecution may, however, be procured by more than one person. Lieck,\n\n881 S.W.2d at 292.\n\n                Appellants challenge only the legal sufficiency of the jury’s finding that Bennett\n\nprocured Grant’s prosecution.

In conducting a legal-sufficiency review, we consider\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, crediting evidence that a reasonable fact\n\nfinder could have considered favorable and disregarding unfavorable evidence unless the reasonable\n\nfact finder could not. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 807. We indulge every reasonable inference that\n\nsupports the jury’s findings. Id. at 822. Therefore, we must uphold the jury’s verdict unless—after\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict and disregarding contrary\n\nevidence unless a reasonable jury could not—there is no more than a scintilla of evidence to support\n\nthe finding of procurement.\n\n               Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, the Navarro\n\nCounty district attorney believed Bennett’s claims were barred by limitations and would never have\n\nbrought this case before the grand jury but for Bennett changing his story to add an additional claim\n\nof extortion occurring within the limitations period. As Grant testified this was a false allegation,\n\nwe will assume—for purposes of our analysis—that the allegation was false, and there is more than\n\nsufficient evidence that the false allegation was the but-for cause of the prosecutor presenting the\n\ncase to the grand jury. Traditionally, however, the tort of malicious prosecution does not arise until\n\nprocess is issued, an indictment is returned, information filed, or the accused is arrested. See\n\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 654 (1977). Here, there is no evidence in the record that any of\n\n                                                 13\n\fthese events occurred with regard to this first proceeding before the grand jury or that Grant was\n\naware of or suffered damages from this proceeding. Accordingly, the bulk of our analysis must\n\nfocus on the second presentment of the case to the grand jury by the special prosecutor, which\n\nultimately resulted in two indictments and Grant’s arrest.\n\n               Viewing the evidence regarding the second grand jury proceeding in the light most\n\nfavorable to the verdict, we conclude there was more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding that Bennett procured the prosecution. The special prosecutor acknowledged in his testimony\n\nthat Bennett’s statements were “definitely . . . very material” to his decision to proceed to the grand\n\njury. He further acknowledged that if he had believed Bennett’s statements were untruthful, then\n\nhe “would not have presented” the case to the grand jury. Assuming Bennett’s statements were false,\n\nthe special prosecutor’s testimony provides more than a scintilla of evidence that Bennett was a\n\nnecessary and sufficient cause of the prosecution. Compare King, 126 S.W.3d at 79 (holding\n\ninsufficient evidence of causation where “[n]othing in the record shows that the false information\n\nwas material to the decision to prosecute”). Further, there was additional evidence that the special\n\nprosecutor relied on the transcript that Bennett had given him allegedly transcribing secretly-taped\n\nconversations with Grant. From the record, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to infer\n\nthat Bennett had fabricated this evidence and that it was a material cause of the prosecution, as the\n\nspecial prosecutor testified that the transcript substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant had sought\n\n$5,000 from him.\n\n               For legal sufficiency review, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nthe judgment, crediting evidence that a reasonable fact finder could have considered favorable and\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fdisregarding unfavorable evidence unless a reasonable fact finder could not. See City of Keller,\n\n168 S.W.3d at 827. We note here the special prosecutor testified that—in addition to the information\n\nprovided by Bennett—he also relied on Grant’s sworn testimony from Bennett’s prior criminal trial\n\nfor cattle theft. At that trial, the special prosecutor testified Grant purportedly admitted making a\n\nphone call to Rogers seeking money for the pictures but alleged he was only “joking.”8 The special\n\nprosecutor testified that in his opinion Grant “tried to cover himself” by alleging that it was a joke,\n\nand when asked whether he would have prosecuted based solely on this testimony, he responded:\n\n“I think so, because the fact is that he admitted making the calls.” (emphasis added). When a\n\nprosecutor relies on evidence independent of the false information provided by the defendant, the\n\ndefendant “cannot be said to have caused the prosecution if the [false] information was immaterial\n\nto the decision to prosecute.” King, 126 S.W.3d at 78. The special prosecutor, however, had\n\npreviously acknowledged that Bennett’s evidence was definitely very material to his decision to\n\nprosecute and that he would not have presented the case if he had thought Bennett was providing\n\nfalse information.9\n\n\n\n       8\n         The transcript from Grant’s sworn testimony is not in the record. Grant advanced the same\ntheory of innocence at this trial. For purposes of the malicious prosecution claim, the jury found\nGrant innocent of Bennett’s allegations.\n       9\n          The special prosecutor also testified that he relied on Rogers’ statement that Grant had\ntelephoned him and acknowledged attempting to sell the photos to Bennett. At trial, Bennett testified\nthat Rogers “was in on the efforts to get [Grant] charged.” Rogers is described in the record as\nBennett’s best friend and an employee of the Bonham Corporation. At trial, Grant denied Rogers’\naccusations, and the jury was free to disbelieve his testimony.

The Restatement provides the following example as illustration of this exception:\n\n\n               A goes to B, a district attorney and informs him that C has committed a\n       battery upon A. A is a political boss to whom B owes his election. A demands that\n       B prosecute C. The battery is one that has created no public disturbance and is\n       therefore an offense for which a public prosecutor would not ordinarily institute\n       proceedings. In compliance with A’s demand, B files an information against C. A\n       has procured the institution of the proceeding.\n\n\n\n\n§ 653 (1977)); see also Turner v.

App.—Fort\nWorth 1995, writ denied) (recognizing Texas Supreme Court’s holding in Lieck that malicious\nprosecution may occur when either a person gives false information to authorities or when a person’s\nconduct was determining factor in decision to prosecute).\n\n                                                 17\n\fRestatement (Second) Torts § 653 (1977). In the example, the defendant procured the prosecution\n\nby exerting improper pressure on the district attorney to bring charges that ordinarily would not have\n\nbeen filed. Similarly, in this case, there is legally sufficient evidence in the record that Grant would\n\nnot have been prosecuted but for Bennett’s acknowledged and systematic campaign to improperly\n\ninfluence the proceedings. First, the Navarro County district attorney testified emphatically that\n\nalthough he had the authority to file an information charging Grant with misdemeanor attempted\n\ntheft, he “dug in his heels” and steadfastly refused to press charges against Grant because of the\n\nstatute of limitations and because he believed Bennett had been tailoring the facts to create a\n\nchargeable offense. Only after immense pressure from Bennett and some altering of the facts, did\n\nthe district attorney finally yield and agree to bring the misdemeanor case before the grand jury.\n\nHe testified, however, that ordinarily he would not have presented this misdemeanor case to the\n\ngrand jury but only did so because of Bennett’s unceasing demands. Like the example in the\n\nRestatement, this proceeding before the grand jury would never have occurred but for Bennett\n\nexerting such pressure on the district attorney that his desire to have the proceeding commenced was\n\nthe determining factor in the district attorney’s decision to prosecute.\n\n                After the grand jury refused to indict, Bennett—undeterred in his goal of having\n\nGrant imprisoned—then organized and led an extraordinary petition campaign to put in place a\n\nhand-picked special prosecutor to indict Grant. At a time when the district attorney was facing a\n\nheavily-contested election, Bennett then came to the district attorney’s office with the petitions\n\ndemanding the appointment of his special prosecutor to the case. Feeling Bennett’s petition campaign\n\n“wasn’t helping” his chances of reelection, the district attorney again yielded to Bennett’s demands.\n\nHere, like the example in the Restatement, Grant’s second prosecution was a proceeding that would\n\n                                                  18\n\fhave never occurred but for Bennett’s exertion of untoward pressure on the district attorney.\n\nUndoubtedly, there is more than a scintilla of evidence that Bennett’s acknowledged and systematic\n\ncampaign to improperly influence judicial proceedings was the determining factor in the prosecution.\n\n                Accordingly, we conclude there is legally sufficient evidence that Bennett procured\n\nGrant’s prosecution by either providing false information to authorities or by engaging in such a\n\nsystematic and untoward campaign to influence judicial proceedings that his conduct was the\n\ndetermining factor in the prosecution.\n\n\n                                    CORPORATE LIABILITY\n\n                Having found sufficient evidence of Bennett’s liability in this suit, we next\n\naddress Bonham’s liability. With regard to Bonham, the jury made several alternate findings\n\nimputing corporate liability on Bonham for the malicious prosecution. First, under the malicious\n\nprosecution question, the jury found that both Bennett and Bonham—through an agent—had\n\nmaliciously prosecuted Grant. Second, the jury found that Bennett was acting in his capacity as\n\na vice-principal of Bonham when he maliciously prosecuted Grant. Finally, the jury found that\n\nBonham was responsible for Bennett’s conduct under a “reverse-piercing” theory of liability. In\n\ntwo individual issues, Bonham contests its liability, arguing: (1) that it was improperly joined as a\n\nparty to the suit and (2) there is no evidence to support the jury’s findings of corporate liability.\n\n\nA.      Joinder\n\n                In its first individual issue, Bonham contends that it was improperly joined as a party\n\nto this suit. A trial court is given a great deal of discretion in matters of joinder, and its decision on\n\n\n\n                                                   19\n\fsuch procedural issues will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.

Civ.\n\nApp.—Beaumont 1959, no writ).\n\n               Bonham’s misjoinder claim necessitates a brief review of this case’s procedural\n\nhistory. This suit was originally initiated by Bennett—the plaintiff in this suit—filing an original\n\npetition suing Grant for slander. In his original answer, Grant asserted a counterclaim against\n\nBennett for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Later, in an amended pleading, Grant\n\nadded Bonham as an additional counter-defendant to his intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim. Upon request of the trial court, Grant then filed a motion seeking leave to include\n\nBonham in the suit. Grant’s motion for leave sought to add Bonham as a party to the suit on the\n\ngrounds that Bonham was Bennett’s alter ego, and his claims of intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress against both Bennett and Bonham “arose from the same transaction, occurrence, or series\n\nof transactions or occurrences . . . and the questions of law and fact in this case are common to both\n\n[Bennett and Bonham].” After a hearing, the trial court granted the motion without stating the\n\ngrounds for the joinder and ordered Grant to serve Bonham with process. After being served, Bonham\n\nanswered as a party to the suit without further objection. Later, after Bonham had entered an\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fappearance in the suit, Grant again amended his pleadings to add—after his indictments were\n\nexpunged—an additional counterclaim against Bennett and Bonham for malicious prosecution.\n\nBonham answered the malicious prosecution claim without objection.\n\n                On appeal, however, Bonham contends it was improperly joined in the lawsuit under\n\nTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 38. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 38. Rule 38 provides that a defendant may\n\nbring in a third party to a suit if that person is or may be liable to him or the plaintiff for all or part\n\nof the plaintiff’s claim against him. Id. A third-party action under Rule 38 is not an independent\n\ncause of action but is derivative of the plaintiff’s claim. Id.; see In re Seven-O Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1399312\"><a href=\"/opinion/1399312/in-re-seven-o-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (Tex. App.—Waco 2009, orig. proceeding [mand. denied]). Here, we agree with Bonham\n\nthat Grant’s claim asserting an independent cause of action against it for intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress was not a third-party claim as contemplated by Rule 38. Grant did not assert—as\n\nRule 38 requires—that Bonham was liable for all or part of Bennett’s slander claim against him.\n\nRather, Grant sought to join Bonham as an additional party to his counterclaim seeking affirmative\n\nrelief for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n                We cannot, however, conclude that Bonham has proven the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion by allowing the joinder because our rules of civil procedure otherwise permit the joinder\n\nof a non-party to a previously filed counterclaim. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 97 provides that\n\nadditional persons—other than those made parties to the original action—may be made parties to\n\na counterclaim in accordance with the provisions of Rule 39 (“Joinder of Persons Needed for Just\n\nAdjudication”) and Rule 40 (“Permissive Joinder of Parties”). See Tex. R. Civ. P. 39, 40, 97(f);\n\nsee also Tex. R. Civ. P. 37 (“Before a case is called to trial, additional parties necessary or proper\n\n\n\n                                                    21\n\fparties to the suit, may be brought in, either by the plaintiff or the defendant upon such terms as the\n\ncourt may prescribe.”). Thus, non-parties must be joined as additional defendants to a counterclaim\n\nif in their absence complete relief cannot be afforded among the parties. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 39,\n\n97(f). In addition, the trial court has the discretion to permit the joinder of additional defendants to\n\na counterclaim under the permissive joinder provisions of Rule 40. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 40 (“All\n\npersons may be joined in one action as defendants if there is asserted against them jointly, severally,\n\nor in the alternative any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same transaction, occurrence,\n\nor series of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law or fact common to all of them will\n\narise in the action”), 97(f) (persons other than those made parties to the original action may be made\n\nparties to a counterclaim in accordance with the provisions of Rule 40).11\n\n                Further, we note that once Bonham entered an appearance in this suit, Grant was\n\nentitled to assert his additional counterclaim against Bonham for malicious prosecution without\n\nfurther service of process. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 97(b), 124. Under these circumstances, we cannot\n\nconclude—nor has Bonham proven—that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the\n\njoinder. See Varme, 881 S.W.2d at 883 (“We emphasize that the trial court is given great discretion\n\nover joinder questions.”). Accordingly, we overrule Bonham’s joinder arguments.12\n\n        11\n          On rehearing, the Appellants contend they had no notice that Grant was seeking to join\nBonham under permissive venue. Grant’s motion for leave sought to add Bonham as a party to his\ncounterclaim and tracked the language of the permissive joinder rule. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 40.\n        12\n           Bonham hints in its brief that “Grant’s claims against the Corporation were thinly veiled—yet\nultimately successful—efforts to avoid limitations.” The statute of limitations issue was not submitted\nin the jury charge, and Bonham does not assert in an issue on appeal that the evidence conclusively\nproves Grant’s claims were barred by limitations. Nor does Bonham appeal any ruling it sought with\nsufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of its limitations complaint. We need not address\nthe merits of the limitations issue.\n\n                                                    22\n\fB.     Corporate Liability\n\n               In its second individual issue, Bonham contends there is no evidence to support\n\nthe jury’s finding of corporate liability. Corporations can act only through human agents, and\n\nwhen “actions are taken by a vice-principal of a corporation, those acts may be deemed to be the\n\nacts of the corporation itself.” See GTE Sw., Inc. v.

A\n\ncorporation, however, cannot be liable for damages “if the vice-principal’s misconduct occurred\n\nwhile he was acting in a personal capacity unrelated to his authority as a corporate vice-principal.”\n\nBennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 884. A vice-principal of a corporation is a person who “represents the\n\ncorporation in its corporate capacity, and includes persons who have authority to employ, direct, and\n\ndischarge servants of the master, and those to whom a master has confided the management of the\n\nwhole or a division of his business.” Id. at 883.\n\n               Regarding Bennett’s relationship with Bonham, the Texas Supreme Court in Bennett I\n\nconcluded that Bennett was “indisputably a vice-principal of the Bonham Corporation, he was most\n\nlikely the only vice-principal and the only person whose conduct and decisions could subject the\n\ncorporation to exemplary damages.” Id. at 884. In this case, similar evidence was presented that,\n\nalthough Bonham was putatively owned by Bennett’s daughters, the daughters had no control over\n\nthe corporation and received no profits, and Bennett himself exclusively controlled and profited from\n\nBonham. Bennett testified that he did not own a home or a vehicle and did not have a bank account\n\nbut lived rent-free in a home owned by Bonham, drove Bonham vehicles, and “did whatever [he]\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fwanted to with the corporation bank account.” On this record, Bonham concedes that Bennett was\n\nindisputably a vice-principal of Bonham. Instead, Bonham argues only that there is insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that Bennett was acting in his capacity as a vice-principal of\n\nBonham when he maliciously prosecuted Grant.\n\n               In its brief, Bonham attempts to distinguish this case from Bennett I, in which the\n\nTexas Supreme Court found there was “ample evidence” that Bennett was acting in his corporate\n\ncapacity when he converted Reynolds’ cattle using “corporate authority over corporate employees,\n\non corporate land, [and] using corporate equipment.” Id. at 885. Bonham argues in its brief that in\n\ncontrast to Bennett I, “the instant case does not involve the use of corporate property or the exercise\n\nof corporate privileges to accomplish the underlying tort.” We conclude, however, that in this case\n\nthere is, again, more than ample evidence to impart corporate liability on Bonham.\n\n               Reviewing the record, Bennett’s malicious prosecution of Grant involved several\n\ncourses of conduct that implicate Bonham. First, Bennett contacted an attorney who had an ongoing\n\nattorney-client relationship with Bonham and directed him to research whether Grant’s alleged\n\nactions constituted a criminal offense. The attorney then drafted a brief based on his legal research\n\nadvocating that Grant be charged with attempted theft. The brief was sent to the Navarro district\n\nattorney and described as a “catalyst” in the district attorney’s decision to bring the case before a\n\ngrand jury. This same attorney was also pivotal in later advising Bennett to seek the appointment\n\nof a special prosecutor to the case and then drafted the petition accusing the Navarro County district\n\nattorney of bias. The attorney testified at trial that he had an ongoing attorney-client relationship\n\n\n\n\n                                                  24\n\fwith Bonham since 1982. When asked whether he had ever done any personal work for Bennett, the\n\nattorney answered: “I don’t remember ever doing anything for Mr. Bennett except a will one time.”\n\n               Bennett’s malicious prosecution of Grant was further accomplished by traveling many\n\nmiles in a Bonham vehicle to meet with officials in four different counties to have Grant prosecuted.\n\nBennett testified at trial that he did not own a vehicle and acknowledged that he used Bonham\n\nvehicles to accomplish this phase of the malicious prosecution. When asked whether he ever used\n\nBonham’s vehicles for personal use, Bennett responded “I don’t have much personal business.”\n\nBennett’s lack of personal business was further exemplified when he testified that he directed a\n\nBonham employee to type a transcript of his alleged secretly-taped conversation with Grant. He\n\nthen testified that he presented this typed transcript to law enforcement in his attempts to prosecute\n\nGrant. The employee who typed the transcript served as Bonham’s corporate representative at trial.”13\n\n               Viewing the foregoing evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we\n\nconclude there is more than a scintilla of evidence to support the jury’s finding that Bennett was\n\nacting in his capacity as a vice-principal of Bonham when he maliciously prosecuted Grant.14 We\n\noverrule Bonham’s individual issues on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n           We also note that the Navarro County district attorney testified that he had formed the\nimpression that Bennett was attempting to prosecute Grant in order to influence civil litigation\narising from this case. The jury further heard testimony that Grant was the “star witness” in the\nReynolds’ civil suit against both Bonham and Bennett, which eventually resulted in a $1 million\npunitive damages award against Bonham.\n       14\n           The jury alternatively found that Bonham was liable for Bennett’s malicious prosecution\nof Grant based on agency and reverse-piercing theories. We do not address Bonham’s challenges\nto these findings, as we have already concluded there was sufficient evidence to impart corporate\nliability on Bonham as a vice-principal.\n\n                                                 25\n\f                                           DAMAGES\n\n               After finding Bennett and the Bonham Corporation maliciously prosecuted Grant,\n\nthe jury found Grant was entitled to the following damages: $5,000 in mental anguish damages;\n\n$60,000 in attorneys’ fees incurred defending the malicious prosecution; $1 million in punitive\n\ndamages awarded against Bennett; and another $1 million in punitive damages awarded against the\n\nBonham Corporation. The trial court’s final judgment reduced the award of compensatory damages\n\nto $10,703 but awarded Grant, in accordance with the jury’s verdict, $2 million in punitive damages.\n\nAppellants challenge the entire award. We will begin by reviewing the compensatory damages\n\nawarded to Grant, which are comprised of $5,000 for mental anguish damages and $5,703 in\n\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n\nA.     Mental Anguish\n\n               Appellants first contend there is no evidence to support the trial court’s award of\n\n$5,000 in mental anguish damages. Although Grant was indicted and arrested as a result of their\n\nmalicious prosecution, Appellants challenge the mental anguish damages contending there is\n\ninsufficient evidence Grant suffered the “high degree of mental pain and distress necessary for\n\ncompensable mental anguish.” To support an award of mental anguish damages, there must be both\n\nevidence of the existence of compensable mental anguish damages and evidence to justify the\n\namount awarded.

Each time he would move, however, Grant testified that Bennett would\n\nshow up at depositions with his tape recorder and pencil in hand to record Grant’s new address. At\n\none such deposition taken prior to his indictment, Grant testified that he heard Bennett avow that “he\n\nwould see me go to the penitentiary.” He further testified that he was aware of other instances when\n\nBennett “had seen that people went to prison” and believed Bennett was “fully capable of seeing that\n\n[he] went to prison.” After hearing Bennett’s testimony that it was his goal to put him in prison,\n\nGrant testified he was fearful to leave home and would lock himself in his house to protect his\n\nfamily. When Grant was finally indicted, his lawyer informed him he had been charged with a\n\nfelony and was facing prison time. Grant and his mother then drove the three and half hours from\n\nColeman, Texas, where he lived, to Corsicana, Texas, where he had been indicted. Grant surrendered\n\nhimself to the authorities in Corsicana and was released that day on a surety bond posted by his\n\nmother. For the next nine months, the charges remained pending against Grant. Grant testified that\n\nhe worried how his family would be taken care of if he went to prison and that he was afraid to leave\n\nhis family alone. He further testified that as a result of worrying about what Bennett was going to\n\ndo, “I would have bad headaches, weak stomach, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep.” Grant additionally\n\ntestified that the experience affected his mental state as he went from being “a happy-go-lucky”\n\nperson to feeling like a “completely different person” who struggled with self-esteem and distanced\n\nhimself from friends and family. Grant’s sister confirmed that she noticed a change in Grant’s\n\ndemeanor, testifying that her brother “just closed himself and sequestered himself from everyone.”\n\n                                                  27\n\f               Based on the foregoing, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the jury’s\n\nfinding that Grant suffered the degree of mental pain and distress that will support an award of mental\n\nanguish damages and that the award of $5,000 was well within the range supported by the evidence.\n\n\nB.     Attorneys’ Fees\n\n               When a defendant has caused attorneys’ fees to be incurred in defense of a criminal\n\ncharge which was maliciously prosecuted, attorneys’ fees in defending the prior criminal charge are\n\nrecoverable in the malicious prosecution suit as damages. See IBP, Inc. v. Klumpe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1634120\"><a href=\"/opinion/1634120/ibp-inc-v-klumpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n478 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2001, pet. denied). Here, Grant was charged with two felonies: attempted\n\nbribery and tampering with a witness. In his pleadings and at trial, however, Grant sued for malicious\n\nprosecution based on the attempted bribery charge only. With regard to recovering attorneys’ fees\n\nfor the malicious prosecution as damages, Grant’s attorney testified at trial that Grant incurred\n\n$6,003.19 in attorneys’ fees for defending against both charges, but that 95% of the work—or\n\n$5,703—would have been necessary for defending the attempted bribery charge alone. The jury,\n\nhowever, found Grant incurred $60,000 in reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees defending\n\nagainst the malicious prosecution. The trial court, in accordance with Grant’s voluntary remittitur,\n\nreduced this amount to $5,703 to conform to the evidence at trial. Appellants nevertheless contend\n\nthere is insufficient evidence to support the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded as damages.\n\n               Appellants do not challenge the reasonableness of the fees. Rather, they argue only\n\nthat a “reasonable fact-finder could not have . . . allocated 95 percent of the fees incurred on both\n\ncharges solely to attempted bribery.” We disagree. Submitting to the jury an attorney’s testimony\n\nconcerning the percentage of hours relating to specific claims—even a percentage a high as 95%—is\n\n                                                  28\n\fsufficient to satisfy a party’s burden to segregate its attorneys’ fees.

Further, to the extent attorneys’ fees “would have been incurred on a\n\nrecoverable claim alone, they are not disallowed simply because they do double service” with a\n\nnon-recoverable claim. See id. at 313. Grant’s indictments were based on the same facts and he\n\nasserted the same defense of limitations to both charges. His attorney testified that the legal work\n\nperformed for both charges was essentially the same, as he drafted the same motions, conducted the\n\nsame discovery, and attended the same hearings and meetings for both charges. As such, the attorney\n\ntestified “that 95% of the work that was required on those two charges would’ve been necessary on\n\njust the attempted bribery charge itself alone. . . . I would have done the same work on the attempted\n\nbribery charge even if there hadn’t been the attempted tampering with a witness charge.” As there\n\nwas sufficient evidence that Grant would have incurred $5,703 in attorneys’ fees on the bribery\n\ncharge alone, we conclude there is sufficient evidence to support the damages award. Finding\n\nsufficient evidence to support the award of actual damages, we overrule Appellants’ second issue\n\non appeal.\n\n\nC.     Exemplary Damages Cap\n\n               The Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code limits the maximum amount of\n\nexemplary damages a trial court can award. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.008(b). The cap,\n\nhowever, does not apply when a plaintiff seeks recovery of exemplary damages based on certain\n\nfelony criminal conduct enumerated under the statute, i.e., cap-busting conduct. Id. § 41.008(c).\n\n                                                 29\n\fOne such felony cap-busting exception—defined under Penal Code § 32.46—is when a person,\n\nwith the intent to defraud or harm any person, by deception causes another to sign or execute\n\nany document affecting the pecuniary interest of any person in the amount of $1,500 or more.\n\nId. § 41.008(c)(11); see also Tex. Penal Code § 32.46. Here, the jury made a cap-busting finding\n\nthat the Appellants, with the intent to harm Grant, caused another by deception to sign or execute\n\nhis criminal indictment for attempted bribery, and the indictment affected Grant’s pecuniary interest\n\nin the amount of $1,500 or more. Appellants contend there is legally insufficient evidence to support\n\nthis finding because: (1) an indictment is not a document affecting the pecuniary interest of any\n\nperson; and (2) there is no evidence Bennett caused anyone to sign the indictment.\n\n\n               1.      Document Affecting Pecuniary Interest\n\n               Appellants first contend that indictments—as a matter of law—are not documents\n\nthat affect a defendant’s pecuniary interest, and therefore Grant cannot qualify for the cap-busting\n\nexception. We are not persuaded by Appellants’ argument. The term “pecuniary interest” is not\n\ndefined by the statute; therefore, courts have defined the term using its common meaning of having a\n\n“financial stake” in a matter. See Briones v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2335360\"><a href=\"/opinion/2335360/briones-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 595 (Tex.

He then was required to obtain legal counsel to quash the\n\nindictment, incurring an additional $5,703 in attorneys’ fees. Further, if convicted of the offense of\n\n\n\n                                                   31\n\fattempted bribery, Grant faced further potential liability as the offense carried a monetary penalty\n\nof up to $10,000.

Thus, we conclude there is legally\n\nsufficient evidence Grant had a financial stake in the indictment, as the execution of the document\n\ncaused him both immediate financial liability and potential financial liability in the future.\n\n\n                2.      Causation\n\n                Appellants next contend that Bennett cannot be the legal cause of Grant’s indictment\n\nbecause (1) the causal link between Bennett’s actions and the indictment is too attenuated to\n\nsatisfy causation requirements under the Penal Code; and (2) it is impossible to prove causation\n\nbecause “grand jury proceedings are secret, so there is no way of knowing which evidence\n\npersuaded the grand jury to indict.” Criminal liability is predicated on but-for causation but also\n\nrequires consideration of the foreseeability of the injurious consequences of the defendant’s conduct.\n\nWilliams v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440936\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440936/williams-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764–65 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Appellants, relying on the\n\nTexas Court of Criminal Appeals’ discussion of causation in Williams v. State, argue the chain of\n\ncausation linking Bennett to the indictment is too attenuated to impose criminal responsibility. In\n\nWilliams, the Court found that a mother who left her two daughters in a room with a lit candle under\n\nanother adult’s supervision was not criminally responsible for the children’s burning deaths because\n\nit was not reasonably foreseeable: (1) that the other adult would forget to blow the candle out before\n\nfalling asleep; (2) that a sheet or clothing would then fall on the burning candle; and (3) that the\n\nother adult would not be able to get children out of the house after the fire started. Id. In this excerpt\n\nfrom their brief, Appellants argue the following is the but-for causal chain linking Bennett to\n\nGrant’s indictment in this case:\n\n                                                   32\n\f       •       If Bennett had not asked for a special prosecutor, and\n\n       •       If Bennett had not given the prosecutor the facts he had gathered, and\n\n       •       If the prosecutor had not brought the case to the grand jury, and possibly,\n\n       •       If the prosecutor had not presented those facts, and, possibly,\n\n       •       If the grand jury had not relied on those facts, and\n\n       •       If the prosecutor had not recommended an indictment or the grand jury had not\n               disregarded the prosecutor’s recommendation, and\n\n       •       If at least nine of the grand jurors had not voted to issue the indictment,\n\n       •       Then Grant never would have been indicted.\n\n\nAppellants then argue this causal chain is similar to Williams because it “is too disconnected from\n\nthe putative cause to support any finding” of causation. What Appellants fail to account for, however,\n\nis that the Court in Williams found that causal link insufficient because the events leading to the\n\nchildren’s deaths were “not reasonably foreseeable.” Id. at 765 (emphasis added). The facts of\n\nthis case are much different. The evidence in this case reflects that Bennett set out on a course of\n\nconduct to have Grant indicted and was successful in that endeavor. Indeed, Appellants do not\n\ncontest the jury’s finding that Bennett intended to harm Grant by causing the grand jury to sign his\n\nindictment. It is reasonably foreseeable that if Bennett intended to put Grant in prison, then provided\n\nevidence that a reasonable juror could infer was fabricated or manipulated, and then led a campaign\n\nto have a special prosecutor appointed in the case—all of which is more than adequately supported\n\nby the record—the end result of these efforts would be Grant’s indictment. It is abundantly apparent\n\nthat Grant’s indictment was the natural, probable and foreseeable consequence of Bennett’s actions.\n\n\n\n                                                  33\n\f               Appellants next contend that “Grant could not have sustained his burden to prove\n\ncausation because it is impossible to show that Bennett’s conduct was necessary for the indictment\n\nto issue [given that] grand jury proceedings are secret.” First, as we have already discussed, there\n\nwas sufficient evidence that but for Bennett’s aggressive and untoward efforts to improperly\n\ninfluence the criminal justice system, the case would have never been put before the grand jury,\n\nnot once, but twice. Further, Bennett does not dispute the jury’s finding that he used deception to\n\ncause the grand jury to execute the indictment. Deception is defined, as “creating or confirming by\n\nwords or conduct a false impression of law or fact that is likely to affect the judgment of another\n\nin the transaction, and that the actor does not believe is true.” Tex. Penal Code §§ 31.01(1)(A),\n\n32.46(d)(1). Here, the special prosecutor testified candidly that he had the following evidence\n\nfrom Bennett—at the time he presented the indictments—from which the jury found Bennett used\n\ndeception to create a false impression that was likely to affect the judgment of another: Bennett’s\n\nstatements that Grant had called trying to sell him incriminating photos for $5,000 and a transcript\n\nfrom Bennett—which the jury could have found was fraudulent—purportedly transcribing a secretly-\n\ntaped conversation with Grant that substantiated Bennett’s claim that Grant had sought $5,000 for\n\nthe photos. The record further reflects that Bennett testified at the grand jury proceeding but that\n\nGrant was not present. In exact accordance with Bennett’s evidence, the grand jury’s indictment\n\ncharges that Grant “with the specific intent to commit the offense of bribery, called [Bennett], with\n\nthe purpose of soliciting a bribe of $5,000.”\n\n               Under the Penal Code, “a person is criminally responsible if the result would not\n\nhave occurred but for his conduct, operating either alone or concurrently with another cause,\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\funless the concurrent cause was clearly sufficient to produce the result and the conduct of the actor\n\nclearly insufficient.” Tex. Penal Code § 6.04. Here, Appellants do not challenge the jury’s finding\n\nthat Bennett used deception to indict Grant, and the allegations in the indictment identically mirror\n\nthe evidence provided by Bennett. Under this record, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury’s\n\nfinding of causation, there is more than a scintilla of evidence in the record that Bennett’s conduct\n\nalone was sufficient to have caused the indictment and to incur criminal responsibility. See id.\n\nHaving found sufficient evidence to support the jury’s cap-busting finding, we overrule Appellants’\n\nthird issue on appeal.\n\n\nD.      Constitutionality of Exemplary Damages\n\n                Appellants lastly attack the award of exemplary damages, contending the dual\n\n$1 million exemplary damages awards against Bennett and the Bonham Corporation violate their\n\nfederal substantive due process rights. While state law governs the amount properly awarded as\n\nexemplary damages, that amount is also subject to an ultimate federal constitutional check for\n\nexorbitancy. Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 307. This is because the Due Process Clause of\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from imposing a “grossly excessive” punishment on a\n\ntortfeasor.

But punitive damages “may\n\nproperly be imposed to further a State’s legitimate interests in punishing unlawful conduct and\n\ndeterring its repetition,” and “States necessarily have considerable flexibility in determining the\n\nlevel of punitive damages that they will allow in different classes of cases and in any particular case.”\n\nId. at 568. “Only when an award can be categorized as grossly excessive in relation to these interests\n\ndoes it enter the zone of arbitrariness that violates” due process.

Reprehensibility of Bennett’s Misconduct\n\n               The first guidepost, the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant’s misconduct,\n\nfocuses on the “enormity” of the misconduct and is “the most important indicium of the reasonableness\n\nof a punitive damages award.” BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 575. Punitive damages are not\n\ncompensation for injury; rather, they operate as private fines intended to punish the defendant and\n\nto deter future wrongdoing. Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Grp., Inc., 532 U.S.424, 432\n\n(2001). Exemplary damages should therefore reflect the “enormity of [the] offense.” BMW of N. Am.,\n\n                                                  36\n\f517 U.S. at 575. In evaluating the enormity of a person’s misconduct, we consider five nonexclusive\n\nfactors— whether:\n\n\n       1.      The harm inflicted was physical rather than economic;\n\n       2.      The tortious conduct showed an indifference to or reckless disregard for the\n               health or safety of others;\n\n       3.      The target of the conduct had financial vulnerability;\n\n       4.      The conduct involved repeated actions, not just an isolated incident; and\n\n       5.      The harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, as opposed to\n               mere accident.\n\n\nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538 U.S. at 419. One of these reprehensibility factors alone “may\n\nnot be sufficient to sustain a punitive damages award; and the absence of all of them renders any\n\naward suspect.” Id.\n\n\n               a.      Harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery or deceit.\n\n               Appellants concede there is evidence that Grant’s indictment resulted from “intentional\n\nmalice, trickery, or deceit” but argue that none of the other factors weigh in favor of punitive\n\ndamages. We certainly agree with Appellants that the fifth reprehensibility factor weighs in favor\n\nof punitive damages. The jury heard evidence that Bennett’s goal was to put Grant in prison to settle\n\na personal vendetta and to influence pending civil litigation, and that he set out on a campaign of\n\nlegal thuggery—including allegations of lying, tailoring evidence, and even outright fabrication of\n\nevidence—to ensure that Grant was imprisoned. When Bennett could not win at this game, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 37\n\frecord reflects he decided to change the playing field by exerting political pressure on a district\n\nattorney to appoint his own hand-picked special prosecutor to the case.\n\n                Further, when considering exemplary damages, we may examine Bennett’s misconduct\n\nbeyond the malicious prosecution itself when it “demonstrates the deliberateness and culpability”\n\nof his actions and bears “a nexus to the specific harm suffered” by Grant. Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d\n\nat 875. Here, Bennett’s efforts to manipulate the legal system to imprison Grant were part of a\n\nlarger escapade designed to thwart justice and abuse the court system. We conclude the following\n\nallegations of malfeasance may properly inform the reprehensibility analysis, as they demonstrate\n\nthe deliberateness, culpability, and motive behind Bennett’s actions and relate back to the underlying\n\nmalicious prosecution:\n\n       Urging Grant to Lie and Attempting to Bribe Him. Grant testified that, prior to turning his\nphotos over to the authorities, Bennett visited his home and urged him to lie about what he had seen.\nGrant’s sister testified that Bennett then attempted to offer Grant a lucrative job under the guise of\nhelping his family after a car accident. She testified Bennett offered that if Grant “can come and help\nhim for a couple of days, he had a job that he can get $4,000 for . . . a couple of days of work.”\nWhen Grant had worked for Bennett the previous year, his salary was $1,100 a month. At the time\nBennett offered this money, Grant was posed to be the star witness testifying against Bennett in his\ncriminal trial for cattle theft and in Reynolds’ civil suit.\n\n         Threatening Grant. When money was not enough to persuade Grant, there was evidence at\ntrial that Bennett then tried a new tactic to silence Grant. Grant’s sister testified that Bennett called\nher more than 15 times trying to obtain Grant’s new contact information. Frustrated that Bennett\nwould not stop calling, the sister provided Bennett with her husband’s cell phone number and\nsaid it was Grant’s number. Bennett testified that he then asked Rogers to call the number. Shortly\nthereafter, Rogers called the number and reached Grant’s brother-in-law. Believing he was speaking\nto Grant, Rogers then—according to the brother-in-law—demanded that Grant turn over the pictures\nand threatened “if he didn’t get the pictures, that he had a jake-leg lawyer that would obtain them”\nand “that he was going to take care of [Grant] one way or the other.” The brother-in-law testified\nthat he relayed these threats to Grant.\n\n        Litigation Against Grant. Being unsuccessful in silencing Grant, Bennett then filed this suit\nalleging Grant had slandered him by saying that he had stolen Reynolds’ cattle and sought $50,000\n\n                                                   38\n\fin damages. The jury found against Bennett on his slander claim, finding that Grant’s statement that\nBennett had stolen from Reynolds was substantially true. In addition to this suit, Bennett filed—the\nday after Grant’s criminal record was expunged—a second civil lawsuit against Grant and others\nalleging they had conspired to have him indicted for cattle theft. Bennett sought $2 million dollars\nin compensatory damages, in addition to punitive damages, in that suit.15\n\n        Pressuring Grant’s Attorney to Resign. During the course of this litigation, Bennett filed two\ngrievances against Grant’s attorney that were dismissed as not alleging professional misconduct. In\naddition to the grievances, Bennett sued Grant’s lawyer, contending he had conspired with Grant and\nothers to have him indicted for cattle theft. The attorney testified that after he was sued by Bennett\nfor $2 million, he was “angry” and “scared” and decided to no longer represent Grant in this suit\nbecause “he couldn’t do as good a job as somebody that wasn’t being sued themselves.”\n\n        Tampering With Evidence. At trial, there were allegations that one of the photos Grant had\ntaken depicted Reynolds’ brand on the sold cattle. There were further allegations that Bennett had\ndoctored this photo during his criminal trial to change the incriminating image of his neighbor’s\nbrand and conceal his theft. In addition, the San Saba District and County Clerk testified that\nBennett attempted to register Reynolds’ brand as his own. Finally, during the course of this trial,\nBennett—outside the presence of the jury and without permission from the trial court—altered an\nexhibit depicting a hand-drawn diagram of Reynolds’ brand. We conclude these cover-up efforts show\nculpability and deliberateness and sought to extend and exacerbate harm to Grant by discrediting\nhim as a witness and bolstering Bennett’s claims in his civil lawsuits against Grant.16\n\n\n               b.      Harm inflicted was not merely an economic injury and showed a reckless\n                       disregard for Grant’s health and safety.\n\n               Regarding the first and second reprehensibility factors, Appellants argue Grant\n\nsuffered a purely economic injury and this is not a case involving physical harm warranting a\n\ngreater award of exemplary damages, and that his actions do not show an indifference to or\n\n\n\n       15\n          Grant, Reynolds, and Miller obtained a favorable summary judgment and sanctions against\nBennett, Bonham, and their attorney in that suit, which is currently pending on appeal before this\nCourt in Bennett, Bonham & Paris v. Reynolds, No. 03-12-00568.\n       16\n          An award of punitive damages for some of these actions has already been awarded against\nBennett in Bennett I. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 876. In that suit, however, he was punished for\nhow his actions affected Reynolds. In this suit, the award of punitive damages is to punish Bennett\nfor how these actions affected Grant.

Malicious prosecution is not a purely\n\neconomic injury; rather, the Restatement recognizes that a plaintiff may recover for the physical\n\nharm caused by reason of his arrest. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 671 (1977). Here, Bennett\n\ndid not intend to inflict a mere financial injury on Grant; rather, he succeeded in having Grant’s\n\nactual person seized, held in captivity, and stripped of personal liberties. Appellants further contend\n\nthat: “Bennett’s mere desire that Grant serve prison time does not equate to indifference or reckless\n\ndisregard for Grant’s health or safety. . . . At best, this factor is neutral and therefore carries no\n\nweight in the reprehensibility analysis.” We are confident that if Bennett himself or any person\n\nwere arrested and facing a prison sentence in Texas, he would not view his health and safety\n\nneutrally affected. See also id. (maliciously prosecuted plaintiff may recover for impairment to\n\nhealth sustained from arrest).\n\n\n               c.      Target of the conduct had financial vulnerability.\n\n               Regarding the third reprehensibility factor, we note that Bennett’s actions were further\n\nreprehensible because Bennett was aware that Grant and his family were financially vulnerable.\n\nGrant testified he first met Bennett because he was desperate for work, and Bennett agreed to hire\n\nhim as a hand. During the time Grant worked for Bennett, the Bonham Corporation paid him a\n\nsalary of $1,100 for a full month of work and allowed him to live in a trailer on the property. A\n\nsalary of $13,200 a year, even when the housing allowance is considered, was hovering on the\n\nfederal poverty line.17 Further, Grant’s financial situation worsened when his wife and baby were\n\n\n       17\n           Pursuant to federal poverty guidelines in 2001, a person with two dependents was poverty-\nstricken if his annual income was less than $14,630. See http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/01poverty.htm.\n\n                                                  40\n\fin a major traffic accident shortly after Grant turned his photos over to the authorities. Grant and\n\nothers testified that both his wife and baby were hospitalized after the accident, that his wife had\n\nbeen permanently injured, and that Grant had to take a significant amount of time off from work to\n\nstay home and care for her. The record reflects that Bennett was fully aware of the car accident and\n\nperhaps attempted to use the situation to take advantage of Grant’s financial vulnerability by offering\n\nhim an extremely lucrative job immediately after the accident under the guise of helping Grant’s\n\nfamily. Amidst this backdrop of financial vulnerability, Bennett then began his quest to have Grant\n\nimprisoned and ultimately indicted. Further, Grant’s indictment carried a prison sentence of two to\n\nten years’ imprisonment. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34, 15.01, 36.02. Undoubtedly, Bennett’s\n\nactions threatened to financially ruin Grant and his family.\n\n                In sum, we conclude four of the five reprehensibility factors are present in this case\n\nand weigh in favor of punitive damages: (1) the harm to Grant resulted from intentional malice,\n\ntrickery, or deceit; (2) Bennett’s malicious prosecution of Grant was not merely an economic injury\n\nbut resulted in a seizure of Grant’s person and loss of physical liberties; (3) Bennett’s tortious\n\nconduct showed an indifference to and reckless disregard for Grant’s health and safety; (4) and his\n\nactions threatened to financially ruin Grant. Thus, all but one of the reprehensibility factors weigh\n\nin favor of exemplary damages.18\n\n\n\n\n       18\n           The remaining reprehensibility factor is whether the defendant’s conduct involved repeated\nactions, not just an isolated incident. For purposes of the reprehensibility analysis, the Texas Supreme\nCourt has found that this factor refers to recidivism and not a course of conduct resulting in a single\ninjury. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 878 n.55. Here, Grant alleges Bennett engaged in a course of\nconduct resulting in a single injury—his indictment for attempted bribery. There is no evidence in\nthe record that Bennett had engaged in other acts of malicious prosecution demonstrating recidivism.\n\n                                                  41\n\f       2.      Ratio Between Exemplary and Compensatory Damages\n\n               The second and perhaps most commonly cited indicium of an excessive punitive\n\ndamages award is the ratio between the punitive damages awarded and the actual or potential harm\n\ninflicted on the plaintiff. See BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 580. In analyzing this ratio, “the proper\n\ninquiry is ‘whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the\n\nharm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred.’”\n\nId. at 581 (quoting TXO Prod.

While there is not “a mathematical bright line between the\n\nconstitutionally acceptable and constitutionally unacceptable [award of exemplary damages] that\n\nwould fit every case,” see Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112557\"><a href=\"/opinion/112557/pacific-mut-life-ins-co-v-haslip/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1991), we have been\n\ninstructed that “few awards exceeding a single-digit ratio . . . will satisfy due process” and that an\n\n“award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the line of\n\nconstitutional impropriety.” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538 U.S. at 425.\n\n               Appellants contend that there is no meaningful distinction between this case and the\n\nlarge punitive damages award the Texas Supreme Court overturned in Bennett I, in which the Court\n\nfound that the ratio of $5,327.11 in actual damages compared to the $250,000 in exemplary damages\n\nawarded against Bennett—a ratio of 47:1—and the $1 million exemplary damages awarded against\n\nBonham—a ratio of 188:1—violated due process. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 869. As the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court has recognized, however, “a jury imposing a punitive damages award must make a\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fqualitative assessment based on a host of facts and circumstances unique to the particular case before\n\nit. Because no two cases are truly identical, meaningful comparisons of such awards are difficult to\n\nmake.” TXO Prod., 509 U.S. at 458. While this case and Bennett I share some nucleus of operative\n\nfacts, the present case is distinguishable and therefore must be examined on its own facts. In Bennett\n\nI, the jury found Bennett converted thirteen of his neighbor’s cattle and assessed actual damages at\n\nthe market value of the cattle, $5,327.11. Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 871. While the Court found that\n\nBennett’s malfeasance in attempting to cover-up his initial conversion showed heightened\n\nreprehensibility, it concluded:\n\n\n               At heart, though, this is an economic-injury, actual-harm case seeking\n        recovery for the conversion of thirteen head of cattle. Reynolds alleges a broader\n        “criminal escapade” that aimed to ruin him, but the theoretical possibilities of greater\n        harm strike as marginally relevant at best in assessing exemplary damages, absent\n        proof of the likelihood of such harms.\n\n\nId. at 877.\n\n                In striking contrast, Bennett in this case did not merely steal cattle; rather, he\n\nattempted to deprive a man of two to ten years of his liberty. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34, 15.01,\n\n36.02 (sentencing for offense of attempted bribery). While Appellants attempt to equate theft of\n\ncattle to the theft of years from a man’s life, there is no comparison between the two acts. This is\n\nreflected in the reprehensibility analysis, in which we concluded that four of the five reprehensibility\n\nfactors were present in this case. In contrast, in Bennett I, the Texas Supreme Court found that\n\nBennett inflicted a purely economic injury on his neighbor by stealing his cattle and therefore\n\nonly one of the reprehensibility factors—the harm resulted from intentional malice, trickery, or\n\ndeceit—was present. See Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 877.\n\n                                                  43\n\f               Further, and perhaps most important for our discussion, the Texas Supreme Court\n\nfound that Bennett I was an actual-harm case only—meaning that beyond the actual harm suffered\n\nby Reynolds from the theft of his cattle, there was only marginal evidence of any other potential\n\nharm faced by Reynolds or anyone else as a result of Bennett’s conversion. Id. Therefore, in\n\nBennett I, potential harm was not relevant in the Court’s ratio analysis. See id. But in this case, the\n\nevidence of potential harm is not marginal or speculative; rather, the record conclusively shows that\n\nGrant would have been imprisoned for two to ten years if Bennett had succeeded in his illicit\n\nscheme. See Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.34, 15.01, 36.02. In analyzing the exemplary damages ratio in a\n\npotential-harm case, the U.S. Supreme Court has unequivocally instructed us that “[i]t is appropriate\n\nto consider the magnitude of the potential harm that the defendant’s conduct would have caused to\n\nits intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded.” TXO Prod., 509 U.S. at 460 (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (holding dramatic disparity between $19,000 compensatory damages award compared to\n\n$10 million exemplary damages award did not violate due process “in light of the [millions]\n\npotentially at stake” if the defendant “had succeeded in its illicit scheme”). Thus, U.S. Supreme Court\n\nprecedent requires us to compare the exemplary damages awarded in this case to both “the harm\n\nthat has actually occurred” and the potential harm that Grant would have sustained if Bennett’s\n\n“wrongful plan had succeeded.” See id.; see also BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 581 (“the proper\n\ninquiry is whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the\n\nharm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred”).\n\n               Appellants stress in their brief the disparity between the dual $1 million punitive\n\ndamages awarded in this case compared to the $10,703 compensatory damages award. That disparity\n\n\n\n                                                  44\n\flessens, however, when we consider the potential prison sentence faced by Grant. Although it is\n\ndifficult to place a monetary value on the loss a person experiences from losing years of his life to\n\nan erroneous prison sentence, the State compensates persons who have been wrongfully convicted\n\nto the tune of $80,000 for each year of wrongful imprisonment plus lifetime annuity payments.\n\nSee Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 103.052 (Lump-Sum Compensation), 103.053 (Annuity\n\nCompensation). Thus, if Grant had been wrongfully imprisoned for the minimum sentence of two\n\nyears’ imprisonment, he would have been entitled at a bare minimum to a lump-sum payment of\n\n$160,000.19 And, on the high end of the spectrum, he would have been entitled to a lump-sum\n\npayment of $800,000 for serving the maximum ten-year sentence, plus potential lifetime annuity\n\npayments which could potentially push the final award to over $1 million.20 Although there is no\n\nway to precisely put a dollar value on the potential harm in this case, the State’s restitution payments\n\nreflect the value the Legislature has placed on a year of life lost to wrongful imprisonment and\n\nprovide a guidepost for the potential damages in this case.\n\n                Based on this analysis, we conclude the potential damages in this case can be\n\nprudently and rationally valued at a minimum of $160,000. This is the minimum amount Grant\n\nwould have received from the State if he had been wrongfully convicted of attempted bribery and\n\nserved the minimum sentence available. When combined with the actual damages, the total actual\n\n       19\n         Annuity payments would not begin until the first anniversary of this lump-sum payment\nand would be awarded only if Grant was still living on that date. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n§§ 103.151(b), 103.154(b).\n       20\n           The annuity payments are somewhat speculative as they are determined by the number\nof years a person survives after release from prison. See id. § 103.154(b). Unlike the lump-sum\ncompensation, the annuity payments do not transfer upon death to the person’s estate. See id.\n§§ 103.151(a), 103.154(b).\n\n                                                  45\n\fand potential damages for this case would therefore be at least $170,703. Using these figures, the\n\nratio between the actual and potential harm compared to the dual $1 million exemplary damages\n\nawards would be over 5:1 for both Bennett and Bonham. See BMW of N. Am., 517 U.S. at 581 (“the\n\nproper inquiry is whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and\n\nthe harm likely to result from the defendant’s conduct as well as the harm that actually has\n\noccurred”). We note that—even with careful consideration of both the actual and potential damages\n\nin this case—this ratio likely exceeds constitutional limits. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538 U.S.\n\nat 425 (“award of more than four times the amount of compensatory damages might be close to the\n\nline of constitutional impropriety”). As such, this guidepost weighs in favor of reducing the punitive\n\ndamages award.\n\n\n       3.      Legislative Penalties for Similar Misconduct\n\n               The final guidepost compares the exemplary damages with legislatively authorized\n\ncivil penalties in comparable cases. This factor fortifies the notion that legislatures make policy and\n\nare well positioned to define and deter undesired behavior. Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 880. Here, we\n\nnote there is no comparable civil penalty for Bennett’s conduct. We may, however, also look to\n\ncriminal penalties that could be imposed, as “the existence of a criminal penalty does have bearing\n\non the seriousness with which a State views the wrongful action.” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 538\n\nU.S. at 428. When used to determine the dollar amount of an exemplary damages award, though,\n\nthe U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned us that criminal penalties have “less utility” than\n\ncivil penalties. See id.; see also Bennett I, 315 S.W.3d at 881. In this case, we conclude criminal\n\n\n\n\n                                                  46\n\fpenalties have some relevance to our discussion, as they demonstrate that Bennett had fair notice that\n\nhis conduct could subject him to the following punishment:\n\n\n        •       Tampering With or Fabricating Physical Evidence\n\n                •         2 to 10 Year Prison Sentence\n                •         $10,000 fine\n\n        •       Aggravated Perjury Before Grand Jury\n\n                •         2 to 10 Year Prison Sentence\n                •         $10,000 fine\n\n        •       Execution of a Document by Deception\n\n                •         180 days to 2 years in State Jail\n                •         $10,000 fine\n\n        •       Making a False Report to Peace Officer or Law Enforcement Employee\n\n                •         Up to 180 Days in State Jail\n                •         $2,000 fine\n                •         $16,000 fine for committing offense eight times21\n\n\nThus, Bennett had fair notice of the seriousness with which the State viewed his wrongful conduct,\n\nas his actions could subject him to up to $46,000 in monetary fines and four to twenty-two\n\nyears’ incarceration.22\n\n                Appellants contend in their brief that we should—as we did on remand from\n\nBennett I—reduce the exemplary damages award to the comparable criminal fines. In that case, we\n\n\n\n       21\n           Bennett acknowledged at trial that, in his efforts to prosecute Grant, he spoke with at least\neight different law enforcement officials on separate occasions.\n        22\n           See Tex. Penal Code §§ 32.46 (execution of document by deception), 38.03 (aggravated\nperjury), 37.09 (evidence tampering), 37.08 (false report).\n\n                                                    47\n\fconcluded that the criminal monetary sanction for cattle theft was comparable to the civil offense\n\nof conversion and provided an objective basis for setting a constitutionally permissible exemplary\n\ndamages award.

While we can examine specific criminal\n\nactions Bennett took in his ultimate effort to maliciously prosecute Grant, none of these offenses take\n\ninto account that Bennett’s ultimate goal was to put Grant in prison.23 We do, however, conclude\n\nthat under this record the applicable prison sentences and fines put Bennett on notice that the State\n\nhas a significant interest in deterring this type of conduct and would prosecute and imprison those\n\nwho attempt to manipulate the criminal justice system for personal gain.\n\n               After careful analysis of these three guideposts, we conclude: (1) four of the five\n\nreprehensibility factors weigh in favor of punitive damages; (2) potential harm is relevant in\n\nevaluating the ratio to exemplary damages, but that even when we consider potential harm, the\n\nresulting ratio of 5:1 likely exceeds constitutional boundaries; and (3) there are no comparable\n\ncivil sanctions, but Bennett was on notice that the State had a significant interest in protecting the\n\n\n\n\n       23\n             In truth, for most cases the monetary criminal penalties under the Texas Penal Code have\nlittle utility in determining the dollar value of an exemplary damages award.

The monetary penalty for all felonies in Texas,\nexcept for capital felony offenses which do not carry any monetary penalty, is a fine not to exceed\n$10,000. Tex. Penal Code §§ 12.31–.35. There is no variance in the amount of the fine to account\nfor the State’s varied interests in preventing and punishing various degrees of reprehensible felony\nconduct.\n\n                                                  48\n\fintegrity of the criminal justice system and would vigorously prosecute, fine, and imprison persons\n\nwho engaged in such behavior.\n\n               Our remaining task is to determine—under the unique facts of this case and these\n\nguideposts—what amount of exemplary damages would pass constitutional muster. In this regard,\n\nwe have been instructed that an award “four times the amount of compensatory damages might\n\nbe close to the line of constitutional impropriety” and that “[p]ushing exemplary damages to the\n\nabsolute constitutional limit in a case like this leaves no room for greater punishment in cases\n\ninvolving death, grievous physical injury, financial ruin, or actions that endanger a large segment of\n\nthe public.” Tony Gullo Motors I, 212 S.W.3d at 308–310. While we find Bennett’s conduct\n\nabhorrent, we recognize that his actions did not actually cause any of these enumerated unfortunate\n\ncircumstances. We do, however, also recognize that the State has a significant interest in punishing\n\nand deterring this type of conduct and that Bennett’s actions were particularly reprehensible.\n\nWeighing these competing concerns, we conclude that a ratio of 3:1 exemplary damages compared\n\nto the combined actual and potential damages passes constitutional muster. This results in an award\n\nof $512,109 against each defendant (three times the actual and potential damages of $170,703) and\n\nreduces the total punitive damages award from $2 million to $1,024,218 ($512,109 against Bonham\n\nand $512,109 against Bennett).24 This award recognizes the potential harm caused by Bennett and\n\n\n\n\n       24\n          When corporate liability is warranted based on the actions of a vice-principal, the Texas\nSupreme Court has affirmed the propriety of awarding exemplary damages against both the individual\nvice-principal and his employer.

Chapter 10 of the Civil\n\nPractice and Remedies Code, in pertinent part, authorizes a court to sanction a person, a party\n\nwho represents the person, or both for signing a pleading that was brought for any improper\n\npurpose—including to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.\n\nTex.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, pet. denied) (“Sanctions under\n\nchapter 10 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code are authorized if the evidence establishes that\n\n. . . a pleading or motion was brought for an improper purpose.”). Here, the trial court’s order\n\nconcludes that Bennett filed his slander claim for at least two improper purposes—“to punish\n\na witness who had testified against him in previous lawsuits” and “to subvert a separate trial,\n\n[Bennett I].” The trial court further concluded that Bennett’s refusal to nonsuit his slander claim,\n\n“substantially increased the burden on this case on the defendant and on the court system” and\n\n“required in essence a re-trial of [Bennett I].” As the trial court made findings that Bennett filed\n\nthis suit for improper purposes specifically prohibited by Chapter 10, we conclude the trial court\n\ncould have relied on Chapter 10 as the legal basis for the award. Further, Bennett has not challenged\n\non appeal the trial court’s finding that he filed this suit against Grant for improper purposes.\n\n\n\n                                                   51\n\fGenerally, an appellant must attack all independent bases or grounds that fully support a complained-\n\nof ruling or judgment. See Britton , 95 S.W.3d at 681. As Bennett has failed to attack this basis that\n\nsupports the sanctions order, we cannot conclude the trial court’s imposition of sanctions was an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n                In addition, Rule 13 similarly authorizes a trial court to sanction a person, a\n\nrepresented party, or both for signing a pleading that is groundless and brought in bad faith or to\n\nharass. Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. Pleadings are presumed filed in good faith under Rule 13, and the burden\n\nis on the moving party to demonstrate both that the opposing party’s filings: (1) are groundless;\n\nand (2) were filed either in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. Id. In determining whether\n\nsanctions are appropriate, the trial court must examine the facts available to the litigant and the\n\ncircumstances existing when the litigant filed the pleading. Robson, 267 S.W.3d at 409. Further,\n\nunder Rule 13, the trial court is required to state in the order the particulars of good cause justifying\n\nthe sanctions. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 13.\n\n                The trial court’s order here concludes, consistent with a violation of Rule 13, that\n\nBennett’s slander claim was “groundless,” “part of a plan to harass and intimidate Grant,” and\n\nbrought in “bad faith.”25 As such, we conclude that Rule 13 could have also been the legal basis for\n\nthe trial court’s award. Further, the sanctions order states the particulars of good cause justifying\n\nsanctions under Rule 13. First, there are numerous findings in the order that Bennett brought this\n\n\n        25\n           The trial court also submitted this question to the jury, which concluded that Bennett’s\nsuit was groundless and brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment. Bennett contends the\ntrial court erred in submitting the sanctions issue to the jury because it was a question of law.\nRegardless, the sanctions order indicates the trial court made its own findings to support the\nsanctions order separate from the jury’s findings.\n\n                                                   52\n\fsuit in bad faith and for purposes of harassment, including findings that: (1) Bennett had filed this\n\nsuit to punish Grant for testifying against him in previous lawsuits; (2) Bennett had “doctored” or\n\n“altered” evidence to cover up his conversion of Reynolds’ cattle and give grounds to his baseless\n\nslander claim against Grant; (3) and that Bennett’s true purpose in the suit was not to recover money\n\ndamages from Grant—who lacked the financial resources to pay an award—but to subvert a separate\n\ncivil trial, Bennett I, and to harass Grant. Bennett does not challenge the legal sufficiency of any of\n\nthese findings on appeal.\n\n                With regard to groundlessness, Bennett pleaded that he had instructed Grant not to\n\nsell any cattle that did not belong to him, and therefore, Grant’s allegation that he had stolen the\n\ncattle was slander. The trial court, however, found in its order that Bennett had converted Reynolds’\n\ncattle and then engaged in a “design to cover up his conversion” that implied “willfulness and bad\n\nfaith, not inadvertence or an honest mistake.” This finding states with particularity the trial court’s\n\ngood cause for concluding the slander claim was groundless—as the trial court found there was\n\nno factual basis to support Bennett’s pleadings that Reynolds’ cattle had been sold accidentally\n\nand there was no legal basis for his slander claim because substantial truth is a complete defense\n\nto slander. See id. (groundless means no basis in law or fact and not warranted by good faith\n\nargument for change of existing law); see also Randall’s Food Mkt., Inc. v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1504334\"><a href=\"/opinion/1504334/randalls-food-markets-inc-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646 (Tex. 1995) (substantial truth of an alleged defamatory statement is complete defense to\n\nslander action). Further, while Bennett testified in support of his allegations, the trial court does not\n\nabuse its discretion when there is conflicting evidence that supports its decision, see Unifund CCR\n\nPartners, 299 S.W.3d at 97, and Bennett has not challenged the legal sufficiency of this finding on\n\n\n\n                                                   53\n\fappeal. In addition, the trial court finds in its order that Bennett’s deceit in covering up his\n\nwrongdoing by doctoring or altering evidence, “confirms the groundlessness of the slander claim”\n\nand was to “further his attempts to give grounds to his baseless harassment of Grant.” As such, we\n\ncannot agree with Bennett’s contention in his brief that the sanctions order “fails to state good cause\n\nfor finding groundlessness with the particularity Rule 13 requires.” Rather, we conclude the\n\nsanctions order states with particularity the reasons and circumstances justifying the trial court’s\n\nfinding of good cause to issue sanctions under Rule 13.26\n\n               Bennett further contends the award of sanctions against him individually was an\n\nabuse of discretion because his lawyer signed and filed his pleadings, and “a party should not be\n\nsanctioned for its attorney’s conduct unless the party is implicated apart from having entrusted its\n\nlegal representation to counsel.” See Loeffler v. Lytle Indep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1791425\"><a href=\"/opinion/1791425/loeffler-v-lytle-independent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">211</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349–50\n\n\n\n\n       26\n           On rehearing, Bennett contends for the first time that “Grant never noticed any formal\nhearing on his request for sanctions.” See Tex. R. Civ. P. 13 (sanctions may be imposed upon\nmotion or upon court’s own initiative, after notice and hearing); Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n§ 10.002–3 (same). The record, however, shows that Bennett’s counsel was served with notice of\nthe sanctions hearing. Moreover, “the proper method to preserve [Bennett’s] notice complaint was\nto bring the lack of adequate notice to the attention of the trial court at the hearing, object to the\nhearing going forward, and/or move for a continuance.” See Low v. Henry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894843\"><a href=\"/opinion/894843/low-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 618\n(Tex. 2007). Bennett additionally complains on rehearing that “Grant never filed a formal motion\nfor sanctions.” Bennett failed to raise this issue at the trial court or in his appeal. Grant did plead\nfor attorneys’ fees based on Bennett’s filing of a groundless claim, and the trial court had submitted\na jury question asking whether Bennett’s slander claim was groundless and brought in bad faith or\nfor purposes of harassment. The jury answered affirmatively. Grant then moved the court to enter\nfinal judgment sanctioning Bennett for filing a groundless claim brought in bad or for purposes of\nharassment. Prior to the court’s sanctions order, Bennett also filed a brief with the court contending\nthat he should not be sanctioned because his claims were not groundless nor brought in bad faith or\nfor purposes of harassment. Thus, on the record, Grant moved the trial court to issue sanctions and\nBennett plainly had notice of the grounds on which Grant was seeking sanctions and an opportunity\nto respond.\n\n                                                  54\n\f(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2006, pet. denied). Again, we disagree. While Bennett’s attorneys filed\n\nand signed his pleadings, Bennett provided the factual basis for the slander claim and authorized\n\nhis attorneys to file suit based on those allegations. Further, the trial court made several specific\n\nfindings that sanctionable conduct was attributable to Bennett himself27 and that Bennett had\n\nbrought the slander suit as revenge for Grant testifying against him in previous suits. As such, we\n\ncannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in finding that Bennett was implicated in the\n\nsanctionable conduct. Concluding he has failed to prove on appeal that the trial court’s award of\n\nsanctions was arbitrary or unreasonable, we overrule Bennett’s sole individual issue on appeal.28\n\n\n\n\n       27\n           The trial court’s order provides many instances of Bennett personally implicating\nhimself, including one instance where he—outside the presence of the jury—altered a hand-drawn\nexhibit depicting Reynolds’ brand. When confronted about the alteration, Bennett claimed he\nwas merely highlighting the exhibit so the jury could see it better, and that it was okay because\nthe Judge was in the courtroom when he made the alteration. The trial court notes in its order that\n“although the Judge was present in the room, such alteration was not observed or sanctioned by\nanyone, the Court included.” In addition to the sanctions expressly authorized by Rule 13 and\nChapter 10, the trial court has the inherent power to sanction such bad faith conduct that occurs\nduring the course of litigation.

See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 10.004(c)(3); Tex. R. Civ. P. 13. Bennett\nhas not raised any challenge to the amount of the award on appeal. On rehearing, Bennett contends\nhe is entitled to remand to allow the trial court to reconsider the amount of the award in light of the\nTexas Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Nath v. Texas Children’s Hospital. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">355</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n372 (Tex. 2014) (holding that sanctions were warranted but remand was necessary to determine\nwhether, by litigating for over four years before seeking sanctions, the moving party bore some\nresponsibility for the attorneys’ fees it incurred). In Nath, however, the sanctioned party preserved\nerror by challenging the excessiveness of the attorneys’ fees at the trial court and on appeal. See\n446 S.W.3d at 361, 364. Here, Bennett did not raise the issue of excessiveness at the trial court nor\non appeal. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude he is entitled to remand under Nath.\n\n                                                  55\n\f                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               This is an unusual case. Malicious prosecution itself is an unusual tort, and it is\n\nexceptionally unique under Texas jurisprudence for a defendant to procure a prosecution by both\n\nproviding false information to authorities and by engaging in such other improper activities that his\n\nconduct became the determining factor in the decision to prosecute. Looking to the exemplary\n\ndamages award, this case is also unique because another exemplary damages award, in Bennett I,\n\nhas already been adjudicated by the Texas Supreme Court and found unconstitutional. The facts\n\nand circumstances of this case, however, are vastly different than those in Bennett I and justify the\n\nimposition of a larger exemplary damages award. This case differs from Bennett I—and again is\n\nsomewhat unique under Texas jurisprudence—because it is a potential-harm case and all but one of\n\nthe five reprehensibility factors are present. As remitted, we are confident the exemplary damages\n\naward passes constitutional muster under current federal standards.29 Accordingly, we reform the\n\ntrial court's judgment to award Grant $512,109 in exemplary damages against Bennett and $512,109\n\nin exemplary damages against Bonham. We affirm the trial court's judgment as reformed.\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n\n                                              Scott K.
