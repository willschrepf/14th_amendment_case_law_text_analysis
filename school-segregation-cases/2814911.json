D-1-GN-02-004226, HONORABLE GISELA D. TRIANA, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\n               Appellants James Sylvester, Ken Yarborough, and Josephine Miller, candidates for\n\nthe Texas House of Representatives in the 2002 general election, brought suit against appellees\n\nTexas Association of Business (TAB), Bill Hammond, the Texas Business and Commerce Political\n\nAction Committee (BACPAC), CIGNA Healthcare of Texas, Inc., and Connecticut General Life\n\nInsurance Company, alleging Election Code violations. Appellants sought damages based on “voter\n\neducation” mailers that TAB disseminated and alleged in-kind political contributions from TAB to\n\nBACPAC during the 2002 general election cycle. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.131, 254.231. The\n\ntrial court granted final summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, appellants raise six\n\nissues challenging the judgment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.1\n\n\n       1\n          We grant appellants’ motion for leave to file supplemental brief and appellees CIGNA\nHealthcare of Texas, Inc. and Connecticut General Life Insurance Company’s motion for leave to\nfile supplemental authority.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               TAB is a non-profit corporation whose stated mission is “to build the best business\n\nclimate on the planet through legislative action on the state and federal levels.” TAB “lobbies on\n\nevery issue that impacts business to ensure that employers’ opinions are being heard.” Bill Hammond\n\nis TAB’s president and chief executive officer.\n\n               A few months before the 2002 general election, TAB solicited money from\n\ncorporations to fund a “voter education project.”          Hammond sent a memorandum dated\n\nAugust 22, 2002, to “Texas Business Leaders.” He stated that the goal was to raise one-million\n\ndollars and that “[o]ur strategy [was] simple: to educate voters about pro-business candidates through\n\nan aggressive direct mail program.” He also informed the corporations that “[c]ontributions for this\n\npurpose [were] not reportable” and provided an opinion letter from a Texas ethics attorney\n\n“regarding the legality of corporate expenditures for voter education programs.” In his letter, the\n\nattorney stated that corporate expenditures for “issue ads” were not reportable to the Texas Ethics\n\nCommission (TEC) or “any other governmental body.” In response, corporations, including CIGNA\n\nand CT General, contributed money to TAB in excess of $1.8 million for the “voter education\n\nproject.” TAB spent these funds to disseminate mailers that specifically addressed candidates for the\n\nTexas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate.\n\n               TAB also sponsors BACPAC, a voluntary, non-profit unincorporated political\n\ncommittee. TAB did not appoint a campaign treasurer or file reports with the TEC during the 2002\n\nelection cycle, but BACPAC did. BACPAC accepted and made campaign contributions in the 2002\n\ngeneral election, disclosing the contributions in reports filed with the TEC.\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fLitigation Commenced\n\n               Appellants brought this suit in 2002 seeking damages under the Election Code based\n\non the “voter education” mailers and alleged services provided by TAB employees to BACPAC.\n\nSee Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.131, 254.231.2 Appellants were unsuccessful candidates for the Texas\n\nHouse of Representatives in the 2002 general election.3 Some of the mailers provided information\n\nconcerning the positions of appellants, their opponents, or both on specific issues.\n\n               Appellants contended that TAB violated provisions of the Election Code that apply\n\nto corporations and provisions that apply to political committees. Appellants alleged that “TAB\n\nconstituted a political committee under the election code” by collecting funds and then spending\n\nthem in support or in opposition to various legislative candidates. See id. § 251.001(12) (defining\n\n“political committee”).4 Appellants urged that, as a political committee, TAB accepted illegal\n\npolitical contributions and made illegal political expenditures because it did not have a campaign\n\n\n       2\n           Section 253.131(a) of the Election Code reads: “A person who knowingly makes or\naccepts a campaign contribution or makes a campaign expenditure in violation of this chapter is\nliable for damages as provided in this section.” Tex. Elec. Code § 253.131(a). Section 254.231(a)\nof the Election Code similarly states:\n\n       A candidate or campaign treasurer or assistant campaign treasurer of a political\n       committee who fails to report in whole or in part a campaign contribution or\n       campaign expenditure as required by this chapter is liable for damages as provided\n       by this section.\n\nId. § 254.231(a).\n       3\n         James Sylvester lost to Jack Stick, Ken Yarborough lost to Dwayne Bohac, and Josephine\nMiller lost to Gene Seaman.\n       4\n          The Election Code defines a political committee as “a group of persons that has as a\nprincipal purpose accepting political contributions or making political expenditures.” Id.\n§ 251.001(12).\n\n                                                 3\n\ftreasurer as required by chapter 253 of the Election Code and had failed to report in accordance\n\nwith chapter 254 of the Election Code. See id. §§ 253.004(a) (“A person may not knowingly make\n\nor authorize a political expenditure in violation of this chapter.”), 253.031(b) (requiring political\n\ncommittee to have campaign treasurer appointment in effect before accepting political contributions\n\nor making political expenditures totaling more than $500), 253.037(a) (prohibiting general-purpose\n\ncommittee from making political expenditures or contributions during 60-day period following the\n\nfiling of campaign treasurer appointment), 254.039 (requiring reporting for certain general-purpose\n\ncommittees), 254.153 (requiring semiannual reporting for general-purpose committees), 254.154\n\n(requiring additional reporting for general-purpose committees involved in election). Based on their\n\ncontention that TAB was a political committee, appellants also alleged that CIGNA and CT General\n\nviolated the Election Code by making illegal corporate political contributions. See id. § 253.094(a).5\n\n               In the alternative, appellants alleged that TAB as a corporation failed to report in\n\naccordance with former section 253.062 of the Election Code. See Act of June 18, 1997, 75th Leg.,\n\nR.S., ch. 864, § 244, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 2742, 2778, repealed by Act of June 17, 2011, 82d Leg.,\n\nR.S., ch. 1009, § 6(2), 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 2554, 2556.\n\n               Appellants’ claims concerning the alleged services of TAB employees to BACPAC\n\nwere based on TAB’s status as a corporation. Appellants contended that TAB, CIGNA, and CT\n\n\n       5\n         In 2002, section 253.094(a) limited corporate political contributions and expenditures to\nthose expressly allowed in the subchapter. See Act of June 19, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch. 899, § 1,\n1987 Tex. Gen. Laws 2995, 3009 (amended 2011). In 2011, section 253.094(a) was amended to read:\n\n       A corporation or labor organization may not make a political contribution that is not\n       authorized by this subchapter.\n\nTex. Elec. Code § 253.094(a).\n\n                                                  4\n\fGeneral made illegal corporate political contributions and that BACPAC illegally accepted corporate\n\npolitical contributions. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.003(b) (“A person may not knowingly accept\n\na political contribution the person knows to have been made in violation of this chapter.”), .094(a)\n\n(“A corporation or labor organization may not make a political contribution that is not authorized\n\nby this subchapter.”).\n\n               As to Hammond, appellants alleged that he “either made or had final approval over\n\nall material decisions” regarding TAB’s alleged political expenditures and contributions. Appellants\n\nalso alleged that appellees engaged in a conspiracy to violate the Election Code.6 Appellants sought\n\ndamages against all of the appellees under section 253.131 and against TAB under section 254.231.\n\nSee id. §§ 253.131, 254.231.\n\n\nSummary Judgment Motions\n\n               Appellees filed traditional motions for summary judgment. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\n\nCiting Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), CIGNA and CT General\n\nmoved for summary judgment based on their assertions that they gave money to TAB solely to fund\n\nthe mailers and that the mailers were independent of and not coordinated with any campaign or\n\nofficeholder and, therefore, protected by the Constitution as independent expenditures. They urged\n\nthat, after Citizens United, it was undisputed they, as well as TAB, could make these types of direct\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Appellants have not challenged the summary judgment ruling in favor of appellees as to\nthe conspiracy claim. Thus, appellants have waived any error with regard to that claim. See Jacobs\nv. Satterwhite, 65 S.W.3d 653, 655–56 (Tex. 2001) (per curiam) (concluding that court of appeals\nerred by reversing summary judgment on particular claim because appellant did not complain about\nsummary judgment on that claim).\n\n                                                 5\n\fexpenditures on their own and, therefore, that they could combine to do the same thing. They also\n\nasserted that they were not subject to chapter 254 of the Election Code, which addresses reporting\n\nrequirements, and that there was no civil conspiracy liability for committing lawful acts.\n\n               Evidence attached to their motion included copies of Hammond’s memorandum\n\ndated August 22, 2002, the ethics lawyer’s opinion letter that was attached to the memorandum,\n\ncopies of the mailers, an indictment of TAB concerning the mailers, an order quashing the indictment\n\nin June 2006, discovery responses by appellants, and a letter ruling in another civil case addressing\n\nsimilar claims by losing candidates against TAB and other corporations. In that case, the trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment for the corporate defendants who also had donated money to TAB for\n\nits “voter education” mailers in the 2002 general election cycle.\n\n               TAB, Hammond, and BACPAC moved for summary judgment on the ground that\n\nall of appellants’ claims for monetary damages were factually predicated on TAB’s use of corporate\n\nfunds in each of their particular legislative races. They then argued that the Election Code provisions\n\ndid not apply to TAB’s “public education program” and, therefore, that appellants’ claims failed as\n\na matter of law. They cited Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), to argue that chapter 253 of the\n\nElection Code did not apply because none of TAB’s mailers were express advocacy. The mailers\n\ndid not contain words such as “vote for” or “defeat.” See id. at 44 n.52 (setting forth examples of\n\n“express words of advocacy” such as “‘vote for, elect, support’”); see also Osterberg v. Peca,\n\n12 S.W.3d 31, 51 (Tex. 2000) (holding that “‘direct campaign expenditure’ by an individual in a\n\ncandidate election includes only those expenditures that ‘expressly advocate’ the election or defeat\n\nof an identified candidate”). TAB, Hammond, and BACPAC alternatively argued that, if chapter\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f253 of the Election Code did apply to the mailers, its application was unconstitutional, vague,\n\noverbroad, and violated their First Amendment rights.\n\n                Citing Citizens United, they also argued that, although the Texas Legislature could\n\nrequire disclosure of corporate expenditures, that it had yet to do so and that, even if the mailers were\n\nexpress advocacy, the legislature does not have the authority to prevent TAB from using corporate\n\nfunds to disseminate the mailers. They further argued that section 254.231 of the Election Code did\n\nnot apply to them, that TAB was not a political committee, and that, even if it was, there was no need\n\nto segregate contributions for “administrative expenses.” As to the alleged in-kind contributions by\n\nTAB to BACPAC, they contended that TAB’s employees’ services were unrelated to the mailers and\n\nthat appellants’ allegations did not include a violation of section 253.002 as a basis for their claims.\n\n                Appellees’ motions were supported by affidavits by Hammond. In one of his affidavits,\n\nhe testified in relevant part:\n\n\n        3.      During the 2002 state election cycle TAB received in excess of $1.8 million\n                from corporations. The entirety of this money was used to fund TAB’s voter\n                education mailers, as described below.\n\n        4.      TAB independently provided voters, via eighty-eight (88) direct mailers,\n                with information on candidates for the Texas House of Representatives and\n                the Texas Senate. These mailers provided by TAB highlighted a particular\n                candidate’s view on specific issues, such as lawsuit reform, healthcare\n                and taxes. These voter education pieces were informational only, and did not\n                encourage readers to vote for or against any candidate. Additionally, these\n                mail pieces did not use any words or phrases, such as “vote for,” “elect,”\n                “support,” “cast your ballot for,” “vote against,” “defeat” or “reject.” TAB\n                prepared these issue advertisements on their own volition, without consultation\n                or coordination or cooperation from any candidate or agent thereof.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fResponses to Summary Judgment Motions\n\n               Appellants filed responses to the motions with supporting evidence. They contended\n\nthat TAB was a corporation and a political committee under the Election Code. Appellants also\n\nargued that the mailers were express advocacy and, therefore, “campaign expenditures” subject to\n\nthe Election Code. See Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(7) (defining “campaign expenditure” as “an\n\nexpenditure made by any person in connection with a campaign for an elective office or measure”).\n\nThey further argued that TAB violated section 253.094(a) of the Election Code by making corporate\n\npolitical contributions to BACPAC and that BACPAC violated section 253.003(b) by accepting\n\ncorporate political contributions from TAB, which BACPAC then used in connection with\n\nappellants’ elections. See id. §§ 253.003(b), .094(a).\n\n               As to CT General and CIGNA, appellants contended, based on their position that\n\nTAB was a political committee, that CT General and Cigna Healthcare violated the Election Code\n\nby making contributions to TAB without restricting TAB’s use of their money to administrative\n\npurposes.    See id. §§ 253.094(a), 253.100 (limiting corporate political contributions to\n\ngeneral-purpose committee “to finance the establishment or administration” of the committee);\n\nEx Parte Ellis, 309 S.W.3d 71, 88 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (addressing corporate expenditures to\n\ngeneral-purpose committees under section 253.100). They also urged that the contributions by CT\n\nGeneral and CIGNA to TAB violated the Election Code because TAB made in-kind corporate\n\ncontributions to BACPAC, and BACPAC made political contributions to candidates in the 2002\n\ngeneral election cycle. Appellants, however, agreed that they did not have claims against CIGNA\n\nand CT General based on chapter 254.\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f               Appellants’ evidence included copies of the mailers, transcripts and exhibits from\n\ndepositions of Hammond, excerpts of a portion of the hearing in 2003 on TAB’s motion to quash,\n\nBACPAC’s campaign finance reports for the 2002 general election, and TAB’s 2005 indictment and\n\nplea agreement concerning the alleged TAB employees’ services provided to BACPAC. The plea\n\nagreement reflects that TAB entered a guilty plea on the misdemeanor offense of unlawful direct\n\ncampaign expenditures under section 253.002 of the Election Code, and the State and TAB agreed\n\nto enter into a deferred prosecution agreement as to a separate count. The campaign finance reports\n\nshowed that BACPAC made political contributions to appellants’ opponents. The excerpts from the\n\nhearing in 2003 were of the testimony from one of TAB’s employees. She testified that she, as well\n\nas Hammond and Jack Campbell,7 worked on political projects for BACPAC during the 2002\n\ngeneral election cycle.\n\n               After a hearing in 2011, the trial court granted appellees’ motions and signed a final\n\nsummary judgment in their favor. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n               Appellants bring six issues challenging the trial court’s summary judgment ruling.\n\nIn their first and third issues, they contend that TAB was a political committee under the Election\n\nCode and, therefore, that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on their claims that\n\nTAB unlawfully accepted campaign contributions, unlawfully made campaign expenditures, and\n\nfailed to file required reports with the TEC. In their second issue, appellants contend that, even if\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           Campbell was also a TAB employee.\n\n                                                 9\n\fTAB was not a political committee, that it made unlawful direct campaign expenditures by failing\n\nto report such expenditures to the TEC. In their fourth and fifth issues, appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by granting summary judgment as to their claims that were based on TAB’s alleged\n\nin-kind corporate political contributions to BACPAC. In their sixth issue, appellants contend that\n\nthe trial court erred by granting summary judgment regarding their claims that CT General and\n\nCIGNA made unlawful corporate political contributions to TAB.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n               We review a trial court’s summary judgment rulings de novo. Valence Operating\n\nCo. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). To prevail on a traditional motion for summary\n\njudgment, a defendant must conclusively negate at least one essential element of each of the\n\nplaintiff’s causes of action or must conclusively establish each element of an affirmative defense.\n\nTex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); Long Distance Int’l, Inc. v. Telefonos de Mexico, S.A. de C.V., 49 S.W.3d 347,\n\n350–51 (Tex. 2001); Science Spectrum, Inc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex. 1997).\n\n               When the trial court does not specify the grounds for its summary judgment, as is the\n\ncase here, the appellate court must affirm the summary judgment “if any of the theories presented\n\nto the trial court and preserved for appellate review are meritorious.” Provident Life & Accident Ins.\n\nCo. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 216 (Tex. 2003). When reviewing a summary judgment, we “review\n\nthe evidence presented by the motion and response in the light most favorable to the party against\n\nwhom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable to that party if reasonable\n\njurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not.” Mack Trucks,\n\nInc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex. 2006); see Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d at 661.\n\n                                                  10\n\f               Appellants’ issues also concern statutory construction. We review matters of statutory\n\nconstruction de novo. See Texas Mun. Power Agency v. Public Util. Comm’n, 253 S.W.3d 184,\n\n192 (Tex. 2007). Of primary concern in construing a statute is the express statutory language. See\n\nGalbraith Eng’g Consultants, Inc. v. Pochucha, 290 S.W.3d 863, 867 (Tex. 2009); Osterberg,\n\n12 S.W.3d at 38. “We thus construe the text according to its plain and common meaning unless a\n\ncontrary intention is apparent from the context or unless such a construction leads to absurd results.”\n\nPresidio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Scott, 309 S.W.3d 927, 930 (Tex. 2010) (citing City of Rockwall\n\nv. Hughes, 246 S.W.3d 621, 625–26 (Tex. 2008)). We consider the entire act, not isolated portions.\n\n20801, Inc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 396 (Tex. 2008). We also interpret statutes, if possible, in a\n\nway that makes them constitutional. See City of Pasadena v. Smith, 292 S.W.3d 14, 19 (Tex. 2009).\n\n\nTAB’s “Voter Education” Mailers\n\n               Appellants’ first and third issues challenge the trial court’s summary judgment regarding\n\nappellants’ claims that were based on TAB’s “voter education” mailers. Appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by granting summary judgment on these claims because TAB, by its actions, was\n\na political committee and, as such, unlawfully accepted political contributions and unlawfully made\n\ncampaign expenditures to fund the mailers without appointing a campaign treasurer or filing required\n\nreports. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.004(a), 253.031(b), 253.037(a), 254.039, 254.153, 254.154.\n\n               The Election Code defines a “political committee” to mean “a group of persons that\n\nhas as a principal purpose accepting political contributions or making political expenditures.” Id.\n\n§ 251.001(12). Appellants urge that the evidence raises a fact issue regarding whether TAB was a\n\npolitical committee because the summary judgment evidence was more than sufficient to show that\n\n                                                  11\n\fa “principal purpose” of TAB was to accept political contributions—evidenced by the payments\n\nfrom the corporations—and to make political expenditures, including spending funds on the mailers.\n\nSee id. § 251.001(5), (6), (7), (12) (defining “political contribution,” “expenditure,” “campaign\n\nexpenditure,” and “political committee”).8 They point to the undisputed evidence that TAB accepted\n\nmoney from corporations, including CT General and CIGNA, and spent in excess of $1.8 million\n\nto fund the mailers. It was also undisputed that TAB did not appoint a campaign treasurer or file\n\nreports with the TEC during the 2002 general election. If TAB was a political committee, it violated\n\nthe Election Code’s requirements to appoint a campaign treasurer and file reports with the TEC.\n\nSee id. §§ 253.004(a), 253.031(b), 253.037(a), 254.039, 254.153, 254.154.\n\n               The parties join issue as to whether the mailers were “express advocacy” and\n\n“campaign expenditures” subject to the Election Code to support their competing positions as to\n\nwhether TAB was a political committee. See id. § 251.001(7) (defining “campaign expenditure”);\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 324–25 (describing “functional equivalent” of express advocacy);\n\nOsterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 51 (holding that “‘direct campaign expenditure’ by an individual in a\n\ncandidate election includes only those expenditures that ‘expressly advocate’ the election or defeat\n\nof an identified candidate”). Guided by the plain language of the Election Code and the directive\n\nfrom the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United, however, we need not determine whether\n\nthe mailers were “express advocacy” or “campaign expenditures.”\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Election Code defines a political expenditure to include a campaign expenditure\nand, as previously stated, a campaign expenditure means “an expenditure made by any person in\nconnection with a campaign for elective office or on a measure.” Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(7), (10).\n\n                                                12\n\f               TAB, in its capacity as a corporation, was subject to subchapter D of chapter 253,\n\nwhich addresses restrictions and limitations that expressly apply to corporations and labor\n\norganizations. See Tex. Elec. Code. §§ 253.091–.104. In 2002, section 253.094 prohibited\n\ncorporations from making political expenditures unless expressly authorized in subchapter D.\n\nSee Act of June 19, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch. 899, § 1, 1987 Tex. Gen. Laws 2995, 3009 (amended\n\n2011). Political expenditures include campaign expenditures. Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(10).\n\nAssuming without deciding then that the mailers were “campaign expenditures,” TAB—as a\n\ncorporation—would have violated section 253.094 as it existed in 2002 because no other provision\n\nwithin subchapter D authorized corporations to make this type of political expenditure. See id.\n\n               The United States Supreme Court in Citizens United, however, made clear that\n\ncorporations have the same First Amendment free speech rights as individuals to make independent\n\npolitical expenditures. See 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365. In that case, Citizens United, a non-profit\n\ncorporation that was funded by donations from individuals and for-profit corporations, challenged\n\na federal statute that prohibited it from making independent political expenditures. Id. at 318–19.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted Citizens United relief, holding that the ban on corporate-funded\n\nindependent expenditures violated the First Amendment. Id. at 341–42, 356, 365. Similar to the\n\nexpenditures at issue in Citizens United, the mailers at issue here were independent from any\n\ncampaign or candidate. In his affidavit, Hammond testified that TAB prepared the mailers “on\n\ntheir own volition, without consultation or coordination from any candidate or agent thereof.”\n\nAppellants did not present contrary evidence. Thus, applying the analysis of Citizens United, even\n\nif the mailers were political expenditures and the “functional equivalent of express advocacy,” the\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fFirst Amendment does not permit prohibiting a corporation, such as TAB, from disseminating the\n\nmailers.9 See id. at 372 (concluding unconstitutional to restrict corporate independent expenditures);\n\nsee also Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(8) (defining “direct campaign expenditure”).\n\n                 Further, appellants have not cited, and we have not found, post-Citizens United\n\nauthority that would support appellants’ position that an incorporated trade association such as TAB,\n\nby seeking money from corporations to fund, and then funding, constitutionally protected,\n\nindependent expenditures, subjected itself to the 2002 regulatory scheme directed to political\n\ncommittees. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365; Texans for Free Enter. v. Texas\n\nEthics Comm’n, 732 F.3d 535, 538 (5th Cir. 2013) (noting “no difference in principle—at least where\n\nthe only asserted state interest is in preventing apparent or actual corruption—between banning an\n\norganization such as TFE from engaging in advocacy and banning it from seeking funds to engage\n\nin that advocacy (or in giving funds to other organizations to allow them to engage in advocacy on\n\nits behalf)”).\n\n                 We are also mindful that we interpret statutes, if possible, in a way that makes them\n\nconstitutional. See City of Pasadena, 292 S.W.3d at 19. Appellants do not contend that TAB was\n\na sham corporation or that it was formed solely for the purpose of “accepting political contributions\n\nor making political expenditures” but argue that its actions surrounding the mailers in 2002 create\n\na fact issue relating to “a principal purpose” in the definition of political committee. See Tex. Elec.\n\n\n\n\n        9\n         Appellants do not contend otherwise. They state in their brief: “Appellants do not contest\nthat corporations have the legal right to spend their own money to try and sway voters towards their\nown preferred slate of candidates.”\n\n                                                  14\n\fCode § 251.001(12).10 Were we to interpret “principal purpose” in the definition of “political\n\ncommittee” as suggested by appellants so that corporations making independent political\n\nexpenditures morph into political committees under the Election Code as it existed in 2002 when\n\nthey made the expenditures, the definition would be an affront to the First Amendment.11 See\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365.\n\n               Further, appellants’ suggested definition of “political committee” is inconsistent with\n\nthe framework of the Election Code’s overall scheme. See Parker, 249 S.W.3d at 396 (considering\n\nentire act and not isolated portions when interpreting statutes). The Election Code’s overall scheme\n\ntreats corporations and political committees as distinct types of entities and subjects them to\n\nincompatible provisions. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.031–.043 (provisions directed to political\n\ncommittees, officeholders, and candidates); §§ 253.091–.104 (provisions directed to corporations\n\nand labor organizations). Considering the context of the Election Code’s overall scheme and the\n\nSupreme Court’s directive, we decline to interpret the definition so broadly. See Citizens United,\n\n558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365; City of Pasadena, 292 S.W.3d at 19; see also Tex. Elec. Code\n\n§ 251.001(12); Parker, 249 S.W.3d at 396; King St. Patriots v. Texas Democratic Party,\n\n\n\n       10\n           As previously stated, the definition of a political committee requires that the group have\nas “a principal purpose accepting political contributions or making political expenditures.” Tex. Elec.\nCode § 251.001(12). Applying their common meaning, “purpose” means “[t]he object toward which\none strives or for which something exists; goal; aim.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1062 (1973). “Principal” means “[f]irst, highest, or foremost in importance, rank, worth,\nor degree; chief.” Id. at 1041.\n       11\n          The dissent misstates the bases of our holding. The dissent argues that a group of persons\ncould have more than one principal purpose but, even if that were the case, that is not a controlling\nissue here. The controlling issue is the impact and reach of the holding of Citizens United on the\nElection Code provisions at issue, including the scope of the political committee definition in the\ncontext of a corporation’s constitutional right to make independent political expenditures.\n\n                                                  15\n\f__ S.W.3d __, No. 03-12-00255-CV, 2014 Tex.

(in context of First Amendment challenge to definition of “political\n\ncommittee,” applying common meaning of “principal” and “purpose” and “[v]iewing definitions as\n\na whole and in context with each other”).\n\n               Appellants cite a TEC ethics advisory opinion to support their position that TAB is\n\nsubject to the provisions for both corporations and political committees under the Election Code.\n\nSee Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 242 (1995); see also Tex. Elec. Code § 253.092 (addressing\n\ntreatment of incorporated political committee). In the opinion, the TEC concluded that a political\n\ncommittee could incorporate solely for liability purposes without subjecting itself to the limitations\n\nthat the Election Code places on corporations. See Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 242. Section\n\n253.092 of the Election Code similarly states that a political committee that “incorporates for\n\nliability purposes only” is not considered to be a corporation for purposes of subchapter D.12\n\nSee Tex. Elec. Code § 253.092. The opinion and section 253.092 make sense in the scheme of\n\nchapter 253. Otherwise, an incorporated political committee would be foreclosed from provisions\n\nin subchapter B, such as the allowance of campaign contributions, that conflict with restrictions in\n\nsubchapter D, such as the prohibition from making political contributions. See id. §§ 251.001(12),\n\n253.031(c) (allowing campaign contributions), 253.094(a) (prohibiting contributions); see also\n\nColumbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue, 271 S.W.3d 238, 256 (Tex. 2008) (“The Court\n\nmust not interpret the statute in a manner that renders any part of the statute meaningless or\n\n\n\n       12\n           The dissent also states that our holding is based on the conclusion that a corporation can\nnever be a political committee, but, as we acknowledge, section 253.092 of the Election Code allows\na political committee to incorporate. Again, that is not a controlling issue here.\n\n                                                 16\n\fsuperfluous.”). But, in the context of independent expenditures, it does not follow that the\n\ninapplicability of section 253.092 to a corporation supports subjecting the corporation to Election\n\nCode provisions applicable to political committees.13\n\n               Appellants did not present evidence that contradicted TAB’s evidence that its\n\nprincipal purpose was to be an incorporated trade association for the business community. In one\n\nof his affidavits, Hammond testified that TAB “promotes the free enterprise system by working to\n\nimprove the Texas business climate and to help make our state’s economy the strongest in the world”\n\nand that it “lobbies on every issue that impacts business to ensure that employers’ opinions are being\n\nheard.” The summary judgment evidence also included copies of TAB’s budgets for 2001 and 2002\n\nand business reports to its members. The budgets and reports conform with Hammond’s testimony\n\nregarding TAB’s principal purpose as a trade association. One of the reports states that TAB’s\n\nmission is “to build the best business climate on the planet through legislative action on the state and\n\nfederal levels.”\n\n               Here, the evidence was conclusive that TAB did not incorporate solely for liability\n\npurposes, that its principal purpose was to be a trade association for the business community, and\n\nthat its actions surrounding the mailers were independent from campaigns and candidates. Given\n\n\n       13\n           After all, even if a corporation complied with the regulations applicable to political\ncommittees, it still would have violated the Election Code as it existed in 2002 if it made\nindependent political expenditures. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.031(c) (allowing political\ncommittees to make campaign contributions and expenditures after appointment of campaign\ntreasurer), former 253.094(a) (prohibiting corporation from making political contributions\nand expenditures unless authorized by subchapter); see also id. § 251.001(3) (defining\n“campaign contribution”), (5) (defining “political contribution”); Presidio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Scott,\n309 S.W.3d 927, 931 (Tex. 2010) (“Courts must not give the words used by the Legislature an\n‘exaggerated, forced, or constrained meaning.’” (quoting City of Austin v. Southwestern Bell Tel.\nCo., 92 S.W.3d 434, 442 (Tex. 2002))).\n\n                                                  17\n\fthis uncontested evidence, we conclude that TAB established as a matter of law that its actions\n\nsurrounding the mailers did not subject it to the Election Code provisions directed to\n\npolitical committees. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). On this basis, we overrule appellants’ first and\n\nthird issues.\n\n\nFormer Section 253.062\n\n                In their second issue, appellants contend in the alternative that TAB violated former\n\nsection 253.062 of the Election Code by making direct campaign expenditures without reporting\n\nsuch expenditures. See Act of June 18, 1997, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws at 2778. In 2002, section\n\n253.062 prohibited an “individual” from making direct campaign expenditures exceeding $100\n\nunless the individual complied with chapter 254 as if the individual were a campaign treasurer of a\n\npolitical committee. See id.14\n\n                Appellants cite a TEC 2010 advisory opinion to support their position that TAB in\n\n2002 was subject to former section 253.062. See Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 489 (2010). In that\n\nopinion, TEC concluded that corporations that make direct campaign expenditures were required to\n\ncomply with section 253.062. Appellants contend that we should defer to TEC’s interpretation of\n\nthe statute. “A reasonable construction of a statute by the administrative agency charged with its\n\nenforcement is entitled to great weight.” Osterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 51 (citing State v. Public Util.\n\nComm’n, 883 S.W.2d 190, 196 (Tex. 1994); Dodd v. Meno, 870 S.W.2d 4, 7 (Tex. 1994)). We may\n\nnot defer to an agency’s interpretation of a statute, however, that is inconsistent with the language\n\n\n        14\n              In 2011, the legislature enacted section 254.261. See Act of May 24, 2011,\n82d Leg., R.S., ch. 1009, § 5, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 1009. Section 254.261 requires a “person” to\nfile reports for direct campaign expenditures exceeding $100. See Tex. Elec. Code § 254.261. Thus,\na corporation’s direct campaign expenditures are now subject to disclosure. See id.\n\n                                                 18\n\fof the statute. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co. v. Combs, 340 S.W.3d 432, 438 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(noting that courts normally defer to agency’s interpretation of statute that is vague or ambiguous\n\nunless “plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language of the statute”).\n\n                The text of former section 253.062 is not vague or ambiguous. The statute expressly\n\nstates that it applies to an “individual not acting in concert with another person.” Had the legislature\n\nintended a different or broader classification, it could have said so. See Texas Lottery Comm’n v. First\n\nState Bank of DeQueen, 325 S.W.3d 628, 636 (Tex. 2010). In its 2010 opinion, the TEC recognized\n\nas much. See Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 489. It noted that Citizens United created a gap in the\n\ndisclosure requirements for corporations, labor organizations, and other persons:\n\n\n        Title 15 does not explicitly state that a corporation, labor organization, or certain other\n        persons[ ] must file reports to disclose direct campaign expenditures made to support\n        or oppose a candidate. . . . Thus, title 15 did not specifically require disclosure of\n        such expenditures because it simultaneously prohibited them. Citizens United\n        removed our ability to restrict direct campaign expenditures by corporations, labor\n        organizations, and other persons. This result has created a gap or ambiguity in title\n        15 that prompts us to address whether the absence of statutory language specifically\n        addressing these direct campaign expenditures made to support or oppose candidates\n        reflects the legislature’s intent that title 15, in the circumstances following Citizens\n        United, require such expenditures to be disclosed.\n\n\nId. As the TEC recognized in its 2010 opinion, pre-Citizens United, the Election Code limited the\n\ntypes of political expenditures corporations could make. It follows that the legislature could not have\n\nintended for a corporation to disclose prohibited expenditures given that a corporation was not\n\nallowed to make them in the first place. There was no need to have a disclosure requirement for\n\ncorporations because there was nothing to disclose.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f               Given the plain language of former section 253.062, we decline to expand the\n\nmeaning of “individual” to subject a corporation to liability for failing to report direct campaign\n\nexpenditures in 2002. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co., 340 S.W.3d at 439 (“We presume that\n\nthe Legislature chooses a statute’s language with care, including each word chosen for a purpose,\n\nwhile purposefully omitting words not chosen.”); Scott, 309 S.W.3d at 930–31. On this basis, we\n\noverrule appellants’ second issue.\n\n\nTAB Employees’ Services to BACPAC\n\n               Appellants’ fourth and fifth issues challenge the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nrulings in favor of TAB and BACPAC as to appellants’ claims regarding the alleged employees’\n\nservices provided by TAB to BACPAC. In their fourth issue, appellants contend that TAB as a\n\ncorporation violated section 253.094(a) because its employees’ services were in-kind political\n\ncontributions and TAB did not present evidence that it restricted the contributions to administrative\n\nmatters. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.094(a) (prohibiting corporations from making political\n\ncontributions), 253.100; Ex parte Ellis, 309 S.W.3d at 88 (discussing section 253.100); see also Tex.\n\nElec. Code § 251.001(2), (3), (5) (defining “contributions,” “political contributions” and “campaign\n\ncontributions”). In their fifth issue, based on the same alleged employees’ services, appellants\n\ncontend that BACPAC violated section 253.003(b) by accepting the in-kind political contributions\n\nfrom TAB. See Tex. Elec. Code § 253.003(b) (“A person may not knowingly accept a political\n\ncontribution the person knows to have been made in violation of this chapter.”).\n\n               In their summary judgment motions, TAB and BACPAC challenged these claims on\n\nthe ground that the mailers were “not factually connected with the criminal charges to which TAB\n\n                                                 20\n\fplead guilty” and appellants did not allege a section 253.002 violation. The evidence was undisputed\n\nthat TAB pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense of unlawful direct campaign expenditures under\n\nsection 253.002 of the Election Code concerning TAB employees’ services to BACPAC, and not\n\nto making unlawful in-kind corporate political contributions. See id. § 253.002 (prohibiting person\n\nfrom knowingly making or authorizing direct campaign expenditures with exceptions); see also id.\n\n§ 251.001(2), (3), (5). Further, appellants in their pleadings did not assert a violation of section\n\n253.002 to support their request for statutory damages as to the alleged in-kind employees’\n\nservices, but a violation of section 253.094(a) by TAC and section 253.003(b) by BACPAC. See id.\n\n§§ 253.003(b) (prohibiting knowingly accepting political contributions made in violation of chapter),\n\n.094 (prohibiting corporations from making political contributions not authorized by subchapter D).15\n\nOn this basis, we overrule appellants’ fourth and fifth issues.\n\n\nContributions from CIGNA and CT General to TAB\n\n               In their sixth issue, appellants contend that CT General and CIGNA were not entitled\n\nto summary judgment on appellants’ claims that they made unlawful corporate political contributions\n\nto TAB. Appellants make similar arguments to those made in their first and third issues, arguments\n\nbased on their position that TAB was a political committee. They contend that CIGNA and CT\n\nGeneral violated the Election Code by making contributions to a political committee—TAB—and\n\n\n       15\n          In the section of their Tenth Amended Original Petition titled “Causes of Action,” appellants\nasserted that TAB violated sections 253.004(a), 253.031(b), and 253.037(a) by making political\nexpenditures without a campaign treasurer appointment. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.004(a),\n.031(b), .037(a). As to the alleged “corporate political contributions to BACPAC,” appellants\nspecifically asserted that TAB violated section 253.094(a) and BACPAC violated section\n253.003(b). See id. §§ 253.003(b), .094(a).\n\n                                                  21\n\fthen failing to restrict their contributions to administrative purposes. See id. §§ 253.094(a), 253.100;\n\nEx parte Ellis, 309 S.W.3d at 88.\n\n                Given our conclusion that the summary judgment evidence established as a matter\n\nof law that TAB’s conduct surrounding the mailers did not subject it to the restrictions applicable\n\nto political committees, it follows that CT General and CIGNA did not violate the Election Code by\n\ndonating money to TAB to fund the mailers and that such payments—because they were not made\n\nto a candidate or political committee—did not fall within the definition of contribution under the\n\nElection Code. See Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(3), (5) (“political contribution” includes a “campaign\n\ncontribution” which means a “contribution to a candidate or a political committee . . .”). Appellants\n\ndo not dispute that CT General and CIGNA could have funded and sent the mailers themselves as\n\nindependent political expenditures. Appellants also have failed to cite, and we have not found, post-\n\nCitizens United authority that would support prohibiting corporations from funding the types of\n\nmailers at issue here. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365; Texans for Free Enter.,\n\n732 F.3d at 538. Further, because we have concluded as a matter of law that the mailers did not\n\nsubject TAB to the provisions of the Election Code applicable to political committees, we need not\n\nreach appellants’ argument that CT General and CIGNA violated the Election Code by making\n\ncontributions to a political committee without restricting the contributions to administrative purposes.\n\nSee Tex. Elec. Code § 253.100.\n\n                To the extent that appellants’ claims against CT General and CIGNA are based on\n\nthe alleged employees’ services from TAB to BACPAC, those claims fail as well. The summary\n\njudgment evidence was conclusive that CT General and CIGNA paid money to TAB to fund the\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fmailers and that TAB used the corporate money exclusively for the mailers. In one of his affidavits,\n\nHammond testified, “During the 2002 state election cycle TAB received in excess of $1.8 million\n\nfrom corporations. The entirety of this money was used to fund TAB’s voter education mailers, as\n\ndescribed below.” Appellants point to another affidavit by Hammond in which he testified that the\n\nmailers were funded through TAB’s general account, “which contains money received from\n\ndues, assessments, and other revenue-producing activities.” But the fact that the mailers were paid\n\nthrough the general account is not inconsistent with and does not refute Hammond’s testimony that\n\nthe corporate money was used solely to fund the mailers.\n\n               We conclude that CT General and CIGNA established as a matter of law that they did\n\nnot make unlawful corporate contributions to TAB and that the trial court, therefore, did not err by\n\ngranting summary judgment in their favor. We overrule appellants’ sixth issue.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n\n                                              Melissa Goodwin, Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Jones, Justices Rose and Goodwin\n  Dissenting opinion by Chief Justice Jones\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: December 19, 2014\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\f",

D-1-GN-02-004226, HONORABLE GISELA D. TRIANA, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                                         OPINION\n\n\n               Appellants James Sylvester, Ken Yarborough, and Josephine Miller, candidates for\n\nthe Texas House of Representatives in the 2002 general election, brought suit against appellees\n\nTexas Association of Business (TAB), Bill Hammond, the Texas Business and Commerce Political\n\nAction Committee (BACPAC), CIGNA Healthcare of Texas, Inc., and Connecticut General Life\n\nInsurance Company, alleging Election Code violations. Appellants sought damages based on “voter\n\neducation” mailers that TAB disseminated and alleged in-kind political contributions from TAB to\n\nBACPAC during the 2002 general election cycle. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.131, 254.231. The\n\ntrial court granted final summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, appellants raise six\n\nissues challenging the judgment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.1\n\n\n       1\n          We grant appellants’ motion for leave to file supplemental brief and appellees CIGNA\nHealthcare of Texas, Inc. and Connecticut General Life Insurance Company’s motion for leave to\nfile supplemental authority.\n\f                                         BACKGROUND\n\n               TAB is a non-profit corporation whose stated mission is “to build the best business\n\nclimate on the planet through legislative action on the state and federal levels.” TAB “lobbies on\n\nevery issue that impacts business to ensure that employers’ opinions are being heard.” Bill Hammond\n\nis TAB’s president and chief executive officer.\n\n               A few months before the 2002 general election, TAB solicited money from\n\ncorporations to fund a “voter education project.”          Hammond sent a memorandum dated\n\nAugust 22, 2002, to “Texas Business Leaders.” He stated that the goal was to raise one-million\n\ndollars and that “[o]ur strategy [was] simple: to educate voters about pro-business candidates through\n\nan aggressive direct mail program.” He also informed the corporations that “[c]ontributions for this\n\npurpose [were] not reportable” and provided an opinion letter from a Texas ethics attorney\n\n“regarding the legality of corporate expenditures for voter education programs.” In his letter, the\n\nattorney stated that corporate expenditures for “issue ads” were not reportable to the Texas Ethics\n\nCommission (TEC) or “any other governmental body.” In response, corporations, including CIGNA\n\nand CT General, contributed money to TAB in excess of $1.8 million for the “voter education\n\nproject.” TAB spent these funds to disseminate mailers that specifically addressed candidates for the\n\nTexas House of Representatives and the Texas Senate.\n\n               TAB also sponsors BACPAC, a voluntary, non-profit unincorporated political\n\ncommittee. TAB did not appoint a campaign treasurer or file reports with the TEC during the 2002\n\nelection cycle, but BACPAC did. BACPAC accepted and made campaign contributions in the 2002\n\ngeneral election, disclosing the contributions in reports filed with the TEC.\n\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fLitigation Commenced\n\n               Appellants brought this suit in 2002 seeking damages under the Election Code based\n\non the “voter education” mailers and alleged services provided by TAB employees to BACPAC.\n\nSee Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.131, 254.231.2 Appellants were unsuccessful candidates for the Texas\n\nHouse of Representatives in the 2002 general election.3 Some of the mailers provided information\n\nconcerning the positions of appellants, their opponents, or both on specific issues.\n\n               Appellants contended that TAB violated provisions of the Election Code that apply\n\nto corporations and provisions that apply to political committees. Appellants alleged that “TAB\n\nconstituted a political committee under the election code” by collecting funds and then spending\n\nthem in support or in opposition to various legislative candidates. See id. § 251.001(12) (defining\n\n“political committee”).4 Appellants urged that, as a political committee, TAB accepted illegal\n\npolitical contributions and made illegal political expenditures because it did not have a campaign\n\n\n       2\n           Section 253.131(a) of the Election Code reads: “A person who knowingly makes or\naccepts a campaign contribution or makes a campaign expenditure in violation of this chapter is\nliable for damages as provided in this section.” Tex. Elec. Code § 253.131(a). Section 254.231(a)\nof the Election Code similarly states:\n\n       A candidate or campaign treasurer or assistant campaign treasurer of a political\n       committee who fails to report in whole or in part a campaign contribution or\n       campaign expenditure as required by this chapter is liable for damages as provided\n       by this section.\n\nId. § 254.231(a).\n       3\n         James Sylvester lost to Jack Stick, Ken Yarborough lost to Dwayne Bohac, and Josephine\nMiller lost to Gene Seaman.\n       4\n          The Election Code defines a political committee as “a group of persons that has as a\nprincipal purpose accepting political contributions or making political expenditures.” Id.\n§ 251.001(12).\n\n                                                 3\n\ftreasurer as required by chapter 253 of the Election Code and had failed to report in accordance\n\nwith chapter 254 of the Election Code. See id. §§ 253.004(a) (“A person may not knowingly make\n\nor authorize a political expenditure in violation of this chapter.”), 253.031(b) (requiring political\n\ncommittee to have campaign treasurer appointment in effect before accepting political contributions\n\nor making political expenditures totaling more than $500), 253.037(a) (prohibiting general-purpose\n\ncommittee from making political expenditures or contributions during 60-day period following the\n\nfiling of campaign treasurer appointment), 254.039 (requiring reporting for certain general-purpose\n\ncommittees), 254.153 (requiring semiannual reporting for general-purpose committees), 254.154\n\n(requiring additional reporting for general-purpose committees involved in election). Based on their\n\ncontention that TAB was a political committee, appellants also alleged that CIGNA and CT General\n\nviolated the Election Code by making illegal corporate political contributions. See id. § 253.094(a).5\n\n               In the alternative, appellants alleged that TAB as a corporation failed to report in\n\naccordance with former section 253.062 of the Election Code. See Act of June 18, 1997, 75th Leg.,\n\nR.S., ch. 864, § 244, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws 2742, 2778, repealed by Act of June 17, 2011, 82d Leg.,\n\nR.S., ch. 1009, § 6(2), 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 2554, 2556.\n\n               Appellants’ claims concerning the alleged services of TAB employees to BACPAC\n\nwere based on TAB’s status as a corporation. Appellants contended that TAB, CIGNA, and CT\n\n\n       5\n         In 2002, section 253.094(a) limited corporate political contributions and expenditures to\nthose expressly allowed in the subchapter. See Act of June 19, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch. 899, § 1,\n1987 Tex. Gen. Laws 2995, 3009 (amended 2011). In 2011, section 253.094(a) was amended to read:\n\n       A corporation or labor organization may not make a political contribution that is not\n       authorized by this subchapter.\n\nTex. Elec. Code § 253.094(a).\n\n                                                  4\n\fGeneral made illegal corporate political contributions and that BACPAC illegally accepted corporate\n\npolitical contributions. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.003(b) (“A person may not knowingly accept\n\na political contribution the person knows to have been made in violation of this chapter.”), .094(a)\n\n(“A corporation or labor organization may not make a political contribution that is not authorized\n\nby this subchapter.”).\n\n               As to Hammond, appellants alleged that he “either made or had final approval over\n\nall material decisions” regarding TAB’s alleged political expenditures and contributions. Appellants\n\nalso alleged that appellees engaged in a conspiracy to violate the Election Code.6 Appellants sought\n\ndamages against all of the appellees under section 253.131 and against TAB under section 254.231.\n\nSee id. §§ 253.131, 254.231.\n\n\nSummary Judgment Motions\n\n               Appellees filed traditional motions for summary judgment. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\n\nCiting Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010), CIGNA and CT General\n\nmoved for summary judgment based on their assertions that they gave money to TAB solely to fund\n\nthe mailers and that the mailers were independent of and not coordinated with any campaign or\n\nofficeholder and, therefore, protected by the Constitution as independent expenditures. They urged\n\nthat, after Citizens United, it was undisputed they, as well as TAB, could make these types of direct\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          Appellants have not challenged the summary judgment ruling in favor of appellees as to\nthe conspiracy claim. Thus, appellants have waived any error with regard to that claim. See Jacobs\nv. Satterwhite, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393760\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393760/jacobs-v-satterwhite/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 655–56 (Tex. 2001) (per curiam) (concluding that court of appeals\nerred by reversing summary judgment on particular claim because appellant did not complain about\nsummary judgment on that claim).\n\n                                                 5\n\fexpenditures on their own and, therefore, that they could combine to do the same thing. They also\n\nasserted that they were not subject to chapter 254 of the Election Code, which addresses reporting\n\nrequirements, and that there was no civil conspiracy liability for committing lawful acts.\n\n               Evidence attached to their motion included copies of Hammond’s memorandum\n\ndated August 22, 2002, the ethics lawyer’s opinion letter that was attached to the memorandum,\n\ncopies of the mailers, an indictment of TAB concerning the mailers, an order quashing the indictment\n\nin June 2006, discovery responses by appellants, and a letter ruling in another civil case addressing\n\nsimilar claims by losing candidates against TAB and other corporations. In that case, the trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment for the corporate defendants who also had donated money to TAB for\n\nits “voter education” mailers in the 2002 general election cycle.\n\n               TAB, Hammond, and BACPAC moved for summary judgment on the ground that\n\nall of appellants’ claims for monetary damages were factually predicated on TAB’s use of corporate\n\nfunds in each of their particular legislative races. They then argued that the Election Code provisions\n\ndid not apply to TAB’s “public education program” and, therefore, that appellants’ claims failed as\n\na matter of law. They cited Buckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), to argue that chapter 253 of the\n\nElection Code did not apply because none of TAB’s mailers were express advocacy. The mailers\n\ndid not contain words such as “vote for” or “defeat.” See id. at 44 n.52 (setting forth examples of\n\n“express words of advocacy” such as “‘vote for, elect, support’”); see also Osterberg v. Peca,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1580987\"><a href=\"/opinion/1580987/osterberg-v-peca/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (Tex. 2000) (holding that “‘direct campaign expenditure’ by an individual in a\n\ncandidate election includes only those expenditures that ‘expressly advocate’ the election or defeat\n\nof an identified candidate”). TAB, Hammond, and BACPAC alternatively argued that, if chapter\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f253 of the Election Code did apply to the mailers, its application was unconstitutional, vague,\n\noverbroad, and violated their First Amendment rights.\n\n                Citing Citizens United, they also argued that, although the Texas Legislature could\n\nrequire disclosure of corporate expenditures, that it had yet to do so and that, even if the mailers were\n\nexpress advocacy, the legislature does not have the authority to prevent TAB from using corporate\n\nfunds to disseminate the mailers. They further argued that section 254.231 of the Election Code did\n\nnot apply to them, that TAB was not a political committee, and that, even if it was, there was no need\n\nto segregate contributions for “administrative expenses.” As to the alleged in-kind contributions by\n\nTAB to BACPAC, they contended that TAB’s employees’ services were unrelated to the mailers and\n\nthat appellants’ allegations did not include a violation of section 253.002 as a basis for their claims.\n\n                Appellees’ motions were supported by affidavits by Hammond. In one of his affidavits,\n\nhe testified in relevant part:\n\n\n        3.      During the 2002 state election cycle TAB received in excess of $1.8 million\n                from corporations. The entirety of this money was used to fund TAB’s voter\n                education mailers, as described below.\n\n        4.      TAB independently provided voters, via eighty-eight (88) direct mailers,\n                with information on candidates for the Texas House of Representatives and\n                the Texas Senate. These mailers provided by TAB highlighted a particular\n                candidate’s view on specific issues, such as lawsuit reform, healthcare\n                and taxes. These voter education pieces were informational only, and did not\n                encourage readers to vote for or against any candidate. Additionally, these\n                mail pieces did not use any words or phrases, such as “vote for,” “elect,”\n                “support,” “cast your ballot for,” “vote against,” “defeat” or “reject.” TAB\n                prepared these issue advertisements on their own volition, without consultation\n                or coordination or cooperation from any candidate or agent thereof.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   7\n\fResponses to Summary Judgment Motions\n\n               Appellants filed responses to the motions with supporting evidence. They contended\n\nthat TAB was a corporation and a political committee under the Election Code. Appellants also\n\nargued that the mailers were express advocacy and, therefore, “campaign expenditures” subject to\n\nthe Election Code. See Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(7) (defining “campaign expenditure” as “an\n\nexpenditure made by any person in connection with a campaign for an elective office or measure”).\n\nThey further argued that TAB violated section 253.094(a) of the Election Code by making corporate\n\npolitical contributions to BACPAC and that BACPAC violated section 253.003(b) by accepting\n\ncorporate political contributions from TAB, which BACPAC then used in connection with\n\nappellants’ elections. See id. §§ 253.003(b), .094(a).\n\n               As to CT General and CIGNA, appellants contended, based on their position that\n\nTAB was a political committee, that CT General and Cigna Healthcare violated the Election Code\n\nby making contributions to TAB without restricting TAB’s use of their money to administrative\n\npurposes.    See id. §§ 253.094(a), 253.100 (limiting corporate political contributions to\n\ngeneral-purpose committee “to finance the establishment or administration” of the committee);\n\nEx Parte Ellis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102911\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102911/ex-parte-ellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">309</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 88 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010) (addressing corporate expenditures to\n\ngeneral-purpose committees under section 253.100). They also urged that the contributions by CT\n\nGeneral and CIGNA to TAB violated the Election Code because TAB made in-kind corporate\n\ncontributions to BACPAC, and BACPAC made political contributions to candidates in the 2002\n\ngeneral election cycle. Appellants, however, agreed that they did not have claims against CIGNA\n\nand CT General based on chapter 254.\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f               Appellants’ evidence included copies of the mailers, transcripts and exhibits from\n\ndepositions of Hammond, excerpts of a portion of the hearing in 2003 on TAB’s motion to quash,\n\nBACPAC’s campaign finance reports for the 2002 general election, and TAB’s 2005 indictment and\n\nplea agreement concerning the alleged TAB employees’ services provided to BACPAC. The plea\n\nagreement reflects that TAB entered a guilty plea on the misdemeanor offense of unlawful direct\n\ncampaign expenditures under section 253.002 of the Election Code, and the State and TAB agreed\n\nto enter into a deferred prosecution agreement as to a separate count. The campaign finance reports\n\nshowed that BACPAC made political contributions to appellants’ opponents. The excerpts from the\n\nhearing in 2003 were of the testimony from one of TAB’s employees. She testified that she, as well\n\nas Hammond and Jack Campbell,7 worked on political projects for BACPAC during the 2002\n\ngeneral election cycle.\n\n               After a hearing in 2011, the trial court granted appellees’ motions and signed a final\n\nsummary judgment in their favor. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n               Appellants bring six issues challenging the trial court’s summary judgment ruling.\n\nIn their first and third issues, they contend that TAB was a political committee under the Election\n\nCode and, therefore, that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment on their claims that\n\nTAB unlawfully accepted campaign contributions, unlawfully made campaign expenditures, and\n\nfailed to file required reports with the TEC. In their second issue, appellants contend that, even if\n\n\n\n\n       7\n           Campbell was also a TAB employee.\n\n                                                 9\n\fTAB was not a political committee, that it made unlawful direct campaign expenditures by failing\n\nto report such expenditures to the TEC. In their fourth and fifth issues, appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by granting summary judgment as to their claims that were based on TAB’s alleged\n\nin-kind corporate political contributions to BACPAC. In their sixth issue, appellants contend that\n\nthe trial court erred by granting summary judgment regarding their claims that CT General and\n\nCIGNA made unlawful corporate political contributions to TAB.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n               We review a trial court’s summary judgment rulings de novo.

Appellants contend that the\n\ntrial court erred by granting summary judgment on these claims because TAB, by its actions, was\n\na political committee and, as such, unlawfully accepted political contributions and unlawfully made\n\ncampaign expenditures to fund the mailers without appointing a campaign treasurer or filing required\n\nreports. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.004(a), 253.031(b), 253.037(a), 254.039, 254.153, 254.154.\n\n               The Election Code defines a “political committee” to mean “a group of persons that\n\nhas as a principal purpose accepting political contributions or making political expenditures.” Id.\n\n§ 251.001(12). Appellants urge that the evidence raises a fact issue regarding whether TAB was a\n\npolitical committee because the summary judgment evidence was more than sufficient to show that\n\n                                                  11\n\fa “principal purpose” of TAB was to accept political contributions—evidenced by the payments\n\nfrom the corporations—and to make political expenditures, including spending funds on the mailers.\n\nSee id. § 251.001(5), (6), (7), (12) (defining “political contribution,” “expenditure,” “campaign\n\nexpenditure,” and “political committee”).8 They point to the undisputed evidence that TAB accepted\n\nmoney from corporations, including CT General and CIGNA, and spent in excess of $1.8 million\n\nto fund the mailers. It was also undisputed that TAB did not appoint a campaign treasurer or file\n\nreports with the TEC during the 2002 general election. If TAB was a political committee, it violated\n\nthe Election Code’s requirements to appoint a campaign treasurer and file reports with the TEC.\n\nSee id. §§ 253.004(a), 253.031(b), 253.037(a), 254.039, 254.153, 254.154.\n\n               The parties join issue as to whether the mailers were “express advocacy” and\n\n“campaign expenditures” subject to the Election Code to support their competing positions as to\n\nwhether TAB was a political committee. See id. § 251.001(7) (defining “campaign expenditure”);\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 324–25 (describing “functional equivalent” of express advocacy);\n\nOsterberg, 12 S.W.3d at 51 (holding that “‘direct campaign expenditure’ by an individual in a\n\ncandidate election includes only those expenditures that ‘expressly advocate’ the election or defeat\n\nof an identified candidate”). Guided by the plain language of the Election Code and the directive\n\nfrom the United States Supreme Court in Citizens United, however, we need not determine whether\n\nthe mailers were “express advocacy” or “campaign expenditures.”\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Election Code defines a political expenditure to include a campaign expenditure\nand, as previously stated, a campaign expenditure means “an expenditure made by any person in\nconnection with a campaign for elective office or on a measure.” Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(7), (10).\n\n                                                12\n\f               TAB, in its capacity as a corporation, was subject to subchapter D of chapter 253,\n\nwhich addresses restrictions and limitations that expressly apply to corporations and labor\n\norganizations. See Tex. Elec. Code. §§ 253.091–.104. In 2002, section 253.094 prohibited\n\ncorporations from making political expenditures unless expressly authorized in subchapter D.\n\nSee Act of June 19, 1987, 70th Leg., R.S., ch. 899, § 1, 1987 Tex. Gen. Laws 2995, 3009 (amended\n\n2011). Political expenditures include campaign expenditures. Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(10).\n\nAssuming without deciding then that the mailers were “campaign expenditures,” TAB—as a\n\ncorporation—would have violated section 253.094 as it existed in 2002 because no other provision\n\nwithin subchapter D authorized corporations to make this type of political expenditure. See id.\n\n               The United States Supreme Court in Citizens United, however, made clear that\n\ncorporations have the same First Amendment free speech rights as individuals to make independent\n\npolitical expenditures. See 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365. In that case, Citizens United, a non-profit\n\ncorporation that was funded by donations from individuals and for-profit corporations, challenged\n\na federal statute that prohibited it from making independent political expenditures. Id. at 318–19.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted Citizens United relief, holding that the ban on corporate-funded\n\nindependent expenditures violated the First Amendment. Id. at 341–42, 356, 365. Similar to the\n\nexpenditures at issue in Citizens United, the mailers at issue here were independent from any\n\ncampaign or candidate. In his affidavit, Hammond testified that TAB prepared the mailers “on\n\ntheir own volition, without consultation or coordination from any candidate or agent thereof.”\n\nAppellants did not present contrary evidence. Thus, applying the analysis of Citizens United, even\n\nif the mailers were political expenditures and the “functional equivalent of express advocacy,” the\n\n\n                                                 13\n\fFirst Amendment does not permit prohibiting a corporation, such as TAB, from disseminating the\n\nmailers.9 See id. at 372 (concluding unconstitutional to restrict corporate independent expenditures);\n\nsee also Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(8) (defining “direct campaign expenditure”).\n\n                 Further, appellants have not cited, and we have not found, post-Citizens United\n\nauthority that would support appellants’ position that an incorporated trade association such as TAB,\n\nby seeking money from corporations to fund, and then funding, constitutionally protected,\n\nindependent expenditures, subjected itself to the 2002 regulatory scheme directed to political\n\ncommittees. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365; Texans for Free Enter. v. Texas\n\nEthics Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (5th Cir. 2013) (noting “no difference in principle—at least where\n\nthe only asserted state interest is in preventing apparent or actual corruption—between banning an\n\norganization such as TFE from engaging in advocacy and banning it from seeking funds to engage\n\nin that advocacy (or in giving funds to other organizations to allow them to engage in advocacy on\n\nits behalf)”).\n\n                 We are also mindful that we interpret statutes, if possible, in a way that makes them\n\nconstitutional. See City of Pasadena, 292 S.W.3d at 19. Appellants do not contend that TAB was\n\na sham corporation or that it was formed solely for the purpose of “accepting political contributions\n\nor making political expenditures” but argue that its actions surrounding the mailers in 2002 create\n\na fact issue relating to “a principal purpose” in the definition of political committee. See Tex. Elec.\n\n\n\n\n        9\n         Appellants do not contend otherwise. They state in their brief: “Appellants do not contest\nthat corporations have the legal right to spend their own money to try and sway voters towards their\nown preferred slate of candidates.”\n\n                                                  14\n\fCode § 251.001(12).10 Were we to interpret “principal purpose” in the definition of “political\n\ncommittee” as suggested by appellants so that corporations making independent political\n\nexpenditures morph into political committees under the Election Code as it existed in 2002 when\n\nthey made the expenditures, the definition would be an affront to the First Amendment.11 See\n\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365.\n\n               Further, appellants’ suggested definition of “political committee” is inconsistent with\n\nthe framework of the Election Code’s overall scheme. See Parker, 249 S.W.3d at 396 (considering\n\nentire act and not isolated portions when interpreting statutes). The Election Code’s overall scheme\n\ntreats corporations and political committees as distinct types of entities and subjects them to\n\nincompatible provisions. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.031–.043 (provisions directed to political\n\ncommittees, officeholders, and candidates); §§ 253.091–.104 (provisions directed to corporations\n\nand labor organizations). Considering the context of the Election Code’s overall scheme and the\n\nSupreme Court’s directive, we decline to interpret the definition so broadly. See Citizens United,\n\n558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365; City of Pasadena, 292 S.W.3d at 19; see also Tex. Elec. Code\n\n§ 251.001(12); Parker, 249 S.W.3d at 396; King St. Patriots v. Texas Democratic Party,\n\n\n\n       10\n           As previously stated, the definition of a political committee requires that the group have\nas “a principal purpose accepting political contributions or making political expenditures.” Tex. Elec.\nCode § 251.001(12). Applying their common meaning, “purpose” means “[t]he object toward which\none strives or for which something exists; goal; aim.” American Heritage Dictionary of the English\nLanguage 1062 (1973). “Principal” means “[f]irst, highest, or foremost in importance, rank, worth,\nor degree; chief.” Id. at 1041.\n       11\n          The dissent misstates the bases of our holding. The dissent argues that a group of persons\ncould have more than one principal purpose but, even if that were the case, that is not a controlling\nissue here. The controlling issue is the impact and reach of the holding of Citizens United on the\nElection Code provisions at issue, including the scope of the political committee definition in the\ncontext of a corporation’s constitutional right to make independent political expenditures.\n\n                                                  15\n\f__ S.W.3d __, No. 03-12-00255-CV, 2014 Tex.

(in context of First Amendment challenge to definition of “political\n\ncommittee,” applying common meaning of “principal” and “purpose” and “[v]iewing definitions as\n\na whole and in context with each other”).\n\n               Appellants cite a TEC ethics advisory opinion to support their position that TAB is\n\nsubject to the provisions for both corporations and political committees under the Election Code.\n\nSee Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 242 (1995); see also Tex. Elec. Code § 253.092 (addressing\n\ntreatment of incorporated political committee). In the opinion, the TEC concluded that a political\n\ncommittee could incorporate solely for liability purposes without subjecting itself to the limitations\n\nthat the Election Code places on corporations. See Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 242. Section\n\n253.092 of the Election Code similarly states that a political committee that “incorporates for\n\nliability purposes only” is not considered to be a corporation for purposes of subchapter D.12\n\nSee Tex. Elec. Code § 253.092. The opinion and section 253.092 make sense in the scheme of\n\nchapter 253. Otherwise, an incorporated political committee would be foreclosed from provisions\n\nin subchapter B, such as the allowance of campaign contributions, that conflict with restrictions in\n\nsubchapter D, such as the prohibition from making political contributions. See id. §§ 251.001(12),\n\n253.031(c) (allowing campaign contributions), 253.094(a) (prohibiting contributions); see also\n\nColumbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v.

But, in the context of independent expenditures, it does not follow that the\n\ninapplicability of section 253.092 to a corporation supports subjecting the corporation to Election\n\nCode provisions applicable to political committees.13\n\n               Appellants did not present evidence that contradicted TAB’s evidence that its\n\nprincipal purpose was to be an incorporated trade association for the business community. In one\n\nof his affidavits, Hammond testified that TAB “promotes the free enterprise system by working to\n\nimprove the Texas business climate and to help make our state’s economy the strongest in the world”\n\nand that it “lobbies on every issue that impacts business to ensure that employers’ opinions are being\n\nheard.” The summary judgment evidence also included copies of TAB’s budgets for 2001 and 2002\n\nand business reports to its members. The budgets and reports conform with Hammond’s testimony\n\nregarding TAB’s principal purpose as a trade association. One of the reports states that TAB’s\n\nmission is “to build the best business climate on the planet through legislative action on the state and\n\nfederal levels.”\n\n               Here, the evidence was conclusive that TAB did not incorporate solely for liability\n\npurposes, that its principal purpose was to be a trade association for the business community, and\n\nthat its actions surrounding the mailers were independent from campaigns and candidates. Given\n\n\n       13\n           After all, even if a corporation complied with the regulations applicable to political\ncommittees, it still would have violated the Election Code as it existed in 2002 if it made\nindependent political expenditures. See, e.g., Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.031(c) (allowing political\ncommittees to make campaign contributions and expenditures after appointment of campaign\ntreasurer), former 253.094(a) (prohibiting corporation from making political contributions\nand expenditures unless authorized by subchapter); see also id. § 251.001(3) (defining\n“campaign contribution”), (5) (defining “political contribution”); Presidio Indep.

On this basis, we overrule appellants’ first and\n\nthird issues.\n\n\nFormer Section 253.062\n\n                In their second issue, appellants contend in the alternative that TAB violated former\n\nsection 253.062 of the Election Code by making direct campaign expenditures without reporting\n\nsuch expenditures. See Act of June 18, 1997, 1997 Tex. Gen. Laws at 2778. In 2002, section\n\n253.062 prohibited an “individual” from making direct campaign expenditures exceeding $100\n\nunless the individual complied with chapter 254 as if the individual were a campaign treasurer of a\n\npolitical committee. See id.14\n\n                Appellants cite a TEC 2010 advisory opinion to support their position that TAB in\n\n2002 was subject to former section 253.062. See Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 489 (2010). In that\n\nopinion, TEC concluded that corporations that make direct campaign expenditures were required to\n\ncomply with section 253.062.

See Act of May 24, 2011,\n82d Leg., R.S., ch. 1009, § 5, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 1009. Section 254.261 requires a “person” to\nfile reports for direct campaign expenditures exceeding $100. See Tex. Elec.

In its 2010 opinion, the TEC recognized\n\nas much. See Op. Tex. Ethics Comm’n No. 489. It noted that Citizens United created a gap in the\n\ndisclosure requirements for corporations, labor organizations, and other persons:\n\n\n        Title 15 does not explicitly state that a corporation, labor organization, or certain other\n        persons[ ] must file reports to disclose direct campaign expenditures made to support\n        or oppose a candidate. . . . Thus, title 15 did not specifically require disclosure of\n        such expenditures because it simultaneously prohibited them. Citizens United\n        removed our ability to restrict direct campaign expenditures by corporations, labor\n        organizations, and other persons. This result has created a gap or ambiguity in title\n        15 that prompts us to address whether the absence of statutory language specifically\n        addressing these direct campaign expenditures made to support or oppose candidates\n        reflects the legislature’s intent that title 15, in the circumstances following Citizens\n        United, require such expenditures to be disclosed.\n\n\nId. As the TEC recognized in its 2010 opinion, pre-Citizens United, the Election Code limited the\n\ntypes of political expenditures corporations could make. It follows that the legislature could not have\n\nintended for a corporation to disclose prohibited expenditures given that a corporation was not\n\nallowed to make them in the first place. There was no need to have a disclosure requirement for\n\ncorporations because there was nothing to disclose.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    19\n\f               Given the plain language of former section 253.062, we decline to expand the\n\nmeaning of “individual” to subject a corporation to liability for failing to report direct campaign\n\nexpenditures in 2002. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co., 340 S.W.3d at 439 (“We presume that\n\nthe Legislature chooses a statute’s language with care, including each word chosen for a purpose,\n\nwhile purposefully omitting words not chosen.”); Scott, 309 S.W.3d at 930–31. On this basis, we\n\noverrule appellants’ second issue.\n\n\nTAB Employees’ Services to BACPAC\n\n               Appellants’ fourth and fifth issues challenge the trial court’s summary judgment\n\nrulings in favor of TAB and BACPAC as to appellants’ claims regarding the alleged employees’\n\nservices provided by TAB to BACPAC. In their fourth issue, appellants contend that TAB as a\n\ncorporation violated section 253.094(a) because its employees’ services were in-kind political\n\ncontributions and TAB did not present evidence that it restricted the contributions to administrative\n\nmatters. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.094(a) (prohibiting corporations from making political\n\ncontributions), 253.100; Ex parte Ellis, 309 S.W.3d at 88 (discussing section 253.100); see also Tex.\n\nElec. Code § 251.001(2), (3), (5) (defining “contributions,” “political contributions” and “campaign\n\ncontributions”). In their fifth issue, based on the same alleged employees’ services, appellants\n\ncontend that BACPAC violated section 253.003(b) by accepting the in-kind political contributions\n\nfrom TAB. See Tex. Elec. Code § 253.003(b) (“A person may not knowingly accept a political\n\ncontribution the person knows to have been made in violation of this chapter.”).\n\n               In their summary judgment motions, TAB and BACPAC challenged these claims on\n\nthe ground that the mailers were “not factually connected with the criminal charges to which TAB\n\n                                                 20\n\fplead guilty” and appellants did not allege a section 253.002 violation. The evidence was undisputed\n\nthat TAB pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor offense of unlawful direct campaign expenditures under\n\nsection 253.002 of the Election Code concerning TAB employees’ services to BACPAC, and not\n\nto making unlawful in-kind corporate political contributions. See id. § 253.002 (prohibiting person\n\nfrom knowingly making or authorizing direct campaign expenditures with exceptions); see also id.\n\n§ 251.001(2), (3), (5). Further, appellants in their pleadings did not assert a violation of section\n\n253.002 to support their request for statutory damages as to the alleged in-kind employees’\n\nservices, but a violation of section 253.094(a) by TAC and section 253.003(b) by BACPAC. See id.\n\n§§ 253.003(b) (prohibiting knowingly accepting political contributions made in violation of chapter),\n\n.094 (prohibiting corporations from making political contributions not authorized by subchapter D).15\n\nOn this basis, we overrule appellants’ fourth and fifth issues.\n\n\nContributions from CIGNA and CT General to TAB\n\n               In their sixth issue, appellants contend that CT General and CIGNA were not entitled\n\nto summary judgment on appellants’ claims that they made unlawful corporate political contributions\n\nto TAB. Appellants make similar arguments to those made in their first and third issues, arguments\n\nbased on their position that TAB was a political committee. They contend that CIGNA and CT\n\nGeneral violated the Election Code by making contributions to a political committee—TAB—and\n\n\n       15\n          In the section of their Tenth Amended Original Petition titled “Causes of Action,” appellants\nasserted that TAB violated sections 253.004(a), 253.031(b), and 253.037(a) by making political\nexpenditures without a campaign treasurer appointment. See Tex. Elec. Code §§ 253.004(a),\n.031(b), .037(a). As to the alleged “corporate political contributions to BACPAC,” appellants\nspecifically asserted that TAB violated section 253.094(a) and BACPAC violated section\n253.003(b). See id. §§ 253.003(b), .094(a).\n\n                                                  21\n\fthen failing to restrict their contributions to administrative purposes. See id. §§ 253.094(a), 253.100;\n\nEx parte Ellis, 309 S.W.3d at 88.\n\n                Given our conclusion that the summary judgment evidence established as a matter\n\nof law that TAB’s conduct surrounding the mailers did not subject it to the restrictions applicable\n\nto political committees, it follows that CT General and CIGNA did not violate the Election Code by\n\ndonating money to TAB to fund the mailers and that such payments—because they were not made\n\nto a candidate or political committee—did not fall within the definition of contribution under the\n\nElection Code. See Tex. Elec. Code § 251.001(3), (5) (“political contribution” includes a “campaign\n\ncontribution” which means a “contribution to a candidate or a political committee . . .”). Appellants\n\ndo not dispute that CT General and CIGNA could have funded and sent the mailers themselves as\n\nindependent political expenditures. Appellants also have failed to cite, and we have not found, post-\n\nCitizens United authority that would support prohibiting corporations from funding the types of\n\nmailers at issue here. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 341–42, 356, 365; Texans for Free Enter.,\n\n732 F.3d at 538. Further, because we have concluded as a matter of law that the mailers did not\n\nsubject TAB to the provisions of the Election Code applicable to political committees, we need not\n\nreach appellants’ argument that CT General and CIGNA violated the Election Code by making\n\ncontributions to a political committee without restricting the contributions to administrative purposes.\n\nSee Tex. Elec. Code § 253.100.\n\n                To the extent that appellants’ claims against CT General and CIGNA are based on\n\nthe alleged employees’ services from TAB to BACPAC, those claims fail as well. The summary\n\njudgment evidence was conclusive that CT General and CIGNA paid money to TAB to fund the\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fmailers and that TAB used the corporate money exclusively for the mailers. In one of his affidavits,\n\nHammond testified, “During the 2002 state election cycle TAB received in excess of $1.8 million\n\nfrom corporations. The entirety of this money was used to fund TAB’s voter education mailers, as\n\ndescribed below.” Appellants point to another affidavit by Hammond in which he testified that the\n\nmailers were funded through TAB’s general account, “which contains money received from\n\ndues, assessments, and other revenue-producing activities.” But the fact that the mailers were paid\n\nthrough the general account is not inconsistent with and does not refute Hammond’s testimony that\n\nthe corporate money was used solely to fund the mailers.\n\n               We conclude that CT General and CIGNA established as a matter of law that they did\n\nnot make unlawful corporate contributions to TAB and that the trial court, therefore, did not err by\n\ngranting summary judgment in their favor. We overrule appellants’ sixth issue.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               For the reasons stated above, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                              __________________________________________\n\n                                              Melissa Goodwin, Justice\n\nBefore Chief Justice Jones, Justices Rose and Goodwin\n  Dissenting opinion by Chief Justice Jones\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: December 19, 2014\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\f</pre>",
