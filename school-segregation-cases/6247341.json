This case is not about what is good housing policy, however.\n\nThis case is about the rule of law—whether an agency effectively may suspend a duly\n\npromulgated regulation without observing the procedures or identifying relevant factual criteria\n\nthat the law requires to effect such a change. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (“HUD”), without notice and comment or particularized evidentiary findings, has\n\ndelayed almost entirely by two years implementation of a rule requiring over 200 local Public\n\nHousing Authorities (“PHAs”) in 24 metropolitan areas, which HUD selected based on fixed,\n\nobjective criteria, to calculate housing vouchers’ values based on local, rather than metropolitan-\n\nwide, prevailing market rents. The plaintiffs, two voucher holders and a nonprofit organization\n\ndevoted to providing housing opportunities for low-income people in Connecticut, move to\n\npreliminarily enjoin HUD to implement the rule on January 1, 2018, the rule’s effective date.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fPls.’ Mot. Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 15 (“Pls.’ Mot.”). For reasons this Memorandum\n\nOpinion explains in detail, the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\n\nI.       FACTS\n\n         A.        Overview of the Housing Choice Voucher Program and Fair Market Rents\n\n         Congress enacted the Housing Act of 1937 to assist state and local governments “to\n\nremedy unsafe and insanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and\n\nsanitary dwellings for families of low income.” Pub. L. No. 75-412, § 1, 50 Stat. 888, 888\n\n(1937) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437(a)). The Housing and Community Development Act of\n\n1974, enacted nearly 40 years later, amended the Housing Act to add Section 8, which authorized\n\nHUD to contract with PHAs to pay landlords rental subsidies on low-income tenants’ behalf.\n\nPub. L. No. 93-383, § 8(a), 88 Stat. 633, 662 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a)). The Housing\n\nand Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-181, § 207, 97 Stat. 1153, 1181 (codified\n\nas amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)), created the Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”) program,\n\nwhich is HUD’s “major program for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the\n\ndisabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market.” Housing Choice\n\nVouchers Fact Sheet, U.S. DEP’T HOUSING & URB. DEV.,\n\nhttps://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8 (last visited Dec. 23,\n\n2017) (“HCV Fact Sheet”). 1 HUD oversees the HCV program, directing funds to PHAs to\n\nadminister the program locally by issuing vouchers to qualified individuals and families, who use\n\nthose vouchers to secure housing in the private rental market. Id. A voucher holder may use a\n\nvoucher toward any housing that meets the HCV program’s requirements, subject to a PHA’s\n\n\n1\n        Federal Rule of Evidence 201 allows a court to take judicial notice of “a fact that is not subject to\nreasonable dispute because it . . . is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or . . . can be\naccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” FED. R. EVID.\n201(b). Both of these conditions apply to a description of the HCV program found on HUD’s public website.\n\n                                                             2\n\fapproval. 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(2). HCV participation is limited to low-income households,\n\nwhich typically cannot afford to rent dwellings for which the rent substantially exceeds the HCV\n\nprogram payment standard. See HCV Fact Sheet, supra; see, e.g., Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 9, Decl. of\n\nTiara Moore (“Moore Decl.”) ¶¶ 3, 7, ECF No. 15-9.\n\n       A voucher’s value is calculated largely on the basis of HUD’s determination of the “fair-\n\nmarket rent” (“FMR”) for a dwelling of a particular size and type (e.g., a two-bedroom home).\n\n24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1). An FMR represents the amount required “to rent standard quality\n\nhousing throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in competition,”\n\nincluding “the cost of utilities, except telephone.” Id. § 888.113(a). HUD annually calculates\n\nand publishes in the Federal Register FMRs for different types of units in each market area as\n\nwell as any proposed changes to FMR calculation procedures. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1)(B); see\n\nalso 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1). PHAs, in turn, use FMR calculations to establish “payment\n\nstandard amounts” for each unit type. 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1).\n\n       A PHA generally sets a payment standard “between 90 percent and 110 percent of the\n\npublished FMR for that unit size.” Id. § 982.503(b). A voucher holder typically pays a landlord\n\n30 percent of her or his adjusted monthly income toward rent; the PHA pays the rent’s balance\n\ndirectly to the landlord, so long as a dwelling’s actual gross rent is at or below the relevant\n\npayment standard. Id. § 982.1(a)(3). If, however, a dwelling’s actual rent exceeds the payment\n\nstandard, the voucher holder pays the balance. Id. A PHA may use the same payment standard\n\namount for all areas within the PHA’s jurisdiction, or else “may establish a separate payment\n\nstandard amount for each designated part of the FMR area.” Id. § 982.503(a)(3).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       B.      Problems with FMR Calculations in Metropolitan Areas\n\n       FMRs often do not, in practice, accurately reflect rents actually charged in neighborhoods\n\nwithin a broad metropolitan area, as “rents can vary widely within a metropolitan area depending\n\nupon the size of the metropolitan area and the neighborhood in the metropolitan area within\n\nwhich one resides.” See Establishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small\n\nArea Fair Market Rents in the Housing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th\n\nPercentile FMRs, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567, 80,567 (Nov. 16, 2016) (“Final Rule”). Consequently,\n\n“[t]he result of determining rents on the basis of an entire metropolitan area is that a voucher\n\nsubsidy . . . may be too low to cover market rent in a given neighborhood.” Id. FMRs calculated\n\non metropolitan-wide bases may not enable voucher holders to afford rents in high-rent, high-\n\nopportunity neighborhoods, consigning them to low-opportunity areas of concentrated poverty.\n\nSee id.; Moore Decl. ¶¶ 5–7; Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 4, Decl. of Crystal Carter (“Carter Decl.”) ¶¶ 6–\n\n7, ECF No. 15-4. Calculating FMRs locally, in contrast, makes rents in high-opportunity areas\n\nmore affordable.\n\n       Prior to 2000, HUD generally calculated FMRs to reflect the 40th percentile rent in a\n\ngiven metropolitan area. See 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a)–(b). In 2000, however, HUD published a\n\nnew rule authorizing PHAs in areas meeting specified criteria to calculate payment standards\n\nbased on FMRs reflecting the 50th percentile rent in a given area. See Fair Market Rents:\n\nIncreased Fair Market Rents and Higher Payment Standards for Certain Areas, 65 Fed. Reg.\n\n58,870, 58,870 (Oct. 2, 2000). This new policy was “designed to achieve two fundamental\n\nprogram objectives: (1) Ensuring that low-income families are successful in finding and leasing\n\ndecent and affordable housing; and (2) ensuring that low-income families have access to a broad\n\nrange of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area.” Id. Consistent with these goals,\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fthe 50th Percentile Rule authorized PHAs to calculate payment standards using a 50th percentile\n\nFMR under two circumstances: where “families are having difficulty using housing vouchers to\n\nfind and lease decent and affordable housing” and “a FMR increase is most needed to promote\n\nresidential choice, help families move closer to areas of job growth, and deconcentrate poverty.”\n\nId. FMR calculation would revert to a 40th percentile basis, however, in PHAs that experienced\n\nno or an insufficient decrease in concentration of voucher holders after three years. Id. at 58,871.\n\n       HUD has concluded, based on recent research, that the 50th Percentile Rule is “not an\n\neffective tool” for “increasing HCV tenant moves from areas of low opportunity to higher\n\nopportunity areas.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,570. Rather, HUD has found that “much of\n\nthe benefit of increased FMRs simply accrues to landlords in lower rent submarket areas in the\n\nform of higher rents rather than creating an incentive for tenants to move to units in communities\n\nwith more and/or better opportunities.” Id. HUD also observed that a “large number of areas\n\nhave been disqualified from the 50th percentile program for failure to show measurable\n\nreduction in voucher concentration of HCV tenants since 2001 when the program started, which\n\nstrongly suggests that the deconcentration objective is not being met.” Id.\n\n       C.      The Small Area FMR Demonstration Project\n\n       In the wake of the 50th Percentile Rule’s apparent failure, HUD considered alternative\n\nways to expand housing opportunities for voucher holders. See id. Using census data collected\n\nthrough the American Community Survey, HUD developed “Small Area FMRs” (“SAFMRs”),\n\nwhich reflect fair-market rents in individual ZIP codes, rather than in broad metropolitan areas.\n\nId. HUD’s goal in applying this new, more targeted methodology was to “create more effective\n\nmeans for HCV tenants to move into higher opportunity, lower poverty areas by providing them\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fwith subsidy adequate to make such areas accessible and to thereby reduce the number of\n\nvoucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.” Id. 2\n\n        HUD undertook a demonstration project to test SAFMRs’ effectiveness. Section 8\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program Demonstration Project of Small Area Fair Market Rents in\n\nCertain Metropolitan Areas for Fiscal Year 2011, 75 Fed. Reg. 27,808, 27,809 (May 18, 2010)\n\n(“Proposed Demonstration Project”). Notably, HUD recognized, in announcing the project, that\n\n“[t]he small area FMR demonstration project will not be effective unless the PHAs that operate\n\nvoucher programs covering the vast majority of voucher tenants in a metropolitan area agree to\n\nparticipate and abide by the small area rents.” Id. at 27,811. In a subsequent notice describing\n\nthe project in more detail, HUD explained that SAFMRs “represent a fundamentally different\n\nway of operating the voucher program in metropolitan areas,” and that the project would help\n\nHUD “to better understand the programmatic impacts of changing the way voucher payment\n\nstandards are set.” Final Fair Market Rents for the Housing Choice Voucher Program for Small\n\nArea Fair Market Rent Demonstration Program Participants; Fiscal Year 2013, 77 Fed. Reg.\n\n69,651, 69,652 (Nov. 20, 2012) (“Demonstration Project”). HUD identified two purposes that\n\nthe demonstration project would serve: to (1) “evaluate [SAFMRs] in terms of effectiveness in\n\nmeeting the primary goal of improving tenants’ housing choices in areas of opportunity while\n\nalso assessing the impact on tenants in areas with SAFMRs below the metropolitan-wide FMR”\n\n\n\n2\n         Although SAFMRs are a recent innovation, HUD recognized the shortcomings of FMR schedules based on\nmetropolitan area-wide, rather than more localized, rent levels as early as 1977. See COMPTROLLER GEN. OF THE\nU.S., CED-77-19, M AJOR CHANGES A RE NEEDED IN THE NEW LEASED-HOUSING PROGRAM 21 (1977) (“HUD’s\ndecision to prepare single FMR schedules for entire SMSAs [Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas] or for\ncounties grouped into areas totaling 250,000 population is questionable. This approach ignores important\ndistinctions between metropolitan central cities and suburban areas as well as among suburban areas within SMSAs,\nand it does not adequately consider the economic and demographic differences among non-SMSA counties. For\nexample, the San Francisco-Oakland, California, SMSA had identical FMRs for the counties of Alameda, Contra\nCosta, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo. HUD field office officials said that each of these counties’ actual\nmarket rents could vary by 30 to 40 percent.”).\n\n                                                       6\n\fand (2) “understand and evaluate the administrative and budget impacts of converting and\n\noperating the tenant-based voucher program using SAFMRs.” Id. In selecting pilot PHAs to\n\nparticipate in the demonstration project, HUD used seven fixed, objective criteria to define an\n\ninitial pool of eligible PHAs, then “randomly selected” pilot areas “from stratified sets of eligible\n\nPHAs.” Id. HUD ultimately selected five pilot PHAs from this pool: the (1) Chattanooga\n\n(Tenn.) Housing Authority, (2) Housing Authority of the City of Laredo (Tex.), (3) Housing\n\nAuthority of the City of Long Beach (Cal.), (4) Housing Authority of the County of Cook (Ill.),\n\nand (5) Town of Mamaroneck (N.Y.) Public Housing Agency. Id. HUD also included all\n\nDallas, Texas, metropolitan area PHAs, which since 2010 had implemented SAFMRs pursuant\n\nto a settlement agreement, in the demonstration project. Id. at 69,652 n.2; Proposed Fair Market\n\nRents for the Housing Choice Voucher Program and Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room\n\nOccupancy Program Fiscal Year 2011, 75 Fed. Reg. 46,958, 46,962 (Aug. 4, 2010).\n\n       D.      The SAFMR Rule\n\n       Before the demonstration project’s completion, HUD published advance notice of\n\nproposed rulemaking announcing the agency’s intent to require several other metropolitan areas\n\nmeeting certain criteria to implement SAFMRs. See Establishing a More Effective Fair Market\n\nRent (FMR) System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) in Housing Choice\n\nVoucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs; Advanced Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking, 80 Fed. Reg. 31,332 (June 2, 2015). HUD cited in this advance notice “research\n\nand experience with the SAFMR demonstration” indicating “that amending its current FMR\n\nregulation to enable adoption of the SAFMR methodology could provide HCV tenants greater\n\naccess to higher opportunity, lower poverty neighborhoods.” Id. at 31,333. As part of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fadvance notice, HUD also announced that the new Rule “would eliminate the use of 50th\n\npercentile FMRs as a means to reduce HCV tenant concentration.” Id.\n\n       One year later, on June 16, 2016, HUD published a notice of the proposed new rule. See\n\nEstablishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents in\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs, 81 Fed. Reg.\n\n39,218 (June 16, 2016) (“NPRM”). In doing so, HUD acknowledged that “[i]n order for Small\n\nArea FMRs to work in expanding choice for voucher holders within designated metropolitan\n\nareas, all PHAs operating in the FMR area would be required to use Small Area FMRs.” Id. at\n\n39,224. The proposed rule addressed concerns raised in response to the advance notice and\n\nsought additional comments on specific issues, including policies HUD should adopt to “mitigate\n\nthe impact of significant and abrupt decreases in the FMRs for certain ZIP code areas on families\n\n. . . in those impacted areas” and whether “this policy change would be particularly burdensome”\n\nto any “specific groups within the general population of voucher holders.” Id. at 39,225.\n\n       HUD published a final rule on November 16, 2016. Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567.\n\nCalculating payment standards based on SAFMRs, HUD said, would “provid[e] . . . a subsidy\n\nadequate to make such [high-opportunity, low-poverty] areas accessible and, consequently, help\n\nreduce the number of voucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.” Id. at\n\n80,567. “ZIP codes,” HUD reasoned, “are small enough to reflect neighborhood differences and\n\nprovide an easier method of comparing rents within one ZIP code to another ZIP code area\n\nwithin a metropolitan area.” Id. at 80,568. The rule contained several provisions to address\n\nconcerns about SAFMRs’ potential adverse impacts on voucher holders in low-rent ZIP codes.\n\nId. at 80,572. Particularly relevant here, the rule authorized HUD to “suspend a Small Area\n\nFMR designation for a metropolitan area . . . where HUD determines such action is warranted\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fbased on a documented finding of adverse rental housing market conditions that will be set out\n\nby notice,” id. at 80,569, enumerating three circumstances that could warrant a designation’s\n\nsuspension or PHA’s exemption from the SAFMR mandate, 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4). HUD\n\nprovided by notice that the new rule would go into effect on October 1, 2017, requiring affected\n\nPHAs to implement the rule by January 1, 2018, Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 81,569; 24 C.F.R. §\n\n982.503(b)(1), and designated 24 metropolitan areas, which covered over 200 PHAs in total,\n\nsubject to the Rule based on five fixed, objective criteria, see Small Area Fair Market Rents in\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program Values for Selection Criteria and Metropolitan Areas Subject\n\nto Small Area Fair Market Rents, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,678, 80,679 (Nov. 16, 2016) (“SAFMR Area\n\nDesignations”); Defs.’ Opp’n Pls.’ Mot. (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), Attach. 1, Decl. of Todd Richardson,\n\nActing Gen. Deputy Assistant Sec’y for Pol’y Dev. & Research (“HUD Decl.”) ¶ 5, ECF No. 24-\n\n1. In so doing, HUD required all PHAs within affected metropolitan areas to implement\n\nSAFMRs. These metropolitan areas included the Dallas, Texas area, SAFMR Area Designations,\n\n81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679, in which PHAs, pursuant to the earlier-referenced settlement agreement,\n\nalready had implemented SAFMRs, see NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,221.\n\n       E.      The Interim Report’s Preliminary Findings\n\n       After HUD announced the Rule’s promulgation, but before the Rule was set to go into\n\neffect, HUD received preliminary findings from the demonstration project in the form of an\n\nInterim Report titled Small Area Fair Market Rent Demonstration Evaluation. Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex.\n\n1 (“Interim Report”), ECF No. 24-4. This report contained good news on SAFMRs efficacy to\n\nachieve Section 8’s statutory goals, with mixed results for some demonstration project PHAs.\n\n       Specifically, the Interim Report found that SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs make “the\n\navailability of units [] much more evenly distributed across different types of neighborhoods,\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fleading to increased availability in high-rent ZIP Codes and reduced availability in low-rent ZIP\n\nCodes.” Interim Report at vii; see also id. at viii (“Because SAFMRs increase access to high-\n\nrent ZIP Codes and reduce access to low-rent ZIP Codes, we found not unexpectedly that the\n\ntransition to SAFMRs led to an increase in units potentially available to HCV holders in higher-\n\nopportunity areas under SAFMRs compared with FMRs and fewer units in lower opportunity\n\nareas.”). As a result, “[f]ollowing the implementation of SAFMRs, HCV holders in the\n\ndemonstration sites are slightly more likely to live in high-rent ZIP Codes than they were prior to\n\nthe demonstration,” while no such change was observed in “comparison PHAs.” Id. at viii.\n\nFurther, “[t]he slight changes in rents among the SAFMR PHAs also translate into slight changes\n\nin opportunity.” Id.; see also id. at ix (finding that “[a]cross all evaluation PHAs . . . changes in\n\nrents are also reflected in changes in access to opportunity.”). Moreover, Housing Assistance\n\nPayment (“HAP”) costs, which “are the subsidy costs that PHAs incur on behalf of HCV holders\n\nfor rent and utilities,” “declined in real terms per unit between 2010 and 2015 in SAFMR\n\nPHAs,” while “[r]ents paid to landlords remained nearly flat in real terms between 2010 and\n\n2015 but varied by rent category.” Id. at x. The report states, “[i]n summary, it appears that\n\nSmall Area Fair Market Rents are working as intended—increasing access to units in higher-\n\nopportunity areas and decreasing access in lower-opportunity areas.” Id. at 61.\n\n       At the same time, the Interim Report troublingly found that “the gain in units with rents\n\nbelow the applicable FMR in high-rent ZIP Codes does not offset the decrease in the number of\n\nunits in the low-rent and moderate-rent ZIP Codes, resulting in a net loss of units potentially\n\navailable to HCV holders overall.” Id. at vii. The net effect of SAFMR implementation across\n\nthe pilot PHAs, the Interim Report found, was “a loss of over 22,000 units (3.4 percent) that\n\nmight otherwise be affordable to HCV holders.” Id. In addition, the Interim Report noted that\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\faverage payment standard amounts declined by about 11 percent in inflation-adjusted terms in\n\npilot PHAs, resulting in average rent burden increases for HCV voucher holders of about 16\n\npercent overall and 22 percent in low-income ZIP codes. Id. at ix–x. In contrast, payment\n\nstandard amounts relying on metropolitan area-wide FMRs declined by only about 2 percent,\n\nresulting in an average rent burden increase of 9 percent. Id.\n\n       The Interim Report’s findings related only to Phase 1 of the demonstration project. Id. at\n\nxi. In 2018, HUD will receive a Final Report combining and synthesizing data collected in\n\nPhases 1 and 2, the latter of which will (1) update the Interim Report’s empirical analyses with\n\nnew housing data, and (2) use qualitative interviews of tenants and landlords to determine how\n\nSAFMRs have affected or could affect housing decisions. Id. at xi, 98.\n\n       F.      HUD’s Two-Year Delay of the SAFMR Rule\n\n       On August 10, 2017, HUD issued a memorandum delaying SAFMR designations for 23\n\nof the 24 metropolitan areas subject to the Rule (excluding Dallas), requiring PHAs in affected\n\nareas to implement the Rule in 2020 rather than in 2018. Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex. 2, Suspension of\n\nSmall Area Fair Market Rent (FMR) Designations (“Suspension Mem.”) at 2, ECF No. 24-5.\n\nThe Suspension Memo expressly noted, however, that “any PHA operating in the covered\n\nmetropolitan areas” could still “voluntarily implement[] the use of Small Area FMRs prior to . . .\n\n2019,” and that PHAs in the Dallas metropolitan area would continue to implement SAFMRs\n\npursuant to the settlement agreement. Id. at 1, 3. On August 11, 2017, HUD sent over 200\n\naffected PHAs a letter informing those PHAs that their metropolitan areas’ mandatory SAFMR\n\ndesignations were suspended until 2020.

(“Letter to\n\nPHAs”) (Aug. 11, 2017), ECF No. 24-6; HUD Decl. ¶ 12.\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f        The Suspension Memo identified “several findings” in the Interim Report “that are\n\nworrisome and where further research is needed to address a number of critical questions with\n\nrespect to the potential harm to HCV families (both participants and applicants) in areas\n\ntransitioning to Small Area FMRs.” Id. at 5. “[F]indings of the interim report that are of most\n\nconcern to HUD,” the Suspension Memo stated, “relate to the availability of units and the impact\n\nof Small Area FMRs on voucher success rates and utilization, and to rent burdens among assisted\n\nhouseholds.” Id. Specifically, the Suspension Memo stated that “[o]ne of the findings of\n\nconcern from the interim report is that the gain in units with rents below the applicable FMR in\n\nhigh-rent ZIP codes did not offset the decrease in the number of units in the low-rent and\n\nmoderate-rent ZIP codes.” Id. The Suspension Memo acknowledged that, by contrast to the\n\noperation of SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs, the Rule capped any SAFMR decrease to 10 percent\n\nper year, but concluded that this provision “may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as\n\nopposed to preventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families in the\n\nmetropolitan area.” Id. at 5–6. The Suspension Memo also recounted the Interim Report’s\n\nfindings that SAFMRs have potential to increase voucher holders’ rent burdens. Id. at 6. The\n\nSuspension Memo again acknowledged that, by contrast to the operation of SAFMRs in the pilot\n\nPHAs, the Rule allows PHAs to hold nonmoving families harmless from payment standard\n\namount decreases, but noted that “there is no protection for families that must move to a new unit\n\nor for applicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the\n\nfirst time.” Id. at 7.\n\n        The Suspension Memo identified two other concerns with respect to implementing the\n\nRule. The first concern was that “several PHA industry groups have [expressed] concerns about\n\nthe Small Area FMR final rule and the timeline for implementation” in response to a separate\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fFederal Register notice on reducing regulatory burdens. Id. (citing Reducing Regulatory Burden;\n\nEnforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda Under Executive Order 13777, 82 Fed. Reg. 22,344\n\n(May 15, 2017)). The Suspension Memo recognized that “HUD has not yet completed its\n\nanalysis of these public comments,” but asserted that “[t]emporarily suspending the Small Area\n\nFMR designation until FY 2020 will allow HUD to be informed by the public comments on\n\nreducing regulatory burden for the HCV program as well as the Final Report . . . before the use\n\nof Small Area FMRs is required.” Id. The second concern was that developing and issuing\n\n“guidance and planning to provide technical assistance to assist PHAs that must implement”\n\nSAFMRs “without fully understanding and incorporating the lessons learned from the\n\nDemonstration will result in a product that does not adequately assist those PHAs that must make\n\nthis [] transition.” Id. at 8. Relatedly, HUD noted that “[i]mplementing comprehensive guidance\n\nthat may become quickly outdated as the result of related regulatory burden reduction and reform\n\nefforts is likewise problematic.” Id.\n\n       G.      The Plaintiffs\n\n       The plaintiffs are two African-American women living in metropolitan areas the Rule\n\nwould affect, as well as Open Communities Alliance (“OCA”), a nonprofit organization devoted\n\nto providing social and economic opportunities for low-income people.

The Instant Litigation\n\n         On October 23, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a complaint challenging the Rule’s delay, see\n\nCompl., and, on November 8, 2017, moved for a preliminary injunction that would require HUD\n\nto implement the Rule without delay or modification by January 1, 2018, Pls.’ Mot.

The plaintiffs did not request an\nexpedited hearing, and in any event, the Court finds that the parties’ consent to modification of the original\nscheduling order, see Minute Order, dated Nov. 8, 2017, which moved briefing’s conclusion back to December 11,\n2017, obviates any concern regarding prejudice to the parties occasioned by the hearing date.\n\n                                                          14\n\fII.

Whether a plaintiff must show\n\neach of the four factors independently, or else may make a sufficiently “strong showing on one\n\nfactor [to] make up for a weaker showing on another,” remains an open question in the D.C.\n\nCircuit. Id. at 7 (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)). 4\n\nIII.     DISCUSSION\n\n\n\n\n4\n          The Supreme Court, in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008), has\nsuggested that a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must show each factor separately. Winter referred to the\nfour factors conjunctively, holding that such a plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that\nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his\nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” 555 U.S. at 20. Winter also rejected the contention that\n“when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be\nentered based only on a ‘possibility’ of irreparable harm,” holding that “plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief [must]\ndemonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” Id. at 21–22 (emphasis in original).\nThe D.C. Circuit repeatedly has observed that “the so-called ‘sliding-scale’ approach to weighing the four\npreliminary injunction factors” may no longer be viable post-Winter, but has never resolved this question one way or\nthe other. League of Women Voters, 883 F.3d at 7; see also Pursuing Am.’s Greatness, 831 F.3d at 505 n.1 (“We\nneed not resolve here any tension in the case law regarding the showing required on the merits for a preliminary\ninjunction.”); Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“[I]t remains an open question whether the\n‘likelihood of success’ factor is ‘an independent, free-standing requirement,’ or whether, in cases where the other\nthree factors strongly favor issuing an injunction, a plaintiff need only raise a ‘serious legal question’ on the merits. .\n. . But we have no need to resolve this question here because the remaining factors do not, in any event, weigh in\npetitioners’ favor.”); Sherley, 644 F.3d at 392–93 (“[W]e read Winter at least to suggest if not to hold that a\nlikelihood of success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n                                                           16\n\f        The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction requiring HUD to implement the Rule on its\n\neffective date of January 1, 2018. Pls.’ Mot. Their motion challenges the lawfulness of HUD’s\n\ntwo-year delay of the Rule’s implementation in ways relating to claims in the complaint. 5 First,\n\nthe plaintiffs argue that HUD failed to adhere to the requirements of notice and comment\n\nprocedure in delaying the Rule’s implementation. Pls.’ Mem. at 22–27; see Compl. ¶ 143–48.\n\nThe defendants acknowledge HUD delayed the Rule’s implementation without notice or\n\ncomment, but argue that HUD had authority under a promulgated regulation, 24 C.F.R. §\n\n888.113(c)(4), to suspend SAFMR designations and exempt PHAs without resort to notice and\n\ncomment, Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27. The plaintiffs dispute that this regulation conferred such\n\nauthority upon HUD. Pls.’ Mem. at 24–27. Second, the plaintiffs argue that HUD’s delay of the\n\nRule’s implementation was arbitrary and capricious because HUD failed to provide an adequate\n\nexplanation for the delay. Id. at 28–34; see Compl. ¶¶ 149–57. The plaintiffs contend that the\n\nRule’s delayed implementation will irreparably harm them, and that both the balance of equities\n\nand consideration of the public interest weigh in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction. Pls.’\n\nMem. at 34–43. Here, for reasons explained in further detail below, the plaintiffs have carried\n\ntheir burdens of demonstrating all four factors, and so merit a preliminary injunction under either\n\nthe “independent factors” or “sliding scale” approach.\n\n         A.       Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n         The plaintiffs’ (1) notice and comment and (2) arbitrary and capricious claims boil down\n\nto a common issue—whether HUD identified adverse rental housing market conditions local to\n\nthe particular PHAs as to which HUD delayed the Rule’s implementation. For reasons explained\n\n\n5\n        The complaint also raises a third claim, asserting that HUD acted contrary to statute in delaying the Rule’s\nimplementation by distributing housing funds in a manner that perpetuates racial segregation and does not provide\nopportunity to rent quality housing throughout a metropolitan area. Compl. ¶¶ 158–163. The plaintiffs’ motion\ndoes not address this argument, and the defendants do not respond to it. See generally Pls.’ Mot.; Defs.’ Opp’n.\n\n                                                        17\n\fbelow, HUD did not. HUD’s failure to connect the Rule’s delayed implementation in specific\n\nPHAs by reference to local conditions means 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) gave the agency no\n\nauthority to act without notice and comment, and also that HUD’s decision-making was arbitrary\n\nand capricious. The plaintiffs thus have shown likely success on their claims’ merits.\n\n        1.       HUD Lacked Authority to Delay the Rule’s Implementation.\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that they likely will succeed on the merits of their claim that HUD’s\n\ndelay of the Rule is procedurally defective because HUD did not observe the requirements of\n\nnotice and comment. Pls.’ Mem. at 22–27. HUD, invoking a provision of the Rule, argues\n\nunsuccessfully that the Secretary has broad authority to delay the Rule’s implementation\n\nwholesale whenever the Secretary determines he has reason to do so. Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27;\n\nHr’g Tr. (Dec. 19, 2017) at 30. 6 The plaintiffs, relying on the same Rule provision, argue that\n\nthe Secretary’s authority is more circumscribed, and does not reach HUD’s action here. Hr’g Tr.\n\nat 7. “To choose between those competing [constructions], we look to the context in which the\n\nwords appear.” McDonnell v. United States, 136 S. Ct. 2355, 2368 (2016). The Court concludes\n\nthat although HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA within such a\n\ndesignated area under circumstances in which SAFMRs may adversely impact the area or PHA’s\n\nrental housing unit supply, HUD has made no such area-specific showing with respect to the 23\n\nmetropolitan areas as to which the agency delayed the Rule’s implementation. As such, the\n\nplaintiffs have demonstrated likely success on the merits on their notice and comment claim. 7\n\n\n\n\n6\n          All citations to the December 19, 2017 hearing transcript cite to a rough draft of the transcript. A final\ndraft of the transcript is forthcoming and will be made available on this case’s docket. Discrepancies between the\nrough and final transcript drafts regarding page numbers may exist.\n7\n          The defendants’ argument that HUD soon will rescind the Rule through notice and comment and thus moot\nthe plaintiffs’ notice and comment claim, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 31, only underscores that HUD has not yet invoked\nnotice and comment, and thus, that the plaintiffs’ claim is not moot. The issue of whether HUD’s planned action\nwould moot the plaintiffs’ claim is not yet ripe for review.\n\n                                                        18\n\f       The APA generally requires a federal agency engaged in informal rulemaking to engage\n\nin notice and comment procedures. See 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)–(c). “[A]n agency issuing a\n\nlegislative rule is itself bound by the rule until that rule is amended or revoked and may not alter\n\nsuch a rule without notice and comment. Clean Air Council v. Pruitt, 862 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2017) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). “[A]n order delaying [a] rule’s\n\neffective date” is “tantamount to amending or revoking a rule.” Id. at 6; see also Nat. Res.

Abraham, 355 F.3d 179, 194 (2d Cir. 2004) (“[A]ltering the effective date of a duly\n\npromulgated standard could be, in substance, tantamount to an amendment or rescission of the\n\nstandard[].”); Envt’l Def. Fund, Inc. v. EPA, 716 F.2d 915, 920 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (“[S]uspension\n\nor delayed implementation of a final regulation normally constitutes substantive rulemaking\n\nunder APA § 553.”); Council of S. Mountains, Inc. v. Donovan, 653 F.2d 573, 580 n.28 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1981) (concluding that an order “deferring the requirement that coal operators supply life-\n\nsaving equipment to miners, [that] had palpable effects upon the regulated industry and the\n\npublic in general,” is “a substantive rule”); Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. U.S. EPA, 683 F.2d\n\n752, 762 (3d Cir. 1982) (“If the effective date were not part of an agency statement such that\n\nmaterial alterations in that date would be subject to the rulemaking provisions of the APA, . . . an\n\nagency could guide a future rule through the rulemaking process, promulgate a final rule, and\n\nthen effectively repeal it, simply by indefinitely postponing its operative date.” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).\n\n       The Rule, which requires PHAs administering the HCV program in select metropolitan\n\nareas to use, as of January 1, 2018, SAFMRs, unquestionably is a substantive regulation delay of\n\nwhich ordinarily would require notice and comment. HUD, however, did not delay the Rule’s\n\nimplementation through notice and comment. Thus, HUD’s action was lawful only if another\n\n\n\n                                                 19\n\fsource of authority empowered HUD to delay the Rule’s implementation without notice or\n\ncomment. HUD asserts that 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c) conferred such authority. HUD is wrong.\n\n               a)      Section 888.113(c)(4)’s Meaning\n\n       HUD’s failure to use notice and comment means that the agency’s authority to delay the\n\nRule’s implementation must flow, if at all, from § 888.113(c)(4). Section 888.113(c)(4) allows\n\nHUD to temporarily suspend a region’s SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA from use of\n\nSAFMRs under specified circumstances. The regulation provides, in relevant part:\n\n       HUD may suspend a Small Area FMR designation from a metropolitan area, or\n       may temporarily exempt a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area from use\n       of the Small Area FMRs, when HUD by notice makes a documented determination\n       that such action is warranted. Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension\n       of Small Area FMRs are:\n\n       (i)     A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a substantial\n               number of housing units;\n\n       (ii)    A sudden influx of displaced households needing permanent housing; or\n\n       (iii)   Other events as determined by the Secretary.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\n       Section 888.133(c)(4)’s plain language makes clear that HUD may suspend an SAFMR\n\ndesignation or exempt a PHA only upon one of three enumerated actions’ occurrence. Further,\n\nunder the canon of ejusdem generis, which “limits general terms which follow specific ones to\n\nmatters similar to those specified,” Wallaesa v. FAA, 824 F.3d 1071, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2016)\n\n(quoting Gooch v. United States, 297 U.S. 124, 128 (1936)), the third action must be construed to\n\nreach only events “of the same class as those listed” in the preceding exemplar actions, DeNaples\n\nv.

Mattel, Inc., 552 U.S. 576, 586 (2008) (“Under\n\nth[e] rule [of ejusdem generis], when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a\n\ngeneral term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it\n\nfollows.”); Cole v.

Cir. 1997) (“[T]he rule of\n\nejusdem generis . . . limits general terms which follow specific ones to matters similar to those\n\nspecified.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       Section 888.113(c)(4)’s first two enumerated actions each involve changes to local rental\n\nhousing market conditions that drive rents up, to voucher holders’ detriment. The over-arching\n\nrationale for HUD’s suspension authority that the Rule’s preamble sets out confirms the\n\nenumerated examples’ focus on local rental housing conditions. There, the Rule states that an\n\nSAFMR designation’s suspension requires “a documented finding of adverse rental housing\n\nmarket conditions.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,569. “[L]anguage in the preamble of a\n\nregulation,” though “not controlling over the language of the regulation itself . . . is evidence of\n\nan agency’s contemporaneous understanding of its proposed rules.” Wyo. Outdoor Council v.\n\nU.S. Forest Serv., 165 F.3d 43, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Were the third action—“Other events as\n\ndetermined by the Secretary”—intended to allow the Secretary unfettered discretion to suspend\n\nan SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA for any reason, the two other enumerated examples\n\nwould be mere surplusage. As the Supreme Court has stressed in applying the canon of ejusdem\n\ngeneris, if the disputed phrase was intended to have such a broad meaning “it is hard to see why”\n\nthe examples needed to be included at all. Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 142 (2008); see\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\falso CSX Transp., Inc. v. Ala. Dep’t of Revenue, 562 U.S. 277, 295 (2011) (“We typically\n\nuse ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless.”).\n\n       The Supreme Court’s reasoning in Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233 (2010), is instructive.\n\nThe Attorney General claimed broad, unreviewable discretion, under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B),\n\nto act on a motion to reopen alien removal proceedings, but the Court held otherwise. 558 U.S.\n\nat 237. The Court examined the provision’s two clauses insulating from judicial review, in\n\nclause (i), certain discretionary administrative judgments authorized by specific statutes, and, in\n\nclause (ii), “any other decision . . . the authority for which is specified under this subchapter.”\n\nId. at 246. Citing the “lead line” introducing both clauses, the “proximity of clauses (i) and (ii)\n\nand the words linking them—‘any other decision,’” the Supreme Court reasoned that “[t]he\n\nclause (i) enumeration . . . is instructive in determining the meaning of the clause (ii) catchall,”\n\nultimately reasoning “that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre,” namely, “that\n\nCongress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the\n\nAttorney General’s discretionary authority in the statute.” Id. at 24647. Consequently, the Court\n\nheld, the judicial review bar encompassed only administrative decisions made discretionary by\n\nstatute, not by regulation. Id. at 253–54. As with Kucana, the “lead line” in § 888.113(c)(4) is\n\n“Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs are . . . ,” which places\n\nall three enumerated actions that follow within the category of actions that justify an SAFMR\n\nsuspension or PHA exemption. These actions’ proximity to the lead line and to one another, as\n\nwell as the “[o]ther events” term linking the actions, shows that § 888.113(c)(4), “[r]ead\n\nharminously,” lets HUD suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA only for reasons “of\n\nthe same genre” as those in the first two enumerated actions. Kucana, 558 at 246–47.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f         Begay likewise is clarifying. The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a sentencing\n\nenhancement on a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and has three prior convictions\n\n“for a violent felony,” defined in part to mean a felony that “is burglary, arson, or extortion,\n\ninvolves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\n\nphysical injury to another.” 18 U.S.C. § 922(e)(2)(B)(ii). “[T]he provision’s listed examples,”\n\nBegay reasoned, “illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute’s scope” and “indicates\n\nthat the statute covers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury to another.” 553 U.S. at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA Congress intending “the statute to be all encompassing” Begay said, likely would not “have\n\nneeded to include the examples at all,” as the statute “would cover all crimes that present a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury” absent the examples. Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “These considerations taken together,” Begay concluded, “convince us that, to give\n\neffect to every clause and word of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the\n\ncrimes that [the statute] covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of\n\nrisk posed, to the examples themselves.” Id. at 143 (alterations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Here, as in Begay, § 888.113(c)(4)’s “listed examples” limit the third action’s scope to\n\nactions “that are roughly similar” to the first two actions. Id. at 142–43. The third action thus is\n\nbest construed to encompass only events that involve adverse rental housing market conditions. 8\n\n         Finally, the Rule’s localist phrasing and the interrelation of the Rule’s provisions, viewed\n\nholistically, show that HUD may justify a particular SAFMR designation’s suspension or PHA’s\n\nexemption only through a localized determination that conditions in a particular affected area or\n\n\n\n8\n         Johnson v. United States abrogated Begay by voiding the phrase “otherwise involves conduct that presents\na serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” known as § 922(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s “residual clause,” for vagueness.\n135 S. Ct. 2551, 2563 (2015). Begay nonetheless persuasively illustrates the ejusdem generis canon’s application.\n\n                                                          23\n\fPHA warrant such action. Section 888.113(c)(4)’s first sentence requires HUD to designate\n\nSAFMR areas each year, which “designations will be permanent.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\nElsewhere, the Rule identifies (1) five fixed, objective “criteria used to determine those\n\nmetropolitan areas” to receive designations and (2) precise, dynamic “selection values” for each\n\ncriterion. Id. § 888.113(c)(1) (identifying selection criteria); SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed.\n\nReg. at 80,679 (identifying selection values); see also infra Part III.A.2. Section 888.113(c)(4)’s\n\nsecond sentence allows HUD to suspend “a Small Area FMR designation from a metropolitan\n\narea” and to exempt “a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area” upon “a documented\n\ndetermination that such action is warranted.” Id. (emphasis added). Notably, this sentence does\n\nnot authorize HUD to suspend, in wholesale fashion, “all SAFMR designations” or exempt “all\n\naffected PHAs” in “all metropolitan areas.” This language, rather, focuses HUD’s inquiry on\n\nindividualized reasons for suspending a particular designation or exempting a particular PHA.\n\n        The third sentence cabins HUD’s discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt\n\na PHA, enumerating three “[a]ctions” that “may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area\n\nFMRs.” Id. 9 The first two actions—“A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the\n\nloss of a substantial number of housing units” and “A sudden influx of displaced households\n\nneeding permanent housing,” id. § 888.113(c)(4)(i)–(ii)—do not merely address free-floating\n\npolicy concerns. Each action, by nature, affects discrete, particular geographic areas. Thus, §\n\n888.113(c)(4), read as a whole and in concert with surrounding provisions, requires HUD to\n\njustify a particular SAFMR designation’s suspension or PHA’s exemption by reference to\n\nspecific rental housing market conditions local to the affected area. HUD may not, in other\n\n\n\n\n9\n       Notably, again, this sentence references “a suspension of [SA]FMRs.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4)\n(emphasis added).\n\n                                                      24\n\fwords, suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA by citing abstract policy concerns or\n\nconclusions extrapolated from data with no or only tenuous relation to the specific affected PHA.\n\n       The plaintiffs and defendants read § 888.113(c)(4) differently. The plaintiffs understand\n\nHUD’s authority to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA more narrowly, arguing\n\nthat the term “events” reaches only “unexpected events resulting in a sudden change in localized\n\nrental market conditions.” Pls.’ Mem. at 26. “Whether market conditions have ‘negative\n\nimpacts on voucher families,’” the plaintiffs argue, “has nothing to do with whether any area\n\nmeets regulatory criteria for small area designation or whether its FMRs remain reliable.” Pls.’\n\nReply Mem. Supp. Mot. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 9, ECF No. 25. Section 888.113(c)(4), however, by\n\nits plain terms authorizes HUD to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA even when\n\nthe conditions that triggered the SAFMR’s application to that metropolitan area or PHA still\n\napply, so long as a qualifying event occurs. HUD could have written § 888.113(c)(4) in terms\n\nthat would allow SAFMR suspensions or PHA exemptions only when a particular metropolitan\n\narea or PHA no longer satisfied the criteria for SAFMR designation in the first place, but HUD\n\ndid not so limit the suspension/exemption authority that the regulation conferred. Cf. Wallaesa,\n\n824 F.3d at 1083 (“If Congress had intended that narrow meaning, it knew how to say so.”).\n\nMoreover, to construe the term “events” to reach only adverse rental housing market condition\n\nchanges that are “sudden” and “unexpected” has no basis in the regulatory text, is neither\n\ncompelled by nor necessary to give effect to the two preceding actions, and would leave HUD\n\npowerless to suspend the Rule’s impact under circumstances that, though foreseen or gradual,\n\nnegatively impact voucher holders. Construing “events” to reach any “adverse rental housing\n\nmarket conditions,” in contrast, finds support in the preambulatory text, gives effect to the two\n\npreceding exemplar actions, and leaves HUD flexibility to suspend an SAFMR designation or\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\fexempt a particular PHA under circumstances that, although either foreseen or gradual,\n\nnonetheless negatively impact voucher holders.\n\n       The defendants, in turn, contend that § 888.113(c)(4) vests HUD with virtually boundless\n\nauthority to suspend SAFMR designations or exempt PHAs. The defendants specifically argue\n\nthat (1) the three enumerated actions merely illustrate, rather than exhaust, the sort of actions that\n\ntrigger HUD’s authority to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA, and (2) the third\n\naction gives HUD unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA\n\nfor essentially any reason. Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27. These arguments do not pass muster.\n\n       First, the defendants argue that § 888.113(c)(4) does not provide an exclusive list of\n\nactions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA, but merely\n\nnonexclusive examples of such actions. Defs.’ Opp’n at 23–24. This construction is inconsistent\n\nwith § 888.113(c)(4)’s phrasing, which provides, “Actions that may serve as the basis of a\n\nsuspension of Small Area FMRs are,” then lists three specific actions. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4)\n\n(emphasis added). Section 888.113(c)(4)’s use of the term “are” rather than “include” compels a\n\nconclusion that the enumerated examples constitute an exclusive, rather than merely illustrative,\n\nlist of actions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA. Had\n\nHUD wished to reserve to itself authority to suspend an SAFMR designation for reasons other\n\nthan an enumerated action’s occurrence, HUD could have drafted § 888.113(c)(4) to provide that\n\n“Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs include” the three\n\nenumerated actions. HUD, however, did not do that; by drafting § 888.113(c)(4) to contain the\n\nterm “are” rather than “include,” HUD limited its authority to suspend an SAFMR designation to\n\nthe occurrence of an enumerated action. Cf. Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at 1083.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f       Second, the defendants argue that even if HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or\n\nexempt a PHA only upon an enumerated action’s occurrence, the third action is phrased so\n\nbroadly as to give HUD essentially unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation\n\nor exempt a PHA for any reason. Defs.’ Opp’n at 22–26. The ejusdem generis canon, the\n\ndefendants say, is inapplicable because § 888.113(c)(4) contains no “general term which follows\n\nspecific ones.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 24 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is\n\nincorrect. Section 888.113(c)(4) enumerates two specific actions—“A Presidentially declared\n\ndisaster area that results in the loss of a substantial number of housing units” and “A sudden\n\ninflux of displaced needing permanent housing”—followed by a third, more general action—\n\n“Other events as determined by the Secretary.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\n       The defendants contend that the Rule’s overall context shows that ejusdem generis does\n\nnot apply, identifying three aspects of the Rule that the defendants characterize indicating “an\n\nintent to be expansive.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 24–25. Although “the ejusdem generis canon does not\n\ncontrol when the whole context dictates a different conclusion,” Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at 1081\n\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted), the defendants’ argument actually ignores the\n\nregulation’s pertinent context and precise language. The defendants observe that the regulation\n\nuses “self-contained, broadly permissive language.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 25. The ejusdem generis\n\ncanon applies, however, to language that otherwise reads broadly. See Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at\n\n1081. The defendants note that “the language introducing the enumerated examples contains no\n\nindication that those examples are meant to restrict the circumstances under which HUD may\n\nfind a suspension warranted.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 25. The ejusdem generis canon, however,\n\nrequires no clear statement that specific language limits general language’s scope. Indeed, to\n\nrequire such clarity would defeat the canon’s purpose of clarifying ambiguous statutes. Finally,\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fthe defendants observe that the third action’s wording “specifically states that the nature of the\n\nreferenced ‘events’ are those that are ‘determined by the Secretary,’ not those that are similar in\n\nkind to the preceding examples,” which the defendants argue “forecloses the notion that the\n\nnature of the ‘events’ referenced therein is to be limited by the preceding examples.” Id. That\n\nHUD has some discretion to determine which events justify suspending an SAFMR designation\n\nis undisputed, however; the question is whether that discretion is bounded. Here, the sequence of\n\ntwo specifically-phrased actions followed by a generally-phrased third action indicates that the\n\nfirst two actions limit HUD discretion under the third action. To construe the third action as\n\nreaching any event the first two actions do not reach would defeat the purpose of enumerating an\n\nexclusive list of “[a]ctions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs.” 24\n\nC.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\n       Nor would applying the ejusdem generis canon render the phrase “as determined by the\n\nSecretary” superfluous. This language, read in context, can be read to vest HUD with discretion\n\nto determine whether a qualifying event warrants an SAFMR designation’s suspension or a\n\nPHA’s exemption, such that HUD need not suspend a designation or exempt a PHA each time a\n\ndesignated area or PHA experiences a disaster. This language does not allow HUD to determine\n\nwhether something qualifies as an “event” in the first place. In other words, § 888.113(c)(4)(iii)\n\ngives HUD discretion, but cabins that discretion by allowing its exercise only upon a qualifying\n\n“event[’s]” occurrence. The defendants compare the phrase “other events as determined by the\n\nSecretary” to the language of 49 U.S.C. § 44702(d)(2), which authorizes the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration to “rescind a delegation . . . at any time for any reason the [agency] considers\n\nappropriate”—language the D.C. Circuit held “very clearly commits the renewal/nonrenewal\n\ndesignation to agency discretion.” Steenholdt v. FAA, 314 F.3d 633, 638 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The\n\n\n\n                                                 28\n\fphrase at issue here, however, is considerably narrower than § 44702(d)(2)’s language.\n\nSteeholdt, if anything, cuts against the defendants’ position by illustrating how an agency might\n\ndraft a rule that confers the boundless discretion HUD claims to possess.\n\n        Finally, the defendants invoke the Auer doctrine to argue that their construction of the\n\nregulation is due deference even if the regulation’s meaning is not clear. Defs.’ Opp’n at 25–26.\n\nAs explained in detail above, however, the defendants’ construction is “inconsistent with the\n\nregulation,” Press Commc’ns LLC, 875 F.3d at 1121, and thus due no deference. 10\n\n                 b)       HUD Failed to Identify Local Adverse Rental Housing Market Conditions\n\n        Whether HUD invoked a proper triggering “event” to justify delaying by two years the\n\nRule’s implementation thus turns on whether HUD based the Rule’s delay on an event involving\n\nlocal “adverse rental housing market conditions.” The Suspension Memorandum presents three\n\nrationales for delaying the Rule’s implementation: (1) the Interim Report’s findings showing the\n\nRule’s potentially negative impact on voucher holders; (2) comments received in response to the\n\nReducing Regulatory Burden notice; and (3) HUD’s failure timely to create SAFMR guidance\n\nand technical assistance for affected PHAs. Suspension Mem. at 5–8. The latter two rationales\n\nhave nothing to do with local rental housing market conditions in the 23 affected PHAs, and so\n\ncannot independently sustain HUD’s invocation of § 888.113(c)(4)’s third action. As to the\n\nRule’s potential adverse impact on voucher holders, the Suspension Memorandum identified\n\nevidence from the Interim Report, which evaluated the demonstration project’s preliminary\n\nfindings, that SAFMRs may decrease rental housing unit stock. Id. at 5–6. The demonstration\n\n\n10\n         A conclusion that 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) does not give HUD essentially boundless discretion to suspend\nan SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA for any reason, but rather provides meaningful standards by which a court\nmay evaluate the lawfulness of HUD’s actions, necessarily also defeats the defendants’ contention that HUD’s delay\nof the SAFMR Rule’s implementation is not reviewable. Defs.’ Opp’n at 19–21; see Cody v. Cox, 509 F.3d 606,\n610 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“[Re]but[ting] the presumption that agency action is judicially reviewable” requires a\ndefendant to show that “the relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against\nwhich to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                                       29\n\fproject’s 7 pilot PHAs and the 200+ Rule-affected PHAs essentially do not overlap, however,\n\nand HUD has identified no basis to conclude that any lessons on SAFMRs’ efficacy that can be\n\nextrapolated from the demonstration project findings apply to the Rule-affected PHAs, as\n\nmaterial differences in the pilot and Rule-affected PHAs’ relevant characteristics exist.               11\n\n\nIndeed, given that HUD selected the pilot and Rule-affected PHAs using entirely different\n\ncriteria to serve entirely different purposes, any assumption that the pilot PHAs represent the\n\nRule-affected PHAs, or vice versa, in relevant respects seems highly questionable. HUD thus\n\nhas failed to identify adverse rental housing market conditions local to the 23 Rule-affected\n\nareas, and so cannot invoke the authority that § 888.113(c)(4) gives the agency to suspend an\n\nSAFMR designation or exempt a PHA without notice and comment.\n\n        The Suspension Memorandum primarily relied on the Interim Report’s findings that\n\nSAFMR use caused a net loss of units available to voucher holders in the pilot PHAs. The\n\nInterim Report stated that although the pilot PHAs’ use of SAFMRs\n\n        should increase the pool of units potentially available . . . in high-rent FMRs, while\n        reducing the pool of units that are located in lower-rent ZIP codes . . . . the gain in\n        units with rents below the applicable FMR in high-rent ZIP codes did not offset the\n        decrease in the number of units in the low-rent and moderate-rent ZIP codes,\n        resulting in a net loss of units that are potentially available to voucher families.\n\nSuspension Mem. at 5; see Interim Report at vii. The Suspension Memorandum concluded that\n\n“[t]he net effect across the 7 study PHAs is a loss of over 22,000 units (3.4 percent) that might\n\notherwise have been affordable to voucher families.” Suspension Mem. at 5.\n\n\n\n11\n         The one PHA that the demonstration project and Rule both affected is the Housing Authority of Cook\nCounty, Illinois. Compare Demonstration Project, 77 Fed. Reg. at 69,652, with SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed.\nReg. at 80,679; see also Hr’g Tr. at 8. The Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201, judicially notices that\nCook County is in the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL HUD Metro FMR Area. See Chicago, ENCYCLOPAEDIA\nBRITANNICA, https://www.britannica.com/place/Chicago (last visited Dec. 23, 2017) (describing Chicago as the\n“seat of Cook county”); Cook County Map Application, COOK CTY.

For example, in at least\n\none significant way, the Long Beach pilot PHA did not demographically represent the Rule-\n\naffected PHAs. Long Beach’s high-rent ZIP codes contained only 11 percent of the PHA’s\n\nrental housing units, a lower figure than for any other pilot PHA. Interim Report at 28 & tbl. 4-\n\n1. By contrast, high-rent ZIP codes in each Rule-affected area must, according to the selection\n\ncriteria, contain at least 20 percent of the area’s total rental housing unit supply. See SAFMR\n\nArea Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679; 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(1). 12 This contrast is\n\nsignificant because SAFMRs increase rental unit affordability in high-rent ZIP codes and\n\ndecrease rental unit affordability in low-rent ZIP codes, and thus reduce overall rental housing\n\nunit supply more dramatically in areas like Long Beach, which have relatively few high-rent\n\nunits, than areas with more high-rent units. Interim Report at 32–34. “[I]f fewer rental units . . .\n\nare in high-rent ZIP Codes than in low-rent ZIP Codes . . . then the shift to SAFMRs will mean\n\nfewer units” available. Id. at 34.\n\n        Long Beach, though only one of the seven pilot PHAs, distorted the demonstration\n\nproject’s findings because much of the net decrease in rental housing unit supply that the project\n\nattributed to SAFMRs occurred in Long Beach. The Interim Report found that decreases in\n\nrental housing unit supply largely were concentrated in Long Beach, which saw a greater than 10\n\n\n\n\n12\n         The Interim Report defined a high-rent ZIP code as a zip code with a “rent ratio”—the ratio of a two-\nbedroom SAFMR over a two-bedroom metropolitan area FMR—of greater than 1.1, and a low-rent ZIP code as a\nzip code with a rent ratio of below 0.9. Interim Report at 27.\n\n                                                       31\n\fpercent net loss of rental housing unit supply. Id. at vii. 13 By contrast, two pilot PHAs—Laredo\n\nand Mamaroneck—saw “virtually no change in the overall number of units” available after\n\nimplementing SAFMRs whatsoever. Id. at 33 & tbl. 4-5. Long Beach, an area demographically\n\nunrepresentative of the Rule-affected areas, thus skewed the demonstration project’s findings.\n\n        The pilot PHAs also did not represent Rule-affected areas with respect to the SAFMR\n\nmandate’s geographic scope within a metropolitan area. Only two of the seven pilot PHAs—\n\nLaredo and Mamaroneck—mandated SAFMR use throughout the entire metropolitan area. Id. at\n\n33. Laredo and Mamaroneck were “unique among the SAFMR PHAs in that their jurisdictions\n\nare the same as the geographies for which their respective FMRs are calculated.” Id. Laredo and\n\nMamaroneck, in other words, were the only PHAs in their respective metropolitan areas, and, as\n\nsuch, implementation of SAFMRs applied across those two PHAs’ entire metropolitan areas.\n\nFive of the seven pilot PHAs, however, did not make PHA use mandatory across an entire\n\nmetropolitan area. Id. In contrast, all PHAs within each metropolitan area that the Rule affects\n\nuse SAFMRs. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(3); Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,568. An SAFMR’s\n\ngeographic scope within a metropolitan area matters because “[i]f only a few agencies within a\n\nmetropolitan area use Small Area FMRs, voucher holders may have difficulty moving to high-\n\nopportunity neighborhoods outside those agencies’ jurisdiction.” CBPP Decl. ¶ 7. “For\n\nexample, if an urban agency adopts Small Area FMRs but the surrounding suburbs do not, then\n\nfamilies will face the same cost hurdles that currently prevent them from moving to lower-\n\npoverty, suburban neighborhoods.” Id. Indeed, HUD itself acknowledged this conclusion during\n\nboth the demonstration project and the rulemaking period. See NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,224;\n\nProposed Demonstration Project, 75 Fed. Reg. at 27,811. When PHAs in low-rent ZIP codes,\n\n\n13\n       The Dallas pilot PHA also saw a large decrease in number of rental housing units lost, but this loss\namounted to only 4% of the Dallas pilot PHA’s total rental housing unit supply. Interim Report at vii.\n\n                                                        32\n\fbut not PHAs in high-rent ZIP codes, adopt SAFMRs, voucher holders will face rising rents in\n\nlow-income areas but no commensurate decrease in rents in high-rent ZIP codes. SAFMRs’\n\nsuccess thus requires all PHAs within a metropolitan area to adopt SAFMRs. Laredo and\n\nMamaroneck, the only two pilot PHAs that implemented SAFMRs throughout their entire\n\nmetropolitan areas, significantly were the only pilot PHAs that saw virtually no decrease in\n\nrental housing unit supply. Interim Report at 33. The lack of any metropolitan area-wide\n\nSAFMR mandate in five of seven pilot PHAs’ respective metropolitan areas raises yet another\n\nquestion about the demonstration project findings’ applicability to the Rule-affected areas, which\n\nmandate SAFMR use throughout their entire metropolitan areas.\n\n       That the pilot PHAs were not representative of Rule-affected PHAs is unsurprising, as\n\nHUD used entirely different criteria to select these two groups. HUD used five fixed, objective\n\n“selection criteria” to determine which PHAs the Rule would cover: the (1) “number of vouchers\n\nunder lease in the metropolitan FMR area;” (2) “percentage of the standard quality rental stock,\n\nwithin the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small Area FMR is\n\nmore than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR area;” (3) “percentage of voucher families living\n\nin concentrated low income areas;” (4) “percentage of voucher families living in concentrated\n\nlow income areas relative to the percentage of all renters within these areas over the entire\n\nmetropolitan area;” and (5) “vacancy rate for the metropolitan area.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(1).\n\nHUD also, by notice published in the Federal Register, identified objective “selection values” for\n\neach criterion “to determine . . . metropolitan FMR areas subject to Small Area FMRs”: (1)\n\n“[t]here are at least 2,500 HCV under lease;” (2) “[a]t least 20 percent of the standard quality\n\nrental stock, within the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small\n\nArea FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR;” (3) “[t]he percentage of voucher\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\ffamilies living in concentrated low income areas relative to all renters within the area must be at\n\nleast 25 percent;” (4) “[t]he measure of the percentage of voucher holders living in concentrated\n\nlow income areas relative to all renters within these areas over the entire metropolitan area\n\nexceeds 155 percent;” and (5) “[t]he vacancy rate for the metropolitan area is higher than 4\n\npercent.” SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679. 14\n\n        Entirely different criteria guided the pilot PHAs’ selection. HUD first constructed a pool\n\nof PHAs that met seven initial criteria, which were entirely different than the criteria HUD used\n\nto determine the Rule’s coverage. HUD included in the initial pool each PHA that: (1) “[h]ad at\n\nleast 500 vouchers in use as of September 30, 2011;” (2) “[h]ad at least 10 housing choice\n\nvoucher (HCV) tenants living in ZIP Codes where the SAFMR exceeded the metropolitan area\n\nFair Market Rent (FMR) by more than 10 percent in fiscal year 2012;” (3) “[h]ad at least 10\n\nHCV tenants living in ZIP Codes where the SAFMR was more than 10 percent less than the\n\nmetropolitan area FMR;” (4) “[h]ad attained at least 95 percent HCV family reporting in Public\n\nand Indian Housing Information Center;” (5) “[w]as not troubled, as determined by the Section 8\n\nManagement Assessment Program;” (6) “[h]ad the administrative capacity to carry out the\n\nSAFMR program;” and (7) “[h]ad not been involved in litigation that would seriously impede its\n\nability to administer the HCV program.” Demonstration Project, 77 Fed. Reg. at 69,652. These\n\ncriteria produced a pool of 247 eligible PHAs, which HUD organized into eight selection clusters\n\nbased on each PHA’s (1) number of vouchers (small or large), (2) metropolitan area two-\n\nbedroom FMR (low or high), and (3) number of working-age heads of household (low or high\n\n\n\n\n14\n         With respect to the fifth criterion, HUD defined a metropolitan area’s vacancy rate as “the number of\nVacant For Rent Units divided by the sum of the number of Vacant For Rent Units, the number of Renter Occupied\nUnits, and the number of Rented, not occupied units.” SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679. HUD\ncalculated the vacancy rate “using data from the 1-year American Community Survey (ACS) tabulations” by\naveraging values “from the 3 most current ACS 1 year datasets available.” Id.\n\n                                                     34\n\fpercentage). Interim Report at 99 & tbl. A-1. HUD then randomly ordered PHAs within each\n\ncluster, and invited the PHA at the top of each cluster to participate in the demonstration project.\n\nId. at 100. When a PHA declined to participate, HUD invited a cluster’s next ranking PHA. Id.\n\nAfter several rounds of invitations, five PHAs had agreed to participate in the demonstration\n\nproject. Id. Finally, HUD included in the project two PHAs from the Dallas metropolitan area,\n\nwhich have used SAFMRs since 2011 pursuant to a settlement agreement. Id. at 3.\n\n       HUD’s decision to use different selection criteria for the pilot PHAs and Rule-affected\n\nareas reflects the different purposes HUD intended the demonstration project and Rule to serve.\n\nHUD “randomly selected five PHAs for the demonstration that differed across various\n\ncharacteristics” because HUD sought “[t]o test how SAFMRs may potentially affect a range of\n\nPHA types.” Interim Report at 2. In promulgating the Rule, however, HUD specifically targeted\n\n“those metropolitan areas . . . where establishing FMRs by ZIP code areas has the potential to\n\nsignificantly increase opportunities for voucher families.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,568.\n\nHUD’s different objectives in undertaking the demonstration project and promulgating the Rule\n\nfurther illustrate the inadequacy of HUD’s reliance on the demonstration project’s preliminary\n\nfindings to justify the Rule’s delay.\n\n       Finally, HUD’s incorporation into the Rule of various provisions designed to protect\n\nagainst the very concerns that the demonstration project identified further undermines HUD’s\n\nreliance on demonstration project data to delay the Rule. Most significantly, as discussed above,\n\nthe Rule requires all PHAs within an affected metropolitan area to use SAFMRs, addressing a\n\ncrucial issue that the demonstration project uncovered. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(3); Final Rule, 81\n\nFed. Reg. at 80,568. The Rule also contains several other provisions to protect voucher holders\n\nagainst issues the demonstration project revealed, including (1) “limit[ing] the annual decrease in\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fSmall Area FMRs to no more than 10 percent of the area’s FMR in the prior fiscal year” and\n\nallowing PHAs to (2) “hold harmless those families remaining in place from payment standard\n\nreductions,” (3) “establish a new payment standard for families under HAP contract between the\n\nfull ‘hold harmless’ option . . . and the new payment standard based on the Small Area FMR,”\n\n(4) “establish different policies regarding how decreases in payment standards will apply [to\n\nvoucher holders] for designated areas within their jurisdiction,” and (5) “request and receive\n\napproval to establish an exception payment standard promptly for a ZIP Code area if necessary\n\nto react to rapidly changing market conditions or to ensure sufficient rental units are available for\n\nvoucher families.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,572–74. HUD has discounted the importance\n\nof two of these five enumerated voucher holder protections incorporated into the Rule, noting\n\nthat the 10 percent SAFMR cap “may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as opposed to\n\npreventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families,” and that the\n\n“hold harmless” provision does not “protect[] families that must move to a new unit or []\n\napplicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the first\n\ntime.” Suspension Mem. at 5–7. HUD seemingly has not, however, considered or addressed the\n\nRule’s other voucher holder protection provisions. 15\n\n        In sum, the significant differences between the (1) pilot and Rule-affected PHAs, (2)\n\nselection criteria HUD used to identify each group, and (3) purposes HUD sought the\n\ndemonstration project and Rule to achieve impose on HUD a burden to show that any\n\nconclusions the Interim Report extrapolated from the demonstration project’s findings apply to\n\n\n\n15\n         As the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, which filed a brief as amicus\ncuriae in support of plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, observe, various provisions of the Rule are\n“expressly designed to limit Rule-related increases in tenants’ rent burdens . . . . [b]ut HUD makes no mention of\nthese differences between the demonstration project and the Small Area Rule, even as it relies on the Interim\nEvaluation of the demonstration projects as a justification for suspending implementation of the Rule.” Amicus Br.\nat 8, ECF No. 21.\n\n                                                       36\n\fthe specific Rule-affected areas. Neither the Suspension Memo nor Letter to PHAs, however,\n\neven attempt to make such a showing. Nor, for that matter, does the defendants’ briefing. The\n\nplaintiffs thus have established likely success on the merits of their notice and comment claim.\n\n       2. HUD’s Delay of the Rule’s Implementation Was Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n       The plaintiffs also argue that HUD’s delay of the Rule’s implementation was arbitrary\n\nand capricious. Pls.’ Mem at 28–34. According to the plaintiffs, HUD failed adequately to\n\nexplain its reasons for delaying the Rule’s implementation. Id. at 28. As explained above, §\n\n888.113(c)(4) required HUD to identify adverse rental housing market conditions local to a\n\nparticular area or PHA to justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA in that\n\narea. HUD, as explained, did no such thing. Instead, HUD attempted to justify delaying the\n\nRule’s implementation by two years by citing data based on a small number of pilot PHAs,\n\nwhich did not represent the Rule-affected areas in terms of demographics or scope and which\n\nHUD selected partially randomly (1) on the basis of entirely different criteria than those HUD\n\nused to select the Rule-affected areas and (2) for entirely different objectives than HUD sought\n\nto achieve through the Rule’s promulgation. HUD, in so doing, “relied on factors”—i.e., the\n\ndemonstration project data—“which [law] ha[d] not intended it to consider” and “entirely failed\n\nto consider an important aspect of the problem”—i.e., local rental housing market conditions in\n\nthe Rule-affected areas. Mayo, 875 F.3d at 19 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (alterations\n\nomitted)). HUD’s two-year delay of the Rule’s implementation therefore was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious. As such, the plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits as to\n\ntheir arbitrary and capricious claim, for essentially the same reasons they have shown likely\n\nsuccess on the merits as to their notice and comment claim.\n\n       B.      Risk of Irreparable Harm\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f       The plaintiffs argue that they will suffer irreparable harm if HUD does not implement the\n\nRule by January 1, 2018. “The party seeking a preliminary injunction must make two showings\n\nto demonstrate irreparable harm.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 7. “First, the harm\n\nmust be ‘certain and great,’ ‘actual and not theoretical,’ and so ‘imminent that there is a clear and\n\npresent need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.’” Id. at 7–8 (quoting Chaplaincy of\n\nFull Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (alterations omitted)).\n\n“Second, the harm ‘must be beyond remediation.’” Id. at 8 (quoting Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at\n\n297). Here, plaintiffs Crystal Carter, Tiana Moore, and OCA each have made a requisite\n\nshowing of irreparable harm from the Rule’s delay.\n\n       1.      Crystal Carter\n\n       Plaintiff Crystal Carter has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to warrant\n\na preliminary injunction. Ms. Carter and her five minor children currently use a Housing Choice\n\nVoucher to rent a four-bedroom house in the City of Hartford, Connecticut. Carter Decl. ¶ 1.\n\nThree of Ms. Carter’s children attend high-performing schools in the Simsbury School District\n\nthrough Hartford’s Open Choice school integration program. Id. ¶ 4. Ms. Carter wishes to use\n\nher voucher to move to the town of Simsbury in Hartford County, Connecticut, to be closer to\n\nthose schools. Id. ¶ 6. Simsbury’s poverty rate of 3.4 percent, Decl. of Sasha Samberg-\n\nChampion (“Pls.’ Decl.”), Ex. I, Poverty Data for Simsbury Town, CT, ECF No. 16-9, is much\n\nlower than the poverty rate in Ms. Carter’s ZIP code, which is 32.2 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. G,\n\nPoverty Data for 06114 ZIP Code, ECF No 16-7. Simsbury offers higher quality education and a\n\nsafer living environment for Ms. Carter’s entire family than does Hartford. Carter Decl. ¶ 6. As\n\nthe plaintiffs observe, “[l]iving close to her children’s schools has obvious benefits for any\n\nparent, including reducing the children’s commute times, giving them more opportunity to\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fengage with their classmates out of school, and allowing the parent to be more involved with her\n\nchildren’s schools.” Pls.’ Mem. at 39.\n\n        The Rule’s implementation would enable Ms. Carter to move her family from Hartford to\n\nSimsbury; the Rule’s suspension deprives her of the Rule’s benefits. If the Rule goes into effect,\n\nthe FMR for a four-bedroom unit in much of Simsbury will be $1,940 per month for Fiscal Year\n\n2018. See Pls.’ Decl., Ex. F, 2018 Hartford SAFMRs at 2, ECF No. 16-6. 16 Should the Rule’s\n\nimplementation remain delayed, however, the FMR for a four-bedroom dwelling in Simsbury\n\nwill be $1,620 per month, see Pls.’ Decl., Ex. E, 2018 Hartford FMRs at 5, ECF No. 16-5—an\n\namount that Ms. Carter’s experience shows to be insufficient to find an appropriate in Simsbury.\n\nCarter Decl. ¶ 7. The fact that Ms. Carter’s PHA may implement SAFMRs voluntarily, see\n\nSuspension Mem. at 3; Letter to PHAs at 3, does not prevent Ms. Carter from showing\n\nirreparable harm. For the reasons explained above, SAFMRs fail to assist voucher holders to\n\nrelocate to high-opportunity areas unless all or substantially all PHAs within a metropolitan area\n\nimplement SAFMRs, meaning that a single PHA, such as Ms. Carter’s, likely will not implement\n\nSAFMRs voluntarily. Further, HUD’s counsel conceded at oral argument that no Rule-affected\n\nPHA has come forward to opt into the Rule voluntarily, Hr’g Tr. at 18–19, which likewise\n\nillustrates the unlikeliness that Ms. Carter’s PHA will implement SAFMRs voluntarily.\n\n        The defendants correctly observe that Ms. Carter’s children already attend school in\n\nSimsbury, Defs.’ Opp’n at 34, but do not dispute that Ms. Carter would enjoy the obvious\n\nbenefits of “be[ing] closer to [her] children’s schools” and “liv[ing] in a safer and healthier\n\nneighborhood environment for [her] children” if she lived in Simsbury. Carter Decl. ¶ 6. The\n\n\n\n16\n         The Court, relying on the United States Postal Service’s “Look Up A ZIP Code” tool, see Look Up A Zip\nCodeTM, U.S. POSTAL SERV., https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action?mode=2&refresh=true (last\nvisited Dec. 23, 2017), takes judicial notice that the ZIP Code for much of Simsbury is 06070. FED. R. EVID. 201.\n\n                                                        39\n\fdefendants argue that “the mere possibility . . . that [Ms. Carter’s] school-age children may\n\npotentially earn a higher income in their mid-twenties if they move at some point to a lower-\n\npoverty area is entirely speculative and in no way imminent.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 34. The\n\nplaintiffs, however, identify “robust evidence that children who moved to lower-poverty areas\n\nwhen they were young (below age 13) are more likely to attend college,” to “have substantially\n\nhigher incomes as adults,” and to “live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults,” and are\n\n“less likely to become single parents.” Raj Chetty et al., The Effects of Exposure to Better\n\nNeighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment, 106\n\nAM . ECON. REV. 855, 899 (2016); see also LORA ENGDAHL, P OVERTY & RACE RES. ACTION\n\nCOUNCIL, NEW NEIGHBORHOODS, NEW SCHOOLS: A P ROGRESS REPORT ON THE BALTIM ORE\n\nHOUSING MOBILITY P ROGRAM 27–28 (2009) (finding that relocation to low-poverty areas\n\nproduces significant mental health benefits to Housing Choice Voucher holders); MARGERY\n\nAUSTIN TURNER & LYNETTE RAWLINGS, URBAN INST ., P ROM OTING NEIGHBORHOOD DIVERSITY:\n\nBENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND STRATEGIES 2 (2009) (describing the myriad ways “[n]eighborhoods\n\nmatter to the well-being of children and families.”). The weight of this research certainly\n\nindicates that Ms. Carter’s family may enjoy some additional benefits from living in Simsbury.\n\n       The defendants also argue that Ms. Carter has not “identified any imminent risk that she\n\nor her family will actually be subject to criminal activity in Hartford.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 34. This\n\narguments set the bar too high. “[A]s a preliminary injunction requires only a likelihood of\n\nirreparable injury, . . . Damocles’s sword does not have to actually fall . . . before the court will\n\nissue an injunction.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8–9. Irreparable harm can flow not\n\nonly from actual criminal victimization, but also from “continued exposure to [a] high crime rate\n\n. . . and unsafe conditions of [one’s] present community.” Bronson v. Crestwood Lake Section 1\n\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fHolding Corp., 724 F. Supp. 148, 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); see also ENGDAHL, supra, at 27\n\n(“Families in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at higher risk for disease and earlier death likely\n\ndue” in part to “the cumulative stress arising from living in unsafe neighborhoods with limited\n\nresources.”); TURNER & RAWLINGS, supra, at 3 (“Young people who live in high-crime areas are\n\nmore likely to commit crimes themselves.”).\n\n       The defendants observe that Ms. Carter has not “alleged that she has applied for housing\n\nin Simsbury, that if she did apply she would be likely to be selected despite competition from\n\nother applicants, or that there are sufficient landlords in Simsbury participating in the HCV\n\nprogram and accepting voucher-holding tenants including, in particular, her.” Defs.’ Opp’n at\n\n34. To apply for housing in Simsbury prior to the Rule’s implementation, however, would be\n\nfutile—the Rule’s premise is that voucher holders such as Ms. Carter cannot obtain housing in\n\nhigh-income areas like Simsbury because current payment standards do not suffice to make such\n\nhousing affordable. Ms. Carter has established that she intends to apply for and obtain such\n\nhousing as soon as she possibly can. Carter Decl. ¶¶ 6–7. A landlord’s discrimination against\n\nvoucher holders, moreover, would violate Connecticut law. See Con. Gen. Stat. § 46a-64c;\n\nComm’n on Human Rights & Opportunities v. Sullivan Assocs., 739 A.2d 238, 241 (Conn.\n\n1999). Furthermore, HUD’s own calculation, based on detailed housing market data, that an\n\nFMR of $1,940 will suffice to allow a voucher holder to rent a four-bedroom unit in Simsbury\n\nbelies HUD’s speculative assertion that such units may be unavailable to Ms. Carter even under\n\nthe Rule, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 34.\n\n       Finally, the defendants dispute that any expenses associated with Ms. Carter’s longer\n\ncommute would be sufficiently burdensome to warrant injunctive relief. Id. This argument\n\nmischaracterizes the nature of the harm that Ms. Carter’s family would suffer from her commute.\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\fThe relevant harm is not primarily an economic injury, but “the opportunity cost of spending\n\nhours on a bus instead of participating in after school activities, studying, and engaging in active\n\nplay.” Pls.’ Reply at 21.\n\n       2. Tiara Moore\n\n       Plaintiff Tiara Moore likewise has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to\n\nwarrant a preliminary injunction. Ms. Moore and her minor child live in an apartment in the City\n\nof Chicago, Illinois. Moore Decl. ¶ 1. The Chicago Housing Authority has issued Ms. Moore a\n\nHousing Choice Voucher for $1,207 per month for a two-bedroom unit. Id. ¶¶ 4, 7. Ms. Moore\n\nwishes to move to DuPage County, Illinois, to live in a neighborhood that will afford her family\n\ngreater employment opportunities, higher quality education, and a safer living environment, as\n\nwell as to be nearer to Ms. Moore’s mother, who provides child care so that Ms. Moore can\n\nwork. Id. ¶¶ 5–6. DuPage County’s poverty rate of 7.4 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. J, Poverty Data\n\nfor DuPage County, Ill., ECF No. 16-10, is also much lower than the poverty rate in Ms.\n\nMoore’s ZIP code, which is 33.8 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. H, Poverty Data for 60644 ZIP Code,\n\nECF No 16-8. Ms. Moore has not, however, been able to locate any two-bedroom rental units in\n\nDuPage County for $1,207 per month. Id. ¶ 7. The Rule would enable Ms. Moore to move her\n\nfamily from the City of Chicago to DuPage County. For fiscal year 2018, the FMR for a two-\n\nbedroom unit in the broad Chicago metropolitan area, which includes DuPage County, would be\n\n$1,180 per month. Pls.’ Decl., Ex. C, Chicago FMRs at 1, ECF No. 16-3. In contrast, under the\n\nRule, 41 of DuPage County’s ZIP codes would have SAFMRs exceeding $1,180 per month, with\n\nSAFMRs in the highest-cost ZIP codes reaching $1,770 per month. Pls.’ Decl., Ex. D, 2018\n\nChicago SAFMRs, ECF No. 16-4. This difference in voucher purchasing power throughout\n\nmuch of DuPage County would dramatically improve Ms. Moore’s ability to find suitable\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fhousing there. In addition, Ms. Moore will, absent the Rule’s implementation, continue to incur\n\nopportunity and transportation costs arising from her daily trips to bring her child to and from her\n\nmother’s house for child care. Moore Decl. ¶ 6.\n\n        The defendants argue that Ms. Moore will suffer no injury from the Rule’s delay, as the\n\nRule would not benefit her in the first place. Defs.’ Opp’n at 35. The defendants observe that\n\nthe Chicago Housing Authority is a Moving to Work PHA and so would be exempt from use of\n\nSAFMRs even if the Rule were implemented. See id., Attach. 3, Decl. of Marianne Nazzaro ¶¶\n\n2–3, ECF No. 24-3; Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,578. Ms. Moore, however, seeks to move to\n\nDuPage County, not to Chicago. Moore Decl. ¶¶ 5–6, 9. The DuPage County PHA, not the\n\nChicago Housing Authority, sets payment standards for DuPage County, see 24 C.F.R. §\n\n982.503(a)(1) (providing that PHAs set payment standards for their own jurisdictions), and,\n\nunlike the Chicago Housing Authority, is not a Moving to Work PHA, see Moving to Work\n\n(MTW) - Participating Sites, U.S. DEP’T HOUSING & URBAN DEV.,\n\nhttps://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/mtw/mtwsites (last\n\nvisited Dec. 23, 2017). The Rule’s implementation thus would benefit Ms. Moore. 17\n\n        3. OCA\n\n        Finally, Plaintiff OCA has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to warrant a\n\npreliminary injunction. An organization, to show irreparable harm, must show first that “the\n\n‘actions taken by the defendant have perceptibly impaired the organization’s programs.” League\n\nof Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8 (quoting Fair Emp’t Council of Greater Wash., Inc. v.

Defs.’ Opp’n at 34–35. The defendants’ arguments fail as to Ms. Moore for the same reason\nthey fail as to Ms. Carter.\n\n                                                        43\n\fthat the defendant’s actions ‘directly conflict with the organization’s mission.” Id.

Much of this work involves enabling families who receive housing vouchers\n\nto move to higher-opportunity areas and addressing the concentration of voucher holders (who,\n\nin the Hartford area, primarily are nonwhite) in high-poverty, segregated areas. Id. ¶¶ 4–9. For\n\nexample, OCA works to improve housing mobility programs for voucher users and to increase\n\nthe supply of rental housing suitable for voucher holders in high-opportunity neighborhoods. Id.\n\n       OCA has shown that the Rule’s delay will “perceptibly impair[]” OCA’s programs and\n\n“directly conflict with the organization’s mission.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8. The\n\nRule’s delay frustrates OCA’s ability to assist voucher holders gain access to greater opportunity\n\nin several ways. First, the delay frustrates OCA’s “engage[ment] with . . . developers to\n\nencourage the acquisition and construction of housing that is affordable to voucher holders in\n\nnon-concentrated, high-opportunity areas in the Hartford metropolitan area,” because “[t]he\n\nanticipated income from voucher holders will not support financing of such development while\n\n[voucher] rents are being calculated on a metropolitan-wide basis, rather than with a small-area\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\fcalculation.” OCA Decl. ¶ 8. OCA also has diverted scarce resources away from previously\n\nplanned projects to address HUD’s delay of the Rule. Id. ¶¶ 10–12. “With the suspension in\n\neffect,” OCA explains, “OCA will need to spend significant resources on research, outreach,\n\npublic education, and advocacy to implement small area market rents ‘voluntarily’ on a PHA-by-\n\nPHA basis across the Hartford metropolitan area, a multi-year effort that may ultimately prove\n\nfutile.” Id. ¶ 10. OCA has already changed its activities as a result of the Rule’s delay. For\n\nexample, OCA “planned to produce a Small Area Fair Market Rent web portal which would\n\nhave included (a) an analysis of the difference between SAFMRs and FMRs across the state, (b)\n\nan explanation of SAFMRs, (c) data on the current location of voucher holders, and (d) the\n\nresults of a time consuming rent study that highlighted the additional units that would become\n\navailable under the new rent calculation formula.” Id. ¶ 11. In light of the Rule’s delay, OCA is\n\n“now taking steps to revise the content of this portal and to instead produce an advocacy piece,\n\nbased on this data, explaining why the program freeze is detrimental.” Id. Finally, the Rule’s\n\ndelay has required OCA “to engage in further meetings and other communications with\n\nstakeholders to ensure that the impact of this policy suspension is fully understood” and to\n\n“spen[d] time conducting outreach to [OCA’s] coalition members to explain the freeze and its\n\nconsequences for voucher holders.” Id. ¶ 12.\n\n       The defendants assert that plaintiffs must show that OCA’s claimed monetary loss\n\n“threatens the very existence of the movant’s business” to support OCA’s claims of irreparable\n\neconomic injury. Defs.’ Opp’n at 36 (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1985)). The defendants misread the authority on which they rely. Wisconsin Gas Co. held\n\nthat “[r]ecoverable monetary loss may constitute irreparable harm only where the loss threatens\n\nthe very existence of the movant’s business.” 758 F.2d at 674. OCA’s monetary losses,\n\n\n\n                                                45\n\fhowever, are not recoverable, as the APA provides no damages remedy. See 5 U.S.C. § 702\n\n(authorizing actions “seeking relief other than money damages”). Wisconsin Gas Go. thus is\n\ninapposite; to show irreparable harm, OCA need only show that HUD’s delay of the Rule will\n\n“perceptibly impair[]” OCA’s programs and “directly conflict with the organization’s mission.”\n\nLeague of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8. For the reasons given, OCA has made such a showing.\n\n       C.      Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n\n       The third and fourth factors that courts consider in determining whether a preliminary\n\ninjunction is warranted are “a balance of the equities in [the plaintiffs’] favor, and accord with\n\nthe public interest.” Id. at 6 (quoting Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d at 505). The\n\nharm the plaintiffs would suffer from the Rule’s delay is clear, for the reasons explained above.\n\nAs HUD’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, moreover, the Rule’s delay would leave in\n\nplace the 50th Percentile Rule, which the defendants recognize has failed to serve Section 8’s\n\ngoals. Hr’g Tr. at 17. The harms the defendants assert that voucher holders would suffer should\n\nHUD implement the Rule on schedule, in contrast, are wholly speculative because they presume\n\nthe Interim Report’s findings apply to Rule-affected areas, which, also for reasons explained\n\nearlier, the defendants have failed to show. The defendants, moreover, “cannot suffer harm from\n\nan injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127,\n\n1145 (9th Cir. 2013); accord R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (same).\n\nThe balance of equities thus weighs in the plaintiffs’ favor. A preliminary injunction’s issuance\n\nalso would serve the public interest. “There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of\n\nunlawful agency action.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 12. “To the contrary, there is a\n\nsubstantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws”—such as\n\nthe APA, as well as regulations such as § 888.113(c)(4)—“that govern their existence and\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\foperations.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Gulf Coast Mar. Supply, Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 218 F. Supp. 3d 92, 101 (D.D.C. 2016), aff’d, 867 F.3d 123 (D.C. Cir. 2017)\n\n(“The public interest is served both by ensuring that government agencies conform to the\n\nrequirements of the APA.”). As such, the plaintiffs have met their burdens to show that the\n\nbalance of equities and consideration of the public interest support the injunctive relief they seek.\n\nIV.

This case is not about what is good housing policy, however.\n\nThis case is about the rule of law—whether an agency effectively may suspend a duly\n\npromulgated regulation without observing the procedures or identifying relevant factual criteria\n\nthat the law requires to effect such a change. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment (“HUD”), without notice and comment or particularized evidentiary findings, has\n\ndelayed almost entirely by two years implementation of a rule requiring over 200 local Public\n\nHousing Authorities (“PHAs”) in 24 metropolitan areas, which HUD selected based on fixed,\n\nobjective criteria, to calculate housing vouchers’ values based on local, rather than metropolitan-\n\nwide, prevailing market rents. The plaintiffs, two voucher holders and a nonprofit organization\n\ndevoted to providing housing opportunities for low-income people in Connecticut, move to\n\npreliminarily enjoin HUD to implement the rule on January 1, 2018, the rule’s effective date.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fPls.’ Mot. Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 15 (“Pls.’ Mot.”). For reasons this Memorandum\n\nOpinion explains in detail, the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is granted.\n\nI.       FACTS\n\n         A.        Overview of the Housing Choice Voucher Program and Fair Market Rents\n\n         Congress enacted the Housing Act of 1937 to assist state and local governments “to\n\nremedy unsafe and insanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of decent, safe, and\n\nsanitary dwellings for families of low income.” Pub. L. No. 75-412, § 1, 50 Stat. 888, 888\n\n(1937) (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437(a)). The Housing and Community Development Act of\n\n1974, enacted nearly 40 years later, amended the Housing Act to add Section 8, which authorized\n\nHUD to contract with PHAs to pay landlords rental subsidies on low-income tenants’ behalf.\n\nPub. L. No. 93-383, § 8(a), 88 Stat. 633, 662 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a)). The Housing\n\nand Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983, Pub. L. No. 98-181, § 207, 97 Stat. 1153, 1181 (codified\n\nas amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)), created the Housing Choice Voucher (“HCV”) program,\n\nwhich is HUD’s “major program for assisting very low-income families, the elderly, and the\n\ndisabled to afford decent, safe, and sanitary housing in the private market.” Housing Choice\n\nVouchers Fact Sheet, U.S. DEP’T HOUSING & URB. DEV.,\n\nhttps://www.hud.gov/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8 (last visited Dec. 23,\n\n2017) (“HCV Fact Sheet”). 1 HUD oversees the HCV program, directing funds to PHAs to\n\nadminister the program locally by issuing vouchers to qualified individuals and families, who use\n\nthose vouchers to secure housing in the private rental market. Id. A voucher holder may use a\n\nvoucher toward any housing that meets the HCV program’s requirements, subject to a PHA’s\n\n\n1\n        Federal Rule of Evidence 201 allows a court to take judicial notice of “a fact that is not subject to\nreasonable dispute because it . . . is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or . . . can be\naccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” FED. R. EVID.\n201(b). Both of these conditions apply to a description of the HCV program found on HUD’s public website.\n\n                                                             2\n\fapproval. 24 C.F.R. § 982.1(a)(2). HCV participation is limited to low-income households,\n\nwhich typically cannot afford to rent dwellings for which the rent substantially exceeds the HCV\n\nprogram payment standard. See HCV Fact Sheet, supra; see, e.g., Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 9, Decl. of\n\nTiara Moore (“Moore Decl.”) ¶¶ 3, 7, ECF No. 15-9.\n\n       A voucher’s value is calculated largely on the basis of HUD’s determination of the “fair-\n\nmarket rent” (“FMR”) for a dwelling of a particular size and type (e.g., a two-bedroom home).\n\n24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1). An FMR represents the amount required “to rent standard quality\n\nhousing throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in competition,”\n\nincluding “the cost of utilities, except telephone.” Id. § 888.113(a). HUD annually calculates\n\nand publishes in the Federal Register FMRs for different types of units in each market area as\n\nwell as any proposed changes to FMR calculation procedures. 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(1)(B); see\n\nalso 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1). PHAs, in turn, use FMR calculations to establish “payment\n\nstandard amounts” for each unit type. 24 C.F.R. § 982.503(a)(1).\n\n       A PHA generally sets a payment standard “between 90 percent and 110 percent of the\n\npublished FMR for that unit size.” Id. § 982.503(b). A voucher holder typically pays a landlord\n\n30 percent of her or his adjusted monthly income toward rent; the PHA pays the rent’s balance\n\ndirectly to the landlord, so long as a dwelling’s actual gross rent is at or below the relevant\n\npayment standard. Id. § 982.1(a)(3). If, however, a dwelling’s actual rent exceeds the payment\n\nstandard, the voucher holder pays the balance. Id. A PHA may use the same payment standard\n\namount for all areas within the PHA’s jurisdiction, or else “may establish a separate payment\n\nstandard amount for each designated part of the FMR area.” Id. § 982.503(a)(3).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  3\n\f       B.      Problems with FMR Calculations in Metropolitan Areas\n\n       FMRs often do not, in practice, accurately reflect rents actually charged in neighborhoods\n\nwithin a broad metropolitan area, as “rents can vary widely within a metropolitan area depending\n\nupon the size of the metropolitan area and the neighborhood in the metropolitan area within\n\nwhich one resides.” See Establishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small\n\nArea Fair Market Rents in the Housing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th\n\nPercentile FMRs, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567, 80,567 (Nov. 16, 2016) (“Final Rule”). Consequently,\n\n“[t]he result of determining rents on the basis of an entire metropolitan area is that a voucher\n\nsubsidy . . . may be too low to cover market rent in a given neighborhood.” Id. FMRs calculated\n\non metropolitan-wide bases may not enable voucher holders to afford rents in high-rent, high-\n\nopportunity neighborhoods, consigning them to low-opportunity areas of concentrated poverty.\n\nSee id.; Moore Decl. ¶¶ 5–7; Pls.’ Mot., Attach. 4, Decl. of Crystal Carter (“Carter Decl.”) ¶¶ 6–\n\n7, ECF No. 15-4. Calculating FMRs locally, in contrast, makes rents in high-opportunity areas\n\nmore affordable.\n\n       Prior to 2000, HUD generally calculated FMRs to reflect the 40th percentile rent in a\n\ngiven metropolitan area. See 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(a)–(b). In 2000, however, HUD published a\n\nnew rule authorizing PHAs in areas meeting specified criteria to calculate payment standards\n\nbased on FMRs reflecting the 50th percentile rent in a given area. See Fair Market Rents:\n\nIncreased Fair Market Rents and Higher Payment Standards for Certain Areas, 65 Fed. Reg.\n\n58,870, 58,870 (Oct. 2, 2000). This new policy was “designed to achieve two fundamental\n\nprogram objectives: (1) Ensuring that low-income families are successful in finding and leasing\n\ndecent and affordable housing; and (2) ensuring that low-income families have access to a broad\n\nrange of housing opportunities throughout a metropolitan area.” Id. Consistent with these goals,\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fthe 50th Percentile Rule authorized PHAs to calculate payment standards using a 50th percentile\n\nFMR under two circumstances: where “families are having difficulty using housing vouchers to\n\nfind and lease decent and affordable housing” and “a FMR increase is most needed to promote\n\nresidential choice, help families move closer to areas of job growth, and deconcentrate poverty.”\n\nId. FMR calculation would revert to a 40th percentile basis, however, in PHAs that experienced\n\nno or an insufficient decrease in concentration of voucher holders after three years. Id. at 58,871.\n\n       HUD has concluded, based on recent research, that the 50th Percentile Rule is “not an\n\neffective tool” for “increasing HCV tenant moves from areas of low opportunity to higher\n\nopportunity areas.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,570. Rather, HUD has found that “much of\n\nthe benefit of increased FMRs simply accrues to landlords in lower rent submarket areas in the\n\nform of higher rents rather than creating an incentive for tenants to move to units in communities\n\nwith more and/or better opportunities.” Id. HUD also observed that a “large number of areas\n\nhave been disqualified from the 50th percentile program for failure to show measurable\n\nreduction in voucher concentration of HCV tenants since 2001 when the program started, which\n\nstrongly suggests that the deconcentration objective is not being met.” Id.\n\n       C.      The Small Area FMR Demonstration Project\n\n       In the wake of the 50th Percentile Rule’s apparent failure, HUD considered alternative\n\nways to expand housing opportunities for voucher holders. See id. Using census data collected\n\nthrough the American Community Survey, HUD developed “Small Area FMRs” (“SAFMRs”),\n\nwhich reflect fair-market rents in individual ZIP codes, rather than in broad metropolitan areas.\n\nId. HUD’s goal in applying this new, more targeted methodology was to “create more effective\n\nmeans for HCV tenants to move into higher opportunity, lower poverty areas by providing them\n\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fwith subsidy adequate to make such areas accessible and to thereby reduce the number of\n\nvoucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.” Id. 2\n\n        HUD undertook a demonstration project to test SAFMRs’ effectiveness. Section 8\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program Demonstration Project of Small Area Fair Market Rents in\n\nCertain Metropolitan Areas for Fiscal Year 2011, 75 Fed. Reg. 27,808, 27,809 (May 18, 2010)\n\n(“Proposed Demonstration Project”). Notably, HUD recognized, in announcing the project, that\n\n“[t]he small area FMR demonstration project will not be effective unless the PHAs that operate\n\nvoucher programs covering the vast majority of voucher tenants in a metropolitan area agree to\n\nparticipate and abide by the small area rents.” Id. at 27,811. In a subsequent notice describing\n\nthe project in more detail, HUD explained that SAFMRs “represent a fundamentally different\n\nway of operating the voucher program in metropolitan areas,” and that the project would help\n\nHUD “to better understand the programmatic impacts of changing the way voucher payment\n\nstandards are set.” Final Fair Market Rents for the Housing Choice Voucher Program for Small\n\nArea Fair Market Rent Demonstration Program Participants; Fiscal Year 2013, 77 Fed. Reg.\n\n69,651, 69,652 (Nov. 20, 2012) (“Demonstration Project”). HUD identified two purposes that\n\nthe demonstration project would serve: to (1) “evaluate [SAFMRs] in terms of effectiveness in\n\nmeeting the primary goal of improving tenants’ housing choices in areas of opportunity while\n\nalso assessing the impact on tenants in areas with SAFMRs below the metropolitan-wide FMR”\n\n\n\n2\n         Although SAFMRs are a recent innovation, HUD recognized the shortcomings of FMR schedules based on\nmetropolitan area-wide, rather than more localized, rent levels as early as 1977. See COMPTROLLER GEN. OF THE\nU.S., CED-77-19, M AJOR CHANGES A RE NEEDED IN THE NEW LEASED-HOUSING PROGRAM 21 (1977) (“HUD’s\ndecision to prepare single FMR schedules for entire SMSAs [Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas] or for\ncounties grouped into areas totaling 250,000 population is questionable. This approach ignores important\ndistinctions between metropolitan central cities and suburban areas as well as among suburban areas within SMSAs,\nand it does not adequately consider the economic and demographic differences among non-SMSA counties. For\nexample, the San Francisco-Oakland, California, SMSA had identical FMRs for the counties of Alameda, Contra\nCosta, Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo. HUD field office officials said that each of these counties’ actual\nmarket rents could vary by 30 to 40 percent.”).\n\n                                                       6\n\fand (2) “understand and evaluate the administrative and budget impacts of converting and\n\noperating the tenant-based voucher program using SAFMRs.” Id. In selecting pilot PHAs to\n\nparticipate in the demonstration project, HUD used seven fixed, objective criteria to define an\n\ninitial pool of eligible PHAs, then “randomly selected” pilot areas “from stratified sets of eligible\n\nPHAs.” Id. HUD ultimately selected five pilot PHAs from this pool: the (1) Chattanooga\n\n(Tenn.) Housing Authority, (2) Housing Authority of the City of Laredo (Tex.), (3) Housing\n\nAuthority of the City of Long Beach (Cal.), (4) Housing Authority of the County of Cook (Ill.),\n\nand (5) Town of Mamaroneck (N.Y.) Public Housing Agency. Id. HUD also included all\n\nDallas, Texas, metropolitan area PHAs, which since 2010 had implemented SAFMRs pursuant\n\nto a settlement agreement, in the demonstration project.

Reg. 46,958, 46,962 (Aug. 4, 2010).\n\n       D.      The SAFMR Rule\n\n       Before the demonstration project’s completion, HUD published advance notice of\n\nproposed rulemaking announcing the agency’s intent to require several other metropolitan areas\n\nmeeting certain criteria to implement SAFMRs. See Establishing a More Effective Fair Market\n\nRent (FMR) System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents (SAFMRs) in Housing Choice\n\nVoucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs; Advanced Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking, 80 Fed. Reg. 31,332 (June 2, 2015). HUD cited in this advance notice “research\n\nand experience with the SAFMR demonstration” indicating “that amending its current FMR\n\nregulation to enable adoption of the SAFMR methodology could provide HCV tenants greater\n\naccess to higher opportunity, lower poverty neighborhoods.” Id. at 31,333. As part of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fadvance notice, HUD also announced that the new Rule “would eliminate the use of 50th\n\npercentile FMRs as a means to reduce HCV tenant concentration.” Id.\n\n       One year later, on June 16, 2016, HUD published a notice of the proposed new rule. See\n\nEstablishing a More Effective Fair Market Rent System; Using Small Area Fair Market Rents in\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program Instead of the Current 50th Percentile FMRs, 81 Fed. Reg.\n\n39,218 (June 16, 2016) (“NPRM”). In doing so, HUD acknowledged that “[i]n order for Small\n\nArea FMRs to work in expanding choice for voucher holders within designated metropolitan\n\nareas, all PHAs operating in the FMR area would be required to use Small Area FMRs.” Id. at\n\n39,224. The proposed rule addressed concerns raised in response to the advance notice and\n\nsought additional comments on specific issues, including policies HUD should adopt to “mitigate\n\nthe impact of significant and abrupt decreases in the FMRs for certain ZIP code areas on families\n\n. . . in those impacted areas” and whether “this policy change would be particularly burdensome”\n\nto any “specific groups within the general population of voucher holders.” Id. at 39,225.\n\n       HUD published a final rule on November 16, 2016. Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 80,567.\n\nCalculating payment standards based on SAFMRs, HUD said, would “provid[e] . . . a subsidy\n\nadequate to make such [high-opportunity, low-poverty] areas accessible and, consequently, help\n\nreduce the number of voucher families that reside in areas of high poverty concentration.” Id. at\n\n80,567. “ZIP codes,” HUD reasoned, “are small enough to reflect neighborhood differences and\n\nprovide an easier method of comparing rents within one ZIP code to another ZIP code area\n\nwithin a metropolitan area.” Id. at 80,568. The rule contained several provisions to address\n\nconcerns about SAFMRs’ potential adverse impacts on voucher holders in low-rent ZIP codes.\n\nId. at 80,572. Particularly relevant here, the rule authorized HUD to “suspend a Small Area\n\nFMR designation for a metropolitan area . . . where HUD determines such action is warranted\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fbased on a documented finding of adverse rental housing market conditions that will be set out\n\nby notice,” id. at 80,569, enumerating three circumstances that could warrant a designation’s\n\nsuspension or PHA’s exemption from the SAFMR mandate, 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4). HUD\n\nprovided by notice that the new rule would go into effect on October 1, 2017, requiring affected\n\nPHAs to implement the rule by January 1, 2018, Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 81,569; 24 C.F.R. §\n\n982.503(b)(1), and designated 24 metropolitan areas, which covered over 200 PHAs in total,\n\nsubject to the Rule based on five fixed, objective criteria, see Small Area Fair Market Rents in\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program Values for Selection Criteria and Metropolitan Areas Subject\n\nto Small Area Fair Market Rents, 81 Fed.

Deputy Assistant Sec’y for Pol’y Dev. & Research (“HUD Decl.”) ¶ 5, ECF No. 24-\n\n1. In so doing, HUD required all PHAs within affected metropolitan areas to implement\n\nSAFMRs. These metropolitan areas included the Dallas, Texas area, SAFMR Area Designations,\n\n81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679, in which PHAs, pursuant to the earlier-referenced settlement agreement,\n\nalready had implemented SAFMRs, see NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,221.\n\n       E.      The Interim Report’s Preliminary Findings\n\n       After HUD announced the Rule’s promulgation, but before the Rule was set to go into\n\neffect, HUD received preliminary findings from the demonstration project in the form of an\n\nInterim Report titled Small Area Fair Market Rent Demonstration Evaluation. Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex.\n\n1 (“Interim Report”), ECF No. 24-4. This report contained good news on SAFMRs efficacy to\n\nachieve Section 8’s statutory goals, with mixed results for some demonstration project PHAs.\n\n       Specifically, the Interim Report found that SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs make “the\n\navailability of units [] much more evenly distributed across different types of neighborhoods,\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fleading to increased availability in high-rent ZIP Codes and reduced availability in low-rent ZIP\n\nCodes.” Interim Report at vii; see also id. at viii (“Because SAFMRs increase access to high-\n\nrent ZIP Codes and reduce access to low-rent ZIP Codes, we found not unexpectedly that the\n\ntransition to SAFMRs led to an increase in units potentially available to HCV holders in higher-\n\nopportunity areas under SAFMRs compared with FMRs and fewer units in lower opportunity\n\nareas.”). As a result, “[f]ollowing the implementation of SAFMRs, HCV holders in the\n\ndemonstration sites are slightly more likely to live in high-rent ZIP Codes than they were prior to\n\nthe demonstration,” while no such change was observed in “comparison PHAs.” Id. at viii.\n\nFurther, “[t]he slight changes in rents among the SAFMR PHAs also translate into slight changes\n\nin opportunity.” Id.; see also id. at ix (finding that “[a]cross all evaluation PHAs . . . changes in\n\nrents are also reflected in changes in access to opportunity.”). Moreover, Housing Assistance\n\nPayment (“HAP”) costs, which “are the subsidy costs that PHAs incur on behalf of HCV holders\n\nfor rent and utilities,” “declined in real terms per unit between 2010 and 2015 in SAFMR\n\nPHAs,” while “[r]ents paid to landlords remained nearly flat in real terms between 2010 and\n\n2015 but varied by rent category.” Id. at x. The report states, “[i]n summary, it appears that\n\nSmall Area Fair Market Rents are working as intended—increasing access to units in higher-\n\nopportunity areas and decreasing access in lower-opportunity areas.” Id. at 61.\n\n       At the same time, the Interim Report troublingly found that “the gain in units with rents\n\nbelow the applicable FMR in high-rent ZIP Codes does not offset the decrease in the number of\n\nunits in the low-rent and moderate-rent ZIP Codes, resulting in a net loss of units potentially\n\navailable to HCV holders overall.” Id. at vii. The net effect of SAFMR implementation across\n\nthe pilot PHAs, the Interim Report found, was “a loss of over 22,000 units (3.4 percent) that\n\nmight otherwise be affordable to HCV holders.” Id. In addition, the Interim Report noted that\n\n\n\n                                                  10\n\faverage payment standard amounts declined by about 11 percent in inflation-adjusted terms in\n\npilot PHAs, resulting in average rent burden increases for HCV voucher holders of about 16\n\npercent overall and 22 percent in low-income ZIP codes. Id. at ix–x. In contrast, payment\n\nstandard amounts relying on metropolitan area-wide FMRs declined by only about 2 percent,\n\nresulting in an average rent burden increase of 9 percent. Id.\n\n       The Interim Report’s findings related only to Phase 1 of the demonstration project. Id. at\n\nxi. In 2018, HUD will receive a Final Report combining and synthesizing data collected in\n\nPhases 1 and 2, the latter of which will (1) update the Interim Report’s empirical analyses with\n\nnew housing data, and (2) use qualitative interviews of tenants and landlords to determine how\n\nSAFMRs have affected or could affect housing decisions. Id. at xi, 98.\n\n       F.      HUD’s Two-Year Delay of the SAFMR Rule\n\n       On August 10, 2017, HUD issued a memorandum delaying SAFMR designations for 23\n\nof the 24 metropolitan areas subject to the Rule (excluding Dallas), requiring PHAs in affected\n\nareas to implement the Rule in 2020 rather than in 2018. Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex. 2, Suspension of\n\nSmall Area Fair Market Rent (FMR) Designations (“Suspension Mem.”) at 2, ECF No. 24-5.\n\nThe Suspension Memo expressly noted, however, that “any PHA operating in the covered\n\nmetropolitan areas” could still “voluntarily implement[] the use of Small Area FMRs prior to . . .\n\n2019,” and that PHAs in the Dallas metropolitan area would continue to implement SAFMRs\n\npursuant to the settlement agreement. Id. at 1, 3. On August 11, 2017, HUD sent over 200\n\naffected PHAs a letter informing those PHAs that their metropolitan areas’ mandatory SAFMR\n\ndesignations were suspended until 2020. Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex. 3, Letter from Dominique Blom,\n\nGen. Deputy Assistant Sec’y for Public & Indian Housing, HUD, to PHA Exec. Dirs. (“Letter to\n\nPHAs”) (Aug. 11, 2017), ECF No. 24-6; HUD Decl. ¶ 12.\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\f        The Suspension Memo identified “several findings” in the Interim Report “that are\n\nworrisome and where further research is needed to address a number of critical questions with\n\nrespect to the potential harm to HCV families (both participants and applicants) in areas\n\ntransitioning to Small Area FMRs.” Id. at 5. “[F]indings of the interim report that are of most\n\nconcern to HUD,” the Suspension Memo stated, “relate to the availability of units and the impact\n\nof Small Area FMRs on voucher success rates and utilization, and to rent burdens among assisted\n\nhouseholds.” Id. Specifically, the Suspension Memo stated that “[o]ne of the findings of\n\nconcern from the interim report is that the gain in units with rents below the applicable FMR in\n\nhigh-rent ZIP codes did not offset the decrease in the number of units in the low-rent and\n\nmoderate-rent ZIP codes.” Id. The Suspension Memo acknowledged that, by contrast to the\n\noperation of SAFMRs in the pilot PHAs, the Rule capped any SAFMR decrease to 10 percent\n\nper year, but concluded that this provision “may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as\n\nopposed to preventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families in the\n\nmetropolitan area.” Id. at 5–6. The Suspension Memo also recounted the Interim Report’s\n\nfindings that SAFMRs have potential to increase voucher holders’ rent burdens. Id. at 6. The\n\nSuspension Memo again acknowledged that, by contrast to the operation of SAFMRs in the pilot\n\nPHAs, the Rule allows PHAs to hold nonmoving families harmless from payment standard\n\namount decreases, but noted that “there is no protection for families that must move to a new unit\n\nor for applicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the\n\nfirst time.” Id. at 7.\n\n        The Suspension Memo identified two other concerns with respect to implementing the\n\nRule. The first concern was that “several PHA industry groups have [expressed] concerns about\n\nthe Small Area FMR final rule and the timeline for implementation” in response to a separate\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\fFederal Register notice on reducing regulatory burdens. Id. (citing Reducing Regulatory Burden;\n\nEnforcing the Regulatory Reform Agenda Under Executive Order 13777, 82 Fed. Reg. 22,344\n\n(May 15, 2017)). The Suspension Memo recognized that “HUD has not yet completed its\n\nanalysis of these public comments,” but asserted that “[t]emporarily suspending the Small Area\n\nFMR designation until FY 2020 will allow HUD to be informed by the public comments on\n\nreducing regulatory burden for the HCV program as well as the Final Report . . . before the use\n\nof Small Area FMRs is required.” Id. The second concern was that developing and issuing\n\n“guidance and planning to provide technical assistance to assist PHAs that must implement”\n\nSAFMRs “without fully understanding and incorporating the lessons learned from the\n\nDemonstration will result in a product that does not adequately assist those PHAs that must make\n\nthis [] transition.” Id. at 8. Relatedly, HUD noted that “[i]mplementing comprehensive guidance\n\nthat may become quickly outdated as the result of related regulatory burden reduction and reform\n\nefforts is likewise problematic.” Id.\n\n       G.      The Plaintiffs\n\n       The plaintiffs are two African-American women living in metropolitan areas the Rule\n\nwould affect, as well as Open Communities Alliance (“OCA”), a nonprofit organization devoted\n\nto providing social and economic opportunities for low-income people.

Winter referred to the\nfour factors conjunctively, holding that such a plaintiff “must establish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, that\nhe is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his\nfavor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.” 555 U.S. at 20. Winter also rejected the contention that\n“when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be\nentered based only on a ‘possibility’ of irreparable harm,” holding that “plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief [must]\ndemonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an injunction.” Id. at 21–22 (emphasis in original).\nThe D.C. Circuit repeatedly has observed that “the so-called ‘sliding-scale’ approach to weighing the four\npreliminary injunction factors” may no longer be viable post-Winter, but has never resolved this question one way or\nthe other.

But we have no need to resolve this question here because the remaining factors do not, in any event, weigh in\npetitioners’ favor.”); Sherley, 644 F.3d at 392–93 (“[W]e read Winter at least to suggest if not to hold that a\nlikelihood of success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.” (internal quotation\nmarks omitted)).\n\n                                                           16\n\f        The plaintiffs seek a preliminary injunction requiring HUD to implement the Rule on its\n\neffective date of January 1, 2018. Pls.’ Mot. Their motion challenges the lawfulness of HUD’s\n\ntwo-year delay of the Rule’s implementation in ways relating to claims in the complaint. 5 First,\n\nthe plaintiffs argue that HUD failed to adhere to the requirements of notice and comment\n\nprocedure in delaying the Rule’s implementation. Pls.’ Mem. at 22–27; see Compl. ¶ 143–48.\n\nThe defendants acknowledge HUD delayed the Rule’s implementation without notice or\n\ncomment, but argue that HUD had authority under a promulgated regulation, 24 C.F.R. §\n\n888.113(c)(4), to suspend SAFMR designations and exempt PHAs without resort to notice and\n\ncomment, Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27. The plaintiffs dispute that this regulation conferred such\n\nauthority upon HUD. Pls.’ Mem. at 24–27. Second, the plaintiffs argue that HUD’s delay of the\n\nRule’s implementation was arbitrary and capricious because HUD failed to provide an adequate\n\nexplanation for the delay. Id. at 28–34; see Compl. ¶¶ 149–57. The plaintiffs contend that the\n\nRule’s delayed implementation will irreparably harm them, and that both the balance of equities\n\nand consideration of the public interest weigh in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction. Pls.’\n\nMem. at 34–43. Here, for reasons explained in further detail below, the plaintiffs have carried\n\ntheir burdens of demonstrating all four factors, and so merit a preliminary injunction under either\n\nthe “independent factors” or “sliding scale” approach.\n\n         A.       Likelihood of Success on the Merits\n\n         The plaintiffs’ (1) notice and comment and (2) arbitrary and capricious claims boil down\n\nto a common issue—whether HUD identified adverse rental housing market conditions local to\n\nthe particular PHAs as to which HUD delayed the Rule’s implementation. For reasons explained\n\n\n5\n        The complaint also raises a third claim, asserting that HUD acted contrary to statute in delaying the Rule’s\nimplementation by distributing housing funds in a manner that perpetuates racial segregation and does not provide\nopportunity to rent quality housing throughout a metropolitan area. Compl. ¶¶ 158–163. The plaintiffs’ motion\ndoes not address this argument, and the defendants do not respond to it. See generally Pls.’ Mot.; Defs.’ Opp’n.\n\n                                                        17\n\fbelow, HUD did not. HUD’s failure to connect the Rule’s delayed implementation in specific\n\nPHAs by reference to local conditions means 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4) gave the agency no\n\nauthority to act without notice and comment, and also that HUD’s decision-making was arbitrary\n\nand capricious. The plaintiffs thus have shown likely success on their claims’ merits.\n\n        1.       HUD Lacked Authority to Delay the Rule’s Implementation.\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that they likely will succeed on the merits of their claim that HUD’s\n\ndelay of the Rule is procedurally defective because HUD did not observe the requirements of\n\nnotice and comment. Pls.’ Mem. at 22–27. HUD, invoking a provision of the Rule, argues\n\nunsuccessfully that the Secretary has broad authority to delay the Rule’s implementation\n\nwholesale whenever the Secretary determines he has reason to do so. Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27;\n\nHr’g Tr. (Dec. 19, 2017) at 30. 6 The plaintiffs, relying on the same Rule provision, argue that\n\nthe Secretary’s authority is more circumscribed, and does not reach HUD’s action here.

The Court concludes\n\nthat although HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA within such a\n\ndesignated area under circumstances in which SAFMRs may adversely impact the area or PHA’s\n\nrental housing unit supply, HUD has made no such area-specific showing with respect to the 23\n\nmetropolitan areas as to which the agency delayed the Rule’s implementation. As such, the\n\nplaintiffs have demonstrated likely success on the merits on their notice and comment claim. 7\n\n\n\n\n6\n          All citations to the December 19, 2017 hearing transcript cite to a rough draft of the transcript. A final\ndraft of the transcript is forthcoming and will be made available on this case’s docket. Discrepancies between the\nrough and final transcript drafts regarding page numbers may exist.\n7\n          The defendants’ argument that HUD soon will rescind the Rule through notice and comment and thus moot\nthe plaintiffs’ notice and comment claim, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 31, only underscores that HUD has not yet invoked\nnotice and comment, and thus, that the plaintiffs’ claim is not moot.

Section 888.113(c)(4) allows\n\nHUD to temporarily suspend a region’s SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA from use of\n\nSAFMRs under specified circumstances. The regulation provides, in relevant part:\n\n       HUD may suspend a Small Area FMR designation from a metropolitan area, or\n       may temporarily exempt a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area from use\n       of the Small Area FMRs, when HUD by notice makes a documented determination\n       that such action is warranted. Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension\n       of Small Area FMRs are:\n\n       (i)     A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the loss of a substantial\n               number of housing units;\n\n       (ii)    A sudden influx of displaced households needing permanent housing; or\n\n       (iii)   Other events as determined by the Secretary.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\n       Section 888.133(c)(4)’s plain language makes clear that HUD may suspend an SAFMR\n\ndesignation or exempt a PHA only upon one of three enumerated actions’ occurrence.

The Court examined the provision’s two clauses insulating from judicial review, in\n\nclause (i), certain discretionary administrative judgments authorized by specific statutes, and, in\n\nclause (ii), “any other decision . . . the authority for which is specified under this subchapter.”\n\nId. at 246. Citing the “lead line” introducing both clauses, the “proximity of clauses (i) and (ii)\n\nand the words linking them—‘any other decision,’” the Supreme Court reasoned that “[t]he\n\nclause (i) enumeration . . . is instructive in determining the meaning of the clause (ii) catchall,”\n\nultimately reasoning “that Congress had in mind decisions of the same genre,” namely, “that\n\nCongress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the\n\nAttorney General’s discretionary authority in the statute.” Id. at 24647. Consequently, the Court\n\nheld, the judicial review bar encompassed only administrative decisions made discretionary by\n\nstatute, not by regulation. Id. at 253–54. As with Kucana, the “lead line” in § 888.113(c)(4) is\n\n“Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs are . . . ,” which places\n\nall three enumerated actions that follow within the category of actions that justify an SAFMR\n\nsuspension or PHA exemption. These actions’ proximity to the lead line and to one another, as\n\nwell as the “[o]ther events” term linking the actions, shows that § 888.113(c)(4), “[r]ead\n\nharminously,” lets HUD suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA only for reasons “of\n\nthe same genre” as those in the first two enumerated actions. Kucana, 558 at 246–47.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  22\n\f         Begay likewise is clarifying. The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a sentencing\n\nenhancement on a defendant who violates 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) and has three prior convictions\n\n“for a violent felony,” defined in part to mean a felony that “is burglary, arson, or extortion,\n\ninvolves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\n\nphysical injury to another.” 18 U.S.C. § 922(e)(2)(B)(ii). “[T]he provision’s listed examples,”\n\nBegay reasoned, “illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute’s scope” and “indicates\n\nthat the statute covers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury to another.” 553 U.S. at 142 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nA Congress intending “the statute to be all encompassing” Begay said, likely would not “have\n\nneeded to include the examples at all,” as the statute “would cover all crimes that present a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury” absent the examples. Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “These considerations taken together,” Begay concluded, “convince us that, to give\n\neffect to every clause and word of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the\n\ncrimes that [the statute] covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of\n\nrisk posed, to the examples themselves.” Id. at 143 (alterations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). Here, as in Begay, § 888.113(c)(4)’s “listed examples” limit the third action’s scope to\n\nactions “that are roughly similar” to the first two actions. Id. at 142–43. The third action thus is\n\nbest construed to encompass only events that involve adverse rental housing market conditions. 8\n\n         Finally, the Rule’s localist phrasing and the interrelation of the Rule’s provisions, viewed\n\nholistically, show that HUD may justify a particular SAFMR designation’s suspension or PHA’s\n\nexemption only through a localized determination that conditions in a particular affected area or\n\n\n\n8\n         Johnson v. United States abrogated Begay by voiding the phrase “otherwise involves conduct that presents\na serious potential risk of physical injury to another,” known as § 922(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s “residual clause,” for vagueness.\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2812210\"><a href=\"/opinion/2812210/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Begay nonetheless persuasively illustrates the ejusdem generis canon’s application.\n\n                                                          23\n\fPHA warrant such action. Section 888.113(c)(4)’s first sentence requires HUD to designate\n\nSAFMR areas each year, which “designations will be permanent.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\nElsewhere, the Rule identifies (1) five fixed, objective “criteria used to determine those\n\nmetropolitan areas” to receive designations and (2) precise, dynamic “selection values” for each\n\ncriterion. Id. § 888.113(c)(1) (identifying selection criteria); SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed.\n\nReg. at 80,679 (identifying selection values); see also infra Part III.A.2. Section 888.113(c)(4)’s\n\nsecond sentence allows HUD to suspend “a Small Area FMR designation from a metropolitan\n\narea” and to exempt “a PHA in a Small Area FMR metropolitan area” upon “a documented\n\ndetermination that such action is warranted.” Id. (emphasis added). Notably, this sentence does\n\nnot authorize HUD to suspend, in wholesale fashion, “all SAFMR designations” or exempt “all\n\naffected PHAs” in “all metropolitan areas.” This language, rather, focuses HUD’s inquiry on\n\nindividualized reasons for suspending a particular designation or exempting a particular PHA.\n\n        The third sentence cabins HUD’s discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt\n\na PHA, enumerating three “[a]ctions” that “may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area\n\nFMRs.” Id. 9 The first two actions—“A Presidentially declared disaster area that results in the\n\nloss of a substantial number of housing units” and “A sudden influx of displaced households\n\nneeding permanent housing,” id. § 888.113(c)(4)(i)–(ii)—do not merely address free-floating\n\npolicy concerns. Each action, by nature, affects discrete, particular geographic areas. Thus, §\n\n888.113(c)(4), read as a whole and in concert with surrounding provisions, requires HUD to\n\njustify a particular SAFMR designation’s suspension or PHA’s exemption by reference to\n\nspecific rental housing market conditions local to the affected area. HUD may not, in other\n\n\n\n\n9\n       Notably, again, this sentence references “a suspension of [SA]FMRs.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4)\n(emphasis added).\n\n                                                      24\n\fwords, suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA by citing abstract policy concerns or\n\nconclusions extrapolated from data with no or only tenuous relation to the specific affected PHA.\n\n       The plaintiffs and defendants read § 888.113(c)(4) differently. The plaintiffs understand\n\nHUD’s authority to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA more narrowly, arguing\n\nthat the term “events” reaches only “unexpected events resulting in a sudden change in localized\n\nrental market conditions.” Pls.’ Mem. at 26. “Whether market conditions have ‘negative\n\nimpacts on voucher families,’” the plaintiffs argue, “has nothing to do with whether any area\n\nmeets regulatory criteria for small area designation or whether its FMRs remain reliable.” Pls.’\n\nReply Mem. Supp. Mot. (“Pls.’ Reply”) at 9, ECF No. 25. Section 888.113(c)(4), however, by\n\nits plain terms authorizes HUD to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA even when\n\nthe conditions that triggered the SAFMR’s application to that metropolitan area or PHA still\n\napply, so long as a qualifying event occurs. HUD could have written § 888.113(c)(4) in terms\n\nthat would allow SAFMR suspensions or PHA exemptions only when a particular metropolitan\n\narea or PHA no longer satisfied the criteria for SAFMR designation in the first place, but HUD\n\ndid not so limit the suspension/exemption authority that the regulation conferred. Cf. Wallaesa,\n\n824 F.3d at 1083 (“If Congress had intended that narrow meaning, it knew how to say so.”).\n\nMoreover, to construe the term “events” to reach only adverse rental housing market condition\n\nchanges that are “sudden” and “unexpected” has no basis in the regulatory text, is neither\n\ncompelled by nor necessary to give effect to the two preceding actions, and would leave HUD\n\npowerless to suspend the Rule’s impact under circumstances that, though foreseen or gradual,\n\nnegatively impact voucher holders. Construing “events” to reach any “adverse rental housing\n\nmarket conditions,” in contrast, finds support in the preambulatory text, gives effect to the two\n\npreceding exemplar actions, and leaves HUD flexibility to suspend an SAFMR designation or\n\n\n\n                                                25\n\fexempt a particular PHA under circumstances that, although either foreseen or gradual,\n\nnonetheless negatively impact voucher holders.\n\n       The defendants, in turn, contend that § 888.113(c)(4) vests HUD with virtually boundless\n\nauthority to suspend SAFMR designations or exempt PHAs. The defendants specifically argue\n\nthat (1) the three enumerated actions merely illustrate, rather than exhaust, the sort of actions that\n\ntrigger HUD’s authority to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA, and (2) the third\n\naction gives HUD unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation or exempt a PHA\n\nfor essentially any reason. Defs.’ Opp’n at 21–27. These arguments do not pass muster.\n\n       First, the defendants argue that § 888.113(c)(4) does not provide an exclusive list of\n\nactions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA, but merely\n\nnonexclusive examples of such actions. Defs.’ Opp’n at 23–24. This construction is inconsistent\n\nwith § 888.113(c)(4)’s phrasing, which provides, “Actions that may serve as the basis of a\n\nsuspension of Small Area FMRs are,” then lists three specific actions. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4)\n\n(emphasis added). Section 888.113(c)(4)’s use of the term “are” rather than “include” compels a\n\nconclusion that the enumerated examples constitute an exclusive, rather than merely illustrative,\n\nlist of actions that may justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA. Had\n\nHUD wished to reserve to itself authority to suspend an SAFMR designation for reasons other\n\nthan an enumerated action’s occurrence, HUD could have drafted § 888.113(c)(4) to provide that\n\n“Actions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs include” the three\n\nenumerated actions. HUD, however, did not do that; by drafting § 888.113(c)(4) to contain the\n\nterm “are” rather than “include,” HUD limited its authority to suspend an SAFMR designation to\n\nthe occurrence of an enumerated action. Cf. Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at 1083.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 26\n\f       Second, the defendants argue that even if HUD may suspend an SAFMR designation or\n\nexempt a PHA only upon an enumerated action’s occurrence, the third action is phrased so\n\nbroadly as to give HUD essentially unreviewable discretion to suspend an SAFMR designation\n\nor exempt a PHA for any reason. Defs.’ Opp’n at 22–26. The ejusdem generis canon, the\n\ndefendants say, is inapplicable because § 888.113(c)(4) contains no “general term which follows\n\nspecific ones.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 24 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is\n\nincorrect. Section 888.113(c)(4) enumerates two specific actions—“A Presidentially declared\n\ndisaster area that results in the loss of a substantial number of housing units” and “A sudden\n\ninflux of displaced needing permanent housing”—followed by a third, more general action—\n\n“Other events as determined by the Secretary.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\n       The defendants contend that the Rule’s overall context shows that ejusdem generis does\n\nnot apply, identifying three aspects of the Rule that the defendants characterize indicating “an\n\nintent to be expansive.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 24–25. Although “the ejusdem generis canon does not\n\ncontrol when the whole context dictates a different conclusion,” Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at 1081\n\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted), the defendants’ argument actually ignores the\n\nregulation’s pertinent context and precise language. The defendants observe that the regulation\n\nuses “self-contained, broadly permissive language.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 25. The ejusdem generis\n\ncanon applies, however, to language that otherwise reads broadly. See Wallaesa, 824 F.3d at\n\n1081. The defendants note that “the language introducing the enumerated examples contains no\n\nindication that those examples are meant to restrict the circumstances under which HUD may\n\nfind a suspension warranted.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 25. The ejusdem generis canon, however,\n\nrequires no clear statement that specific language limits general language’s scope. Indeed, to\n\nrequire such clarity would defeat the canon’s purpose of clarifying ambiguous statutes. Finally,\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fthe defendants observe that the third action’s wording “specifically states that the nature of the\n\nreferenced ‘events’ are those that are ‘determined by the Secretary,’ not those that are similar in\n\nkind to the preceding examples,” which the defendants argue “forecloses the notion that the\n\nnature of the ‘events’ referenced therein is to be limited by the preceding examples.” Id. That\n\nHUD has some discretion to determine which events justify suspending an SAFMR designation\n\nis undisputed, however; the question is whether that discretion is bounded. Here, the sequence of\n\ntwo specifically-phrased actions followed by a generally-phrased third action indicates that the\n\nfirst two actions limit HUD discretion under the third action. To construe the third action as\n\nreaching any event the first two actions do not reach would defeat the purpose of enumerating an\n\nexclusive list of “[a]ctions that may serve as the basis of a suspension of Small Area FMRs.” 24\n\nC.F.R. § 888.113(c)(4).\n\n       Nor would applying the ejusdem generis canon render the phrase “as determined by the\n\nSecretary” superfluous. This language, read in context, can be read to vest HUD with discretion\n\nto determine whether a qualifying event warrants an SAFMR designation’s suspension or a\n\nPHA’s exemption, such that HUD need not suspend a designation or exempt a PHA each time a\n\ndesignated area or PHA experiences a disaster. This language does not allow HUD to determine\n\nwhether something qualifies as an “event” in the first place. In other words, § 888.113(c)(4)(iii)\n\ngives HUD discretion, but cabins that discretion by allowing its exercise only upon a qualifying\n\n“event[’s]” occurrence. The defendants compare the phrase “other events as determined by the\n\nSecretary” to the language of 49 U.S.C. § 44702(d)(2), which authorizes the Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration to “rescind a delegation . . . at any time for any reason the [agency] considers\n\nappropriate”—language the D.C.

Defs.’ Opp’n at 25–26.\n\nAs explained in detail above, however, the defendants’ construction is “inconsistent with the\n\nregulation,” Press Commc’ns LLC, 875 F.3d at 1121, and thus due no deference. 10\n\n                 b)       HUD Failed to Identify Local Adverse Rental Housing Market Conditions\n\n        Whether HUD invoked a proper triggering “event” to justify delaying by two years the\n\nRule’s implementation thus turns on whether HUD based the Rule’s delay on an event involving\n\nlocal “adverse rental housing market conditions.” The Suspension Memorandum presents three\n\nrationales for delaying the Rule’s implementation: (1) the Interim Report’s findings showing the\n\nRule’s potentially negative impact on voucher holders; (2) comments received in response to the\n\nReducing Regulatory Burden notice; and (3) HUD’s failure timely to create SAFMR guidance\n\nand technical assistance for affected PHAs. Suspension Mem. at 5–8. The latter two rationales\n\nhave nothing to do with local rental housing market conditions in the 23 affected PHAs, and so\n\ncannot independently sustain HUD’s invocation of § 888.113(c)(4)’s third action. As to the\n\nRule’s potential adverse impact on voucher holders, the Suspension Memorandum identified\n\nevidence from the Interim Report, which evaluated the demonstration project’s preliminary\n\nfindings, that SAFMRs may decrease rental housing unit stock.

The\n\nInterim Report stated that although the pilot PHAs’ use of SAFMRs\n\n        should increase the pool of units potentially available . . . in high-rent FMRs, while\n        reducing the pool of units that are located in lower-rent ZIP codes . . . . the gain in\n        units with rents below the applicable FMR in high-rent ZIP codes did not offset the\n        decrease in the number of units in the low-rent and moderate-rent ZIP codes,\n        resulting in a net loss of units that are potentially available to voucher families.\n\nSuspension Mem. at 5; see Interim Report at vii.

For example, in at least\n\none significant way, the Long Beach pilot PHA did not demographically represent the Rule-\n\naffected PHAs. Long Beach’s high-rent ZIP codes contained only 11 percent of the PHA’s\n\nrental housing units, a lower figure than for any other pilot PHA. Interim Report at 28 & tbl. 4-\n\n1. By contrast, high-rent ZIP codes in each Rule-affected area must, according to the selection\n\ncriteria, contain at least 20 percent of the area’s total rental housing unit supply. See SAFMR\n\nArea Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679; 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(1). 12 This contrast is\n\nsignificant because SAFMRs increase rental unit affordability in high-rent ZIP codes and\n\ndecrease rental unit affordability in low-rent ZIP codes, and thus reduce overall rental housing\n\nunit supply more dramatically in areas like Long Beach, which have relatively few high-rent\n\nunits, than areas with more high-rent units. Interim Report at 32–34. “[I]f fewer rental units . . .\n\nare in high-rent ZIP Codes than in low-rent ZIP Codes . . . then the shift to SAFMRs will mean\n\nfewer units” available. Id. at 34.\n\n        Long Beach, though only one of the seven pilot PHAs, distorted the demonstration\n\nproject’s findings because much of the net decrease in rental housing unit supply that the project\n\nattributed to SAFMRs occurred in Long Beach. The Interim Report found that decreases in\n\nrental housing unit supply largely were concentrated in Long Beach, which saw a greater than 10\n\n\n\n\n12\n         The Interim Report defined a high-rent ZIP code as a zip code with a “rent ratio”—the ratio of a two-\nbedroom SAFMR over a two-bedroom metropolitan area FMR—of greater than 1.1, and a low-rent ZIP code as a\nzip code with a rent ratio of below 0.9. Interim Report at 27.\n\n                                                       31\n\fpercent net loss of rental housing unit supply. Id. at vii. 13 By contrast, two pilot PHAs—Laredo\n\nand Mamaroneck—saw “virtually no change in the overall number of units” available after\n\nimplementing SAFMRs whatsoever. Id. at 33 & tbl. 4-5. Long Beach, an area demographically\n\nunrepresentative of the Rule-affected areas, thus skewed the demonstration project’s findings.\n\n        The pilot PHAs also did not represent Rule-affected areas with respect to the SAFMR\n\nmandate’s geographic scope within a metropolitan area. Only two of the seven pilot PHAs—\n\nLaredo and Mamaroneck—mandated SAFMR use throughout the entire metropolitan area. Id. at\n\n33. Laredo and Mamaroneck were “unique among the SAFMR PHAs in that their jurisdictions\n\nare the same as the geographies for which their respective FMRs are calculated.” Id. Laredo and\n\nMamaroneck, in other words, were the only PHAs in their respective metropolitan areas, and, as\n\nsuch, implementation of SAFMRs applied across those two PHAs’ entire metropolitan areas.\n\nFive of the seven pilot PHAs, however, did not make PHA use mandatory across an entire\n\nmetropolitan area. Id. In contrast, all PHAs within each metropolitan area that the Rule affects\n\nuse SAFMRs. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(3); Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,568. An SAFMR’s\n\ngeographic scope within a metropolitan area matters because “[i]f only a few agencies within a\n\nmetropolitan area use Small Area FMRs, voucher holders may have difficulty moving to high-\n\nopportunity neighborhoods outside those agencies’ jurisdiction.” CBPP Decl. ¶ 7. “For\n\nexample, if an urban agency adopts Small Area FMRs but the surrounding suburbs do not, then\n\nfamilies will face the same cost hurdles that currently prevent them from moving to lower-\n\npoverty, suburban neighborhoods.” Id. Indeed, HUD itself acknowledged this conclusion during\n\nboth the demonstration project and the rulemaking period. See NPRM, 81 Fed. Reg. at 39,224;\n\nProposed Demonstration Project, 75 Fed. Reg. at 27,811. When PHAs in low-rent ZIP codes,\n\n\n13\n       The Dallas pilot PHA also saw a large decrease in number of rental housing units lost, but this loss\namounted to only 4% of the Dallas pilot PHA’s total rental housing unit supply. Interim Report at vii.\n\n                                                        32\n\fbut not PHAs in high-rent ZIP codes, adopt SAFMRs, voucher holders will face rising rents in\n\nlow-income areas but no commensurate decrease in rents in high-rent ZIP codes. SAFMRs’\n\nsuccess thus requires all PHAs within a metropolitan area to adopt SAFMRs. Laredo and\n\nMamaroneck, the only two pilot PHAs that implemented SAFMRs throughout their entire\n\nmetropolitan areas, significantly were the only pilot PHAs that saw virtually no decrease in\n\nrental housing unit supply. Interim Report at 33. The lack of any metropolitan area-wide\n\nSAFMR mandate in five of seven pilot PHAs’ respective metropolitan areas raises yet another\n\nquestion about the demonstration project findings’ applicability to the Rule-affected areas, which\n\nmandate SAFMR use throughout their entire metropolitan areas.\n\n       That the pilot PHAs were not representative of Rule-affected PHAs is unsurprising, as\n\nHUD used entirely different criteria to select these two groups. HUD used five fixed, objective\n\n“selection criteria” to determine which PHAs the Rule would cover: the (1) “number of vouchers\n\nunder lease in the metropolitan FMR area;” (2) “percentage of the standard quality rental stock,\n\nwithin the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small Area FMR is\n\nmore than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR area;” (3) “percentage of voucher families living\n\nin concentrated low income areas;” (4) “percentage of voucher families living in concentrated\n\nlow income areas relative to the percentage of all renters within these areas over the entire\n\nmetropolitan area;” and (5) “vacancy rate for the metropolitan area.” 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(1).\n\nHUD also, by notice published in the Federal Register, identified objective “selection values” for\n\neach criterion “to determine . . . metropolitan FMR areas subject to Small Area FMRs”: (1)\n\n“[t]here are at least 2,500 HCV under lease;” (2) “[a]t least 20 percent of the standard quality\n\nrental stock, within the metropolitan FMR area is in small areas (ZIP codes) where the Small\n\nArea FMR is more than 110 percent of the metropolitan FMR;” (3) “[t]he percentage of voucher\n\n\n\n                                                 33\n\ffamilies living in concentrated low income areas relative to all renters within the area must be at\n\nleast 25 percent;” (4) “[t]he measure of the percentage of voucher holders living in concentrated\n\nlow income areas relative to all renters within these areas over the entire metropolitan area\n\nexceeds 155 percent;” and (5) “[t]he vacancy rate for the metropolitan area is higher than 4\n\npercent.” SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679. 14\n\n        Entirely different criteria guided the pilot PHAs’ selection. HUD first constructed a pool\n\nof PHAs that met seven initial criteria, which were entirely different than the criteria HUD used\n\nto determine the Rule’s coverage. HUD included in the initial pool each PHA that: (1) “[h]ad at\n\nleast 500 vouchers in use as of September 30, 2011;” (2) “[h]ad at least 10 housing choice\n\nvoucher (HCV) tenants living in ZIP Codes where the SAFMR exceeded the metropolitan area\n\nFair Market Rent (FMR) by more than 10 percent in fiscal year 2012;” (3) “[h]ad at least 10\n\nHCV tenants living in ZIP Codes where the SAFMR was more than 10 percent less than the\n\nmetropolitan area FMR;” (4) “[h]ad attained at least 95 percent HCV family reporting in Public\n\nand Indian Housing Information Center;” (5) “[w]as not troubled, as determined by the Section 8\n\nManagement Assessment Program;” (6) “[h]ad the administrative capacity to carry out the\n\nSAFMR program;” and (7) “[h]ad not been involved in litigation that would seriously impede its\n\nability to administer the HCV program.” Demonstration Project, 77 Fed. Reg. at 69,652. These\n\ncriteria produced a pool of 247 eligible PHAs, which HUD organized into eight selection clusters\n\nbased on each PHA’s (1) number of vouchers (small or large), (2) metropolitan area two-\n\nbedroom FMR (low or high), and (3) number of working-age heads of household (low or high\n\n\n\n\n14\n         With respect to the fifth criterion, HUD defined a metropolitan area’s vacancy rate as “the number of\nVacant For Rent Units divided by the sum of the number of Vacant For Rent Units, the number of Renter Occupied\nUnits, and the number of Rented, not occupied units.” SAFMR Area Designations, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,679. HUD\ncalculated the vacancy rate “using data from the 1-year American Community Survey (ACS) tabulations” by\naveraging values “from the 3 most current ACS 1 year datasets available.” Id.\n\n                                                     34\n\fpercentage). Interim Report at 99 & tbl. A-1. HUD then randomly ordered PHAs within each\n\ncluster, and invited the PHA at the top of each cluster to participate in the demonstration project.\n\nId. at 100. When a PHA declined to participate, HUD invited a cluster’s next ranking PHA. Id.\n\nAfter several rounds of invitations, five PHAs had agreed to participate in the demonstration\n\nproject. Id. Finally, HUD included in the project two PHAs from the Dallas metropolitan area,\n\nwhich have used SAFMRs since 2011 pursuant to a settlement agreement. Id. at 3.\n\n       HUD’s decision to use different selection criteria for the pilot PHAs and Rule-affected\n\nareas reflects the different purposes HUD intended the demonstration project and Rule to serve.\n\nHUD “randomly selected five PHAs for the demonstration that differed across various\n\ncharacteristics” because HUD sought “[t]o test how SAFMRs may potentially affect a range of\n\nPHA types.” Interim Report at 2. In promulgating the Rule, however, HUD specifically targeted\n\n“those metropolitan areas . . . where establishing FMRs by ZIP code areas has the potential to\n\nsignificantly increase opportunities for voucher families.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,568.\n\nHUD’s different objectives in undertaking the demonstration project and promulgating the Rule\n\nfurther illustrate the inadequacy of HUD’s reliance on the demonstration project’s preliminary\n\nfindings to justify the Rule’s delay.\n\n       Finally, HUD’s incorporation into the Rule of various provisions designed to protect\n\nagainst the very concerns that the demonstration project identified further undermines HUD’s\n\nreliance on demonstration project data to delay the Rule. Most significantly, as discussed above,\n\nthe Rule requires all PHAs within an affected metropolitan area to use SAFMRs, addressing a\n\ncrucial issue that the demonstration project uncovered. 24 C.F.R. § 888.113(c)(3); Final Rule, 81\n\nFed. Reg. at 80,568. The Rule also contains several other provisions to protect voucher holders\n\nagainst issues the demonstration project revealed, including (1) “limit[ing] the annual decrease in\n\n\n\n                                                 35\n\fSmall Area FMRs to no more than 10 percent of the area’s FMR in the prior fiscal year” and\n\nallowing PHAs to (2) “hold harmless those families remaining in place from payment standard\n\nreductions,” (3) “establish a new payment standard for families under HAP contract between the\n\nfull ‘hold harmless’ option . . . and the new payment standard based on the Small Area FMR,”\n\n(4) “establish different policies regarding how decreases in payment standards will apply [to\n\nvoucher holders] for designated areas within their jurisdiction,” and (5) “request and receive\n\napproval to establish an exception payment standard promptly for a ZIP Code area if necessary\n\nto react to rapidly changing market conditions or to ensure sufficient rental units are available for\n\nvoucher families.” Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,572–74. HUD has discounted the importance\n\nof two of these five enumerated voucher holder protections incorporated into the Rule, noting\n\nthat the 10 percent SAFMR cap “may only slow the pace of the loss of units, as opposed to\n\npreventing the overall decline in the number of units available to HCV families,” and that the\n\n“hold harmless” provision does not “protect[] families that must move to a new unit or []\n\napplicant families off the waiting list who are trying to lease a unit on the program for the first\n\ntime.” Suspension Mem. at 5–7. HUD seemingly has not, however, considered or addressed the\n\nRule’s other voucher holder protection provisions. 15\n\n        In sum, the significant differences between the (1) pilot and Rule-affected PHAs, (2)\n\nselection criteria HUD used to identify each group, and (3) purposes HUD sought the\n\ndemonstration project and Rule to achieve impose on HUD a burden to show that any\n\nconclusions the Interim Report extrapolated from the demonstration project’s findings apply to\n\n\n\n15\n         As the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, which filed a brief as amicus\ncuriae in support of plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, observe, various provisions of the Rule are\n“expressly designed to limit Rule-related increases in tenants’ rent burdens . . . . [b]ut HUD makes no mention of\nthese differences between the demonstration project and the Small Area Rule, even as it relies on the Interim\nEvaluation of the demonstration projects as a justification for suspending implementation of the Rule.” Amicus Br.\nat 8, ECF No. 21.\n\n                                                       36\n\fthe specific Rule-affected areas. Neither the Suspension Memo nor Letter to PHAs, however,\n\neven attempt to make such a showing. Nor, for that matter, does the defendants’ briefing. The\n\nplaintiffs thus have established likely success on the merits of their notice and comment claim.\n\n       2. HUD’s Delay of the Rule’s Implementation Was Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n       The plaintiffs also argue that HUD’s delay of the Rule’s implementation was arbitrary\n\nand capricious. Pls.’ Mem at 28–34. According to the plaintiffs, HUD failed adequately to\n\nexplain its reasons for delaying the Rule’s implementation. Id. at 28. As explained above, §\n\n888.113(c)(4) required HUD to identify adverse rental housing market conditions local to a\n\nparticular area or PHA to justify suspending an SAFMR designation or exempting a PHA in that\n\narea. HUD, as explained, did no such thing. Instead, HUD attempted to justify delaying the\n\nRule’s implementation by two years by citing data based on a small number of pilot PHAs,\n\nwhich did not represent the Rule-affected areas in terms of demographics or scope and which\n\nHUD selected partially randomly (1) on the basis of entirely different criteria than those HUD\n\nused to select the Rule-affected areas and (2) for entirely different objectives than HUD sought\n\nto achieve through the Rule’s promulgation. HUD, in so doing, “relied on factors”—i.e., the\n\ndemonstration project data—“which [law] ha[d] not intended it to consider” and “entirely failed\n\nto consider an important aspect of the problem”—i.e., local rental housing market conditions in\n\nthe Rule-affected areas. Mayo, 875 F.3d at 19 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (alterations\n\nomitted)). HUD’s two-year delay of the Rule’s implementation therefore was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious. As such, the plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits as to\n\ntheir arbitrary and capricious claim, for essentially the same reasons they have shown likely\n\nsuccess on the merits as to their notice and comment claim.\n\n       B.      Risk of Irreparable Harm\n\n\n\n                                                37\n\f       The plaintiffs argue that they will suffer irreparable harm if HUD does not implement the\n\nRule by January 1, 2018. “The party seeking a preliminary injunction must make two showings\n\nto demonstrate irreparable harm.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 7. “First, the harm\n\nmust be ‘certain and great,’ ‘actual and not theoretical,’ and so ‘imminent that there is a clear and\n\npresent need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.’” Id. at 7–8 (quoting Chaplaincy of\n\nFull Gospel Churches v.

Here, plaintiffs Crystal Carter, Tiana Moore, and OCA each have made a requisite\n\nshowing of irreparable harm from the Rule’s delay.\n\n       1.      Crystal Carter\n\n       Plaintiff Crystal Carter has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to warrant\n\na preliminary injunction. Ms. Carter and her five minor children currently use a Housing Choice\n\nVoucher to rent a four-bedroom house in the City of Hartford, Connecticut.

Ms. Carter wishes to use\n\nher voucher to move to the town of Simsbury in Hartford County, Connecticut, to be closer to\n\nthose schools. Id. ¶ 6. Simsbury’s poverty rate of 3.4 percent, Decl. of Sasha Samberg-\n\nChampion (“Pls.’ Decl.”), Ex.

G,\n\nPoverty Data for 06114 ZIP Code, ECF No 16-7. Simsbury offers higher quality education and a\n\nsafer living environment for Ms. Carter’s entire family than does Hartford. Carter Decl. ¶ 6. As\n\nthe plaintiffs observe, “[l]iving close to her children’s schools has obvious benefits for any\n\nparent, including reducing the children’s commute times, giving them more opportunity to\n\n\n\n                                                 38\n\fengage with their classmates out of school, and allowing the parent to be more involved with her\n\nchildren’s schools.” Pls.’ Mem. at 39.\n\n        The Rule’s implementation would enable Ms. Carter to move her family from Hartford to\n\nSimsbury; the Rule’s suspension deprives her of the Rule’s benefits. If the Rule goes into effect,\n\nthe FMR for a four-bedroom unit in much of Simsbury will be $1,940 per month for Fiscal Year\n\n2018. See Pls.’ Decl., Ex. F, 2018 Hartford SAFMRs at 2, ECF No. 16-6. 16 Should the Rule’s\n\nimplementation remain delayed, however, the FMR for a four-bedroom dwelling in Simsbury\n\nwill be $1,620 per month, see Pls.’ Decl., Ex. E, 2018 Hartford FMRs at 5, ECF No. 16-5—an\n\namount that Ms. Carter’s experience shows to be insufficient to find an appropriate in Simsbury.\n\nCarter Decl. ¶ 7. The fact that Ms. Carter’s PHA may implement SAFMRs voluntarily, see\n\nSuspension Mem. at 3; Letter to PHAs at 3, does not prevent Ms. Carter from showing\n\nirreparable harm. For the reasons explained above, SAFMRs fail to assist voucher holders to\n\nrelocate to high-opportunity areas unless all or substantially all PHAs within a metropolitan area\n\nimplement SAFMRs, meaning that a single PHA, such as Ms. Carter’s, likely will not implement\n\nSAFMRs voluntarily. Further, HUD’s counsel conceded at oral argument that no Rule-affected\n\nPHA has come forward to opt into the Rule voluntarily, Hr’g Tr. at 18–19, which likewise\n\nillustrates the unlikeliness that Ms. Carter’s PHA will implement SAFMRs voluntarily.\n\n        The defendants correctly observe that Ms. Carter’s children already attend school in\n\nSimsbury, Defs.’ Opp’n at 34, but do not dispute that Ms. Carter would enjoy the obvious\n\nbenefits of “be[ing] closer to [her] children’s schools” and “liv[ing] in a safer and healthier\n\nneighborhood environment for [her] children” if she lived in Simsbury. Carter Decl. ¶ 6. The\n\n\n\n16\n         The Court, relying on the United States Postal Service’s “Look Up A ZIP Code” tool, see Look Up A Zip\nCodeTM, U.S. POSTAL SERV., https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action?mode=2&refresh=true (last\nvisited Dec. 23, 2017), takes judicial notice that the ZIP Code for much of Simsbury is 06070. FED. R. EVID. 201.\n\n                                                        39\n\fdefendants argue that “the mere possibility . . . that [Ms. Carter’s] school-age children may\n\npotentially earn a higher income in their mid-twenties if they move at some point to a lower-\n\npoverty area is entirely speculative and in no way imminent.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 34. The\n\nplaintiffs, however, identify “robust evidence that children who moved to lower-poverty areas\n\nwhen they were young (below age 13) are more likely to attend college,” to “have substantially\n\nhigher incomes as adults,” and to “live in better neighborhoods themselves as adults,” and are\n\n“less likely to become single parents.” Raj Chetty et al., The Effects of Exposure to Better\n\nNeighborhoods on Children: New Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity Experiment, 106\n\nAM . ECON. REV. 855, 899 (2016); see also LORA ENGDAHL, P OVERTY & RACE RES. ACTION\n\nCOUNCIL, NEW NEIGHBORHOODS, NEW SCHOOLS: A P ROGRESS REPORT ON THE BALTIM ORE\n\nHOUSING MOBILITY P ROGRAM 27–28 (2009) (finding that relocation to low-poverty areas\n\nproduces significant mental health benefits to Housing Choice Voucher holders); MARGERY\n\nAUSTIN TURNER & LYNETTE RAWLINGS, URBAN INST ., P ROM OTING NEIGHBORHOOD DIVERSITY:\n\nBENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND STRATEGIES 2 (2009) (describing the myriad ways “[n]eighborhoods\n\nmatter to the well-being of children and families.”). The weight of this research certainly\n\nindicates that Ms. Carter’s family may enjoy some additional benefits from living in Simsbury.\n\n       The defendants also argue that Ms. Carter has not “identified any imminent risk that she\n\nor her family will actually be subject to criminal activity in Hartford.” Defs.’ Opp’n at 34. This\n\narguments set the bar too high. “[A]s a preliminary injunction requires only a likelihood of\n\nirreparable injury, . . . Damocles’s sword does not have to actually fall . . . before the court will\n\nissue an injunction.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8–9. Irreparable harm can flow not\n\nonly from actual criminal victimization, but also from “continued exposure to [a] high crime rate\n\n. . . and unsafe conditions of [one’s] present community.” Bronson v. Crestwood Lake Section 1\n\n\n\n                                                  40\n\fHolding Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1468017\"><a href=\"/opinion/1468017/bronson-v-crestwood-lake-section-1-holding-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 153 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); see also ENGDAHL, supra, at 27\n\n(“Families in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at higher risk for disease and earlier death likely\n\ndue” in part to “the cumulative stress arising from living in unsafe neighborhoods with limited\n\nresources.”); TURNER & RAWLINGS, supra, at 3 (“Young people who live in high-crime areas are\n\nmore likely to commit crimes themselves.”).\n\n       The defendants observe that Ms. Carter has not “alleged that she has applied for housing\n\nin Simsbury, that if she did apply she would be likely to be selected despite competition from\n\nother applicants, or that there are sufficient landlords in Simsbury participating in the HCV\n\nprogram and accepting voucher-holding tenants including, in particular, her.” Defs.’ Opp’n at\n\n34. To apply for housing in Simsbury prior to the Rule’s implementation, however, would be\n\nfutile—the Rule’s premise is that voucher holders such as Ms. Carter cannot obtain housing in\n\nhigh-income areas like Simsbury because current payment standards do not suffice to make such\n\nhousing affordable. Ms. Carter has established that she intends to apply for and obtain such\n\nhousing as soon as she possibly can. Carter Decl. ¶¶ 6–7. A landlord’s discrimination against\n\nvoucher holders, moreover, would violate Connecticut law. See Con. Gen. Stat. § 46a-64c;\n\nComm’n on Human Rights & Opportunities v. Sullivan Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241 (Conn.\n\n1999). Furthermore, HUD’s own calculation, based on detailed housing market data, that an\n\nFMR of $1,940 will suffice to allow a voucher holder to rent a four-bedroom unit in Simsbury\n\nbelies HUD’s speculative assertion that such units may be unavailable to Ms. Carter even under\n\nthe Rule, see Defs.’ Opp’n at 34.\n\n       Finally, the defendants dispute that any expenses associated with Ms. Carter’s longer\n\ncommute would be sufficiently burdensome to warrant injunctive relief. Id. This argument\n\nmischaracterizes the nature of the harm that Ms. Carter’s family would suffer from her commute.\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\fThe relevant harm is not primarily an economic injury, but “the opportunity cost of spending\n\nhours on a bus instead of participating in after school activities, studying, and engaging in active\n\nplay.” Pls.’ Reply at 21.\n\n       2. Tiara Moore\n\n       Plaintiff Tiara Moore likewise has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to\n\nwarrant a preliminary injunction. Ms. Moore and her minor child live in an apartment in the City\n\nof Chicago, Illinois. Moore Decl. ¶ 1. The Chicago Housing Authority has issued Ms. Moore a\n\nHousing Choice Voucher for $1,207 per month for a two-bedroom unit. Id. ¶¶ 4, 7. Ms. Moore\n\nwishes to move to DuPage County, Illinois, to live in a neighborhood that will afford her family\n\ngreater employment opportunities, higher quality education, and a safer living environment, as\n\nwell as to be nearer to Ms. Moore’s mother, who provides child care so that Ms. Moore can\n\nwork. Id. ¶¶ 5–6. DuPage County’s poverty rate of 7.4 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. J, Poverty Data\n\nfor DuPage County, Ill., ECF No. 16-10, is also much lower than the poverty rate in Ms.\n\nMoore’s ZIP code, which is 33.8 percent, Pls.’ Decl., Ex. H, Poverty Data for 60644 ZIP Code,\n\nECF No 16-8. Ms. Moore has not, however, been able to locate any two-bedroom rental units in\n\nDuPage County for $1,207 per month. Id. ¶ 7. The Rule would enable Ms. Moore to move her\n\nfamily from the City of Chicago to DuPage County. For fiscal year 2018, the FMR for a two-\n\nbedroom unit in the broad Chicago metropolitan area, which includes DuPage County, would be\n\n$1,180 per month. Pls.’ Decl., Ex. C, Chicago FMRs at 1, ECF No. 16-3. In contrast, under the\n\nRule, 41 of DuPage County’s ZIP codes would have SAFMRs exceeding $1,180 per month, with\n\nSAFMRs in the highest-cost ZIP codes reaching $1,770 per month. Pls.’ Decl., Ex. D, 2018\n\nChicago SAFMRs, ECF No. 16-4. This difference in voucher purchasing power throughout\n\nmuch of DuPage County would dramatically improve Ms. Moore’s ability to find suitable\n\n\n\n                                                 42\n\fhousing there. In addition, Ms. Moore will, absent the Rule’s implementation, continue to incur\n\nopportunity and transportation costs arising from her daily trips to bring her child to and from her\n\nmother’s house for child care. Moore Decl. ¶ 6.\n\n        The defendants argue that Ms. Moore will suffer no injury from the Rule’s delay, as the\n\nRule would not benefit her in the first place. Defs.’ Opp’n at 35. The defendants observe that\n\nthe Chicago Housing Authority is a Moving to Work PHA and so would be exempt from use of\n\nSAFMRs even if the Rule were implemented. See id., Attach. 3, Decl. of Marianne Nazzaro ¶¶\n\n2–3, ECF No. 24-3; Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. at 80,578. Ms. Moore, however, seeks to move to\n\nDuPage County, not to Chicago. Moore Decl. ¶¶ 5–6, 9. The DuPage County PHA, not the\n\nChicago Housing Authority, sets payment standards for DuPage County, see 24 C.F.R. §\n\n982.503(a)(1) (providing that PHAs set payment standards for their own jurisdictions), and,\n\nunlike the Chicago Housing Authority, is not a Moving to Work PHA, see Moving to Work\n\n(MTW) - Participating Sites, U.S. DEP’T HOUSING & URBAN DEV.,\n\nhttps://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph/mtw/mtwsites (last\n\nvisited Dec. 23, 2017). The Rule’s implementation thus would benefit Ms. Moore. 17\n\n        3. OCA\n\n        Finally, Plaintiff OCA has demonstrated a risk of irreparable injury sufficient to warrant a\n\npreliminary injunction. An organization, to show irreparable harm, must show first that “the\n\n‘actions taken by the defendant have perceptibly impaired the organization’s programs.” League\n\nof Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8 (quoting Fair Emp’t Council of Greater Wash., Inc. v. BMC\n\nMktg. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673802\"><a href=\"/opinion/673802/fair-employment-council-of-greater-washington-inc-v-bmc-marketing/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1276 (D.C.

Defs.’ Opp’n at 34–35. The defendants’ arguments fail as to Ms. Moore for the same reason\nthey fail as to Ms. Carter.\n\n                                                        43\n\fthat the defendant’s actions ‘directly conflict with the organization’s mission.” Id. (quoting Nat’l\n\nTreasury Emps. Union v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"730972\"><a href=\"/opinion/730972/national-treasury-employees-union-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1430 (D.C. Cir. 1996)). “[O]bstacles\n\n[that] unquestionably make it more difficult for [an organization] to accomplish [its] primary\n\nmission . . . provide injury for purposes [of] . . . irreparable harm.” Id. at 9. OCA works “to\n\npromote access to opportunity,” including educational, employment, and housing opportunity,\n\n“for all people, and specifically to address the disproportionate isolation from opportunity\n\nexperienced by Blacks and Latinos in Connecticut due to residential segregation.” Pls.’ Mot.,\n\nAttach. 5, Decl. of Erin Boggs, Exec. Dir., OCA (“OCA Decl.”) ¶ 2, ECF No. 15-5. “OCA’s\n\ncentral focus in this work is leveraging affordable and subsidized housing programs to enable\n\nlow-income families to access housing outside of areas with concentrated poverty and\n\nsegregation.” Id. Much of this work involves enabling families who receive housing vouchers\n\nto move to higher-opportunity areas and addressing the concentration of voucher holders (who,\n\nin the Hartford area, primarily are nonwhite) in high-poverty, segregated areas. Id. ¶¶ 4–9. For\n\nexample, OCA works to improve housing mobility programs for voucher users and to increase\n\nthe supply of rental housing suitable for voucher holders in high-opportunity neighborhoods. Id.\n\n       OCA has shown that the Rule’s delay will “perceptibly impair[]” OCA’s programs and\n\n“directly conflict with the organization’s mission.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8. The\n\nRule’s delay frustrates OCA’s ability to assist voucher holders gain access to greater opportunity\n\nin several ways. First, the delay frustrates OCA’s “engage[ment] with . . . developers to\n\nencourage the acquisition and construction of housing that is affordable to voucher holders in\n\nnon-concentrated, high-opportunity areas in the Hartford metropolitan area,” because “[t]he\n\nanticipated income from voucher holders will not support financing of such development while\n\n[voucher] rents are being calculated on a metropolitan-wide basis, rather than with a small-area\n\n\n\n                                                 44\n\fcalculation.” OCA Decl. ¶ 8. OCA also has diverted scarce resources away from previously\n\nplanned projects to address HUD’s delay of the Rule. Id. ¶¶ 10–12. “With the suspension in\n\neffect,” OCA explains, “OCA will need to spend significant resources on research, outreach,\n\npublic education, and advocacy to implement small area market rents ‘voluntarily’ on a PHA-by-\n\nPHA basis across the Hartford metropolitan area, a multi-year effort that may ultimately prove\n\nfutile.” Id. ¶ 10. OCA has already changed its activities as a result of the Rule’s delay. For\n\nexample, OCA “planned to produce a Small Area Fair Market Rent web portal which would\n\nhave included (a) an analysis of the difference between SAFMRs and FMRs across the state, (b)\n\nan explanation of SAFMRs, (c) data on the current location of voucher holders, and (d) the\n\nresults of a time consuming rent study that highlighted the additional units that would become\n\navailable under the new rent calculation formula.” Id. ¶ 11. In light of the Rule’s delay, OCA is\n\n“now taking steps to revise the content of this portal and to instead produce an advocacy piece,\n\nbased on this data, explaining why the program freeze is detrimental.” Id. Finally, the Rule’s\n\ndelay has required OCA “to engage in further meetings and other communications with\n\nstakeholders to ensure that the impact of this policy suspension is fully understood” and to\n\n“spen[d] time conducting outreach to [OCA’s] coalition members to explain the freeze and its\n\nconsequences for voucher holders.” Id. ¶ 12.\n\n       The defendants assert that plaintiffs must show that OCA’s claimed monetary loss\n\n“threatens the very existence of the movant’s business” to support OCA’s claims of irreparable\n\neconomic injury. Defs.’ Opp’n at 36 (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"450359\"><a href=\"/opinion/450359/wisconsin-gas-company-v-federal-energy-regulatory-commission-michigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">669</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1985)). The defendants misread the authority on which they rely. Wisconsin Gas Co. held\n\nthat “[r]ecoverable monetary loss may constitute irreparable harm only where the loss threatens\n\nthe very existence of the movant’s business.” 758 F.2d at 674. OCA’s monetary losses,\n\n\n\n                                                45\n\fhowever, are not recoverable, as the APA provides no damages remedy. See 5 U.S.C. § 702\n\n(authorizing actions “seeking relief other than money damages”). Wisconsin Gas Go. thus is\n\ninapposite; to show irreparable harm, OCA need only show that HUD’s delay of the Rule will\n\n“perceptibly impair[]” OCA’s programs and “directly conflict with the organization’s mission.”\n\nLeague of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 8. For the reasons given, OCA has made such a showing.\n\n       C.      Balance of Equities and Public Interest\n\n       The third and fourth factors that courts consider in determining whether a preliminary\n\ninjunction is warranted are “a balance of the equities in [the plaintiffs’] favor, and accord with\n\nthe public interest.” Id. at 6 (quoting Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. FEC, 831 F.3d at 505). The\n\nharm the plaintiffs would suffer from the Rule’s delay is clear, for the reasons explained above.\n\nAs HUD’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, moreover, the Rule’s delay would leave in\n\nplace the 50th Percentile Rule, which the defendants recognize has failed to serve Section 8’s\n\ngoals. Hr’g Tr. at 17. The harms the defendants assert that voucher holders would suffer should\n\nHUD implement the Rule on schedule, in contrast, are wholly speculative because they presume\n\nthe Interim Report’s findings apply to Rule-affected areas, which, also for reasons explained\n\nearlier, the defendants have failed to show. The defendants, moreover, “cannot suffer harm from\n\nan injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” Rodriguez v. Robbins, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1145 (9th Cir. 2013); accord R.I.L-R v.

Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 (D.D.C. 2015) (same).\n\nThe balance of equities thus weighs in the plaintiffs’ favor. A preliminary injunction’s issuance\n\nalso would serve the public interest. “There is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of\n\nunlawful agency action.” League of Women Voters, 838 F.3d at 12. “To the contrary, there is a\n\nsubstantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws”—such as\n\nthe APA, as well as regulations such as § 888.113(c)(4)—“that govern their existence and\n\n\n\n                                                 46\n\foperations.” Id.

As such, the plaintiffs have met their burdens to show that the\n\nbalance of equities and consideration of the public interest support the injunctive relief they seek.\n\nIV.
