Deegear and\n\n\n     1\n      See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\fDeemaxx pled the affirmative defense of settlement and release and\n\ncounterclaimed for declaratory judgment. After a series of motions for summary\n\njudgment, the trial court entered a final judgment ordering that Kodiak take\n\nnothing by its claims and awarded declaratory relief and attorney’s fees to\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx. In four issues, Kodiak argues the trial court erred by (1)\n\ngranting Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion for traditional summary judgment on\n\ntheir settlement and release defense; (2) granting Deegear and Deemaxx’s no-\n\nevidence motion for summary judgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim; (3)\n\ngranting Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion for summary judgment on their\n\ncounterclaim for declaratory relief; and (4) awarding Deegear and Deemaxx trial\n\nand appellate attorney’s fees. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n                                      I.\n                                  Background\n\n      This appeal arises out of the second lawsuit between the parties. Kodiak\n\nmanufactures, assembles, and sells disc brakes and brake components to trailer\n\nmanufacturers, trailer parts distributors, trailer axle manufacturers, and trailer\n\ndealers across the country. Deegear began working at Kodiak as a part-time\n\nemployee in 1992. By 2004, Deegear was Kodiak’s president. He also sat on\n\nthe board of directors and owned fifty percent of Kodiak’s stock. As an employee\n\nand president of Kodiak, Deegear acquired knowledge of Kodiak’s trade secrets\n\nand confidential and proprietary information.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      In 2009, Deegear initiated negotiations with William Glidewell—Kodiak’s\n\nfounder, chief executive officer, and owner of the other fifty percent of Kodiak’s\n\nstock—to purchase Glidewell’s shares. According to Glidewell, Deegear made\n\nhim an “unfairly low offer” for his Kodiak shares and threatened to “take Kodiak’s\n\nemployees and customers and force Kodiak to liquidate if [Glidewell] wouldn’t\n\naccede to his demands.” Glidewell claims that he then learned that Deegear had\n\ncommitted corporate malfeasance, including misuse of corporate funds.         On\n\nAugust 17, 2009, Glidewell and Kodiak’s board of directors had Deegear\n\nescorted from Kodiak’s premises and began a formal ethics investigation into his\n\nactivities as president of Kodiak.      Glidewell claims Kodiak’s investigation\n\nrevealed that Deegear had breached his fiduciary duties to Kodiak, had failed to\n\nproperly report to the board of directors, had mismanaged key matters, had\n\nimproperly shared confidential information with third parties, had falsified\n\nexpense reports, had used company credit cards against company policy, and\n\nhad threatened to steal corporate employees, customers, and vendors to directly\n\ncompete with Kodiak and force it out of business.\n\n      In September 2009, Kodiak sued Deegear for breach of fiduciary duty,\n\nbreach of contract, theft, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Kodiak alleged,\n\namong other things, that Deegear had taken its trade secrets and was\n\nthreatening to take its “customers and vendors and open his own business to\n\ncompete with Kodiak.” Kodiak sought a temporary and permanent injunction to\n\n“restrain Deegear from using or disclosing or continuing to retain Kodiak’s\n\n                                        3\n\finformation” and to “restrain Deegear from directly competing with Kodiak for a\n\nperiod of at least a year.”\n\n      On November 19, 2009, the parties settled the lawsuit and executed a\n\nsettlement agreement with an effective date of October 5, 2009. Kodiak agreed\n\nto pay Deegear $330,000, and Deegear agreed to transfer all of his Kodiak stock\n\nto Kodiak and to resign. Kodiak and Deegear also agreed to release their claims\n\nagainst each other and to file a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice\n\nwithin five days of the execution of the settlement agreement. On December 9,\n\n2009, the trial court signed an order dismissing the suit with prejudice.\n\n      In   June    2010,      Deegear   formed   Deemaxx.      Deemaxx      designs,\n\nmanufactures, and sells disc brakes and brake components in the trailer industry\n\nand competes with Kodiak.         Kodiak claims that since 2010, it has received\n\nreports from vendors, distributors, customers, and others in the industry that\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx were trying to manufacture and sell rotors, brakes, and\n\nother components in competition with Kodiak that appeared to be based upon\n\ndrawings that were nearly identical to Kodiak’s drawings for similar components\n\nand parts. Some of Kodiak’s U.S. partners and distributors reported to Kodiak\n\nthat Deegear, acting through Deemaxx, was soliciting sales of competing\n\ncomponents and parts that appeared to be based on confidential information and\n\ndesigns that Deegear had and had access to while he was at Kodiak. One of\n\nDeemaxx’s representatives gave one of Kodiak’s customers a price sheet.\n\nKodiak customers and vendors also received Deemaxx brochures that described\n\n                                          4\n\fDeemaxx’s brakes and extolled their virtues and alleged advantages over similar\n\nKodiak products.    All of Kodiak’s larger customers and distributors reported\n\nreceiving repetitive calls from Deegear and Deemaxx trying to solicit business\n\naway from Kodiak. Deemaxx’s website contained pictures and descriptions of\n\nproducts similar to Kodiak’s products. Kodiak believed that Deemaxx’s brakes\n\nand other parts were based on engineering drawings that contained\n\ninformation—including    verbatim    instruction   notes—virtually   identical   to\n\ninformation contained in Kodiak’s drawings for the same parts.         And at the\n\nNational Association of Trailer Manufacturers annual trade show in February\n\n2011, Deegear and Deemaxx displayed three different disc brake sets that were\n\nidentical to Kodiak’s brakes.   Kodiak believed that these brakes were made\n\nbased upon drawings and information belonging to Kodiak that Deegear obtained\n\nwhile employed by Kodiak and that Deegear and Deemaxx had no right to use.\n\n      On April 6, 2011, Kodiak sued Deegear and Deemaxx, asserting claims for\n\nunfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information,\n\nviolation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and conversion. Kodiak also sought a\n\ntemporary and permanent injunction compelling Deegear and Deemaxx to return\n\nKodiak’s trade secrets or confidential information and to restrain Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx from any further acts of unfair competition against Kodiak and from\n\nusing or disclosing its trade secrets or confidential information. In their answer,\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx asserted several affirmative defenses, including prior\n\nsettlement and release based on the release language in the 2009 settlement\n\n                                        5\n\fagreement.    They also filed a counterclaim asserting breach of contract and\n\ntortious interference claims and seeking a declaratory judgment to determine the\n\nparties’ rights under the settlement agreement.\n\n      Deegear and Deemaxx filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a\n\ntraditional summary judgment on their prior settlement and release defense and\n\na no-evidence summary judgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim. The trial\n\ncourt granted Deegear and Deemaxx’s summary judgment motion on their\n\naffirmative defense with respect to Kodiak’s claims for misappropriation of trade\n\nsecrets and confidential information, violations of the Texas Theft Liability Act,\n\nand conversion. Deegear and Deemaxx supplemented their no-evidence motion\n\nfor summary judgment. The trial court granted the supplemental motion, thereby\n\ndisposing of all of Kodiak’s claims.\n\n      Deegear and Deemaxx filed a motion for traditional summary judgment on\n\ntheir declaratory judgment counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion and\n\ndeclared that the settlement agreement released Deegear and Deemaxx from all\n\nclaims asserted by Kodiak in the 2009 lawsuit and any claims or causes of action\n\nthat could be brought by Kodiak on or after October 5, 2009, whether or not such\n\nclaims or causes of action were connected in any way to Deegear’s relationship\n\nwith Kodiak. The trial court also granted Deegear and Deemaxx’s claims for\n\nattorney’s fees pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act and found that they\n\nwere entitled to recover attorney’s fees “in an amount to be determined.”\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f      By agreement of the parties, the issue of attorney’s fees was submitted to\n\nthe trial court by motions and affidavits. The trial court granted Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s request for attorney’s fees and entered a final judgment ordering that\n\nKodiak take nothing on its claims, declaring the parties’ rights under the\n\nsettlement agreement, and awarding Deegear and Deemaxx $215,559.62 in trial\n\nattorney’s fees and conditional appellate attorney’s fees of $60,000 if Kodiak\n\nunsuccessfully appealed the judgment to the court of appeals, $15,000 if Kodiak\n\nfiled a petition for review with the supreme court, $25,000 if the supreme court\n\nordered full briefing on the petition for review, and $20,000 if the supreme court\n\ngranted the petition for review. Kodiak appealed.\n\n                                     II.\n                             Standards of Review\n\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim,\n\n315 S.W.3d 860, 862 (Tex. 2010). We consider the evidence presented in the\n\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, crediting evidence favorable to the\n\nnonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding evidence contrary to the\n\nnonmovant unless reasonable jurors could not. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp\n\nAdvisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). We indulge every\n\nreasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the nonmovant’s favor. 20801,\n\nInc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 399 (Tex. 2008).         A plaintiff is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment on a cause of action if it conclusively proves all essential\n\nelements of the claim. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(a), (c); MMP, Ltd. v. Jones, 710\n\n\n                                        7\n\fS.W.2d 59, 60 (Tex. 1986). A defendant is entitled to summary judgment on an\n\naffirmative defense if the defendant conclusively proves all the elements of the\n\naffirmative defense. Frost Nat’l Bank v. Fernandez, 315 S.W.3d 494, 508–09\n\n(Tex. 2010); see Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(b), (c). To accomplish this, the defendant-\n\nmovant must present summary judgment evidence that conclusively establishes\n\neach element of the affirmative defense. See Chau v. Riddle, 254 S.W.3d 453,\n\n455 (Tex. 2008).\n\n      After an adequate time for discovery, the party without the burden of proof\n\nmay, without presenting evidence, move for summary judgment on the ground\n\nthat there is no evidence to support an essential element of the nonmovant’s\n\nclaim or defense. Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). The motion must specifically state the\n\nelements for which there is no evidence. Id.; Timpte Indus., Inc. v. Gish, 286\n\nS.W.3d 306, 310 (Tex. 2009). The trial court must grant the motion unless the\n\nnonmovant produces summary judgment evidence that raises a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i) & cmt.; Hamilton v. Wilson, 249 S.W.3d\n\n425, 426 (Tex. 2008).\n\n      When reviewing a no-evidence summary judgment, we examine the entire\n\nrecord in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, indulging every reasonable\n\ninference and resolving any doubts against the motion. Sudan v. Sudan, 199\n\nS.W.3d 291, 292 (Tex. 2006). We review a no-evidence summary judgment for\n\nevidence that would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to differ in their\n\nconclusions. Hamilton, 249 S.W.3d at 426 (citing City of Keller v. Wilson, 168\n\n                                       8\n\fS.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005)). We credit evidence favorable to the nonmovant if\n\nreasonable jurors could, and we disregard evidence contrary to the nonmovant\n\nunless reasonable jurors could not. Timpte Indus., 286 S.W.3d at 310 (quoting\n\nMack Trucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 582 (Tex. 2006)).                If the\n\nnonmovant brings forward more than a scintilla of probative evidence that raises\n\na genuine issue of material fact, then a no-evidence summary judgment is not\n\nproper. Smith v. O’Donnell, 288 S.W.3d 417, 424 (Tex. 2009); King Ranch, Inc.\n\nv. Chapman, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1030\n\n(2004).\n\n                                      III.\n                                    Analysis\n\nA.    Summary Judgment on Deegear and Deemaxx’s Affirmative Defense\n\n      In its first issue, Kodiak complains the trial court erred by granting Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s motion for summary judgment on their affirmative defense of\n\nsettlement and release. Specifically, Kodiak argues that summary judgment was\n\nimproper because (1) the settlement agreement specifically states that the\n\nparties were only releasing claims that arose “prior to, or at the time of, the\n\neffective date” of the settlement agreement and Kodiak’s claims in this lawsuit\n\narose after the effective date and (2) Deemaxx was not a party to the settlement\n\nagreement and did not exist when the settlement agreement was executed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      1.     Applicable Law\n\n      A release is an agreement or contract in which one party agrees that a\n\nlegal right or obligation owed by the other party is surrendered. Dresser Indus.,\n\nInc. v. Page Petroleum, Inc., 853 S.W.2d 505, 508 (Tex. 1993). It is subject to\n\nthe normal rules of contract construction, including the rules of ambiguity. Nat’l\n\nUnion Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., 955 S.W.2d 120, 127\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1997), aff’d, 20 S.W.3d 692 (Tex. 2000).           A\n\nrelease extinguishes a claim or cause of action and is an absolute bar to any\n\nright of action on the released matter. Dresser Indus., 853 S.W.2d at 508.\n\n      To release a claim effectively, the releasing instrument must “mention” the\n\nclaim to be released. Victoria Bank & Trust Co. v. Brady, 811 S.W.2d 931, 938\n\n(Tex. 1991); see Keck, Mahin & Cate v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh,\n\nPa., 20 S.W.3d 692, 698 (Tex. 2000).          Claims not clearly within the subject\n\nmatter of the release are not discharged, even if those claims exist when the\n\nrelease is executed. Keck, 20 S.W.3d at 698. It is not necessary, however, for\n\nthe parties to anticipate and explicitly identify every potential cause of action\n\nrelating to the subject matter of the release.      Id.   Although releases include\n\nclaims existing at the time of execution, they may also include unknown claims\n\nand damages that develop in the future. See id.\n\n      In construing a release, as with other contracts, the primary effort is to\n\nascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties to the release, considering\n\nthe instrument as a whole. Stafford v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., 175 S.W.3d 537, 541\n\n                                         10\n\f(Tex. App.—Texarkana 2005, no pet.) (reasoning that a contract must be read as\n\na whole rather than isolating a certain phrase, sentence, or section of the\n\nagreement).     The contract’s language is to be given its plain grammatical\n\nmeaning unless doing so would defeat the parties’ intent. Id. In determining\n\nintent, we must look to the contract, not what the parties allegedly meant. Union\n\nPac. R.R. v. Novus Int’l, Inc., 113 S.W.3d 418, 421 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 2003, pet. denied). An unambiguous contract will be enforced as written.\n\nDavid J. Sacks, P.C. v. Haden, 266 S.W.3d 447, 450 (Tex. 2008).\n\n      2.      Application\n\n      In their motion for summary judgment, Deegear and Deemaxx contended\n\nthat in the settlement agreement, Kodiak released them from the claims asserted\n\nin the 2011 lawsuit that arose from or related to the same factual bases, claims,\n\nand causes of action in the 2009 lawsuit. In the 2009 lawsuit, Kodiak alleged that\n\nas an employee and officer of Kodiak, Deegear had acquired knowledge of\n\nKodiak’s trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information, including, but\n\nnot limited to (1) its product development plans; (2) the limitations of its products;\n\n(3) its engineering designs and design concepts; (4) the technical data and\n\nspecifications of its products; (5) its product costs and pricing information; (6) its\n\nfinancial information; (7) the compensation levels it could and did offer its\n\nemployees and outside sales agents; (8) its business development plans; (9) its\n\nmarketing plans and strategy; and (10) information on its customer prospects and\n\non customer contacts. Kodiak alleged, among other things, that Deegear had\n\n                                         11\n\ftaken Kodiak’s trade secrets and was threatening to take Kodiak’s “customers\n\nand vendors and open his own business to compete with Kodiak.” Kodiak sought\n\na temporary and permanent injunction to “restrain Deegear from using or\n\ndisclosing or continuing to retain Kodiak’s information” and to “restrain Deegear\n\nfrom directly competing with Kodiak for a period of at least a year.”\n\n      The settlement agreement provided in relevant part as follows:\n\n             This SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made\n      effective as of October 5, 2009, (the “Effective Date”) by and\n      between Kodiak Products Co., Inc. (“Kodiak”)[,] William E. Glidewell\n      (“Glidewell”), Sylvia Hartless (“Hartless”)[,]2 and Charles H. Deegear,\n      Jr. (“Deegear”), and is entered into with the full consent and approval\n      of Deegear’s spouse.\n\n             ....\n\n              WHEREAS, the parties desire to resolve and settle these\n      disputes and finally and forever resolve all claims of any kind and\n      character relating to or arising from the events and allegations set\n      forth in the Lawsuit . . . .\n\n             ....\n\n            2.    Covenants by Kodiak: In consideration of these recitals\n      and the promises and agreements set forth in this Agreement, on\n      which the other parties hereto rely in agreeing to their covenants,\n      Kodiak agrees to perform the following:\n\n                    ....\n\n                    2.4 Release of Deegear:   Kodiak, for itself and\n                    anyone claiming through it or on its behalf,\n                    IRREVOCABLY       AND       UNCONDITIONALLY\n\n      2\n        Hartless was a third-party defendant in the 2009 lawsuit. The record does\nnot reflect the claims against her, but based upon the settlement agreement, it\nappears that she was aligned with Kodiak and Glidewell.\n\n                                         12\n\f                   RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER DISCHARGES\n                   Deegear, and anyone or any entity acting through or on\n                   his behalf, including without limitation any past, present,\n                   and future agents, employees, shareholders, directors,\n                   insurers, officers, heirs, administrators, executors,\n                   spouses, and attorneys, from any and all claims or\n                   causes of action whatsoever, whether known or\n                   unknown, whether accrued or unaccrued, and whether\n                   connected in any way with Deegear’s relationships with\n                   Kodiak, Glidewell, Hartless, or not, including, but not\n                   limited to, any claims or causes of action arising under\n                   contract, any law, common or statutory, that provides\n                   any sort of right, benefit, or cause of action that can be\n                   the subject of a release under applicable law, which\n                   may have arisen, or which may arise, prior to, or at the\n                   time of, the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\n      In the 2011 lawsuit, Kodiak alleged that “Deegear had and ha[s] access to\n\nKodiak’s trade secrets and confidential information only because he was\n\nemployed by Kodiak” and that “Deegear, following his resignation [from Kodiak],\n\nretained copies of documents and other things containing Kodiak’s [c]onfidential\n\n[i]nformation, including product specifications and designs, customer lists,\n\nvendors lists, vendor capabilities, vendor cost and pricing information, customer\n\nand product pricing information, customer purchase requirements, and marketing\n\nstrategies.”   Kodiak further alleged that Deegear and Deemaxx had\n\nmisappropriated Kodiak’s trade secrets and confidential information. Kodiak also\n\nasserted conversion and Texas Theft Liability Act claims against Deegear.\n\nKodiak sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Deegear from\n\nany further use or disclosure of Kodiak’s trade secrets or confidential information\n\nand compelling Deegear and Deemaxx to return any and all documents or other\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthings that contained Kodiak’s trade secrets or confidential information. Even\n\nthough the claims in the 2009 lawsuit differ from those asserted in the 2011\n\nlawsuit, both lawsuits arise from and relate to Deegear’s employment with Kodiak\n\nand the information he allegedly gained during his tenure at Kodiak.\n\n      Kodiak argues that because the settlement agreement’s release provisions\n\nonly released Deegear from claims or causes of action arising prior to October 5,\n\n2009, its claims in the 2011 lawsuit were not barred by the release. The release\n\nprovision in the settlement agreement is divided into two parts. The first part\n\nreads as follows:\n\n      2.4 Release of Deegear: Kodiak, for itself and anyone claiming\n      through     it    or  on    its   behalf,   IRREVOCABLY          AND\n      UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER\n      DISCHARGES Deegear, and anyone or any entity acting through or\n      on his behalf, including without limitation any past, present, and\n      future agents, employees, shareholders, directors, insurers, officers,\n      heirs, administrators, executors, spouses, and attorneys, from any\n      and all claims or causes of action whatsoever, whether known or\n      unknown, whether accrued or unaccrued, and whether connected in\n      any way with Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak, Glidewell,\n      Hartless, or not,\n\nAnd the second part states:\n\n      including, but not limited to, any claims or causes of action arising\n      under contract, any law, common or statutory, that provides any sort\n      of right, benefit, or cause of action that can be the subject of a\n      release under applicable law, which may have arisen, or which may\n      arise, prior to, or at the time of, the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n      [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fKodiak contends the underlined clause at the end of part two applies to all of\n\nparagraph 2.4, and therefore, the settlement agreement does not release claims\n\narising after the settlement agreement’s effective date.\n\n      Part one releases Deegear “from any and all claims or causes of action\n\nwhatsoever, whether known or unknown, whether accrued or unaccrued, and\n\nwhether connected in any way with Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak,\n\nGlidewell, Hartless, or not.”   This broad language releases Deegear from all\n\npossible claims, including future claims.       Kodiak contents that this broad\n\nlanguage is limited by part two. Part two, however, is illustrative, stating that the\n\nreleased claims include, but are not limited to, “any claims or causes of action\n\narising under contract, any law, common or statutory, that provides any sort of\n\nright, benefit, or cause of action that can be the subject of a release under\n\napplicable law.”\n\n      Under the “last antecedent” doctrine, the final clause of part two does not\n\nlimit the broad language of part one of paragraph 2.4. The “last antecedent”\n\ndoctrine is “a canon of contract and statutory construction” by which “‘relative and\n\nqualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases\n\nimmediately preceding, and are not to be construed as extending to or including\n\nothers more remote.’” Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London Subscribing to\n\nPolicy Number: FINFR0901509 v. Cardtronics, Inc., 438 S.W.3d 770, 782 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (op. on reh’g) (quoting Montanye v.\n\nTransamerica Ins. Co., 638 S.W.2d 518, 521 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.]\n\n                                         15\n\f1982, no writ)). “[M]odifiers are intended to refer to the words closest to them in\n\nthe sentence.” Samano v. Sun Oil Co., 621 S.W.2d 580, 581–82 (Tex. 1981).\n\nThus, in this case, the final clause refers back to the illustrative language in part\n\ntwo. It does not limit the broad release language in part one.\n\n      Next, Kodiak contends that because Deemaxx was not a party to the\n\nsettlement agreement and did not exist when the settlement agreement was\n\nexecuted, Kodiak did not release its claims against Deemaxx. Paragraph 2.4\n\napplies not only to Deegear, but to “anyone or any entity acting through or on his\n\nbehalf, including without limitation any past, present, and future agents,\n\nemployees, shareholders, directors, insurers, officers, heirs, administrators,\n\nexecutors, spouses, and attorneys.” This includes Deemaxx.\n\n      We conclude that paragraph 2.4 of the settlement agreement releases all\n\nof Kodiak’s claims against Deegear and Deemaxx, including those arising after\n\nthe effective date of the settlement agreement.          Therefore, Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx conclusively proved their affirmative defense as a matter of law, and\n\nthe trial court did not err by granting summary judgment with respect to Kodiak’s\n\nclaims for misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information,\n\nviolations of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and conversion.       Accordingly, we\n\noverrule Kodiak’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fB.    No-Evidence Summary Judgment on Kodiak’s Unfair Competition\n      Claim\n\n      By its second issue, Kodiak argues the trial court erred by granting\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim.          In support of its unfair\n\ncompetition claim, Kodiak alleged in paragraphs 42 and 43 of its first amended\n\npetition as follows:\n\n             42. Likewise, Deegear’s and Deemaxx’s false advertising\n      constitutes unfair competition. Deegear and Deemaxx make false\n      statements (on the internet and in marketing materials provided to\n      prospective customers and distributors) that: (a) their products are\n      the subject of pending patent applications; (b) their products are\n      unique compared to others in the industry, including Kodiak’s; and\n      (c) their products out-perform others in the industry, including\n      Kodiak’s.\n\n            43. Deegear and Deemaxx have made these statements on\n      the internet and in marketing materials provided to prospective\n      customers and distributors with the intent to deceive those\n      prospective customers and distributors (as well as the public,\n      generally) concerning the nature of their products, the patent\n      protection of their products, and their products’ relative performance.\n      These statements are also made with an intent that prospective\n      customers and distributors (as well as the public, generally) rely on\n      those statements when making decisions to purchase Deemaxx’s\n      products or to purchase competitors’ products (including Kodiak’s).\n\n      In their supplemental no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx characterized Kodiak’s claim as a false advertising claim under the\n\nLanham Act and argued that there was no evidence to support the claim. See 15\n\nU.S.C.A. § 1125(a)(1)(B) (West 2009) (“Any person who . . . in commercial\n\nadvertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or\n\n\n                                        17\n\fgeographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or\n\ncommercial activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes\n\nthat he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.”). Kodiak specially\n\nexcepted to Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion, arguing that the motion’s grounds\n\nwere unclear and ambiguous because Deegear and Deemaxx challenged a\n\ncause of action that Kodiak had not pled.\n\n      Kodiak argues that the trial court erred in granting Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment for three reasons. First,\n\nthe trial court erred in overruling Kodiak’s special exceptions.3 Second, Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s motion, which asserted there was no evidence of a false\n\nadvertising claim under the Lanham Act, erroneously challenged a claim not\n\nasserted by Kodiak.      Third, notwithstanding the label placed on Kodiak’s\n\nallegations in its first amended petition, it presented sufficient evidence to raise\n\ngenuine issues of material fact that precluded the granting of summary judgment.\n\nWe address each of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The record does not show that the trial court ruled on Kodiak’s special\nexceptions, but by granting Deegear and Deemaxx’s no-evidence motion, it\nimplicitly overruled Kodiak’s special exceptions. See Fieldteck Avionics &\nInstruments, Inc. v. Component Control.Com, Inc., 262 S.W.3d 813, 824 n.3 (Tex\nApp.—Fort Worth 2008, no pet.) (“[A] trial court implicitly overrules special\nexceptions when it grants summary judgment on the motion to which the special\nexceptions pertain.”).\n\n                                        18\n\f      1.      Kodiak’s special exceptions\n\n      Kodiak argued in its special exceptions that Deegear and Deemaxx’s\n\nsupplemental no-evidence motion was unclear and ambiguous because (1) it\n\nwas premised on the erroneous assumption that Kodiak asserted a false\n\nadvertising claim under the Lanham Act and (2) Deegear and Deemaxx did not\n\naddress the actual grounds upon which Kodiak’s unfair competition claim was\n\nbased—Deegear and Deemaxx’s misappropriation of Kodiak’s designs for disc\n\nbrake and brake components and their false statements about their products on\n\nthe Internet and in marketing materials. Kodiak asserts that the trial court should\n\nhave sustained Kodiak’s special exceptions and required Deegear and Deemaxx\n\nto redraft their no-evidence motion.\n\n      In summary judgment proceedings, special exceptions are intended to\n\nensure that the parties and the court are focused on the same grounds. See\n\nMcConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 342–43 (Tex. 1993).\n\nThe trial court has broad discretion in ruling on special exceptions, and its ruling\n\nwill not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Alejandro v. Bell, 84 S.W.3d\n\n383, 389 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, no pet.). Even though Kodiak did not\n\nagree with the summary-judgment grounds alleged in Deegear and Deemaxx’s\n\nmotion, the grounds were clear from the motion. Thus, we conclude that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by implicitly overruling Kodiak’s special\n\nexceptions.\n\n\n\n                                        19\n\f      2.     Deegear and Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for\n             summary judgment\n\n      Kodiak argues alternatively that the trial court erred in granting Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n\nbecause the motion was fatally defective in that it raised a no-evidence ground\n\non the presumption that Kodiak had pled a false advertising cause of action\n\nunder the Lanham Act.      In the further alternative, Kodiak argues that if we\n\nconclude that it alleged a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act or that\n\nthe elements of a Lanham Act claim are common to Kodiak’s unfair competition\n\nclaim, the trial court erred in granting the motion because Kodiak presented\n\nsufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the elements\n\nchallenged by Deegear and Deemaxx.\n\n      Kodiak contends that its unfair competition claim as pled in paragraphs 42\n\nand 43 arose under the Texas common law, not the Lanham Act. “The law of\n\nunfair competition is the umbrella for all statutory and nonstatutory causes of\n\naction arising out of business conduct which is contrary to honest practice in\n\nindustrial or commercial matters.”   U.S. Sporting Prods., Inc. v. Johnny Stewart\n\nGame Calls, Inc., 865 S.W.2d 214, 217 (Tex. App.—Waco 1993, writ denied)\n\n(quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 494 F.2d 3, 14 (5th\n\nCir. 1974)). Unfair competition includes a number of types of objectionable trade\n\npractices,   including   trademark    infringement,   dilution   of   good    will,\n\nmisappropriation of business value, palming off, passing off, and theft of trade\n\n\n                                        20\n\fsecrets. Healthpoint, Ltd. v. River’s Edge Pharms., LLC, No. SA-03-CV-984-RF,\n\n2005 WL 356839, at *3 (W.D. Tex. Feb. 14, 2005); U.S. Sporting Prods., 865\n\nS.W.2d at 217. Unfair competition requires that the plaintiff show an illegal act by\n\nthe defendant that interfered with the plaintiff’s ability to conduct its business.\n\nSchoellkopf v. Pledger, 778 S.W.2d 897, 904–05 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1989, writ\n\ndenied). The illegal act need not necessarily violate criminal law, but it must at\n\nleast be an independent tort.       Id. (“Without some finding of an independent\n\nsubstantive tort or other illegal conduct, we hold that liability cannot be premised\n\non the tort of ‘unfair competition.’”).\n\n      In support of its unfair competition claim, Kodiak alleged that Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx engaged in false advertising.          As pointed out by Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx in their summary judgment reply and on appeal, Texas does not\n\nrecognize a common law false advertising claim.           See VendEver LLC v.\n\nIntermatic Mfg. Ltd., No. 3:11-CV-201-B, 2011 WL 4346324, at *4, n.4 (N.D. Tex.\n\nSept. 16, 2011) (“It is unclear whether there is in fact a common law cause of\n\naction for false advertising under Texas law.”); see also Charles M. Hosch,\n\nBusiness Torts, 65 SMU L. Rev. 315, 328 (2012) (“The [VendEver] court’s point\n\nwas well taken because there really is no such cause of action as ‘common law\n\nfalse advertising’ in Texas or in many other states.”).         Additionally, false\n\nadvertising claims are different from unfair competition claims. “[I]n the former\n\ncase, the defendant makes no secret of the origin of the goods in himself, but\n\nmerely misrepresents certain qualities or characteristics that his goods may or\n\n                                          21\n\fmay not have; in the latter case, the defendant misrepresents his goods to be\n\nthose of another.” Chevron Chem. Co. v. Voluntary Purchasing Grps., Inc., 659\n\nF.2d 695, 701 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\n      Thus, we construe Kodiak’s unfair competition claim as a claim for false\n\nadvertising in violation of the Lanham Act. See Healthpoint, Ltd. v. Ethex Corp.,\n\nNo. SA-01-CA-646-OG, 2004 WL 2359420, at *9 (W.D. Tex. July 14, 2004)\n\n(“Healthpoint’s allegations in support of its claim of common law unfair\n\ncompetition are those also alleged for false advertising in violation of the Lanham\n\nAct. Accordingly, the claim for common law unfair competition will be analyzed\n\nunder the elements of the claim of false advertising in violation of the Lanham\n\nAct.”); see also Healthpoint, Ltd. v. Allen Pharm., LLC, No. SA-07-CA-0526-XR,\n\n2008 WL 728333, at *4 (W.D. Tex. Mar. 18, 2008) (finding common law unfair\n\ncompetition claim in false advertising case dependent on Lanham Act false\n\nadvertising claim and analyzing such claim under the elements of the Lanham\n\nAct). To establish liability for false advertising under the Lanham Act, the plaintiff\n\nmust show that (1) the defendant made a false statement of fact about its product\n\nin a commercial advertisement; (2) the statement actually deceived or has a\n\ntendency to deceive a substantial segment of its audience; (3) the deception is\n\nlikely to influence a purchasing decision; (4) the defendant caused the false\n\nstatement to enter interstate commerce; and (5) the plaintiff has been or is likely\n\nto be injured as a result. Astoria Indus. of Iowa, Inc. v. SNF, Inc., 223 S.W.3d\n\n616, 629–30 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2007, pet. denied) (op. on reh’g).\n\n                                         22\n\f      In their supplemental no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx alleged there was no evidence to support any of the elements of\n\nKodiak’s false advertising claim. Thus, Kodiak was required to bring forward\n\nevidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on each element. See Tex. R.\n\nCiv. P. 166a(i). Kodiak, however, failed to bring forward any evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of fact that Deegear and Deemaxx’s alleged deception was likely\n\nto influence a purchasing decision.\n\n      Additionally, Kodiak failed to present more than a scintilla of probative\n\nevidence that it was or is likely to be injured as a result of Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s alleged false statements. Kodiak attached to its response an affidavit\n\nfrom Christopher Martinez, its damages expert. Martinez stated that Kodiak’s\n\nannual sales during its fiscal years 2006 through 2010 trended in a manner\n\nsimilar to personal expenditures for durable goods, but after Deemaxx entered\n\nthe market in March 2011, Kodiak’s sales during fiscal year 2011 fell, even\n\nthough personal expenditures for durable goods continued to rise.       Martinez\n\nfurther stated that Kodiak’s sales fell in fiscal year 2012 and trended downward\n\nthrough August 2012. Based on the assumption that Kodiak’s sales would have\n\ncontinued to trend in a manner similar to personal expenditures for durable\n\ngoods but for Deegear and Deemaxx’s acts, Martinez calculated that Kodiak\n\nwould have realized additional revenues of $1,956,326 from March 1, 2011,\n\nthough August 31, 2012, and, based upon these lost revenues, calculated that\n\nKodiak suffered $524,524 in lost profits. There was no evidence, however, that\n\n                                       23\n\fDeemaxx’s entry into the market caused the drop in Kodiak’s sales. In fact,\n\nMartinez expressly stated that “[f]or the purpose of assessing the extent of\n\npotential damages, I have assumed that the observed decline in Kodiak’s sales\n\nbeginning in March 2011 is attributable to the alleged acts of [Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx].”\n\n      Kodiak argues that Martinez’s assumption is supported by Glidewell’s\n\naffidavit testimony and that together, their affidavit testimony raises genuine\n\nissues of material fact that Deegear and Deemaxx caused or were likely to cause\n\nKodiak harm. Glidewell testified that Deegear and Deemaxx were attempting to\n\nsolicit business away from Kodiak; were trying to manufacture and sell rotors,\n\nbrakes, and other components to compete with Kodiak’s products; had created\n\nand distributed marketing materials to Kodiak’s customers and vendors\n\npromoting Deemaxx’s brakes over Kodiak’s brakes; and were targeting Kodiak’s\n\ncustomers, distributors, and vendors. This testimony, however, is insufficient to\n\nsupport Martinez’s assumption that the decline in Kodiak’s sales is attributable to\n\nDeegear’s and Deemaxx’s acts. Nor is it sufficient on its own to raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact that Kodiak was or is likely to be injured as a result of\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx’s alleged false advertising. Thus, the trial court did not\n\nerr by granting Deegear and Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim. We overrule Kodiak’s\n\nsecond issue.\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\fC.    Summary Judgment on Deegear and Deemaxx’s Counterclaim for\n      Declaratory Judgment\n\n      In its third issue, Kodiak argues the trial court erred in granting Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim for\n\ndeclaratory relief because the counterclaim was improperly used to recover\n\nattorney’s fees on disputes already pending before the trial court. Kodiak argues\n\nin its fourth issue that because declaratory relief was improper as matter of law,\n\nthe trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees to Deegear and Deemaxx under\n\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009\n\n(West 2015) (“In any proceeding under this chapter, the court may award costs\n\nand reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.”).\n\nKodiak also challenges the attorney’s fees on the ground that Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx failed to segregate their fees.\n\n      1.     Applicable Law\n\n      A counterclaim for declaratory judgment is improper if it is nothing more\n\nthan a mere denial of the plaintiff’s claims and the counterclaim fails to have\n\ngreater ramifications than the original suit. BHP Petroleum Co. v. Millard, 800\n\nS.W.2d 838, 842 (Tex. 1990) (orig. proceeding). To have “greater ramifications”\n\nthan the original suit, the counterclaim should seek some sort of affirmative relief.\n\nHECI Exploration Co. v. Clajon Gas Co., 843 S.W.2d 622, 638–39 (Tex.

Jock, 717 S.W.2d 654, 657 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Waco 1986, writ ref’d n.r.e.)).\n\n      Even though the Declaratory Judgment Act permits a trial court to “award\n\ncosts and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just,”\n\nTex.

However, “a counterclaim\n\nbrought under the Declaratory Judgment Act presenting no new controversies\n\nbut brought solely to pave an avenue to attorney’s fees is improper.” Id. at 770.\n\n      2.    Application\n\n      In their motion for summary judgment on their declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim, Deegear and Deemaxx asked the trial court to “declare the rights\n\n                                        26\n\fand duties of the parties as they relate to the contractual release between plaintiff\n\nand defendants” and argued they were entitled to declaratory relief as to “the\n\nconstruction and validity of the release in the [s]ettlement [a]greement not only as\n\nit applies to Kodiak’s current claims by [sic] potential future claims by Kodiak.”\n\nThe trial court granted Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion and entered a declaration\n\nthat Kodiak, in the settlement agreement,\n\n      fully released Deegear from any claims or causes of action\n      (including those asserted herein) that could be brought by Kodiak\n      against Deegear on or after October 5, 2009, whether or not such\n      claims or causes of action are connected in any way to Deegear’s\n      relationships with Kodiak [and]\n\n             . . . fully released anyone or any entity acting through or on\n      Deegear’s behalf from any claims or causes of action (including\n      those asserted herein) that could be brought by Kodiak against such\n      person or entity on or after October 5, 2009, whether or not such\n      claims or causes of action are connected in any way to Deegear’s\n      relationships with Kodiak, and Kodiak has thereby fully release[d]\n      Deemaxx from such claims.\n\n      Deegear and Deemaxx argue that the declaratory relief requested had\n\ngreater ramifications than Kodiak’s lawsuit and sought affirmative relief because\n\nthe trial court declared that paragraph 2.4 of the settlement agreement released\n\n(1) claims that did not arise from Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak, (2) claims\n\nagainst nonparties acting through or on Deegear’s behalf, and (3) future claims\n\nthat may be asserted after the conclusion of this litigation. But their request for\n\ndeclaratory relief was nothing more than a restatement of their affirmative\n\ndefense and had no greater ramifications than Kodiak’s claims. As discussed\n\nabove, Deegear and Deemaxx sought summary judgment on their affirmative\n\n                                         27\n\fdefense of settlement and release based upon paragraph 2.4 of the settlement\n\nagreement, which stated that Kodiak released Deegear from claims “whether\n\nconnected in any way with Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak . . . or not” and\n\n“anyone or any entity acting through or on his behalf.” They also argued that\n\nKodiak released them from future claims. In substance, Deegear and Deemaxx’s\n\nrequested declarations are identical to the basis for their affirmative defense.\n\nSee HECI Exploration, 843 S.W.2d at 639.            The declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim does not allege a cause of action independent from Kodiak’s claim\n\non which Deegear and Deemaxx could recover relief if Kodiak abandoned its\n\ncause of action. See BHP Petroleum, 800 S.W.2d at 842; HECI Exploration, 843\n\nS.W.2d at 639.     Deegear and Deemaxx asked for no greater relief in their\n\ndeclaratory judgment counterclaim than they asked for without the counterclaim.\n\nSee HECI Exploration, 843 S.W.2d at 639. Accordingly, we conclude that as a\n\nmatter of law, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s declaratory judgment counterclaim and abused its discretion in\n\nawarding them attorney’s fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act. We sustain\n\nKodiak’s third and fourth issues.\n\n                                       IV.\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We overrule Kodiak’s first and second issues. Having sustained Kodiak’s\n\nthird and fourth issues, we reverse the trial court’s judgment as to Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s declaratory judgment counterclaim and the award of attorney’s fees,\n\n\n                                       28\n\fand we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.4 See Tex. R. App. P. 43.2(d). We affirm the remainder of the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment. See Tex. R. App. P. 43.2(a).\n\n\n\n                                                  /s/ Anne Gardner\n                                                  ANNE GARDNER\n                                                  JUSTICE\n\nPANEL: DAUPHINOT, GARDNER, and WALKER, JJ.\n\nDELIVERED: June 4, 2015\n\n\n\n\n      4\n        When, as here, only one party moves for summary judgment and an\nappellate court reverses that summary judgment, the case must be remanded to\nthe trial court.

Deegear and\n\n\n     1\n      See Tex. R. App. P. 47.4.\n\fDeemaxx pled the affirmative defense of settlement and release and\n\ncounterclaimed for declaratory judgment. After a series of motions for summary\n\njudgment, the trial court entered a final judgment ordering that Kodiak take\n\nnothing by its claims and awarded declaratory relief and attorney’s fees to\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx. In four issues, Kodiak argues the trial court erred by (1)\n\ngranting Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion for traditional summary judgment on\n\ntheir settlement and release defense; (2) granting Deegear and Deemaxx’s no-\n\nevidence motion for summary judgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim; (3)\n\ngranting Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion for summary judgment on their\n\ncounterclaim for declaratory relief; and (4) awarding Deegear and Deemaxx trial\n\nand appellate attorney’s fees. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n\n                                      I.\n                                  Background\n\n      This appeal arises out of the second lawsuit between the parties. Kodiak\n\nmanufactures, assembles, and sells disc brakes and brake components to trailer\n\nmanufacturers, trailer parts distributors, trailer axle manufacturers, and trailer\n\ndealers across the country. Deegear began working at Kodiak as a part-time\n\nemployee in 1992. By 2004, Deegear was Kodiak’s president. He also sat on\n\nthe board of directors and owned fifty percent of Kodiak’s stock. As an employee\n\nand president of Kodiak, Deegear acquired knowledge of Kodiak’s trade secrets\n\nand confidential and proprietary information.\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\f      In 2009, Deegear initiated negotiations with William Glidewell—Kodiak’s\n\nfounder, chief executive officer, and owner of the other fifty percent of Kodiak’s\n\nstock—to purchase Glidewell’s shares. According to Glidewell, Deegear made\n\nhim an “unfairly low offer” for his Kodiak shares and threatened to “take Kodiak’s\n\nemployees and customers and force Kodiak to liquidate if [Glidewell] wouldn’t\n\naccede to his demands.” Glidewell claims that he then learned that Deegear had\n\ncommitted corporate malfeasance, including misuse of corporate funds.         On\n\nAugust 17, 2009, Glidewell and Kodiak’s board of directors had Deegear\n\nescorted from Kodiak’s premises and began a formal ethics investigation into his\n\nactivities as president of Kodiak.      Glidewell claims Kodiak’s investigation\n\nrevealed that Deegear had breached his fiduciary duties to Kodiak, had failed to\n\nproperly report to the board of directors, had mismanaged key matters, had\n\nimproperly shared confidential information with third parties, had falsified\n\nexpense reports, had used company credit cards against company policy, and\n\nhad threatened to steal corporate employees, customers, and vendors to directly\n\ncompete with Kodiak and force it out of business.\n\n      In September 2009, Kodiak sued Deegear for breach of fiduciary duty,\n\nbreach of contract, theft, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Kodiak alleged,\n\namong other things, that Deegear had taken its trade secrets and was\n\nthreatening to take its “customers and vendors and open his own business to\n\ncompete with Kodiak.” Kodiak sought a temporary and permanent injunction to\n\n“restrain Deegear from using or disclosing or continuing to retain Kodiak’s\n\n                                        3\n\finformation” and to “restrain Deegear from directly competing with Kodiak for a\n\nperiod of at least a year.”\n\n      On November 19, 2009, the parties settled the lawsuit and executed a\n\nsettlement agreement with an effective date of October 5, 2009. Kodiak agreed\n\nto pay Deegear $330,000, and Deegear agreed to transfer all of his Kodiak stock\n\nto Kodiak and to resign. Kodiak and Deegear also agreed to release their claims\n\nagainst each other and to file a joint motion to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice\n\nwithin five days of the execution of the settlement agreement. On December 9,\n\n2009, the trial court signed an order dismissing the suit with prejudice.\n\n      In   June    2010,      Deegear   formed   Deemaxx.      Deemaxx      designs,\n\nmanufactures, and sells disc brakes and brake components in the trailer industry\n\nand competes with Kodiak.         Kodiak claims that since 2010, it has received\n\nreports from vendors, distributors, customers, and others in the industry that\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx were trying to manufacture and sell rotors, brakes, and\n\nother components in competition with Kodiak that appeared to be based upon\n\ndrawings that were nearly identical to Kodiak’s drawings for similar components\n\nand parts. Some of Kodiak’s U.S. partners and distributors reported to Kodiak\n\nthat Deegear, acting through Deemaxx, was soliciting sales of competing\n\ncomponents and parts that appeared to be based on confidential information and\n\ndesigns that Deegear had and had access to while he was at Kodiak. One of\n\nDeemaxx’s representatives gave one of Kodiak’s customers a price sheet.\n\nKodiak customers and vendors also received Deemaxx brochures that described\n\n                                          4\n\fDeemaxx’s brakes and extolled their virtues and alleged advantages over similar\n\nKodiak products.    All of Kodiak’s larger customers and distributors reported\n\nreceiving repetitive calls from Deegear and Deemaxx trying to solicit business\n\naway from Kodiak. Deemaxx’s website contained pictures and descriptions of\n\nproducts similar to Kodiak’s products. Kodiak believed that Deemaxx’s brakes\n\nand other parts were based on engineering drawings that contained\n\ninformation—including    verbatim    instruction   notes—virtually   identical   to\n\ninformation contained in Kodiak’s drawings for the same parts.         And at the\n\nNational Association of Trailer Manufacturers annual trade show in February\n\n2011, Deegear and Deemaxx displayed three different disc brake sets that were\n\nidentical to Kodiak’s brakes.   Kodiak believed that these brakes were made\n\nbased upon drawings and information belonging to Kodiak that Deegear obtained\n\nwhile employed by Kodiak and that Deegear and Deemaxx had no right to use.\n\n      On April 6, 2011, Kodiak sued Deegear and Deemaxx, asserting claims for\n\nunfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information,\n\nviolation of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and conversion. Kodiak also sought a\n\ntemporary and permanent injunction compelling Deegear and Deemaxx to return\n\nKodiak’s trade secrets or confidential information and to restrain Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx from any further acts of unfair competition against Kodiak and from\n\nusing or disclosing its trade secrets or confidential information. In their answer,\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx asserted several affirmative defenses, including prior\n\nsettlement and release based on the release language in the 2009 settlement\n\n                                        5\n\fagreement.    They also filed a counterclaim asserting breach of contract and\n\ntortious interference claims and seeking a declaratory judgment to determine the\n\nparties’ rights under the settlement agreement.\n\n      Deegear and Deemaxx filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a\n\ntraditional summary judgment on their prior settlement and release defense and\n\na no-evidence summary judgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim. The trial\n\ncourt granted Deegear and Deemaxx’s summary judgment motion on their\n\naffirmative defense with respect to Kodiak’s claims for misappropriation of trade\n\nsecrets and confidential information, violations of the Texas Theft Liability Act,\n\nand conversion. Deegear and Deemaxx supplemented their no-evidence motion\n\nfor summary judgment. The trial court granted the supplemental motion, thereby\n\ndisposing of all of Kodiak’s claims.\n\n      Deegear and Deemaxx filed a motion for traditional summary judgment on\n\ntheir declaratory judgment counterclaim. The trial court granted the motion and\n\ndeclared that the settlement agreement released Deegear and Deemaxx from all\n\nclaims asserted by Kodiak in the 2009 lawsuit and any claims or causes of action\n\nthat could be brought by Kodiak on or after October 5, 2009, whether or not such\n\nclaims or causes of action were connected in any way to Deegear’s relationship\n\nwith Kodiak. The trial court also granted Deegear and Deemaxx’s claims for\n\nattorney’s fees pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act and found that they\n\nwere entitled to recover attorney’s fees “in an amount to be determined.”\n\n\n\n                                        6\n\f      By agreement of the parties, the issue of attorney’s fees was submitted to\n\nthe trial court by motions and affidavits. The trial court granted Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s request for attorney’s fees and entered a final judgment ordering that\n\nKodiak take nothing on its claims, declaring the parties’ rights under the\n\nsettlement agreement, and awarding Deegear and Deemaxx $215,559.62 in trial\n\nattorney’s fees and conditional appellate attorney’s fees of $60,000 if Kodiak\n\nunsuccessfully appealed the judgment to the court of appeals, $15,000 if Kodiak\n\nfiled a petition for review with the supreme court, $25,000 if the supreme court\n\nordered full briefing on the petition for review, and $20,000 if the supreme court\n\ngranted the petition for review. Kodiak appealed.\n\n                                     II.\n                             Standards of Review\n\n      We review a summary judgment de novo. Travelers Ins. Co. v.

Summary Judgment on Deegear and Deemaxx’s Affirmative Defense\n\n      In its first issue, Kodiak complains the trial court erred by granting Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s motion for summary judgment on their affirmative defense of\n\nsettlement and release. Specifically, Kodiak argues that summary judgment was\n\nimproper because (1) the settlement agreement specifically states that the\n\nparties were only releasing claims that arose “prior to, or at the time of, the\n\neffective date” of the settlement agreement and Kodiak’s claims in this lawsuit\n\narose after the effective date and (2) Deemaxx was not a party to the settlement\n\nagreement and did not exist when the settlement agreement was executed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f      1.

Application\n\n      In their motion for summary judgment, Deegear and Deemaxx contended\n\nthat in the settlement agreement, Kodiak released them from the claims asserted\n\nin the 2011 lawsuit that arose from or related to the same factual bases, claims,\n\nand causes of action in the 2009 lawsuit. In the 2009 lawsuit, Kodiak alleged that\n\nas an employee and officer of Kodiak, Deegear had acquired knowledge of\n\nKodiak’s trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information, including, but\n\nnot limited to (1) its product development plans; (2) the limitations of its products;\n\n(3) its engineering designs and design concepts; (4) the technical data and\n\nspecifications of its products; (5) its product costs and pricing information; (6) its\n\nfinancial information; (7) the compensation levels it could and did offer its\n\nemployees and outside sales agents; (8) its business development plans; (9) its\n\nmarketing plans and strategy; and (10) information on its customer prospects and\n\non customer contacts. Kodiak alleged, among other things, that Deegear had\n\n                                         11\n\ftaken Kodiak’s trade secrets and was threatening to take Kodiak’s “customers\n\nand vendors and open his own business to compete with Kodiak.” Kodiak sought\n\na temporary and permanent injunction to “restrain Deegear from using or\n\ndisclosing or continuing to retain Kodiak’s information” and to “restrain Deegear\n\nfrom directly competing with Kodiak for a period of at least a year.”\n\n      The settlement agreement provided in relevant part as follows:\n\n             This SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”) is made\n      effective as of October 5, 2009, (the “Effective Date”) by and\n      between Kodiak Products Co., Inc. (“Kodiak”)[,] William E. Glidewell\n      (“Glidewell”), Sylvia Hartless (“Hartless”)[,]2 and Charles H. Deegear,\n      Jr. (“Deegear”), and is entered into with the full consent and approval\n      of Deegear’s spouse.\n\n             ....\n\n              WHEREAS, the parties desire to resolve and settle these\n      disputes and finally and forever resolve all claims of any kind and\n      character relating to or arising from the events and allegations set\n      forth in the Lawsuit . . . .\n\n             ....\n\n            2.    Covenants by Kodiak: In consideration of these recitals\n      and the promises and agreements set forth in this Agreement, on\n      which the other parties hereto rely in agreeing to their covenants,\n      Kodiak agrees to perform the following:\n\n                    ....\n\n                    2.4 Release of Deegear:   Kodiak, for itself and\n                    anyone claiming through it or on its behalf,\n                    IRREVOCABLY       AND       UNCONDITIONALLY\n\n      2\n        Hartless was a third-party defendant in the 2009 lawsuit. The record does\nnot reflect the claims against her, but based upon the settlement agreement, it\nappears that she was aligned with Kodiak and Glidewell.\n\n                                         12\n\f                   RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER DISCHARGES\n                   Deegear, and anyone or any entity acting through or on\n                   his behalf, including without limitation any past, present,\n                   and future agents, employees, shareholders, directors,\n                   insurers, officers, heirs, administrators, executors,\n                   spouses, and attorneys, from any and all claims or\n                   causes of action whatsoever, whether known or\n                   unknown, whether accrued or unaccrued, and whether\n                   connected in any way with Deegear’s relationships with\n                   Kodiak, Glidewell, Hartless, or not, including, but not\n                   limited to, any claims or causes of action arising under\n                   contract, any law, common or statutory, that provides\n                   any sort of right, benefit, or cause of action that can be\n                   the subject of a release under applicable law, which\n                   may have arisen, or which may arise, prior to, or at the\n                   time of, the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n\n      In the 2011 lawsuit, Kodiak alleged that “Deegear had and ha[s] access to\n\nKodiak’s trade secrets and confidential information only because he was\n\nemployed by Kodiak” and that “Deegear, following his resignation [from Kodiak],\n\nretained copies of documents and other things containing Kodiak’s [c]onfidential\n\n[i]nformation, including product specifications and designs, customer lists,\n\nvendors lists, vendor capabilities, vendor cost and pricing information, customer\n\nand product pricing information, customer purchase requirements, and marketing\n\nstrategies.”   Kodiak further alleged that Deegear and Deemaxx had\n\nmisappropriated Kodiak’s trade secrets and confidential information. Kodiak also\n\nasserted conversion and Texas Theft Liability Act claims against Deegear.\n\nKodiak sought temporary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Deegear from\n\nany further use or disclosure of Kodiak’s trade secrets or confidential information\n\nand compelling Deegear and Deemaxx to return any and all documents or other\n\n\n                                        13\n\fthings that contained Kodiak’s trade secrets or confidential information. Even\n\nthough the claims in the 2009 lawsuit differ from those asserted in the 2011\n\nlawsuit, both lawsuits arise from and relate to Deegear’s employment with Kodiak\n\nand the information he allegedly gained during his tenure at Kodiak.\n\n      Kodiak argues that because the settlement agreement’s release provisions\n\nonly released Deegear from claims or causes of action arising prior to October 5,\n\n2009, its claims in the 2011 lawsuit were not barred by the release. The release\n\nprovision in the settlement agreement is divided into two parts. The first part\n\nreads as follows:\n\n      2.4 Release of Deegear: Kodiak, for itself and anyone claiming\n      through     it    or  on    its   behalf,   IRREVOCABLY          AND\n      UNCONDITIONALLY RELEASES, ACQUITS AND FOREVER\n      DISCHARGES Deegear, and anyone or any entity acting through or\n      on his behalf, including without limitation any past, present, and\n      future agents, employees, shareholders, directors, insurers, officers,\n      heirs, administrators, executors, spouses, and attorneys, from any\n      and all claims or causes of action whatsoever, whether known or\n      unknown, whether accrued or unaccrued, and whether connected in\n      any way with Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak, Glidewell,\n      Hartless, or not,\n\nAnd the second part states:\n\n      including, but not limited to, any claims or causes of action arising\n      under contract, any law, common or statutory, that provides any sort\n      of right, benefit, or cause of action that can be the subject of a\n      release under applicable law, which may have arisen, or which may\n      arise, prior to, or at the time of, the Effective Date of this Agreement.\n      [Emphasis added.]\n\n\n\n\n                                         14\n\fKodiak contends the underlined clause at the end of part two applies to all of\n\nparagraph 2.4, and therefore, the settlement agreement does not release claims\n\narising after the settlement agreement’s effective date.\n\n      Part one releases Deegear “from any and all claims or causes of action\n\nwhatsoever, whether known or unknown, whether accrued or unaccrued, and\n\nwhether connected in any way with Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak,\n\nGlidewell, Hartless, or not.”   This broad language releases Deegear from all\n\npossible claims, including future claims.       Kodiak contents that this broad\n\nlanguage is limited by part two. Part two, however, is illustrative, stating that the\n\nreleased claims include, but are not limited to, “any claims or causes of action\n\narising under contract, any law, common or statutory, that provides any sort of\n\nright, benefit, or cause of action that can be the subject of a release under\n\napplicable law.”\n\n      Under the “last antecedent” doctrine, the final clause of part two does not\n\nlimit the broad language of part one of paragraph 2.4. The “last antecedent”\n\ndoctrine is “a canon of contract and statutory construction” by which “‘relative and\n\nqualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases\n\nimmediately preceding, and are not to be construed as extending to or including\n\nothers more remote.’” Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London Subscribing to\n\nPolicy Number: FINFR0901509 v.

It does not limit the broad release language in part one.\n\n      Next, Kodiak contends that because Deemaxx was not a party to the\n\nsettlement agreement and did not exist when the settlement agreement was\n\nexecuted, Kodiak did not release its claims against Deemaxx. Paragraph 2.4\n\napplies not only to Deegear, but to “anyone or any entity acting through or on his\n\nbehalf, including without limitation any past, present, and future agents,\n\nemployees, shareholders, directors, insurers, officers, heirs, administrators,\n\nexecutors, spouses, and attorneys.” This includes Deemaxx.\n\n      We conclude that paragraph 2.4 of the settlement agreement releases all\n\nof Kodiak’s claims against Deegear and Deemaxx, including those arising after\n\nthe effective date of the settlement agreement.          Therefore, Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx conclusively proved their affirmative defense as a matter of law, and\n\nthe trial court did not err by granting summary judgment with respect to Kodiak’s\n\nclaims for misappropriation of trade secrets and confidential information,\n\nviolations of the Texas Theft Liability Act, and conversion.       Accordingly, we\n\noverrule Kodiak’s first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\fB.    No-Evidence Summary Judgment on Kodiak’s Unfair Competition\n      Claim\n\n      By its second issue, Kodiak argues the trial court erred by granting\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim.          In support of its unfair\n\ncompetition claim, Kodiak alleged in paragraphs 42 and 43 of its first amended\n\npetition as follows:\n\n             42. Likewise, Deegear’s and Deemaxx’s false advertising\n      constitutes unfair competition. Deegear and Deemaxx make false\n      statements (on the internet and in marketing materials provided to\n      prospective customers and distributors) that: (a) their products are\n      the subject of pending patent applications; (b) their products are\n      unique compared to others in the industry, including Kodiak’s; and\n      (c) their products out-perform others in the industry, including\n      Kodiak’s.\n\n            43. Deegear and Deemaxx have made these statements on\n      the internet and in marketing materials provided to prospective\n      customers and distributors with the intent to deceive those\n      prospective customers and distributors (as well as the public,\n      generally) concerning the nature of their products, the patent\n      protection of their products, and their products’ relative performance.\n      These statements are also made with an intent that prospective\n      customers and distributors (as well as the public, generally) rely on\n      those statements when making decisions to purchase Deemaxx’s\n      products or to purchase competitors’ products (including Kodiak’s).\n\n      In their supplemental no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx characterized Kodiak’s claim as a false advertising claim under the\n\nLanham Act and argued that there was no evidence to support the claim. See 15\n\nU.S.C.A. § 1125(a)(1)(B) (West 2009) (“Any person who . . . in commercial\n\nadvertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or\n\n\n                                        17\n\fgeographic origin of his or her or another person’s goods, services, or\n\ncommercial activities, shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes\n\nthat he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.”). Kodiak specially\n\nexcepted to Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion, arguing that the motion’s grounds\n\nwere unclear and ambiguous because Deegear and Deemaxx challenged a\n\ncause of action that Kodiak had not pled.\n\n      Kodiak argues that the trial court erred in granting Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s no-evidence motion for summary judgment for three reasons. First,\n\nthe trial court erred in overruling Kodiak’s special exceptions.3 Second, Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s motion, which asserted there was no evidence of a false\n\nadvertising claim under the Lanham Act, erroneously challenged a claim not\n\nasserted by Kodiak.      Third, notwithstanding the label placed on Kodiak’s\n\nallegations in its first amended petition, it presented sufficient evidence to raise\n\ngenuine issues of material fact that precluded the granting of summary judgment.\n\nWe address each of these arguments in turn.\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        The record does not show that the trial court ruled on Kodiak’s special\nexceptions, but by granting Deegear and Deemaxx’s no-evidence motion, it\nimplicitly overruled Kodiak’s special exceptions.

Kodiak’s special exceptions\n\n      Kodiak argued in its special exceptions that Deegear and Deemaxx’s\n\nsupplemental no-evidence motion was unclear and ambiguous because (1) it\n\nwas premised on the erroneous assumption that Kodiak asserted a false\n\nadvertising claim under the Lanham Act and (2) Deegear and Deemaxx did not\n\naddress the actual grounds upon which Kodiak’s unfair competition claim was\n\nbased—Deegear and Deemaxx’s misappropriation of Kodiak’s designs for disc\n\nbrake and brake components and their false statements about their products on\n\nthe Internet and in marketing materials. Kodiak asserts that the trial court should\n\nhave sustained Kodiak’s special exceptions and required Deegear and Deemaxx\n\nto redraft their no-evidence motion.\n\n      In summary judgment proceedings, special exceptions are intended to\n\nensure that the parties and the court are focused on the same grounds.

Deegear and Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for\n             summary judgment\n\n      Kodiak argues alternatively that the trial court erred in granting Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n\nbecause the motion was fatally defective in that it raised a no-evidence ground\n\non the presumption that Kodiak had pled a false advertising cause of action\n\nunder the Lanham Act.      In the further alternative, Kodiak argues that if we\n\nconclude that it alleged a false advertising claim under the Lanham Act or that\n\nthe elements of a Lanham Act claim are common to Kodiak’s unfair competition\n\nclaim, the trial court erred in granting the motion because Kodiak presented\n\nsufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the elements\n\nchallenged by Deegear and Deemaxx.\n\n      Kodiak contends that its unfair competition claim as pled in paragraphs 42\n\nand 43 arose under the Texas common law, not the Lanham Act. “The law of\n\nunfair competition is the umbrella for all statutory and nonstatutory causes of\n\naction arising out of business conduct which is contrary to honest practice in\n\nindustrial or commercial matters.”   U.S. Sporting Prods., Inc. v.

Thus, Kodiak was required to bring forward\n\nevidence raising a genuine issue of material fact on each element. See Tex. R.\n\nCiv. P. 166a(i). Kodiak, however, failed to bring forward any evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of fact that Deegear and Deemaxx’s alleged deception was likely\n\nto influence a purchasing decision.\n\n      Additionally, Kodiak failed to present more than a scintilla of probative\n\nevidence that it was or is likely to be injured as a result of Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s alleged false statements. Kodiak attached to its response an affidavit\n\nfrom Christopher Martinez, its damages expert. Martinez stated that Kodiak’s\n\nannual sales during its fiscal years 2006 through 2010 trended in a manner\n\nsimilar to personal expenditures for durable goods, but after Deemaxx entered\n\nthe market in March 2011, Kodiak’s sales during fiscal year 2011 fell, even\n\nthough personal expenditures for durable goods continued to rise.       Martinez\n\nfurther stated that Kodiak’s sales fell in fiscal year 2012 and trended downward\n\nthrough August 2012. Based on the assumption that Kodiak’s sales would have\n\ncontinued to trend in a manner similar to personal expenditures for durable\n\ngoods but for Deegear and Deemaxx’s acts, Martinez calculated that Kodiak\n\nwould have realized additional revenues of $1,956,326 from March 1, 2011,\n\nthough August 31, 2012, and, based upon these lost revenues, calculated that\n\nKodiak suffered $524,524 in lost profits. There was no evidence, however, that\n\n                                       23\n\fDeemaxx’s entry into the market caused the drop in Kodiak’s sales. In fact,\n\nMartinez expressly stated that “[f]or the purpose of assessing the extent of\n\npotential damages, I have assumed that the observed decline in Kodiak’s sales\n\nbeginning in March 2011 is attributable to the alleged acts of [Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx].”\n\n      Kodiak argues that Martinez’s assumption is supported by Glidewell’s\n\naffidavit testimony and that together, their affidavit testimony raises genuine\n\nissues of material fact that Deegear and Deemaxx caused or were likely to cause\n\nKodiak harm. Glidewell testified that Deegear and Deemaxx were attempting to\n\nsolicit business away from Kodiak; were trying to manufacture and sell rotors,\n\nbrakes, and other components to compete with Kodiak’s products; had created\n\nand distributed marketing materials to Kodiak’s customers and vendors\n\npromoting Deemaxx’s brakes over Kodiak’s brakes; and were targeting Kodiak’s\n\ncustomers, distributors, and vendors. This testimony, however, is insufficient to\n\nsupport Martinez’s assumption that the decline in Kodiak’s sales is attributable to\n\nDeegear’s and Deemaxx’s acts. Nor is it sufficient on its own to raise a genuine\n\nissue of material fact that Kodiak was or is likely to be injured as a result of\n\nDeegear and Deemaxx’s alleged false advertising. Thus, the trial court did not\n\nerr by granting Deegear and Deemaxx’s supplemental no-evidence motion for\n\nsummary judgment on Kodiak’s unfair competition claim. We overrule Kodiak’s\n\nsecond issue.\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\fC.    Summary Judgment on Deegear and Deemaxx’s Counterclaim for\n      Declaratory Judgment\n\n      In its third issue, Kodiak argues the trial court erred in granting Deegear\n\nand Deemaxx’s motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim for\n\ndeclaratory relief because the counterclaim was improperly used to recover\n\nattorney’s fees on disputes already pending before the trial court. Kodiak argues\n\nin its fourth issue that because declaratory relief was improper as matter of law,\n\nthe trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees to Deegear and Deemaxx under\n\nthe Declaratory Judgment Act. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009\n\n(West 2015) (“In any proceeding under this chapter, the court may award costs\n\nand reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.”).\n\nKodiak also challenges the attorney’s fees on the ground that Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx failed to segregate their fees.\n\n      1.

Application\n\n      In their motion for summary judgment on their declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim, Deegear and Deemaxx asked the trial court to “declare the rights\n\n                                        26\n\fand duties of the parties as they relate to the contractual release between plaintiff\n\nand defendants” and argued they were entitled to declaratory relief as to “the\n\nconstruction and validity of the release in the [s]ettlement [a]greement not only as\n\nit applies to Kodiak’s current claims by [sic] potential future claims by Kodiak.”\n\nThe trial court granted Deegear and Deemaxx’s motion and entered a declaration\n\nthat Kodiak, in the settlement agreement,\n\n      fully released Deegear from any claims or causes of action\n      (including those asserted herein) that could be brought by Kodiak\n      against Deegear on or after October 5, 2009, whether or not such\n      claims or causes of action are connected in any way to Deegear’s\n      relationships with Kodiak [and]\n\n             . . . fully released anyone or any entity acting through or on\n      Deegear’s behalf from any claims or causes of action (including\n      those asserted herein) that could be brought by Kodiak against such\n      person or entity on or after October 5, 2009, whether or not such\n      claims or causes of action are connected in any way to Deegear’s\n      relationships with Kodiak, and Kodiak has thereby fully release[d]\n      Deemaxx from such claims.\n\n      Deegear and Deemaxx argue that the declaratory relief requested had\n\ngreater ramifications than Kodiak’s lawsuit and sought affirmative relief because\n\nthe trial court declared that paragraph 2.4 of the settlement agreement released\n\n(1) claims that did not arise from Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak, (2) claims\n\nagainst nonparties acting through or on Deegear’s behalf, and (3) future claims\n\nthat may be asserted after the conclusion of this litigation. But their request for\n\ndeclaratory relief was nothing more than a restatement of their affirmative\n\ndefense and had no greater ramifications than Kodiak’s claims. As discussed\n\nabove, Deegear and Deemaxx sought summary judgment on their affirmative\n\n                                         27\n\fdefense of settlement and release based upon paragraph 2.4 of the settlement\n\nagreement, which stated that Kodiak released Deegear from claims “whether\n\nconnected in any way with Deegear’s relationships with Kodiak . . . or not” and\n\n“anyone or any entity acting through or on his behalf.” They also argued that\n\nKodiak released them from future claims. In substance, Deegear and Deemaxx’s\n\nrequested declarations are identical to the basis for their affirmative defense.\n\nSee HECI Exploration, 843 S.W.2d at 639.            The declaratory judgment\n\ncounterclaim does not allege a cause of action independent from Kodiak’s claim\n\non which Deegear and Deemaxx could recover relief if Kodiak abandoned its\n\ncause of action. See BHP Petroleum, 800 S.W.2d at 842; HECI Exploration, 843\n\nS.W.2d at 639.     Deegear and Deemaxx asked for no greater relief in their\n\ndeclaratory judgment counterclaim than they asked for without the counterclaim.\n\nSee HECI Exploration, 843 S.W.2d at 639. Accordingly, we conclude that as a\n\nmatter of law, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s declaratory judgment counterclaim and abused its discretion in\n\nawarding them attorney’s fees under the Declaratory Judgment Act. We sustain\n\nKodiak’s third and fourth issues.\n\n                                       IV.\n                                    Conclusion\n\n      We overrule Kodiak’s first and second issues. Having sustained Kodiak’s\n\nthird and fourth issues, we reverse the trial court’s judgment as to Deegear and\n\nDeemaxx’s declaratory judgment counterclaim and the award of attorney’s fees,\n\n\n                                       28\n\fand we remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.4 See Tex.
