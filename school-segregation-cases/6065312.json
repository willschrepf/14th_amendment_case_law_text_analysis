We REVERSE in\npart, AFFIRM in part, and REMAND for entry of judgment.\n                         I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nA. Factual Background\n       This case involves a dispute between Stelluti Kerr, L.L.C. (SK) and\nMapei Corporation (Mapei) over the Arovac, a machine used to package the\ncement-based powders that, when mixed with water, become the mortars and\ngrouts used in tile installation.          Historically, these powders have been\npackaged in paper bags, which are prone to leaking and breaking open. The\nArovac, however, packages these powders in plastic bags, which are less prone\nto leak and break. The Arovac is manufactured by Arodo BVBA (Arodo), a\nBelgian company.\n       In early 2006, SK and Arodo entered into an agreement for SK to\ndistribute the Arovac in North America on a non-exclusive basis (the\nDistributorship Agreement).          The Distributorship Agreement was for an\nindefinite duration. At the time, the Arovac was only a prototype, but the\nparties believed the Arovac would soon be perfected and decided to exhibit the\nplastic bags that the prototype was producing at a trade show in May 2006.\nMapei, a Florida-based manufacturer of (among other things) cement-based\ntile adhesives, saw the plastic bags at that show and was immediately\ninterested. 1 Mapei had recently lost a major multi-million dollar contract with\na big-box retailer, which had contracted with a competitor using a cleaner bag\nthan Mapei. To win back that contract, Mapei was actively searching for a\ncleaner package, which Mapei believed the Arovac could ultimately produce.\n\n\n\n       1Although Mapei is based in Florida, it is one of several wholly owned subsidiaries of\nMapei, S.P.A., a privately owned company based in Italy.\n                                             2\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n      SK and Mapei agree that, after their introduction at the 2006 trade\nshow, they formed a contract, but do not agree on much beyond that, including\nwhether the contract was for the sale of one Arovac or 14 Arovacs. Accordingly,\nthe facts underlying the formation of the parties’ contract require a close\nrecounting.\n      1. The Price Quotation Request and the “Gentlemen’s Agreement” on\n         Exclusivity\n      After the 2006 trade show, Mapei invited SK to attend an August\nmeeting at its headquarters with the steering committee tasked with winning\nback its lost contract with the big-box retailer. The attendees agree that Mapei\nrequested SK’s best price quote for one Arovac and that a “gentlemen’s\nagreement” was reached on exclusivity for the Arovac, pursuant to which SK\nwould not sell the Arovac to Mapei’s competitors in North America. The exact\ncontours of the agreement, however, are disputed. According to SK, it could\nnot commit to exclusivity without Arodo’s consent, so the “gentlemen’s\nagreement” was merely that SK would not sell the Arovac to Mapei’s\ncompetitors while the three parties worked out a more definite agreement on\nexclusivity. But according to Mapei, the “gentlemen’s agreement” was that SK\nwould not sell the Arovac to Mapei’s competitors and, in exchange, Mapei\nwould not buy packaging machines from SK’s competitors. Yet Mapei was not\ncommitted to buy, and would not buy, more than an initial pilot Arovac without\na new contract from the big-box retailer.\n      After the meeting, Arodo consented to an exclusive arrangement\nbetween SK and Mapei for distribution of the Arovac.          Arodo’s consent,\nhowever, was conditioned upon Mapei committing to purchase a certain\n(unspecified) number of machines.           Between August and October, SK\nrequested on several different occasions that Mapei disclose the number of\nArovacs that Mapei was committed to purchase to obtain exclusivity.          In\n\n                                       3\n\f                                No. 16-10430\nNovember, SK, still without a number from Mapei, sent Mapei the price\nquotation for one Arovac it requested. The quotation was highly detailed,\ntotaling nearly fifty pages in length. Page 38 of the quotation included a\nprovision captioned “Exclusivity,” which stated that, “[i]f the first machine\noperates as specified in this order, Mapei agrees to a commitment to purchase\na pre-determined quantity of AROVAC machines exclusively from SK . . . ,\nwhich must be specified at time of order and SK will grant Mapei exclusivity\nto the AROVAC bag for its industry (cement based tile adhesives).”\n      Mapei responded to the price quotation with a letter of intent to SK in\nDecember, expressing Mapei’s desire to purchase one Arovac “on a trial basis\nper your quotation” and requesting “every effort to deliver” the Arovac by May\n1, 2007. Mapei viewed the letter as evincing an intent to buy a single pilot\nmachine for demonstration to the big-box retailer, which it could scale up if\n(and only if) it obtained a written commitment from the retailer. But SK\nviewed the letter of intent consistent with a commitment from Mapei to buy a\ncertain (unspecified) number of machines because Mapei’s commitment was\ncontingent on the first Arovac—still only a prototype—working.\n      2. The Production Delays and Division\n      On March 17, 2007, SK, Arodo, and Mapei had a meeting where they\ndiscussed several design issues with the Arovac and agreed that Mapei would\nwork with SK to finalize engineering details by the end of the month. They\nalso discussed delivery dates for several Arovacs and agreed to divide delivery\ninto essentially two phases. The first phase involved a commitment by SK and\nArodo to deliver an initial Arovac to Mapei by December 2007—seven months\nafter the date initially requested by Mapei—with a commitment to deliver\nthree additional machines by February 2008.       The second phase involved\ndelivery of a quantity of subsequent machines to be later specified by Mapei.\nWhile all sides agree that this division occurred, they offer competing reasons\n                                      4\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nfor it. In SK’s view, the division was Mapei’s response to Arodo’s demand for\na commitment to purchase a number of machines as the Arovac prototype\nneared perfection, lest SK and Arodo begin to market the Arovac to others. But\nin Mapei’s view, the division was SK and Arodo’s attempt to mitigate the\ndamage that their delays in perfecting the prototype Arovac caused Mapei—\nnamely, thwarting its efforts to obtain a new contract with the big-box retailer\nand pushing back delivery dates for any subsequent machines Mapei might\nneed in order to scale up in the event it obtained that contract.\n       3. The Beginning of the CapEx Process and the Price Quotation\n       On May 1, 2007, Mapei requested that SK provide “specific items, most\nof which are machine dimensions, drawings, delivery dates, and other contract\nspecifics . . . to submit the CapEx[ 2] for internal approval.” The next day, Mapei\nrequested that SK submit a revised price quotation to reflect the finalized\nengineering details and a more detailed cost structure to “allow [Mapei] to\nprocure this equipment for all our North American plant operations where this\nequipment is applicable (approximately 12-15 machines).”\n       As SK prepared its revised price quotation, SK pressed Mapei to specify\nthe number of Arovacs that Mapei intended to purchase for delivery in phase\ntwo. SK also pressed Mapei to ensure that Mapei’s purchase order specified\nthe quantity of subsequent machines.                “If the guarantee for subsequent\nmachine[s] is not included in your [purchase order],” SK wrote, “Mapei shall\nnot obtain exclusivity.” On May 14th, Mapei informed SK that “it is a little too\n\n\n\n       2“CapEx” refers to Mapei’s internal capital expenditure process. Under that process,\nonce a price quotation like SK’s is received, the quotation and supporting documentation\n(such as drawings and specifications) are attached to a form describing the project and its\nprojected economic costs and benefits to obtain various approvals. If a project is over €10,000,\napproval must be obtained from Mapei’s United States CapEx team as well as Dr. Giorgio\nSquinzi, the chief executive officer, chairman, and majority shareholder of Mapei’s Italian\nparent company. Only after all the necessary approvals are obtained may a purchase order\nbe issued.\n                                               5\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nsoon to give you a final answer [on the number of Arovacs] since we need\napproval from our Italian colleagues[ 3],” but “if you want a number th[e]n you\ncan put down 2/quarter, assuming again that the equipment will perform as\nplanned.” The next day SK submitted its revised price quotation to Mapei.\nThe revised price quotation’s exclusivity provision (the 13-Arovac exclusivity\nprovision) stated that “[i]f the first machine operates as specified in this order,\nMapei agrees and is committed to purchase [13] subsequent machines” (i.e.,\nthe three Arovacs slated for delivery in February, plus ten subsequent\nmachines delivered at a rate of two machines per quarter during 2008 and\n2009).\n      Less than a week later, on May 21, Mapei asked SK to make a handful\nof changes, all technical in nature, to SK’s revised price quotation. Three of\nthe requested changes are on the same page on which the exclusivity provision\nis located. But Mapei did not request any change to that provision. On June\n4, SK sent Mapei a second revised price quotation “per [Mapei’s] comments”\n(the Price Quotation). The Price Quotation contained an exclusivity provision\nthat, other than being limited to North America (the area covered by SK’s\nDistributorship Agreement with Mapei), was in all material respects identical\nto the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision in the initial revised price quotation. A\nweek after submitting the Price Quotation, SK inquired as to the status of a\npurchase order from Mapei and was advised that “the owner of the\ncompany . . . will review the CapEx and as soon as this is done, we will issue\nthe [purchase order].”\n      4. The CapEx Approval and Mapei-SK Purchase Order\n      As the Price Quotation made its way through Mapei’s CapEx process,\nMapei noticed the quantities for several pieces of optional equipment to be\n\n\n      3   This was apparently a reference to Dr. Squinzi.\n                                              6\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\nincluded with the Arovac were wrong and notified SK. SK agreed that the\nquantity for those pieces of equipment would need to change from one to two,\nand advised Mapei that the changes would increase the Arovac’s total price by\nless than 2%, from €709,090 to €722,440. With SK’s agreement on the “exact\noptional equipment” and on “final pricing,” CapEx was “fully approved” on\nJune 21. On June 22, Mapei issued a purchase order for one Arovac and two\nof each of the discussed pieces of optional equipment (the Mapei-SK Purchase\nOrder). The Mapei-SK Purchase Order was “based on” the Price Quotation,\nbut was much shorter in length and omitted many of the provisions included\nin the Price Quotation, including the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision. Similar\nto Mapei’s letter of intent, the Mapei-SK Purchase Order for only one Arovac\nwas not necessarily inconsistent with the Price Quotation’s 13-Arovac\nexclusivity provision because that provision was contingent on the first Arovac\nworking.\n      5. The Initial SK-Arodo Purchase Order\n      After receiving the Mapei-SK Purchase Order, SK submitted its own\npurchase order to Arodo for the first Arovac on June 24. Similar to the Price\nQuotation, SK’s purchase order included a provision captioned “Exclusivity,”\nwhich stated that, “[i]f the first machine operates as specified in this order, SK\nagrees to purchase [13] subsequent machines” and “Arodo will grant SK\nexclusivity [as distributor] . . . for Mapei’s industry, specifically cement based\ntile adhesives,” in North America.\n      6. The Order Confirmation and Mapei-SK Purchase Order Revision\n      The following day, June 25, SK submitted an order confirmation to\nMapei (the Order Confirmation). The Order Confirmation listed the price of\nthe Arovac (with optional equipment) as €722,440, and included an exclusivity\nprovision that was in all material respects the same as the 13-Arovac\nexclusivity provision in the Price Quotation.\n                                        7\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\n      Mapei issued a revised purchase order to SK to reflect an updated Euro\nconversion rate on June 26 and made the first of several payments to SK for\nthe single prototype Arovac the next day.\n      7. The Arovac Installation and Subsequent SK-Arodo Purchase Orders\n      Over the succeeding months, the parties worked to finalize the design\nand delivery of the four phase-one Arovacs slated for delivery in December\n2007 and February 2008. In November 2007, the parties conducted a test of\nthe first Arovac at Arodo’s Belgium plant, which was mostly successful, and\nthe machine was shipped to Mapei. After the test, the parties agreed to delay\ndelivery dates for the three other Arovacs (machine 2 was scheduled for\ndelivery in April and machines 3 and 4 were scheduled for delivery in June)\nand agreed that Mapei would place a down payment for those machines by\nFebruary 15. The parties also discussed, but failed to agree on, a request by\nMapei for an expanded exclusive arrangement beyond cement-based tile\nadhesives.\n      The first Arovac was installed and accepted by Mapei in January 2008,\nand on February 11, SK sent Arodo a purchase order for the three remaining\nphase-one machines (together with the June 24 purchase order, the SK-Arodo\nPurchase Orders). 4 The February 11 purchase order contained an exclusivity\nprovision similar to the one contained in the June 24 purchase order.\n      8. Mapei’s Requests to Delay Subsequent Machines\n      Shortly thereafter, Mapei sought and obtained several extensions for\ndown payment on the three remaining phase-one machines. The stated reason\nfor the extensions was that Mapei had only ordered one Arovac and down\npayments or purchase orders for additional Arovacs could not be made or\n\n\n      4 Mapei made several revisions to the February 11 purchase order, the latest revision\nbeing March 28. We do not, however, separately address those revisions because neither\nparty contends they are material to our analysis.\n                                            8\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\nplaced until a new contract was reached with the big-box retailer. Mapei\nsought and obtained the first extension from SK, but requested subsequent\nextensions directly from Arodo. At the same time, Mapei requested that Arodo\nestablish an exclusive arrangement directly with it covering additional product\nsegments beyond cement-based tile adhesives.\n      In May, SK, Arodo, and Mapei had a meeting, during which Mapei\nrenewed its request for an expanded exclusive arrangement beyond cement-\nbased tile adhesives.   When the parties began to discuss the number of\nadditional Arovacs that Mapei would need to commit to buy to obtain that\nexclusivity, the discussion quickly became very confrontational. SK took the\nposition that any number less than 13 Arovacs over two years was a request to\nabandon an existing agreement on exclusivity for one with worse terms, while\nMapei took the position that it had only issued a purchase order for a single\nArovac and, thus, was not committed to purchase any additional Arovacs.\n      SK responded to the meeting with a May 29 letter from its attorney to\nMapei proposing an “amendment to the [parties’] agreement under which\nMapei would purchase a minimum of nine . . . additional machines over the\nnext three . . . years” in exchange for an exclusive arrangement covering more\nthan just cement-based tile adhesives. The letter also stated that it served as\nSK’s last request for a down payment on machines two through four, which\nwere in production. Two days later, on May 31, Mapei reiterated that it could\nnot make any down payments or submit any additional purchase orders until\nit had a written agreement with the big-box retailer it had lost several years\nago, which it hoped to do soon.\n      Soon after, without any payment from Mapei, Arodo demanded that SK\nmake a down payment on the three remaining phase-one Arovacs that were in\nproduction, which SK did.\n\n\n                                       9\n\f                                No. 16-10430\n      9. Mapei’s Purchase of Subsequent Machines from Arodo\n      On June 13, 2008, Mapei obtained a new contract with the big-box\nretailer that it had lost several years before. Three days later, on June 16,\nMapei informed SK that, in view of the recent communications from SK and\nits attorney (which Mapei claims were threats by SK to sue it), it would limit\nsubsequent communication to Arodo or through the parties’ legal counsel.\nLater that same day, Mapei renewed its discussions with Arodo over an\nexclusive arrangement directly between them.         A “key point” of that\narrangement from Mapei’s perspective was that Arodo reach an agreement\nwith SK that “keeps [SK] away from Mapei” because Mapei had “no desire to\ninteract with [SK].” After a July meeting between Mapei and Arodo, a business\nadvisor working on behalf of Arodo (who attended the July meeting) informed\nSK that Mapei did not wish to work with SK anymore and that Arodo would\ndeal directly with Mapei. The business advisor also informed SK that if the\nparties could not finalize the paperwork for a series of related agreements by\nSeptember 1 that contained (among other things) a commitment that SK not\nsue Mapei in exchange for a commission on the Arovacs that Arodo sold to\nMapei, his “suggestion [wa]s that Arodo and SK will go their ‘own way.’”\n      SK refused to commit to such an agreement, but Arodo and SK did not\nimmediately go their own way. The parties continued to work together under\nthe Distributorship Agreement until Arodo was served with the present suit in\nMarch 2010, at which time Arodo informed SK that “cooperation between SK\nand Arodo is finished.” However, after SK’s refusal to reach an agreement with\nArodo on Mapei, Arodo and Mapei dealt directly with each other. In late 2008,\nArodo sold the three remaining phase-one Arovacs to Mapei, and in February\n2009, Arodo entered into a formal exclusivity agreement with Mapei (which\ncovered product segments beyond cement-based tile adhesives). Later that\nyear, Arodo formally recalled “any exclusivity” SK had been granted to sell\n                                     10\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nArovacs in North America. Arodo ultimately sold six additional Arovacs (nine\ntotal) directly to Mapei. SK did not receive any compensation from Arodo’s\ndirect sales to Mapei, other than Arodo returning to SK the down payment it\nplaced for the three phase-one Arovacs.\nB. Procedural History\n       SK filed suit against Arodo and Mapei in Texas state court on January\n21, 2010, asserting, inter alia, claims for breach of contract and tortious\ninterference with an existing contract against both. 5 With respect to Mapei,\nSK alleged that it breached an agreement to purchase 14 Arovacs (reflected in\nthe Price Quotation and Order Confirmation) and that it tortiously interfered\nwith two related agreements SK had with Arodo: (1) the Distributorship\nAgreement and (2) an agreement established by the SK-Arodo Purchase\nOrders guaranteeing SK exclusivity in Mapei’s industry (i.e., cement-based tile\nadhesives). SK’s claims against Arodo largely mirrored its claims against\nMapei. SK alleged a tortious interference claim against Arodo for its alleged\ninterference with SK’s contract with Mapei to purchase 14 Arovacs, as well as\na claim for breach of two related agreements: (1) the Distributorship\nAgreement and (2) an agreement established by the SK-Arodo Purchase\nOrders guaranteeing SK exclusivity in Mapei’s industry (i.e., cement-based tile\nadhesives).\n       Mapei removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity\njurisdiction, where Arodo moved to compel arbitration of SK’s claims against\nit based on the broad arbitration agreement in the SK-Arodo Purchase Orders.\nThe district court granted Arodo’s motion and stayed further proceedings\n\n\n\n       5 Among SK’s other claims was one for fraud against Mapei. The district court granted\nMapei’s Rule 50(a) motion on that claim, and on appeal, SK “conditionally seeks a new trial”\non that claim in the event this court affirms the district court’s grant of a new trial. Because\nwe reverse the district court’s grant of a new trial, we do not address SK’s fraud claim.\n                                              11\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\npending the resolution of SK’s claims against Arodo in arbitration.                  The\narbitration occurred before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris\non June 21, 2013. In the final award, the arbitrator found, inter alia, that\nArodo did not breach the Distributorship Agreement by directly selling Arovacs\nto Mapei or commit an “abuse of right” by terminating that agreement in\nMarch 2010 precisely because the Distributorship Agreement was non-\nexclusive and of an indefinite duration. But the arbitrator did find that Arodo\n“severely breached” the exclusivity it granted to SK as distributor for Mapei’s\nindustry in the SK-Arodo Purchase Orders and did tortiously interfere with a\n“valid contract” between SK and Mapei to purchase 14 Arovacs by contracting\ndirectly with Mapei for subsequent Arovacs. The arbitrator also found SK was\nentitled to damages for both the breach and the tortious interference and\nawarded SK €491,634 in damages on its breach of contract claim, representing\nthe lost profits on machines 2 through 4 (€533,535) less the deposit Arodo\nreturned to SK on those machines (€41,901). 6 The arbitrator declined to award\ndamages on machines 5 through 14 or for related service charges because SK\nhad not proved “known added value” for them, as required to “receive\ncompensation under Article 3 of the Belgian Law of 27 July 1961.”\n      SK then moved in the district court to reopen the proceedings against\nMapei and Arodo. After re-opening the case, the district court dismissed SK’s\nremaining claims against Arodo under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). 7\nThe district court thereafter denied SK and Mapei’s competing motions for\nsummary judgment on SK’s claims against Mapei for breach of contract and\ntortious interference with an existing contract claim, and those claims\n\n\n      6   The arbitrator did not separately award damages on SK’s tortious interference\nclaims (despite finding SK was entitled to damages) because these damages were included in\nthe breach of contract award. The arbitrator did, however, separately award SK two thirds\nof the cost of arbitration and legal fees.\n        7 SK did not appeal this dismissal, and it is not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                           12\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nproceeded to a jury trial. At the close of SK’s case in chief, Mapei moved for\njudgment as a matter of law (JMOL) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 50(a) on both of those claims, which the district court denied.\nFollowing the week-long trial, the jury found that Mapei breached a contract\nwith SK to purchase more than one Arovac and that Mapei tortiously\ninterfered with SK’s contractual relationship with Arodo. The jury awarded\nroughly $1.5 million to SK for breach of contract and roughly $6.1 million to\nSK for tortious interference (including over $2.7 million in punitive damages).\n      The district court requested post-verdict briefing, asking the parties to\naddress whether there was “evidence indicating the owner of Mapei[ 8] gave his\nauthorization to purchase more than one Arovac machine from [SK,] . . . along\nwith everything else that you want to address.” Mapei subsequently filed a\nrenewed motion for JMOL under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) on both\nSK’s breach of contract and tortious interference with an existing contract\nclaims, raising a number of different reasons why JMOL was appropriate,\nincluding an absence of evidence of authority by anyone to bind Mapei to\ncontract to purchase more than one Arovac. Alternatively, Mapei moved for a\nnew trial pursuant to Rule 59. In response, SK argued, inter alia, that Mapei\nwaived the issue of lack of authority by not raising the issue in its Rule 50(a)\nmotion and that the jury’s findings, in any event, had sufficient legal and\nfactual support. After requesting and receiving additional briefing on whether\nSK was required to specifically plead apparent authority, the court granted\nMapei’s renewed JMOL motion, setting aside the jury verdict for those\n“reasons set forth in Mapei’s [renewed JMOL motion], together with Mapei’s\npost-verdict briefs.”      The district court also conditionally granted Mapei’s\nrequest for a new trial “for the reason that the verdict of the jury on [SK’s\n\n\n      8   The reference was apparently to Dr. Squinzi.\n                                             13\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\nbreach of contract and tortious interference claims] is against the great weight\nand preponderance of the evidence.”\n                 II. JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW\n      The district court granted JMOL on both SK’s breach of contract and\ntortious interference with an existing contract claims. Because the reasons\nasserted in Mapei’s renewed JMOL motion differed as to each claim, we\naddress each one separately. But, first, we address the appropriate standard\nof review.\nA. Standard of Review\n      When a case is tried to a jury, a renewed motion for JMOL under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 50(b) “is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting the jury’s verdict.” Cowart v. Erwin, 837 F.3d 444, 450\n(5th Cir. 2016) (quoting Heck v. Triche, 775 F.3d 265, 272 (5th Cir. 2014)). In\nreviewing a challenge to a jury verdict, “we draw all reasonable inferences and\nresolve all credibility determinations in the light most favorable to the\n[verdict].” Id. (quoting Heck, 775 F.3d at 273). The motion should be denied\n“unless there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to\nfind as the jury did.” Id. (quoting Heck, 775 F.3d at 273). We review the district\ncourt’s ruling on a renewed motion for JMOL under Rule 50(b) de novo,\napplying the same standard in reviewing the motion as the district court. Id.\nDespite the de novo standard, our review is “especially deferential” to the jury’s\nverdict. Brown v. Bryan County, 219 F.3d 450, 456 (5th Cir. 2000) (citing\nSnyder v. Trepagnier, 142 F.3d 791, 795 (5th Cir. 1998)).\n      “However, ‘[c]hallenges to the sufficiency of the evidence must be raised\nin a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of\nlaw before submission of the case to the jury.” Seibert v. Jackson County¸ 851\nF.3d 430, 435 (5th Cir. 2017) (alteration in original) (quoting Stover v.\nHattiesburg Pub. Sch. Dist., 549 F.3d 985, 995 (5th Cir. 2008)). When an issue\n                                       14\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nis not raised in a Rule 50(a) motion, our review of the jury’s verdict is only for\nplain error because a party cannot “renew” a motion on an issue it never\nraised. 9 See Flowers v. S. Reg’l Physician Servs. Inc., 247 F.3d 229, 238 (5th\nCir. 2001).      Factual sufficiency plain error review requires us to decide\n“whether there was any evidence to support the jury verdict.” Id. (quoting\nUnited States ex rel. Wallace v. Flintco Inc., 143 F.3d 955, 964 (5th Cir. 1998)).\n“If any evidence exists that supports the verdict, it will be upheld.” Id.\nB. Breach of Contract\n       On appeal, SK attacks each of the bases asserted in Mapei’s renewed\nmotion for JMOL on its breach of contract claim: (1) there was no meeting of\nthe minds as to the purchase of more than one Arovac; (2) the exclusivity\nprovision must be construed as a matter of law in Mapei’s favor; and (3) no one\nwith authority ever bound Mapei to purchase more than one Arovac. It also\nattacks the alternative basis for affirming raised by Mapei: SK’s breach of\ncontract claim is barred by Texas’s one-satisfaction rule. We address each\nbasis in turn.\n       1. Meeting of the Minds\n       Under Texas’s codification of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), “[a]\ncontract for [the] sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show\nagreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence\nof such a contract.” 10 Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 2.204. The parties agree\nthat they formed a contract for sale, but dispute whether that contract was for\none Arovac or for 14 Arovacs. The dispute largely hinges on what the “offer”\nand “acceptance” were for purposes of contract formation. According to SK, the\n\n\n       9  An exception to this rule applies when a non-movant fails, in the district court, to\nobject to the new issue being raised in the Rule 50(b) motion; in that instance, the non-movant\ndoes not benefit from limited plain error review. See Montano v. Orange County, 842 F.3d\n865, 877 (5th Cir. 2016).\n        10 Texas law applies in this diversity action.\n\n                                              15\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\nPrice Quotation (which contained the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision) was the\noffer, which Mapei accepted via the Mapei-SK Purchase Order.                         Mapei\ncounters that the Price Quotation was not an offer because it contained what\nMapei terms a “home office acceptance” clause, reserving the right of SK’s\nheadquarters to approve the Price Quotation. In Mapei’s view, the Mapei-SK\nPurchase Order was the offer, which SK accepted with the Order\nConfirmation. 11\n       a. The Offer\n       “An offer is an act that leads the offeree reasonably to believe that assent\n(i.e., acceptance) will conclude the deal.” Axelson, Inc. v. McEvoy–Willis, 7 F.3d\n1230, 1232–33 (5th Cir. 1993). “Generally, a price quotation, such as one\nappearing in a brochure or on a flyer, is not considered an offer; rather, it is\ntypically viewed as an invitation to offer.” J.D. Fields & Co. v. U.S. Steel Int’l,\nInc., 426 F. App’x 271, 276 (5th Cir. 2011). Despite this general rule, a price\nquotation can constitute an offer if, under the totality of the circumstances, it\nleads the recipient reasonably to believe that assent to the quotation is all that\nis needed to ripen the quotation into a contract. Id. at 276–77; see also, e.g.,\nDyno Const. Co. v. McWane, Inc., 198 F.3d 567, 572 (6th Cir. 1999). Although\nthat inquiry necessarily depends on the facts of the particular case, it often\nturns on the quotation’s level of detail, the extent of prior inquiry, and the\nnumber of persons to whom the quotation was sent. J.D. Fields, 426 F. App’x\nat 280; see also, e.g., Nordyne v. Int’l Controls & Measurements Corp., 262 F.3d\n843, 846 (8th Cir. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n       11Thus, according to Mapei, the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision in SK’s Order\nConfirmation (to the extent it obligated Mapei to buy 13 additional Arovacs) differed\nmaterially from its Purchase Order and did not become part of the parties’ contract. See Tex.\nBus. & Com. Code Ann. § 2.207(b)(2).\n                                             16\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\n       In this case, each of these factors weighs in favor of the jury’s implied\nfinding that the Price Quotation was an offer. First, the Price Quotation was\nhighly detailed, totaling more than 50 pages and containing all the necessary\nelements for a contract.        Second, the Price Quotation was not the initial\nsubstantive contact between the parties. Rather, as detailed supra, the Price\nQuotation followed numerous meetings and communications between the\nparties over the nearly ten-month period between August 2006 and June 2007,\nwhich resulted in two separate sets of revisions. Finally, the Price Quotation\nwas not a generalized quote sent to a number of potential customers, “such as\none appearing in a brochure or on a flyer.” J.D. Fields, 426 F. App’x at 276. It\nwas prepared and revised twice specifically for Mapei, at Mapei’s request.\n       The home office acceptance clause in the Price Quotation’s lengthy terms\nand conditions section—stating that “[a]ll quotations, orders and agreements\nmade between [Mapei] and [SK]’s [agent] shall be subject to the acceptance and\napproval of [SK]’s headquarters”—certainly does undermine the jury’s implied\nfinding that the quotation was an offer. 12 See id. at 279 (recognizing a home\noffice approval clause will prevent the formation of a contract when it is\nintended as a condition precedent to contract formation); see also, e.g.,\nNordyne, 262 F.3d at 847. But we cannot say, as Mapei urges, that it prevented\nthe Price Quotation from constituting an offer as a matter of law. See Crest\nRidge Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Newcourt Inc., 78 F.3d 146, 150 (5th Cir. 1996)\n(concluding that a clause in a price quotation stating it was subject to credit\ndepartment approval did not prevent it from being an offer as a matter of law).\n“[I]n light of the extensive dealings and preparations between these two\nparties, the jury could conclude this [home office approval] clause at most\n\n\n\n        SK’s co-owner explained at trial that the provision was drafted by SK’s attorney and\n       12\n\nmistakenly excludes the word “agent” after the first reference to SK.\n                                            17\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\ncreated a condition precedent on [SK]’s obligation to perform and did not\nprevent the formation of a contract.” Id. Indeed, the evidence showed that the\nPrice Quotation was already approved by SK’s “corporate headquarters”; it was\nprepared by SK’s co-owner at, and sent directly from, SK’s Texas headquarters.\nSee Nordyne, 262 F.3d at 846.\n      While the parties’ explanations of “industry custom . . . in this case are\nrelevant to the issue of reasonableness, the UCC never informs that industry\ncustom and course of dealing are alone determinative of the issue of contract\nformation.” J.D. Fields, 426 F. App’x at 280 (emphasis omitted). As such, we\ndo not believe SK’s testimony on industry practice—namely, that a purchase\norder must “kiss” an order confirmation to form a contract—means that the\nPrice Quotation was not an offer as a matter of law. See id. Indeed, Mapei’s\nown CapEx process, which requires all “contract specifics” to be submitted for\napproval, suggests that it viewed the Price Quotation as an offer. Viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, there was legally\nsufficient evidence for the jury to impliedly conclude that the Price Quotation\nwas an offer.\n      b. The Acceptance\n      Under     the   UCC,    “[a]     definite   and   seasonable   expression   of\nacceptance . . . operates    as   an     acceptance     even   though    it   states\nterms . . . different from those offered.” Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 2.207(a).\nThus, unlike the “mirror image” rule at common law, the mere fact that a\nmerchant’s acceptance form contains materially different terms than the offer\ndoes not mean that it will be considered a rejection or counter-offer. See, e.g.,\nJOM, Inc. v. Adell Plastics, Inc., 193 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 1999) (en banc) (per\ncuriam). Rather, the form generally must provide unambiguous notice that it\nis a rejection or counter-offer. See, e.g., Gage Prods. Co. v. Henkel Corp., 393\nF.3d 629, 642 (6th Cir. 2004).\n                                           18\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\n           Here, the Purchase Order unquestionably contained different terms\nfrom the Price Quotation: it omitted many of the provisions included in the\nPrice Quotation, including the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision, and identified\nquantities of “2” instead of “1” for several optional items to be included with\nthe Arovac. 13 Under one view of the facts, these differences, particularly the\nomission of the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision, suggest that Mapei’s decision\nto send the Purchase Order for only one Arovac was an unambiguous rejection\nof the Price Quotation’s offer. This view is bolstered by SK’s May 7, 2007 email\nto Mapei indicating that Mapei’s purchase order must include a “guarantee for\nsubsequent machine[s]” for Mapei to obtain exclusivity.            It finds further\nsupport in the fact that, if Mapei accepted the Price Quotation’s 13-Arovac\nexclusivity provision (and SK’s construction that it obligated Mapei to buy 13\nArovacs), Mapei would be required to make a substantial capital investment of\nnearly $14 million in Arovacs without any commitment from the big-box\nretailer, which it understandably would be hesitant to do.\n       Yet, an alternative view of the facts suggests that Mapei’s Purchase\nOrder did manifest acceptance of the Price Quotation, even though the terms\nof the two materially differed. As an initial matter, a purchase order for more\nthan one Arovac was neither “expect[ed]” nor would “make any sense” under\nthe circumstances because the Price Quotation’s exclusivity provision was\ncontingent on the first Arovac working. Moreover, SK’s May 7, 2007 email to\nMapei preceded Mapei’s May 14, 2007 email indicating that, if SK wanted to\nspecify the number of machines in the Price Quotation (that it submitted the\nfollowing day), “th[e]n [SK] can put down 2/quarter, assuming again that the\nequipment will perform as planned.” Finally, despite the substantial capital\n\n\n\n       13   Specifically, “Quick Removable Augers,” a “Handle Former,” and an “I-mark\nreader.”\n                                          19\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\ninvestment required by SK’s construction of the 13-Arovac exclusivity\nprovision, a reasonable jury could have concluded that such an investment was\nnecessary on Mapei’s part to prevent its competitors from obtaining the Arovac\nand, thereby, potentially securing a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we cannot\nconclude there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury’s implied\nacceptance of this latter view.\n       2. Contract Construction\n       Mapei argued in its renewed motion for JMOL that, even if the Price\nQuotation was an offer and its Purchase Order the acceptance, the Price\nQuotation’s exclusivity provision did not, in fact, require Mapei to purchase 13\nadditional Arovacs.       Rather, it simply provided that, in order to obtain\nexclusivity, Mapei had to buy 13 additional Arovacs. 14 Accordingly, Mapei\nasked the district court to construe the provision as a matter of law in its favor.\n       The Price Quotation’s exclusivity provision states in plain terms that,\n“[i]f the first machine operates as specified in this order, Mapei agrees and is\ncommitted to purchase [13] subsequent machines” and “SK will grant Mapei\nexclusivity to the Arovac . . . for its industry.” The fact that this statement\nappears under the heading of “Exclusivity” does not compel construction in\nMapei’s favor, as it urges. The heading merely reflects that the promise by\nMapei to purchase 13 Arovacs and the promise by SK to grant exclusivity are\nreciprocal.    It does not, however, indicate whether they are independent\n\n\n\n\n       14 It is not entirely clear whether, under Mapei’s proposed construction, exclusivity\nwould (1) first attach when all 14 Arovacs were purchased or (2) end when Mapei stopped\npurchasing Arovacs according to the contemplated schedule. Because the first construction\nwould not make commercial sense—it would require Mapei to forfeit any potential edge and\nrisk serious exposure by having to wait two years before obtaining exclusivity—we presume\nit intended the latter construction, despite contrary testimony from at least one of its\nemployees.\n                                            20\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\npromises (i.e., Mapei must buy 13 Arovacs and SK must grant exclusivity,\nregardless of whether the other performs) or are dependent promises (i.e., SK\nmust grant exclusivity so long as Mapei continues to buy 13 Arovacs over the\nspecified two-year period). The fact that the only conditional language in the\n13-Arovac exclusivity provision relates to the first Arovac operating as\nspecified suggests that the former construction is the correct one. Indeed, in\nits motion for summary judgment and in its Rule 50(a) motion, Mapei\neffectively conceded as much, arguing that the virtually identical exclusivity\nclause in SK’s Order Confirmation transformed Mapei’s purchase order for one\nmachine into a commitment to purchase 14 machines and, thus, increased the\nprice of Mapei’s order by approximately $13 million. Accordingly, Mapei’s\nrequest to now construe the Price Quotation’s 13-Arovac exclusivity provision\nin its favor must be rejected. See, e.g., In re Isbell Records, Inc., 774 F.3d 859,\n868–69 (5th Cir. 2014) (refusing to set aside jury verdict based on argument\nraised in Rule 50(b) motion that was previously disclaimed in connection with\nRule 50(a) motion).\n      3. Authority\n      After the jury returned its verdict, the district court requested post-\nverdict briefing on whether evidence proved Dr. Squinzi, the chief executive\nofficer, chairman, and majority shareholder of Mapei’s parent company,\nauthorized the purchase of more than one Arovac. In response, Mapei filed a\nrenewed motion for JMOL, raising this lack-of-authority argument for the first\ntime. Mapei did argue in its initial motion for JMOL (and its motion for\nsummary judgment, which it purported to incorporate by reference) that there\nwas not a “meeting of the minds” as to more than one Arovac, but critically\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\nnever raised the distinct issue of authority. 15 See, e.g., Anland N., L.P. v. Ctr.\nOperating Co., No. 05–12–00128–CV, 2012 WL 2045371, at *3 (Tex. App.—\nDallas June 7, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op., not designated for publication)\n(analyzing issue of authority separate from existence of a meeting of minds).\nIn fact, the word “authority” only appears once in either Mapei’s initial motion\nfor JMOL or motion for summary judgment—in a footnote.                        Because SK\nobjected to the lack-of-authority issue not being raised in Mapei’s Rule 50(a)\nmotion, our review is under the plain error standard discussed supra, which\nrequires us to affirm the jury’s implied finding of authority if there is any\nevidence that supports it.\n       In Texas, the authority to manage the affairs of a corporation, like\nMapei, is vested in its board of directors, and the authority of its officers and\nagents to contract on its behalf “must be found either in specific statutes, in\nthe organic law of the corporation, or in a delegation of authority from the\nboard of directors.” Agri Exp. Coop. v. Universal Sav. Ass’n, 767 F. Supp. 824,\n829 (S.D. Tex. 1991), corrected, 780 F. Supp. 1466 (S.D. Tex. 1991) (citing\nTempleton v. Nocona Hills Owners Ass’n, 555 S.W.2d 534, 537 (Tex. Civ. App.—\nTexarkana 1977, no writ)). Yet even when an officer or agent’s actual authority\nis lacking, “apparent authority may arise by a princip[al]’s action which lacks\nsuch ordinary care as to clothe an agent with the indicia of authority, thus\nleading a reasonably prudent person to believe that the agent has the authority\nhe purports to exercise.” Id. at 830; see also NationsBank, N.A. v. Dilling, 922\nS.W.2d 950, 952–53 (Tex. 1996) (per curiam). Thus, “[a]pparent authority is\nnot available where the other contracting party has notice of the limitations of\n\n\n       15 An absence of authority and an absence of a meeting of the minds are related but\ndistinct elements of contract formation. Thus, a lack of a meeting of a minds is fatal to the\nformation of any contract, even a contract into which an employee might have had authority\nto enter. Conversely, a meeting of the minds does not form a contract when the employee is\nnot authorized to enter into the agreement.\n                                             22\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\nthe agent’s power.” Humble Nat’l Bank v. DCV, Inc., 933 S.W.2d 224, 238 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, writ denied).\n      Here, the evidence clearly demonstrates several things: (1) the Mapei\nemployees with whom SK communicated were delegated authority by Mapei’s\nboard to conduct preliminary negotiations on large purchases in preparation\nfor submission through Mapei’s internal CapEx process; (2) the delegation of\nauthority to those employees was limited to preliminary negotiations—they\ncould not commit Mapei to make capital expenditures of more than €10,000\nwithout obtaining approval from its board and Dr. Squinzi; (3) Mapei and SK’s\nemployees knew about that limitation on those employees’ authority; and (4)\nMapei’s board and Dr. Squinzi approved the CapEx submitted in connection\nwith the Price Quotation. Thus, the principal question we must answer is\nwhether there is any evidence to demonstrate the CapEx submitted was for\nthe purchase of 14 Arovacs, rather than one Arovac.\n      The evidence presented at trial on the issue was thin. The record does\nnot contain the form by which the CapEx was approved; the contents of that\nform or the materials attached to it, other than the Price Quotation; or\ntestimony or minutes reflecting exactly what Mapei’s board or Dr. Squinzi\nunderstood was being submitted for approval. Emails and testimony from\nMapei’s employees indicating that Mapei’s board would not approve\nsubsequent purchase orders without a contract from the big-box retailer are\ncertainly probative that the board and Dr. Squinzi only approved the purchase\nof one Arovac. (The CapEx was approved before Mapei obtained the new\ncontract with the big-box retailer.) So is the fact that Mapei issued a purchase\norder for only one Arovac, especially in the face of SK’s request that Mapei’s\n“guarantee for subsequent machine[s]” be included in the purchase order.\n      Yet, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict\nas we must, we cannot say that there is no evidence that Mapei’s board and\n                                       23\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nDr. Squinzi approved the purchase of 14 Arovacs. An exclusive arrangement\nwith SK was admittedly critical to Mapei’s efforts to win back its lost contract\nand it was reasonably understood that, in order to obtain such an arrangement,\nMapei would ultimately be required to buy more than one Arovac from SK.\nMoreover, the conduct of the employees principally tasked with submitting the\nCapEx is consistent with Mapei committing to purchase more than one Arovac\n(e.g., discussing delivery dates, discounts, and product designs for subsequent\nmachines with SK before any purchase order was approved for those\nmachines). Finally, the fact that the Mapei-SK Purchase Order related to only\na single Arovac was not necessarily inconsistent with the purchase of 14\nArovacs because the purchase of the remaining 13 was contingent on the first\none working.       Given the plain error standard of review, which considers\nwhether there is any evidence to support the jury’s implied finding of authority,\nthe jury’s verdict must be respected.\n       4. Texas’s One–Satisfaction Rule\n       As an alternative basis for affirming, Mapei asserts that SK is barred\nfrom recovering on its breach of contract claim against Mapei because SK has\nalready recovered from Arodo for claims that Arodo interfered with the same\nalleged contract. 16 According to Mapei, at arbitration, the arbitrator found\nthat Arodo tortiously interfered with SK’s contract with Mapei and, consistent\nwith Texas law, awarded SK damages equal to the benefit of its alleged bargain\nwith Mapei—its lost profits. Because SK already recovered its lost profits from\nArodo on this contract, Mapei asserts the one-satisfaction rule precludes SK\nfrom recovering more lost profits from it.\n\n\n       16 In its renewed motion for JMOL, Mapei raised the one-satisfaction rule, but only as\nto SK’s tortious interference claim. Mapei did, however, previously raise the one-satisfaction\nrule as to SK’s breach of contract in its motion for summary (which it purported to incorporate\ninto its Rule 50(a) motion). Because Mapei’s argument is meritless, we need not parse\nwhether de novo or plain error review is more appropriate under this circumstance.\n                                             24\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n      In the arbitration, SK did recover damages from Arodo, but these\ndamages only related to Mapei’s purchase of machines 2 through 4 on account\nof intricacies in Belgian damages law that Mapei does not expound upon in its\nbriefing. In this case, governed by Texas law, the jury apparently heeded\nMapei’s repeated assertions that SK had already been compensated for\nmachines 2 through 4 and awarded damages for only machines 5 through 14;\nits award was for an amount less than requested by SK and in line with the\nprofits SK could have reasonably stood to gain from only machines 5 through\n14. Thus, there is no double-recovery in this case or, consequently, any role for\nthe one-satisfaction rule. See, e.g., Coastal Agric. Supply, Inc. v. JP Morgan\nChase Bank, N.A., 759 F.3d 498, 511–12 & n.82 (5th Cir. 2014) (recognizing\nthe one-satisfaction rule provides an offset to damages to prevent a double\nrecovery); Mobil Chem. Co. v. Blount Bros. Corp., 809 F.2d 1175, 1180 n.4 (5th\nCir. 1987) (same); see also, e.g., Oyster Creek Fin. Corp. v. Richwood Invs. II,\nInc., 176 S.W.3d 307, 328 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, pet. denied).\n      5. Conclusion\n      The jury was presented with two alternative, but plausible, accounts of\nthe formation and authorization of a contract. The jury reasonably selected\none of those alternatives. Therefore, we discern no basis for setting aside the\njury’s verdict on SK’s breach of contract claim.\nC. Tortious Interference\n      As discussed supra, SK alleged that its contractual relationship with\nArodo had two components: (1) an exclusive distributorship for SK to sell to\nMapei pursuant to the SK-Arodo Purchase Orders and (2) a non-exclusive\ndistributorship for SK to sell to North American customers pursuant to the\nDistributorship Agreement. In its renewed motion for JMOL, Mapei asserted\nthat SK had provided legally insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Mapei’s\nalleged interference caused SK any damages. Specifically, Mapei argued that\n                                       25\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nSK had failed to provide anything beyond unsupported speculation that it\nwould have sold more than the 14 Arovacs which it contracted with Mapei to\nresell through its contractual relationship with Arodo.                 Therefore, Mapei\nargued, SK was limited to its breach of contract recovery (i.e., the profits it\nwould have earned from buying the 14 Arovacs from Arodo and reselling them\nto Mapei at a marked-up price). On this point, we agree with Mapei. 17\n       SK was not guaranteed any profit from its contractual relationship with\nArodo. Under that relationship, SK was merely entitled to buy Arovacs from\nArodo and resell them at a marked-up price to third-parties, like Mapei. Thus,\nthe only potential damages SK suffered from Mapei’s interference with its\ncontractual relationship with Arodo were lost profits it would have derived\nfrom sales to third-parties. SK produced two experts at trial to quantify the\nvalue of the lost profits it suffered. The first expert, an accountant, testified to\nthe profits SK would have earned from its sale of the 14 Arovacs to Mapei (i.e.,\nthe damage SK suffered from Mapei’s breach of contract). The second expert,\nan economist, testified to lost profits SK would have earned from sales to other\ncompanies (i.e., the damage SK suffered from Mapei’s alleged tortious\ninterference). Mapei challenges this second expert’s testimony—the principal,\nif not sole, basis for the jury’s lost profits award on SK’s tortious interference\nclaim—as nothing more than unsupported speculation.\n       For a plaintiff to recover lost profits, there must a causal relationship\nbetween the amount of lost profits suffered by the plaintiff and the defendant’s\nactions. See Homoki v. Conversion Servs., Inc., 717 F.3d 388, 398 (5th Cir.\n\n\n\n       17 Therefore, we do not address the remaining bases asserted by Mapei for granting\nJMOL on SK’s tortious interference claim: (1) collateral estoppel precludes SK from re-\nlitigating its damages arising from its relationship with Arodo, which were fully litigated in\nthe SK-Arodo arbitration; (2) Texas’s one-satisfaction rule precludes recovery beyond that\nawarded in the SK-Arodo arbitration; and (3) the Distributorship Agreement with Arodo is\nnot an enforceable contract under Texas law.\n                                             26\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n2013). Although the amount of lost profits need not be susceptible to exact\ncalculation, the plaintiff “must do more than show that they suffered some lost\nprofits.” Holt Atherton Indus., Inc. v. Heine, 835 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Tex. 1992); see\nalso Szcepanik v. First S. Trust Co., 883 S.W.2d 648, 650 (Tex. 1994). The\nplaintiff must prove the amount of lost profits “by competent evidence with\nreasonable certainty.” Szcepanik, 883 S.W.2d at 649; see also Phillips v.\nCarlton Energy Grp., LLC, 475 S.W.3d 265, 278–79 (Tex. 2015).              As a\nminimum, this requires the amount of lost profits to be based on objective facts,\nfigures, or data and be predicated on one complete calculation. Holt Atherton\nIndus., 835 S.W.2d at 84–85; see also Phillips, 475 S.W.3d at 278–79. When a\nplaintiff’s lost profits are dependent on its lost contracts with customers, both\nthe existence and the number of such contracts must be proved with reasonable\ncertainty. Great Pines Water Co. v. Liqui-Box Corp., 203 F.3d 920, 922–23 (5th\nCir. 2000). “[T]he bare assertion that contracts were lost does not demonstrate\na reasonably certain objective determination of lost profits.” Holt Atherton\nIndus., 835 S.W.2d at 85.\n      Here, SK’s economic expert estimated SK’s lost profits from future sales\nby, first, taking the (largely unchallenged) incremental profit from an Arovac\nsale calculated by SK’s accounting expert, second, multiplying that\nincremental profit by the number of Arovacs that he estimated SK would have\nsold per year but for Mapei’s alleged interference, and, finally, applying a\ndiscount rate to the resulting annual incremental profit to account for market\nrisks that might preclude that amount of profit from being realized. With\nrespect to the second step, SK’s economic expert estimated that SK would sell\nseven machines per year. That estimate, however, was based on nothing more\nthan speculation.   It was not supported by any empirical analysis or any\nevidence outside of the tripartite relationship between SK, Arodo, and Mapei\n(e.g., real-world sales, customer surveys, or current market demand).\n                                       27\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n      As justification for his estimate, SK’s economic expert cited SK’s contract\nwith Mapei to purchase 14 machines over two years and emails between Mapei\nand Arodo dickering over exclusivity, in which Mapei indicates Arodo could\n“sell dozens of [Arovacs] in [certain product segments] with adequate\nrepresentation and technical support.” But neither piece of evidence takes the\nexpert’s estimate of seven machines per year out of the realm of mere\nspeculation.   Beyond the obvious fact that the existence of the SK-Mapei\ncontract was bitterly contested, the contract was clearly the result of Mapei’s\nunique demand in 2006 and 2007, which was created by Mapei’s efforts to\nobtain a new contract with the big-box retailer. Thus, the SK-Mapei contract\ndoes not provide any evidence that SK would have obtained similar contracts\nin the future (let alone that SK did not obtain those contracts on account of\nMapei’s alleged interference). See McBeth v. Carpenter, 565 F.3d 171, 176–77\n(5th Cir. 2009) (concluding evidence that a “later transaction” was profitable\nwas not evidence of lost profits due to defendants’ actions because the later\ntransaction was “markedly different” from the transaction at issue). This\nconclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Distributorship Agreement was\nterminable at will. See Blase Indus. Corp. v. Anorad Corp., 442 F.3d 235, 238\n(5th Cir. 2006) (concluding future lost profit estimate from at-will arrangement\nwas too speculative to support damages); see also Mood v. Kronos Prods. Inc.,\n245 S.W.3d 8, 13 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007, pet. denied) (concluding expert’s\ndamages model was no evidence of lost profits because it assumed the\ncontinuance of a distributorship agreement). Similarly, Mapei and Arodo’s\nunsubstantiated, self-serving speculations about future sales are “legally\ninsufficient to show lost profits.” Szcepanik, 883 S.W.2d at 650; see also\nSportsBrand Network Recovery Fund, Inc. v. PGA Tour, Inc., 136 F.3d 1329,\n1998 WL 44564, at *11–12 (5th Cir. 1998) (unpublished) (concluding parties’\nprojections were too speculative to serve as a basis for lost profits claim).\n                                       28\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nAccordingly, the economic expert’s testimony did not furnish a legally\nsufficient evidentiary basis for the jury to award lost profits beyond those SK\nwould have earned under its contract with Mapei. 18 See Genmoora Corp. v.\nMoore Bus. Forms, Inc., 939 F.2d 1149, 1157 (5th Cir. 1991), on reh’g (Sept. 30,\n1991); see also Great Pines Water Co., 203 F.3d at 923–24.\n       SK nonetheless asserts that the jury’s award of lost profits beyond those\nit would have earned under its contract with Mapei should stand because the\nevidence at trial showed a company inquired in 2009 about a potential\npurchase of Arovacs. Although this inquiry may be some evidence of demand\nfor the Arovac, it is no evidence of lost profits SK suffered from Mapei’s breach\nor alleged interference. According to the testimony of one of SK’s co-owners,\nthe inquiring company was a direct competitor of Mapei’s and, therefore,\ncovered under the exclusivity provision in SK’s contract with Mapei. Thus, the\n2009 inquiry could not have yielded a contract even in the absence of Mapei’s\nbreach or alleged interference. 19 The 2009 inquiry then cannot constitute\nreasonably certain evidence of SK’s lost profits in this case.\n       With legally insufficient evidence to support an award of damages\nbeyond those that SK suffered as a result of Mapei’s breach of contract, we\naffirm the district court’s decision to grant JMOL on SK’s claim for tortious\ninterference with an existing contract and its related claim for punitive\n\n\n\n\n       18 Indeed, the objective sales data we could locate in the record suggests that Arodo\nhas only sold 12 fully operational Arovacs ever. The two Arovacs that were not sold to Mapei\nwere also apparently sold by SK, so there is no lost profits attributable to them. Both of those\npurchasers, however, appear to have had a dispute with SK and no longer buy from SK.\n       19 Although SK’s other co-owner seemed to testify that SK could have sold to the\n\ncompany after 2009—when he asserted exclusivity ended—there is nothing in the plain\nlanguage of the exclusivity clause that supports termination of the exclusivity granted to\nMapei at the end of 2009. SK, just like Mapei, is bound by the construction of the exclusivity\nprovision outlined supra.\n                                              29\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\ndamages. 20 See Bellefonte Underwriters Ins. v. Brown, 704 S.W.2d 742, 745\n(Tex. 1986) (holding that punitive damages are unavailable in the absence of a\nshowing of actual tort damages).\n                 III. CONDITIONAL GRANT OF NEW TRIAL\n       In light of our conclusion that the district court erred in granting JMOL\non SK’s breach of contract claim, we must address the district court’s\nconditional grant of a new trial with respect to that claim. The district court\nconditionally granted a new trial because “the verdict of the jury on [SK’s\nbreach of contract claim] is against the weight and preponderance of the\nevidence.” We review a district court’s decision on a motion for new trial for\nabuse of discretion. Laxton v. Gap Inc., 333 F.3d 572, 586 (5th Cir. 2003).\nHowever, we accord less deference to a decision to grant a new trial than one\nto deny a new trial, id., exercising “particularly close scrutiny” of a district\ncourt’s grant of a new trial on evidentiary grounds in order “to protect the\nlitigants’ right to a jury trial,” Shows v. Jamison Bedding, Inc., 671 F.2d 927,\n930 (5th Cir. 1982). The standard for granting a new trial is less stringent\nthan the standard for granting JMOL, see Keeler v. Richards Mfg. Co., 817 F.2d\n1197, 1200 (5th Cir. 1987), but a new trial “should not be granted on\nevidentiary grounds ‘unless, at a minimum, the verdict is against the great—\nnot merely the greater—weight of the evidence,’” Shows, 671 F.2d at 930\n(quoting Conway v. Chem. Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 610 F.2d 360, 363 (5th\n\n\n\n       20 Neither in the district nor on appeal has SK asserted that, in the absence of damages\nbeyond those compensated by its contract claim, it would be entitled to elect judgment on its\ntortious interference claim as the most favorable theory of recovery, thereby permitting a\nrecovery of punitive damages. See Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 304\n(Tex. 2006) (discussing election-of-remedies doctrine). Accordingly, SK has waived that issue.\nSee, e.g., Keelan v. Majesco Software, Inc., 407 F.3d 332, 339 (5th Cir. 2005). Regardless,\nbased on our extensive review of the record, we must conclude that SK has failed to provide\nlegally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s award of punitive damages. Accordingly, the\nresult would, in any event, be the same if SK were entitled to make such an election.\n                                              30\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\nCir. 1980) (per curiam)).\n      Here, as detailed supra, the jury was presented with two relatively\nuncomplicated,      but   conflicting,    theories    of   contract    formation     and\nauthorization and resolved the conflicting testimony without any obvious\nprejudicial influences.      Accordingly, despite presenting a very close case\n(particularly with respect to the issue of authority), we conclude that the jury’s\naward on SK’s breach of contract claim was not against the great weight of the\nevidence and that the district court abused its discretion in granting a new\ntrial. See id.\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\n      For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of\nJMOL on SK’s breach of contract claim and its conditional grant of a new trial\nand AFFIRM the district court’s grant of JMOL on SK’s claim for tortious\ninterference with an existing contract and related claim for punitive damages.\nWe REMAND to the district court for entry of judgment consistent herewith\nand for the calculation and award of attorneys’ fees in connection with the\ncontract claim. On its breach of contract claim, SK shall recover pre- and post-\njudgment interest, with pre-judgment interest accruing from the date this suit\nwas filed and with post-judgment interest accruing from the date judgment is\nentered on remand. Pre-judgment interest should be tolled during the period\nthe case was stayed to accommodate the SK-Arodo arbitration. 21 Cf. Johnson\n\n\n\n\n      21  In light of our holding that there has been no double recovery between the\narbitration award and the jury’s award on SK’s breach of contract claim, we reject Mapei’s\nrequest to subtract the amount of the arbitration award in calculating post-judgment\ninterest. We also reject Mapei’s assertion that pre-judgment interest should be denied\nbecause SK’s breach-of-contract damages were not segregated; our review of the record\ndemonstrates that virtually all, if not all, of SK’s breach-of-contract damages were past\ndamages for which it is entitled to pre-judgment interest.\n                                           31\n\f                                No. 16-10430\n& Higgins of Tex., Inc. v.

We REVERSE in\npart, AFFIRM in part, and REMAND for entry of judgment.\n                         I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\nA. Factual Background\n       This case involves a dispute between Stelluti Kerr, L.L.C. (SK) and\nMapei Corporation (Mapei) over the Arovac, a machine used to package the\ncement-based powders that, when mixed with water, become the mortars and\ngrouts used in tile installation.          Historically, these powders have been\npackaged in paper bags, which are prone to leaking and breaking open. The\nArovac, however, packages these powders in plastic bags, which are less prone\nto leak and break. The Arovac is manufactured by Arodo BVBA (Arodo), a\nBelgian company.\n       In early 2006, SK and Arodo entered into an agreement for SK to\ndistribute the Arovac in North America on a non-exclusive basis (the\nDistributorship Agreement).          The Distributorship Agreement was for an\nindefinite duration. At the time, the Arovac was only a prototype, but the\nparties believed the Arovac would soon be perfected and decided to exhibit the\nplastic bags that the prototype was producing at a trade show in May 2006.\nMapei, a Florida-based manufacturer of (among other things) cement-based\ntile adhesives, saw the plastic bags at that show and was immediately\ninterested. 1 Mapei had recently lost a major multi-million dollar contract with\na big-box retailer, which had contracted with a competitor using a cleaner bag\nthan Mapei. To win back that contract, Mapei was actively searching for a\ncleaner package, which Mapei believed the Arovac could ultimately produce.\n\n\n\n       1Although Mapei is based in Florida, it is one of several wholly owned subsidiaries of\nMapei, S.P.A., a privately owned company based in Italy.\n                                             2\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n      SK and Mapei agree that, after their introduction at the 2006 trade\nshow, they formed a contract, but do not agree on much beyond that, including\nwhether the contract was for the sale of one Arovac or 14 Arovacs. Accordingly,\nthe facts underlying the formation of the parties’ contract require a close\nrecounting.\n      1. The Price Quotation Request and the “Gentlemen’s Agreement” on\n         Exclusivity\n      After the 2006 trade show, Mapei invited SK to attend an August\nmeeting at its headquarters with the steering committee tasked with winning\nback its lost contract with the big-box retailer. The attendees agree that Mapei\nrequested SK’s best price quote for one Arovac and that a “gentlemen’s\nagreement” was reached on exclusivity for the Arovac, pursuant to which SK\nwould not sell the Arovac to Mapei’s competitors in North America. The exact\ncontours of the agreement, however, are disputed. According to SK, it could\nnot commit to exclusivity without Arodo’s consent, so the “gentlemen’s\nagreement” was merely that SK would not sell the Arovac to Mapei’s\ncompetitors while the three parties worked out a more definite agreement on\nexclusivity. But according to Mapei, the “gentlemen’s agreement” was that SK\nwould not sell the Arovac to Mapei’s competitors and, in exchange, Mapei\nwould not buy packaging machines from SK’s competitors. Yet Mapei was not\ncommitted to buy, and would not buy, more than an initial pilot Arovac without\na new contract from the big-box retailer.\n      After the meeting, Arodo consented to an exclusive arrangement\nbetween SK and Mapei for distribution of the Arovac.          Arodo’s consent,\nhowever, was conditioned upon Mapei committing to purchase a certain\n(unspecified) number of machines.           Between August and October, SK\nrequested on several different occasions that Mapei disclose the number of\nArovacs that Mapei was committed to purchase to obtain exclusivity.          In\n\n                                       3\n\f                                No. 16-10430\nNovember, SK, still without a number from Mapei, sent Mapei the price\nquotation for one Arovac it requested. The quotation was highly detailed,\ntotaling nearly fifty pages in length. Page 38 of the quotation included a\nprovision captioned “Exclusivity,” which stated that, “[i]f the first machine\noperates as specified in this order, Mapei agrees to a commitment to purchase\na pre-determined quantity of AROVAC machines exclusively from SK . . . ,\nwhich must be specified at time of order and SK will grant Mapei exclusivity\nto the AROVAC bag for its industry (cement based tile adhesives).”\n      Mapei responded to the price quotation with a letter of intent to SK in\nDecember, expressing Mapei’s desire to purchase one Arovac “on a trial basis\nper your quotation” and requesting “every effort to deliver” the Arovac by May\n1, 2007. Mapei viewed the letter as evincing an intent to buy a single pilot\nmachine for demonstration to the big-box retailer, which it could scale up if\n(and only if) it obtained a written commitment from the retailer. But SK\nviewed the letter of intent consistent with a commitment from Mapei to buy a\ncertain (unspecified) number of machines because Mapei’s commitment was\ncontingent on the first Arovac—still only a prototype—working.\n      2. The Production Delays and Division\n      On March 17, 2007, SK, Arodo, and Mapei had a meeting where they\ndiscussed several design issues with the Arovac and agreed that Mapei would\nwork with SK to finalize engineering details by the end of the month. They\nalso discussed delivery dates for several Arovacs and agreed to divide delivery\ninto essentially two phases. The first phase involved a commitment by SK and\nArodo to deliver an initial Arovac to Mapei by December 2007—seven months\nafter the date initially requested by Mapei—with a commitment to deliver\nthree additional machines by February 2008.       The second phase involved\ndelivery of a quantity of subsequent machines to be later specified by Mapei.\nWhile all sides agree that this division occurred, they offer competing reasons\n                                      4\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nfor it. In SK’s view, the division was Mapei’s response to Arodo’s demand for\na commitment to purchase a number of machines as the Arovac prototype\nneared perfection, lest SK and Arodo begin to market the Arovac to others. But\nin Mapei’s view, the division was SK and Arodo’s attempt to mitigate the\ndamage that their delays in perfecting the prototype Arovac caused Mapei—\nnamely, thwarting its efforts to obtain a new contract with the big-box retailer\nand pushing back delivery dates for any subsequent machines Mapei might\nneed in order to scale up in the event it obtained that contract.\n       3. The Beginning of the CapEx Process and the Price Quotation\n       On May 1, 2007, Mapei requested that SK provide “specific items, most\nof which are machine dimensions, drawings, delivery dates, and other contract\nspecifics . . . to submit the CapEx[ 2] for internal approval.” The next day, Mapei\nrequested that SK submit a revised price quotation to reflect the finalized\nengineering details and a more detailed cost structure to “allow [Mapei] to\nprocure this equipment for all our North American plant operations where this\nequipment is applicable (approximately 12-15 machines).”\n       As SK prepared its revised price quotation, SK pressed Mapei to specify\nthe number of Arovacs that Mapei intended to purchase for delivery in phase\ntwo. SK also pressed Mapei to ensure that Mapei’s purchase order specified\nthe quantity of subsequent machines.                “If the guarantee for subsequent\nmachine[s] is not included in your [purchase order],” SK wrote, “Mapei shall\nnot obtain exclusivity.” On May 14th, Mapei informed SK that “it is a little too\n\n\n\n       2“CapEx” refers to Mapei’s internal capital expenditure process. Under that process,\nonce a price quotation like SK’s is received, the quotation and supporting documentation\n(such as drawings and specifications) are attached to a form describing the project and its\nprojected economic costs and benefits to obtain various approvals. If a project is over €10,000,\napproval must be obtained from Mapei’s United States CapEx team as well as Dr. Giorgio\nSquinzi, the chief executive officer, chairman, and majority shareholder of Mapei’s Italian\nparent company. Only after all the necessary approvals are obtained may a purchase order\nbe issued.\n                                               5\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nsoon to give you a final answer [on the number of Arovacs] since we need\napproval from our Italian colleagues[ 3],” but “if you want a number th[e]n you\ncan put down 2/quarter, assuming again that the equipment will perform as\nplanned.” The next day SK submitted its revised price quotation to Mapei.\nThe revised price quotation’s exclusivity provision (the 13-Arovac exclusivity\nprovision) stated that “[i]f the first machine operates as specified in this order,\nMapei agrees and is committed to purchase [13] subsequent machines” (i.e.,\nthe three Arovacs slated for delivery in February, plus ten subsequent\nmachines delivered at a rate of two machines per quarter during 2008 and\n2009).\n      Less than a week later, on May 21, Mapei asked SK to make a handful\nof changes, all technical in nature, to SK’s revised price quotation. Three of\nthe requested changes are on the same page on which the exclusivity provision\nis located. But Mapei did not request any change to that provision. On June\n4, SK sent Mapei a second revised price quotation “per [Mapei’s] comments”\n(the Price Quotation). The Price Quotation contained an exclusivity provision\nthat, other than being limited to North America (the area covered by SK’s\nDistributorship Agreement with Mapei), was in all material respects identical\nto the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision in the initial revised price quotation. A\nweek after submitting the Price Quotation, SK inquired as to the status of a\npurchase order from Mapei and was advised that “the owner of the\ncompany . . . will review the CapEx and as soon as this is done, we will issue\nthe [purchase order].”\n      4. The CapEx Approval and Mapei-SK Purchase Order\n      As the Price Quotation made its way through Mapei’s CapEx process,\nMapei noticed the quantities for several pieces of optional equipment to be\n\n\n      3   This was apparently a reference to Dr. Squinzi.\n                                              6\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\nincluded with the Arovac were wrong and notified SK. SK agreed that the\nquantity for those pieces of equipment would need to change from one to two,\nand advised Mapei that the changes would increase the Arovac’s total price by\nless than 2%, from €709,090 to €722,440. With SK’s agreement on the “exact\noptional equipment” and on “final pricing,” CapEx was “fully approved” on\nJune 21. On June 22, Mapei issued a purchase order for one Arovac and two\nof each of the discussed pieces of optional equipment (the Mapei-SK Purchase\nOrder). The Mapei-SK Purchase Order was “based on” the Price Quotation,\nbut was much shorter in length and omitted many of the provisions included\nin the Price Quotation, including the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision. Similar\nto Mapei’s letter of intent, the Mapei-SK Purchase Order for only one Arovac\nwas not necessarily inconsistent with the Price Quotation’s 13-Arovac\nexclusivity provision because that provision was contingent on the first Arovac\nworking.\n      5. The Initial SK-Arodo Purchase Order\n      After receiving the Mapei-SK Purchase Order, SK submitted its own\npurchase order to Arodo for the first Arovac on June 24. Similar to the Price\nQuotation, SK’s purchase order included a provision captioned “Exclusivity,”\nwhich stated that, “[i]f the first machine operates as specified in this order, SK\nagrees to purchase [13] subsequent machines” and “Arodo will grant SK\nexclusivity [as distributor] . . . for Mapei’s industry, specifically cement based\ntile adhesives,” in North America.\n      6. The Order Confirmation and Mapei-SK Purchase Order Revision\n      The following day, June 25, SK submitted an order confirmation to\nMapei (the Order Confirmation). The Order Confirmation listed the price of\nthe Arovac (with optional equipment) as €722,440, and included an exclusivity\nprovision that was in all material respects the same as the 13-Arovac\nexclusivity provision in the Price Quotation.\n                                        7\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\n      Mapei issued a revised purchase order to SK to reflect an updated Euro\nconversion rate on June 26 and made the first of several payments to SK for\nthe single prototype Arovac the next day.\n      7. The Arovac Installation and Subsequent SK-Arodo Purchase Orders\n      Over the succeeding months, the parties worked to finalize the design\nand delivery of the four phase-one Arovacs slated for delivery in December\n2007 and February 2008. In November 2007, the parties conducted a test of\nthe first Arovac at Arodo’s Belgium plant, which was mostly successful, and\nthe machine was shipped to Mapei. After the test, the parties agreed to delay\ndelivery dates for the three other Arovacs (machine 2 was scheduled for\ndelivery in April and machines 3 and 4 were scheduled for delivery in June)\nand agreed that Mapei would place a down payment for those machines by\nFebruary 15. The parties also discussed, but failed to agree on, a request by\nMapei for an expanded exclusive arrangement beyond cement-based tile\nadhesives.\n      The first Arovac was installed and accepted by Mapei in January 2008,\nand on February 11, SK sent Arodo a purchase order for the three remaining\nphase-one machines (together with the June 24 purchase order, the SK-Arodo\nPurchase Orders). 4 The February 11 purchase order contained an exclusivity\nprovision similar to the one contained in the June 24 purchase order.\n      8. Mapei’s Requests to Delay Subsequent Machines\n      Shortly thereafter, Mapei sought and obtained several extensions for\ndown payment on the three remaining phase-one machines. The stated reason\nfor the extensions was that Mapei had only ordered one Arovac and down\npayments or purchase orders for additional Arovacs could not be made or\n\n\n      4 Mapei made several revisions to the February 11 purchase order, the latest revision\nbeing March 28. We do not, however, separately address those revisions because neither\nparty contends they are material to our analysis.\n                                            8\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\nplaced until a new contract was reached with the big-box retailer. Mapei\nsought and obtained the first extension from SK, but requested subsequent\nextensions directly from Arodo. At the same time, Mapei requested that Arodo\nestablish an exclusive arrangement directly with it covering additional product\nsegments beyond cement-based tile adhesives.\n      In May, SK, Arodo, and Mapei had a meeting, during which Mapei\nrenewed its request for an expanded exclusive arrangement beyond cement-\nbased tile adhesives.   When the parties began to discuss the number of\nadditional Arovacs that Mapei would need to commit to buy to obtain that\nexclusivity, the discussion quickly became very confrontational. SK took the\nposition that any number less than 13 Arovacs over two years was a request to\nabandon an existing agreement on exclusivity for one with worse terms, while\nMapei took the position that it had only issued a purchase order for a single\nArovac and, thus, was not committed to purchase any additional Arovacs.\n      SK responded to the meeting with a May 29 letter from its attorney to\nMapei proposing an “amendment to the [parties’] agreement under which\nMapei would purchase a minimum of nine . . . additional machines over the\nnext three . . . years” in exchange for an exclusive arrangement covering more\nthan just cement-based tile adhesives. The letter also stated that it served as\nSK’s last request for a down payment on machines two through four, which\nwere in production. Two days later, on May 31, Mapei reiterated that it could\nnot make any down payments or submit any additional purchase orders until\nit had a written agreement with the big-box retailer it had lost several years\nago, which it hoped to do soon.\n      Soon after, without any payment from Mapei, Arodo demanded that SK\nmake a down payment on the three remaining phase-one Arovacs that were in\nproduction, which SK did.\n\n\n                                       9\n\f                                No. 16-10430\n      9. Mapei’s Purchase of Subsequent Machines from Arodo\n      On June 13, 2008, Mapei obtained a new contract with the big-box\nretailer that it had lost several years before. Three days later, on June 16,\nMapei informed SK that, in view of the recent communications from SK and\nits attorney (which Mapei claims were threats by SK to sue it), it would limit\nsubsequent communication to Arodo or through the parties’ legal counsel.\nLater that same day, Mapei renewed its discussions with Arodo over an\nexclusive arrangement directly between them.         A “key point” of that\narrangement from Mapei’s perspective was that Arodo reach an agreement\nwith SK that “keeps [SK] away from Mapei” because Mapei had “no desire to\ninteract with [SK].” After a July meeting between Mapei and Arodo, a business\nadvisor working on behalf of Arodo (who attended the July meeting) informed\nSK that Mapei did not wish to work with SK anymore and that Arodo would\ndeal directly with Mapei. The business advisor also informed SK that if the\nparties could not finalize the paperwork for a series of related agreements by\nSeptember 1 that contained (among other things) a commitment that SK not\nsue Mapei in exchange for a commission on the Arovacs that Arodo sold to\nMapei, his “suggestion [wa]s that Arodo and SK will go their ‘own way.’”\n      SK refused to commit to such an agreement, but Arodo and SK did not\nimmediately go their own way. The parties continued to work together under\nthe Distributorship Agreement until Arodo was served with the present suit in\nMarch 2010, at which time Arodo informed SK that “cooperation between SK\nand Arodo is finished.” However, after SK’s refusal to reach an agreement with\nArodo on Mapei, Arodo and Mapei dealt directly with each other. In late 2008,\nArodo sold the three remaining phase-one Arovacs to Mapei, and in February\n2009, Arodo entered into a formal exclusivity agreement with Mapei (which\ncovered product segments beyond cement-based tile adhesives). Later that\nyear, Arodo formally recalled “any exclusivity” SK had been granted to sell\n                                     10\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nArovacs in North America. Arodo ultimately sold six additional Arovacs (nine\ntotal) directly to Mapei. SK did not receive any compensation from Arodo’s\ndirect sales to Mapei, other than Arodo returning to SK the down payment it\nplaced for the three phase-one Arovacs.\nB. Procedural History\n       SK filed suit against Arodo and Mapei in Texas state court on January\n21, 2010, asserting, inter alia, claims for breach of contract and tortious\ninterference with an existing contract against both. 5 With respect to Mapei,\nSK alleged that it breached an agreement to purchase 14 Arovacs (reflected in\nthe Price Quotation and Order Confirmation) and that it tortiously interfered\nwith two related agreements SK had with Arodo: (1) the Distributorship\nAgreement and (2) an agreement established by the SK-Arodo Purchase\nOrders guaranteeing SK exclusivity in Mapei’s industry (i.e., cement-based tile\nadhesives). SK’s claims against Arodo largely mirrored its claims against\nMapei. SK alleged a tortious interference claim against Arodo for its alleged\ninterference with SK’s contract with Mapei to purchase 14 Arovacs, as well as\na claim for breach of two related agreements: (1) the Distributorship\nAgreement and (2) an agreement established by the SK-Arodo Purchase\nOrders guaranteeing SK exclusivity in Mapei’s industry (i.e., cement-based tile\nadhesives).\n       Mapei removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity\njurisdiction, where Arodo moved to compel arbitration of SK’s claims against\nit based on the broad arbitration agreement in the SK-Arodo Purchase Orders.\nThe district court granted Arodo’s motion and stayed further proceedings\n\n\n\n       5 Among SK’s other claims was one for fraud against Mapei. The district court granted\nMapei’s Rule 50(a) motion on that claim, and on appeal, SK “conditionally seeks a new trial”\non that claim in the event this court affirms the district court’s grant of a new trial. Because\nwe reverse the district court’s grant of a new trial, we do not address SK’s fraud claim.\n                                              11\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\npending the resolution of SK’s claims against Arodo in arbitration.                  The\narbitration occurred before the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris\non June 21, 2013. In the final award, the arbitrator found, inter alia, that\nArodo did not breach the Distributorship Agreement by directly selling Arovacs\nto Mapei or commit an “abuse of right” by terminating that agreement in\nMarch 2010 precisely because the Distributorship Agreement was non-\nexclusive and of an indefinite duration. But the arbitrator did find that Arodo\n“severely breached” the exclusivity it granted to SK as distributor for Mapei’s\nindustry in the SK-Arodo Purchase Orders and did tortiously interfere with a\n“valid contract” between SK and Mapei to purchase 14 Arovacs by contracting\ndirectly with Mapei for subsequent Arovacs. The arbitrator also found SK was\nentitled to damages for both the breach and the tortious interference and\nawarded SK €491,634 in damages on its breach of contract claim, representing\nthe lost profits on machines 2 through 4 (€533,535) less the deposit Arodo\nreturned to SK on those machines (€41,901). 6 The arbitrator declined to award\ndamages on machines 5 through 14 or for related service charges because SK\nhad not proved “known added value” for them, as required to “receive\ncompensation under Article 3 of the Belgian Law of 27 July 1961.”\n      SK then moved in the district court to reopen the proceedings against\nMapei and Arodo. After re-opening the case, the district court dismissed SK’s\nremaining claims against Arodo under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b). 7\nThe district court thereafter denied SK and Mapei’s competing motions for\nsummary judgment on SK’s claims against Mapei for breach of contract and\ntortious interference with an existing contract claim, and those claims\n\n\n      6   The arbitrator did not separately award damages on SK’s tortious interference\nclaims (despite finding SK was entitled to damages) because these damages were included in\nthe breach of contract award. The arbitrator did, however, separately award SK two thirds\nof the cost of arbitration and legal fees.\n        7 SK did not appeal this dismissal, and it is not at issue in this appeal.\n\n                                           12\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nproceeded to a jury trial. At the close of SK’s case in chief, Mapei moved for\njudgment as a matter of law (JMOL) pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 50(a) on both of those claims, which the district court denied.\nFollowing the week-long trial, the jury found that Mapei breached a contract\nwith SK to purchase more than one Arovac and that Mapei tortiously\ninterfered with SK’s contractual relationship with Arodo. The jury awarded\nroughly $1.5 million to SK for breach of contract and roughly $6.1 million to\nSK for tortious interference (including over $2.7 million in punitive damages).\n      The district court requested post-verdict briefing, asking the parties to\naddress whether there was “evidence indicating the owner of Mapei[ 8] gave his\nauthorization to purchase more than one Arovac machine from [SK,] . . . along\nwith everything else that you want to address.” Mapei subsequently filed a\nrenewed motion for JMOL under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) on both\nSK’s breach of contract and tortious interference with an existing contract\nclaims, raising a number of different reasons why JMOL was appropriate,\nincluding an absence of evidence of authority by anyone to bind Mapei to\ncontract to purchase more than one Arovac. Alternatively, Mapei moved for a\nnew trial pursuant to Rule 59. In response, SK argued, inter alia, that Mapei\nwaived the issue of lack of authority by not raising the issue in its Rule 50(a)\nmotion and that the jury’s findings, in any event, had sufficient legal and\nfactual support. After requesting and receiving additional briefing on whether\nSK was required to specifically plead apparent authority, the court granted\nMapei’s renewed JMOL motion, setting aside the jury verdict for those\n“reasons set forth in Mapei’s [renewed JMOL motion], together with Mapei’s\npost-verdict briefs.”      The district court also conditionally granted Mapei’s\nrequest for a new trial “for the reason that the verdict of the jury on [SK’s\n\n\n      8   The reference was apparently to Dr. Squinzi.\n                                             13\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\nbreach of contract and tortious interference claims] is against the great weight\nand preponderance of the evidence.”\n                 II. JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW\n      The district court granted JMOL on both SK’s breach of contract and\ntortious interference with an existing contract claims. Because the reasons\nasserted in Mapei’s renewed JMOL motion differed as to each claim, we\naddress each one separately. But, first, we address the appropriate standard\nof review.\nA. Standard of Review\n      When a case is tried to a jury, a renewed motion for JMOL under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 50(b) “is a challenge to the legal sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting the jury’s verdict.” Cowart v.

In Mapei’s view, the Mapei-SK\nPurchase Order was the offer, which SK accepted with the Order\nConfirmation. 11\n       a.

Fields & Co. v. U.S. Steel Int’l,\nInc., 426 F. App’x 271, 276 (5th Cir. 2011). Despite this general rule, a price\nquotation can constitute an offer if, under the totality of the circumstances, it\nleads the recipient reasonably to believe that assent to the quotation is all that\nis needed to ripen the quotation into a contract.

See Tex.\nBus. & Com. Code Ann. § 2.207(b)(2).\n                                             16\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\n       In this case, each of these factors weighs in favor of the jury’s implied\nfinding that the Price Quotation was an offer. First, the Price Quotation was\nhighly detailed, totaling more than 50 pages and containing all the necessary\nelements for a contract.        Second, the Price Quotation was not the initial\nsubstantive contact between the parties. Rather, as detailed supra, the Price\nQuotation followed numerous meetings and communications between the\nparties over the nearly ten-month period between August 2006 and June 2007,\nwhich resulted in two separate sets of revisions. Finally, the Price Quotation\nwas not a generalized quote sent to a number of potential customers, “such as\none appearing in a brochure or on a flyer.” J.D. Fields, 426 F. App’x at 276. It\nwas prepared and revised twice specifically for Mapei, at Mapei’s request.\n       The home office acceptance clause in the Price Quotation’s lengthy terms\nand conditions section—stating that “[a]ll quotations, orders and agreements\nmade between [Mapei] and [SK]’s [agent] shall be subject to the acceptance and\napproval of [SK]’s headquarters”—certainly does undermine the jury’s implied\nfinding that the quotation was an offer. 12 See id. at 279 (recognizing a home\noffice approval clause will prevent the formation of a contract when it is\nintended as a condition precedent to contract formation); see also, e.g.,\nNordyne, 262 F.3d at 847. But we cannot say, as Mapei urges, that it prevented\nthe Price Quotation from constituting an offer as a matter of law. See Crest\nRidge Constr. Grp., Inc. v. Newcourt Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"8590\"><a href=\"/opinion/8590/crest-ridge-const-group-inc-v-newcourt-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (5th Cir. 1996)\n(concluding that a clause in a price quotation stating it was subject to credit\ndepartment approval did not prevent it from being an offer as a matter of law).\n“[I]n light of the extensive dealings and preparations between these two\nparties, the jury could conclude this [home office approval] clause at most\n\n\n\n        SK’s co-owner explained at trial that the provision was drafted by SK’s attorney and\n       12\n\nmistakenly excludes the word “agent” after the first reference to SK.\n                                            17\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\ncreated a condition precedent on [SK]’s obligation to perform and did not\nprevent the formation of a contract.” Id. Indeed, the evidence showed that the\nPrice Quotation was already approved by SK’s “corporate headquarters”; it was\nprepared by SK’s co-owner at, and sent directly from, SK’s Texas headquarters.\nSee Nordyne, 262 F.3d at 846.\n      While the parties’ explanations of “industry custom . . . in this case are\nrelevant to the issue of reasonableness, the UCC never informs that industry\ncustom and course of dealing are alone determinative of the issue of contract\nformation.” J.D. Fields, 426 F. App’x at 280 (emphasis omitted). As such, we\ndo not believe SK’s testimony on industry practice—namely, that a purchase\norder must “kiss” an order confirmation to form a contract—means that the\nPrice Quotation was not an offer as a matter of law. See id. Indeed, Mapei’s\nown CapEx process, which requires all “contract specifics” to be submitted for\napproval, suggests that it viewed the Price Quotation as an offer. Viewing the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, there was legally\nsufficient evidence for the jury to impliedly conclude that the Price Quotation\nwas an offer.\n      b. The Acceptance\n      Under     the   UCC,    “[a]     definite   and   seasonable   expression   of\nacceptance . . . operates    as   an     acceptance     even   though    it   states\nterms . . . different from those offered.” Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann. § 2.207(a).\nThus, unlike the “mirror image” rule at common law, the mere fact that a\nmerchant’s acceptance form contains materially different terms than the offer\ndoes not mean that it will be considered a rejection or counter-offer.

Henkel Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788749\"><a href=\"/opinion/788749/gage-products-co-v-henkel-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 642 (6th Cir. 2004).\n                                           18\n\f                                     No. 16-10430\n           Here, the Purchase Order unquestionably contained different terms\nfrom the Price Quotation: it omitted many of the provisions included in the\nPrice Quotation, including the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision, and identified\nquantities of “2” instead of “1” for several optional items to be included with\nthe Arovac. 13 Under one view of the facts, these differences, particularly the\nomission of the 13-Arovac exclusivity provision, suggest that Mapei’s decision\nto send the Purchase Order for only one Arovac was an unambiguous rejection\nof the Price Quotation’s offer. This view is bolstered by SK’s May 7, 2007 email\nto Mapei indicating that Mapei’s purchase order must include a “guarantee for\nsubsequent machine[s]” for Mapei to obtain exclusivity.            It finds further\nsupport in the fact that, if Mapei accepted the Price Quotation’s 13-Arovac\nexclusivity provision (and SK’s construction that it obligated Mapei to buy 13\nArovacs), Mapei would be required to make a substantial capital investment of\nnearly $14 million in Arovacs without any commitment from the big-box\nretailer, which it understandably would be hesitant to do.\n       Yet, an alternative view of the facts suggests that Mapei’s Purchase\nOrder did manifest acceptance of the Price Quotation, even though the terms\nof the two materially differed. As an initial matter, a purchase order for more\nthan one Arovac was neither “expect[ed]” nor would “make any sense” under\nthe circumstances because the Price Quotation’s exclusivity provision was\ncontingent on the first Arovac working. Moreover, SK’s May 7, 2007 email to\nMapei preceded Mapei’s May 14, 2007 email indicating that, if SK wanted to\nspecify the number of machines in the Price Quotation (that it submitted the\nfollowing day), “th[e]n [SK] can put down 2/quarter, assuming again that the\nequipment will perform as planned.” Finally, despite the substantial capital\n\n\n\n       13   Specifically, “Quick Removable Augers,” a “Handle Former,” and an “I-mark\nreader.”\n                                          19\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\ninvestment required by SK’s construction of the 13-Arovac exclusivity\nprovision, a reasonable jury could have concluded that such an investment was\nnecessary on Mapei’s part to prevent its competitors from obtaining the Arovac\nand, thereby, potentially securing a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict, we cannot\nconclude there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for the jury’s implied\nacceptance of this latter view.\n       2. Contract Construction\n       Mapei argued in its renewed motion for JMOL that, even if the Price\nQuotation was an offer and its Purchase Order the acceptance, the Price\nQuotation’s exclusivity provision did not, in fact, require Mapei to purchase 13\nadditional Arovacs.       Rather, it simply provided that, in order to obtain\nexclusivity, Mapei had to buy 13 additional Arovacs. 14 Accordingly, Mapei\nasked the district court to construe the provision as a matter of law in its favor.\n       The Price Quotation’s exclusivity provision states in plain terms that,\n“[i]f the first machine operates as specified in this order, Mapei agrees and is\ncommitted to purchase [13] subsequent machines” and “SK will grant Mapei\nexclusivity to the Arovac . . . for its industry.” The fact that this statement\nappears under the heading of “Exclusivity” does not compel construction in\nMapei’s favor, as it urges. The heading merely reflects that the promise by\nMapei to purchase 13 Arovacs and the promise by SK to grant exclusivity are\nreciprocal.    It does not, however, indicate whether they are independent\n\n\n\n\n       14 It is not entirely clear whether, under Mapei’s proposed construction, exclusivity\nwould (1) first attach when all 14 Arovacs were purchased or (2) end when Mapei stopped\npurchasing Arovacs according to the contemplated schedule. Because the first construction\nwould not make commercial sense—it would require Mapei to forfeit any potential edge and\nrisk serious exposure by having to wait two years before obtaining exclusivity—we presume\nit intended the latter construction, despite contrary testimony from at least one of its\nemployees.\n                                            20\n\f                                  No. 16-10430\npromises (i.e., Mapei must buy 13 Arovacs and SK must grant exclusivity,\nregardless of whether the other performs) or are dependent promises (i.e., SK\nmust grant exclusivity so long as Mapei continues to buy 13 Arovacs over the\nspecified two-year period). The fact that the only conditional language in the\n13-Arovac exclusivity provision relates to the first Arovac operating as\nspecified suggests that the former construction is the correct one. Indeed, in\nits motion for summary judgment and in its Rule 50(a) motion, Mapei\neffectively conceded as much, arguing that the virtually identical exclusivity\nclause in SK’s Order Confirmation transformed Mapei’s purchase order for one\nmachine into a commitment to purchase 14 machines and, thus, increased the\nprice of Mapei’s order by approximately $13 million. Accordingly, Mapei’s\nrequest to now construe the Price Quotation’s 13-Arovac exclusivity provision\nin its favor must be rejected.

In response, Mapei filed a\nrenewed motion for JMOL, raising this lack-of-authority argument for the first\ntime. Mapei did argue in its initial motion for JMOL (and its motion for\nsummary judgment, which it purported to incorporate by reference) that there\nwas not a “meeting of the minds” as to more than one Arovac, but critically\n\n\n\n\n                                        21\n\f                                      No. 16-10430\nnever raised the distinct issue of authority. 15 See, e.g., Anland N., L.P. v.

Thus, the principal question we must answer is\nwhether there is any evidence to demonstrate the CapEx submitted was for\nthe purchase of 14 Arovacs, rather than one Arovac.\n      The evidence presented at trial on the issue was thin.

So is the fact that Mapei issued a purchase\norder for only one Arovac, especially in the face of SK’s request that Mapei’s\n“guarantee for subsequent machine[s]” be included in the purchase order.\n      Yet, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s verdict\nas we must, we cannot say that there is no evidence that Mapei’s board and\n                                       23\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nDr. Squinzi approved the purchase of 14 Arovacs. An exclusive arrangement\nwith SK was admittedly critical to Mapei’s efforts to win back its lost contract\nand it was reasonably understood that, in order to obtain such an arrangement,\nMapei would ultimately be required to buy more than one Arovac from SK.\nMoreover, the conduct of the employees principally tasked with submitting the\nCapEx is consistent with Mapei committing to purchase more than one Arovac\n(e.g., discussing delivery dates, discounts, and product designs for subsequent\nmachines with SK before any purchase order was approved for those\nmachines). Finally, the fact that the Mapei-SK Purchase Order related to only\na single Arovac was not necessarily inconsistent with the purchase of 14\nArovacs because the purchase of the remaining 13 was contingent on the first\none working.       Given the plain error standard of review, which considers\nwhether there is any evidence to support the jury’s implied finding of authority,\nthe jury’s verdict must be respected.\n       4. Texas’s One–Satisfaction Rule\n       As an alternative basis for affirming, Mapei asserts that SK is barred\nfrom recovering on its breach of contract claim against Mapei because SK has\nalready recovered from Arodo for claims that Arodo interfered with the same\nalleged contract. 16 According to Mapei, at arbitration, the arbitrator found\nthat Arodo tortiously interfered with SK’s contract with Mapei and, consistent\nwith Texas law, awarded SK damages equal to the benefit of its alleged bargain\nwith Mapei—its lost profits. Because SK already recovered its lost profits from\nArodo on this contract, Mapei asserts the one-satisfaction rule precludes SK\nfrom recovering more lost profits from it.\n\n\n       16 In its renewed motion for JMOL, Mapei raised the one-satisfaction rule, but only as\nto SK’s tortious interference claim. Mapei did, however, previously raise the one-satisfaction\nrule as to SK’s breach of contract in its motion for summary (which it purported to incorporate\ninto its Rule 50(a) motion). Because Mapei’s argument is meritless, we need not parse\nwhether de novo or plain error review is more appropriate under this circumstance.\n                                             24\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n      In the arbitration, SK did recover damages from Arodo, but these\ndamages only related to Mapei’s purchase of machines 2 through 4 on account\nof intricacies in Belgian damages law that Mapei does not expound upon in its\nbriefing. In this case, governed by Texas law, the jury apparently heeded\nMapei’s repeated assertions that SK had already been compensated for\nmachines 2 through 4 and awarded damages for only machines 5 through 14;\nits award was for an amount less than requested by SK and in line with the\nprofits SK could have reasonably stood to gain from only machines 5 through\n14. Thus, there is no double-recovery in this case or, consequently, any role for\nthe one-satisfaction rule. See, e.g., Coastal Agric. Supply, Inc. v.

The jury reasonably selected\none of those alternatives. Therefore, we discern no basis for setting aside the\njury’s verdict on SK’s breach of contract claim.\nC. Tortious Interference\n      As discussed supra, SK alleged that its contractual relationship with\nArodo had two components: (1) an exclusive distributorship for SK to sell to\nMapei pursuant to the SK-Arodo Purchase Orders and (2) a non-exclusive\ndistributorship for SK to sell to North American customers pursuant to the\nDistributorship Agreement. In its renewed motion for JMOL, Mapei asserted\nthat SK had provided legally insufficient evidence to demonstrate that Mapei’s\nalleged interference caused SK any damages. Specifically, Mapei argued that\n                                       25\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\nSK had failed to provide anything beyond unsupported speculation that it\nwould have sold more than the 14 Arovacs which it contracted with Mapei to\nresell through its contractual relationship with Arodo.                 Therefore, Mapei\nargued, SK was limited to its breach of contract recovery (i.e., the profits it\nwould have earned from buying the 14 Arovacs from Arodo and reselling them\nto Mapei at a marked-up price). On this point, we agree with Mapei. 17\n       SK was not guaranteed any profit from its contractual relationship with\nArodo. Under that relationship, SK was merely entitled to buy Arovacs from\nArodo and resell them at a marked-up price to third-parties, like Mapei. Thus,\nthe only potential damages SK suffered from Mapei’s interference with its\ncontractual relationship with Arodo were lost profits it would have derived\nfrom sales to third-parties. SK produced two experts at trial to quantify the\nvalue of the lost profits it suffered. The first expert, an accountant, testified to\nthe profits SK would have earned from its sale of the 14 Arovacs to Mapei (i.e.,\nthe damage SK suffered from Mapei’s breach of contract). The second expert,\nan economist, testified to lost profits SK would have earned from sales to other\ncompanies (i.e., the damage SK suffered from Mapei’s alleged tortious\ninterference). Mapei challenges this second expert’s testimony—the principal,\nif not sole, basis for the jury’s lost profits award on SK’s tortious interference\nclaim—as nothing more than unsupported speculation.\n       For a plaintiff to recover lost profits, there must a causal relationship\nbetween the amount of lost profits suffered by the plaintiff and the defendant’s\nactions.

With\nrespect to the second step, SK’s economic expert estimated that SK would sell\nseven machines per year. That estimate, however, was based on nothing more\nthan speculation.   It was not supported by any empirical analysis or any\nevidence outside of the tripartite relationship between SK, Arodo, and Mapei\n(e.g., real-world sales, customer surveys, or current market demand).\n                                       27\n\f                                 No. 16-10430\n      As justification for his estimate, SK’s economic expert cited SK’s contract\nwith Mapei to purchase 14 machines over two years and emails between Mapei\nand Arodo dickering over exclusivity, in which Mapei indicates Arodo could\n“sell dozens of [Arovacs] in [certain product segments] with adequate\nrepresentation and technical support.” But neither piece of evidence takes the\nexpert’s estimate of seven machines per year out of the realm of mere\nspeculation.   Beyond the obvious fact that the existence of the SK-Mapei\ncontract was bitterly contested, the contract was clearly the result of Mapei’s\nunique demand in 2006 and 2007, which was created by Mapei’s efforts to\nobtain a new contract with the big-box retailer. Thus, the SK-Mapei contract\ndoes not provide any evidence that SK would have obtained similar contracts\nin the future (let alone that SK did not obtain those contracts on account of\nMapei’s alleged interference).

Although this inquiry may be some evidence of demand\nfor the Arovac, it is no evidence of lost profits SK suffered from Mapei’s breach\nor alleged interference. According to the testimony of one of SK’s co-owners,\nthe inquiring company was a direct competitor of Mapei’s and, therefore,\ncovered under the exclusivity provision in SK’s contract with Mapei. Thus, the\n2009 inquiry could not have yielded a contract even in the absence of Mapei’s\nbreach or alleged interference. 19 The 2009 inquiry then cannot constitute\nreasonably certain evidence of SK’s lost profits in this case.\n       With legally insufficient evidence to support an award of damages\nbeyond those that SK suffered as a result of Mapei’s breach of contract, we\naffirm the district court’s decision to grant JMOL on SK’s claim for tortious\ninterference with an existing contract and its related claim for punitive\n\n\n\n\n       18 Indeed, the objective sales data we could locate in the record suggests that Arodo\nhas only sold 12 fully operational Arovacs ever. The two Arovacs that were not sold to Mapei\nwere also apparently sold by SK, so there is no lost profits attributable to them. Both of those\npurchasers, however, appear to have had a dispute with SK and no longer buy from SK.\n       19 Although SK’s other co-owner seemed to testify that SK could have sold to the\n\ncompany after 2009—when he asserted exclusivity ended—there is nothing in the plain\nlanguage of the exclusivity clause that supports termination of the exclusivity granted to\nMapei at the end of 2009. SK, just like Mapei, is bound by the construction of the exclusivity\nprovision outlined supra.\n                                              29\n\f                                       No. 16-10430\ndamages. 20 See Bellefonte Underwriters Ins. v.
