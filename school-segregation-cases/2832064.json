Thomas Leonard appeals the judgment of the district court granting\nsummary judgment to the defendant, Stephen Robinson, in this civil rights action resulting from\nLeonard’s arrest at a township board meeting. The district court dismissed the case, holding that\nRobinson was entitled to qualified immunity on claims for wrongful arrest and that Leonard could\nnot make out a prima facie case on his claim for First Amendment retaliation in violation of his civil\nrights. We reverse both holdings. The district court’s application of state law to Leonard’s conduct\noverlooked the First Amendment and its evaluation of Leonard’s retaliation claim ignored evidence\nindicating that Robinson did have an improper motive. We hold that 1) no reasonable officer would\nhave found probable cause to arrest Leonard solely for uttering “God damn” while addressing the\ntownship board because the First Amendment protects this sort of uninhibited debate, and\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                      Page 2\n\n\n2) Leonard’s retaliation claim survives summary judgment because Robinson’s motive for the arrest\nis a genuine issue of material fact in dispute.\n                                                  I\n        This case presents the question of whether an arrest for obscenity, vulgarity, or disturbing\nthe peace, when based upon speech and not conduct, is valid when it occurs during a democratic\nassembly where there is no evidence that the individual arrested was out of order and some evidence\nof improper motive by the arresting officer. With due regard to the procedural disposition of the\ncase, the facts are here recounted in the light most favorable to Leonard.\n        Leonard’s wife Sarah operates a towing company called Leonard’s Auto Works. Auto\nWorks was the exclusive towing company for the township of Montrose, Michigan until around\n2000. At that time, the Montrose Township Chief of Police, Charles Abraham, was promoting his\nown plan with the city board to extend township police jurisdiction to include the city of Montrose\nas well as the surrounding township. Agnes Johnson, Sarah Leonard’s mother, was a member of the\nCity Council and opposed Abraham’s plan. Abraham asked Sarah to lobby her mother in support\nof the plan. In return, he offered, Auto Works could continue to tow for the Township. When Sarah\nrefused, Auto Works lost its business with the Township. Sarah sued the Township and Chief\nAbraham in Genesee County Circuit Court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violating her First\nAmendment rights. The case was removed to federal court and settled in February 2003. Leonard\nv. Montrose, No. 02-71084 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 11, 2003) (stipulation dismissing case). As a result of\nthe lawsuit, according to Leonard, Chief Abraham hated him and his wife.\n        Before the settlement, on October 15, 2002, Thomas, Sarah, and their child attended a\nTownship Board meeting. Officer Robinson testified that he was ordered by Chief Abraham to\nattend the meeting. Thomas Leonard believes that Abraham ordered Robinson to attend so that he\nmight arrest Sarah in retaliation for her suit against him. Much of the meeting was recorded on\nvideotape. When he arrived, Robinson took his seat at the back of the meeting hall because he\n“do[esn’t] really like anyone behind [him].” Near the beginning of the meeting, Robinson was asked\nby another attendee why he, a police officer, was present. Robinson lied in response—he did not\ndisclose that the Chief had ordered him to attend. Instead, he said, “I’d like to see what’s going on.”\n        Later in the meeting, during the portion known as Citizen Time, Sarah addressed the council\nabout the actions the Township had taken that had affected her business: Auto Works was not\nselected for several police car repair contracts, even though it was the low bidder, and Auto Works\nwas no longer called to tow wrecked municipal vehicles. When she finished, Thomas Leonard was\nrecognized by the Township Supervisor, Don Papineau. Thomas arose and spoke:\n       LEONARD:                It’s not right and you guys know it. We want an answer.\n                               We’re sick and tired of getting screwed. You guys are\n                               screwing us and we know it. We’re sitting, the attorneys are\n                               sitting here, he hasn’t read about it, nobody knows nothing\n                               about it. I’m sick of it.\n       PAPINEAU:               I, I disagree that we screwed Leonard’s [Auto Works] or—\n       LEONARD:                You do? Do it right now.\n       PAPINEAU:               Yes, sir, I do.\n       LEONARD:                (inaudible)\n       PAPINEAU:               I disagree with that.\n       LEONARD:                Well, that’s good. That’s why you’re in a God damn\n                               lawsuit—\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                     Page 3\n\n\nThomas then sat down. After he had taken his seat, Papineau said, “Hey, do not use the Lord’s name\nin vain.” Leonard responded, “I’ll do whatever I want, Don, just like you.” At that point, Officer\nRobinson entered the conversation:\n       ROBINSON:               (inaudible)\n       LEONARD:                You stay out of it. I’m not talking to you.\n       ROBINSON:               (inaudible)\n       LEONARD:                No, you come in here, you come here—\n       ROBINSON:               No, I come here as a police officer.\n       LEONARD:                No, you didn’t. Don’t give me a hard time.\n       ROBINSON:               If I’m going to (inaudible) I’m going to take you with me.\n       LEONARD:                I’m ready to go, so, let’s go.\nRobinson took Leonard outside the meeting room and placed him under arrest. Leonard was\ntransported to the police station and charged with violations of Michigan Compiled Laws §§ 750.167\n(disorderly person) and 750.337 (obscenity). He was released after a one-hour detention. One\nmonth later the citation was voided and dismissed.\n        On June 6, 2003, Leonard filed this action against Robinson in his personal capacity in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that Robinson, under color\nof law, violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizure. The complain also\nraised three state law torts: battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment. Robinson filed a motion\nfor summary judgment on November 20, 2003. He argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity\non the constitutional allegations and that the state law claims must be dismissed because the arrest\nwas supported by probable cause. To bolster this claim, Robinson cited two additional Michigan\nstatutes that Leonard may have violated, Michigan Compiled Laws §§ 750.103 (cursing and\nswearing) and 750.170 (disturbance of lawful meetings). Leonard filed a response to the motion,\ndefending his claims under a First Amendment retaliation theory and generally asserting the same\ngrounds he does here on appeal.\n        On May 4, 2005, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed\nthe case. Leonard v. Robinson, No. 03-72199, slip op. at 26 (E.D. Mich.) [hereinafter D. Ct. Op.].\nThe district court held that Robinson did not violate the Fourth Amendment because he had probable\ncause to arrest Leonard. Id. at 7. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\nstate law claims. D. Ct. Op. at 27 n.17. The court found that even though Michigan Compiled Laws\n§ 750.337 (criminalizing indecent language in the presence of women or children) had been\ninvalidated by the Michigan Supreme Court, other statutes, criminalizing conduct for which Leonard\nhad not been charged, supported the arrest, viz., §§ 750.103 (swearing), 750.170 (disturbing a\nmeeting), and 750.167 (disorderly person). Therefore, based upon these statutes, Robinson had\nprobable cause to arrest Leonard because he had violated the plain language of those statutes and\nRobinson was “to enforce laws until and unless they are declared unconstitutional.” D. Ct. Op. at\n12. See also Devenpeck v. Alford, 543 U.S. 146, 153 (2004) (holding that an officer’s subjective\nreason for making an arrest need not include the criminal offense that later establishes probable\ncause).\n        The district court denied Leonard’s First Amendment retaliation claim by holding that there\nwas no “causal connection between Plaintiff’s protected speech and his arrest.” D. Ct. Op. at 25.\nThe court held that our precedents “recognize[] a permissible inference of retaliatory motive in only\na particular category of cases: namely, those cases where all of the possible grounds for arrest arise\nsolely during the course of a citizen’s encounter with a police officer.” Id. at 23 (citing McCurdy\nv. Montgomery County, 240 F.3d 512 (6th Cir. 2001) and Greene v. Barber, 310 F.3d 889 (6th Cir.\n2002)). The court refused to make reasonable inferences favorable to Leonard’s claims. Instead,\nit ignored his allegations regarding Robinson’s motive for the arrest, the previous lawsuit by\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                       Page 4\n\n\nLeonard’s wife, and Robinson’s inconsistent statements and held that “there is absolutely no\nevidence of any improper motive.” D. Ct. Op. at 22. The district court concluded that it was illegal\nto “use[] objectionable language and become[] somewhat belligerent during a public meeting,” id.\nat 27, and that Leonard should have just calmed down and not made a federal case of it.\n                                                  II\n         We review a grant of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds de novo “because\napplication of this doctrine is a question of law.” McCloud v. Testa, 227 F.3d 424, 428 (6th Cir.\n2000) (internal quotation and citations omitted). See also Armstrong v. City of Melvindale, 432 F.3d\n695, 698 (6th Cir. 2006). Summary judgment is appropriate where “the pleadings, depositions,\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\nas a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “The district court, and this [c]ourt in its review of the\ndistrict court, must view the facts and any inferences reasonably drawn from them in the light most\nfavorable to the party against whom judgment was entered.” Kalamazoo Acquisitions, L.L.C. v.\nWestfield Ins. Co., Inc., 395 F.3d 338, 342 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.\nZenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587 (1986)). The party opposing summary judgment cannot rest\non its pleading or allegations, to prevail, they must present material evidence in support of their\nallegations. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). A mere scintilla of evidence is\ninsufficient; “there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the [non-movant].”\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252 (1986).\n                                                  III\n                                                   A\n        “Whether an officer is authorized to make an arrest ordinarily depends, in the first instance,\non state law.” Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 36 (1979) (citing Ker v. California, 374 U.S.\n23 (1963) and Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10 (1948)). As we shall discuss, the laws cited\nby Robinson, in support of the contested arrest, are all state laws. Both parties agree that “[w]here\nprobable cause exists, ‘[a] police officer is permitted to make an arrest without a warrant for a\nmisdemeanor committed in his presence.’” United States v. Reed, 220 F.3d 476, 478 (6th Cir. 2000)\n(quoting United States v. Smith, 73 F.3d 1414, 1416 (6th Cir.1996)).\n        We must independently and objectively determine whether Robinson had probable cause to\narrest Leonard.\n               Our cases make clear that an arresting officer’s state of mind (except for the\n       facts that he knows) is irrelevant to the existence of probable cause. . . . “[T]he\n       Fourth Amendment’s concern with ‘reasonableness’ allows certain actions to be\n       taken in certain circumstances, whatever the subjective intent.” “[E]venhanded law\n       enforcement is best achieved by the application of objective standards of conduct,\n       rather than standards that depend upon the subjective state of mind of the officer.”\nDevenpeck, 543 U.S. at 152–53 (citations omitted). “[P]robable cause determinations involve an\nexamination of all facts and circumstances within an officer’s knowledge at the time of an arrest.”\nEstate of Dietrich v. Burrows, 167 F.3d 1007, 1012 (6th Cir. 1999) (citing Carroll v. United States,\n267 U.S. 132, 162 (1925)).\n       Robinson has asserted the defense of qualified immunity. “Qualified immunity is an\naffirmative defense that shields government officials ‘from liability for civil damages insofar as their\nconduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\nperson would have known.’” Estate of Carter v. Detroit, 408 F.3d 305, 310–11 (6th Cir. 2005)\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                       Page 5\n\n\n(quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982)). The initial inquiry in ascertaining the\nvalidity of a qualified immunity defense is: “Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting\nthe injury, do the facts alleged show the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right?” Saucier\nv. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001). See also Silberstein v. Dayton, 440 F.3d 306, 311 (6th Cir. 2006).\n“In the course of determining whether a constitutional right was violated on the premises alleged,\na court might find it necessary to set forth principles which will become the basis for a holding that\na right is clearly established.” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 194. If the court can find, “on a favorable view\nof the [plaintiff’s] submissions,” a violation of a constitution right, the next step in Saucier’s\nsequential analysis is to determine if the right was clearly established. Ibid. See also Groh v.\nRamirez, 540 U.S. 551, 563–64 (2004) (noting that reasonable public officials should know the law\ngoverning their conduct). For a right to be clearly established, the “‘contours of the right must be\nsufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that\nright.’” Greene v. Barber, 310 F.3d 889, 893 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton, 483\nU.S. 635, 640 (1987)).\n         We will not grant immunity to a defendant if no reasonably competent peace officer would\nhave found probable cause. See Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986). In other words, “[i]t\nis clearly established that arrest without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment.” Klein v.\nLong, 275 F.3d 544, 550 (2001) (quoting Donovan v. Thames, 105 F.3d 291, 297–98 (6th Cir.\n1997)). Where the reasonableness of an officer’s actions hinge on disputed issues of fact, “the jury\nbecomes the final arbiter of . . . immunity, since the legal question of immunity is completely\ndependent upon which view of the facts is accepted by the jury.” Brandenburg v. Cureton, 882 F.2d\n211, 215–16 (6th Cir. 1989).\n        “[G]overnment officials in general, and police officers in particular, may not exercise their\nauthority for personal motives, particularly in response to real or perceived slights to their dignity.”\nBloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673, 682 (6th Cir. 1998) (quoting Duran v. Douglas, 904 F.2d 1372, 1378\n(9th Cir. 1990)). For a plaintiff to state a claim for First Amendment retaliation, he must show that\nthe injury was material, Bloch, 156 F.3d at 678 (that the injury would “would likely chill a person\nof ordinary firmness from continuing to engage in that activity”), “that his conduct was\nconstitutionally protected,” and that it was a “motivating factor” behind the government’s actions.\nAdair v. Charter County of Wayne, 452 F.3d 482, 492 (6th Cir. 2006); Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist.\nBd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977). A “motivating factor” is essentially but-for\ncause—“without which the action being challenged simply would not have been taken.” Greene,\n310 F.3d at 897.\n       Probable cause is clearly relevant to Leonard’s First Amendment retaliation claims. See\nHartman v. Moore, 126 S. Ct. 1695, 1699 (2006). In Hartman, the Supreme Court determined that\nprobable cause is an element of a malicious prosecution charge brought as constitutional tort under\nBivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). Hartman, 126 S. Ct. at\n1699. Although there are differences between wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution, see id.\nat 1705 (noting that “the causal connection required here is not merely between the retaliatory\nanimus of one person and that person’s own injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus of\none person and the action of another”), there is an obvious similarity in that “the significance of\nprobable cause or the lack of it looms large,” id. at 1706. Hartman, therefore, calls into question\nour cases holding that “probable cause is not determinative of the [First Amendment] constitutional\nquestion.” See Greene, 310 F.3d at 895. Yet, we need not decide whether Hartman adds another\nelement to every First Amendment claim brought pursuant to § 1983 because, when viewed in the\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, we find that the facts of this case demonstrate an absence of\nprobable cause.\n\fNo. 05-1728               Leonard v. Robinson                                                                  Page 6\n\n\n       In sum then, both Leonard’s claims1 and Robinson’s defenses turn on the laws that Leonard\nallegedly violated and their validity as applied in the context of a democratic assembly. Again,\nwhen the facts are viewed in a light most favorable to Leonard, we believe that First Amendment\nfreedoms, clearly established for a generation, preclude a finding of probable cause because the laws\ncited by Robinson are either facially invalid, vague, or overbroad when applied to speech (as\nopposed to conduct) at a democratic assembly where the speaker is not out of order.\n                                                          B\n       Robinson relies on four sections of Michigan’s Penal Code defining various misdemeanors.\nLeonard was charged with two violations of Michigan Law. The first is Michigan Compiled Laws\n§ 750.167, defining a disorderly person:\n         (1) A person is a disorderly person if the person is any of the following:\n                (a) A person of sufficient ability who refuses or neglects to support\n                his or her family. (b) A common prostitute. (c) A window peeper.\n                (d) A person who engages in an illegal occupation or business. (e) A\n                person who is intoxicated in a public place and who is either\n                endangering directly the safety of another person or of property or is\n                acting in a manner that causes a public disturbance. (f) A person who\n                is engaged in indecent or obscene conduct in a public place. (g) A\n                vagrant. (h) A person found begging in a public place. (i) A person\n                found loitering in a house of ill fame or prostitution or place where\n                prostitution or lewdness is practiced, encouraged, or allowed.\n                                                 ***\nIbid. (emphasis added). See also Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.168 (stating that it is a misdemeanor to\nbe a disorderly person). In Robinson’s deposition, he reveals that he believes subsection (f) to be\nmost applicable to Leonard’s conduct at the meeting. The criminal citation also relied upon\nMichigan Compiled Laws § 750.337:\n         INDECENT, ETC., LANGUAGE IN PRESENCE OF WOMEN OR\n         CHILDREN—Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or\n         insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty\n         of a misdemeanor.\nIbid., invalidated by People v. Boomer, 655 N.W.2d 255 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002).\n        Additionally, to support his defenses of qualified immunity and probable cause, Robinson\npresented two more statutes in his motion for summary judgment. See Br. of Appellee at 10–12.\nThe first of these, Michigan Compiled Laws § 750.103 states:\n         CURSING AND SWEARING—Any person who has arrived at the age of discretion,\n         who shall profanely curse or damn or swear by the name of God, Jesus Christ or the\n         Holy Ghost, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. No such prosecution shall be sustained\n         unless it shall be commenced within 5 days after the commission of such offense.\nIbid. The next and last law, Michigan Compiled Laws § 750.170, states:\n\n\n         1\n            “To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must set forth facts that, when construed favorably,\nestablish (1) the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States (2) caused by a person\nacting under the color of state law.” Sigley v. City of Parma Heights, 437 F.3d 527, 533 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v.

It specifically\nallows for the people “to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” U.S. Const. amend.\nI. The limitations of the First Amendment are applicable to the states. See Near v. Minnesota, 283\nU.S. 697, 707 (1931) (“It is no longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press and of speech is\nwithin the liberty safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from\ninvasion by state action.”).\n                 Whatever differences may exist about interpretations of the First Amendment,\n        there is practically universal agreement that a major purpose of that Amendment was\n        to protect the free discussion of governmental affairs. This of course includes\n        discussions of candidates, structures and forms of government, the manner in which\n        government is operated or should be operated, and all such matters relating to\n        political processes.\nMills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218–19 (1966); Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369 (1931)\n(“The maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may\nbe responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means, an\nopportunity essential to the security of the Republic, is a fundamental principle of our constitutional\nsystem”). The First Amendment reflects “a profound national commitment to the principle that\ndebate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include\nvehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”\nN.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964) (citing Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1\n(1949) and De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937)). Even those who advocate the most narrow\ninterpretation of the freedom of speech agree that in a democratic forum like a township meeting,\nthe state should abstain from regulating speech:\n        Constitutional protection should be accorded only to speech that is explictily [sic]\n        political. There is no basis for judicial intervention to protect any other form of\n        expression, be it scientific, literary or that variety of expression we call obscene or\n        pornographic. Moreover, within that category of speech we ordinarily call political,\n        there should be no constitutional obstruction to laws making criminal any speech that\n        advocates forcible overthrow of the government or the violation of any law.\nRobert H. Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L.J. 1, 20 (1971).\n        Of course, the constitutional protection of speech is not without limits. Specifically not\nafforded protection are fighting words, “those words which by their very utterance inflict injury or\ntend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.” Barnes v. Wright, 449 F.3d 709, 717 (6th Cir.\n2006) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n        The First Amendment permits “restrictions upon the content of speech in a few\n        limited areas, which are ‘of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit\n        that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order\n        and morality.’”\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                         Page 8\n\n\n              Thus, for example . . . fighting words—“those personally abusive epithets\n       which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common\n       knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction”—are generally\n       proscribable under the First Amendment.\nVirginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 358–59 (2003) (citations omitted) (holding that the First\nAmendment permits Virginia to outlaw cross burnings done with the intent to intimidate because\nburning a cross is a particularly virulent form of intimidation and speech or symbolic acts to\nintimidate lack First Amendment protection).\n                                                  D\n        Section 750.337 of Michigan Compiled Laws, regulating speech in the presence of women\nor children, was held unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals of Michigan in Boomer, 655 N.W.2d\n255. Boomer reversed the conviction of a criminal defendant prosecuted under the law. The man,\nknown to the local media as the cussing canoeist, was convicted for uttering a string of expletives\nin the presence of women and children upon tipping his canoe on the Rifle River. Id. at 256. See\nalso Sarah Kershaw, A 1909 Washington State Law Shielding a Woman’s Virtue Is Being\nChallenged, N.Y. Times, Jan. 26, 2005 at A13. The court determined that it was “unnecessary to\naddress [Boomer’s] overbreadth arguments, or to undertake an extensive First Amendment analysis,\nbecause . . . M.C.L. § 750.337 is unconstitutionally vague.” 655 N.W.2d at 257. The court\nexplained that “in order to pass constitutional muster, a penal statute must define the criminal\noffense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\nand in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Id. at 258\n(internal quotations and citations omitted).\n       A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and\n       juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of\n       arbitrary and discriminatory application. . . . Uncertain meanings inevitably lead\n       citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden\n       areas were clearly marked.\n               Here, it would be difficult to conceive of a statute that would be more vague\n       than M.C.L. § 750.337. There is no restrictive language whatsoever contained in the\n       statute that would limit or guide a prosecution for indecent, immoral, obscene,\n       vulgar, or insulting language. Allowing a prosecution where one utters “insulting”\n       language could possibly subject a vast percentage of the populace to a misdemeanor\n       conviction.\nId. at 258–59 (emphasis added) (citations, internal quotations, and omissions removed).\n        The court went on to state that, “[the statute], as currently drafted, impinges on First\nAmendment freedoms. . . . [It is] unquestionable that [the statute], as drafted, reaches\nconstitutionally protected speech, and it operates to inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights.”\nId. at 259. Thus, it is clear that probable cause for Leonard’s arrest is not supported by § 750.337.\nSee Sandul v. Larion, 119 F.3d 1250, 1256 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that protected speech cannot\nserve as the basis for a violation of city ordinances at issue).\n        Michigan’s courts have not commented so clearly and directly upon the constitutionality of\nthe other three statutes at issue in this case. Surely aware of this fact, Robinson argues that Boomer\nsays nothing about the other statutes’ validity because it is well established that:\n              Police are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared\n       unconstitutional. The enactment of a law forecloses speculation by enforcement\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                       Page 9\n\n\n       officers concerning its constitutionality-with the possible exception of a law so\n       grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would\n       be bound to see its flaws. Society would be ill-served if its police officers took it\n       upon themselves to determine which laws are and which are not constitutionally\n       entitled to enforcement.\nDeFillippo, 443 U.S. at 38 (emphasis added); accord Boomer, 655 N.W.2d at 257. The Michigan\nSupreme Court held that the law in Boomer was just such a law—that it was “difficult to conceive\nof a statute that would be more vague than M.C.L. § 750.337.” 655 N.W.2d at 258. See also\nSandul, 119 F.3d at 1257 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (arguing that DeFillippo is strengthened in “the\nabsence of any Michigan case law which has held a similar ordinance unconstitutional.”). Similarly,\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, no reasonable police officer would\nbelieve that any of the three other Michigan statutes relied upon by the district court are\nconstitutional as applied to Leonard’s political speech during a democratic assembly.\n         Therefore, and for many of the same reasons relied upon by the Boomer court, we hold that\nMichigan Compiled Laws § 750.167(f), to the extent it is applied to Leonard’s speech, cannot here\nsupport probable cause. First, the plain language of that statute regulates conduct and not speech.\nWe understand indecent or obscene as regulated in § 750.167(f) as regulating “conduct consisting\nof exposing private body parts when one reasonably might expect that they would be viewed\nunwantedly by others,” United States v. Whitmore, 314 F. Supp. 2d 690, 698 (E.D. Mich. 2004),\nand not speech. Furthermore, to the extent that § 750.167(f) is intended to regulate speech, we hold\nthat its language is so free of limitation and so closely tracks that of § 750.337 that it is flagrantly\nunconstitutional.\n        Next, we hold that Leonard’s conduct could not have been proscribed by Michigan Compiled\nLaws § 750.103. That law makes “profanely curs[ing] or damn[ing] or swear[ing] by the name of\nGod, Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost” a crime. Ibid. The Supreme Court has held that a state may\nnot make a “single four-letter expletive a criminal offense.” Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 26\n(1971). In Cohen, “the defendant was observed in the Los Angeles County Courthouse . . . wearing\na jacket bearing the words ‘Fuck the Draft.’” Id. at 16. “The defendant [in Cohen] testified that he\nwore the jacket knowing that the words were on the jacket as a means of informing the public of the\ndepth of his feelings against the Vietnam War and the draft.” Ibid. We can find no principled\ndistinction between the expletive in Cohen and the milder profanity in this case. Although “the right\nof free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances,” Chaplinsky v. New\nHampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571 (1942), Leonard’s utterance of “God damn,” was not, as a matter of\nlaw “likely to cause a fight.” Id. at 573. Accord Sandidge v. State, 630 S.E.2d 585, 586 (Ga. Ct.\nApp. 2006) (holding that “arrest me” and “damn” were not fighting words and listing other Georgia\ncases that did involve fighting words under Chaplinsky); Sandul, 119 F.3d at 1255 (citing\nChaplinsky, and relying on Cohen for the holding that the use of the word “fuck,” in and of itself,\nis not criminal conduct). Prohibiting Leonard from coupling an expletive to his political speech is\nclearly unconstitutional. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1973) (conduct may be obscene\nwhen, taken as a whole, it lacks serious political value). Section 750.103, if not facially invalid, is\nradically limited by the First Amendment.\n       Finally, we consider Michigan Compiled Laws. § 750.170, prohibiting “[a]ny person who\nshall make or excite any disturbance or contention . . . at any . . . public meeting where citizens are\npeaceably and lawfully assembled.” Although this section may constitutionally proscribe some\nconduct, it has already been held to be overbroad by a Michigan court. We agree.\n        A sit-in at the University of Michigan’s Literature, Science, and Arts building was the\nsubject of People v. Mash, 206 N.W.2d 767, 768 (Mich. Ct. App. 1973). The defendant in that case\nchallenged that § 750.170 was void for vagueness and overbreadth. Ibid. The Mash court\n\fNo. 05-1728            Leonard v. Robinson                                                          Page 10\n\n\nrecognized that the words “excite any contention” must be excised from the statute for it to survive\nconstitutional scrutiny, for without this alteration, the statute might unconstitutionally criminalize\nthe expression of ideas, “‘merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their\nhearers.’” See Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.S. 564, 571 (1970) (quoting Street v. New York, 394\nU.S. 576, 592 (1969)). An earlier decision by the Court of Appeals of Michigan had suggested:\n        In all prosecutions under this statute the activity to be punished must be shown to\n        present clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or a threat\n        to public safety. The statute is concerned with intentional acts of violence or threats\n        of the commission of acts of violence by persons having the ability of immediate\n        execution of such threats.\nPeople v. Purifoy, 191 N.W.2d 63, 64 (Mich. Ct. App. 1971). The Mash court refused to adopt these\nlimiting principles. While Mash is somewhat unclear about what expressive conduct may be\nproscribed by the state, when we view the facts here in a light most favorable to Leonard, there is\nno conduct at issue for the statute to prohibit, nor is there conduct upon which Robinson could find\nprobable cause.\n          Application of Mash to these facts is, in the first instance, a job for the district court. For our\npurposes, we consider Leonard’s version of the incident and “view the facts and any inferences\nreasonably drawn from them in the light most favorable to [him.]” Kalamazoo Acquisitions, 395\nF.3d at 342. On this view, there was no disturbance to which a court might apply § 750.170 and no\nreasonable police officer could think so. The exact nature of Leonard’s conduct is instead a disputed\nissue of material fact, and our legal analysis need not consider the merits of that dispute. See\nCureton, 882 F.2d at 215–16. On one view of the facts, Leonard was merely advocating an idea.\nThis cannot support a conviction and it cannot create probable cause. Bachellar, 397 U.S. at 570.\n“It is firmly settled that under our Constitution the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited\nmerely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.” Street, 394 U.S. at 592;\nPolice Dep’t of City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96 (1972) (noting “an ‘equality of status in\nthe field of ideas’”). See also, e.g., Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131, 150 (1966) (reversing a\nbreach of the peace conviction for staging a protest at a segregated library); Shuttlesworth v. City\nof Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87 (1965) (reversing a loitering conviction in connection with a civil rights\nprotest); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229 (1963) (reversing breach of the peace convictions\nfor protest against segregation on the capitol grounds). But see Feiner v. New York, 340 U.S. 315,\n320 (1951) (upholding conviction for breach of the peace where sidewalk speaker created an\n“immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order.”)\n         The crux of this case perhaps lies in the dissent’s statement that certain facts are “undisputed\nbecause the record contains a video of the incident.” The dissent’s characterization of the events\nshown on the tape, as rendered at page 14, is perhaps reasonable. However, that characterization\nis neither undisputed, nor undisputable. This judge has looked at the same tape, and not only come\nto a slightly different conclusion personally, but more importantly concluded that a rational juror\ncould come to a different conclusion. This judgment means that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether Leonard’s conduct could constitutionally be considered criminal by any rational\nofficer.\n        We conclude that the statute is unconstitutional as applied by the district court because the\nprocedural posture of the case permits a finding that Leonard merely advocated an idea. This\nconclusion is based upon First Amendment jurisprudence that is decades old. In light of this, and\nof the prominent position that free political speech has in our jurisprudence and in our society, it\ncannot be seriously contended that any reasonable peace officer, or citizen, for that matter, would\nbelieve that mild profanity while peacefully advocating a political position could constitute a\ncriminal act. The facts in this case could lead a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                     Page 11\n\n\ncircumstance of Leonard’s arrest for disturbing the peace were devoid of any indicia of disruption\nor contention. See Mich. Comp. Laws. § 750.170.\n        We therefore hold that no reasonable officer would find that probable cause exists to arrest\na recognized speaker at a chaired public assembly based solely on the content of his speech (albeit\nvigorous or blasphemous) unless and until the speaker is determined to be out of order by the\nindividual chairing the assembly. See Jones v. Heyman, 888 F.2d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir. 1989)\n(holding that the chair of city commission meeting may, without violating the First Amendment,\nhave a speaker removed when she becomes disorderly by speaking off-topic). Any peace officer\nin attendance can reasonably be expected to restrain herself from arresting speakers based upon what\nthey say while advocating their political positions in an orderly fashion. See Houston v. Hill, 482\nU.S. 451, 461–62 (1987) (noting that a properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to\nexercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen). Therefore, because Leonard’s arrest\nwas not supported by probable cause, it was error for the district court to grant Robinson qualified\nimmunity on the Fourth Amendment claims.\n                                                  E\n         The district court’s analysis of the retaliation claim under Mt. Healthy was also flawed.\nBecause Leonard’s conduct was constitutionally protected and because arrest is particularly suited\nto chill this conduct, see Bloch, 156 F.3d at 679–80 (holding that a combination of embarrassment,\nhumiliation, and emotional distress is sufficient to chill for Mt. Healthy’s purposes), we focus on the\ndistrict court’s evaluation of Robinson’s motive for the arrest. The district court never considered\nwhether Leonard’s exchange with the board was protected speech. It accepted without analysis that\nthe Michigan statutes were valid as applied because no court decision had specifically struck them\ndown in toto. The court then concluded that Michigan had validly proscribed Leonard’s conduct\nbefore the Board and that probable cause existed for an arrest.\n      The district court did not address evidence that was relevant to Robinson’s motivation in\nmaking the arrest. The court noted, that at the moment of arrest:\n       Plaintiff already had commenced his vehement complaints that the township board\n       had been “screwing over” his family’s business, and he already had made the\n       reference to a “goddamn lawsuit” which, as discussed earlier, provided probable\n       cause to arrest for violating Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.103. Moreover, all of these\n       statements were directed at the township supervisor, and not at Defendant.\n       Consequently, when Defendant initially approached Plaintiff and asked him to calm\n       down, there would have been absolutely no reason to suspect that Defendant’s “true\n       motivation was to punish a slight to his dignity.” Rather, Defendant presumably\n       could only have been acting out of an appropriate desire to preserve calm and order\n       at a public meeting, or perhaps with the intention to act upon Plaintiff’s apparent\n       violation of a Michigan statute. At a minimum, there is absolutely no evidence of\n       any improper motive or purpose that might have led Defendant to initiate the\n       encounter with Plaintiff.\nD. Ct. Op. at 21–22 (emphasis added).\n        Although we believe that it is a close case on this point, we reverse. A reasonable factfinder,\nviewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to Leonard, could conclude that he was\narrested in retaliation for constitutionally protected conduct. Leonard’s deposition reveals disputed\nfacts about a prior lawsuit (several lawsuits, according to counsel at oral argument), a feud between\nthe police department and his family, and Chief Abraham’s “hatred” of his wife. The recording of\nthe Township meeting, with Leonard off-camera and recorded only in voice, also creates a triable\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v.

In response to the\nquestion, “Do you have any—aside from your opinion that’s happened, do you have any facts or any\nstatements from people to support your opinion [that Robinson was ordered to arrest one of the\nLeonards]?” Leonard answered, “No.” This answer is inconsistent with Leonard’s prior statements\nin the same deposition where he details the circumstances surrounding his wife’s prior lawsuit with\nChief Abraham. In light of this, his answer can be interpreted as a response to a misunderstood\nquestion because it is not unreasonable to infer that the related facts about the political situation in\nMontrose support Leonard’s opinion. We interpret Leonard’s “no” answer to mean that he was\nunaware of any direct admissions from the defendant or Chief Abraham that would definitively\nprove his case. It is not Leonard’s burden to depose every individual whose testimony might add\ncredibility to his allegations in order to oppose Robinson’s motion for summary judgment. These\nare difficult cases to try, see Hartman, 126 S. Ct. at 1705, but the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding Leonard’s arrest are sufficiently odious to support a reasonable inference of retaliatory\nconduct. Robinson could have eliminated these suspicions by deposing Leonard’s wife and mother-\nin-law, whose testimony would tend to either enhance or detract from the veracity of Leonard’s\nallegations. In fact, Leonard’s final witness list prepared for the district court names Sarah Leonard,\nand his mother-in-law, Agnes Johnson, as individuals who may testify for the plaintiff.\n         We hold that Leonard has set out a prima facie case of First Amendment retaliation and has\ncreated a genuine issue of material fact. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A jury could reasonably find that\nRobinson acted out of malice in arresting Leonard. See Musso v. Hourigan, 836 F.2d 736, 742 (2d\nCir. 1988) (affirming the district court’s denial of qualified immunity on First Amendment\nretaliation allegations of false arrest at an open school board meeting).\n                                                  IV\n      For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the district court’s entry of summary judgment\nand REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                      Page 13\n\n\n                    _______________________________________________\n                     CONCURRING IN PART, DISSENTING IN PART\n                    _______________________________________________\n        SUTTON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Officer Robinson had\nprobable cause to arrest Leonard for violating any one of four Michigan statutes: Michigan\nCompiled Laws § 750.103 (“Cursing and swearing”); § 750.167 (“Disorderly person”); § 750.170\n(“Disturbance of lawful meetings”); and § 750.337 (“Women or children, improper language in\npresence”). While I am prepared to accept the majority’s judgment that the application of all four\nstatutes to Leonard violated his First Amendment rights, I am not prepared to accept its judgment\nthat the Supreme Court, our court or the Michigan courts had clearly established the\nunconstitutionality of all four of these duly enacted laws before this incident.\n        The Michigan courts, it is true, had declared one of the four statutes facially unconstitutional\nsix-and-a-half months before this arrest. See Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.337 (criminalizing the “use\n[of] any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or insulting language in the presence or hearing of any\nwoman or child”), invalidated by People v. Boomer, 655 N.W.2d 255, 259 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002)\n(holding § 750.337 “facially vague”). But the other three have been on the books since 1931, see\nMich. Pub. Act No. 328, §§ 103, 167, 170 (Sept. 18, 1931), were enacted by a state legislature sworn\nto uphold the United States Constitution, see U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 3, and accordingly receive a\npresumption of constitutionality, Illinois v. Krull, 480 U.S. 340, 351 (1987).\n        Put yourself in the shoes of Officer Robinson when it comes to enforcing just one of these\nstatutes, § 750.170 (“Disturbance of lawful meetings”), on the evening of October 15, 2002. Let us\nassume (improbably) that Robinson had looked at the statute before attending the meeting. Let us\nassume (even more improbably) that Robinson had looked at judicial interpretations of the statute\nbefore the meeting. And let us assume (most improbably) that Robinson had read Cohen v.\nCalifornia, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), before the meeting.\n        The statute, he would have learned, says that “[a]ny person who shall make or excite any\ndisturbance . . . at any election or other public meeting where citizens are peaceably and lawfully\nassembled, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Nothing about the case law enforcing the provision\nwould have tipped him off that he was clearly forbidden from applying it here. One of the cases\ndefines “disturbance” as “[a]ny act . . . contrary to the usages of a sort of meeting and class of\npersons assembled that interferes with its due progress or irritates the assembly in whole or in part.”\nPeople v. Weinberg, 149 N.W.2d 248, 251 (Mich. Ct. App. 1967) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nid. at 252–53 (upholding a conviction under the law on the grounds that the defendants “hindered\nand interfered” with a savings and loan association’s “right to conduct [its] business in an orderly,\nquiet, decorous manner” when they sat on the floor and were “requested to leave” but “refused to\ndo so”). Another case upholds a conviction where the evidence showed that the defendants had\n“failed to leave the building when requested” and that their presence interfered with janitorial\nservice. People v. Mash, 206 N.W.2d 767, 770 (Mich. Ct. App. 1973). And both of these cases\nuphold the statute in the face of constitutional challenges. Mash, 206 N.W.2d at 770 (holding that\n“§ 750.170 is not void for vagueness nor constitutionally infirm for overbreadth”); Weinberg, 149\nN.W.2d at 255–56 (holding that § 750.170 was not “unconstitutionally broad” and upholding\nconvictions in the face of a First Amendment challenge). As for Cohen v. California, it would have\ntaught him that the First (and Fourteenth) Amendment prohibits a State from making “a single four-\nletter expletive a criminal offense.” 403 U.S. at 26.\n        All Robinson would have learned, in other words, is that the statute had been enforced\nseveral times during its 75-year existence; it had not sunk into desuetude as shown by the fact that\nit had been enforced within the last decade, People v. Walker, No. 198893, 1998 WL 1989516\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                     Page 14\n\n\n(Mich. Ct. App. Oct. 27, 1998); it had withstood two constitutional challenges, one of them on First\nAmendment grounds; and Cohen prevented him only from arresting someone on the sole ground that\nthe individual had uttered an expletive. Even had Robinson been equipped with this uncommonly\nextensive knowledge of Michigan and federal law, indeed even had Robinson carried a laptop\nequipped with Westlaw and Lexis/Nexis to the meeting, I am hard pressed to understand how he\nwould have known that it was “clearly established” that he could not enforce this law in this setting.\n         The undisputed facts (undisputed because the record contains a video of the incident) show\nthat Robinson observed Leonard at a “public meeting where citizens were peaceably and lawfully\nassembled,” Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.170, yelling, swearing and answering requests with the words\n“I’ll do what I want.” JA 152. What starts as a pointed, but seemingly controlled, exchange\nbetween Leonard and a board member turns into Leonard speaking over the board member and\ndegenerates into Leonard losing control and simply yelling at the board member. At that stage,\nwhen Robinson stepped in, Leonard not only had created a “disturbance” at this public meeting but\nalso had lost control of himself. One can only wonder where the verbal confrontation was heading,\nand it is doubtful that a single one of the 25 or so people in attendance (save the Leonards) regretted\nRobinson’s decision to take action. A reasonable police officer could fairly believe that Leonard\nhad “excite[d] [a] disturbance,” Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.170, either by “interfer[ing]” with the\ncouncil meeting’s “due progress” by “refusing” to abide by the council member’s requests,\nWeinberg, 149 N.W.2d at 251; see also Mash, 206 N.W.2d at 770, or by “hinder[ing]” the meeting\nfrom “conduct[ing] [its] business” by yelling and cursing during the meeting, Weinberg, 149 N.W.2d\nat 252.\n        It may be true that Robinson did not wait for the chair to call Leonard “out of order.” See\nMaj. Op. at 11. But I am not aware of any requirement—under Michigan law, the First Amendment\nor any other law—that an officer may restore order to such a gathering only by following Robert’s\nRules of Order.\n        Nor does People v. Purifoy, 191 N.W.2d 63 (Mich. Ct. App. 1971), alter this conclusion.\nWhile one of the three judges reviewing that case stated that activity punished under § 750.170 must\npresent a “clear and present danger of riot,” id. at 65, two of the three judges in Purifoy expressly\nrejected this language, id. (Danhof and V.F. Brennan, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(“We cannot agree, however, that all prosecutions under the statute . . . would require that the\nactivity to be punished must be shown to present a clear and present danger of riot . . . .”). Two\nyears later, Mash removed all doubt about the point. See 206 N.W.2d at 770 (noting that “the other\nmembers of the [Purifoy] panel . . . . declined to adopt the qualifying language cited by the Chief\nJudge,” and holding that “[w]e also respectfully decline to follow this dicta in Purifoy”).\n        In Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31 (1979), the Supreme Court addressed the problem\nraised by this case—namely, how can the courts fairly require police officers to anticipate\nconstitutional rulings?—in the context of ruling on a suppression motion filed under the Fourth\nAmendment:\n       At that time, of course, there was no controlling precedent that this ordinance was\n       or was not constitutional, and hence the conduct observed violated a presumptively\n       valid ordinance. A prudent officer, in the course of determining whether respondent\n       had committed an offense under all the circumstances shown by this record, should\n       not have been required to anticipate that a court would later hold the ordinance\n       unconstitutional.\n               Police are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared\n       unconstitutional. The enactment of a law forecloses speculation by enforcement\n       officers concerning its constitutionality—with the possible exception of a law so\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                      Page 15\n\n\n       grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would\n       be bound to see its flaws. Society would be ill-served if its police officers took it\n       upon themselves to determine which laws are and which are not constitutionally\n       entitled to enforcement.\nId. at 37–38. Similar reasoning ought to apply here. DeFillippo, it is true, applied what came to be\nknown as the “Leon good faith” exception to the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 38. But “the Leon\ngood-faith inquiry and the qualified-immunity inquiry are one and the ‘same,’” Baranski v. Fifteen\nUnknown Agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 452 F.3d 433, 448 (6th Cir. 2006)\n(en banc) (quoting Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 565 n.8 (2004)); see also United States v. Leon,\n468 U.S. 897, 911–12 (1984) (“We have not required suppression of the fruits of a search incident\nto an arrest made in good-faith reliance on a substantive criminal statute that subsequently is\ndeclared unconstitutional.”) (citing DeFillippo).\n         To my knowledge, the Supreme Court has never rejected a claim of qualified immunity to\na police officer who enforced a statute that had not been declared unconstitutional at the time of the\ncitizen-police encounter. While DeFillippo acknowledges “the possible exception of a law so\ngrossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to\nsee its flaws,” 443 U.S. at 38, the exception remains just that—a theoretical possibility, one that can\nbe imagined but that the Court has never enforced.\n        Adhering to DeFillippo’s guidance that the combination of legislative action and judicial\ninaction generally “forecloses speculation by enforcement officers concerning [a statute’s]\nconstitutionality,” 443 U.S. at 38, the Sixth Circuit has resisted imposing liability on police officers\nand other officials who fail to anticipate each twist and turn of judicial review. See Risbridger v.\nConnelly, 275 F.3d 565, 574 (6th Cir. 2002) (granting qualified immunity to an officer who had\narrested plaintiff for refusing to identify himself because “a reasonable officer would not have\nknown that the ordinance would be found to be unconstitutionally vague as applied in this\nsituation”); Wolfel v. Morris, 972 F.2d 712, 720 (6th Cir. 1992) (“[S]ince the defendants reasonably\nrelied on and applied valid regulations, they are entitled to qualified immunity for their actions. The\nfact that these regulations were subsequently held unconstitutionally vague as applied in a court case\naddressing a fairly complex legal matter cannot serve to strip these individuals of their\nimmunity . . . .”); Hanna v. Drobnick, 514 F.2d 393, 397 (6th Cir. 1975) (“[The building inspectors’]\nactions at the time were presumptively valid under a city ordinance which they had no part in\nadopting and which had not been declared unconstitutional. . . . [W]e perceive no duty on the part\nof the building inspectors to defy their city’s ordinance and their supervisors’ instructions by\nasserting the invalidity of the penalty clause of the ordinance which had not yet been attacked.”),\nrepudiated on other grounds by Thomas v. Shipka, 818 F.2d 496 (6th Cir. 1987); see also Prose v.\nWendover, 96 F. App’x 358, 364 (6th Cir. April 27, 2004) (“Because the only court to have\nconsidered the ordinance in question, a federal district court, concluded that it was not ‘patently and\nflagrantly unconstitutional,’ the officers were entitled to qualified immunity from a claim that they\nviolated the First Amendment by attempting to enforce it.”).\n        The other courts of appeals have taken the same path. See Vives v. City of New York, 405\nF.3d 115, 117–18 (2d Cir. 2005) (granting qualified immunity to officers because no case\nestablished “the proposition that [the statute] is facially unconstitutional”); Cooper v. Dillon, 403\nF.3d 1208, 1220 (11th Cir. 2005) (granting qualified immunity to officers because “[a]t the time of\nCooper’s arrest, the statute had not been declared unconstitutional, and therefore it could not have\nbeen apparent to Dillon that he was violating Cooper’s constitutional rights”); Blumenthal v. Crotty,\n346 F.3d 84, 104–05 (2d Cir. 2003) (granting qualified immunity to state officials because\n“enforcement of a presumptively valid statute creates a heavy presumption in favor of qualified\nimmunity”); Doe v. Heck, 327 F.3d 492, 516 (7th Cir. 2003) (granting qualified immunity to state\nofficials who enforced corporal-punishment statute later declared unconstitutional because they had\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                       Page 16\n\n\nacted within their “statutory authority”); Lederman v. United States, 291 F.3d 36, 45, 47 (D.C. Cir.\n2002) (granting qualified immunity to officers who arrested plaintiff for distributing leaflets in a\n“no-demonstration zone” on the Capitol Grounds because while the law contained “profound flaws”\nand was “astonishing[ly]” broad it was not “so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that the\nofficers should have recognized its flaws”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Grossman v. City of\nPortland, 33 F.3d 1200, 1210 (9th Cir. 1994) (granting qualified immunity to officer who arrested\nplaintiff for demonstrating without a permit because “an officer who reasonably relies on the\nlegislature’s determination that a statute is constitutional [and arrests with probable cause] should\nbe shielded from personal liability”); Swanson v. Powers, 937 F.2d 965, 968–69 (4th Cir. 1991)\n(granting qualified immunity to state revenue secretary who enforced a tax later declared\nunconstitutional because she “was enforcing a long-standing statute” that is presumptively\nconstitutional).\n        The only case of which I am aware construing DeFillippo and denying qualified immunity\nis Carey v. Nevada Gaming Control Board, 279 F.3d 873 (9th Cir. 2002). But in that case “two\nNinth Circuit cases [were] directly on point” because they had declared parallel statutes of other\nStates—permitting an arrest for refusing to identify oneself—unconstitutional. Id. at 881. That of\ncourse does not remotely describe today’s case. Nor does Sandul v. Larion, 119 F.3d 1250 (6th Cir.\n1997), offer any refuge to Leonard. It dealt not with the question whether an officer could be denied\nqualified immunity for failing to predict a judicial ruling declaring a statute unconstitutional but with\nwhether the statute covered the plaintiff’s conduct. See id. at 1256 (holding that shouting epithets\nfrom a moving car did not provide probable cause to arrest the plaintiff under a disorderly-conduct\nstatute).\n        In the end, Leonard not only asks us to take a road less traveled but one never traveled. It\nis one thing to credit police officers with knowledge of all statutory and constitutional rulings\npotentially bearing on all statutes they enforce; but this necessary requirement needlessly loses any\nconnection with reality when we hold police officers to the standard of anticipating a court’s later\ninvalidation of a statute that was duly enacted by legislators sworn to uphold the Constitution, that\nis presumed constitutional, that has been on the books for 75 years and that has withstood two\nconstitutional challenges. The First Amendment properly protected Leonard from being prosecuted\nfor his unruly speech and conduct—and for now that is enough. To expose Robinson to money\ndamages for enforcing these laws not only seems unfair (absolute immunity protects the legislature\nfrom similar risks, Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44, 48–49 (1998)) but also risks placing him in\nthe push-me-pull-me predicament of having to decide which duly enacted laws to enforce and which\nones not to enforce on the pain of losing either way—because he is charged with dereliction of duty\nwhen he opts not to enforce the law and because he is charged with money damages when he does\nenforce the law. See Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 555 (1967) (“A policeman’s lot is not so\nunhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest\nwhen he has probable cause, and being mulcted in damages if he does.”).\n        Leonard fares no better under his free-speech retaliation claim. Because probable cause\nexisted to arrest Leonard, as has been shown, our case law forecloses this claim as a matter of law.\nSee Barnes v. Wright, 449 F.3d 709, 720 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he defendants had probable cause to\nseek an indictment and to arrest Barnes on each of the criminal charges in this case. Barnes’s First\nAmendment retaliation claim accordingly fails as a matter of law . . . .”).\n       But even had probable cause been missing, this claim still would fail as a matter of law. No\nevidence shows that Robinson was doing anything but attempting to restore calm to the disrupted\nboard meeting. Robinson gave no indication of a retaliatory motive. Cf. Greene v. Barber, 310 F.3d\n889, 892 (6th Cir. 2002) (“‘I said, “This is the United States of America and we have freedom of\nspeech here” . . . . [The police officer] answered, “Well, not in my building” . . . .’”) (bracket\nomitted); Adair v. Charter County of Wayne, 452 F.3d 482, 492 (6th Cir. 2006) (noting that the\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                    Page 17\n\n\ncritical issue is “whether the adverse action was motivated at least in part as a response to the\nexercise of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights”). None of Leonard’s speech was directed at\nRobinson. And no evidence shows that Robinson had any stake in the dispute between the city and\nthe Leonards. Prior lawsuits between the city and the Leonards, a feud between the police\ndepartment and the Leonards and Chief Abraham’s apparent “hatred” of Leonard’s wife thus do not\nbear on whether Robinson had a retaliatory motive.\n         The fainthearted suggestion that Chief Abraham had sent Robinson on a retaliatory errand\nis just that—if not less than that. “I think,” Leonard initially proposes in his deposition testimony,\nthat Robinson “was probably sent there by the chief.” JA 151. But Leonard then acknowledges that\n“aside from [his] opinion,” he did not “have any facts or any statements from people to support [that]\nopinion.” Id. The undisputed evidence reveals that Robinson was asked to “swing through” the\nmeeting for 15 to 20 minutes, that Chief Abraham never said “anything negative to [Robinson] about\nthe Leonards” and that no board member had any conversation with Robinson about Mr. Leonard.\nJA 138. The majority seeing these issues differently, I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

Thomas Leonard appeals the judgment of the district court granting\nsummary judgment to the defendant, Stephen Robinson, in this civil rights action resulting from\nLeonard’s arrest at a township board meeting. The district court dismissed the case, holding that\nRobinson was entitled to qualified immunity on claims for wrongful arrest and that Leonard could\nnot make out a prima facie case on his claim for First Amendment retaliation in violation of his civil\nrights. We reverse both holdings. The district court’s application of state law to Leonard’s conduct\noverlooked the First Amendment and its evaluation of Leonard’s retaliation claim ignored evidence\nindicating that Robinson did have an improper motive. We hold that 1) no reasonable officer would\nhave found probable cause to arrest Leonard solely for uttering “God damn” while addressing the\ntownship board because the First Amendment protects this sort of uninhibited debate, and\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                      Page 2\n\n\n2) Leonard’s retaliation claim survives summary judgment because Robinson’s motive for the arrest\nis a genuine issue of material fact in dispute.\n                                                  I\n        This case presents the question of whether an arrest for obscenity, vulgarity, or disturbing\nthe peace, when based upon speech and not conduct, is valid when it occurs during a democratic\nassembly where there is no evidence that the individual arrested was out of order and some evidence\nof improper motive by the arresting officer. With due regard to the procedural disposition of the\ncase, the facts are here recounted in the light most favorable to Leonard.\n        Leonard’s wife Sarah operates a towing company called Leonard’s Auto Works. Auto\nWorks was the exclusive towing company for the township of Montrose, Michigan until around\n2000. At that time, the Montrose Township Chief of Police, Charles Abraham, was promoting his\nown plan with the city board to extend township police jurisdiction to include the city of Montrose\nas well as the surrounding township. Agnes Johnson, Sarah Leonard’s mother, was a member of the\nCity Council and opposed Abraham’s plan. Abraham asked Sarah to lobby her mother in support\nof the plan. In return, he offered, Auto Works could continue to tow for the Township. When Sarah\nrefused, Auto Works lost its business with the Township. Sarah sued the Township and Chief\nAbraham in Genesee County Circuit Court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violating her First\nAmendment rights. The case was removed to federal court and settled in February 2003. Leonard\nv. Montrose, No. 02-71084 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 11, 2003) (stipulation dismissing case). As a result of\nthe lawsuit, according to Leonard, Chief Abraham hated him and his wife.\n        Before the settlement, on October 15, 2002, Thomas, Sarah, and their child attended a\nTownship Board meeting. Officer Robinson testified that he was ordered by Chief Abraham to\nattend the meeting. Thomas Leonard believes that Abraham ordered Robinson to attend so that he\nmight arrest Sarah in retaliation for her suit against him. Much of the meeting was recorded on\nvideotape. When he arrived, Robinson took his seat at the back of the meeting hall because he\n“do[esn’t] really like anyone behind [him].” Near the beginning of the meeting, Robinson was asked\nby another attendee why he, a police officer, was present. Robinson lied in response—he did not\ndisclose that the Chief had ordered him to attend. Instead, he said, “I’d like to see what’s going on.”\n        Later in the meeting, during the portion known as Citizen Time, Sarah addressed the council\nabout the actions the Township had taken that had affected her business: Auto Works was not\nselected for several police car repair contracts, even though it was the low bidder, and Auto Works\nwas no longer called to tow wrecked municipal vehicles. When she finished, Thomas Leonard was\nrecognized by the Township Supervisor, Don Papineau. Thomas arose and spoke:\n       LEONARD:                It’s not right and you guys know it. We want an answer.\n                               We’re sick and tired of getting screwed. You guys are\n                               screwing us and we know it. We’re sitting, the attorneys are\n                               sitting here, he hasn’t read about it, nobody knows nothing\n                               about it. I’m sick of it.\n       PAPINEAU:               I, I disagree that we screwed Leonard’s [Auto Works] or—\n       LEONARD:                You do? Do it right now.\n       PAPINEAU:               Yes, sir, I do.\n       LEONARD:                (inaudible)\n       PAPINEAU:               I disagree with that.\n       LEONARD:                Well, that’s good. That’s why you’re in a God damn\n                               lawsuit—\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                     Page 3\n\n\nThomas then sat down. After he had taken his seat, Papineau said, “Hey, do not use the Lord’s name\nin vain.” Leonard responded, “I’ll do whatever I want, Don, just like you.” At that point, Officer\nRobinson entered the conversation:\n       ROBINSON:               (inaudible)\n       LEONARD:                You stay out of it. I’m not talking to you.\n       ROBINSON:               (inaudible)\n       LEONARD:                No, you come in here, you come here—\n       ROBINSON:               No, I come here as a police officer.\n       LEONARD:                No, you didn’t. Don’t give me a hard time.\n       ROBINSON:               If I’m going to (inaudible) I’m going to take you with me.\n       LEONARD:                I’m ready to go, so, let’s go.\nRobinson took Leonard outside the meeting room and placed him under arrest. Leonard was\ntransported to the police station and charged with violations of Michigan Compiled Laws §§ 750.167\n(disorderly person) and 750.337 (obscenity). He was released after a one-hour detention. One\nmonth later the citation was voided and dismissed.\n        On June 6, 2003, Leonard filed this action against Robinson in his personal capacity in the\nUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleging that Robinson, under color\nof law, violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable seizure. The complain also\nraised three state law torts: battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment. Robinson filed a motion\nfor summary judgment on November 20, 2003. He argued that he was entitled to qualified immunity\non the constitutional allegations and that the state law claims must be dismissed because the arrest\nwas supported by probable cause. To bolster this claim, Robinson cited two additional Michigan\nstatutes that Leonard may have violated, Michigan Compiled Laws §§ 750.103 (cursing and\nswearing) and 750.170 (disturbance of lawful meetings). Leonard filed a response to the motion,\ndefending his claims under a First Amendment retaliation theory and generally asserting the same\ngrounds he does here on appeal.\n        On May 4, 2005, the district court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed\nthe case. Leonard v. Robinson, No. 03-72199, slip op. at 26 (E.D. Mich.) [hereinafter D. Ct. Op.].\nThe district court held that Robinson did not violate the Fourth Amendment because he had probable\ncause to arrest Leonard. Id. at 7. The court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\nstate law claims. D. Ct. Op. at 27 n.17. The court found that even though Michigan Compiled Laws\n§ 750.337 (criminalizing indecent language in the presence of women or children) had been\ninvalidated by the Michigan Supreme Court, other statutes, criminalizing conduct for which Leonard\nhad not been charged, supported the arrest, viz., §§ 750.103 (swearing), 750.170 (disturbing a\nmeeting), and 750.167 (disorderly person). Therefore, based upon these statutes, Robinson had\nprobable cause to arrest Leonard because he had violated the plain language of those statutes and\nRobinson was “to enforce laws until and unless they are declared unconstitutional.” D. Ct. Op. at\n12. See also Devenpeck v.

Ct. Op. at 25.\nThe court held that our precedents “recognize[] a permissible inference of retaliatory motive in only\na particular category of cases: namely, those cases where all of the possible grounds for arrest arise\nsolely during the course of a citizen’s encounter with a police officer.” Id. at 23 (citing McCurdy\nv.

A “motivating factor” is essentially but-for\ncause—“without which the action being challenged simply would not have been taken.” Greene,\n310 F.3d at 897.\n       Probable cause is clearly relevant to Leonard’s First Amendment retaliation claims.

Hartman, 126 S. Ct. at\n1699. Although there are differences between wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution, see id.\nat 1705 (noting that “the causal connection required here is not merely between the retaliatory\nanimus of one person and that person’s own injurious action, but between the retaliatory animus of\none person and the action of another”), there is an obvious similarity in that “the significance of\nprobable cause or the lack of it looms large,” id. at 1706. Hartman, therefore, calls into question\nour cases holding that “probable cause is not determinative of the [First Amendment] constitutional\nquestion.” See Greene, 310 F.3d at 895. Yet, we need not decide whether Hartman adds another\nelement to every First Amendment claim brought pursuant to § 1983 because, when viewed in the\nlight most favorable to the plaintiff, we find that the facts of this case demonstrate an absence of\nprobable cause.\n\fNo. 05-1728               Leonard v.

Again,\nwhen the facts are viewed in a light most favorable to Leonard, we believe that First Amendment\nfreedoms, clearly established for a generation, preclude a finding of probable cause because the laws\ncited by Robinson are either facially invalid, vague, or overbroad when applied to speech (as\nopposed to conduct) at a democratic assembly where the speaker is not out of order.\n                                                          B\n       Robinson relies on four sections of Michigan’s Penal Code defining various misdemeanors.\nLeonard was charged with two violations of Michigan Law. The first is Michigan Compiled Laws\n§ 750.167, defining a disorderly person:\n         (1) A person is a disorderly person if the person is any of the following:\n                (a) A person of sufficient ability who refuses or neglects to support\n                his or her family. (b) A common prostitute. (c) A window peeper.\n                (d) A person who engages in an illegal occupation or business. (e) A\n                person who is intoxicated in a public place and who is either\n                endangering directly the safety of another person or of property or is\n                acting in a manner that causes a public disturbance. (f) A person who\n                is engaged in indecent or obscene conduct in a public place. (g) A\n                vagrant. (h) A person found begging in a public place.

In Robinson’s deposition, he reveals that he believes subsection (f) to be\nmost applicable to Leonard’s conduct at the meeting. The criminal citation also relied upon\nMichigan Compiled Laws § 750.337:\n         INDECENT, ETC., LANGUAGE IN PRESENCE OF WOMEN OR\n         CHILDREN—Any person who shall use any indecent, immoral, obscene, vulgar or\n         insulting language in the presence or hearing of any woman or child shall be guilty\n         of a misdemeanor.\nIbid., invalidated by People v.

No such prosecution shall be sustained\n         unless it shall be commenced within 5 days after the commission of such offense.\nIbid. The next and last law, Michigan Compiled Laws § 750.170, states:\n\n\n         1\n            “To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a plaintiff must set forth facts that, when construed favorably,\nestablish (1) the deprivation of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States (2) caused by a person\nacting under the color of state law.” Sigley v.

Even those who advocate the most narrow\ninterpretation of the freedom of speech agree that in a democratic forum like a township meeting,\nthe state should abstain from regulating speech:\n        Constitutional protection should be accorded only to speech that is explictily [sic]\n        political. There is no basis for judicial intervention to protect any other form of\n        expression, be it scientific, literary or that variety of expression we call obscene or\n        pornographic. Moreover, within that category of speech we ordinarily call political,\n        there should be no constitutional obstruction to laws making criminal any speech that\n        advocates forcible overthrow of the government or the violation of any law.\nRobert H. Bork, Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems, 47 Ind. L.J. 1, 20 (1971).\n        Of course, the constitutional protection of speech is not without limits.

Boomer reversed the conviction of a criminal defendant prosecuted under the law. The man,\nknown to the local media as the cussing canoeist, was convicted for uttering a string of expletives\nin the presence of women and children upon tipping his canoe on the Rifle River. Id. at 256. See\nalso Sarah Kershaw, A 1909 Washington State Law Shielding a Woman’s Virtue Is Being\nChallenged, N.Y. Times, Jan. 26, 2005 at A13. The court determined that it was “unnecessary to\naddress [Boomer’s] overbreadth arguments, or to undertake an extensive First Amendment analysis,\nbecause . . . M.C.L. § 750.337 is unconstitutionally vague.” 655 N.W.2d at 257. The court\nexplained that “in order to pass constitutional muster, a penal statute must define the criminal\noffense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited\nand in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Id. at 258\n(internal quotations and citations omitted).\n       A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and\n       juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of\n       arbitrary and discriminatory application. . . . Uncertain meanings inevitably lead\n       citizens to steer far wider of the unlawful zone than if the boundaries of the forbidden\n       areas were clearly marked.\n               Here, it would be difficult to conceive of a statute that would be more vague\n       than M.C.L. § 750.337. There is no restrictive language whatsoever contained in the\n       statute that would limit or guide a prosecution for indecent, immoral, obscene,\n       vulgar, or insulting language. Allowing a prosecution where one utters “insulting”\n       language could possibly subject a vast percentage of the populace to a misdemeanor\n       conviction.\nId. at 258–59 (emphasis added) (citations, internal quotations, and omissions removed).\n        The court went on to state that, “[the statute], as currently drafted, impinges on First\nAmendment freedoms. . . . [It is] unquestionable that [the statute], as drafted, reaches\nconstitutionally protected speech, and it operates to inhibit the exercise of First Amendment rights.”\nId. at 259. Thus, it is clear that probable cause for Leonard’s arrest is not supported by § 750.337.\nSee Sandul v. Larion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744170\"><a href=\"/opinion/744170/john-sandul-robert-sandul-and-devona-sandul-v-timothy-larion-sgt/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1256 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that protected speech cannot\nserve as the basis for a violation of city ordinances at issue).\n        Michigan’s courts have not commented so clearly and directly upon the constitutionality of\nthe other three statutes at issue in this case. Surely aware of this fact, Robinson argues that Boomer\nsays nothing about the other statutes’ validity because it is well established that:\n              Police are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared\n       unconstitutional.

The Michigan\nSupreme Court held that the law in Boomer was just such a law—that it was “difficult to conceive\nof a statute that would be more vague than M.C.L. § 750.337.” 655 N.W.2d at 258. See also\nSandul, 119 F.3d at 1257 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (arguing that DeFillippo is strengthened in “the\nabsence of any Michigan case law which has held a similar ordinance unconstitutional.”). Similarly,\nviewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, no reasonable police officer would\nbelieve that any of the three other Michigan statutes relied upon by the district court are\nconstitutional as applied to Leonard’s political speech during a democratic assembly.\n         Therefore, and for many of the same reasons relied upon by the Boomer court, we hold that\nMichigan Compiled Laws § 750.167(f), to the extent it is applied to Leonard’s speech, cannot here\nsupport probable cause. First, the plain language of that statute regulates conduct and not speech.\nWe understand indecent or obscene as regulated in § 750.167(f) as regulating “conduct consisting\nof exposing private body parts when one reasonably might expect that they would be viewed\nunwantedly by others,” United States v. Whitmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2471065\"><a href=\"/opinion/2471065/united-states-v-whitmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 698 (E.D. Mich. 2004),\nand not speech. Furthermore, to the extent that § 750.167(f) is intended to regulate speech, we hold\nthat its language is so free of limitation and so closely tracks that of § 750.337 that it is flagrantly\nunconstitutional.\n        Next, we hold that Leonard’s conduct could not have been proscribed by Michigan Compiled\nLaws § 750.103. That law makes “profanely curs[ing] or damn[ing] or swear[ing] by the name of\nGod, Jesus Christ or the Holy Ghost” a crime. Ibid. The Supreme Court has held that a state may\nnot make a “single four-letter expletive a criminal offense.” Cohen v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108360\"><a href=\"/opinion/108360/cohen-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26\n(1971). In Cohen, “the defendant was observed in the Los Angeles County Courthouse . . . wearing\na jacket bearing the words ‘Fuck the Draft.’” Id. at 16. “The defendant [in Cohen] testified that he\nwore the jacket knowing that the words were on the jacket as a means of informing the public of the\ndepth of his feelings against the Vietnam War and the draft.” Ibid. We can find no principled\ndistinction between the expletive in Cohen and the milder profanity in this case.

Section 750.103, if not facially invalid, is\nradically limited by the First Amendment.\n       Finally, we consider Michigan Compiled Laws. § 750.170, prohibiting “[a]ny person who\nshall make or excite any disturbance or contention . . . at any . . . public meeting where citizens are\npeaceably and lawfully assembled.” Although this section may constitutionally proscribe some\nconduct, it has already been held to be overbroad by a Michigan court.

An earlier decision by the Court of Appeals of Michigan had suggested:\n        In all prosecutions under this statute the activity to be punished must be shown to\n        present clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic, or a threat\n        to public safety.

While Mash is somewhat unclear about what expressive conduct may be\nproscribed by the state, when we view the facts here in a light most favorable to Leonard, there is\nno conduct at issue for the statute to prohibit, nor is there conduct upon which Robinson could find\nprobable cause.\n          Application of Mash to these facts is, in the first instance, a job for the district court. For our\npurposes, we consider Leonard’s version of the incident and “view the facts and any inferences\nreasonably drawn from them in the light most favorable to [him.]” Kalamazoo Acquisitions, 395\nF.3d at 342. On this view, there was no disturbance to which a court might apply § 750.170 and no\nreasonable police officer could think so. The exact nature of Leonard’s conduct is instead a disputed\nissue of material fact, and our legal analysis need not consider the merits of that dispute. See\nCureton, 882 F.2d at 215–16. On one view of the facts, Leonard was merely advocating an idea.\nThis cannot support a conviction and it cannot create probable cause.

However, that characterization\nis neither undisputed, nor undisputable. This judge has looked at the same tape, and not only come\nto a slightly different conclusion personally, but more importantly concluded that a rational juror\ncould come to a different conclusion. This judgment means that there is a genuine issue of material\nfact as to whether Leonard’s conduct could constitutionally be considered criminal by any rational\nofficer.\n        We conclude that the statute is unconstitutional as applied by the district court because the\nprocedural posture of the case permits a finding that Leonard merely advocated an idea. This\nconclusion is based upon First Amendment jurisprudence that is decades old. In light of this, and\nof the prominent position that free political speech has in our jurisprudence and in our society, it\ncannot be seriously contended that any reasonable peace officer, or citizen, for that matter, would\nbelieve that mild profanity while peacefully advocating a political position could constitute a\ncriminal act. The facts in this case could lead a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                     Page 11\n\n\ncircumstance of Leonard’s arrest for disturbing the peace were devoid of any indicia of disruption\nor contention. See Mich. Comp. Laws. § 750.170.\n        We therefore hold that no reasonable officer would find that probable cause exists to arrest\na recognized speaker at a chaired public assembly based solely on the content of his speech (albeit\nvigorous or blasphemous) unless and until the speaker is determined to be out of order by the\nindividual chairing the assembly. See Jones v. Heyman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531400\"><a href=\"/opinion/531400/douglas-m-jones-v-richard-a-heyman/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1329 (11th Cir. 1989)\n(holding that the chair of city commission meeting may, without violating the First Amendment,\nhave a speaker removed when she becomes disorderly by speaking off-topic). Any peace officer\nin attendance can reasonably be expected to restrain herself from arresting speakers based upon what\nthey say while advocating their political positions in an orderly fashion. See Houston v. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111919\"><a href=\"/opinion/111919/houston-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461–62 (1987) (noting that a properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to\nexercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen). Therefore, because Leonard’s arrest\nwas not supported by probable cause, it was error for the district court to grant Robinson qualified\nimmunity on the Fourth Amendment claims.\n                                                  E\n         The district court’s analysis of the retaliation claim under Mt. Healthy was also flawed.\nBecause Leonard’s conduct was constitutionally protected and because arrest is particularly suited\nto chill this conduct, see Bloch, 156 F.3d at 679–80 (holding that a combination of embarrassment,\nhumiliation, and emotional distress is sufficient to chill for Mt. Healthy’s purposes), we focus on the\ndistrict court’s evaluation of Robinson’s motive for the arrest. The district court never considered\nwhether Leonard’s exchange with the board was protected speech. It accepted without analysis that\nthe Michigan statutes were valid as applied because no court decision had specifically struck them\ndown in toto. The court then concluded that Michigan had validly proscribed Leonard’s conduct\nbefore the Board and that probable cause existed for an arrest.\n      The district court did not address evidence that was relevant to Robinson’s motivation in\nmaking the arrest. The court noted, that at the moment of arrest:\n       Plaintiff already had commenced his vehement complaints that the township board\n       had been “screwing over” his family’s business, and he already had made the\n       reference to a “goddamn lawsuit” which, as discussed earlier, provided probable\n       cause to arrest for violating Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.103. Moreover, all of these\n       statements were directed at the township supervisor, and not at Defendant.\n       Consequently, when Defendant initially approached Plaintiff and asked him to calm\n       down, there would have been absolutely no reason to suspect that Defendant’s “true\n       motivation was to punish a slight to his dignity.” Rather, Defendant presumably\n       could only have been acting out of an appropriate desire to preserve calm and order\n       at a public meeting, or perhaps with the intention to act upon Plaintiff’s apparent\n       violation of a Michigan statute. At a minimum, there is absolutely no evidence of\n       any improper motive or purpose that might have led Defendant to initiate the\n       encounter with Plaintiff.\nD. Ct. Op. at 21–22 (emphasis added).\n        Although we believe that it is a close case on this point, we reverse. A reasonable factfinder,\nviewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to Leonard, could conclude that he was\narrested in retaliation for constitutionally protected conduct. Leonard’s deposition reveals disputed\nfacts about a prior lawsuit (several lawsuits, according to counsel at oral argument), a feud between\nthe police department and his family, and Chief Abraham’s “hatred” of his wife. The recording of\nthe Township meeting, with Leonard off-camera and recorded only in voice, also creates a triable\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                      Page 12\n\n\nissue on whether Leonard disrupted the meeting and whether Robinson lied about his motive to\nattend.\n        We cannot ignore that Leonard’s testimony on one point is equivocal. In response to the\nquestion, “Do you have any—aside from your opinion that’s happened, do you have any facts or any\nstatements from people to support your opinion [that Robinson was ordered to arrest one of the\nLeonards]?” Leonard answered, “No.” This answer is inconsistent with Leonard’s prior statements\nin the same deposition where he details the circumstances surrounding his wife’s prior lawsuit with\nChief Abraham. In light of this, his answer can be interpreted as a response to a misunderstood\nquestion because it is not unreasonable to infer that the related facts about the political situation in\nMontrose support Leonard’s opinion. We interpret Leonard’s “no” answer to mean that he was\nunaware of any direct admissions from the defendant or Chief Abraham that would definitively\nprove his case. It is not Leonard’s burden to depose every individual whose testimony might add\ncredibility to his allegations in order to oppose Robinson’s motion for summary judgment. These\nare difficult cases to try, see Hartman, 126 S. Ct. at 1705, but the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding Leonard’s arrest are sufficiently odious to support a reasonable inference of retaliatory\nconduct. Robinson could have eliminated these suspicions by deposing Leonard’s wife and mother-\nin-law, whose testimony would tend to either enhance or detract from the veracity of Leonard’s\nallegations. In fact, Leonard’s final witness list prepared for the district court names Sarah Leonard,\nand his mother-in-law, Agnes Johnson, as individuals who may testify for the plaintiff.\n         We hold that Leonard has set out a prima facie case of First Amendment retaliation and has\ncreated a genuine issue of material fact. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A jury could reasonably find that\nRobinson acted out of malice in arresting Leonard. See Musso v. Hourigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499736\"><a href=\"/opinion/499736/edward-musso-v-dale-hourigan-and-lt-darrell-york-individually-and-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (2d\nCir. 1988) (affirming the district court’s denial of qualified immunity on First Amendment\nretaliation allegations of false arrest at an open school board meeting).\n                                                  IV\n      For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the district court’s entry of summary judgment\nand REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v.

Even had Robinson been equipped with this uncommonly\nextensive knowledge of Michigan and federal law, indeed even had Robinson carried a laptop\nequipped with Westlaw and Lexis/Nexis to the meeting, I am hard pressed to understand how he\nwould have known that it was “clearly established” that he could not enforce this law in this setting.\n         The undisputed facts (undisputed because the record contains a video of the incident) show\nthat Robinson observed Leonard at a “public meeting where citizens were peaceably and lawfully\nassembled,” Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.170, yelling, swearing and answering requests with the words\n“I’ll do what I want.” JA 152. What starts as a pointed, but seemingly controlled, exchange\nbetween Leonard and a board member turns into Leonard speaking over the board member and\ndegenerates into Leonard losing control and simply yelling at the board member. At that stage,\nwhen Robinson stepped in, Leonard not only had created a “disturbance” at this public meeting but\nalso had lost control of himself. One can only wonder where the verbal confrontation was heading,\nand it is doubtful that a single one of the 25 or so people in attendance (save the Leonards) regretted\nRobinson’s decision to take action. A reasonable police officer could fairly believe that Leonard\nhad “excite[d] [a] disturbance,” Mich. Comp. Laws § 750.170, either by “interfer[ing]” with the\ncouncil meeting’s “due progress” by “refusing” to abide by the council member’s requests,\nWeinberg, 149 N.W.2d at 251; see also Mash, 206 N.W.2d at 770, or by “hinder[ing]” the meeting\nfrom “conduct[ing] [its] business” by yelling and cursing during the meeting, Weinberg, 149 N.W.2d\nat 252.\n        It may be true that Robinson did not wait for the chair to call Leonard “out of order.” See\nMaj. Op. at 11.

But in that case “two\nNinth Circuit cases [were] directly on point” because they had declared parallel statutes of other\nStates—permitting an arrest for refusing to identify oneself—unconstitutional. Id. at 881. That of\ncourse does not remotely describe today’s case. Nor does Sandul v. Larion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744170\"><a href=\"/opinion/744170/john-sandul-robert-sandul-and-devona-sandul-v-timothy-larion-sgt/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n1997), offer any refuge to Leonard. It dealt not with the question whether an officer could be denied\nqualified immunity for failing to predict a judicial ruling declaring a statute unconstitutional but with\nwhether the statute covered the plaintiff’s conduct. See id. at 1256 (holding that shouting epithets\nfrom a moving car did not provide probable cause to arrest the plaintiff under a disorderly-conduct\nstatute).\n        In the end, Leonard not only asks us to take a road less traveled but one never traveled. It\nis one thing to credit police officers with knowledge of all statutory and constitutional rulings\npotentially bearing on all statutes they enforce; but this necessary requirement needlessly loses any\nconnection with reality when we hold police officers to the standard of anticipating a court’s later\ninvalidation of a statute that was duly enacted by legislators sworn to uphold the Constitution, that\nis presumed constitutional, that has been on the books for 75 years and that has withstood two\nconstitutional challenges. The First Amendment properly protected Leonard from being prosecuted\nfor his unruly speech and conduct—and for now that is enough. To expose Robinson to money\ndamages for enforcing these laws not only seems unfair (absolute immunity protects the legislature\nfrom similar risks, Bogan v. Scott-Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118178\"><a href=\"/opinion/118178/bogan-v-scott-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48–49 (1998)) but also risks placing him in\nthe push-me-pull-me predicament of having to decide which duly enacted laws to enforce and which\nones not to enforce on the pain of losing either way—because he is charged with dereliction of duty\nwhen he opts not to enforce the law and because he is charged with money damages when he does\nenforce the law. See Pierson v. Ray, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107411\"><a href=\"/opinion/107411/pierson-v-ray/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (1967) (“A policeman’s lot is not so\nunhappy that he must choose between being charged with dereliction of duty if he does not arrest\nwhen he has probable cause, and being mulcted in damages if he does.”).\n        Leonard fares no better under his free-speech retaliation claim. Because probable cause\nexisted to arrest Leonard, as has been shown, our case law forecloses this claim as a matter of law.\nSee Barnes v. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794492\"><a href=\"/opinion/794492/wilbur-barnes-v-tony-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720 (6th Cir. 2006) (“[T]he defendants had probable cause to\nseek an indictment and to arrest Barnes on each of the criminal charges in this case. Barnes’s First\nAmendment retaliation claim accordingly fails as a matter of law . . . .”).\n       But even had probable cause been missing, this claim still would fail as a matter of law. No\nevidence shows that Robinson was doing anything but attempting to restore calm to the disrupted\nboard meeting. Robinson gave no indication of a retaliatory motive. Cf. Greene v. Barber, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779855\"><a href=\"/opinion/779855/anthony-c-greene-v-jack-barber-edward-hillyer-victor-gillis-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892 (6th Cir. 2002) (“‘I said, “This is the United States of America and we have freedom of\nspeech here” . . . . [The police officer] answered, “Well, not in my building” . . . .’”) (bracket\nomitted); Adair v. Charter County of Wayne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794749\"><a href=\"/opinion/794749/michael-adair-william-childress-leon-denton-charles-elstone-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (6th Cir. 2006) (noting that the\n\fNo. 05-1728           Leonard v. Robinson                                                    Page 17\n\n\ncritical issue is “whether the adverse action was motivated at least in part as a response to the\nexercise of the plaintiff’s constitutional rights”). None of Leonard’s speech was directed at\nRobinson. And no evidence shows that Robinson had any stake in the dispute between the city and\nthe Leonards. Prior lawsuits between the city and the Leonards, a feud between the police\ndepartment and the Leonards and Chief Abraham’s apparent “hatred” of Leonard’s wife thus do not\nbear on whether Robinson had a retaliatory motive.\n         The fainthearted suggestion that Chief Abraham had sent Robinson on a retaliatory errand\nis just that—if not less than that. “I think,” Leonard initially proposes in his deposition testimony,\nthat Robinson “was probably sent there by the chief.” JA 151. But Leonard then acknowledges that\n“aside from [his] opinion,” he did not “have any facts or any statements from people to support [that]\nopinion.” Id. The undisputed evidence reveals that Robinson was asked to “swing through” the\nmeeting for 15 to 20 minutes, that Chief Abraham never said “anything negative to [Robinson] about\nthe Leonards” and that no board member had any conversation with Robinson about Mr. Leonard.\nJA 138. The majority seeing these issues differently, I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
