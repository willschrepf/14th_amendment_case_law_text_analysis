William Shea, a white Foreign Service\nOfficer, brings suit alleging that the hiring plan violated Title\nVII. Although Shea challenges a plan that ceased to exist\nover twenty years ago, he joined the Foreign Service during\nthe two years the plan was in effect. He alleges that, because\nof the plan, he entered the Foreign Service at a lower level\nthan would have been the case had he been a minority\napplicant.\n\n    The district court viewed Shea’s claim to be controlled by\nthe Supreme Court’s decisions in Johnson v. Transportation\nAgency, Santa Clara County, California, 480 U.S. 616\n(1987), and United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO-CLC\nv. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979). Those decisions upheld\nemployers’ affirmative action plans against Title VII\nchallenges. The district court, following Johnson and Weber,\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the State Department.\nWe agree with the district court and affirm its judgment.\n\n                               I.\n\n                               A.\n\n    The United States Foreign Service, a branch of the\nUnited States Department of State, works through its Foreign\nService Officers to “advocate American foreign policy,\nprotect American citizens, and promote American interests\n\f                              3\nthroughout the world.” Taylor v. Rice, 451 F.3d 898, 900\n(D.C. Cir. 2006).       Foreign Service Officers “perform\ntraditional diplomatic responsibilities, including trade\npromotion, political and economic reporting, and consular\nservices and protection.” Id.\n\n     In 1990, Shea applied for an entry-level Foreign Service\nOfficer position. At the time, the Foreign Service career\nladder consisted of six pay grades, ranging from FS-06 (entry\nlevel) to FS-01 (upper level), with the Senior Foreign Service\n(SFS) a step above FS-01. The Department generally filled\nvacancies at more senior ranks through internal promotions\nrather than external hires. Applicants from outside the agency\nthus ordinarily entered the Officer corps only at the junior\nlevels (FS-04, -05 and -06 levels). In May 1992, Shea joined\nthe Foreign Service at the FS-05 level.\n\n                             B.\n\n     In the years preceding Shea’s application to the Foreign\nService, the State Department faced significant scrutiny about\nthe lack of diversity of the Foreign Service Officer corps. In\n1985, Congress perceived an underrepresentation of\nminorities among Foreign Service Officers.           Congress\ntherefore enacted legislation directing the Department to\n“develop . . . a plan designed to increase significantly the\nnumber of members of minority groups . . . in the Foreign\nService,” with a “particular emphasis on achieving significant\nincreases in the numbers of minority group members . . . in\nthe mid-levels of the Foreign Service,” the FS-02 and -03\nlevels. Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years\n1986 and 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-93, § 152(a), (b), 99 Stat. 405,\n428 (1985).\n\f                                4\n     Two years later, Congress remained unsatisfied.\nConcluding that the State Department “ha[d] not been\nsuccessful in [its] efforts . . . to recruit and retain members of\nminority groups,” Congress instructed the Department to\n“substantially increase [its] efforts” to ensure that the\n“Foreign Service becomes truly representative of the\nAmerican people throughout all levels of the Foreign\nService.” Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years\n1988 and 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-204, § 183(a), (a)(1), (b)(1),\n101 Stat. 1331, 1364 (1987). Congress specifically directed\nthe Department to “ensure that those [efforts] effectively\naddress the need to promote increased numbers of\nqualified . . . members of minority groups into the senior\nlevels of the Foreign Service.” Id. § 183(b)(2).\n\n     Congress did not stand alone in raising concerns about\nthe diversity of the Foreign Service Officer corps. In 1989,\nthe General Accounting Office (now known as the\nGovernmental Accountability Office) released a report\nentitled “State Department: Minorities and Women Are\nUnderrepresented in the Foreign Service.” The 1989 GAO\nReport evaluated the Department’s existing efforts, finding\nthat, while “[p]rogress ha[d] been mixed” in increasing\ndiversity,\n\n       [m]inorities . . . were    still substantially\n       underrepresented when compared with civilian\n       labor force data that the EEOC ha[d] issued to\n       measure federal agencies. . . .\n\n        In mid-level ranks of the officer corps,\n       minority male representation ha[d] increased,\n       but minority and white women ha[d] made less\n       progress. In State’s Senior Foreign Service\n\f                              5\n       positions, underrepresentation of minorities\n       and white women [wa]s still pervasive.\n\nU.S. Gen. Accounting Office, State Department: Minorities\nand Women Are Underrepresented in the Foreign Service 15\n(1989) (1989 GAO Report).\n\n     The 1989 GAO Report compared the Department’s 1987\nminority workforce with the racial breakdown of the\nAmerican population possessing the skills required for\nForeign Service employment. That comparison indicated that\nthe Department generally fell short of “full representation”—\nthe level at which a minority group would make up the same\nproportion of the workforce as its proportion of the American\npopulation possessing the relevant skills—at mid- and senior-\nlevel Foreign Service Officer positions, as follows: for\nwomen of each defined minority group at the SFS, FS-01,\n-02, and -03 levels; black, Native American and native\nAlaskan men at the SFS level; Hispanic men at the SFS and\nFS-01 levels; and Asian and Pacific Islander men at the SFS,\nFS-01, -02, and -03 levels.\n\n    The Civil Service Subcommittee of the House Committee\non Post Office and Civil Service convened hearings focusing\non the 1989 GAO Report’s findings and on the results of two\nother studies—the Bremer Study Group Report\n(commissioned by the Secretary of State on his own initiative)\nand the Thomas Commission Report (mandated by Congress\nas part of the 1988-1989 Foreign Relations Authorization\nAct). Representative Gerry Sikorski, the Subcommittee’s\nChairman, interpreted those two studies to “disclose[] major\nproblems of discrimination against . . . minorities in the\nForeign Service.”     Underrepresentation of Women and\nMinorities in the Foreign Service: Hearing Before the\nSubcomm. on the Civil Serv. of the H. Comm. on Post Office\n\f                               6\n& Civil Serv., 101st Cong. 3 (1989) (1989 Subcomm.\nHearing).    Those studies, he concluded, revealed that\n“management of the U.S. Foreign Service [was] seriously\nflawed.” The Department of State in the 21st Century: Joint\nHearing Before the Subcomm. on Int’l Ops. of the H. Comm.\non Foreign Affairs & the Subcomm. on the Civil Serv. of the\nH. Comm. on Post Office & Civil Serv., 101st Cong. 6 (1989)\n(1989 Joint Hearing).\n\n     As of 1989, minorities remained underrepresented in\nForeign Service Officer roles. Id. And that was after years of\nconcerns voiced by Congress and repeated warnings from the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission “that the State\nDepartment ha[d] not had an effective . . . plan or program for\novercoming the underrepresentation [of minorities] in the\nForeign Service.” U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Testimony:\nUnderrepresentation of Minorities and Women in the Foreign\nService, Statement of Joseph Kelley, Director of Security and\nInternational Relations Issues, National Security and\nInternational Affairs Division, Before the Subcommittee on\nCivil Service, Committee on Post Office and Civil Service,\nUnited States House of Representatives 1 (1989). The\nDepartment undertook various measures in response,\nincluding creating a special hiring path for minorities into the\nForeign Service’s mid- and upper-level ranks—the\naffirmative action plan in issue here.\n\n                              C.\n\n     At the time of Shea’s entry into the Foreign Service, the\nState Department operated two distinct programs that enabled\napplicants to bypass the Department’s usual preference for\ninternal promotions and allowed the direct hiring of outside\napplicants into mid- and upper-level (FS-01, -02 and -03)\npositions. One program, the Career Candidate Program\n\f                              7\n(CCP), was race-neutral. The other program, the 1990-92\nAffirmative Action Plan (1990-92 Plan), targeted minority\napplicants.\n\n     Under the CCP, the Department accepted certain\napplications from outside candidates for FS-01, -02, and -03\npositions. But the Department, in accordance with its general\npreference for filling vacancies through internal promotions,\ncould hire an otherwise viable outside applicant through the\nCCP only if the Department issued a “certificate of need”\nattesting that no internal candidates could fill that vacancy.\nThe Department would then consider the outside applicant\nconsistent with its typical hiring procedures. In the absence\nof a certificate of need, no outside candidate could receive an\noffer of employment through the CCP.\n\n     Under the race-conscious 1990-92 Plan, the Department\nprovided a special path for minorities seeking direct\nplacement as outside hires into the FS-01, -02, and -03 ranks.\nThe 1990-92 Plan gave one—and only one—advantage to\nminority applicants: an automatic waiver of the CCP’s\ncertificate-of-need requirement for “American Indians, Alaska\nNative[s], Asians and Pacific Islanders, Blacks, and\nHispanics.” U.S. Dep’t of State, Foreign Service Mid-Level\nHiring Program Highlights 1 (1989). Apart from the\ncertificate-of-need waiver at the threshold stage, the 1990-92\nPlan granted no benefits to minorities in the course of the\nhiring process. That process was rigorous: The “vast\nmajority” of minority candidates applying through the 1990-\n92 Plan “were eliminated from competition at the preliminary\nreview stage.” Id.\n\f                                8\n                               D.\n\n     In 2001, Shea filed an administrative grievance with the\nState Department. Among other claims, he argued that he\nstarted at a lower pay grade by virtue of the 1990-92 Plan’s\npreferential treatment of minority applicants, infringing his\nrights under Title VII as well as the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment.         The Foreign Service Grievance Board\ndismissed his complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and Shea then\nfiled suit in the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia.\n\n     Shea’s case initially traveled back and forth between the\ndistrict court and this court on the question of whether his\nTitle VII and equal protection claims had been timely filed.\n(As to the remaining claims, Shea did not appeal their\ndismissal.) See Shea v. Kerry, 961 F. Supp. 2d 17, 22-25\n(D.D.C. 2013). Ultimately, after Congress enacted the Lilly\nLedbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat.\n5, the district court found that Shea’s Title VII claims were\ntimely under the Ledbetter Act but that his equal protection\nclaims were untimely. See id. at 24, 29 & n.3.\n\n     Proceeding to the merits, the district court granted\nsummary judgment to the State Department. Id. at 55. The\ncourt first determined that the Supreme Court’s Title VII\naffirmative action decisions in Weber, 443 U.S. 193, and\nJohnson, 480 U.S. 616, controlled the analysis. Those\ndecisions, the district court explained, called for application of\nthe three-step burden-shifting framework articulated by the\nCourt in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\n(1973). Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 27-29.\n\f                                9\n     At the first step, the district court concluded that Shea\nhad established a prima facie case of discrimination in\nviolation of Title VII. Id. at 31-33. Turning to the second\nstep, the court found that the Department had proffered\nevidence that, if accepted as true, permitted the conclusion\nthat the Department had acted pursuant to a lawful affirmative\naction plan. Id. at 33-44. Finally, at the third step, the district\ncourt considered whether Shea had shown that the affirmative\naction plan was, in fact, unlawful. The court rejected Shea’s\nproffer of lay statistical evidence to that end, and thus\nconcluded that he had failed to raise any genuine issue\nconcerning the validity of the Department’s affirmative action\nplan. The court therefore granted summary judgment in favor\nof the Department. Id. at 55.\n\n                                II.\n\n     We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment on Shea’s Title VII claim. Holcomb v. Powell, 433\nF.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Before addressing the merits\nof that claim, we first assure ourselves of Shea’s standing to\nbring it. Although the Department raises no challenge to his\nstanding, “it is well established that the court has an\nindependent obligation to assure that standing exists,\nregardless of whether it is challenged by any of the parties.”\nSummers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009).\n\n     To demonstrate his standing, Shea must show, inter alia,\nthat he suffered an injury in fact that is both “concrete and\nparticularized” and “actual or imminent, not conjectural or\nhypothetical.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560 (1992) (quotation marks omitted). In the context of an\nemployment discrimination claim, a plaintiff may claim an\ninjury in fact from the purported denial of the ability to\ncompete on an equal footing against other candidates for a\n\f                               10\njob. See Ne. Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors\nof Am. v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., 508 U.S. 656, 666 (1993);\nCerrato v. S.F. Cmty. Coll. Dist., 26 F.3d 968, 976 (9th Cir.\n1994). Because the injury lies in the denial of an equal\nopportunity to compete, not the denial of the job itself, we do\nnot inquire into the plaintiff’s qualifications (or lack thereof)\nwhen assessing standing. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, 438 U.S. 265, 280-81 & n.14 (1978).\n\n    Shea alleges that the 1990-92 Plan denied him the\nopportunity to compete on an equal basis by extending a\npreference to minority candidates that was unavailable to him:\nthe ability to gain consideration for entry to a mid-level\nposition without any certificate of need. Shea could have\nsought direct mid-level placement through the race-neutral\nCCP program, however. He did not do so, instead applying\nonly for an entry-level FS-05 position. There is thus a\nquestion whether Shea suffered an actual or imminent injury\nas a result of the 1990-92 Plan, or whether his injury was\nmerely hypothetical.\n\n     The Supreme Court’s decision in Gratz v. Bollinger, 539\nU.S. 244 (2003), found the existence of standing in parallel\ncircumstances. In Gratz, one of the plaintiffs, Patrick\nHamacher, sought to challenge the University of Michigan’s\nconsideration of race in its undergraduate transfer admissions.\nAt the time of the suit, Hamacher had yet to apply to transfer\nto Michigan. Indeed, the Court’s opinion indicated that he\nwould not do so as long as Michigan’s race-conscious\nadmissions program remained in place: Hamacher instead\ndeclared that he “intend[ed] to transfer to the University of\nMichigan when [it] cease[d] the use of race as an admissions\npreference.” Id. at 261 (emphasis added). The Supreme\nCourt sua sponte questioned Hamacher’s standing to bring his\nchallenge, ultimately concluding that he had shown an injury\n\f                               11\nin fact. The Court reasoned that, because of Hamacher’s\nstated intent to transfer should Michigan change its policy, he\nhad established standing. Id. at 261-62.\n\n      Gratz controls our inquiry. Like Hamacher, Shea alleges\nthat he possessed an intent to apply to the position in question,\ni.e., a mid-level position. Pl.’s Decl. in Supp. of Pl.’s\nSurreply at 3-4 (filed Dec. 14, 2012). If the mid-levels had\nbeen open to him for equal consideration on a race-neutral\nfooting, he would have applied to the mid-levels instead of\nthe entry-level. Thus, like Hamacher, Shea stood “able and\nready to apply [to the mid-levels] should the [State\nDepartment] cease to use race” as a factor in mid-level hiring.\nId. (quotation marks omitted). By choosing not to apply\nbecause the Department was considering race during the time\nof his application process, Shea did exactly what Hamacher\nalleged he would do: refuse to apply through the race-\nconscious program unless and until that program’s use of\nrace-conscious preferences ceased. As a result, Shea, like\nHamacher, has standing to challenge the Department’s\naffirmative action plan notwithstanding his failure to apply for\na mid-level position through the CCP program.\n\n                              III.\n\n     Title VII prohibits an employer from “discriminat[ing]\nagainst any individual with respect to his compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of”\ninter alia, “such individual’s race.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n2(a)(1). The statute protects both minorities and non-\nminorities—the latter against “reverse discrimination.” See\nMastro v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 447 F.3d 843, 851 (D.C.\nCir. 2006). Here, Shea alleges that the State Department’s\n1990-92      Plan     constituted     impermissible  reverse\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII.\n\f                              12\n\n                              A.\n\n     At the outset, we consider the governing framework for\nresolving Shea’s reverse-discrimination claim. For nearly\nthirty years, we have examined Title VII challenges to\naffirmative action programs under the standards set forth by\nthe Supreme Court in United Steelworkers of America, AFL-\nCIO-CLC v. Weber, 443 U.S. 193 (1979), and Johnson v.\nTransportation Agency, Santa Clara County, California, 480\nU.S. 616 (1987). Shea argues that those standards have been\ndisplaced by the Supreme Court’s decision in Ricci v.\nDeStefano, 557 U.S. 557 (2009), such that Johnson and\nWeber no longer guide the analysis of reverse-discrimination\nclaims under Title VII. We are unpersuaded.\n\n                              1.\n\n     In Weber, the Supreme Court for the first time considered\na Title VII challenge to an employer’s affirmative action plan.\nAs of 1974, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. had an\n“almost exclusively white craftwork force[],” with black\nemployees making up only 1.83% of the company’s skilled\ncraftworkers at its Gramercy, Louisiana, plant, even though\nthe workforce in the area surrounding that plant was roughly\n39% black. Weber, 443 U.S. at 198-99. As part of a\ncollective-bargaining agreement, Kaiser promised to\nimplement “an affirmative action plan designed to eliminate\n[that] conspicuous racial imbalance[].” Id. at 198. The\ncompany established job-training programs to teach both\nblack and white employees the necessary skills for promotion\nto craftworker positions. Id. at 198-99. Selection of trainees\nfor the program would be made on the basis of seniority, but\n“with the proviso that at least 50% of the new trainees were to\nbe black until the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in\n\f                              13\nthe Gramercy plant approximated the percentage of blacks in\nthe local labor force.” Id. at 199. A white unskilled\nproduction worker from the plant sued, arguing that Title VII\nprohibited all race-conscious employer actions. Id. at 199,\n201.\n\n     The Supreme Court disagreed and upheld Kaiser’s\naffirmative action plan. The Court declined to “define in\ndetail the line of demarcation between permissible and\nimpermissible affirmative action plans,” but concluded that\nKaiser’s plan fell “on the permissible side of the line.” Id. at\n208. The trainee-selection plan, the Court approvingly noted,\naimed to “break down old patterns of racial segregation and\nhierarchy” and “open employment opportunities for [black\nworkers] in occupations which have been traditionally closed\nto them.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). The Court set out\nthe considerations that caused it to uphold the company’s plan\nas follows:\n\n       [T]he plan does not unnecessarily trammel the\n       interests of the white employees. The plan\n       does not require the discharge of white\n       workers and their replacement with new black\n       hirees. Nor does the plan create an absolute\n       bar to the advancement of white employees;\n       half of those trained in the program will be\n       white. Moreover, the plan is a temporary\n       measure; it is not intended to maintain racial\n       balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest\n       racial imbalance. Preferential selection of craft\n       trainees at the Gramercy plant will end as soon\n       as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers\n       in the Gramercy plant approximates the\n       percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\n\f                              14\nId. at 208-09 (citation omitted). For those reasons, the plan\nfell “within the area of discretion left by Title VII to the\nprivate sector voluntarily to adopt affirmative action plans\ndesigned to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalance in\ntraditionally segregated job categories.” Id. at 209.\n\n                              2.\n\n     Nine years later, in Johnson, the Court again rejected a\nTitle VII challenge to an employer’s affirmative action\nprogram. The case arose from the efforts of Santa Clara\nCounty, California, to increase diversity in portions of its\nworkforce. The County sought to address a striking gender\nimbalance in certain positions: Women constituted 36.4% of\nthe labor market in the area, but “none of [the County’s] 238\nSkilled Craft Worker positions was held by a woman.”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 621. The County implemented a\nvoluntary affirmative action plan with a stated “long-term\ngoal” to “attain a work force whose composition reflected the\nproportion of minorities and women in the area labor force.”\nId. at 621-22.       The County’s plan “authorized the\nconsideration of ethnicity or sex as a factor when evaluating\nqualified candidates for jobs in which members of such\ngroups were poorly represented,” but it did not set aside a\nspecific number of hiring slots for women or racial minorities.\nId. at 622.\n\n     In upholding the County’s plan, the Court determined\nthat the analysis should follow the three-step burden-shifting\nframework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n411 U.S. 792 (1973). Under that framework:\n\n       Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\n       that race or sex has been taken into account in\n       an employer’s employment decision [step one],\n\f                              15\n       the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a\n       nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision\n       [step two]. The existence of an affirmative\n       action plan provides such a rationale. If such a\n       plan is articulated as the basis for the\n       employer’s decision, the burden shifts to the\n       plaintiff to prove that the employer’s\n       justification is pretextual and the plan is\n       invalid [step three].\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Application of that framework, the\nJohnson Court emphasized, “does not mean . . . that reliance\non an affirmative action plan is to be treated as an affirmative\ndefense requiring the employer to carry the burden of proving\nthe validity of the plan. The burden of proving its invalidity\nremains on the plaintiff.” Id. at 627.\n\n     The Johnson Court explained that it would “be guided by\n[its] decision in Weber.” Id. In Weber, the Court noted, it\nhad blessed an affirmative action plan that (i) sought to\n“eliminate manifest racial imbalances in traditionally\nsegregated job categories”; and (ii) did not “unnecessarily\ntrammel the interests of white employees.” Id. at 628-30.\nThe Court found the requisite “manifest imbalance” to exist in\nJohnson in light of the complete absence of women in the\npositions in question. Id. at 636. The Court further\ndetermined that the County’s plan did not “unnecessarily\ntrammel[] the rights of male employees” based on a number\nof factors (without ascribing weight or rank to any single\none). Id. at 637-40. In particular, the plan imposed “goals,”\nnot “quotas.” Id. at 638. The plan worked such that “[n]o\npersons [were] automatically excluded from consideration; all\n[were] able to have their qualifications weighed against those\nof other applicants,” with gender considered only as a “plus.”\nId. The plan did not abrogate any “absolute entitlement” of\n\f                              16\nmale employees, as it operated only in the context of\npromotions, the denial of which would “unsettle[] no\nlegitimate, firmly rooted expectation[s].” Id. And the plan\nwas temporary, in that it “was intended to attain a balanced\nwork force, not to maintain one.” Id. at 639.\n\n     For nearly three decades, Johnson has guided courts—\nincluding ours—in the analysis of Title VII claims alleging\nunlawful reverse discrimination. See, e.g., Hammon v. Barry\n(Hammon II), 826 F.2d 73 (D.C. Cir. 1987); see also Petitti v.\nNew England Tel. & Tel. Co., 909 F.2d 28 (1st Cir. 1990);\nTaxman v. Bd. of Educ., 91 F.3d 1547 (3d Cir. 1996) (en\nbanc); Smith v. Va. Commonwealth Univ., 84 F.3d 672 (4th\nCir. 1996) (en banc); Edwards v. City of Houston, 37 F.3d\n1097 (5th Cir. 1994); Janowiak v. Corporate City of S. Bend,\n836 F.2d 1034 (7th Cir. 1984); Tharp v. Iowa Dep’t of Corr.,\n68 F.3d 223 (8th Cir. 1995); Doe v. Kamehameha\nSch./Bernice Pauahi Bishop Estate, 470 F.3d 827 (9th Cir.\n2006) (en banc); Cunico v. Pueblo Sch. Dist. No. 60, 917 F.2d\n431 (10th Cir. 1990); In re Birmingham Reverse\nDiscrimination Emp’t Litig., 20 F.3d 1525 (11th Cir. 1994).\n\n                               3.\n\n     In 2009, the Supreme Court decided Ricci v. DeStefano,\n557 U.S. 557. In Ricci, the Court considered the City of New\nHaven’s actions in the aftermath of the City’s administration\nof a firefighter promotional examination. The results of the\nexam showed a statistical racial disparity: White candidates\nhad outperformed minority candidates. Id. at 562. Some\nfirefighters threatened to bring a discrimination lawsuit if the\nCity relied on the test in making promotions. Id. The City\nresponded by throwing out the test results. A group of white\nand Hispanic firefighters sued the City under Title VII,\n\f                               17\nclaiming that, by discarding the test, the City had engaged in\nunlawful reverse discrimination against them. Id. at 562-63.\n\n     The Supreme Court ruled in the firefighters’ favor. The\nCourt understood that the City’s “objective” in discarding the\ntests was to “avoid[] disparate-impact liability” under Title\nVII. Id. at 579. But the Court concluded that, by rejecting the\nresults of the promotional test “because of the statistical\ndisparity based on race,” the City had engaged in “express,\nrace-based decisionmaking.” Id. The Court held that “race-\nbased action like the City’s in this case is impermissible under\nTitle VII unless the employer can demonstrate a strong basis\nin evidence that, had it not taken the action, it would have\nbeen liable under” Title VII’s disparate-impact prohibition.\nId. at 563; see id. at 585. That is, the Court held that the City\ncould not invalidate the test results based on the race of the\nhighest scorers for the asserted purpose of avoiding a\ndisparate-impact lawsuit, unless the City had a strong basis in\nevidence to believe that it would be found liable in such a\nsuit. The City could not meet that burden. Id. at 592.\n\n     Shea argues that Ricci upends Johnson and Weber such\nthat those earlier decisions no longer guide our analysis here.\nUnder Johnson and Weber, we would first assess the\nsufficiency of Shea’s prima facie case, then turn to the State\nDepartment’s proffer of a valid affirmative action plan, and\nfinally examine Shea’s efforts to demonstrate the invalidity of\nthat plan. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Throughout, Shea\nwould retain the burden of proving the invalidity of the\nDepartment’s 1990-92 Plan. Id. at 627. Ricci changed all of\nthis, Shea submits: After Ricci, Shea argues, we must jettison\nJohnson and Weber’s framework and instead ask whether the\nState Department can show “a strong basis in evidence that,\nhad it not [instituted an affirmative action plan], it would have\nbeen liable” for discrimination under Title VII. Ricci, 557\n\f                              18\nU.S. at 563 (emphasis added). And, if the Department proves\nunable to put forth the requisite “strong basis in evidence” in\nsupport of that showing, Shea contends, the Department\nwould be liable under Title VII for impermissible reverse\ndiscrimination.\n\n     The Department initially argues that Shea forfeited any\nargument based on Ricci by failing to present that argument to\nthe district court.     We disagree.      Although forfeiture\nprinciples apply to new arguments raised for the first time on\nappeal, see Potter v. District of Columbia, 558 F.3d 542, 547\n(D.C. Cir. 2009), Shea’s argument has been consistent\nthroughout the litigation: The Department’s 1990-92 Plan\nimpermissibly discriminated against him in violation of Title\nVII. On appeal, Shea enjoys a measure of latitude to\nelaborate on his theory in service of the same argument. His\nreliance on Ricci for the first time on appeal lies within that\nlatitude. Moreover, although Shea did not press a Ricci-based\nargument before the district court, the district court invoked\nRicci on its own, observing that “nothing in Ricci directly\noverturns or modifies Johnson, at least as it applies to this\ncase.” Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 54 n.17. Shea is permitted to\nrespond on appeal by explaining why he thinks Ricci governs\nthis case. See Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558\nU.S. 310, 330 (2010).\n\n    Shea’s argument based on Ricci fails on the merits,\nhowever. Johnson and Weber are directly applicable to this\ncase. They set out the framework for “evaluating the\ncompliance of an affirmative action plan with Title VII’s\nprohibition on discrimination,” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 640, the\nprecise question in issue here.             Those decisions\nunquestionably would control our analysis unless a\nsubsequent decision dictates otherwise. Ricci is not such a\ndecision. In reaching that conclusion, we draw guidance from\n\f                               19\nthe Supreme Court’s admonition against concluding that its\n“more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier\nprecedent.” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997).\nRather, if “a precedent of [the Supreme] Court has direct\napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in\nsome other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should\nfollow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the] Court\nthe prerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Id.\n\n     Here, Johnson and Weber have “direct application,” and\nwe have no occasion or cause to conclude that Ricci, “by\nimplication,” overruled those decisions. Id. Indeed, Ricci\ndoes not mention or even cite—much less discuss—Johnson\nand Weber. That is understandable, as Ricci, by its own\ndescription, addressed a particular situation not in issue here.\nCf. Ricci, 557 U.S. at 626 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“[Ricci]\ndoes not involve affirmative action.”). In Ricci, the Court’s\n“analysis beg[an] with this premise: The City’s actions would\nviolate the disparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII absent\nsome valid defense.” Id. at 579. The inquiry prescribed by\nJohnson and Weber, by contrast, pertains to assessing whether\nthere is a violation of Title VII’s disparate-treatment\nprohibition in the first place, the same question we address\nhere.\n\n     The specific question addressed in Ricci was whether,\neven though the City’s action in discarding the test results was\nassumed to violate Title VII’s disparate-treatment prohibition,\nthat action could be justified based on a particular objective\nasserted by the City: avoiding liability in a Title VII disparate-\nimpact lawsuit. The Court expressly framed its holding by\nreference to actions taken for that particular purpose:\n\n       We hold only that, under Title VII, before an\n       employer can engage in intentional\n\f                               20\n       discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n       avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n       disparate impact, the employer must have a\n       strong basis in evidence to believe it will be\n       subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to\n       take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\n\nId; see id. at 580 (“We consider, therefore, whether the\npurpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what\notherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment\ndiscrimination.”) (emphasis added).\n\n    The employers in Johnson and Weber did not modify the\noutcomes of personnel processes for the asserted purpose of\navoiding disparate-impact liability under Title VII. Nor did\nthe State Department here. The Department, like the\nemployers in Johnson and Weber, instead acted to “expand[]\njob opportunities for minorities and women,” Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 622, and to “eliminate traditional patterns of racial\nsegregation,” Weber, 443 U.S. at 201; see id. at 209 & n.9.\nRicci does not purport to reach the Department’s actions in\npursuit of those purposes. Weber and Johnson therefore still\ncontrol. The only other court of appeals of which we are\naware to have addressed the interaction between Ricci and the\nJohnson-Weber framework reached the same conclusion. See\nUnited States v. Brennan, 650 F.3d 65, 102-04 (2d Cir. 2011).\n\n                               IV.\n\n     Under the framework established by Johnson and Weber,\nwe ask first if Shea establishes a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. Second, we examine whether the State\nDepartment can articulate a nondiscriminatory reason—in this\ncase, a valid affirmative action plan—for its actions. Finally,\nwe assess whether Shea carries his burden to prove that the\n\f                              21\nDepartment’s plan is invalid. The district court found that\nShea and the Department made the requisite showings at the\nfirst and second steps, respectively. The court then found\nShea to falter at the third step and therefore granted summary\njudgment in favor of the Department. We agree at each step.\n\n                              A.\n\n     We first address whether Shea has made out a prima facie\ncase of reverse discrimination in violation of Title VII. At the\noutset, we note that neither party has addressed the potential\nimplications of our decision in Brady v. Office of Sergeant at\nArms, 520 F.3d 490 (D.C. Cir. 2008), for Johnson’s direction\nto assess whether the “plaintiff establishes a prima facie\ncase,” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Brady explained that, when\n“an employee has suffered an adverse employment action and\nan employer has asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory\nreason for the decision, the district court need not—and\nshould not—decide whether the plaintiff actually made out a\nprima facie case.” 520 F.3d at 494. Rather, “the district court\nmust resolve one central question: Has the employee\nproduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that\nthe employer’s asserted non-discriminatory reason was not\nthe actual reason and that the employer intentionally\ndiscriminated against the employee on the basis of” a\nprohibited characteristic? Id. We have since invoked Brady\nin the context of a reverse-discrimination claim. See Ginger\nv. District of Columbia, 527 F.3d 1340, 1344 (D.C. Cir.\n2008).\n\n     We have not, however, specifically applied Brady in the\ncontext of a reverse-discrimination suit challenging the\nvalidity of an employer’s affirmative action plan under Title\nVII. In that domain, Johnson has long set forth the governing\napproach. Because no party on appeal argues that Brady\n\f                               22\nshould alter that framework, and because the existence of a\nprima facie case is readily resolved in this case in Shea’s\nfavor, we leave for another day the resolution of the\ninteraction between Brady and Johnson. We therefore\nproceed on the assumption that Johnson’s framework—\nincluding its call for examining the establishment of a prima\nfacie case—is controlling for our purposes.\n\n     Here, the State Department contests Shea’s establishment\nof a prima facie case in only one respect. As part of the\nshowing necessary to make out a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination (or reverse discrimination) in violation of Title\nVII, a plaintiff must establish that he has been subjected to an\nadverse employment action. George v. Leavitt, 407 F.3d 405,\n412 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The Department argues on appeal, for\nthe first time in this case’s long history, that Shea suffered no\nadverse employment action from his hiring at an entry-level\n(rather than mid-level) position because he never applied for\ndirect mid-level placement, either through the 1990-92 Plan\nor through the race-neutral CCP. We do not reach the merits\nof that argument because the Department forfeited it by\nfailing to raise it until this late stage.\n\n     Although “we may affirm a judgment on any ground that\nthe record supports and that the opposing party had a fair\nopportunity to address,” Jones v. Bernanke, 557 F.3d 670, 676\n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (internal citation and quotation marks\nomitted), an argument “never made below is waived on\nappeal,” id. (citing Marymount Hosp., Inc. v. Shalala, 19 F.3d\n658 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). The Department at no point in the\nprevious fourteen years of litigating this case contended that\nShea’s failure to apply for a mid-level position could affect\nhis establishment of a prima facie case. It has instead fought\nShea’s prima facie showing on other grounds. “[A]bsent\nexceptional circumstances not present here, it is not our\n\f                               23\npractice to entertain issues first raised on appeal.”\nMarymount Hosp., 19 F.3d at 663 (quoting Roosevelt v. E.I.\nDu Pont de Nemours & Co., 958 F.2d 416, 419 & n.5 (D.C.\nCir. 1992)) (quotation marks omitted). We adhere to that\npractice today. Because the Department has forfeited any\nargument that Shea suffered no adverse employment action,\nand because the Department otherwise does not challenge his\nestablishment of a prima facie case on appeal, we agree with\nthe district court that Shea has made that showing.\n\n                               B.\n\n     At the second step of Johnson’s framework, the\nDepartment must “articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for\nits decision.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Johnson observes\nthat “[t]he existence of an affirmative action plan provides\nsuch a rationale.” Id. We do not understand Johnson to\nmean, however, that an employer establishes a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for its decision merely by showing\nthat it acted pursuant to an affirmative action plan. See Hill v.\nRoss, 183 F.3d 586, 590 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Rather, the Johnson framework maps onto McDonnell\nDouglas’s three steps. Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626-27. To\nsatisfy its burden of production at the second McDonnell\nDouglas step, the State Department must “introduce evidence\nwhich, taken as true, would permit the conclusion that there\nwas a nondiscriminatory reason for” its actions. St. Mary’s\nHonor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 509 (1993) (emphasis\nomitted). And while a valid affirmative action plan is\nconsidered nondiscriminatory, see Parker v. Balt. & Ohio\nR.R. Co., 652 F.2d 1012, 1017 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1981), an invalid\naffirmative action plan is discriminatory, see Taxman, 91 F.3d\nat 1567. As a result, the Department needs to produce\n“evidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion”\n\f                               24\nthat it acted for a “nondiscriminatory reason,” i.e., pursuant to\na valid affirmative action plan. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 509\n(emphasis omitted); see Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 33-34.\n\n     We have explained that, under Johnson and Weber, a\nvalid affirmative action plan should satisfy two general\nconditions. First, a valid plan rests on an adequate factual\npredicate justifying its adoption, such as a “manifest\nimbalance” in a “traditionally segregated job categor[y].”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 631; see Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 74-75.\nSecond, a valid plan refrains from “unnecessarily\ntrammel[ing] the rights of [white] employees.” Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 637-38; see Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 81. We take up\nthose considerations in order.\n\n                               1.\n\n    The district court concluded that the Department\nadequately grounded its 1990-92 Plan in evidence of a\nmanifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category.\nSee Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 34-39.                We agree.\n\n                               a.\n\n     Ascertaining the existence of a “manifest imbalance” is a\n“fact-specific task” in a “sensitive and delicate area.”\nHammon II, 826 F.2d at 75. One method that may be used to\ndemonstrate such an imbalance—and the one relied on by the\nState Department here—entails a showing of statistical\ndisparities between the racial makeup of the employer’s\nworkforce and that of a “comparator population.” If the\npositions in question “require no special expertise,” the\ncomparator population would be “‘the area labor market or\ngeneral population.’” Id. (citation omitted) (quoting Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 632). But for “jobs that require special training,”\n\f                              25\nthe ‘“comparison should be with those in the labor force who\npossess the relevant qualifications.’” Id. (citation omitted)\n(quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632).\n\n    When the Department adopted the 1990-92 Plan, the\nagency had before it two analyses comparing its own\nworkforce with the labor pool possessing the relevant\nqualifications: (i) the 1989 GAO Report, and (ii) a formal\nanalysis conducted by the Department itself when\npromulgating the 1990-92 Plan. The Department points to\nthose two statistical studies as its principal evidence of a\nmanifest imbalance between minority representation in the\nForeign Service and the comparator population.\n\n     Shea contends that the Department cannot rely on either\nof those studies. He argues that the 1990-92 Plan amounted\nonly to a continuation of a preexisting affirmative action plan\nin place from 1987-89, and that the 1990-92 Plan thus was\nactually adopted in 1987. Shea submits that any data on\nwhich the Department purports to justify any affirmative\naction plan must have been in its possession when it\npromulgated the plan—which, by Shea’s account, would have\nbeen in 1987, before either the 1989 GAO Report or the 1990-\n92 Plan’s analysis. Consequently, Shea argues, the State\nDepartment is foreclosed from invoking either study as a\njustification for its actions.\n\n     We assume arguendo the correctness of Shea’s premise\nthat the Department cannot justify its race-conscious actions\nby reference to post hoc data collection. Even so, Shea errs in\ncontending that the Department cannot rely on the 1989 GAO\nReport or the findings contained in the 1990-92 Plan to justify\nthe Plan. The district court concluded that the Department’s\n1987-89 affirmative action efforts and the 1990-92 Plan in\nfact were two different plans. See Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at\n\f                              26\n30. We would tend to agree. But even if otherwise, the 1990-\n92 Plan at the very least amounted to a review and overhaul of\nthe Department’s affirmative action efforts. See, e.g., U.S.\nDep’t of State, Multi-Year Plan, FY 1990-92 at 51 (rev.\nversion Apr. 30, 1991) (1990-92 Plan Document) (assembling\nnew diversity statistics for purposes of the 1990-92 Plan); id.\nat 61 (noting that the 1987-89 plan “has been refined . . . to\ndefine better the type of candidate to be recruited” (emphasis\nadded)). “When a program that has been reauthorized is\nchallenged, all evidence available to the [decisionmaker] prior\nto reauthorization must be considered in assessing” the\nprogram’s legality. Rothe Dev. Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def.,\n262 F.3d 1306, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Accordingly, even if\nthe 1990-92 Plan amounted to a reauthorization of the\nDepartment’s 1987-89 affirmative action efforts, and even if\nthe Department cannot justify its actions based on post hoc\ndata, the 1989 GAO Report and the findings contained in the\n1990-92 Plan are a proper evidentiary proffer.\n\n     The version of the 1990-92 Plan in our record contains\nthe Department’s employment data from 1989 and 1990. As\nthe 1989 data represent the data in the State Department’s\npossession both at the time it promulgated the 1990-92 Plan\nand at the time Shea applied to the Foreign Service, we use\nthat data (though we note that the minor differences between\nthe 1989 and 1990 data would have no impact on our\nconclusions today). The 1990-92 Plan’s findings showed\nimprovement in the Foreign Service’s diversity from the time\nof the 1989 GAO Report. The combined FS-02 and -03\nlevels, for instance, showed underrepresentation only for\nNative Americans and Alaskans.           See 1990-92 Plan\nDocument at 46a; 47a. For other minority populations at the\ncombined FS-02 and -03 positions, there were no imbalances,\nmanifest or otherwise. As a result, Shea contends, the\nDepartment cannot justify the 1990-92 Plan by claiming that\n\f                              27\nit addressed manifest imbalances for all minority groups at\nthose levels.\n\n     The Department initially asserts that the 1990-92 Plan\nestablished “goals” only for groups specifically shown in the\ndata to be underrepresented. We take this to mean, for\nexample, that, at the combined FS-02 and -03 levels, “goals”\nwould have been set only for Native Americans and Alaskans,\nand not for other minority populations. If the “goals”\noperated such that only members of the underrepresented\nminority groups received favorable treatment in the\napplication process relative to Shea, the Department’s\nargument would have force. But the Department provides no\ninformation about how the “goals” would have worked in\npractice. And we find no description in the record. All that\nwe can glean from the record is that all minority applicants\nreceived the main benefit available under the 1990-92 Plan—\nwaiver of the certificate-of-need requirement for entry into the\nFS-01, -02, and -03 levels.\n\n     The Department’s defense of the 1990-92 Plan stands on\nstronger footing, however, with regard to more senior-level\npositions. Looking up the ranks from the FS-02 and -03\nlevels, the Department identified a more across-the-board\nmanifest imbalance. The Department first points to the FS-01\nlevel. According to the 1990-92 Plan data, all minority\ngroups were underrepresented at the FS-01 level at the time of\nthe plan’s promulgation. To achieve full representation, the\nnumber of black Officers at that level would have needed to\nincrease by 62%, Hispanics by 14%, Native Americans and\nAlaskans by 256%, and Asians and Pacific Islanders by 47%.\nSee 1990-92 Plan Document at 46a; 47a.\n\n    The Department also points to the ranks of the SFS. The\n1990-92 Plan, so far as we can tell, contains no specific data\n\f                             28\non diversity in the SFS. Accordingly, we look to the SFS\nfindings from the 1989 GAO Report. Those findings show\nunderrepresentation of all minority groups at the SFS level.\nAnd the imbalances are manifest:            To achieve full\nrepresentation, the number of black Officers in the SFS would\nhave needed to increase by 154%, Hispanics by 163%, Asians\nand Pacific Islanders by 700%, and, for Native Americans and\nAlaskans, by an undefined percentage (because the Foreign\nService had no SFS Officer of Native American or Alaskan\norigin). See 1989 GAO Report at 17.\n\n                              b.\n\n     Johnson speaks in terms not just of any manifest\nimbalance, but of a manifest imbalance in a traditionally\nsegregated job category. 480 U.S. at 631. As the Court\nexplained, the “requirement that the manifest imbalance relate\nto a traditionally segregated job category provides\nassurance” that “race will be taken into account in a manner\nconsistent with Title VII’s purpose of eliminating the effects\nof employment discrimination.” Id. at 632 (quotation marks\nomitted). That approach guards against licensing an employer\nto seek proportional representation purely for its own sake.\nThe Department must make a showing that, if taken as true,\nwould permit the conclusion that the manifest imbalance\nresulted from a “predicate of discrimination” rather than from\nbenign forces. Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 74-75, 80-81. We\nfind that the Department has done so.\n\n     First, the substantial imbalances at the SFS level\nthemselves indicate that discriminatory practices may well\nhave been afoot. While a significant disparity is not itself\ndispositive, “ranks [that are] overwhelming[ly] white” are “a\npowerful present-day demonstration of a prior regime of\ndiscrimination.” Hammon v. Barry (Hammon I), 813 F.2d\n\f                               29\n412, 427 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (referring to Weber). Here, the\ndisparity between white and non-white SFS Officers qualifies\nas overwhelming. Of the 655 serving SFS Officers counted\nby the 1989 GAO Report, 631 were white. See 1989 GAO\nReport at 17. “[F]ine tuning of the[se] statistics could not\nhave obscured the glaring absence of minority” officers. Int’l\nBhd. of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 342 n.23\n(1977).\n\n     Second, testimony before Congress concerning the 1989\nGAO Report, the Bremer Study Group Report, and the\nThomas Commission Report provided Congress with\nevidence of pervasive historical discrimination in the Foreign\nService tracing as far back as the 1960s. For example, one\nwitness testified that, when he “entered on duty in State in late\n1965 . . . [he] had [his] first experience with discrimination,\naside from what [he] had experienced while stationed in the\nSouth,” and further noted that “[m]inorities have been\nunderrepresented purposefully” within the Department. 1989\nSubcomm. Hearing at 33, 39. Another witness, focusing on\ngender discrimination at the Department, explained that,\nwhile “[i]nstances of blatant sexism and discrimination have\ndeclined, . . . some do still take place,” and “a simple glance\nat the statistics contained in the [1989 GAO Report] . . . will\nconfirm the continued existence of a problem.” Id. at 42. The\nformer EEOC Commissioner offered his assessment that\n“[t]he State Department wants to hire what I call the mythical\nAmerican, the 5’10,” 160 pound WASP man in perfect\nphysical and mental health.” J.A. 342. And the Department’s\nDeputy Assistant for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights\nprovided testimony that, around the world, he had\n“encountered complaints of discrimination from [State’s]\nemployees and criticisms from foreigners for that same\ndiscrimination as exhibited by our predominantly white male\ndiplomatic corps.” Id. at 13.\n\f                              30\n\n     To the House Subcommittee on the Civil Service, such\ntestimony likely came as no surprise. While the record before\nus does not contain the underlying materials, Representative\nSikorski, the Subcommittee Chairman, stated his belief that\nthose reports confirmed a State Department inadequately\nconcerned with diversity.       Previous investigations and\nhearings by his subcommittee, he stated, “documented serious\ninstances of discriminatory treatment by the Foreign Service\nof women, minorities, and people with handicaps.” 1989\nJoint Hearing at 10. His testimony included the revelation\nthat “more than 240 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)\ncases” had been filed and indications that previous efforts to\ndiversify the Foreign Service championed by the Secretary of\nState were “largely ignored by the Department.”            Id.\nMoreover, he noted, the Department had “been repeatedly\ncited by the [EEOC] for submitting deficient [diversity]\nreports.” Id. The 1989 GAO Report noted that, despite\nrepeated criticism including suggestions of bias, the State\nDepartment never “conducted analyses of possible\nimpediments to equal employment opportunity.” 1989 GAO\nReport at 4.\n\n     This case is therefore a far cry from our decisions in\nHammon I and II, in which we determined that the District of\nColumbia had failed to demonstrate the predicate of\ndiscrimination necessary to justify an affirmative action\nprogram for its hiring of firefighters. The challenged plan\npurportedly addressed the District’s history of discriminatory\nhiring against black applicants. But during the relevant\nhistorical period, blacks made up an average of 41.8% of the\nfirefighters hired each year, Hammon I, 813 F.2d at 427, and,\nat the time of the challenge, 37% of the firefighting workforce\noverall, Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 77. The proper comparator\npool was 29.3% black. Hammon I, 813 F.2d at 428. In light\n\f                             31\nof those figures, the District “steadfastly and persuasively\nprotested its innocence of any discriminatory activity,” and\nwe agreed. Id. at 427.\n\n     Here, by contrast, evidence identified by the Department\nwould permit the conclusion that there had been a past\npractice of discrimination with continuing effects through the\nearly 1990s. We therefore agree with the district court that\nthe Department made an adequate evidentiary proffer that the\n1990-92 Plan “served to remedy the lingering effects of\nState’s past discrimination.” Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 39.\n\n                              2.\n\n     Having shown the necessary factual predicate for the\n1990-92 Plan in the form of a manifest imbalance in a\ntraditionally segregated job category, the Department faces\none additional requirement:       The plan must not have\nunnecessarily trammeled the rights of white applicants.\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 637-38; Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 81.\nWe, like the district court, conclude that the Department has\nmade an adequate showing in this regard.\n\n                              a.\n\n     There is “no precise formula for determining whether an\naffirmative action plan unnecessarily trammels the rights of\nnon-beneficiaries.”        In   re    Birmingham    Reverse\nDiscrimination Emp’t Litig., 20 F.3d at 1541. Rather, a\nnumber of considerations inform the inquiry. See Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 637-40; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208-09; Hammon II,\n826 F.2d at 81. Those considerations weigh in favor of the\n1990-92 Plan’s validity.\n\f                                32\n     First, the type of affirmative action plan matters.\nAffirmative action in hiring generally poses less of a concern\nthan affirmative action in layoffs. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n638. Hiring decisions upset settled expectations to a lesser\ndegree (because an applicant has no absolute entitlement to a\njob), and they affect a more diffuse group (all potential\napplicants) than do layoffs, which target specific employees.\nSee United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149, 183 (1987)\n(plurality opinion) (“Denial of a future employment\nopportunity . . . is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job.”)\n(quotation marks omitted); cf. Firefighters Local Union No.\n1784 v. Stotts, 467 U.S. 561, 578-79 (1984). Here, the 1990-\n92 Plan awarded benefits to minority candidates only in the\nhiring process, and even then, only at the very initial stage.\n\n     Second, the degree of benefit, or “plus,” bestowed by the\naffirmative action plan can make a difference. Affirmative\naction resulting in the hiring only of qualified candidates\nmore easily survives scrutiny than affirmative action resulting\nin the hiring of unqualified beneficiaries. See Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 637-38. In this case, the Department’s 1990-92 Plan\nprovided for hiring only of qualified candidates: Minority\napplicants considered through the 1990-92 Plan underwent\nthe same rigorous application path as did white candidates\nconsidered through the race-neutral CCP, with the only\ndifference coming in the form of the certificate-of-need\nwaiver at the threshold.\n\n    Third, the goals of the affirmative action plan affect the\ninquiry. A plan that seeks to achieve full representation for\nthe particular purpose of remedying past discrimination will\ngenerally be shorter in duration than one that pursues\nproportional diversity for its own sake. When a plan pursues\nonly the former goal, it presumably would cease to operate\nonce full representation is achieved. And the shorter the time\n\f                              33\nperiod for which a plan is in operation, the less it could be\nsaid adversely to affect non-beneficiaries. In Weber, for\ninstance, the Court approvingly observed that the plan it\nupheld was “not intended to maintain racial balance, but\nsimply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance.” 443 U.S. at\n208; see Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639-40. Here, the 1990-92 Plan\nsought to attain more proportional representation, not to\nmaintain it in perpetuity. Indeed, the 1990-92 Plan ceased to\noperate in 1993 and has not been replaced. Shea, 961 F.\nSupp. 2d at 41-42.\n\n     Fourth, the extent to which the challenged plan limits\nopportunities for advancement by non-beneficiaries is a\nrelevant consideration. In both Johnson and Weber, the Court\nobserved that the plan in question created no “absolute bar” to\nthe advancement of non-beneficiaries. Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n637-38; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. Here, Shea makes no\nargument that the 1990-92 Plan engendered any “absolute\nbar” to the advancement of non-minorities in the Foreign\nService ranks. Non-minority candidates from outside the\nagency could apply directly to the mid-level ranks through the\nrace-neutral CCP, and internal white candidates could—and\ndid—gain promotion to mid-level positions from the Foreign\nService entry-level ranks.\n\n                               b.\n\n    Our court has understood the need to avoid\n“unnecessarily” trammeling the rights of non-minority\ncandidates to indicate that a challenged affirmative action\nplan generally must be “tailored to fit the violation” sought to\nbe addressed. Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 74; see id. at 81. Here,\nthe 1990-92 Plan granted a certificate-of-need waiver to\ncandidates applying to the FS-01, -02, and -03 levels. The\nDepartment’s identified manifest imbalances, however,\n\f                              34\noccurred at only the more senior levels. Why bestow benefits\nat the FS-02 and -03 levels if the manifest imbalances sought\nto be addressed existed only at more senior positions? To do\nso, Shea contends, means that the 1990-92 Plan was so over-\ninclusive as to unnecessarily trammel the rights of white\napplicants at the FS-02 and -03 levels.\n\n     The Department submits that there is a sound explanation\nfor targeting the FS-02 and -03 levels to address an imbalance\nat more senior levels. The 1990-92 Plan satisfies the tailoring\nrequirement, the Department explains, because the FS-02 and\n-03 levels serve as the training grounds for learning the skills\nnecessary to perform at the SFS and FS-01 levels. We agree.\n\n     The plan upheld in Weber is instructive. The employer in\nWeber aimed to remedy the manifest imbalance in its ranks of\nskilled workers: a mere 1.83% of its skilled workers were\nblack, while the labor force in the surrounding area was 39%\nblack. 443 U.S. at 198-99. To address the identified\nimbalance in its skilled workforce, however, the employer\ncould not simply hire laborers lacking the requisite skills.\nRather, it needed to hire laborers after they had acquired those\nskills. The employer established a training program to tackle\nthat problem, stipulating that 50% of all employees entering\nthe training program would be black until the percentage of\nblack skilled workers in its workforce approximated the\npercentage in the local labor force. See id. at 199.\n\n     Weber thus provides an example of an affirmative action\nplan going beyond strictly proportional representation in a\ntraining program: 50% of the spots would go to the\ncompany’s black workers, even though black persons made\nup only 39% of the area labor force. Employees who had\ncompleted Weber’s training program could then proceed to\nthe rank of skilled worker, where the manifest imbalance\n\f                                35\nexisted. The need to create an adequate pipeline of trained\nworkers meant that the program was sufficiently tailored to\ntarget the “manifest imbalance” among skilled workers.\n\n    The State Department’s 1990-92 Plan worked similarly.\nIn order to attain full representation at the SFS and FS-01\nlevels, the Department maintains, it had to go beyond strictly\nproportional minority representation at the FS-02 and -03\nlevels.    It could then choose from qualified minority\ncandidates at those levels to staff its SFS and FS-01 ranks.\n\n     With regard to the SFS, the Department’s hiring\nregulations in place at the time of the 1990-92 Plan\ndemonstrate that the Department valued a certain set of skills\nin its SFS Officers and believed that the best way for SFS\ncandidates to gain those experiences was through service in\nthe mid-level Foreign Service ranks.             The regulations\nprovided that career SFS Officers “normally shall be\nappointed as the result of promotion of Mid-Level career\nofficers,” and generally limited the SFS to a maximum of five\npercent external hires at any given time. Appointment of\nMembers of the Foreign Service, 48 Fed. Reg. 38,606, 38,607\n(Aug. 25, 1983).        Additionally, career SFS applicants\ngenerally had to have completed at least five years of service\nin a position “of responsibility . . . equivalent to that of a Mid-\nLevel Foreign Service officer (classes FS-1 through FS-3),”\nwith “duties and responsibilities . . . similar to or closely\nrelated to that of a Foreign Service officer in terms of\nknowledge, skills, abilities, and overseas work experience.”\nId. The difficulties encountered by those directly promoted to\na mid- or high-level position in the Foreign Service, which\nusually included a “prolonged adjustment period” and\nexperiencing “a competitive disadvantage,” further suggest\nthat percolating through the ranks was, generally, a sounder\ncareer path.\n\f                               36\n\n     The conclusion from the then-existing regulations is\nstraightforward: The Department believed that the best\ntraining for the role of a SFS Officer was experience as an FS-\n01, -02, or -03 Foreign Service Officer. The Department\nsimilarly valued skills gleaned from experience at the FS-02\nand -03 ranks for the position of an FS-01, with outside hires\ninto the FS-01 ranks serving as the small exception to the\nDepartment’s general internal promotion ladder. See J.A.\n343, 516-17. Shea has introduced no evidence contradicting\nthat understanding.\n\n     In view of the Department’s assessment that the most\nqualified candidates for the SFS and FS-01 ranks would come\nfrom its own mid-levels, the Department understandably saw\na need to go further than strictly proportional representation in\nits mid-levels.      That was necessary, the Department\nreasonably concluded, in order to have a sufficient reservoir\nof talented minority candidates from which to hire in order to\nachieve diversity in its SFS and FS-01 ranks. Otherwise,\nassuming that promotion rates were the same across races\nfrom the mid-levels to the SFS and FS-01 levels, the\nDepartment would need to await a great deal of turnover in\nthe overwhelmingly white SFS and FS-01 ranks before the\nsubstantial imbalances at those levels would be rectified.\n\n    Congressional testimony on the 1989 GAO Report\nreveals that very concern. Joseph Kelley of the General\nAccounting Office, in response to questioning about when\n“the State Department [would] become representative of the\nAmerican people,” told Congress that “[i]t is going to take a\nlong time,” and noted that the EEOC had been pushing the\nDepartment “to have a program to move people around and to\nhave upper-level promotions, but it ha[d]n’t worked out that\nwell.” 1989 Subcomm. Hearing at 29-30. The Department\n\f                              37\nrequired a method by which to augment the flow of minority\ncandidates to the SFS and FS-01 levels. As Representative\nSikorski observed, “if the numbers [only] get[] better\nin . . . entry level and hiring,” then “there is no upward\nprogress. There is no flow in the right direction. We are\ntalking centuries.” Id. at 29-30.\n\n     It is no answer to claim that the Department could simply\npromote minorities to the SFS and FS-01 levels at higher rates\nthan their non-minority peers. That itself would have been a\nrace-conscious action requiring justification. That option, at\nany rate, appears to have been non-viable. Testimony before\nCongress indicated that promotions of minorities to high-level\npositions were already happening “too fast,” such that the\nDepartment began “to get a backlash” that promotions were\n“not [of] qualified . . . minorities” and that those promoted\nwere “not really ready to make this jump.” Id. at 47. Title\nVII does not require the Department to promote unqualified\ncandidates to execute the important mission of our diplomatic\ncorps. For those reasons, the 1990-92 Plan’s emphasis on\nhiring at mid-level positions was adequately tailored to\naddress manifest imbalances at the senior levels.\n\n     At its root, finally, the unnecessary trammeling inquiry\namounts to an exercise in balancing a plan’s attempts to\nremedy past discrimination against the plan’s adverse impact\non the rights of non-minorities. In this case, the latter impact\nwas unquestionably limited. The 1989 GAO Report indicates\nthat the State Department had 655 SFS Officers, 836 FS-01\nOfficers, and 2,032 FS-02 or -03 Officers. 1989 GAO Report\nat 17. Against that backdrop, the Department informs us that\nonly sixteen minority candidates were hired into the mid-\nlevels through the 1990-92 Plan over the three calendar years\nof its operation. With such a modest effect on the hiring\nprocess, the 1990-92 Plan was necessarily limited in the\n\f                              38\nextent to which it could            “trammel”   Shea’s   rights,\n“unnecessarily” or otherwise.\n\n                               c.\n\n     The tailoring inquiry, according to our decisions, also\ntakes into account whether the employer considered race-\nneutral alternatives. See Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 81. While\nthe program we considered in Hammon failed to pass muster\nbecause “reasonable alternatives were not seriously\ndiscussed,” Hammon I, 813 F.2d at 430, the district court in\nthis case found the Department’s evidence to show that it\nturned to the 1990-92 Plan’s race-conscious measures only\nafter race-neutral efforts failed to bear fruit. Shea, 961 F.\nSupp. 2d at 40-41. We agree.\n\n     The record documents a number of previous attempts to\ncorrect the identified imbalances without resort to explicit\nracial preferences, particularly through recruiting and\noutreach. From 1964 on, the Department targeted historically\nblack institutions as part of its “diplomat in residence”\nprogram, through which it assigned a senior-level Foreign\nService Officer to research, writing, and teaching duties at a\nuniversity in an effort to generate interest in the Foreign\nService among students. 1989 GAO Report at 24. From\n1980 on, the Department made a concentrated recruiting push\nto stimulate an increase in minority applicants, including by\n“provid[ing] information packages to colleges . . . and\nask[ing] college coordinators to encourage minorities . . . to\ntake the annual written [Foreign Service] examination.” Id. at\n22-23. The Department’s recruiters made special efforts to\nvisit colleges and universities with large minority enrollments.\nId. at 23. Ultimately, however, the Department concluded\nthat its “recruiting efforts [did] not increase[] the number of\nminorities taking the FS examination for officer positions.”\n\f                               39\nId. And in 1986, the Secretary of State implemented a\nrecommendation from black Foreign Service Officers aimed\nat elevating minority written exam pass rates by increasing\nminority enrollment in university courses relevant to the\nexam. That initiative, too, apparently proved unsatisfactory.\nSee id. at 25.\n\n     The Department also instituted “sensitivity training”\nbetween “senior management” and “senior minorities” to\naddress the gap, with little success. J.A. 369-70. Moreover, it\nconsidered implementing an entirely race-neutral mid-level\nentry program, but rejected that option as unlikely to be\neffective—an understandable conclusion in light of the\ninadequacy of State’s earlier reliance on “the promotion of\nentry level FS officers to eliminate underrepresentation at\nmore senior levels.” J.A. 301, 543. The 1990-92 Plan thus\nhardly constituted the Department’s maiden effort to solve its\npersistent diversity problem, and Shea points to no other race-\nneutral alternatives that should have been considered.\n\n     The Department, in short, has introduced evidence that\nthe 1990-92 Plan worked to target manifest imbalances in\nsenior-level positions in the Foreign Service Officer corps,\nand that those imbalances resulted from past discrimination.\nIt has also introduced evidence that the Plan refrained from\nunnecessarily trammeling the rights of non-minority\ncandidates. We therefore conclude that the Department\nsatisfies its burden to introduce evidence that, if taken as true,\ndemonstrates the 1990-92 Plan’s validity under Johnson and\nWeber.\n\n                               V.\n\n    Having concluded that the Department met its burden of\nproduction at the second step of the Johnson-McDonnell\n\f                              40\nDouglas framework, we ask at the final step whether Shea has\nproven that the Department’s “justification is pretextual and\nthe plan is invalid.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. In the district\ncourt, Shea introduced his own lay statistical evidence in an\nattempt to show that the Department’s identified manifest\nimbalances did not exist. See Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 45-53.\nThe district court rejected every piece of statistical evidence\nproffered by Shea as inadmissible. See id. Shea does not\nappeal those findings, and he raises no other claims of the\n1990-92 Plan’s invalidity for purposes of Johnson’s third\nstep. He therefore necessarily fails to carry his burden at that\nstep, warranting the entry of summary judgment in favor of\nthe Department.\n\n                      *   *    *   *    *\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment.\n                                                So ordered.\n\f     WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring: I join the\ncourt’s opinion painstakingly applying the key Supreme Court\ncases, Johnson v. Transp. Agency, Santa Clara Cnty., 480\nU.S. 616 (1987), and United Steelworkers v. Weber, 443 U.S.\n193 (1979). I write separately to note that this area of the law\ncontinues to be rather amorphous and to call attention to a\nstatistical problem disclosed by the record but not raised by\nthe plaintiff on appeal.\n\n     Nearly three decades ago Judge Silberman observed that\nhe was “uncertain as to the meaning of ‘manifest imbalance.’”\nHammon v. Barry, 826 F.2d 73, 81 (D.C. Cir. 1987)\n(Silberman, J., concurring in denial of rehearing). I fully\nshare that uncertainty, and would add that I have the same\nreaction to all of the key terms prescribed by the Supreme\nCourt for assessing affirmative action plans under Title VII:\nwhether there has been “manifest imbalance” in a\n“traditionally segregated job category,” and whether the plan\n“unnecessarily trammels the rights” of the persons disfavored.\nCourt Op., 24. It may be that the Supreme Court selected\nthese terms to assure that, without saying it in so many words,\nan employer can use race and gender for hiring or promoting\nminorities or women to the extent appropriate to assure that\nthere is no “underrepresentation”—i.e., to amend any non-\ntrivial deviation from proportionality to some more or less\nplausible applicant pool (at least so long as the employer can\nmuster vague, generalized and/or hearsay assertions of past\ndiscrimination). This is not a self-evident interpretation of\nTitle VII’s directive that employers are not “to discriminate\nagainst any individual . . . because of such individual’s race\n[or] sex.”\n\n     The effect is especially striking here: Shea neither\nchallenged the district court’s ruling that his analysis of the\nState Department’s calculations was inadmissible, Court Op.\n40, nor its ruling that the affirmative action plan’s repeated\n\f                                2\n\ndeclarations of “manifest imbalance” were sufficient without\nexpert provision of statistical support. See Shea v. Kerry, 961\nF. Supp. 2d 17, 51-52 (D.D.C. 2013).                 The figures\nunderpinning State’s plan consist mainly of numerical\ncomparisons of various subgroups of Foreign Service\nemployees (“Administrative,” “Professional,” “Clerical,” etc.)\nwith a selected comparison group based on the “National\nCivilian Labor Force” data for various types of workers, e.g.,\n“Public Administration Administrators and Officials.” Joint\nAppendix (“J.A.”) 209, 216. The description of the study in\nthe record, J.A. 209, does not state what statistical test or\nstandard of statistical significance the authors used, or indeed\nwhether they used any statistical method at all. Certainly they\ndo not suggest that they made an adjustment in the standard\nfor statistical significance to account for the multiplicity of\nsubgroups, as would be necessary if we assume that State was\nseeking to identify only “imbalances” not attributable to\nrandom chance. “When interpreting . . . a table which\nsummarizes results from a number of comparisons, one must\nbear in mind that when the number of comparisons is large\n[State’s report included hundreds], the probability may be\nsubstantial that at least one disparity with a P-value less than\n.05 will occur because of pure chance.” David C. Baldus &\nJames W. L. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination § 9.03\n(Supp. 1987); see also id. at n.24a (“It is a mathematical fact\nthat where 17 independent comparisons are to be tested, the\nprobability of finding one or more to be statistically\nsignificant at the .05 level is .58, or almost 6 chances in 10.”).\n\n     Further impairing the value of the analysis is that many of\nthe subsets are so small as to indicate a complete lack of\nintelligible criteria for State’s assertions of “manifest\nimbalance,” a term the report often uses but never explains.\nThe report contains charts that split the workforce three ways\n(by occupational subgroup, ethnicity, and gender), and in one\ncase it announces that it “reveals” a “manifest imbalance” of\n\f                               3\n\nAmerican Indian females (who represent 0.2% of the labor\nforce comparison data) in the Finance Officer division, which\nemploys only 125 people. J.A. 224-25. It seems improbable\nthat any statistical test or standard of significance could yield\nevidence of a non-random “imbalance” for so small a\nsubgroup. To the extent the report is suggesting that some\npurported “imbalances” could be amended by the hiring of a\nsingle employee of the right ethnicity and gender in the\noccupational unit in question, that response would, in turn,\npresumably create “imbalance” in another direction—thus\nappearing to undermine whatever criteria may have been used\nto define “manifest imbalance.” See, e.g., J.A. 218-19; 224-\n25. I recognize that Johnson is quite specific in stating that\nthe proof of imbalance needed as a prerequisite for race- and\ngender-based affirmative action preferences is less than what\nis needed to establish a prima facie case of a Title VII\nviolation, 480 U.S. at 632-33, but an employer performing this\nexercise should at least be able to state its criteria for\n“manifest imbalance.”\n\n     The State Department in this respect sounds rather like\nthe defendant university in Hill v. Ross, 183 F.3d 586, 591\n(7th Cir. 1999): “What the University appears to have in\nmind is a world in which the absence of discrimination means\nthat every department would exactly mirror the population\nfrom which its members are hired. But that is statistical\nnonsense.” In Hill, Judge Easterbrook went on to explain in\ndetail what made the university’s theories nonsensical.\nWithout close attention, Johnson’s seeming license to pursue\nproportionality in a workforce can dissolve into a license to\npursue proportionality in almost any subset of the workforce.\n\f",

Cir. 2006).       Foreign Service Officers “perform\ntraditional diplomatic responsibilities, including trade\npromotion, political and economic reporting, and consular\nservices and protection.” Id.\n\n     In 1990, Shea applied for an entry-level Foreign Service\nOfficer position. At the time, the Foreign Service career\nladder consisted of six pay grades, ranging from FS-06 (entry\nlevel) to FS-01 (upper level), with the Senior Foreign Service\n(SFS) a step above FS-01. The Department generally filled\nvacancies at more senior ranks through internal promotions\nrather than external hires. Applicants from outside the agency\nthus ordinarily entered the Officer corps only at the junior\nlevels (FS-04, -05 and -06 levels). In May 1992, Shea joined\nthe Foreign Service at the FS-05 level.\n\n                             B.\n\n     In the years preceding Shea’s application to the Foreign\nService, the State Department faced significant scrutiny about\nthe lack of diversity of the Foreign Service Officer corps. In\n1985, Congress perceived an underrepresentation of\nminorities among Foreign Service Officers.           Congress\ntherefore enacted legislation directing the Department to\n“develop . . . a plan designed to increase significantly the\nnumber of members of minority groups . . . in the Foreign\nService,” with a “particular emphasis on achieving significant\nincreases in the numbers of minority group members . . . in\nthe mid-levels of the Foreign Service,” the FS-02 and -03\nlevels. Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years\n1986 and 1987, Pub. L. No. 99-93, § 152(a), (b), 99 Stat. 405,\n428 (1985).\n\f                                4\n     Two years later, Congress remained unsatisfied.\nConcluding that the State Department “ha[d] not been\nsuccessful in [its] efforts . . . to recruit and retain members of\nminority groups,” Congress instructed the Department to\n“substantially increase [its] efforts” to ensure that the\n“Foreign Service becomes truly representative of the\nAmerican people throughout all levels of the Foreign\nService.” Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years\n1988 and 1989, Pub. L. No. 100-204, § 183(a), (a)(1), (b)(1),\n101 Stat. 1331, 1364 (1987). Congress specifically directed\nthe Department to “ensure that those [efforts] effectively\naddress the need to promote increased numbers of\nqualified . . . members of minority groups into the senior\nlevels of the Foreign Service.” Id. § 183(b)(2).\n\n     Congress did not stand alone in raising concerns about\nthe diversity of the Foreign Service Officer corps. In 1989,\nthe General Accounting Office (now known as the\nGovernmental Accountability Office) released a report\nentitled “State Department: Minorities and Women Are\nUnderrepresented in the Foreign Service.” The 1989 GAO\nReport evaluated the Department’s existing efforts, finding\nthat, while “[p]rogress ha[d] been mixed” in increasing\ndiversity,\n\n       [m]inorities . . . were    still substantially\n       underrepresented when compared with civilian\n       labor force data that the EEOC ha[d] issued to\n       measure federal agencies. . . .\n\n        In mid-level ranks of the officer corps,\n       minority male representation ha[d] increased,\n       but minority and white women ha[d] made less\n       progress. In State’s Senior Foreign Service\n\f                              5\n       positions, underrepresentation of minorities\n       and white women [wa]s still pervasive.\n\nU.S. Gen. Accounting Office, State Department: Minorities\nand Women Are Underrepresented in the Foreign Service 15\n(1989) (1989 GAO Report).\n\n     The 1989 GAO Report compared the Department’s 1987\nminority workforce with the racial breakdown of the\nAmerican population possessing the skills required for\nForeign Service employment. That comparison indicated that\nthe Department generally fell short of “full representation”—\nthe level at which a minority group would make up the same\nproportion of the workforce as its proportion of the American\npopulation possessing the relevant skills—at mid- and senior-\nlevel Foreign Service Officer positions, as follows: for\nwomen of each defined minority group at the SFS, FS-01,\n-02, and -03 levels; black, Native American and native\nAlaskan men at the SFS level; Hispanic men at the SFS and\nFS-01 levels; and Asian and Pacific Islander men at the SFS,\nFS-01, -02, and -03 levels.\n\n    The Civil Service Subcommittee of the House Committee\non Post Office and Civil Service convened hearings focusing\non the 1989 GAO Report’s findings and on the results of two\nother studies—the Bremer Study Group Report\n(commissioned by the Secretary of State on his own initiative)\nand the Thomas Commission Report (mandated by Congress\nas part of the 1988-1989 Foreign Relations Authorization\nAct). Representative Gerry Sikorski, the Subcommittee’s\nChairman, interpreted those two studies to “disclose[] major\nproblems of discrimination against . . . minorities in the\nForeign Service.”     Underrepresentation of Women and\nMinorities in the Foreign Service: Hearing Before the\nSubcomm. on the Civil Serv. of the H. Comm. on Post Office\n\f                               6\n& Civil Serv., 101st Cong. 3 (1989) (1989 Subcomm.\nHearing).    Those studies, he concluded, revealed that\n“management of the U.S. Foreign Service [was] seriously\nflawed.” The Department of State in the 21st Century: Joint\nHearing Before the Subcomm. on Int’l Ops. of the H. Comm.\non Foreign Affairs & the Subcomm. on the Civil Serv. of the\nH. Comm. on Post Office & Civil Serv., 101st Cong. 6 (1989)\n(1989 Joint Hearing).\n\n     As of 1989, minorities remained underrepresented in\nForeign Service Officer roles. Id. And that was after years of\nconcerns voiced by Congress and repeated warnings from the\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission “that the State\nDepartment ha[d] not had an effective . . . plan or program for\novercoming the underrepresentation [of minorities] in the\nForeign Service.” U.S. Gen. Accounting Office, Testimony:\nUnderrepresentation of Minorities and Women in the Foreign\nService, Statement of Joseph Kelley, Director of Security and\nInternational Relations Issues, National Security and\nInternational Affairs Division, Before the Subcommittee on\nCivil Service, Committee on Post Office and Civil Service,\nUnited States House of Representatives 1 (1989). The\nDepartment undertook various measures in response,\nincluding creating a special hiring path for minorities into the\nForeign Service’s mid- and upper-level ranks—the\naffirmative action plan in issue here.\n\n                              C.\n\n     At the time of Shea’s entry into the Foreign Service, the\nState Department operated two distinct programs that enabled\napplicants to bypass the Department’s usual preference for\ninternal promotions and allowed the direct hiring of outside\napplicants into mid- and upper-level (FS-01, -02 and -03)\npositions. One program, the Career Candidate Program\n\f                              7\n(CCP), was race-neutral. The other program, the 1990-92\nAffirmative Action Plan (1990-92 Plan), targeted minority\napplicants.\n\n     Under the CCP, the Department accepted certain\napplications from outside candidates for FS-01, -02, and -03\npositions. But the Department, in accordance with its general\npreference for filling vacancies through internal promotions,\ncould hire an otherwise viable outside applicant through the\nCCP only if the Department issued a “certificate of need”\nattesting that no internal candidates could fill that vacancy.\nThe Department would then consider the outside applicant\nconsistent with its typical hiring procedures. In the absence\nof a certificate of need, no outside candidate could receive an\noffer of employment through the CCP.\n\n     Under the race-conscious 1990-92 Plan, the Department\nprovided a special path for minorities seeking direct\nplacement as outside hires into the FS-01, -02, and -03 ranks.\nThe 1990-92 Plan gave one—and only one—advantage to\nminority applicants: an automatic waiver of the CCP’s\ncertificate-of-need requirement for “American Indians, Alaska\nNative[s], Asians and Pacific Islanders, Blacks, and\nHispanics.” U.S. Dep’t of State, Foreign Service Mid-Level\nHiring Program Highlights 1 (1989). Apart from the\ncertificate-of-need waiver at the threshold stage, the 1990-92\nPlan granted no benefits to minorities in the course of the\nhiring process. That process was rigorous: The “vast\nmajority” of minority candidates applying through the 1990-\n92 Plan “were eliminated from competition at the preliminary\nreview stage.” Id.\n\f                                8\n                               D.\n\n     In 2001, Shea filed an administrative grievance with the\nState Department. Among other claims, he argued that he\nstarted at a lower pay grade by virtue of the 1990-92 Plan’s\npreferential treatment of minority applicants, infringing his\nrights under Title VII as well as the equal protection\ncomponent of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\nAmendment.         The Foreign Service Grievance Board\ndismissed his complaint for lack of jurisdiction, and Shea then\nfiled suit in the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia.\n\n     Shea’s case initially traveled back and forth between the\ndistrict court and this court on the question of whether his\nTitle VII and equal protection claims had been timely filed.\n(As to the remaining claims, Shea did not appeal their\ndismissal.)

Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 27-29.\n\f                                9\n     At the first step, the district court concluded that Shea\nhad established a prima facie case of discrimination in\nviolation of Title VII. Id. at 31-33. Turning to the second\nstep, the court found that the Department had proffered\nevidence that, if accepted as true, permitted the conclusion\nthat the Department had acted pursuant to a lawful affirmative\naction plan. Id. at 33-44. Finally, at the third step, the district\ncourt considered whether Shea had shown that the affirmative\naction plan was, in fact, unlawful. The court rejected Shea’s\nproffer of lay statistical evidence to that end, and thus\nconcluded that he had failed to raise any genuine issue\nconcerning the validity of the Department’s affirmative action\nplan. The court therefore granted summary judgment in favor\nof the Department. Id. at 55.\n\n                                II.\n\n     We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment on Shea’s Title VII claim. Holcomb v.

Cir. 2006). Before addressing the merits\nof that claim, we first assure ourselves of Shea’s standing to\nbring it.

In the context of an\nemployment discrimination claim, a plaintiff may claim an\ninjury in fact from the purported denial of the ability to\ncompete on an equal footing against other candidates for a\n\f                               10\njob. See Ne. Fla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors\nof Am. v. City of Jacksonville, Fla., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 666 (1993);\nCerrato v.

Because the injury lies in the denial of an equal\nopportunity to compete, not the denial of the job itself, we do\nnot inquire into the plaintiff’s qualifications (or lack thereof)\nwhen assessing standing. See Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 280-81 & n.14 (1978).\n\n    Shea alleges that the 1990-92 Plan denied him the\nopportunity to compete on an equal basis by extending a\npreference to minority candidates that was unavailable to him:\nthe ability to gain consideration for entry to a mid-level\nposition without any certificate of need. Shea could have\nsought direct mid-level placement through the race-neutral\nCCP program, however. He did not do so, instead applying\nonly for an entry-level FS-05 position. There is thus a\nquestion whether Shea suffered an actual or imminent injury\nas a result of the 1990-92 Plan, or whether his injury was\nmerely hypothetical.\n\n     The Supreme Court’s decision in Gratz v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), found the existence of standing in parallel\ncircumstances. In Gratz, one of the plaintiffs, Patrick\nHamacher, sought to challenge the University of Michigan’s\nconsideration of race in its undergraduate transfer admissions.\nAt the time of the suit, Hamacher had yet to apply to transfer\nto Michigan. Indeed, the Court’s opinion indicated that he\nwould not do so as long as Michigan’s race-conscious\nadmissions program remained in place: Hamacher instead\ndeclared that he “intend[ed] to transfer to the University of\nMichigan when [it] cease[d] the use of race as an admissions\npreference.” Id. at 261 (emphasis added). The Supreme\nCourt sua sponte questioned Hamacher’s standing to bring his\nchallenge, ultimately concluding that he had shown an injury\n\f                               11\nin fact. The Court reasoned that, because of Hamacher’s\nstated intent to transfer should Michigan change its policy, he\nhad established standing. Id. at 261-62.\n\n      Gratz controls our inquiry. Like Hamacher, Shea alleges\nthat he possessed an intent to apply to the position in question,\ni.e., a mid-level position. Pl.’s Decl. in Supp. of Pl.’s\nSurreply at 3-4 (filed Dec. 14, 2012). If the mid-levels had\nbeen open to him for equal consideration on a race-neutral\nfooting, he would have applied to the mid-levels instead of\nthe entry-level. Thus, like Hamacher, Shea stood “able and\nready to apply [to the mid-levels] should the [State\nDepartment] cease to use race” as a factor in mid-level hiring.\nId. (quotation marks omitted). By choosing not to apply\nbecause the Department was considering race during the time\nof his application process, Shea did exactly what Hamacher\nalleged he would do: refuse to apply through the race-\nconscious program unless and until that program’s use of\nrace-conscious preferences ceased.

Shea argues that those standards have been\ndisplaced by the Supreme Court’s decision in Ricci v.\nDeStefano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145848\"><a href=\"/opinion/145848/ricci-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009), such that Johnson and\nWeber no longer guide the analysis of reverse-discrimination\nclaims under Title VII. We are unpersuaded.\n\n                              1.\n\n     In Weber, the Supreme Court for the first time considered\na Title VII challenge to an employer’s affirmative action plan.\nAs of 1974, Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. had an\n“almost exclusively white craftwork force[],” with black\nemployees making up only 1.83% of the company’s skilled\ncraftworkers at its Gramercy, Louisiana, plant, even though\nthe workforce in the area surrounding that plant was roughly\n39% black. Weber, 443 U.S. at 198-99. As part of a\ncollective-bargaining agreement, Kaiser promised to\nimplement “an affirmative action plan designed to eliminate\n[that] conspicuous racial imbalance[].” Id. at 198. The\ncompany established job-training programs to teach both\nblack and white employees the necessary skills for promotion\nto craftworker positions. Id. at 198-99. Selection of trainees\nfor the program would be made on the basis of seniority, but\n“with the proviso that at least 50% of the new trainees were to\nbe black until the percentage of black skilled craftworkers in\n\f                              13\nthe Gramercy plant approximated the percentage of blacks in\nthe local labor force.” Id. at 199. A white unskilled\nproduction worker from the plant sued, arguing that Title VII\nprohibited all race-conscious employer actions. Id. at 199,\n201.\n\n     The Supreme Court disagreed and upheld Kaiser’s\naffirmative action plan. The Court declined to “define in\ndetail the line of demarcation between permissible and\nimpermissible affirmative action plans,” but concluded that\nKaiser’s plan fell “on the permissible side of the line.” Id. at\n208. The trainee-selection plan, the Court approvingly noted,\naimed to “break down old patterns of racial segregation and\nhierarchy” and “open employment opportunities for [black\nworkers] in occupations which have been traditionally closed\nto them.” Id. (quotation marks omitted). The Court set out\nthe considerations that caused it to uphold the company’s plan\nas follows:\n\n       [T]he plan does not unnecessarily trammel the\n       interests of the white employees. The plan\n       does not require the discharge of white\n       workers and their replacement with new black\n       hirees. Nor does the plan create an absolute\n       bar to the advancement of white employees;\n       half of those trained in the program will be\n       white. Moreover, the plan is a temporary\n       measure; it is not intended to maintain racial\n       balance, but simply to eliminate a manifest\n       racial imbalance. Preferential selection of craft\n       trainees at the Gramercy plant will end as soon\n       as the percentage of black skilled craftworkers\n       in the Gramercy plant approximates the\n       percentage of blacks in the local labor force.\n\f                              14\nId. at 208-09 (citation omitted). For those reasons, the plan\nfell “within the area of discretion left by Title VII to the\nprivate sector voluntarily to adopt affirmative action plans\ndesigned to eliminate conspicuous racial imbalance in\ntraditionally segregated job categories.” Id. at 209.\n\n                              2.\n\n     Nine years later, in Johnson, the Court again rejected a\nTitle VII challenge to an employer’s affirmative action\nprogram. The case arose from the efforts of Santa Clara\nCounty, California, to increase diversity in portions of its\nworkforce. The County sought to address a striking gender\nimbalance in certain positions: Women constituted 36.4% of\nthe labor market in the area, but “none of [the County’s] 238\nSkilled Craft Worker positions was held by a woman.”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 621. The County implemented a\nvoluntary affirmative action plan with a stated “long-term\ngoal” to “attain a work force whose composition reflected the\nproportion of minorities and women in the area labor force.”\nId. at 621-22.       The County’s plan “authorized the\nconsideration of ethnicity or sex as a factor when evaluating\nqualified candidates for jobs in which members of such\ngroups were poorly represented,” but it did not set aside a\nspecific number of hiring slots for women or racial minorities.\nId. at 622.\n\n     In upholding the County’s plan, the Court determined\nthat the analysis should follow the three-step burden-shifting\nframework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). Under that framework:\n\n       Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case\n       that race or sex has been taken into account in\n       an employer’s employment decision [step one],\n\f                              15\n       the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a\n       nondiscriminatory rationale for its decision\n       [step two]. The existence of an affirmative\n       action plan provides such a rationale. If such a\n       plan is articulated as the basis for the\n       employer’s decision, the burden shifts to the\n       plaintiff to prove that the employer’s\n       justification is pretextual and the plan is\n       invalid [step three].\n\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Application of that framework, the\nJohnson Court emphasized, “does not mean . . . that reliance\non an affirmative action plan is to be treated as an affirmative\ndefense requiring the employer to carry the burden of proving\nthe validity of the plan. The burden of proving its invalidity\nremains on the plaintiff.” Id. at 627.\n\n     The Johnson Court explained that it would “be guided by\n[its] decision in Weber.” Id. In Weber, the Court noted, it\nhad blessed an affirmative action plan that (i) sought to\n“eliminate manifest racial imbalances in traditionally\nsegregated job categories”; and (ii) did not “unnecessarily\ntrammel the interests of white employees.” Id. at 628-30.\nThe Court found the requisite “manifest imbalance” to exist in\nJohnson in light of the complete absence of women in the\npositions in question. Id. at 636. The Court further\ndetermined that the County’s plan did not “unnecessarily\ntrammel[] the rights of male employees” based on a number\nof factors (without ascribing weight or rank to any single\none). Id. at 637-40. In particular, the plan imposed “goals,”\nnot “quotas.” Id. at 638. The plan worked such that “[n]o\npersons [were] automatically excluded from consideration; all\n[were] able to have their qualifications weighed against those\nof other applicants,” with gender considered only as a “plus.”\nId. The plan did not abrogate any “absolute entitlement” of\n\f                              16\nmale employees, as it operated only in the context of\npromotions, the denial of which would “unsettle[] no\nlegitimate, firmly rooted expectation[s].” Id. And the plan\nwas temporary, in that it “was intended to attain a balanced\nwork force, not to maintain one.” Id. at 639.\n\n     For nearly three decades, Johnson has guided courts—\nincluding ours—in the analysis of Title VII claims alleging\nunlawful reverse discrimination.

DeStefano,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145848\"><a href=\"/opinion/145848/ricci-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Ricci, the Court considered the City of New\nHaven’s actions in the aftermath of the City’s administration\nof a firefighter promotional examination. The results of the\nexam showed a statistical racial disparity: White candidates\nhad outperformed minority candidates. Id. at 562. Some\nfirefighters threatened to bring a discrimination lawsuit if the\nCity relied on the test in making promotions. Id. The City\nresponded by throwing out the test results. A group of white\nand Hispanic firefighters sued the City under Title VII,\n\f                               17\nclaiming that, by discarding the test, the City had engaged in\nunlawful reverse discrimination against them. Id. at 562-63.\n\n     The Supreme Court ruled in the firefighters’ favor. The\nCourt understood that the City’s “objective” in discarding the\ntests was to “avoid[] disparate-impact liability” under Title\nVII. Id. at 579. But the Court concluded that, by rejecting the\nresults of the promotional test “because of the statistical\ndisparity based on race,” the City had engaged in “express,\nrace-based decisionmaking.” Id. The Court held that “race-\nbased action like the City’s in this case is impermissible under\nTitle VII unless the employer can demonstrate a strong basis\nin evidence that, had it not taken the action, it would have\nbeen liable under” Title VII’s disparate-impact prohibition.\nId. at 563; see id. at 585. That is, the Court held that the City\ncould not invalidate the test results based on the race of the\nhighest scorers for the asserted purpose of avoiding a\ndisparate-impact lawsuit, unless the City had a strong basis in\nevidence to believe that it would be found liable in such a\nsuit. The City could not meet that burden. Id. at 592.\n\n     Shea argues that Ricci upends Johnson and Weber such\nthat those earlier decisions no longer guide our analysis here.\nUnder Johnson and Weber, we would first assess the\nsufficiency of Shea’s prima facie case, then turn to the State\nDepartment’s proffer of a valid affirmative action plan, and\nfinally examine Shea’s efforts to demonstrate the invalidity of\nthat plan. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Throughout, Shea\nwould retain the burden of proving the invalidity of the\nDepartment’s 1990-92 Plan. Id. at 627. Ricci changed all of\nthis, Shea submits: After Ricci, Shea argues, we must jettison\nJohnson and Weber’s framework and instead ask whether the\nState Department can show “a strong basis in evidence that,\nhad it not [instituted an affirmative action plan], it would have\nbeen liable” for discrimination under Title VII. Ricci, 557\n\f                              18\nU.S. at 563 (emphasis added). And, if the Department proves\nunable to put forth the requisite “strong basis in evidence” in\nsupport of that showing, Shea contends, the Department\nwould be liable under Title VII for impermissible reverse\ndiscrimination.\n\n     The Department initially argues that Shea forfeited any\nargument based on Ricci by failing to present that argument to\nthe district court.     We disagree.      Although forfeiture\nprinciples apply to new arguments raised for the first time on\nappeal, see Potter v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187333\"><a href=\"/opinion/187333/potter-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 547\n(D.C. Cir. 2009), Shea’s argument has been consistent\nthroughout the litigation: The Department’s 1990-92 Plan\nimpermissibly discriminated against him in violation of Title\nVII. On appeal, Shea enjoys a measure of latitude to\nelaborate on his theory in service of the same argument. His\nreliance on Ricci for the first time on appeal lies within that\nlatitude. Moreover, although Shea did not press a Ricci-based\nargument before the district court, the district court invoked\nRicci on its own, observing that “nothing in Ricci directly\noverturns or modifies Johnson, at least as it applies to this\ncase.” Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 54 n.17. Shea is permitted to\nrespond on appeal by explaining why he thinks Ricci governs\nthis case. See Citizens United v. Fed. Election Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 330 (2010).\n\n    Shea’s argument based on Ricci fails on the merits,\nhowever. Johnson and Weber are directly applicable to this\ncase. They set out the framework for “evaluating the\ncompliance of an affirmative action plan with Title VII’s\nprohibition on discrimination,” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 640, the\nprecise question in issue here.             Those decisions\nunquestionably would control our analysis unless a\nsubsequent decision dictates otherwise. Ricci is not such a\ndecision. In reaching that conclusion, we draw guidance from\n\f                               19\nthe Supreme Court’s admonition against concluding that its\n“more recent cases have, by implication, overruled an earlier\nprecedent.” Agostini v. Felton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118133\"><a href=\"/opinion/118133/agostini-v-felton/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 237 (1997).\nRather, if “a precedent of [the Supreme] Court has direct\napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in\nsome other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should\nfollow the case which directly controls, leaving to [the] Court\nthe prerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Id.\n\n     Here, Johnson and Weber have “direct application,” and\nwe have no occasion or cause to conclude that Ricci, “by\nimplication,” overruled those decisions. Id. Indeed, Ricci\ndoes not mention or even cite—much less discuss—Johnson\nand Weber. That is understandable, as Ricci, by its own\ndescription, addressed a particular situation not in issue here.\nCf. Ricci, 557 U.S. at 626 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (“[Ricci]\ndoes not involve affirmative action.”). In Ricci, the Court’s\n“analysis beg[an] with this premise: The City’s actions would\nviolate the disparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII absent\nsome valid defense.” Id. at 579. The inquiry prescribed by\nJohnson and Weber, by contrast, pertains to assessing whether\nthere is a violation of Title VII’s disparate-treatment\nprohibition in the first place, the same question we address\nhere.\n\n     The specific question addressed in Ricci was whether,\neven though the City’s action in discarding the test results was\nassumed to violate Title VII’s disparate-treatment prohibition,\nthat action could be justified based on a particular objective\nasserted by the City: avoiding liability in a Title VII disparate-\nimpact lawsuit. The Court expressly framed its holding by\nreference to actions taken for that particular purpose:\n\n       We hold only that, under Title VII, before an\n       employer can engage in intentional\n\f                               20\n       discrimination for the asserted purpose of\n       avoiding or remedying an unintentional\n       disparate impact, the employer must have a\n       strong basis in evidence to believe it will be\n       subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to\n       take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.\n\nId; see id. at 580 (“We consider, therefore, whether the\npurpose to avoid disparate-impact liability excuses what\notherwise would be prohibited disparate-treatment\ndiscrimination.”) (emphasis added).\n\n    The employers in Johnson and Weber did not modify the\noutcomes of personnel processes for the asserted purpose of\navoiding disparate-impact liability under Title VII. Nor did\nthe State Department here. The Department, like the\nemployers in Johnson and Weber, instead acted to “expand[]\njob opportunities for minorities and women,” Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 622, and to “eliminate traditional patterns of racial\nsegregation,” Weber, 443 U.S. at 201; see id. at 209 & n.9.\nRicci does not purport to reach the Department’s actions in\npursuit of those purposes. Weber and Johnson therefore still\ncontrol. The only other court of appeals of which we are\naware to have addressed the interaction between Ricci and the\nJohnson-Weber framework reached the same conclusion. See\nUnited States v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2470930\"><a href=\"/opinion/2470930/united-states-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 102-04 (2d Cir. 2011).\n\n                               IV.\n\n     Under the framework established by Johnson and Weber,\nwe ask first if Shea establishes a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination. Second, we examine whether the State\nDepartment can articulate a nondiscriminatory reason—in this\ncase, a valid affirmative action plan—for its actions. Finally,\nwe assess whether Shea carries his burden to prove that the\n\f                              21\nDepartment’s plan is invalid. The district court found that\nShea and the Department made the requisite showings at the\nfirst and second steps, respectively. The court then found\nShea to falter at the third step and therefore granted summary\njudgment in favor of the Department. We agree at each step.\n\n                              A.\n\n     We first address whether Shea has made out a prima facie\ncase of reverse discrimination in violation of Title VII. At the\noutset, we note that neither party has addressed the potential\nimplications of our decision in Brady v. Office of Sergeant at\nArms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187112\"><a href=\"/opinion/187112/brady-v-office-of-sergeant-at-arms/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2008), for Johnson’s direction\nto assess whether the “plaintiff establishes a prima facie\ncase,” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Brady explained that, when\n“an employee has suffered an adverse employment action and\nan employer has asserted a legitimate, non-discriminatory\nreason for the decision, the district court need not—and\nshould not—decide whether the plaintiff actually made out a\nprima facie case.” 520 F.3d at 494. Rather, “the district court\nmust resolve one central question: Has the employee\nproduced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that\nthe employer’s asserted non-discriminatory reason was not\nthe actual reason and that the employer intentionally\ndiscriminated against the employee on the basis of” a\nprohibited characteristic? Id. We have since invoked Brady\nin the context of a reverse-discrimination claim. See Ginger\nv. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187191\"><a href=\"/opinion/187191/ginger-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1340</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1344 (D.C. Cir.\n2008).\n\n     We have not, however, specifically applied Brady in the\ncontext of a reverse-discrimination suit challenging the\nvalidity of an employer’s affirmative action plan under Title\nVII. In that domain, Johnson has long set forth the governing\napproach. Because no party on appeal argues that Brady\n\f                               22\nshould alter that framework, and because the existence of a\nprima facie case is readily resolved in this case in Shea’s\nfavor, we leave for another day the resolution of the\ninteraction between Brady and Johnson. We therefore\nproceed on the assumption that Johnson’s framework—\nincluding its call for examining the establishment of a prima\nfacie case—is controlling for our purposes.\n\n     Here, the State Department contests Shea’s establishment\nof a prima facie case in only one respect. As part of the\nshowing necessary to make out a prima facie case of\ndiscrimination (or reverse discrimination) in violation of Title\nVII, a plaintiff must establish that he has been subjected to an\nadverse employment action. George v. Leavitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186439\"><a href=\"/opinion/186439/george-diane-v-leavitt-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n412 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The Department argues on appeal, for\nthe first time in this case’s long history, that Shea suffered no\nadverse employment action from his hiring at an entry-level\n(rather than mid-level) position because he never applied for\ndirect mid-level placement, either through the 1990-92 Plan\nor through the race-neutral CCP. We do not reach the merits\nof that argument because the Department forfeited it by\nfailing to raise it until this late stage.\n\n     Although “we may affirm a judgment on any ground that\nthe record supports and that the opposing party had a fair\nopportunity to address,” Jones v.

The Department at no point in the\nprevious fourteen years of litigating this case contended that\nShea’s failure to apply for a mid-level position could affect\nhis establishment of a prima facie case. It has instead fought\nShea’s prima facie showing on other grounds. “[A]bsent\nexceptional circumstances not present here, it is not our\n\f                               23\npractice to entertain issues first raised on appeal.”\nMarymount Hosp., 19 F.3d at 663 (quoting Roosevelt v.

We adhere to that\npractice today. Because the Department has forfeited any\nargument that Shea suffered no adverse employment action,\nand because the Department otherwise does not challenge his\nestablishment of a prima facie case on appeal, we agree with\nthe district court that Shea has made that showing.\n\n                               B.\n\n     At the second step of Johnson’s framework, the\nDepartment must “articulate a nondiscriminatory rationale for\nits decision.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. Johnson observes\nthat “[t]he existence of an affirmative action plan provides\nsuch a rationale.” Id. We do not understand Johnson to\nmean, however, that an employer establishes a legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for its decision merely by showing\nthat it acted pursuant to an affirmative action plan. See Hill v.\nRoss, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765135\"><a href=\"/opinion/765135/paul-hill-v-howard-l-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 590 (7th Cir. 1999).\n\n     Rather, the Johnson framework maps onto McDonnell\nDouglas’s three steps.

Cir. 1981), an invalid\naffirmative action plan is discriminatory, see Taxman, 91 F.3d\nat 1567. As a result, the Department needs to produce\n“evidence which, taken as true, would permit the conclusion”\n\f                               24\nthat it acted for a “nondiscriminatory reason,” i.e., pursuant to\na valid affirmative action plan. Hicks, 509 U.S. at 509\n(emphasis omitted); see Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 33-34.\n\n     We have explained that, under Johnson and Weber, a\nvalid affirmative action plan should satisfy two general\nconditions. First, a valid plan rests on an adequate factual\npredicate justifying its adoption, such as a “manifest\nimbalance” in a “traditionally segregated job categor[y].”\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 631; see Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 74-75.\nSecond, a valid plan refrains from “unnecessarily\ntrammel[ing] the rights of [white] employees.” Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 637-38; see Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 81. We take up\nthose considerations in order.\n\n                               1.\n\n    The district court concluded that the Department\nadequately grounded its 1990-92 Plan in evidence of a\nmanifest imbalance in a traditionally segregated job category.\nSee Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 34-39.                We agree.\n\n                               a.\n\n     Ascertaining the existence of a “manifest imbalance” is a\n“fact-specific task” in a “sensitive and delicate area.”\nHammon II, 826 F.2d at 75. One method that may be used to\ndemonstrate such an imbalance—and the one relied on by the\nState Department here—entails a showing of statistical\ndisparities between the racial makeup of the employer’s\nworkforce and that of a “comparator population.” If the\npositions in question “require no special expertise,” the\ncomparator population would be “‘the area labor market or\ngeneral population.’” Id. (citation omitted) (quoting Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 632). But for “jobs that require special training,”\n\f                              25\nthe ‘“comparison should be with those in the labor force who\npossess the relevant qualifications.’” Id. (citation omitted)\n(quoting Johnson, 480 U.S. at 632).\n\n    When the Department adopted the 1990-92 Plan, the\nagency had before it two analyses comparing its own\nworkforce with the labor pool possessing the relevant\nqualifications: (i) the 1989 GAO Report, and (ii) a formal\nanalysis conducted by the Department itself when\npromulgating the 1990-92 Plan. The Department points to\nthose two statistical studies as its principal evidence of a\nmanifest imbalance between minority representation in the\nForeign Service and the comparator population.\n\n     Shea contends that the Department cannot rely on either\nof those studies. He argues that the 1990-92 Plan amounted\nonly to a continuation of a preexisting affirmative action plan\nin place from 1987-89, and that the 1990-92 Plan thus was\nactually adopted in 1987. Shea submits that any data on\nwhich the Department purports to justify any affirmative\naction plan must have been in its possession when it\npromulgated the plan—which, by Shea’s account, would have\nbeen in 1987, before either the 1989 GAO Report or the 1990-\n92 Plan’s analysis. Consequently, Shea argues, the State\nDepartment is foreclosed from invoking either study as a\njustification for its actions.\n\n     We assume arguendo the correctness of Shea’s premise\nthat the Department cannot justify its race-conscious actions\nby reference to post hoc data collection. Even so, Shea errs in\ncontending that the Department cannot rely on the 1989 GAO\nReport or the findings contained in the 1990-92 Plan to justify\nthe Plan. The district court concluded that the Department’s\n1987-89 affirmative action efforts and the 1990-92 Plan in\nfact were two different plans. See Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at\n\f                              26\n30. We would tend to agree. But even if otherwise, the 1990-\n92 Plan at the very least amounted to a review and overhaul of\nthe Department’s affirmative action efforts. See, e.g., U.S.\nDep’t of State, Multi-Year Plan, FY 1990-92 at 51 (rev.\nversion Apr. 30, 1991) (1990-92 Plan Document) (assembling\nnew diversity statistics for purposes of the 1990-92 Plan); id.\nat 61 (noting that the 1987-89 plan “has been refined . . . to\ndefine better the type of candidate to be recruited” (emphasis\nadded)). “When a program that has been reauthorized is\nchallenged, all evidence available to the [decisionmaker] prior\nto reauthorization must be considered in assessing” the\nprogram’s legality.

U.S. Dep’t of Def.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774675\"><a href=\"/opinion/774675/rothe-development-corporation-v-united-states-department-of-defense-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">262</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Accordingly, even if\nthe 1990-92 Plan amounted to a reauthorization of the\nDepartment’s 1987-89 affirmative action efforts, and even if\nthe Department cannot justify its actions based on post hoc\ndata, the 1989 GAO Report and the findings contained in the\n1990-92 Plan are a proper evidentiary proffer.\n\n     The version of the 1990-92 Plan in our record contains\nthe Department’s employment data from 1989 and 1990. As\nthe 1989 data represent the data in the State Department’s\npossession both at the time it promulgated the 1990-92 Plan\nand at the time Shea applied to the Foreign Service, we use\nthat data (though we note that the minor differences between\nthe 1989 and 1990 data would have no impact on our\nconclusions today). The 1990-92 Plan’s findings showed\nimprovement in the Foreign Service’s diversity from the time\nof the 1989 GAO Report. The combined FS-02 and -03\nlevels, for instance, showed underrepresentation only for\nNative Americans and Alaskans.           See 1990-92 Plan\nDocument at 46a; 47a. For other minority populations at the\ncombined FS-02 and -03 positions, there were no imbalances,\nmanifest or otherwise. As a result, Shea contends, the\nDepartment cannot justify the 1990-92 Plan by claiming that\n\f                              27\nit addressed manifest imbalances for all minority groups at\nthose levels.\n\n     The Department initially asserts that the 1990-92 Plan\nestablished “goals” only for groups specifically shown in the\ndata to be underrepresented. We take this to mean, for\nexample, that, at the combined FS-02 and -03 levels, “goals”\nwould have been set only for Native Americans and Alaskans,\nand not for other minority populations. If the “goals”\noperated such that only members of the underrepresented\nminority groups received favorable treatment in the\napplication process relative to Shea, the Department’s\nargument would have force. But the Department provides no\ninformation about how the “goals” would have worked in\npractice. And we find no description in the record. All that\nwe can glean from the record is that all minority applicants\nreceived the main benefit available under the 1990-92 Plan—\nwaiver of the certificate-of-need requirement for entry into the\nFS-01, -02, and -03 levels.\n\n     The Department’s defense of the 1990-92 Plan stands on\nstronger footing, however, with regard to more senior-level\npositions. Looking up the ranks from the FS-02 and -03\nlevels, the Department identified a more across-the-board\nmanifest imbalance. The Department first points to the FS-01\nlevel. According to the 1990-92 Plan data, all minority\ngroups were underrepresented at the FS-01 level at the time of\nthe plan’s promulgation. To achieve full representation, the\nnumber of black Officers at that level would have needed to\nincrease by 62%, Hispanics by 14%, Native Americans and\nAlaskans by 256%, and Asians and Pacific Islanders by 47%.\nSee 1990-92 Plan Document at 46a; 47a.\n\n    The Department also points to the ranks of the SFS. The\n1990-92 Plan, so far as we can tell, contains no specific data\n\f                             28\non diversity in the SFS. Accordingly, we look to the SFS\nfindings from the 1989 GAO Report. Those findings show\nunderrepresentation of all minority groups at the SFS level.\nAnd the imbalances are manifest:            To achieve full\nrepresentation, the number of black Officers in the SFS would\nhave needed to increase by 154%, Hispanics by 163%, Asians\nand Pacific Islanders by 700%, and, for Native Americans and\nAlaskans, by an undefined percentage (because the Foreign\nService had no SFS Officer of Native American or Alaskan\norigin). See 1989 GAO Report at 17.\n\n                              b.\n\n     Johnson speaks in terms not just of any manifest\nimbalance, but of a manifest imbalance in a traditionally\nsegregated job category. 480 U.S. at 631. As the Court\nexplained, the “requirement that the manifest imbalance relate\nto a traditionally segregated job category provides\nassurance” that “race will be taken into account in a manner\nconsistent with Title VII’s purpose of eliminating the effects\nof employment discrimination.” Id. at 632 (quotation marks\nomitted). That approach guards against licensing an employer\nto seek proportional representation purely for its own sake.\nThe Department must make a showing that, if taken as true,\nwould permit the conclusion that the manifest imbalance\nresulted from a “predicate of discrimination” rather than from\nbenign forces. Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 74-75, 80-81. We\nfind that the Department has done so.\n\n     First, the substantial imbalances at the SFS level\nthemselves indicate that discriminatory practices may well\nhave been afoot. While a significant disparity is not itself\ndispositive, “ranks [that are] overwhelming[ly] white” are “a\npowerful present-day demonstration of a prior regime of\ndiscrimination.” Hammon v.

For example, one\nwitness testified that, when he “entered on duty in State in late\n1965 . . . [he] had [his] first experience with discrimination,\naside from what [he] had experienced while stationed in the\nSouth,” and further noted that “[m]inorities have been\nunderrepresented purposefully” within the Department. 1989\nSubcomm. Hearing at 33, 39. Another witness, focusing on\ngender discrimination at the Department, explained that,\nwhile “[i]nstances of blatant sexism and discrimination have\ndeclined, . . . some do still take place,” and “a simple glance\nat the statistics contained in the [1989 GAO Report] . . . will\nconfirm the continued existence of a problem.” Id. at 42. The\nformer EEOC Commissioner offered his assessment that\n“[t]he State Department wants to hire what I call the mythical\nAmerican, the 5’10,” 160 pound WASP man in perfect\nphysical and mental health.” J.A. 342. And the Department’s\nDeputy Assistant for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights\nprovided testimony that, around the world, he had\n“encountered complaints of discrimination from [State’s]\nemployees and criticisms from foreigners for that same\ndiscrimination as exhibited by our predominantly white male\ndiplomatic corps.” Id. at 13.\n\f                              30\n\n     To the House Subcommittee on the Civil Service, such\ntestimony likely came as no surprise. While the record before\nus does not contain the underlying materials, Representative\nSikorski, the Subcommittee Chairman, stated his belief that\nthose reports confirmed a State Department inadequately\nconcerned with diversity.       Previous investigations and\nhearings by his subcommittee, he stated, “documented serious\ninstances of discriminatory treatment by the Foreign Service\nof women, minorities, and people with handicaps.” 1989\nJoint Hearing at 10. His testimony included the revelation\nthat “more than 240 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)\ncases” had been filed and indications that previous efforts to\ndiversify the Foreign Service championed by the Secretary of\nState were “largely ignored by the Department.”            Id.\nMoreover, he noted, the Department had “been repeatedly\ncited by the [EEOC] for submitting deficient [diversity]\nreports.” Id. The 1989 GAO Report noted that, despite\nrepeated criticism including suggestions of bias, the State\nDepartment never “conducted analyses of possible\nimpediments to equal employment opportunity.” 1989 GAO\nReport at 4.\n\n     This case is therefore a far cry from our decisions in\nHammon I and II, in which we determined that the District of\nColumbia had failed to demonstrate the predicate of\ndiscrimination necessary to justify an affirmative action\nprogram for its hiring of firefighters. The challenged plan\npurportedly addressed the District’s history of discriminatory\nhiring against black applicants. But during the relevant\nhistorical period, blacks made up an average of 41.8% of the\nfirefighters hired each year, Hammon I, 813 F.2d at 427, and,\nat the time of the challenge, 37% of the firefighting workforce\noverall, Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 77. The proper comparator\npool was 29.3% black. Hammon I, 813 F.2d at 428. In light\n\f                             31\nof those figures, the District “steadfastly and persuasively\nprotested its innocence of any discriminatory activity,” and\nwe agreed. Id. at 427.\n\n     Here, by contrast, evidence identified by the Department\nwould permit the conclusion that there had been a past\npractice of discrimination with continuing effects through the\nearly 1990s. We therefore agree with the district court that\nthe Department made an adequate evidentiary proffer that the\n1990-92 Plan “served to remedy the lingering effects of\nState’s past discrimination.” Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 39.\n\n                              2.\n\n     Having shown the necessary factual predicate for the\n1990-92 Plan in the form of a manifest imbalance in a\ntraditionally segregated job category, the Department faces\none additional requirement:       The plan must not have\nunnecessarily trammeled the rights of white applicants.\nJohnson, 480 U.S. at 637-38; Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 81.\nWe, like the district court, conclude that the Department has\nmade an adequate showing in this regard.\n\n                              a.\n\n     There is “no precise formula for determining whether an\naffirmative action plan unnecessarily trammels the rights of\nnon-beneficiaries.”        In   re    Birmingham    Reverse\nDiscrimination Emp’t Litig., 20 F.3d at 1541. Rather, a\nnumber of considerations inform the inquiry. See Johnson,\n480 U.S. at 637-40; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208-09; Hammon II,\n826 F.2d at 81. Those considerations weigh in favor of the\n1990-92 Plan’s validity.\n\f                                32\n     First, the type of affirmative action plan matters.\nAffirmative action in hiring generally poses less of a concern\nthan affirmative action in layoffs. See Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n638. Hiring decisions upset settled expectations to a lesser\ndegree (because an applicant has no absolute entitlement to a\njob), and they affect a more diffuse group (all potential\napplicants) than do layoffs, which target specific employees.\nSee United States v. Paradise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111827\"><a href=\"/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">149</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 183 (1987)\n(plurality opinion) (“Denial of a future employment\nopportunity . . . is not as intrusive as loss of an existing job.”)\n(quotation marks omitted); cf. Firefighters Local Union No.\n1784 v. Stotts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111211\"><a href=\"/opinion/111211/firefighters-v-stotts/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578-79 (1984). Here, the 1990-\n92 Plan awarded benefits to minority candidates only in the\nhiring process, and even then, only at the very initial stage.\n\n     Second, the degree of benefit, or “plus,” bestowed by the\naffirmative action plan can make a difference. Affirmative\naction resulting in the hiring only of qualified candidates\nmore easily survives scrutiny than affirmative action resulting\nin the hiring of unqualified beneficiaries. See Johnson, 480\nU.S. at 637-38. In this case, the Department’s 1990-92 Plan\nprovided for hiring only of qualified candidates: Minority\napplicants considered through the 1990-92 Plan underwent\nthe same rigorous application path as did white candidates\nconsidered through the race-neutral CCP, with the only\ndifference coming in the form of the certificate-of-need\nwaiver at the threshold.\n\n    Third, the goals of the affirmative action plan affect the\ninquiry. A plan that seeks to achieve full representation for\nthe particular purpose of remedying past discrimination will\ngenerally be shorter in duration than one that pursues\nproportional diversity for its own sake. When a plan pursues\nonly the former goal, it presumably would cease to operate\nonce full representation is achieved. And the shorter the time\n\f                              33\nperiod for which a plan is in operation, the less it could be\nsaid adversely to affect non-beneficiaries. In Weber, for\ninstance, the Court approvingly observed that the plan it\nupheld was “not intended to maintain racial balance, but\nsimply to eliminate a manifest racial imbalance.” 443 U.S. at\n208; see Johnson, 480 U.S. at 639-40. Here, the 1990-92 Plan\nsought to attain more proportional representation, not to\nmaintain it in perpetuity. Indeed, the 1990-92 Plan ceased to\noperate in 1993 and has not been replaced. Shea, 961 F.\nSupp. 2d at 41-42.\n\n     Fourth, the extent to which the challenged plan limits\nopportunities for advancement by non-beneficiaries is a\nrelevant consideration. In both Johnson and Weber, the Court\nobserved that the plan in question created no “absolute bar” to\nthe advancement of non-beneficiaries. Johnson, 480 U.S. at\n637-38; Weber, 443 U.S. at 208. Here, Shea makes no\nargument that the 1990-92 Plan engendered any “absolute\nbar” to the advancement of non-minorities in the Foreign\nService ranks. Non-minority candidates from outside the\nagency could apply directly to the mid-level ranks through the\nrace-neutral CCP, and internal white candidates could—and\ndid—gain promotion to mid-level positions from the Foreign\nService entry-level ranks.\n\n                               b.\n\n    Our court has understood the need to avoid\n“unnecessarily” trammeling the rights of non-minority\ncandidates to indicate that a challenged affirmative action\nplan generally must be “tailored to fit the violation” sought to\nbe addressed. Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 74; see id. at 81. Here,\nthe 1990-92 Plan granted a certificate-of-need waiver to\ncandidates applying to the FS-01, -02, and -03 levels. The\nDepartment’s identified manifest imbalances, however,\n\f                              34\noccurred at only the more senior levels. Why bestow benefits\nat the FS-02 and -03 levels if the manifest imbalances sought\nto be addressed existed only at more senior positions? To do\nso, Shea contends, means that the 1990-92 Plan was so over-\ninclusive as to unnecessarily trammel the rights of white\napplicants at the FS-02 and -03 levels.\n\n     The Department submits that there is a sound explanation\nfor targeting the FS-02 and -03 levels to address an imbalance\nat more senior levels. The 1990-92 Plan satisfies the tailoring\nrequirement, the Department explains, because the FS-02 and\n-03 levels serve as the training grounds for learning the skills\nnecessary to perform at the SFS and FS-01 levels. We agree.\n\n     The plan upheld in Weber is instructive. The employer in\nWeber aimed to remedy the manifest imbalance in its ranks of\nskilled workers: a mere 1.83% of its skilled workers were\nblack, while the labor force in the surrounding area was 39%\nblack. 443 U.S. at 198-99. To address the identified\nimbalance in its skilled workforce, however, the employer\ncould not simply hire laborers lacking the requisite skills.\nRather, it needed to hire laborers after they had acquired those\nskills. The employer established a training program to tackle\nthat problem, stipulating that 50% of all employees entering\nthe training program would be black until the percentage of\nblack skilled workers in its workforce approximated the\npercentage in the local labor force. See id. at 199.\n\n     Weber thus provides an example of an affirmative action\nplan going beyond strictly proportional representation in a\ntraining program: 50% of the spots would go to the\ncompany’s black workers, even though black persons made\nup only 39% of the area labor force. Employees who had\ncompleted Weber’s training program could then proceed to\nthe rank of skilled worker, where the manifest imbalance\n\f                                35\nexisted. The need to create an adequate pipeline of trained\nworkers meant that the program was sufficiently tailored to\ntarget the “manifest imbalance” among skilled workers.\n\n    The State Department’s 1990-92 Plan worked similarly.\nIn order to attain full representation at the SFS and FS-01\nlevels, the Department maintains, it had to go beyond strictly\nproportional minority representation at the FS-02 and -03\nlevels.    It could then choose from qualified minority\ncandidates at those levels to staff its SFS and FS-01 ranks.\n\n     With regard to the SFS, the Department’s hiring\nregulations in place at the time of the 1990-92 Plan\ndemonstrate that the Department valued a certain set of skills\nin its SFS Officers and believed that the best way for SFS\ncandidates to gain those experiences was through service in\nthe mid-level Foreign Service ranks.             The regulations\nprovided that career SFS Officers “normally shall be\nappointed as the result of promotion of Mid-Level career\nofficers,” and generally limited the SFS to a maximum of five\npercent external hires at any given time. Appointment of\nMembers of the Foreign Service, 48 Fed. Reg. 38,606, 38,607\n(Aug. 25, 1983).        Additionally, career SFS applicants\ngenerally had to have completed at least five years of service\nin a position “of responsibility . . . equivalent to that of a Mid-\nLevel Foreign Service officer (classes FS-1 through FS-3),”\nwith “duties and responsibilities . . . similar to or closely\nrelated to that of a Foreign Service officer in terms of\nknowledge, skills, abilities, and overseas work experience.”\nId. The difficulties encountered by those directly promoted to\na mid- or high-level position in the Foreign Service, which\nusually included a “prolonged adjustment period” and\nexperiencing “a competitive disadvantage,” further suggest\nthat percolating through the ranks was, generally, a sounder\ncareer path.\n\f                               36\n\n     The conclusion from the then-existing regulations is\nstraightforward: The Department believed that the best\ntraining for the role of a SFS Officer was experience as an FS-\n01, -02, or -03 Foreign Service Officer. The Department\nsimilarly valued skills gleaned from experience at the FS-02\nand -03 ranks for the position of an FS-01, with outside hires\ninto the FS-01 ranks serving as the small exception to the\nDepartment’s general internal promotion ladder. See J.A.\n343, 516-17. Shea has introduced no evidence contradicting\nthat understanding.\n\n     In view of the Department’s assessment that the most\nqualified candidates for the SFS and FS-01 ranks would come\nfrom its own mid-levels, the Department understandably saw\na need to go further than strictly proportional representation in\nits mid-levels.      That was necessary, the Department\nreasonably concluded, in order to have a sufficient reservoir\nof talented minority candidates from which to hire in order to\nachieve diversity in its SFS and FS-01 ranks. Otherwise,\nassuming that promotion rates were the same across races\nfrom the mid-levels to the SFS and FS-01 levels, the\nDepartment would need to await a great deal of turnover in\nthe overwhelmingly white SFS and FS-01 ranks before the\nsubstantial imbalances at those levels would be rectified.\n\n    Congressional testimony on the 1989 GAO Report\nreveals that very concern. Joseph Kelley of the General\nAccounting Office, in response to questioning about when\n“the State Department [would] become representative of the\nAmerican people,” told Congress that “[i]t is going to take a\nlong time,” and noted that the EEOC had been pushing the\nDepartment “to have a program to move people around and to\nhave upper-level promotions, but it ha[d]n’t worked out that\nwell.” 1989 Subcomm. Hearing at 29-30. The Department\n\f                              37\nrequired a method by which to augment the flow of minority\ncandidates to the SFS and FS-01 levels. As Representative\nSikorski observed, “if the numbers [only] get[] better\nin . . . entry level and hiring,” then “there is no upward\nprogress. There is no flow in the right direction. We are\ntalking centuries.” Id. at 29-30.\n\n     It is no answer to claim that the Department could simply\npromote minorities to the SFS and FS-01 levels at higher rates\nthan their non-minority peers. That itself would have been a\nrace-conscious action requiring justification. That option, at\nany rate, appears to have been non-viable. Testimony before\nCongress indicated that promotions of minorities to high-level\npositions were already happening “too fast,” such that the\nDepartment began “to get a backlash” that promotions were\n“not [of] qualified . . . minorities” and that those promoted\nwere “not really ready to make this jump.” Id. at 47. Title\nVII does not require the Department to promote unqualified\ncandidates to execute the important mission of our diplomatic\ncorps. For those reasons, the 1990-92 Plan’s emphasis on\nhiring at mid-level positions was adequately tailored to\naddress manifest imbalances at the senior levels.\n\n     At its root, finally, the unnecessary trammeling inquiry\namounts to an exercise in balancing a plan’s attempts to\nremedy past discrimination against the plan’s adverse impact\non the rights of non-minorities. In this case, the latter impact\nwas unquestionably limited. The 1989 GAO Report indicates\nthat the State Department had 655 SFS Officers, 836 FS-01\nOfficers, and 2,032 FS-02 or -03 Officers. 1989 GAO Report\nat 17. Against that backdrop, the Department informs us that\nonly sixteen minority candidates were hired into the mid-\nlevels through the 1990-92 Plan over the three calendar years\nof its operation. With such a modest effect on the hiring\nprocess, the 1990-92 Plan was necessarily limited in the\n\f                              38\nextent to which it could            “trammel”   Shea’s   rights,\n“unnecessarily” or otherwise.\n\n                               c.\n\n     The tailoring inquiry, according to our decisions, also\ntakes into account whether the employer considered race-\nneutral alternatives. See Hammon II, 826 F.2d at 81. While\nthe program we considered in Hammon failed to pass muster\nbecause “reasonable alternatives were not seriously\ndiscussed,” Hammon I, 813 F.2d at 430, the district court in\nthis case found the Department’s evidence to show that it\nturned to the 1990-92 Plan’s race-conscious measures only\nafter race-neutral efforts failed to bear fruit. Shea, 961 F.\nSupp. 2d at 40-41. We agree.\n\n     The record documents a number of previous attempts to\ncorrect the identified imbalances without resort to explicit\nracial preferences, particularly through recruiting and\noutreach. From 1964 on, the Department targeted historically\nblack institutions as part of its “diplomat in residence”\nprogram, through which it assigned a senior-level Foreign\nService Officer to research, writing, and teaching duties at a\nuniversity in an effort to generate interest in the Foreign\nService among students. 1989 GAO Report at 24. From\n1980 on, the Department made a concentrated recruiting push\nto stimulate an increase in minority applicants, including by\n“provid[ing] information packages to colleges . . . and\nask[ing] college coordinators to encourage minorities . . . to\ntake the annual written [Foreign Service] examination.” Id. at\n22-23. The Department’s recruiters made special efforts to\nvisit colleges and universities with large minority enrollments.\nId. at 23. Ultimately, however, the Department concluded\nthat its “recruiting efforts [did] not increase[] the number of\nminorities taking the FS examination for officer positions.”\n\f                               39\nId. And in 1986, the Secretary of State implemented a\nrecommendation from black Foreign Service Officers aimed\nat elevating minority written exam pass rates by increasing\nminority enrollment in university courses relevant to the\nexam. That initiative, too, apparently proved unsatisfactory.\nSee id. at 25.\n\n     The Department also instituted “sensitivity training”\nbetween “senior management” and “senior minorities” to\naddress the gap, with little success. J.A. 369-70. Moreover, it\nconsidered implementing an entirely race-neutral mid-level\nentry program, but rejected that option as unlikely to be\neffective—an understandable conclusion in light of the\ninadequacy of State’s earlier reliance on “the promotion of\nentry level FS officers to eliminate underrepresentation at\nmore senior levels.” J.A. 301, 543. The 1990-92 Plan thus\nhardly constituted the Department’s maiden effort to solve its\npersistent diversity problem, and Shea points to no other race-\nneutral alternatives that should have been considered.\n\n     The Department, in short, has introduced evidence that\nthe 1990-92 Plan worked to target manifest imbalances in\nsenior-level positions in the Foreign Service Officer corps,\nand that those imbalances resulted from past discrimination.\nIt has also introduced evidence that the Plan refrained from\nunnecessarily trammeling the rights of non-minority\ncandidates. We therefore conclude that the Department\nsatisfies its burden to introduce evidence that, if taken as true,\ndemonstrates the 1990-92 Plan’s validity under Johnson and\nWeber.\n\n                               V.\n\n    Having concluded that the Department met its burden of\nproduction at the second step of the Johnson-McDonnell\n\f                              40\nDouglas framework, we ask at the final step whether Shea has\nproven that the Department’s “justification is pretextual and\nthe plan is invalid.” Johnson, 480 U.S. at 626. In the district\ncourt, Shea introduced his own lay statistical evidence in an\nattempt to show that the Department’s identified manifest\nimbalances did not exist. See Shea, 961 F. Supp. 2d at 45-53.\nThe district court rejected every piece of statistical evidence\nproffered by Shea as inadmissible. See id. Shea does not\nappeal those findings, and he raises no other claims of the\n1990-92 Plan’s invalidity for purposes of Johnson’s third\nstep. He therefore necessarily fails to carry his burden at that\nstep, warranting the entry of summary judgment in favor of\nthe Department.\n\n                      *   *    *   *    *\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment.\n                                                So ordered.\n\f     WILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring: I join the\ncourt’s opinion painstakingly applying the key Supreme Court\ncases, Johnson v.

I write separately to note that this area of the law\ncontinues to be rather amorphous and to call attention to a\nstatistical problem disclosed by the record but not raised by\nthe plaintiff on appeal.\n\n     Nearly three decades ago Judge Silberman observed that\nhe was “uncertain as to the meaning of ‘manifest imbalance.’”\nHammon v.

Cir. 1987)\n(Silberman, J., concurring in denial of rehearing). I fully\nshare that uncertainty, and would add that I have the same\nreaction to all of the key terms prescribed by the Supreme\nCourt for assessing affirmative action plans under Title VII:\nwhether there has been “manifest imbalance” in a\n“traditionally segregated job category,” and whether the plan\n“unnecessarily trammels the rights” of the persons disfavored.\nCourt Op., 24. It may be that the Supreme Court selected\nthese terms to assure that, without saying it in so many words,\nan employer can use race and gender for hiring or promoting\nminorities or women to the extent appropriate to assure that\nthere is no “underrepresentation”—i.e., to amend any non-\ntrivial deviation from proportionality to some more or less\nplausible applicant pool (at least so long as the employer can\nmuster vague, generalized and/or hearsay assertions of past\ndiscrimination). This is not a self-evident interpretation of\nTitle VII’s directive that employers are not “to discriminate\nagainst any individual . . . because of such individual’s race\n[or] sex.”\n\n     The effect is especially striking here: Shea neither\nchallenged the district court’s ruling that his analysis of the\nState Department’s calculations was inadmissible, Court Op.\n40, nor its ruling that the affirmative action plan’s repeated\n\f                                2\n\ndeclarations of “manifest imbalance” were sufficient without\nexpert provision of statistical support. See Shea v. Kerry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51-52 (D.D.C. 2013).                 The figures\nunderpinning State’s plan consist mainly of numerical\ncomparisons of various subgroups of Foreign Service\nemployees (“Administrative,” “Professional,” “Clerical,” etc.)\nwith a selected comparison group based on the “National\nCivilian Labor Force” data for various types of workers, e.g.,\n“Public Administration Administrators and Officials.” Joint\nAppendix (“J.A.”) 209, 216. The description of the study in\nthe record, J.A. 209, does not state what statistical test or\nstandard of statistical significance the authors used, or indeed\nwhether they used any statistical method at all. Certainly they\ndo not suggest that they made an adjustment in the standard\nfor statistical significance to account for the multiplicity of\nsubgroups, as would be necessary if we assume that State was\nseeking to identify only “imbalances” not attributable to\nrandom chance. “When interpreting . . . a table which\nsummarizes results from a number of comparisons, one must\nbear in mind that when the number of comparisons is large\n[State’s report included hundreds], the probability may be\nsubstantial that at least one disparity with a P-value less than\n.05 will occur because of pure chance.” David C. Baldus &\nJames W. L. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination § 9.03\n(Supp. 1987); see also id. at n.24a (“It is a mathematical fact\nthat where 17 independent comparisons are to be tested, the\nprobability of finding one or more to be statistically\nsignificant at the .05 level is .58, or almost 6 chances in 10.”).\n\n     Further impairing the value of the analysis is that many of\nthe subsets are so small as to indicate a complete lack of\nintelligible criteria for State’s assertions of “manifest\nimbalance,” a term the report often uses but never explains.\nThe report contains charts that split the workforce three ways\n(by occupational subgroup, ethnicity, and gender), and in one\ncase it announces that it “reveals” a “manifest imbalance” of\n\f                               3\n\nAmerican Indian females (who represent 0.2% of the labor\nforce comparison data) in the Finance Officer division, which\nemploys only 125 people. J.A. 224-25. It seems improbable\nthat any statistical test or standard of significance could yield\nevidence of a non-random “imbalance” for so small a\nsubgroup. To the extent the report is suggesting that some\npurported “imbalances” could be amended by the hiring of a\nsingle employee of the right ethnicity and gender in the\noccupational unit in question, that response would, in turn,\npresumably create “imbalance” in another direction—thus\nappearing to undermine whatever criteria may have been used\nto define “manifest imbalance.” See, e.g., J.A. 218-19; 224-\n25. I recognize that Johnson is quite specific in stating that\nthe proof of imbalance needed as a prerequisite for race- and\ngender-based affirmative action preferences is less than what\nis needed to establish a prima facie case of a Title VII\nviolation, 480 U.S. at 632-33, but an employer performing this\nexercise should at least be able to state its criteria for\n“manifest imbalance.”\n\n     The State Department in this respect sounds rather like\nthe defendant university in Hill v. Ross, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765135\"><a href=\"/opinion/765135/paul-hill-v-howard-l-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591\n(7th Cir. 1999): “What the University appears to have in\nmind is a world in which the absence of discrimination means\nthat every department would exactly mirror the population\nfrom which its members are hired. But that is statistical\nnonsense.” In Hill, Judge Easterbrook went on to explain in\ndetail what made the university’s theories nonsensical.\nWithout close attention, Johnson’s seeming license to pursue\nproportionality in a workforce can dissolve into a license to\npursue proportionality in almost any subset of the workforce.\n\f</pre>",
