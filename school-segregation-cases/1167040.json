No state lines divide the radio waves, and national regulation is not only appropriate but essential to the efficient use of radio facilities. * * *</p>\n<p>\"That the Congress had the power to give this authority to delete stations\" [the deleted station being in one state and the kc. frequency of the deleted station having been assigned to a station in another state], \"in view of the limited radio facilities available and the confusion that would result from interferences, is not open to question.\"</p>\n<p>See, also, Whitehurst v.

Such allegations are taken as true at this stage of the proceedings. It follows that if these allegations be true and the nature of the business and of radio activity and communication is as described in the bills of complaint, the statute imposing the tax is invalid, imposing, as it does, a direct burden on interstate commerce.
