The order directed the Commission to issue the requested permit. We find that the\nCommission’s denial conformed to the statute’s plain language, and the Commission did not act\narbitrarily or capriciously in initially denying the applicant’s request. We further find that the\nCommission’s denial was not based on political grounds, and we decline Spirited’s invitation to\naffirm the trial court on constitutional grounds. Thus, we reverse the trial court’s order directing\nthe Commission to issue the applicant a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and we reinstate the\nCommission’s order denying the permit.\n\n                                       Facts and Procedural History\n\n        Like many states, Indiana has an alcoholic beverage regulatory system, dividing\ndistribution into three distinct tiers – manufacture, wholesale, and retail. Monarch Beverage Co.\nv. Cook, 48 N.E.3d 325, 328 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015).                Within each tier, licenses are issued\nseparately for beer1, wine2, and liquor3. Among the many “interest restrictions” outlined in\nIndiana’s regulatory scheme, a pair of provisions prohibiting the holder of a beer wholesaler’s\npermit from having an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and vice-versa, are at issue here.\n\n        In September 2013, Spirited Sales, LLC (“Spirited”), an aspiring liquor wholesaler,\napplied to the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission for a liquor wholesaler’s permit.\nSpirited is registered in Delaware as a limited liability company. It is wholly owned by a parent\ncompany called E.F. Transit, Inc. (“EFT”), which transports beer, wine, and liquor throughout\n\n\n\n1\n  See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-2-1; 7.1-3-3-1; 7.1-3-4-1.\n2\n  See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-12-1; 7.1-3-13-1; 7.1-3-14-1.\n3\n  See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-7-1; 7.1-3-8-1; 7.1-3-9-1.\n\n                                                         2\n\fthe state. EFT’s ownership consists of five shareholders4. The same five shareholders also\nwholly own Monarch Beverage Company, Inc. (“Monarch”), an Indiana company that holds a\nbeer and wine wholesaler’s permit.\n\n        On December 16, 2014, after holding a public hearing at Spirited’s request, the\nCommission’s Executive Secretary, acting as hearing judge, issued findings of fact and\nconclusions of law, recommending that Spirited’s application be denied. The recommendation\nnoted that, despite some separation of business formalities, EFT and Monarch “operated as the\nsame company” and further found that a liquor wholesaler like Spirited, “entering into a contract\nwith EFT, would in reality be entering into a contract with Monarch.” Appellee's App. Vol. IX\nat 172. On January 20, 2015, the Commission adopted the proposed findings and conclusions,\nthus denying Spirited’s application.\n\n        Spirited then filed a petition in Marion Superior Court seeking judicial review of the\nCommission’s denial under the Administrative Orders and Procedures Act, Indiana Code Section\n4-21.5-5-1 et seq., and the alcoholic beverages permitting statute, Indiana Code section 7.1-3-23-\n30. On August 24, 2016, the trial court issued an order granting Spirited’s petition. The trial\ncourt order set aside the Commission’s order denying the permit and it directed the Commission\nto issue Spirited a liquor wholesaler’s permit. The trial court found that, in light of previous\nCommission decisions that cited to the corporate separateness doctrine in support of granting a\npermit to businesses whose owners held interests prohibited by statute, the Commission’s denial\nof Spirited’s application for a liquor wholesaler’s permit was arbitrary and capricious. The trial\ncourt also found that Spirited’s other arguments were consequently moot and did not warrant\nbeing addressed.\n\n        The Commission then filed a Notice of Appeal and moved the trial court to stay its order,\npending appeal. After briefing and a hearing, the trial court denied the stay motion on September\n23, 2016. To avoid any risk of contempt, the Commission issued Spirited a letter of authority\nthat same day, and then issued the permit on September 28, 2016. Thereafter, the Commission\n\n\n\n4\n EFT’s five shareholders are: 1) the Edwin T. French, Jr. Marital Trust, 2) the 2000 Irrevocable Monarch Trust for\nEdwin T. French III, 3) the 2000 Irrevocable Monarch Trust for Gail Anne French Pheffer, 4) Edwin T. French III,\nand 5) Gail Anne French Pheffer.\n\n                                                        3\n\fsought a stay from the Court of Appeals, which was summarily denied on October 25, 2016 by a\ndivided panel.\n\n          On October 31, 2016, the Commission filed motions seeking: 1) emergency transfer to\nthis Court, pursuant to Appellate Rule 56(A), and 2) a stay of the trial court’s order. Having\nconsidered the parties’ submissions and being duly advised, we granted the Commission’s\nmotion for transfer pursuant to Appellate Rule 56(A). Thus, the matter proceeded in this Court\nas if originally filed here. However, we denied the motion to stay the trial court’s order pending\nappeal.\n\n                                         Standard of Review\n\n          We review an administrative action using the guideposts set forth in Indiana’s\nAdministrative Orders and Procedures Act, under which we may set aside an agency’s action if it\nis: “(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2)\ncontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (3) in excess of statutory\njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; (4) without observance of\nprocedure required by law; or (5) unsupported by substantial evidence.” Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-\n14(d).\n\n          A party seeking judicial review bears the burden of proving the agency action is invalid\nfor one of the above reasons. Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(a). “Our review of agency action is\nintentionally limited, as we recognize an agency has expertise in its field and the public relies on\nits authority to govern in that area.” West v. Office of Indiana Sec'y of State, 54 N.E.3d 349,\n352–53 (Ind. 2016) (citing Ind. Wholesale Wine & Liquor Co. v. State ex rel. Ind. Alcoholic\nBeverage Comm'n, 695 N.E.2d 99, 105 (Ind. 1998)).             When reviewing a challenge to an\nadministrative agency’s decision, we will not try the facts de novo, nor substitute our own\njudgment for that of the agency. Jay Classroom Teachers Ass’n v. Jay Sch. Corp., 55 N.E.3d\n813, 816 (Ind. 2016) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Rather, we defer to the agency’s\nfindings if they are supported by substantial evidence. Id. (citing Ind. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v.\nWest, 838 N.E.2d 408, 415 (Ind. 2005)). On the other hand, an agency’s conclusions of law are\nordinarily reviewed de novo.       Id.   (citing Nat. Res. Def. Council v. Poet Biorefining–N.\nManchester, LLC, 15 N.E.3d 555, 561 (Ind. 2014)).\n\n                                                 4\n\f                                            Discussion\n\n       At issue is whether a privately held limited liability company may be granted a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit, pursuant to Title 7.1 of the Indiana Code, when it is wholly owned by\nanother company, which shares directors, officers, and all shareholders with the holder of a beer\nwholesaler’s permit. The Commission found the permittee, Spirited, ineligible for a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit, but the trial court reversed and ordered the permit be granted.            The\nCommission now argues that it properly relied on the plain language of relevant statutes in\nrejecting Spirited’s application.   Specifically, the Commission argues that Title 7.1 cannot\nplausibly be understood to allow Monarch, Spirited, EFT, and its overlapping ownership to hold\nor have interests in both liquor and beer wholesaler permits.\n\n       Spirited answers by asking us to uphold the trial court’s reversal of the Commission’s\ndenial. Spirited argues that the Commission’s unexplained departure from its own long-standing\nprecedent demonstrates that its denial was arbitrary and capricious. Nothing in the statute’s text,\naccording to Spirited, compels the Commission to deny a permit in the circumstances presented\nhere. Spirited also proposes alternative grounds on which we may affirm the trial court, which\ninclude impermissible political grounds for the denial and constitutional violations. We find\nnone of Spirited’s arguments for upholding the trial court’s order persuasive.\n\nI.         The Commission’s denial of Spirited’s application for a liquor wholesaler’s permit\n           conforms with statutory provisions in Title 7.1.\n\n       Our standard of review compels us to begin this analysis by first determining whether the\nstatute’s language can only be understood to mean something other than what the Commission\ndecided.     In other words, we ask whether the statute was clear on its face.           Here, the\nCommission’s interpretation of the relevant statute resulted in the denial of Spirited’s application\nfor a liquor wholesaler’s permit because Spirited was deemed ineligible by virtue of its interest\nin a beer wholesaler’s permit. We find that the statute is clear on its face and the Commission\nfollowed the statute’s unambiguous language.\n\n       Our goal in statutory interpretation is to determine and abide by the legislature’s intent.\nMoryl v. Ransone, 4 N.E.3d 1133, 1137 (Ind. 2014). In doing so, we aim “to determine and give\neffect to the intent of the legislature.” State v. Int’l Bus. Machs. Corp., 964 N.E.2d 206, 209\n\n                                                 5\n\f(Ind. 2012). “We start with the plain language of the statute, giving its words their ordinary\nmeaning and considering the structure of the statute as a whole.” West, 54 N.E.3d at 353. No\nword or part of the statute should be rendered meaningless if it can be reconciled with the rest of\nthe statute. Id. (citing Siwinski v. Town of Ogden Dunes, 949 N.E.2d 825, 828 (Ind. 2011)). As\nwe interpret the statute, we are mindful of both “what it ‘does say’ and what it ‘does not say.’”\nDay v. State, 57 N.E.3d 809, 812 (Ind. 2016) (quoting State v. Dugan, 793 N.E.2d 1034, 1036\n(Ind. 2003)). To the extent ambiguity exists, we determine and give effect to the intent of the\nlegislature as best it can be ascertained. ESPN, Inc. v. Univ. of Notre Dame Police Dep't, 62\nN.E.3d 1192, 1196 (Ind. 2016) (citing Moryl, 4 N.E.3d at 1137). We may not add new words to\na statute which are not the expressed intent of the legislature. Kitchell v. Franklin, 997 N.E.2d\n1020, 1026 (Ind. 2013).\n\n        In addition to our well-established statutory interpretation precedent, Indiana’s alcohol\nstatutes provide additional interpretive guidance. Specifically, Indiana Code section 7.1-1-2-1\ndirects us to construe the provisions of Title 7.1 “liberally . . . so as to effectuate the purposes of\n[the] title.”\n\n        Turning to the relevant statute, Indiana has an extensive statutory scheme regulating the\nmanufacture, sale, possession, and use of alcohol. See Ind. Code § 7.1-1-1-1 et seq. In fact,\nIndiana is not alone in such a scheme – following the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution, which repealed the federal prohibition on alcohol, states\nthroughout the country adopted a tiered system for regulating alcoholic beverages. Indiana’s\nscheme includes implementation of a three-tiered system. Our first tier consists of alcoholic\nbeverage manufacturers, which include brewers, vintners, and distillers. See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-\n2-7, 7.1-3-7-7, 7.1-3-12-5. These manufacturers produce alcoholic beverages and sell them to\nthe second tier of the scheme: the wholesalers. See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-3-5, 7.1-3-8-3, 7.1-3-13-\n6. Finally, the third tier is made up of retailers and dealers (e.g. package liquor stores, grocery\nstores, restaurants, and bars) who purchase from the wholesalers and sell directly to the\nconsumer. See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-4-6, 7.1-3-9-9, 7.1-3-14-4. This particular case involves only\nlicensing within the second tier – wholesaling.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       Title 7.1’s purposes include “[t]o protect the economic welfare, health, peace, and morals\nof the people of this State . . . [and] [t]o regulate and limit the manufacture, sale, possession, and\nuse of alcohol and alcoholic beverages.” Ind. Code § 7.1-1-1-1. The legislature accomplished\nthis goal, in part, by implementing both vertical and horizontal interest segregation via a\nselective issuance of permits. As to vertical integration restrictions, entities operating in one tier\nmay not, absent limited exceptions, hold an “interest” in a permit to operate in another tier. See\nInd. Code §§ 7.1-5-9-2, 7.1-5-9-4, 7.1-5-9-6 to 10. This restriction prevents what is known as\n“tied houses,” which are thought to promote a business culture of maximizing the sale of\nalcoholic beverages without regard for the impact such sales have on the public. The existing\nhorizontal integration restrictions, on the other hand, call for licenses or permits to be issued\nseparately within each tier for each of the three alcoholic beverages – beer, wine, and liquor. See\nInd. Code §§ 7.1-3-3-1; 7.1-3-8-1; 7.1-3-13-1.\n\n       Title 7.1 also contains a variety of other restrictions limiting relationships between permit\nholders. Unique to Indiana, and central to the issue at hand, Title 7.1 restricts a beer wholesaler\npermit holder’s ability to also hold an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and vice-versa.\nSpecifically, Indiana Code section 7.1-5-9-3(b), makes it “unlawful for the holder of a brewer’s\nor beer wholesaler’s permit to have an interest in a liquor permit of any type,” while Indiana\nCode section 7.1-5-9-6 makes it “unlawful for the holder of a distiller’s, rectifier’s, or liquor\nwholesaler’s permit to have an interest in a beer permit of any type.” These statutory restrictions\non permit holder relationships are referred to as “prohibited interest laws” by the parties.\nHenceforth, we shall do the same.\n\n       Pursuant to these prohibited interest laws, and in light of the links between Spirited and\nMonarch’s ownership, the Commission denied Spirited’s application for a liquor wholesaler’s\npermit. The Commission argues that its denial was appropriate because the statute’s plain\nlanguage calls upon the Commission to base its permitting decisions on the interests of natural\npersons, not just paper entities.       We are, thus, tasked with determining whether the\nCommission’s denial indeed conformed to the statute’s plain language.\n\n       As already mentioned, we think the pertinent statutes – namely sections 7.1-5-9-3(b) and\n7.1-5-9-6 of Title 7.1 – are clear on their face. These two sections unequivocally prohibit the\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fholder of a brewer’s or beer wholesaler’s permit from having an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s\npermit, and the reverse is also true.      That leaves two questions for us to resolve before\nproceeding with our analysis. First, we must answer who exactly is a permit “holder” under our\nfacts. And second, we must decide what constitutes an “interest.”\n\n       As to the first question, we find that in this case, the “holder” of a beer wholesaler’s\npermit can only be Monarch. The legislature did not define “holder,” but the statute’s plain\nlanguage convinces us that it simply refers to the entity to whom the permit is directly issued.\nAs read by this Court, a “holder” means the person or entity in possession of the permit. Thus\nSpirited, who was merely applying for a permit at the time of the denial, could not be considered\nthe holder of any permit. Likewise, EFT and its shareholders would not be deemed holders of a\npermit. A broader definition of holder – one in which stakeholders may also be deemed to be\nholders of a permit – would not make sense given provisions in other sections of the alcohol\nregulatory scheme. After all, Title 7.1 allows for the “holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit [to]\npurchase and import . . . and sell at wholesale, beer and flavored malt beverages.” Ind. Code §\n7.1-3-3-5. Surely, Monarch’s shareholders cannot, on their own, begin importing beer or malt\nbeverages to sell at wholesale by virtue of their stake in an entity that possesses a beer\nwholesaler’s permit.\n\n       As to the second question, we find the word “interest” has a broad scope, encompassing\nmore than just an entity that directly possesses the permit.           The legislature seemed to\nintentionally use “interest” instead of “holder” when it sought to achieve a broader prohibition.\nWe need not look further than the section in question to find an example where the legislature\nused the two terms in relation to one another. Indiana Code section 7.1-5-9-3 states that “it is\nunlawful for the holder of a . . . beer wholesaler’s permit to have an interest in a liquor permit of\nany type.” (emphasis added). For reference, we look at another provision where the legislature\nonly referred to an entity with an interest. In section 7.1-5-9-9, the legislature made it “unlawful\nfor a person who has an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s permit to . . . possess an interest of any\ntype in a liquor dealer’s or retailer’s permit.” (emphasis added). We find that the legislature\nthoughtfully chose to use the word “interest” in places where it wanted to express a much\nbroader prohibition than being in possession of a permit.\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f        In light of our broad construction of the word “interest,” and our finding that the language\nof the pertinent sections is clear on its face, we now turn to the Commission’s application of the\nstatute. The Commission found that granting Sprited’s application ran afoul of both sections 7.1-\n5-9-3(b) and 7.1-5-9-6. In doing so, the Commission looked into both Spirited and Monarch’s\nbusiness dealings – a function permitted by statutory language, which gives the Commission\npower to “ascertain the business relationships . . . between permittees [and] to regulate or\nprohibit a practice, relationship, or dealing by or between permittees, which in the judgment of\nthe [C]ommission is inimical to or a violation of a provision of [Title 7.1] . . .” Ind. Code § 7.1-\n2-3-22. The Commission also assessed whether said business dealings made granting Spirited’s\napplication either directly or indirectly hostile to, or in violation of, a Title 7.1 provision. In\nperforming the assessment, the Commission looked upward toward both Spirited and Monarch’s\nbusiness “family trees,” specifically delving into the nature of each entity’s ownership structure.\nSuch inquiry, we find, is permitted by section 7.1-2-3-22 and required for section 7.1-1-2-5,\nwhich provides that “whenever a person is prohibited from . . . holding a certain interest directly,\nhe shall be prohibited also from . . . holding that interest indirectly.”\n\n        Having reviewed the record, we agree with the Commission’s findings and hold that a\ndenial of Spirited’s application conformed to the plain language of the statute, which is clear on\nits face.   The business relationships between Spirited and Monarch first ran afoul of the\nprohibited interest statutes through Spirited’s sole member, EFT. Given section 7.1-1-2-5’s\nlanguage, EFT was expected to meet the same qualification requirements for a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit imposed on Spirited. In other words, EFT had to be clear of any prohibited\ninterests, whether directly or indirectly, such that granting Spirited’s permit would not violate\nany provision of Title 7.1.\n\n        Here, ties between EFT and Monarch were so extensive that EFT could reasonably be\ndeemed to hold an interest in a beer wholesaler’s permit – an interest prohibited by a combined\nreading of sections 7.1-5-9-6 and 7.1-1-2-5. Monarch was incorporated and began its operations\nin 1947. The record demonstrates that in 1996, Monarch’s management created EFT to take\nadvantage of certain favorable tax regulations. Since then, EFT has handled Monarch’s trucking\noperations as a “public for-hire fleet.” Appellee’s App. Vol. XIII at 192. EFT helps Monarch\ndistribute alcoholic beverages by receiving and warehousing products, managing inventory,\n\n                                                   9\n\fsorting and delivering, and collecting invoices. Monarch also sublets a facility from EFT, serves\nas EFT’s guarantor, is EFT’s primary customer, and is the source of almost all of EFT’s\nbusiness.    Additionally, Monarch and EFT share a CEO, a board of directors, and many\nemployees.    This was not just the case of two separate entities conducting close business\ntransactions. Here, the lines between Monarch and EFT were quite blurred, making a conclusion\nthat Monarch and EFT were practically one in the same a reasonable inference. Thus, given the\nextent of these ties, Spirited’s permit was barred by virtue of EFT’s interest in a beer\nwholesaler’s permit.\n\n       Likewise, Monarch and Spirited’s overlapping ownership also bars Spirited from\nobtaining the sought-after permit. It is undisputed that Spirited’s ownership consisted of a sole\nmember – EFT. EFT, itself a corporation, had a total of five shareholders representing a 100\npercent ownership stake in Monarch, the holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit.           As such,\nMonarch’s five-shareholders, whom pursuant to sections 7.1-3-21-5(c) and 7.1-1-2-5 were\nrequired to meet the same qualification requirements imposed on Monarch, would invariably\nhold an impermissible interest in Spirited’s liquor wholesaler’s permit if it were granted. Thus,\nthe Commission was also justified in denying Spirited the permit on this ground.\n\n       Ultimately, a broad construction of the statute’s provisions, as the legislature has guided\nus to perform, convinces us that the Commission’s denial of a liquor wholesaling permit\nconformed with the language in Title 7.1, which we find is clear on its face. We find that\nMonarch, as the holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit, was prohibited from holding an interest in\na liquor wholesaler’s permit. Likewise, a prospective liquor wholesaler’s permit holder like\nSpirited was prohibited from holding an interest in a beer wholesaler’s permit. In analyzing both\nSpirited and Monarch’s business organization “family tree,” the Commission reasonably\nconcluded that both sections 7.1-5-9-3 and 7.1-5-9-6 preclude it from granting a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit to Spirited. Without more, we cannot find that the Commission’s denial did\nnot conform with the language of 7.1, which we reiterate is clear on its face.\n\nII.     The Commission’s denial of Spirited’s application was neither arbitrary nor\n        capricious.\n       Spirited urges us to uphold the trial court’s reversal of the Commission’s denial because\nthe Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying Spirited’s application. Spirited\n\n                                                10\n\fmaintains that the Commission’s unexplained departure from its own precedent is proof that its\ndenial was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree.\n\n       In addition to our standard of review, which allows a reviewing court to set aside an\nagency’s decision where it is deemed arbitrary and capricious, Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(d), Title\n7.1 further provides relief from Commission decisions that are made arbitrarily and capriciously.\nWhere an applicant for a wholesaler’s permit is aggrieved by a denial of a wholesaler’s permit,\nthe applicant may secure a review of the Commission’s determination by appealing to the\nMarion Superior Court, which may reverse if the denial was made on arbitrary, capricious, or\npolitical grounds. Ind. Code § 7.1-3-23-31. A decision is deemed arbitrary and capricious when\nit is “patently unreasonable and is made without consideration of the facts and in total disregard\nof the circumstances. . . .” A.B. v. State, 949 N.E.2d 1204, 1217 (Ind. 2011) (internal quotations\nomitted). Such a decision will also lack any basis which might lead a reasonable person to the\nsame conclusion. Id. In other words, “[a]n action of an administrative agency is arbitrary and\ncapricious only where there is no reasonable basis for the action.” Breitweiser v. Ind. Office of\nEnvtl. Adjudication, 810 N.E.2d 699, 702 (Ind. 2004).\n\n       As already discussed, the Commission’s denial was grounded in statutory language that is\nclear on its face, therefore it cannot be said that there was no reasonable basis for the action.\nSpirited’s permit was denied because Title 7.1 prohibits the holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit\nfrom holding an interest in a liquor wholesale permit, and vice versa. In assessing Spirited’s\nvarious business relationships, the Commission determined that the overlap in ownership\nbetween Monarch and Spirited would be such that Spirited’s sole member, EFT, would hold an\ninterest in both a beer wholesaling permit and a liquor wholesaling permit if Spirited were to be\ngranted the permit. That determination was justified in light of our reading of the pertinent Title\n7.1 provisions.\n\n       Furthermore, the Commission’s supposed unexplained departure from its own precedent\nhas no bearing on whether the denial was arbitrary and capricious. In Equicor Dev., Inc. v.\nWestfield-Washington Twp. Plan Comm’n., we plainly held that prior inconsistent actions are\nirrelevant. 758 N.E.2d 34, 38 (Ind. 2001). Our Court found that “[i]f the basis for denial is a\nfailure to meet a requirement of the governing ordinance, albeit one previously enforced laxly or\nnot at all, the inquiry is not whether there are prior inconsistent decisions, but rather whether\n\n                                                11\n\fthere is substantial evidence supporting the agency’s decision.” Id. at 38-39 (emphasis added).\nHere, the Commission simply did what the alcohol statutes required it to do, and there was\nsubstantial evidence to support that decision. Under our Equicor holding, such action cannot be\nsaid to be arbitrary and capricious.\n\nIII.   This Court is not persuaded to affirm the trial court on any of the alternative\n       theories Spirited proposes.\n       As an alternative to its argument that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously,\nSpirited offers three separate theories on which we may affirm the trial court’s order. We find\nnone of these theories sufficiently persuasive so as to convince us to uphold the trial court’s\nreversal. To the extent necessary, we now address Spirited’s three final arguments.\n\n       a. The Commission’s denial was not based on “political grounds.”\n\n       Spirited first urges us to find that the Commission unlawfully denied the permit\napplication based on “political grounds,” in violation of Indiana Code section 7.1-3-23-30.\nSection 7.1-3-23-30 prohibits the Commission from “deny[ing], fail[ing] to renew, or revok[ing]\na wholesaler’s permit of any type on arbitrary, capricious, or political grounds.” In reversing the\nCommission’s denial of Spirited’s permit, the trial court made factual findings in support of its\nconclusion that the Commission’s denial was impermissibly based on political grounds. Among\nother things, the trial court made factual findings that Monarch was a “disfavored” wholesaler,\nthat the governor’s office interfered with permit applications it associated with Monarch, and that\nMonarch and Spirited’s competitors engaged in ex parte communications with the Commission\nand the governor’s office. In response, the Commission argues that “political grounds” has a\nnarrow meaning, which includes denials based only on “patronage” or “political affiliation” –\nneither of which occurred here. The Commission also argues that, even if we find the meaning\nof “political grounds” is not as narrow as it proposes, the trial court’s factual findings do not\nsupport the conclusion that political grounds were the basis for the Commission’s denial.\n\n       We’re persuaded by the Commission’s second argument; the trial court’s factual findings\nfail to demonstrate that the Commission’s decision was made on political grounds of any kind.\nWhile the trial court cites communications from a 2009 proceeding involving EFT, those\nproceedings occurred under a gubernatorial administration other than the one in control when\nSpirited’s permit was denied.      Furthermore, most of the key people involved in the 2009\n\n                                                12\n\fcommunications were no longer with the governor’s office by the time the application was filed\nin 2013. By the time the Commission voted on Spirited’s application in January 2015, the\nExecutive Secretary was new and only one commissioner remained from the prior\nadministration. Nothing in the record strikes us as supporting a finding that political grounds\ninduced the Commission to deny the permit.\n\n       b. The denial does not violate Indiana’s Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n\n       Next, Spirited proposes that we find the Commission’s differential treatment violated the\nEqual Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Indiana Constitution. The Commission urges us\nto find Spirited’s claim is barred by res judicata, but we’re not convinced such a bar exists here.\nRes judicata applies when “a particular issue is adjudicated and then put in issue in a subsequent\nsuit on a different cause of action between the same parties or their privies.” McClanahan v.\nRemington Freight Line, Inc., 517 N.E.2d 390, 394 (Ind. 1988). In Cook, 48 N.E.3d at 325,\nMonarch raised an Equal Privileges and Immunities claim, but that claim was not the same one\nwe see here. Whereas in Cook, a “facial” challenge was raised, irrespective of the parties and\nspecific circumstances, here the challenge is “as applied” and is based on the allegation that the\nCommission respected corporate separateness in some cases, but did not do so in this particular\ncase. We find this argument is new.\n\n       However, the argument, nonetheless, fails on its merits.         The Equal Privileges and\nImmunities Clause can be violated in two ways.            First, when disparate treatment is not\n“reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes.”\nMyers v. Crouse-Hinds Div. of Cooper Indus., Inc., 53 N.E.3d 1160, 1165 (Ind. 2016). And\nsecond, when preferential treatment is not “uniformly applicable and equally available to all\npersons similarly situated.” Id. Spirited alleges a violation of only the second prong. Although\nwe agree that the Commission engaged in preferential treatment by recognizing corporate\nseparateness for some companies, but not for others, a review of prior Commission decisions\noutlined by Spirited reveals that none of the entities involved in prior decisions were similarly\nsituated to Spirited. As compared to the other entities, Spirited is a distinct type of business, had\nseparate licensing requirements, and provides different services. These distinctions convince us\nthat no Equal Privileges and Immunities violation occurred here.\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       c. Spirited fails to show that the Commission’s denial violates the Due Process Clause\n          of either the U.S. or Indiana Constitutions.\n       We disagree with Spirited’s claim that the Due Process Clauses of the United States and\nIndiana Constitutions were violated. Spirited argues that once the State creates a statutory\nentitlement to a hearing, as Indiana did here, due process requires that it be fair. See Ind. Code\n§§ 7.1-3-23-32, 7.1-3-23-33. Even accepting Spirited’s premise, we find the hearing Spirited\nwas afforded was fair.\n\n       Spirited’s claim of procedural due process deficiency is merely a rehashing of its claim\nthat the Commission’s denial was arbitrary and capricious, and that the denial was based on\npolitical grounds. We have already addressed those claims, concluding that the Commission’s\ndenial was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and we further found that the denial was not based on\npolitical grounds. Therefore, Spirited’s argument that irregularities in the process deprived it of\na fair hearing is without merit.\n\n       To the extent Spirited also argues it has a due process claim arising from the permit itself,\nthis claim also fails. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the standard elements of a due\nprocess claim include whether the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of a cognizable property or\nliberty interest, and whether any such deprivation occurred without due process. Morrissey v.\nBrewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972). “To establish a protectable property interest, a plaintiff must\nbe able to point to a substantive state-law predicate creating that interest.” Omosegbon v. Wells,\n335 F.3d 668, 674 (7th Cir. 2003). “The interest must be more than de minimis, which typically\ncalls on the plaintiff to demonstrate some form of provable pecuniary harm.” Id. Our own Court\nhas echoed the federal courts in that “[t]o have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly\nmust have more than an abstract need or desire for it. He must have more than a unilateral\nexpectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Commissioner\nof Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles v. Vawter, 45 N.E.3d 1200, 1210 (2015) (quoting Bd. Of\nRegents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).\n\n       Under such guidance, Spirited cannot claim that it has an interest in the permit because\npermittees have no property right in any permit the Commission issues. Ind. Code § 7.1-3-1-2\n(providing that “[a] permitee shall have no property right in a wholesaler’s, retailer’s, or dealer’s\npermit of any type”). In other words, no inherent property right in a liquor permit exists because\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fthe issuance or revocation of such permit is within the power of the Legislature to prescribe.\nState ex rel. Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Comm'n v. Superior Court of Marion Cty., 233 Ind.\n563, 565, 122 N.E.2d 9, 10 (1954).\n\n       Given that we find no irregularities in the process afforded to Spirited, and we otherwise\nfind Spirited has no cognizable property interest in a permit, we need not explore Spirited’s\nconstitutional claims further.\n\n       In sum, because none of the alternative theories Spirited proposes compel us to uphold\nthe trial court’s reversal, we decide this issue based on our finding that the Commission’s denial\nwas tethered to the mandates of the statute’s unambiguous language and nothing else.\n\n                                           Conclusion\n\n       The Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution authorizes States to\nregulate the production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages. There can be no doubt that\nIndiana is empowered to do what the Commission has urged here – which is to bar companies\nwith same ultimate owners from simultaneously holding both beer and liquor-wholesaler\npermits. However, over the years, Indiana’s alcohol code has become diluted, reflecting many\npolicy choices and resulting amendments, dating back to the 1930s.\n\n       Nonetheless, we have not measured any public policy considerations or assessed the\nefficacy of prohibited interest laws on the goals outlined by the statute – doing so would be\ninappropriate. We recognize that businesses have long lobbied this very contentious point before\nour General Assembly, and will likely continue to do so, but deciding whether the regulatory\nscheme in place is still relevant or still necessary or in need of overhaul are matters to be\nresolved through the political process, which we trust would take into account the policy\narguments made by opposing sides on this issue.\n\n       As for today’s decision, it rests purely on our interpretation of the statute’s language,\nwhich we believe is clear on its face. We hold the Commission’s denial conformed with the\nclear and unambiguous language of the statute. We further hold that the Commission did not act\narbitrarily or capriciously in initially denying the applicant’s request. Finally, we hold that the\nCommission’s denial was not based on political grounds and we decline Spirited’s invitation to\n\n                                                15\n\faffirm the trial court on constitutional grounds. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court’s order\ndirecting the Commission to issue the applicant a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and we reinstate the\nCommission’s order denying the permit.\n\n\nRush, C.J., and Slaughter, J., concur.\n\nMassa, J., not participating.\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f",

Monarch Beverage Co.\nv. Cook, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328 (Ind. Ct. App. 2015).                Within each tier, licenses are issued\nseparately for beer1, wine2, and liquor3. Among the many “interest restrictions” outlined in\nIndiana’s regulatory scheme, a pair of provisions prohibiting the holder of a beer wholesaler’s\npermit from having an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and vice-versa, are at issue here.\n\n        In September 2013, Spirited Sales, LLC (“Spirited”), an aspiring liquor wholesaler,\napplied to the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission for a liquor wholesaler’s permit.\nSpirited is registered in Delaware as a limited liability company. It is wholly owned by a parent\ncompany called E.F. Transit, Inc. (“EFT”), which transports beer, wine, and liquor throughout\n\n\n\n1\n  See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-2-1; 7.1-3-3-1; 7.1-3-4-1.\n2\n  See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-12-1; 7.1-3-13-1; 7.1-3-14-1.\n3\n  See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-7-1; 7.1-3-8-1; 7.1-3-9-1.\n\n                                                         2\n\fthe state. EFT’s ownership consists of five shareholders4. The same five shareholders also\nwholly own Monarch Beverage Company, Inc. (“Monarch”), an Indiana company that holds a\nbeer and wine wholesaler’s permit.\n\n        On December 16, 2014, after holding a public hearing at Spirited’s request, the\nCommission’s Executive Secretary, acting as hearing judge, issued findings of fact and\nconclusions of law, recommending that Spirited’s application be denied. The recommendation\nnoted that, despite some separation of business formalities, EFT and Monarch “operated as the\nsame company” and further found that a liquor wholesaler like Spirited, “entering into a contract\nwith EFT, would in reality be entering into a contract with Monarch.” Appellee's App. Vol. IX\nat 172. On January 20, 2015, the Commission adopted the proposed findings and conclusions,\nthus denying Spirited’s application.\n\n        Spirited then filed a petition in Marion Superior Court seeking judicial review of the\nCommission’s denial under the Administrative Orders and Procedures Act, Indiana Code Section\n4-21.5-5-1 et seq., and the alcoholic beverages permitting statute, Indiana Code section 7.1-3-23-\n30. On August 24, 2016, the trial court issued an order granting Spirited’s petition. The trial\ncourt order set aside the Commission’s order denying the permit and it directed the Commission\nto issue Spirited a liquor wholesaler’s permit. The trial court found that, in light of previous\nCommission decisions that cited to the corporate separateness doctrine in support of granting a\npermit to businesses whose owners held interests prohibited by statute, the Commission’s denial\nof Spirited’s application for a liquor wholesaler’s permit was arbitrary and capricious. The trial\ncourt also found that Spirited’s other arguments were consequently moot and did not warrant\nbeing addressed.\n\n        The Commission then filed a Notice of Appeal and moved the trial court to stay its order,\npending appeal. After briefing and a hearing, the trial court denied the stay motion on September\n23, 2016. To avoid any risk of contempt, the Commission issued Spirited a letter of authority\nthat same day, and then issued the permit on September 28, 2016. Thereafter, the Commission\n\n\n\n4\n EFT’s five shareholders are: 1) the Edwin T. French, Jr. Marital Trust, 2) the 2000 Irrevocable Monarch Trust for\nEdwin T. French III, 3) the 2000 Irrevocable Monarch Trust for Gail Anne French Pheffer, 4) Edwin T. French III,\nand 5) Gail Anne French Pheffer.\n\n                                                        3\n\fsought a stay from the Court of Appeals, which was summarily denied on October 25, 2016 by a\ndivided panel.\n\n          On October 31, 2016, the Commission filed motions seeking: 1) emergency transfer to\nthis Court, pursuant to Appellate Rule 56(A), and 2) a stay of the trial court’s order. Having\nconsidered the parties’ submissions and being duly advised, we granted the Commission’s\nmotion for transfer pursuant to Appellate Rule 56(A). Thus, the matter proceeded in this Court\nas if originally filed here. However, we denied the motion to stay the trial court’s order pending\nappeal.\n\n                                         Standard of Review\n\n          We review an administrative action using the guideposts set forth in Indiana’s\nAdministrative Orders and Procedures Act, under which we may set aside an agency’s action if it\nis: “(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2)\ncontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; (3) in excess of statutory\njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right; (4) without observance of\nprocedure required by law; or (5) unsupported by substantial evidence.” Ind.

The Commission found the permittee, Spirited, ineligible for a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit, but the trial court reversed and ordered the permit be granted.            The\nCommission now argues that it properly relied on the plain language of relevant statutes in\nrejecting Spirited’s application.   Specifically, the Commission argues that Title 7.1 cannot\nplausibly be understood to allow Monarch, Spirited, EFT, and its overlapping ownership to hold\nor have interests in both liquor and beer wholesaler permits.\n\n       Spirited answers by asking us to uphold the trial court’s reversal of the Commission’s\ndenial. Spirited argues that the Commission’s unexplained departure from its own long-standing\nprecedent demonstrates that its denial was arbitrary and capricious. Nothing in the statute’s text,\naccording to Spirited, compels the Commission to deny a permit in the circumstances presented\nhere. Spirited also proposes alternative grounds on which we may affirm the trial court, which\ninclude impermissible political grounds for the denial and constitutional violations. We find\nnone of Spirited’s arguments for upholding the trial court’s order persuasive.\n\nI.         The Commission’s denial of Spirited’s application for a liquor wholesaler’s permit\n           conforms with statutory provisions in Title 7.1.\n\n       Our standard of review compels us to begin this analysis by first determining whether the\nstatute’s language can only be understood to mean something other than what the Commission\ndecided.     In other words, we ask whether the statute was clear on its face.           Here, the\nCommission’s interpretation of the relevant statute resulted in the denial of Spirited’s application\nfor a liquor wholesaler’s permit because Spirited was deemed ineligible by virtue of its interest\nin a beer wholesaler’s permit. We find that the statute is clear on its face and the Commission\nfollowed the statute’s unambiguous language.\n\n       Our goal in statutory interpretation is to determine and abide by the legislature’s intent.\nMoryl v.

Specifically, Indiana Code section 7.1-1-2-1\ndirects us to construe the provisions of Title 7.1 “liberally . . . so as to effectuate the purposes of\n[the] title.”\n\n        Turning to the relevant statute, Indiana has an extensive statutory scheme regulating the\nmanufacture, sale, possession, and use of alcohol. See Ind. Code § 7.1-1-1-1 et seq. In fact,\nIndiana is not alone in such a scheme – following the passage of the Twenty-First Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution, which repealed the federal prohibition on alcohol, states\nthroughout the country adopted a tiered system for regulating alcoholic beverages. Indiana’s\nscheme includes implementation of a three-tiered system. Our first tier consists of alcoholic\nbeverage manufacturers, which include brewers, vintners, and distillers. See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-\n2-7, 7.1-3-7-7, 7.1-3-12-5. These manufacturers produce alcoholic beverages and sell them to\nthe second tier of the scheme: the wholesalers. See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-3-5, 7.1-3-8-3, 7.1-3-13-\n6. Finally, the third tier is made up of retailers and dealers (e.g. package liquor stores, grocery\nstores, restaurants, and bars) who purchase from the wholesalers and sell directly to the\nconsumer. See Ind. Code §§ 7.1-3-4-6, 7.1-3-9-9, 7.1-3-14-4. This particular case involves only\nlicensing within the second tier – wholesaling.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       Title 7.1’s purposes include “[t]o protect the economic welfare, health, peace, and morals\nof the people of this State . . . [and] [t]o regulate and limit the manufacture, sale, possession, and\nuse of alcohol and alcoholic beverages.” Ind. Code § 7.1-1-1-1. The legislature accomplished\nthis goal, in part, by implementing both vertical and horizontal interest segregation via a\nselective issuance of permits. As to vertical integration restrictions, entities operating in one tier\nmay not, absent limited exceptions, hold an “interest” in a permit to operate in another tier. See\nInd. Code §§ 7.1-5-9-2, 7.1-5-9-4, 7.1-5-9-6 to 10. This restriction prevents what is known as\n“tied houses,” which are thought to promote a business culture of maximizing the sale of\nalcoholic beverages without regard for the impact such sales have on the public. The existing\nhorizontal integration restrictions, on the other hand, call for licenses or permits to be issued\nseparately within each tier for each of the three alcoholic beverages – beer, wine, and liquor. See\nInd. Code §§ 7.1-3-3-1; 7.1-3-8-1; 7.1-3-13-1.\n\n       Title 7.1 also contains a variety of other restrictions limiting relationships between permit\nholders. Unique to Indiana, and central to the issue at hand, Title 7.1 restricts a beer wholesaler\npermit holder’s ability to also hold an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and vice-versa.\nSpecifically, Indiana Code section 7.1-5-9-3(b), makes it “unlawful for the holder of a brewer’s\nor beer wholesaler’s permit to have an interest in a liquor permit of any type,” while Indiana\nCode section 7.1-5-9-6 makes it “unlawful for the holder of a distiller’s, rectifier’s, or liquor\nwholesaler’s permit to have an interest in a beer permit of any type.” These statutory restrictions\non permit holder relationships are referred to as “prohibited interest laws” by the parties.\nHenceforth, we shall do the same.\n\n       Pursuant to these prohibited interest laws, and in light of the links between Spirited and\nMonarch’s ownership, the Commission denied Spirited’s application for a liquor wholesaler’s\npermit. The Commission argues that its denial was appropriate because the statute’s plain\nlanguage calls upon the Commission to base its permitting decisions on the interests of natural\npersons, not just paper entities.       We are, thus, tasked with determining whether the\nCommission’s denial indeed conformed to the statute’s plain language.\n\n       As already mentioned, we think the pertinent statutes – namely sections 7.1-5-9-3(b) and\n7.1-5-9-6 of Title 7.1 – are clear on their face. These two sections unequivocally prohibit the\n\n\n                                                  7\n\fholder of a brewer’s or beer wholesaler’s permit from having an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s\npermit, and the reverse is also true.      That leaves two questions for us to resolve before\nproceeding with our analysis. First, we must answer who exactly is a permit “holder” under our\nfacts. And second, we must decide what constitutes an “interest.”\n\n       As to the first question, we find that in this case, the “holder” of a beer wholesaler’s\npermit can only be Monarch. The legislature did not define “holder,” but the statute’s plain\nlanguage convinces us that it simply refers to the entity to whom the permit is directly issued.\nAs read by this Court, a “holder” means the person or entity in possession of the permit. Thus\nSpirited, who was merely applying for a permit at the time of the denial, could not be considered\nthe holder of any permit. Likewise, EFT and its shareholders would not be deemed holders of a\npermit. A broader definition of holder – one in which stakeholders may also be deemed to be\nholders of a permit – would not make sense given provisions in other sections of the alcohol\nregulatory scheme. After all, Title 7.1 allows for the “holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit [to]\npurchase and import . . . and sell at wholesale, beer and flavored malt beverages.” Ind. Code §\n7.1-3-3-5. Surely, Monarch’s shareholders cannot, on their own, begin importing beer or malt\nbeverages to sell at wholesale by virtue of their stake in an entity that possesses a beer\nwholesaler’s permit.\n\n       As to the second question, we find the word “interest” has a broad scope, encompassing\nmore than just an entity that directly possesses the permit.           The legislature seemed to\nintentionally use “interest” instead of “holder” when it sought to achieve a broader prohibition.\nWe need not look further than the section in question to find an example where the legislature\nused the two terms in relation to one another. Indiana Code section 7.1-5-9-3 states that “it is\nunlawful for the holder of a . . . beer wholesaler’s permit to have an interest in a liquor permit of\nany type.” (emphasis added). For reference, we look at another provision where the legislature\nonly referred to an entity with an interest. In section 7.1-5-9-9, the legislature made it “unlawful\nfor a person who has an interest in a liquor wholesaler’s permit to . . . possess an interest of any\ntype in a liquor dealer’s or retailer’s permit.” (emphasis added). We find that the legislature\nthoughtfully chose to use the word “interest” in places where it wanted to express a much\nbroader prohibition than being in possession of a permit.\n\n\n\n                                                 8\n\f        In light of our broad construction of the word “interest,” and our finding that the language\nof the pertinent sections is clear on its face, we now turn to the Commission’s application of the\nstatute. The Commission found that granting Sprited’s application ran afoul of both sections 7.1-\n5-9-3(b) and 7.1-5-9-6. In doing so, the Commission looked into both Spirited and Monarch’s\nbusiness dealings – a function permitted by statutory language, which gives the Commission\npower to “ascertain the business relationships . . . between permittees [and] to regulate or\nprohibit a practice, relationship, or dealing by or between permittees, which in the judgment of\nthe [C]ommission is inimical to or a violation of a provision of [Title 7.1] . . .” Ind. Code § 7.1-\n2-3-22. The Commission also assessed whether said business dealings made granting Spirited’s\napplication either directly or indirectly hostile to, or in violation of, a Title 7.1 provision. In\nperforming the assessment, the Commission looked upward toward both Spirited and Monarch’s\nbusiness “family trees,” specifically delving into the nature of each entity’s ownership structure.\nSuch inquiry, we find, is permitted by section 7.1-2-3-22 and required for section 7.1-1-2-5,\nwhich provides that “whenever a person is prohibited from . . . holding a certain interest directly,\nhe shall be prohibited also from . . . holding that interest indirectly.”\n\n        Having reviewed the record, we agree with the Commission’s findings and hold that a\ndenial of Spirited’s application conformed to the plain language of the statute, which is clear on\nits face.   The business relationships between Spirited and Monarch first ran afoul of the\nprohibited interest statutes through Spirited’s sole member, EFT. Given section 7.1-1-2-5’s\nlanguage, EFT was expected to meet the same qualification requirements for a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit imposed on Spirited. In other words, EFT had to be clear of any prohibited\ninterests, whether directly or indirectly, such that granting Spirited’s permit would not violate\nany provision of Title 7.1.\n\n        Here, ties between EFT and Monarch were so extensive that EFT could reasonably be\ndeemed to hold an interest in a beer wholesaler’s permit – an interest prohibited by a combined\nreading of sections 7.1-5-9-6 and 7.1-1-2-5. Monarch was incorporated and began its operations\nin 1947. The record demonstrates that in 1996, Monarch’s management created EFT to take\nadvantage of certain favorable tax regulations. Since then, EFT has handled Monarch’s trucking\noperations as a “public for-hire fleet.” Appellee’s App. Vol. XIII at 192. EFT helps Monarch\ndistribute alcoholic beverages by receiving and warehousing products, managing inventory,\n\n                                                   9\n\fsorting and delivering, and collecting invoices. Monarch also sublets a facility from EFT, serves\nas EFT’s guarantor, is EFT’s primary customer, and is the source of almost all of EFT’s\nbusiness.    Additionally, Monarch and EFT share a CEO, a board of directors, and many\nemployees.    This was not just the case of two separate entities conducting close business\ntransactions. Here, the lines between Monarch and EFT were quite blurred, making a conclusion\nthat Monarch and EFT were practically one in the same a reasonable inference. Thus, given the\nextent of these ties, Spirited’s permit was barred by virtue of EFT’s interest in a beer\nwholesaler’s permit.\n\n       Likewise, Monarch and Spirited’s overlapping ownership also bars Spirited from\nobtaining the sought-after permit. It is undisputed that Spirited’s ownership consisted of a sole\nmember – EFT. EFT, itself a corporation, had a total of five shareholders representing a 100\npercent ownership stake in Monarch, the holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit.           As such,\nMonarch’s five-shareholders, whom pursuant to sections 7.1-3-21-5(c) and 7.1-1-2-5 were\nrequired to meet the same qualification requirements imposed on Monarch, would invariably\nhold an impermissible interest in Spirited’s liquor wholesaler’s permit if it were granted. Thus,\nthe Commission was also justified in denying Spirited the permit on this ground.\n\n       Ultimately, a broad construction of the statute’s provisions, as the legislature has guided\nus to perform, convinces us that the Commission’s denial of a liquor wholesaling permit\nconformed with the language in Title 7.1, which we find is clear on its face. We find that\nMonarch, as the holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit, was prohibited from holding an interest in\na liquor wholesaler’s permit. Likewise, a prospective liquor wholesaler’s permit holder like\nSpirited was prohibited from holding an interest in a beer wholesaler’s permit. In analyzing both\nSpirited and Monarch’s business organization “family tree,” the Commission reasonably\nconcluded that both sections 7.1-5-9-3 and 7.1-5-9-6 preclude it from granting a liquor\nwholesaler’s permit to Spirited. Without more, we cannot find that the Commission’s denial did\nnot conform with the language of 7.1, which we reiterate is clear on its face.\n\nII.     The Commission’s denial of Spirited’s application was neither arbitrary nor\n        capricious.\n       Spirited urges us to uphold the trial court’s reversal of the Commission’s denial because\nthe Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying Spirited’s application. Spirited\n\n                                                10\n\fmaintains that the Commission’s unexplained departure from its own precedent is proof that its\ndenial was arbitrary and capricious. We disagree.\n\n       In addition to our standard of review, which allows a reviewing court to set aside an\nagency’s decision where it is deemed arbitrary and capricious, Ind. Code § 4-21.5-5-14(d), Title\n7.1 further provides relief from Commission decisions that are made arbitrarily and capriciously.\nWhere an applicant for a wholesaler’s permit is aggrieved by a denial of a wholesaler’s permit,\nthe applicant may secure a review of the Commission’s determination by appealing to the\nMarion Superior Court, which may reverse if the denial was made on arbitrary, capricious, or\npolitical grounds. Ind. Code § 7.1-3-23-31. A decision is deemed arbitrary and capricious when\nit is “patently unreasonable and is made without consideration of the facts and in total disregard\nof the circumstances. . . .” A.B. v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2523441\"><a href=\"/opinion/2523441/ab-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1217 (Ind. 2011) (internal quotations\nomitted). Such a decision will also lack any basis which might lead a reasonable person to the\nsame conclusion. Id. In other words, “[a]n action of an administrative agency is arbitrary and\ncapricious only where there is no reasonable basis for the action.” Breitweiser v. Ind. Office of\nEnvtl. Adjudication, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"852895\"><a href=\"/opinion/852895/breitweiser-v-indiana-office-of-environmental-adjudication/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (Ind. 2004).\n\n       As already discussed, the Commission’s denial was grounded in statutory language that is\nclear on its face, therefore it cannot be said that there was no reasonable basis for the action.\nSpirited’s permit was denied because Title 7.1 prohibits the holder of a beer wholesaler’s permit\nfrom holding an interest in a liquor wholesale permit, and vice versa. In assessing Spirited’s\nvarious business relationships, the Commission determined that the overlap in ownership\nbetween Monarch and Spirited would be such that Spirited’s sole member, EFT, would hold an\ninterest in both a beer wholesaling permit and a liquor wholesaling permit if Spirited were to be\ngranted the permit. That determination was justified in light of our reading of the pertinent Title\n7.1 provisions.\n\n       Furthermore, the Commission’s supposed unexplained departure from its own precedent\nhas no bearing on whether the denial was arbitrary and capricious. In Equicor Dev., Inc. v.\nWestfield-Washington Twp. Plan Comm’n., we plainly held that prior inconsistent actions are\nirrelevant. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853289\"><a href=\"/opinion/853289/equicor-dev-inc-v-westfield-washington-tp-plan-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (Ind. 2001). Our Court found that “[i]f the basis for denial is a\nfailure to meet a requirement of the governing ordinance, albeit one previously enforced laxly or\nnot at all, the inquiry is not whether there are prior inconsistent decisions, but rather whether\n\n                                                11\n\fthere is substantial evidence supporting the agency’s decision.” Id. at 38-39 (emphasis added).\nHere, the Commission simply did what the alcohol statutes required it to do, and there was\nsubstantial evidence to support that decision. Under our Equicor holding, such action cannot be\nsaid to be arbitrary and capricious.\n\nIII.   This Court is not persuaded to affirm the trial court on any of the alternative\n       theories Spirited proposes.\n       As an alternative to its argument that the Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously,\nSpirited offers three separate theories on which we may affirm the trial court’s order. We find\nnone of these theories sufficiently persuasive so as to convince us to uphold the trial court’s\nreversal. To the extent necessary, we now address Spirited’s three final arguments.\n\n       a. The Commission’s denial was not based on “political grounds.”\n\n       Spirited first urges us to find that the Commission unlawfully denied the permit\napplication based on “political grounds,” in violation of Indiana Code section 7.1-3-23-30.\nSection 7.1-3-23-30 prohibits the Commission from “deny[ing], fail[ing] to renew, or revok[ing]\na wholesaler’s permit of any type on arbitrary, capricious, or political grounds.” In reversing the\nCommission’s denial of Spirited’s permit, the trial court made factual findings in support of its\nconclusion that the Commission’s denial was impermissibly based on political grounds. Among\nother things, the trial court made factual findings that Monarch was a “disfavored” wholesaler,\nthat the governor’s office interfered with permit applications it associated with Monarch, and that\nMonarch and Spirited’s competitors engaged in ex parte communications with the Commission\nand the governor’s office. In response, the Commission argues that “political grounds” has a\nnarrow meaning, which includes denials based only on “patronage” or “political affiliation” –\nneither of which occurred here. The Commission also argues that, even if we find the meaning\nof “political grounds” is not as narrow as it proposes, the trial court’s factual findings do not\nsupport the conclusion that political grounds were the basis for the Commission’s denial.\n\n       We’re persuaded by the Commission’s second argument; the trial court’s factual findings\nfail to demonstrate that the Commission’s decision was made on political grounds of any kind.\nWhile the trial court cites communications from a 2009 proceeding involving EFT, those\nproceedings occurred under a gubernatorial administration other than the one in control when\nSpirited’s permit was denied.      Furthermore, most of the key people involved in the 2009\n\n                                                12\n\fcommunications were no longer with the governor’s office by the time the application was filed\nin 2013. By the time the Commission voted on Spirited’s application in January 2015, the\nExecutive Secretary was new and only one commissioner remained from the prior\nadministration. Nothing in the record strikes us as supporting a finding that political grounds\ninduced the Commission to deny the permit.\n\n       b. The denial does not violate Indiana’s Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause.\n\n       Next, Spirited proposes that we find the Commission’s differential treatment violated the\nEqual Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Indiana Constitution. The Commission urges us\nto find Spirited’s claim is barred by res judicata, but we’re not convinced such a bar exists here.\nRes judicata applies when “a particular issue is adjudicated and then put in issue in a subsequent\nsuit on a different cause of action between the same parties or their privies.” McClanahan v.\nRemington Freight Line, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2097690\"><a href=\"/opinion/2097690/mcclanahan-v-remington-freight-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (Ind. 1988). In Cook, 48 N.E.3d at 325,\nMonarch raised an Equal Privileges and Immunities claim, but that claim was not the same one\nwe see here. Whereas in Cook, a “facial” challenge was raised, irrespective of the parties and\nspecific circumstances, here the challenge is “as applied” and is based on the allegation that the\nCommission respected corporate separateness in some cases, but did not do so in this particular\ncase. We find this argument is new.\n\n       However, the argument, nonetheless, fails on its merits.         The Equal Privileges and\nImmunities Clause can be violated in two ways.            First, when disparate treatment is not\n“reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes.”\nMyers v. Crouse-Hinds Div. of Cooper Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1165 (Ind. 2016). And\nsecond, when preferential treatment is not “uniformly applicable and equally available to all\npersons similarly situated.” Id. Spirited alleges a violation of only the second prong. Although\nwe agree that the Commission engaged in preferential treatment by recognizing corporate\nseparateness for some companies, but not for others, a review of prior Commission decisions\noutlined by Spirited reveals that none of the entities involved in prior decisions were similarly\nsituated to Spirited. As compared to the other entities, Spirited is a distinct type of business, had\nseparate licensing requirements, and provides different services. These distinctions convince us\nthat no Equal Privileges and Immunities violation occurred here.\n\n\n\n                                                 13\n\f       c. Spirited fails to show that the Commission’s denial violates the Due Process Clause\n          of either the U.S. or Indiana Constitutions.\n       We disagree with Spirited’s claim that the Due Process Clauses of the United States and\nIndiana Constitutions were violated. Spirited argues that once the State creates a statutory\nentitlement to a hearing, as Indiana did here, due process requires that it be fair. See Ind. Code\n§§ 7.1-3-23-32, 7.1-3-23-33. Even accepting Spirited’s premise, we find the hearing Spirited\nwas afforded was fair.\n\n       Spirited’s claim of procedural due process deficiency is merely a rehashing of its claim\nthat the Commission’s denial was arbitrary and capricious, and that the denial was based on\npolitical grounds. We have already addressed those claims, concluding that the Commission’s\ndenial was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and we further found that the denial was not based on\npolitical grounds. Therefore, Spirited’s argument that irregularities in the process deprived it of\na fair hearing is without merit.\n\n       To the extent Spirited also argues it has a due process claim arising from the permit itself,\nthis claim also fails. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the standard elements of a due\nprocess claim include whether the plaintiff suffered a deprivation of a cognizable property or\nliberty interest, and whether any such deprivation occurred without due process.

He must have more than a unilateral\nexpectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.” Commissioner\nof Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles v.

Ind. Code § 7.1-3-1-2\n(providing that “[a] permitee shall have no property right in a wholesaler’s, retailer’s, or dealer’s\npermit of any type”). In other words, no inherent property right in a liquor permit exists because\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fthe issuance or revocation of such permit is within the power of the Legislature to prescribe.\nState ex rel.

There can be no doubt that\nIndiana is empowered to do what the Commission has urged here – which is to bar companies\nwith same ultimate owners from simultaneously holding both beer and liquor-wholesaler\npermits. However, over the years, Indiana’s alcohol code has become diluted, reflecting many\npolicy choices and resulting amendments, dating back to the 1930s.\n\n       Nonetheless, we have not measured any public policy considerations or assessed the\nefficacy of prohibited interest laws on the goals outlined by the statute – doing so would be\ninappropriate. We recognize that businesses have long lobbied this very contentious point before\nour General Assembly, and will likely continue to do so, but deciding whether the regulatory\nscheme in place is still relevant or still necessary or in need of overhaul are matters to be\nresolved through the political process, which we trust would take into account the policy\narguments made by opposing sides on this issue.\n\n       As for today’s decision, it rests purely on our interpretation of the statute’s language,\nwhich we believe is clear on its face. We hold the Commission’s denial conformed with the\nclear and unambiguous language of the statute. We further hold that the Commission did not act\narbitrarily or capriciously in initially denying the applicant’s request. Finally, we hold that the\nCommission’s denial was not based on political grounds and we decline Spirited’s invitation to\n\n                                                15\n\faffirm the trial court on constitutional grounds. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court’s order\ndirecting the Commission to issue the applicant a liquor wholesaler’s permit, and we reinstate the\nCommission’s order denying the permit.\n\n\nRush, C.J., and Slaughter, J., concur.\n\nMassa, J., not participating.\n\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\f</pre>",
