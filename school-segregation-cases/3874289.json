HEADNOTES ARE NOT AN OFFICIAL PRODUCT OF THE COURT, THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT DISPLAYED.] <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 307</span> \nThe Cincinnati City School District, appellant, appeals from the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, which affirmed the State Board of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 308</span> \nEducation's order transferring territory from the Cincinnati City School District to the Madeira City School District. We affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p>The Ken Arbre subdivision, consisting of forty-eight homes, is located entirely within the city of Madeira but is part of the Cincinnati City School District. On March 29, 1992, residents of the subdivision submitted a petition pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> requesting that the subdivision be transferred to the Madeira City School District. The residents presented evidence that they were being denied full participation in their community, that their children were being denied access to programs in the city of Madeira because they were not enrolled in Madeira schools, and that transit time to Madeira schools would be substantially less than transit time to the assigned Cincinnati schools. Appellant opposed the transfer, arguing, among other things, that the transfer of the mostly white subdivision would increase racial isolation in appellant's schools. After a hearing on October 7, 1993, a State Board of Education referee<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> recommended that the board deny the transfer.</p>\n<p>In considering a transfer petition, the referee must consider the answers of the transferee and transferor school districts to the seventeen questions listed in Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-02</cross_reference>(B). Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(A). The referee must also consider the ten factors listed in Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B). The referee in this case found that all but two of the questions and factors favored the transfer:</p>\n<p>\"[I]t appears that all factors with the exception [of] racial isolation implications and potential financial implications would point to approving the transfer. * * *</p>\n<p>\"[I]t is recommended that the financial consequences and racial impact of the proposed transfer necessitate that Petitioner's request be denied.\"</p>\n<p>The referee found that the transfer would cost appellant $70,000 to $75,000, or about 0.026 percent of its $291 million budget. The referee also found that none of the subdivision's fourteen school-age children attended any of appellant's schools, except one child who attended an alternative Cincinnati school and was scheduled to graduate in 1994. Three school-age children from the subdivision were home-schooled. The referee found that minorities constituted 64.7942 percent of the students in the Cincinnati City School District and 3.6882 percent of the students in the Madeira City School District. The minority enrollment in the three Cincinnati schools assigned to the Ken Arbre subdivision was 84.1, 80.48, and 75.64 percent, respectively. Relying on Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B)(5) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 309</span> \n(\"The transfer shall not cause, preserve, or increase racial isolation\"), the referee recommended that the board deny the transfer because the percentage of minorities in appellant's schools would rise or stay the same after the transfer.</p>\n<p>The State Board of Education rejected the recommendation and approved the transfer on July 12, 1994, finding that the negative effect on the racial balance of appellant's schools would be de minimis and that the transfer was \"in the best interests of the school-age pupils most directly affected by the transfer.\" Appellant appealed pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>119.12</cross_reference> to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. On August 16, 1994, the parties filed a joint stipulation suspending the transfer pending determination of the appeal. The court of common pleas failed to rule on appellant's motion to admit evidence of two other mostly white territories seeking transfers out of the Cincinnati City School District. On August 24, 1995, the court issued its decision affirming the board's resolution, finding that the board's conclusion that the transfer was in the best interests of the pupils and would have a de minimis effect on racial isolation was in accordance with law and supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court also held that appellant did not have standing to raise an equal protection argument and that even if it did, the transfer order did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>Appellant now asserts one assignment of error: \"The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant-appellant by ruling that the transfer of territory is in accordance with law.\" Appellant alleges three errors of law: (1) because the transfer preserves or increases racial isolation, the transfer violates Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B)(5); (2) the transfer violates the Equal Protection Clause; and (3) the court of common pleas erred in failing to admit evidence of two other requests for transfer of territory.<sup id=\"ref-fn2\"><a href=\"#fn2\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>A resolution of the State Board of Education pursuant to an R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> transfer request is appealable under R.C. <cross_reference>119.12</cross_reference>.<em>Rossford Exempted Village School Dist. v.

Code <cross_reference>3301-89-01</cross_reference>(A). Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 3301-89 contains four sections setting forth rules to be followed by school districts, the State Board of Education, the Department of Education, and referees appointed by the Department of Education. Under Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-01</cross_reference>, which is addressed to the State Board of Education, the board must give primary consideration to the present and ultimate good of the pupils:</p>\n<p>\"General policies of the state board of education in a request for transfer of territory under section <cross_reference>3311.06</cross_reference> or<cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> of the Revised Code</p>\n<p>\"* * *</p>\n<p>\"(F) A request for transfer of territory will be considered upon its merit with primary consideration given to the present and ultimate good of the pupils concerned.\" Ohio Adm. Code<cross_reference>3301-89-01</cross_reference>(F).</p>\n<p>Because the good of the pupils must be the primary consideration of the board, by definition no other single factor may be determinative of the transfer request.</p>\n<p>\"[T]he several factors for consideration set forth in Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-02</cross_reference>(B) and <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B) are intended to be an integral part of the board's transfer decision with primary consideration given to the present and ultimate good of all the students who are affected by the proposed transfer.</p>\n<p>\"* * *</p>\n<p>\"[I]t is appropriate for the board to consider both the social and educational needs of all affected students, as well as the potential financial implications of a transfer.

Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference> was to give needed guidance to the referee appointed to assist the board in making its determination. Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference> need not be read as creating a \"veto factor\" abrogating the board's duty under Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-01</cross_reference>(F) to give primary consideration to the present and ultimate good of the pupils. The board was within its discretion to interpret Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B) as not binding the board's discretion based on a single factor. Therefore, the court of common pleas did not abuse its discretion by deferring to this reasonable interpretation of the authoring agency.</p>\n<p>Appellant asserts that the transfer of the Ken Arbre subdivision violates the Equal Protection Clause. The court of common pleas held that because appellant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 313</span> \nis a political subdivision of the state of Ohio, it does not have standing to invoke the protection provided by the United States Constitution against its own state. The court stated that even assuming that appellant has standing to challenge the state board's order on equal protection grounds, the order does not violate the Equal Protection Clause.<sup id=\"ref-fn4\"><a href=\"#fn4\">4</a></sup></p>\n<p>The doctrine of standing in federal court is based on both the limitation on federal court jurisdiction embodied in the case-or-controversy requirement of Clause 1, Section 2, Article<cross_reference>III</cross_reference>, United States Constitution and prudential limitations on the exercise of that jurisdiction. <em>Warth v. Seldin</em> (1975),<cross_reference>422 U.S. 490</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>498</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>95 S.Ct. 2197</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>2205</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>45 L.Ed.2d 343</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>354</cross_reference>;<em>Assn. of Data Processing Serv.

All three cases are distinguishable and not determinative of the issue of standing in this case.</p>\n<p>In <em>Avon Lake,</em> two school districts challenged the public utility tax assessments made by the tax commissioner against two utility companies. The school districts argued that the statutory scheme for appealing final determinations of the tax commissioner violated the procedural due process protections of the <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment. <em>Avon Lake,</em> <cross_reference>35 Ohio St.3d at 120</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>518 N.E.2d at 1191-1192</cross_reference>. The court held that political subdivisions may not rely upon the protections of the <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment to challenge the constitutionality of state legislation. \"A political subdivision, such as a school district, receives no protection from the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses vis-a-vis its creating state.\" <em>Id.</em> at 122, <cross_reference>518 N.E.2d at 1193</cross_reference>. This case is different because appellant is not arguing that it has <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment rights that would be violated by the transfer of the Ken Arbre subdivision. Rather, appellant is arguing that the transfer would cause appellant to violate the<cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment rights of its students.</p>\n<p>In <em>Harrell,</em> two citizens sought transfer pursuant to R.C.<cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> of two small parcels from the Streetsboro City School District to the Kent City School District. The court of appeals issued writs of mandamus commanding the Streetsboro City School District to deliver the citizens' petitions to the State Board of Education in conformity with R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference>(A). The school district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 315</span> \nappealed, arguing that R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> violates the Equal Protection Clause because the rules for citizen-initiated transfers pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> are different from those for transfers pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>3311.22</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>3311.231</cross_reference>. <em>Harrell,</em><cross_reference>46 Ohio St.3d at 62-63</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>544 N.E.2d at 931-932</cross_reference>. The court held that the Streetsboro school district lacked standing to raise the equal protection rights of the electors in its district:</p>\n<p>\"Streetsboro [City School District] is not one of the qualified electors that it claims are the victims of these purportedly irrational classifications. Since Streetsboro is not a member of the class it identifies, it lacks standing to attack the statute's constitutionality on the ground that it violates others' rights to equal protection.\" <em>Id.</em> at 63,<cross_reference>544 N.E.2d at 932</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p><em>Harrell</em> is distinguishable from this case in that the Streetsboro school district was challenging the authority of the General Assembly to establish rules by which citizens can initiate a transfer. The Streetsboro school district was raising the rights of electors to initiate a transfer. Here, appellant is challenging a resolution of the state board that would allegedly force appellant to violate the equal protection rights of its students. Appellant is raising the rights of its students in an effort to block a transfer. Third-party standing is the exception rather than the rule, and the exception applies in this case because of the relationship between the school district and its students. That relationship was not implicated by the Streetsboro school district's allegation that there was no rational basis for the General Assembly establishing different rules for initiating different types of transfers.</p>\n<p><em>In re Transfer of Territory from Streetsboro City School</em><em>Dist.</em> was a subsequent appeal in the <em>Harrell</em> action. After the Streetsboro City School District forwarded the petitions to the State Board of Education, the State Board of Education approved the transfer, and the court of common pleas affirmed. On appeal, the Streetsboro City School District argued that R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference>\nwas unconstitutional because it denied equal protection to those residents of the district who opposed the transfer because the statute permits transfer without either a popular vote or notice to all voters. <em>In re Transfer of Territory from Streetsboro City</em><em>School Dist.</em> (June 11, 1992), Franklin App. No. 91AP-1405, unreported, at 9, 1992 WL 132457. This court quoted <em>Avon Lake</em> for the general rule that a political subdivision may not invoke against its own state the protections of the United States Constitution and noted that the nature of the Streetsboro school district's equal protection argument was the same as that advanced in <em>Harrell.</em> We also acknowledged that third-party standing may be appropriate in some circumstances, such as<em>Akron Bd. of Edn., supra.</em> As illustrated by the federal cases cited above, a school district raising the equal protection rights of its students is one of those circumstances. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 316</span> </p>\n<p>We conclude that appellant has standing to raise the argument that the state board's resolution approving the transfer of the Ken Arbre subdivision violates the equal protection rights of its students.</p>\n<p>Although appellant has standing to assert its equal protection argument, we agree with the court of common pleas that appellant did not prove that the transfer would violate the Equal Protection Clause. The only pertinent evidence in the record is the percentage racial composition of the two districts and the territory. The only other material available to the court of common pleas or to this court is the reported 1984 opinion of the federal district court announcing the consent decree and the text of an October 26, 1993 settlement agreement, which purports to replace the 1984 consent decree. The lack of evidence in the record is reflected in the brevity with which appellant discusses the issue in its brief. Appellant states in conclusory fashion that the transfer will violate the Equal Protection Clause. The only authority appellant cites is a two-page memorandum and one-page judgment entry from 1973 out of the United States District Court in Cincinnati, in which the court rendered its judgment that an order of the State Board of Education ordering a transfer of territory from the Cincinnati City School District violated the Equal Protection Clause. Based solely on this memorandum and judgment entry, appellant asserts that any transfer of a largely white neighborhood out of the largely minority Cincinnati City School District would violate the Equal Protection Clause. We disagree. The fact that such a transfer could violate the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that every such transfer violates the Equal Protection Clause. The finding of a federal court twenty-three years ago that a proposed transfer from the Cincinnati City School District would violate the Equal Protection Clause does not create a rule of law that such a transfer is prohibited in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the proposed splitting of a school district that was sixty-six percent black into two districts, one fifty-two percent black, one seventy-two percent black, the United States Supreme Court said that mere disparity in numbers did not constitute an equal protection violation:</p>\n<p>\"We need not and do not hold that this disparity in the racial composition of the two systems would be a sufficient reason, standing alone, to enjoin the creation of the separate school district. The fact that a school board's desegregation plan leaves some disparity in racial balance among various schools in the system does not alone make that plan unacceptable.\" <em>Wright v.

The additional evidence proffered by appellant included an R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> transfer request dated March 31, 1994, and an April 4, 1994 letter from the assistant superintendent of public instruction for the State Department of Education to the superintendent of the Cincinnati City School District acknowledging an R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> request for transfer of territory from the Cincinnati City School District to the Forest Hills Local School District. Appellant contends that this evidence is relevant to illustrate the potential domino effect of approval of this transfer. Appellant filed its motion for admission of additional evidence on September 2, 1994, and all parties submitted memoranda. The court of common pleas rendered its decision August 24, 1995 without ruling on the motion.</p>\n<p>R.C. <cross_reference>119.12</cross_reference> provides that, unless otherwise provided by law, additional evidence &#8212; that is, evidence beyond that in the record certified by the agency &#8212; may be admitted by the court of common pleas only when it is newly discovered and could not with reasonable diligence have been ascertained prior to the administrative hearing:</p>\n<p>\"Unless otherwise provided by law, the court may grant a request for the admission of additional evidence when satisfied that such additional evidence is newly discovered and could not with reasonable diligence have been ascertained prior to the hearing before the agency.\" R.C. <cross_reference>119.12</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The decision to admit additional evidence lies within the discretion of the court of common pleas, but only after the court has determined that the evidence is newly discovered and that it could not with reasonable diligence have been ascertained prior to the agency hearing. <em>Ganley, Inc. v.

We affirm for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p>The Ken Arbre subdivision, consisting of forty-eight homes, is located entirely within the city of Madeira but is part of the Cincinnati City School District. On March 29, 1992, residents of the subdivision submitted a petition pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> requesting that the subdivision be transferred to the Madeira City School District. The residents presented evidence that they were being denied full participation in their community, that their children were being denied access to programs in the city of Madeira because they were not enrolled in Madeira schools, and that transit time to Madeira schools would be substantially less than transit time to the assigned Cincinnati schools. Appellant opposed the transfer, arguing, among other things, that the transfer of the mostly white subdivision would increase racial isolation in appellant's schools. After a hearing on October 7, 1993, a State Board of Education referee<sup id=\"ref-fn1\"><a href=\"#fn1\">1</a></sup> recommended that the board deny the transfer.</p>\n<p>In considering a transfer petition, the referee must consider the answers of the transferee and transferor school districts to the seventeen questions listed in Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-02</cross_reference>(B). Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(A). The referee must also consider the ten factors listed in Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B). The referee in this case found that all but two of the questions and factors favored the transfer:</p>\n<p>\"[I]t appears that all factors with the exception [of] racial isolation implications and potential financial implications would point to approving the transfer. * * *</p>\n<p>\"[I]t is recommended that the financial consequences and racial impact of the proposed transfer necessitate that Petitioner's request be denied.\"</p>\n<p>The referee found that the transfer would cost appellant $70,000 to $75,000, or about 0.026 percent of its $291 million budget. The referee also found that none of the subdivision's fourteen school-age children attended any of appellant's schools, except one child who attended an alternative Cincinnati school and was scheduled to graduate in 1994. Three school-age children from the subdivision were home-schooled. The referee found that minorities constituted 64.7942 percent of the students in the Cincinnati City School District and 3.6882 percent of the students in the Madeira City School District. The minority enrollment in the three Cincinnati schools assigned to the Ken Arbre subdivision was 84.1, 80.48, and 75.64 percent, respectively. Relying on Ohio Adm. Code <cross_reference>3301-89-03</cross_reference>(B)(5) <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 309</span> \n(\"The transfer shall not cause, preserve, or increase racial isolation\"), the referee recommended that the board deny the transfer because the percentage of minorities in appellant's schools would rise or stay the same after the transfer.</p>\n<p>The State Board of Education rejected the recommendation and approved the transfer on July 12, 1994, finding that the negative effect on the racial balance of appellant's schools would be de minimis and that the transfer was \"in the best interests of the school-age pupils most directly affected by the transfer.\" Appellant appealed pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>119.12</cross_reference> to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. On August 16, 1994, the parties filed a joint stipulation suspending the transfer pending determination of the appeal. The court of common pleas failed to rule on appellant's motion to admit evidence of two other mostly white territories seeking transfers out of the Cincinnati City School District. On August 24, 1995, the court issued its decision affirming the board's resolution, finding that the board's conclusion that the transfer was in the best interests of the pupils and would have a de minimis effect on racial isolation was in accordance with law and supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The court also held that appellant did not have standing to raise an equal protection argument and that even if it did, the transfer order did not violate the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p>Appellant now asserts one assignment of error: \"The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellant-appellant by ruling that the transfer of territory is in accordance with law.\" Appellant alleges three errors of law: (1) because the transfer preserves or increases racial isolation, the transfer violates Ohio Adm.

All three cases are distinguishable and not determinative of the issue of standing in this case.</p>\n<p>In <em>Avon Lake,</em> two school districts challenged the public utility tax assessments made by the tax commissioner against two utility companies. The school districts argued that the statutory scheme for appealing final determinations of the tax commissioner violated the procedural due process protections of the <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment. <em>Avon Lake,</em> <cross_reference>35 Ohio St.3d at 120</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>518 N.E.2d at 1191-1192</cross_reference>. The court held that political subdivisions may not rely upon the protections of the <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment to challenge the constitutionality of state legislation. \"A political subdivision, such as a school district, receives no protection from the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses vis-a-vis its creating state.\" <em>Id.</em> at 122, <cross_reference>518 N.E.2d at 1193</cross_reference>. This case is different because appellant is not arguing that it has <cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment rights that would be violated by the transfer of the Ken Arbre subdivision. Rather, appellant is arguing that the transfer would cause appellant to violate the<cross_reference>Fourteenth</cross_reference> Amendment rights of its students.</p>\n<p>In <em>Harrell,</em> two citizens sought transfer pursuant to R.C.<cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> of two small parcels from the Streetsboro City School District to the Kent City School District. The court of appeals issued writs of mandamus commanding the Streetsboro City School District to deliver the citizens' petitions to the State Board of Education in conformity with R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference>(A). The school district <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 315</span> \nappealed, arguing that R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> violates the Equal Protection Clause because the rules for citizen-initiated transfers pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> are different from those for transfers pursuant to R.C. <cross_reference>3311.22</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>3311.231</cross_reference>. <em>Harrell,</em><cross_reference>46 Ohio St.3d at 62-63</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>544 N.E.2d at 931-932</cross_reference>. The court held that the Streetsboro school district lacked standing to raise the equal protection rights of the electors in its district:</p>\n<p>\"Streetsboro [City School District] is not one of the qualified electors that it claims are the victims of these purportedly irrational classifications. Since Streetsboro is not a member of the class it identifies, it lacks standing to attack the statute's constitutionality on the ground that it violates others' rights to equal protection.\" <em>Id.</em> at 63,<cross_reference>544 N.E.2d at 932</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p><em>Harrell</em> is distinguishable from this case in that the Streetsboro school district was challenging the authority of the General Assembly to establish rules by which citizens can initiate a transfer. The Streetsboro school district was raising the rights of electors to initiate a transfer. Here, appellant is challenging a resolution of the state board that would allegedly force appellant to violate the equal protection rights of its students. Appellant is raising the rights of its students in an effort to block a transfer. Third-party standing is the exception rather than the rule, and the exception applies in this case because of the relationship between the school district and its students. That relationship was not implicated by the Streetsboro school district's allegation that there was no rational basis for the General Assembly establishing different rules for initiating different types of transfers.</p>\n<p><em>In re Transfer of Territory from Streetsboro City School</em><em>Dist.</em> was a subsequent appeal in the <em>Harrell</em> action. After the Streetsboro City School District forwarded the petitions to the State Board of Education, the State Board of Education approved the transfer, and the court of common pleas affirmed. On appeal, the Streetsboro City School District argued that R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference>\nwas unconstitutional because it denied equal protection to those residents of the district who opposed the transfer because the statute permits transfer without either a popular vote or notice to all voters. <em>In re Transfer of Territory from Streetsboro City</em><em>School Dist.</em> (June 11, 1992), Franklin App. No. 91AP-1405, unreported, at 9, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">132457</span></span>. This court quoted <em>Avon Lake</em> for the general rule that a political subdivision may not invoke against its own state the protections of the United States Constitution and noted that the nature of the Streetsboro school district's equal protection argument was the same as that advanced in <em>Harrell.</em> We also acknowledged that third-party standing may be appropriate in some circumstances, such as<em>Akron Bd. of Edn., supra.</em> As illustrated by the federal cases cited above, a school district raising the equal protection rights of its students is one of those circumstances. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 316</span> </p>\n<p>We conclude that appellant has standing to raise the argument that the state board's resolution approving the transfer of the Ken Arbre subdivision violates the equal protection rights of its students.</p>\n<p>Although appellant has standing to assert its equal protection argument, we agree with the court of common pleas that appellant did not prove that the transfer would violate the Equal Protection Clause. The only pertinent evidence in the record is the percentage racial composition of the two districts and the territory. The only other material available to the court of common pleas or to this court is the reported 1984 opinion of the federal district court announcing the consent decree and the text of an October 26, 1993 settlement agreement, which purports to replace the 1984 consent decree. The lack of evidence in the record is reflected in the brevity with which appellant discusses the issue in its brief. Appellant states in conclusory fashion that the transfer will violate the Equal Protection Clause. The only authority appellant cites is a two-page memorandum and one-page judgment entry from 1973 out of the United States District Court in Cincinnati, in which the court rendered its judgment that an order of the State Board of Education ordering a transfer of territory from the Cincinnati City School District violated the Equal Protection Clause. Based solely on this memorandum and judgment entry, appellant asserts that any transfer of a largely white neighborhood out of the largely minority Cincinnati City School District would violate the Equal Protection Clause. We disagree. The fact that such a transfer could violate the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that every such transfer violates the Equal Protection Clause. The finding of a federal court twenty-three years ago that a proposed transfer from the Cincinnati City School District would violate the Equal Protection Clause does not create a rule of law that such a transfer is prohibited in perpetuity.</p>\n<p>In reviewing the proposed splitting of a school district that was sixty-six percent black into two districts, one fifty-two percent black, one seventy-two percent black, the United States Supreme Court said that mere disparity in numbers did not constitute an equal protection violation:</p>\n<p>\"We need not and do not hold that this disparity in the racial composition of the two systems would be a sufficient reason, standing alone, to enjoin the creation of the separate school district. The fact that a school board's desegregation plan leaves some disparity in racial balance among various schools in the system does not alone make that plan unacceptable.\" <em>Wright v.

The additional evidence proffered by appellant included an R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> transfer request dated March 31, 1994, and an April 4, 1994 letter from the assistant superintendent of public instruction for the State Department of Education to the superintendent of the Cincinnati City School District acknowledging an R.C. <cross_reference>3311.24</cross_reference> request for transfer of territory from the Cincinnati City School District to the Forest Hills Local School District. Appellant contends that this evidence is relevant to illustrate the potential domino effect of approval of this transfer. Appellant filed its motion for admission of additional evidence on September 2, 1994, and all parties submitted memoranda.
