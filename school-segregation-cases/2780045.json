(\"MPG\"), sued Appellees, Crosstex CCNG\r\nMarketing, Ltd., Crosstex Energy Services, L.P., and Crosstex Energy Services, G.P.,\r\nL.L.C. (collectively \"Crosstex\"), for breach of contract, fraud, and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation.  The trial court granted a combined traditional and no-evidence motion\r\nfor summary judgment in favor of Crosstex on the breach of contract claim, and a no-evidence motion for summary judgment in favor of Crosstex on fraud and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation claims.  In two issues, MPG contends the trial court erred in: (1) granting\r\nCrosstex's traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment on the breach of\r\ncontract claim; and (2) granting Crosstex's no-evidence summary judgment on the\r\nremaining claims.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCrosstex is the owner and operator of a natural gas pipeline that crosses MPG's\r\nleasehold.  MPG and Crosstex entered negotiations whereby Crosstex would buy 100%\r\nof the natural gas produced by MPG's well.  MPG and Crosstex signed a \"letter agreement\"\r\ndated March 12, 2003, stating that MPG would build a flow line from its well to Crosstex's\r\nGregory Gathering System.  MPG later decided that the flowline would be too expensive\r\nto do this.  As a result, Crosstex and MPG developed a new plan whereby the natural gas\r\nwould be delivered directly to Crosstex's newly-acquired Ingleside-to-Refugio eight-inch\r\npipeline that crossed MPG's leasehold.  MPG and Crosstex memorialized the new plan in\r\na second letter agreement, dated April 10, 2003.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe April 10, 2003 letter agreement stated that MPG would commit 100% of its\r\nnatural gas output from the well.  MPG would construct flow lines to deliver the gas from\r\nthe well to the \"agreed upon points of interconnection ('Points of Delivery') between the</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>facilities of MPG and Crosstex.\"<sup> (1)</sup>  MPG would also be financially responsible for the\r\npurchase and installation of the required fittings, valves, and measuring equipment at a\r\ncost of $12,500.   The agreement also outlined the term, price, and gas quality\r\nspecification.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the April 10, 2003 letter agreement, MPG and Crosstex continued to negotiate\r\nthe measuring equipment's location and the flow line's specifications.  The negotiations\r\nincluded a field meeting in mid-May 2003, whereby the parties met to discuss the exact\r\nlocation of the measuring equipment.  Negotiations continued into September 2003 to\r\nidentify the measuring equipment's location.  The parties were not able to agree on a\r\nlocation.  The formal contract mentioned in the letter agreement was never signed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn April 6, 2004, approximately seven months after negotiations ceased, MPG filed\r\nsuit.  The trial court granted a hybrid traditional and no-evidence summary judgment on the\r\nbreach of contract claim, and a no-evidence summary judgment on the fraud and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation claims on June 21, 2005. <strong>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. Traditional Summary Judgment Standard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>The function of a summary judgment is to eliminate patently unmeritorious claims\r\nand defenses, not to deprive litigants of the right to a jury trial.  <em>City of Houston v. Clear\r\nCreek Basin Auth.</em>, 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 n. 5 (Tex. 1979).  We review <em>de novo </em>a trial\r\ncourt's order granting a traditional motion for summary judgment.  <em>Joe v. Two Thirty-Nine\r\nJoint Venture</em>, 145 S.W.3d 150, 156 (Tex. 2004).  The traditional summary judgment\r\nmovant has the burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that\r\nit is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); <em>Nixon v. Mr. Prop.\r\nMgmt. Co.</em>, 690 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tex. 1985).  As defendant, Crosstex is entitled to\r\nsummary judgment if it conclusively negated an essential element of MPG's breach of\r\ncontract cause of action.  <em>S.W. Elec. Power Co. v. Grant</em>, 73 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex. 2002). \r\nCrosstex bears the burden of proof and all doubts about the existence of a genuine issue\r\nof material fact are resolved against it.  <em>See</em> <em>Nixon</em>, 690 S.W.2d at 548-49.  All evidence\r\nand any reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to MPG.  <em>Id</em>.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. No-Evidence Summary Judgment Standard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA no-evidence motion for summary judgment is equivalent to a pretrial directed\r\nverdict, and this court applies the same legal sufficiency standard of review.  <em>Ortega v. City\r\nNat'l Bank</em>, 97 S.W.3d 765, 772 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.) (op. on reh'g). \r\nIn an appeal of a no-evidence summary judgment, this Court reviews the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, disregarding all contrary evidence and inferences. \r\n<em>Merrill Dow Pharms., Inc. v. Harner</em>, 953 S.W.2d 706, 711 (Tex. 1997).  We review a no-evidence summary judgment <em>de novo</em>.  <em>Id</em>.  If the nonmovant produces evidence that raises\r\na genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is improper.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). \r\nAll that is required of the nonmovant is to produce a scintilla of probative evidence to raise\r\na genuine issue of material fact.  <em>Ortega</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 772.  There is less than a scintilla\r\nof evidence when the evidence is \"so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise\r\nor suspicion\" of a fact.  <em>King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman</em>, 118 S.W.3d 742, 751 (Tex. 2003). \r\nThere is more than a scintilla of evidence when the evidence allows reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.  <em>Id</em>.  The burden of producing evidence is\r\nentirely on the non-movant; the movant has no burden to attach any evidence to the\r\nmotion.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo-evidence points will be sustained when: (a) there is a complete absence of\r\nevidence of a vital fact; (b) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving\r\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (c) the evidence offered to prove\r\na vital fact is no more than a scintilla; or (d) the evidence conclusively establishes the\r\nopposite of a vital fact.  <em>King Ranch</em>, 118 S.W.3d at 751.  When the trial court does not\r\nspecify the basis upon which it granted summary judgment, the appellate court must affirm\r\nif any one of the movant's theories has merit.  <em>Star-Telegram, Inc. v. Doe</em>, 915 S.W.2d 471,\r\n473 (Tex. 1995).      <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>III. DISCUSSION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. Breach of Contract Claim</strong>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first cause of action, MPG alleges that Crosstex breached the April 10, 2003\r\nletter agreement.  Crosstex moved for a hybrid traditional and no-evidence summary\r\njudgment against MPG's breach of contract claim on the following grounds: (1) there was\r\nno meeting of the minds as to the point of delivery (points of interconnection), an essential\r\nelement of the contract; (2) there was a lack of consideration; and (3) MPG was not injured\r\nby the alleged breach.  Crosstex's motion was not clearly segregated into traditional and\r\nno-evidence summary judgment grounds.  MPG, however, did not lodge an exception to\r\nany ambiguity in the motion.  <em>See</em> <em>McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 858 S.W.2d\r\n337, 342-43 (Tex. 1993).  The trial court granted summary judgment, but did not specify\r\nwhether its grant pertained to the traditional motion, the no-evidence motion, or both.  We\r\nmust, therefore, analyze the no-evidence summary judgment first, followed by the\r\ntraditional summary judgment.  <em>See</em> <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway</em>, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600\r\n(Tex. 2004).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn general, a contract is legally binding only if its terms are sufficiently definite to\r\nenable a court to understand the parties' obligations.  <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City\r\nof Fort Worth</em>, 22 S.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000).  The Restatement asserts that contract\r\nterms are reasonably certain \"if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a\r\nbreach and for giving an appropriate remedy.\"  Restatement (Second) of Contracts ¬ß\r\n33(2) (1981).  Of the several elements required for a legally binding contract, two important\r\nelements are that the parties (1) have a meeting of the minds and (2) communicate\r\nconsent to the terms of the agreement.  <em>Smith v. Renz</em>, 840 S.W.2d 702, 704 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 1992, writ denied).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhether an agreement fails for indefiniteness is a question of law to be determined\r\nby the court.  <em>See T.O. Stanley Boot Co., Inc.  v. Bank of El Paso</em>, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221\r\n(Tex. 1992).  A binding contract may be formed if the parties agree on the material terms,\r\neven if they leave other provisions for later negotiation.  <em>Scott v. Ingle Bros. Pac., Inc.</em>, 489\r\nS.W.2d 554, 556 (Tex. 1972) (citing 1 Corbin on Contracts (1963) 87-91).  Where a\r\ncontract leaves essential terms open for future negotiation and adjustment, there is no\r\nbinding contract that can be enforced.  <em>See T.O. Stanley Boot</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 221;\r\n<em>Engelman Irrigation Dist. v. Shields Bros.</em>, 960 S.W.2d 343, 352 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi\r\n1997, pet. denied).  Texas courts favor validating transactions rather than voiding them,\r\nbut courts may not create a contract where none exists and they generally may not add,\r\nalter, or eliminate essential terms.  <em>Oakrock Exploration Co v. Killam</em>, 87 S.W.3d 685, 690\r\n(Tex. App.-San Antonio 2002, pet. denied).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA letter agreement may be binding even though it refers to the drafting of a future,\r\nmore formal agreement.  <em>See</em> <em>Foreca, S.A. v. GRD Dev. Co., Inc.</em>, 758 S.W.2d 744, 746\r\n(Tex. 1988).   But an agreement to make a future contract is enforceable only if it is\r\n\"specific as to all essential terms, and no terms of the proposed agreement may be left to\r\nfuture negotiations.\"  <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 846 (quoting <em>Foster v.\r\nWagner</em>, 343 S.W.2d 914, 920-21 (Tex. App.-El Paso 1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).  It is well\r\nsettled law that an agreement that leaves material matters open for future adjustment and\r\nagreement that never occur, is not binding upon the parties and merely constitutes an\r\nagreement to agree.  <em>Id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe April 10, 2003 letter agreement left the delivery point open for future\r\nnegotiation.  The letter agreement states the point of delivery to be \"at the agreed upon\r\npoints of interconnection (Points of Delivery) between the facilities of MPG and Crosstex.\" \r\nCrosstex contends in its summary judgment motion that point-of-delivery is an essential\r\nterm in a gas purchase agreement.  MPG does not dispute this point, but contends that the\r\nletter agreement sufficiently described the point of delivery.  We disagree.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t The letter agreement, by its very terms, left the point of delivery up to future\r\nnegotiation.  The letter agreement was not specific as to all essential terms because it left\r\nthe point of delivery to future negotiations.  <em>See</em> <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 22 S.W.3d\r\nat 846.  Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to MPG, we find that the April\r\n10, 2003 letter agreement was an unenforceable agreement to agree.  The trial court\r\nproperly granted no-evidence summary judgment.  Because resolution of this issue on no-evidence grounds is dispositive, we need not address the traditional summary judgment\r\ngrounds.  <em>See Ridgway</em>, 135 S.W.3d 598 at 600; Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.  We overrule MPG's\r\nfirst issue.  <strong>B. Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs a preliminary matter, MPG complains on appeal that because there was not\r\nadequate time for discovery, the trial court should have denied Crosstex's no-evidence\r\nsummary judgment.  When a party contends that it has not had adequate opportunity for\r\ndiscovery before a summary judgment hearing, it must file either an affidavit explaining the\r\nneed for further discovery or a verified motion for continuance.  <em>Tenneco Inc. v. Enter.\r\nProds. Co.</em>, 925 S.W.2d 640, 647 (Tex. 1996).  MPG did neither, and any complaint on this\r\nissue is waived.  Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1); <em>Tenneco Inc., </em>925 S.W.2d<em> </em>at 647.              </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>1. Fraud</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its suit, MPG alleged that Crosstex engaged in common law fraud.  To recover\r\nfor common law fraud, MPG must prove that: (1) Crosstex made a material representation;\r\n(2) the representation was false; (3) the representation was made with knowledge of its\r\nfalsity or made recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion;\r\n(4) Crosstex made the representation with the intention that it should be acted on by MPG;\r\n(5) MPG acted in reliance on the misrepresentation; and (6) MPG thereby suffered injury. \r\n<em>See</em> <em>Johnson  v. Brewer &amp; Pritchard, P.C.</em>, 73 S.W.3d 193, 211 n. 45 (Tex. 2002); <em>Ernst\r\n&amp; Young v. Pac. Mut. Life Ins. Co.</em>, 51 S.W.3d 573, 577 (Tex. 2001); <em>T.O. Stanley Boot</em>,\r\n847 S.W.2d at 222.  A promise of future performance constitutes an actionable\r\nmisrepresentation if the promise was made with no intention of performing at the time it\r\nwas made<em>.  See Schindler v. Austwell Farmers Coop.</em>, 841 S.W.2d 853, 854 (Tex. 1992). \r\nWhile intent is determined at the time the party makes the representation, it may also be\r\ninferred from the party's subsequent acts after the representation is made.  <em>Spoljaric v.\r\nPercival Tours, Inc.</em>, 708 S.W.2d 432, 434 (Tex. 1986).  But the mere failure to perform a\r\ncontract is not evidence of fraud.  <em>See</em> <em>Schindler</em>, 841 S.W.2d at 854. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Crosstex contended that MPG\r\nproduced no evidence for any of the requisite elements.  Specifically, Crosstex sought to\r\nshow that MPG failed to produce evidence that (1) Crosstex made a false representation\r\nknowingly, or recklessly without any knowledge of the truth; (2) MPG justifiably relied on\r\nCrosstex's representations; and (3) MPG suffered damages.  To defeat the motion, MPG\r\nwas required to produce a scintilla of probative evidence as to each element to raise a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact.  <em>See</em> <em>Ortega</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 772.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo establish the requisite elements of fraud, MPG referenced the attached affidavit\r\nof Margaret P. Graham, MPG's owner and president.  Graham stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefendants' representations concerning the location on Plaintiff's Brammer\r\nleasehold where the connection to its pipeline would be made were either false at\r\nthe time they were made, or Defendants concealed that they had no intention of\r\nestablishing a connection on this leasehold acreage.  I would not have signed [the\r\nApril 13, 2003 letter] [sic] if I had known Defendants had no intention of providing\r\na connection to their pipeline on this acreage; were going to immediately begin\r\nlooking for an off-site location for a point of connection; and were going to deny that\r\nany agreement for a connection point on the Brammer #3 lease acreage was ever\r\nreached.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A summary judgment may be based on the uncontroverted testimonial evidence of an\r\ninterested witness if the evidence is clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible and free from\r\ncontradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted.  <em>Trico\r\nTechs. Corp. v. Montiel</em>, 949 S.W.2d 308, 310 (Tex. 1997).  Affidavits must set forth facts\r\nand cannot be conclusory.  <em>Ryland Group, Inc. v. Hood</em>, 924 S.W.2d 120, 122 (Tex. 1996). \r\n\"Subjective beliefs\" are not susceptible to being readily controverted, and are, therefore,\r\nnot competent summary judgment evidence.  <em>Tex. Div.-Tranter, Inc. v. Corrozza</em>, 876\r\nS.W.2d 312, 314 (Tex. 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewing MPG's summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to MPG, we\r\nconclude that MPG failed to produce competent summary judgment evidence to raise a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding the requisite element that Crosstex made a false\r\nrepresentation knowingly, or recklessly without any knowledge of the truth.  The trial court\r\nproperly granted summary judgment on MPG's fraud claim.                        </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>2. Negligent Misrepresentation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its third cause of action, MPG alleged that Crosstex negligently misrepresented\r\ncertain information in its dealings with MPG.  To recover for negligent misrepresentation,\r\nMPG must prove that: (1) Crosstex made a representation in the course of its business,\r\nor in a transaction in which it has a pecuniary interest; (2) Crosstex supplied \"false\r\ninformation\" for the guidance of others; (3) Crosstex did not exercise reasonable care or\r\ncompetence in obtaining or communicating the information; and (4) MPG suffered\r\npecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the representation.  <em>Fed. Land Bank Ass'n v. Sloane</em>,\r\n825 S.W.2d 439, 442 (Tex. 1991).  The sort of \"false information\" contemplated in a\r\nnegligent misrepresentation case is a statement of existing fact, not a promise of future\r\nconduct.  <em>Key v. Pierce</em>, 8 S.W.3d 704, 709 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1999, pet. denied);\r\n<em>Allied Vista, Inc. v. Holt</em>, 987 S.W.2d 138, 141 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet.\r\ndenied).  Crosstex asserted in its no-evidence summary judgment motion that MPG\r\nproduced no evidence that Crosstex made a false statement, or that MPG justifiably relied\r\non any representation Crosstex made.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its response to the no-evidence summary judgment motion, MPG referenced the\r\nattached affidavit of Margaret P. Graham.  In her affidavit, Graham identifies as \"false\r\ninformation\" told by Crosstex to her that it would connect to the pipeline on her leasehold\r\nand place the sales meter at the pipeline.  MPG's response also references the deposition\r\nof Scott Brown, a Crosstex employee.  Brown states in his deposition that the April 10,\r\n2003 letter agreement contemplated the meter being placed right next to the pipeline. \r\nGraham also states in her affidavit that Crosstex's representations were \"either false at the\r\ntime they were made, or [Crosstex] concealed that they had no intention of establishing a\r\nconnection on the leasehold acreage.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDespite Graham's subjective belief that she was given false information, this type\r\nof promise of future conduct is not the type of \"false information\" contemplated by the tort\r\nof negligent misrepresentation.  <em>See Key</em>, 8 S.W.3d at 709.  Such statements are not\r\nstatements of existing fact, and are not actionable in negligent misrepresentation.  <em>Id.</em> at\r\n709.  Reviewing this evidence regarding MPG's negligent misrepresentation claim in the\r\nlight most favorable to MPG, we conclude that MPG's summary judgment evidence failed\r\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the \"false information\" element of their claim. \r\nThe trial court properly granted Crosstex's no-evidence summary judgment on this motion. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule MPG's second issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>IV.

(\"MPG\"), sued Appellees, Crosstex CCNG\r\nMarketing, Ltd., Crosstex Energy Services, L.P., and Crosstex Energy Services, G.P.,\r\nL.L.C. (collectively \"Crosstex\"), for breach of contract, fraud, and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation.  The trial court granted a combined traditional and no-evidence motion\r\nfor summary judgment in favor of Crosstex on the breach of contract claim, and a no-evidence motion for summary judgment in favor of Crosstex on fraud and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation claims.  In two issues, MPG contends the trial court erred in: (1) granting\r\nCrosstex's traditional and no-evidence motion for summary judgment on the breach of\r\ncontract claim; and (2) granting Crosstex's no-evidence summary judgment on the\r\nremaining claims.  For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCrosstex is the owner and operator of a natural gas pipeline that crosses MPG's\r\nleasehold.  MPG and Crosstex entered negotiations whereby Crosstex would buy 100%\r\nof the natural gas produced by MPG's well.  MPG and Crosstex signed a \"letter agreement\"\r\ndated March 12, 2003, stating that MPG would build a flow line from its well to Crosstex's\r\nGregory Gathering System.  MPG later decided that the flowline would be too expensive\r\nto do this.  As a result, Crosstex and MPG developed a new plan whereby the natural gas\r\nwould be delivered directly to Crosstex's newly-acquired Ingleside-to-Refugio eight-inch\r\npipeline that crossed MPG's leasehold.  MPG and Crosstex memorialized the new plan in\r\na second letter agreement, dated April 10, 2003.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe April 10, 2003 letter agreement stated that MPG would commit 100% of its\r\nnatural gas output from the well.  MPG would construct flow lines to deliver the gas from\r\nthe well to the \"agreed upon points of interconnection ('Points of Delivery') between the</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>facilities of MPG and Crosstex.\"<sup> (1)</sup>  MPG would also be financially responsible for the\r\npurchase and installation of the required fittings, valves, and measuring equipment at a\r\ncost of $12,500.   The agreement also outlined the term, price, and gas quality\r\nspecification.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter the April 10, 2003 letter agreement, MPG and Crosstex continued to negotiate\r\nthe measuring equipment's location and the flow line's specifications.  The negotiations\r\nincluded a field meeting in mid-May 2003, whereby the parties met to discuss the exact\r\nlocation of the measuring equipment.  Negotiations continued into September 2003 to\r\nidentify the measuring equipment's location.  The parties were not able to agree on a\r\nlocation.  The formal contract mentioned in the letter agreement was never signed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn April 6, 2004, approximately seven months after negotiations ceased, MPG filed\r\nsuit.  The trial court granted a hybrid traditional and no-evidence summary judgment on the\r\nbreach of contract claim, and a no-evidence summary judgment on the fraud and negligent\r\nmisrepresentation claims on June 21, 2005. <strong>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. Traditional Summary Judgment Standard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong>\t</strong>The function of a summary judgment is to eliminate patently unmeritorious claims\r\nand defenses, not to deprive litigants of the right to a jury trial.  <em>City of Houston v. Clear\r\nCreek Basin Auth.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1571353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1571353/city-of-houston-v-clear-creek-basin-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 678 n. 5 (Tex. 1979).  We review <em>de novo </em>a trial\r\ncourt's order granting a traditional motion for summary judgment.  <em>Joe v.

The traditional summary judgment\r\nmovant has the burden of showing that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and that\r\nit is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c); <em>Nixon v. Mr. Prop.\r\nMgmt. Co.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1782385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1782385/nixon-v-mr-property-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></a></span>, 548 (Tex. 1985).  As defendant, Crosstex is entitled to\r\nsummary judgment if it conclusively negated an essential element of MPG's breach of\r\ncontract cause of action.  <em>S.W. Elec. Power Co. v. Grant</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2105618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2105618/southwestern-elec-power-co-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span>, 215 (Tex. 2002). \r\nCrosstex bears the burden of proof and all doubts about the existence of a genuine issue\r\nof material fact are resolved against it.  <em>See</em> <em>Nixon</em>, 690 S.W.2d at 548-49.  All evidence\r\nand any reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to MPG.  <em>Id</em>.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. No-Evidence Summary Judgment Standard of Review</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA no-evidence motion for summary judgment is equivalent to a pretrial directed\r\nverdict, and this court applies the same legal sufficiency standard of review.  <em>Ortega v. City\r\nNat'l Bank</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2188399\"><a href=\"/opinion/2188399/ortega-v-city-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 772 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.) (op. on reh'g). \r\nIn an appeal of a no-evidence summary judgment, this Court reviews the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the nonmovant, disregarding all contrary evidence and inferences. \r\n<em>Merrill Dow Pharms., Inc. v. Harner</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1518823\"><a href=\"/opinion/1518823/merrell-dow-pharmaceuticals-inc-v-havner/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 711 (Tex. 1997).  We review a no-evidence summary judgment <em>de novo</em>.  <em>Id</em>.  If the nonmovant produces evidence that raises\r\na genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is improper.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i). \r\nAll that is required of the nonmovant is to produce a scintilla of probative evidence to raise\r\na genuine issue of material fact.  <em>Ortega</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 772.  There is less than a scintilla\r\nof evidence when the evidence is \"so weak as to do no more than create a mere surmise\r\nor suspicion\" of a fact.  <em>King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2331188\"><a href=\"/opinion/2331188/king-ranch-inc-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 751 (Tex. 2003). \r\nThere is more than a scintilla of evidence when the evidence allows reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in their conclusions.  <em>Id</em>.  The burden of producing evidence is\r\nentirely on the non-movant; the movant has no burden to attach any evidence to the\r\nmotion.  Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(i).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo-evidence points will be sustained when: (a) there is a complete absence of\r\nevidence of a vital fact; (b) the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving\r\nweight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (c) the evidence offered to prove\r\na vital fact is no more than a scintilla; or (d) the evidence conclusively establishes the\r\nopposite of a vital fact.  <em>King Ranch</em>, 118 S.W.3d at 751.  When the trial court does not\r\nspecify the basis upon which it granted summary judgment, the appellate court must affirm\r\nif any one of the movant's theories has merit.  <em>Star-Telegram, Inc. v. Doe</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></span>,\r\n473 (Tex. 1995).      <strong></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>III. DISCUSSION</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. Breach of Contract Claim</strong>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its first cause of action, MPG alleges that Crosstex breached the April 10, 2003\r\nletter agreement.  Crosstex moved for a hybrid traditional and no-evidence summary\r\njudgment against MPG's breach of contract claim on the following grounds: (1) there was\r\nno meeting of the minds as to the point of delivery (points of interconnection), an essential\r\nelement of the contract; (2) there was a lack of consideration; and (3) MPG was not injured\r\nby the alleged breach.  Crosstex's motion was not clearly segregated into traditional and\r\nno-evidence summary judgment grounds.  MPG, however, did not lodge an exception to\r\nany ambiguity in the motion.  <em>See</em> <em>McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746247\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746247/mcconnell-v-southside-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span>, 342-43 (Tex. 1993).  The trial court granted summary judgment, but did not specify\r\nwhether its grant pertained to the traditional motion, the no-evidence motion, or both.  We\r\nmust, therefore, analyze the no-evidence summary judgment first, followed by the\r\ntraditional summary judgment.  <em>See</em> <em>Ford Motor Co. v. Ridgway</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894501\"><a href=\"/opinion/894501/ford-motor-co-v-ridgway/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 600\r\n(Tex. 2004).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn general, a contract is legally binding only if its terms are sufficiently definite to\r\nenable a court to understand the parties' obligations.  <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City\r\nof Fort Worth</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376552/fort-worth-indep-school-dist-v-fort-worth/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 846 (Tex. 2000).  The Restatement asserts that contract\r\nterms are reasonably certain \"if they provide a basis for determining the existence of a\r\nbreach and for giving an appropriate remedy.\"  Restatement (Second) of Contracts ¬ß\r\n33(2) (1981).  Of the several elements required for a legally binding contract, two important\r\nelements are that the parties (1) have a meeting of the minds and (2) communicate\r\nconsent to the terms of the agreement.  <em>Smith v. Renz</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1659495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1659495/smith-v-renz/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 704 (Tex.\r\nApp.-Corpus Christi 1992, writ denied).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhether an agreement fails for indefiniteness is a question of law to be determined\r\nby the court.  <em>See T.O. Stanley Boot Co., Inc.  v. Bank of El Paso</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></span>, 221\r\n(Tex. 1992).  A binding contract may be formed if the parties agree on the material terms,\r\neven if they leave other provisions for later negotiation.  <em>Scott v. Ingle Bros. Pac., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1796198\"><a href=\"/opinion/1796198/scott-v-ingle-bros-pacific-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span>, 556 (Tex. 1972) (citing 1 Corbin on Contracts (1963) 87-91).  Where a\r\ncontract leaves essential terms open for future negotiation and adjustment, there is no\r\nbinding contract that can be enforced.  <em>See T.O. Stanley Boot</em>, 847 S.W.2d at 221;\r\n<em>Engelman Irrigation Dist. v. Shields Bros.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427916\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427916/engelman-irr-dist-v-shields-bros-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 352 (Tex. App.-Corpus Christi\r\n1997, pet. denied).  Texas courts favor validating transactions rather than voiding them,\r\nbut courts may not create a contract where none exists and they generally may not add,\r\nalter, or eliminate essential terms.  <em>Oakrock Exploration Co v. Killam</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2005734\"><a href=\"/opinion/2005734/oakrock-exploration-co-v-killam/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 690\r\n(Tex. App.-San Antonio 2002, pet. denied).  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA letter agreement may be binding even though it refers to the drafting of a future,\r\nmore formal agreement.  <em>See</em> <em>Foreca, S.A. v. GRD Dev. Co., Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1563171\"><a href=\"/opinion/1563171/foreca-sa-v-grd-development-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span>, 746\r\n(Tex. 1988).   But an agreement to make a future contract is enforceable only if it is\r\n\"specific as to all essential terms, and no terms of the proposed agreement may be left to\r\nfuture negotiations.\"  <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 846 (quoting <em>Foster v.\r\nWagner</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1514365\"><a href=\"/opinion/1514365/foster-v-wagner/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span>, 920-21 (Tex. App.-El Paso 1961, writ ref'd n.r.e.)).  It is well\r\nsettled law that an agreement that leaves material matters open for future adjustment and\r\nagreement that never occur, is not binding upon the parties and merely constitutes an\r\nagreement to agree.  <em>Id</em>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe April 10, 2003 letter agreement left the delivery point open for future\r\nnegotiation.  The letter agreement states the point of delivery to be \"at the agreed upon\r\npoints of interconnection (Points of Delivery) between the facilities of MPG and Crosstex.\" \r\nCrosstex contends in its summary judgment motion that point-of-delivery is an essential\r\nterm in a gas purchase agreement.  MPG does not dispute this point, but contends that the\r\nletter agreement sufficiently described the point of delivery.  We disagree.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t The letter agreement, by its very terms, left the point of delivery up to future\r\nnegotiation.  The letter agreement was not specific as to all essential terms because it left\r\nthe point of delivery to future negotiations.  <em>See</em> <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 22 S.W.3d\r\nat 846.  Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to MPG, we find that the April\r\n10, 2003 letter agreement was an unenforceable agreement to agree.  The trial court\r\nproperly granted no-evidence summary judgment.  Because resolution of this issue on no-evidence grounds is dispositive, we need not address the traditional summary judgment\r\ngrounds.  <em>See Ridgway</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894501\"><a href=\"/opinion/894501/ford-motor-co-v-ridgway/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> at 600; Tex. R. App. P. 47.1.  We overrule MPG's\r\nfirst issue.  <strong>B. Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation Claims</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs a preliminary matter, MPG complains on appeal that because there was not\r\nadequate time for discovery, the trial court should have denied Crosstex's no-evidence\r\nsummary judgment.  When a party contends that it has not had adequate opportunity for\r\ndiscovery before a summary judgment hearing, it must file either an affidavit explaining the\r\nneed for further discovery or a verified motion for continuance.  <em>Tenneco Inc. v.

Fraud</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its suit, MPG alleged that Crosstex engaged in common law fraud.  To recover\r\nfor common law fraud, MPG must prove that: (1) Crosstex made a material representation;\r\n(2) the representation was false; (3) the representation was made with knowledge of its\r\nfalsity or made recklessly without any knowledge of the truth and as a positive assertion;\r\n(4) Crosstex made the representation with the intention that it should be acted on by MPG;\r\n(5) MPG acted in reliance on the misrepresentation; and (6) MPG thereby suffered injury. \r\n<em>See</em> <em>Johnson  v. Brewer &amp; Pritchard, P.C.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2105795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2105795/johnson-v-brewer-pritchard-pc/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span>, 211 n. 45 (Tex. 2002); <em>Ernst\r\n&amp; Young v.

Stanley Boot</em>,\r\n847 S.W.2d at 222.  A promise of future performance constitutes an actionable\r\nmisrepresentation if the promise was made with no intention of performing at the time it\r\nwas made<em>.  See Schindler v. Austwell Farmers Coop.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2447500\"><a href=\"/opinion/2447500/schindler-v-austwell-farmers-co-op/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></a></span>, 854 (Tex. 1992). \r\nWhile intent is determined at the time the party makes the representation, it may also be\r\ninferred from the party's subsequent acts after the representation is made.  <em>Spoljaric v.\r\nPercival Tours, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1793550\"><a href=\"/opinion/1793550/spoljaric-v-percival-tours-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 434 (Tex. 1986).  But the mere failure to perform a\r\ncontract is not evidence of fraud.  <em>See</em> <em>Schindler</em>, 841 S.W.2d at 854. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its no-evidence motion for summary judgment, Crosstex contended that MPG\r\nproduced no evidence for any of the requisite elements.  Specifically, Crosstex sought to\r\nshow that MPG failed to produce evidence that (1) Crosstex made a false representation\r\nknowingly, or recklessly without any knowledge of the truth; (2) MPG justifiably relied on\r\nCrosstex's representations; and (3) MPG suffered damages.  To defeat the motion, MPG\r\nwas required to produce a scintilla of probative evidence as to each element to raise a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact.  <em>See</em> <em>Ortega</em>, 97 S.W.3d at 772.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo establish the requisite elements of fraud, MPG referenced the attached affidavit\r\nof Margaret P. Graham, MPG's owner and president.  Graham stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDefendants' representations concerning the location on Plaintiff's Brammer\r\nleasehold where the connection to its pipeline would be made were either false at\r\nthe time they were made, or Defendants concealed that they had no intention of\r\nestablishing a connection on this leasehold acreage.  I would not have signed [the\r\nApril 13, 2003 letter] [sic] if I had known Defendants had no intention of providing\r\na connection to their pipeline on this acreage; were going to immediately begin\r\nlooking for an off-site location for a point of connection; and were going to deny that\r\nany agreement for a connection point on the Brammer #3 lease acreage was ever\r\nreached.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>A summary judgment may be based on the uncontroverted testimonial evidence of an\r\ninterested witness if the evidence is clear, positive, direct, otherwise credible and free from\r\ncontradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted.  <em>Trico\r\nTechs. Corp. v. Montiel</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2419420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2419420/trico-technologies-corp-v-montiel/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 310 (Tex. 1997).  Affidavits must set forth facts\r\nand cannot be conclusory.  <em>Ryland Group, Inc. v.

Div.-Tranter, Inc. v. Corrozza</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2455741\"><a href=\"/opinion/2455741/texas-division-tranter-inc-v-carrozza/\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 314 (Tex. 1994).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewing MPG's summary judgment evidence in the light most favorable to MPG, we\r\nconclude that MPG failed to produce competent summary judgment evidence to raise a\r\ngenuine issue of material fact regarding the requisite element that Crosstex made a false\r\nrepresentation knowingly, or recklessly without any knowledge of the truth.  The trial court\r\nproperly granted summary judgment on MPG's fraud claim.                        </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>2. Negligent Misrepresentation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its third cause of action, MPG alleged that Crosstex negligently misrepresented\r\ncertain information in its dealings with MPG.  To recover for negligent misrepresentation,\r\nMPG must prove that: (1) Crosstex made a representation in the course of its business,\r\nor in a transaction in which it has a pecuniary interest; (2) Crosstex supplied \"false\r\ninformation\" for the guidance of others; (3) Crosstex did not exercise reasonable care or\r\ncompetence in obtaining or communicating the information; and (4) MPG suffered\r\npecuniary loss by justifiably relying on the representation.  <em>Fed. Land Bank Ass'n v. Sloane</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></span>, 442 (Tex. 1991).  The sort of \"false information\" contemplated in a\r\nnegligent misrepresentation case is a statement of existing fact, not a promise of future\r\nconduct.  <em>Key v. Pierce</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1859525\"><a href=\"/opinion/1859525/key-v-pierce/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span>, 709 (Tex. App.-Fort Worth 1999, pet. denied);\r\n<em>Allied Vista, Inc. v. Holt</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533237\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533237/allied-vista-inc-v-holt/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span>, 141 (Tex. App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, pet.\r\ndenied).  Crosstex asserted in its no-evidence summary judgment motion that MPG\r\nproduced no evidence that Crosstex made a false statement, or that MPG justifiably relied\r\non any representation Crosstex made.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn its response to the no-evidence summary judgment motion, MPG referenced the\r\nattached affidavit of Margaret P. Graham.  In her affidavit, Graham identifies as \"false\r\ninformation\" told by Crosstex to her that it would connect to the pipeline on her leasehold\r\nand place the sales meter at the pipeline.  MPG's response also references the deposition\r\nof Scott Brown, a Crosstex employee.  Brown states in his deposition that the April 10,\r\n2003 letter agreement contemplated the meter being placed right next to the pipeline. \r\nGraham also states in her affidavit that Crosstex's representations were \"either false at the\r\ntime they were made, or [Crosstex] concealed that they had no intention of establishing a\r\nconnection on the leasehold acreage.\"  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDespite Graham's subjective belief that she was given false information, this type\r\nof promise of future conduct is not the type of \"false information\" contemplated by the tort\r\nof negligent misrepresentation.  <em>See Key</em>, 8 S.W.3d at 709.  Such statements are not\r\nstatements of existing fact, and are not actionable in negligent misrepresentation.  <em>Id.</em> at\r\n709.  Reviewing this evidence regarding MPG's negligent misrepresentation claim in the\r\nlight most favorable to MPG, we conclude that MPG's summary judgment evidence failed\r\nto raise a genuine issue of material fact as to the \"false information\" element of their claim. \r\nThe trial court properly granted Crosstex's no-evidence summary judgment on this motion. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe overrule MPG's second issue.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>IV.

Crosstex alleges that the interconnection point is a material\r\nor essential element of the agreement, and the interconnection point was left up to future negotiation. \r\nAccording to Crosstex, there was, therefore, no \"meeting of the minds,\" and thus no contract.   </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
