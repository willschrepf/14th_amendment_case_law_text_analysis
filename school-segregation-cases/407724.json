Peñagarícano-Brown, Assistant Solicitor General,\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Salvador J. Antonetti-Stutts,\nSolicitor General, Mariana D. Negrón-Vargas, Deputy Solicitor\nGeneral, and Maite D. Oronoz-Rodríguez, Deputy Solicitor General,\nwere on brief, for cross-appellee Sila María Calderón.\n\n\n\n                         March 13, 2007\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. The main issue in this case is\n\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\n\naward attorneys' fees.   See 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) (\"[T]he court, in\n\nits discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the\n\nUnited States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\n\n. . . .\" (emphasis added)).      After careful consideration, we\n\ndetermine that the district court did not abuse its discretion, and\n\nwe affirm the denial of attorneys' fees to both parties.\n\n                            Background\n\n          On November 2, 2004, a general election was held in\n\nPuerto Rico, pitting Pedro J. Rosselló-González and Luis Fortuño,\n\ncandidates on the New Progressive Party ticket for Governor and\n\nResident Commissioner, against Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá and Roberto\n\nPrats-Palerm, candidates on the Popular Democratic Party ticket.1\n\nAfter the balloting was conducted, a series of disputes arose\n\nbetween the parties as to the procedures for issuing and counting\n\nabsentee ballots, whether a general recount should be conducted,\n\nand whether certain ballots known as \"three-mark split\" ballots\n\nshould be counted. A more detailed description of these claims may\n\nbe found in our first opinion in this case, Rosselló-González v.\n\nCalderón-Serra, 398 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Rubén Berríos-Martínez and Edwin Irizarry-Mora were also\ncandidates for Governor and Resident Commissioner under the Puerto\nRico Independence Party ticket.\n\n                                -3-\n\f           On    November   10,     Rosselló-González       and    others       (the\n\n\"Plaintiffs\")2    filed     suit    against    then-Governor        Sila        María\n\nCalderón-Serra,      Acevedo-Vilá,     and    others   (the       \"Defendants\")3\n\nalleging constitutional violations arising out of the conduct of\n\nthe election. Specifically, Plaintiffs asked for a preliminary and\n\npermanent injunction ordering Defendants (1) to perform a full\n\nrecount of all of the votes cast in the general election, (2) to\n\nensure that all persons who had requested absentee ballots had\n\nreceived them, and to count all absentee ballots received within\n\nthirty days of the injunction, (3) to set a uniform standard for\n\ntreatment of split ballots, and (4) to refrain from spending any\n\nmoney on the transition before the recount was completed.                         On\n\nNovember 23, the district court ordered that all of the ballots be\n\nrecounted and that the disputed \"three-mark split\" ballots be\n\nsegregated and not adjudicated.\n\n           Defendants     brought     an    interlocutory     appeal       of    the\n\ndistrict   court's    recount      order.     We   issued    our    opinion        on\n\nDecember 15, 2004.4       Id.   We ruled that \"the Rosselló complaint\n\n\n2\n   The Plaintiffs also include Fortuño, as well as voters who cast\nregular ballots in the election and voters who cast absentee\nballots.\n3\n  The Defendants also include the Puerto Rico Electoral Commission\n(the \"CEC\"), Aurelio Gracia-Morales (president of the CEC), Gerardo\nA. Cruz, Thomas Rivera-Schatz, Juan Dalmau-Ramírez (members of the\nCEC), and the Incoming Government Transition Committee (a\ngovernment entity).\n4\n    The opinion was corrected on January 28, 2005.\n\n                                      -4-\n\falleges the violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right, and\n\nthus, presents a colorable claim under § 1983 for subject-matter\n\njurisdiction purposes.\"         Id. at 15.     Nevertheless, we held that\n\nPlaintiffs'     case     \"presents     even    less    cause     for   federal\n\nintervention\"     than    in   prior   cases   where    we     abstained   from\n\nintervening.    Id. at 18.      Accordingly, we vacated the preliminary\n\ninjunction and ordered the district court to dismiss with prejudice\n\nall of Plaintiffs' claims \"relating to the adjudication of the\n\nthree-mark ballots, and all claims relating to the simultaneous\n\ngeneral canvass/recount issue.\"          Id.    We also dismissed without\n\nprejudice the claims relating to the absentee ballots and Puerto\n\nRico Law 197.    Id.\n\n          Both parties moved for attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1988, and Defendants requested attorneys' fees as a sanction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1927.        The district court referred the matter to\n\na magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation denying\n\nPlaintiffs' fees and granting Defendants' fees.              Plaintiffs filed\n\nan objection to the adoption of the magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation.        The district court agreed with the magistrate\n\njudge that Plaintiffs were not prevailing parties and thus were not\n\nentitled to legal fees. However, the district court found that the\n\nabsentee ballot claim presented an \"enfranchisement claim\" that\n\nmight be recognized as justiciable under Partido Nuevo Progresista\n\nv. Barreto Pérez, 639 F.2d 825 (1st Cir. 1980), and that Plaintiffs\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\freceived substantial relief on this claim, albeit not backed by\n\njudicial imprimatur.      Furthermore, the district court found that\n\nPlaintiffs had a colorable claim under Puerto Rico law to a\n\nsimultaneous recount and canvass, and that such a claim could have\n\nbeen brought under the supplemental jurisdiction of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1367.    Additionally, the district court noted that a claim that\n\nthe split ballots were adjudicated inconsistently (as Plaintiffs\n\nhad initially alleged) might have been a valid claim under Bush v.\n\nGore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000), but that after the litigation commenced,\n\nit appeared that the ballots would be adjudicated consistently.\n\nAccordingly, the district court found that Plaintiffs had stated\n\ncolorable, non-frivolous claims, and as such, Defendants were not\n\nentitled to attorneys' fees.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n            We review an award of attorneys' fees for \"manifest abuse\n\nof discretion, and 'a reviewing court customarily defers to the\n\ntrial   judge,   whose   intimate   knowledge   of   the   nuances   of   the\n\nunderlying case uniquely positions him to construct a condign\n\naward.'\"    Díaz-Rivera v. Rivera-Rodríguez, 377 F.3d 119, 124 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (quoting Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247\n\nF.3d 288, 292 (1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n            We begin by addressing Plaintiffs' request for attorneys'\n\nfees.     Section 1988 states that a plaintiffs may be entitled to\n\nattorneys' fees in the discretion of the district court only if he\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\for she is a \"prevailing party.\"        42 U.S.C. § 1988(b).      A party is\n\na prevailing party \"when actual relief on the merits of his claim\n\nmaterially alters the legal relationship between the parties by\n\nmodifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits\n\nthe plaintiff.\"     Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 293.\n\nFurthermore, the change in legal relationship must be brought about\n\nby \"judicial imprimatur.\" Buckhannon Board & Care Home, Inc. v. W.\n\nVa. Dep't of Health & Human Res., 532 U.S. 598, 605 (2001).              The\n\ndistrict court found that Plaintiffs were not prevailing parties\n\nbecause they did not receive any final relief backed by judicial\n\nimprimatur.\n\n           Plaintiffs claim that they received some actual relief on\n\ntheir claims when the district judge issued orders asserting\n\njurisdiction over the absentee ballots and directing Defendants to\n\nperform a recount by counting all ballots but segregating and not\n\nadjudicating the disputed three-mark split ballots.           However, we\n\nlater reversed the judgment of the district court and dismissed all\n\nof Plaintiffs' claims.         Rosselló-González, 398 F.3d at 18 (\"We\n\nVACATE   the   issuance   of    the   preliminary   injunction    with   the\n\ndirection that the District Court dismiss with prejudice all claims\n\nin the Rosselló complaint relating to the adjudication of the\n\nthree-mark ballots, and all claims relating to the simultaneous\n\ngeneral canvass/recount issue. The District Court is also directed\n\nto dismiss without prejudice the claims relating to the absentee\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fballots, and any alleged violations of Puerto Rico Law 197.\").              It\n\nis clear that where an appellate court has reversed a district\n\ncourt's rulings in favor of plaintiffs and has dismissed their\n\ncase, such plaintiffs cannot be \"prevailing part[ies]\" because any\n\nrelief they obtained lacks judicial imprimatur.            See, e.g., Altman\n\nv. Bedford Central Sch. Dist., 245 F.3d 49, 81-82 (2d Cir. 2001)\n\n(\"[G]iven our reversal of the district court's rulings in favor of\n\nplaintiffs on their First Amendment claims, the district court's\n\naward of attorneys' fees to them as 'prevailing parties' must also\n\nbe reversed.\" (citation omitted)); Pottgen v. Mo. State High Sch.\n\nActivities   Assoc.,   103   F.3d   720,   723-24   (8th    Cir.   1997)   (\"A\n\nplaintiff cannot qualify as a prevailing party if the only basis\n\nfor his claim of success on the merits is a judgment that has been\n\nreversed on appeal.\"). Although Plaintiffs initially received some\n\ninjunctive relief from the district court, our later vacation of\n\nthat injunction and dismissal of all claims precludes Plaintiffs\n\nfrom now claiming to be \"prevailing parties\" for the purposes of 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988(b). Although Plaintiffs argue that they nevertheless\n\nobtained relief when Defendants changed their position on the\n\nabsentee ballot and recount issues, those positions were not the\n\nresult of judicial imprimatur.        As such, the district court was\n\ncorrect to deny attorneys' fees to Plaintiffs.\n\n          We now come to Defendants' request for attorneys' fees.\n\nPrevailing defendants in an action brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fmay be granted attorneys' fees only \"upon a finding that the\n\nplaintiff's   action     was    frivolous,   unreasonable,     or   without\n\nfoundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith.\"\n\nChristiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412, 421 (1978); see\n\nalso Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5, 14-16 (1980) (applying the\n\nChristiansburg Garment Co. standard to a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 case).\n\n\"In determining whether this standard has been met, the court must\n\nassess the claim at the time the complaint was filed, and must\n\navoid the post-hoc reasoning that, because the plaintiff did not\n\nultimately    prevail,    the    claim    must   have   been    frivolous,\n\nunreasonable or without foundation.\"          Tang v. Dep't of Elderly\n\nAffairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir. 1998).         Even if the Plaintiffs'\n\naction was frivolous, it is within the discretion of the district\n\ncourt to deny fees.    Id. at 15 (\"[T]he district court still retains\n\ndiscretion to deny or reduce fee requests after considering all the\n\nnuances of a particular case.\").          The district court found that\n\nPlaintiffs' action was not frivolous, and thus exercised its broad\n\ndiscretion to not award attorneys' fees.\n\n          We have often said that a district court is best placed\n\nto evaluate attorneys' fees requests; the district judge who\n\npresided over the case has \"intimate knowledge of the nuances of\n\nthe underlying case\" which \"uniquely positions him\" to determine\n\nwhether a prevailing defendant is entitled to a fee award.             Gay\n\nOfficers Action League, 247 F.3d at 292.           We may overturn the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdenial of attorneys' fees to defendants only if \"it clearly appears\n\nthat the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight,\n\nrelied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors\n\n(and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing\n\nthem.\"   Id. at 292-93.\n\n           Here, the district court properly reviewed all of the\n\nfactors in this case.     It evaluated the state of the Supreme Court\n\nand First Circuit precedent at the time that Plaintiffs filed their\n\ncomplaint, looked to the nature and quality of allegations in their\n\ncomplaint, and appraised the quantum of evidence they submitted.\n\nDefendants can point to no additional factor that the district\n\ncourt should have considered.        Furthermore, Defendants do not\n\nidentify any factor that was improperly considered. Defendants do,\n\nhowever, contend that existing precedent at the time Plaintiffs'\n\ncase was filed did in fact preclude or limit the potential for\n\nsuccess on a number of their claims, and that this was an \"improper\n\nweighing\" of the factors.\n\n           Even if Defendants can show that some of Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims could be construed as unmeritorious, this does not show that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in finding that the\n\ncomplaint as a whole was not frivolous, and that in any event,\n\nattorneys' fees were not warranted in this case.      To reverse for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion, Defendants must show something other\n\nthan disagreement with the ultimate conclusion of the district\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcourt.    See Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F.3d\n\n220, 227 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"If writing on a pristine page, we might\n\nhave weighed the mix of factors differently -- but that is beside\n\nthe point.    Absent a mistake of law or a clear error in judgment --\n\nneither of which is evident here -- we must defer to the trial\n\ncourt's first-hand knowledge and to its battlefield determination\n\nthat the specific facts of this case do not warrant a fee award.\").\n\nAccordingly, we can discern no abuse of discretion committed by the\n\ndistrict     court    in     denying    attorneys'     fees     under   §    1988    to\n\nDefendants.\n\n             Finally, defendants suggest that they are also entitled\n\nto attorneys' fees under 28 U.S.C. § 1927.                    A district court is\n\npermitted     to     award     fees    when     an   attorney    \"multiplies        the\n\nproceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\"                      28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1927.      As with a petition for fees under § 1988, \"we accord\n\nextraordinary deference to a district court's decision to deny\n\nsanctions.\"          McLane,    Graf,    Raulerson      &   Middleton,       P.A.    v.\n\nRechberger, 280 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted).                 As such, we review the district\n\ncourt's decision to deny attorneys fees under § 1927 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n             The district court correctly identified the proper legal\n\nstandard to be applied in this case: § 1927 sanctions may be\n\nawarded when \"an attorney's conduct in multiplying proceedings is\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\funreasonable and harassing or annoying.\"      Cruz v. Savage, 896 F.2d\n\n626, 632 (1st Cir. 1990).      Thus, a party may be penalized under\n\n§ 1927 only when it displays a \"serious and studied disregard for\n\nthe orderly process of justice.\"        United States v. Nesglo, Inc.,\n\n744 F.2d 887, 891 (1st Cir. 1984) (quoting Kiefel v. Las Vegas\n\nHacienda, Inc., 404 F.2d 1163 (7th Cir. 1968)).\n\n          The district court did not explicitly state why it was\n\ndenying attorneys' fees under § 1927.         However, \"while we have\n\nencouraged district courts to give reasons for denying sanctions,\n\nwe have not required them to do so\" if the reasons for denying\n\nsanctions are apparent from the record.      McLane, Graf, Raulerson &\n\nMiddleton, 280 F.3d at 45.     Here, the record supports an implicit\n\nfinding   that    Plaintiffs   did   not   vexatiously   multiply   the\n\nproceedings.     Plaintiffs filed a complaint and later amended it.\n\nPlaintiffs and Defendants proceeded to argue vigorously for and\n\nagainst the relief sought. There is no allegation, for example, of\n\nduplicative motions being filed or repeated refusals to comply with\n\ncourt orders.    To the contrary, most of Defendants' arguments for\n\nsanctions under § 1927 are based on the alleged frivolity of\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint, arguments which go mainly to Defendants'\n\nrequest for attorneys' fees under § 1988, not under § 1927.\n\nAccordingly, we do not find that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying Defendants' request for § 1927 sanctions\n\nagainst Plaintiffs and/or their attorneys.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f                            Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.   All parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

The main issue in this case is\n\nwhether the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\n\naward attorneys' fees.   See 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b) (\"[T]he court, in\n\nits discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the\n\nUnited States, a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\n\n. . . .\" (emphasis added)).      After careful consideration, we\n\ndetermine that the district court did not abuse its discretion, and\n\nwe affirm the denial of attorneys' fees to both parties.\n\n                            Background\n\n          On November 2, 2004, a general election was held in\n\nPuerto Rico, pitting Pedro J. Rosselló-González and Luis Fortuño,\n\ncandidates on the New Progressive Party ticket for Governor and\n\nResident Commissioner, against Aníbal Acevedo-Vilá and Roberto\n\nPrats-Palerm, candidates on the Popular Democratic Party ticket.1\n\nAfter the balloting was conducted, a series of disputes arose\n\nbetween the parties as to the procedures for issuing and counting\n\nabsentee ballots, whether a general recount should be conducted,\n\nand whether certain ballots known as \"three-mark split\" ballots\n\nshould be counted. A more detailed description of these claims may\n\nbe found in our first opinion in this case, Rosselló-González v.\n\nCalderón-Serra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n1\n    Rubén Berríos-Martínez and Edwin Irizarry-Mora were also\ncandidates for Governor and Resident Commissioner under the Puerto\nRico Independence Party ticket.\n\n                                -3-\n\f           On    November   10,     Rosselló-González       and    others       (the\n\n\"Plaintiffs\")2    filed     suit    against    then-Governor        Sila        María\n\nCalderón-Serra,      Acevedo-Vilá,     and    others   (the       \"Defendants\")3\n\nalleging constitutional violations arising out of the conduct of\n\nthe election. Specifically, Plaintiffs asked for a preliminary and\n\npermanent injunction ordering Defendants (1) to perform a full\n\nrecount of all of the votes cast in the general election, (2) to\n\nensure that all persons who had requested absentee ballots had\n\nreceived them, and to count all absentee ballots received within\n\nthirty days of the injunction, (3) to set a uniform standard for\n\ntreatment of split ballots, and (4) to refrain from spending any\n\nmoney on the transition before the recount was completed.                         On\n\nNovember 23, the district court ordered that all of the ballots be\n\nrecounted and that the disputed \"three-mark split\" ballots be\n\nsegregated and not adjudicated.\n\n           Defendants     brought     an    interlocutory     appeal       of    the\n\ndistrict   court's    recount      order.     We   issued    our    opinion        on\n\nDecember 15, 2004.4       Id.   We ruled that \"the Rosselló complaint\n\n\n2\n   The Plaintiffs also include Fortuño, as well as voters who cast\nregular ballots in the election and voters who cast absentee\nballots.\n3\n  The Defendants also include the Puerto Rico Electoral Commission\n(the \"CEC\"), Aurelio Gracia-Morales (president of the CEC), Gerardo\nA.

Nevertheless, we held that\n\nPlaintiffs'     case     \"presents     even    less    cause     for   federal\n\nintervention\"     than    in   prior   cases   where    we     abstained   from\n\nintervening.    Id. at 18.      Accordingly, we vacated the preliminary\n\ninjunction and ordered the district court to dismiss with prejudice\n\nall of Plaintiffs' claims \"relating to the adjudication of the\n\nthree-mark ballots, and all claims relating to the simultaneous\n\ngeneral canvass/recount issue.\"          Id.    We also dismissed without\n\nprejudice the claims relating to the absentee ballots and Puerto\n\nRico Law 197.    Id.\n\n          Both parties moved for attorneys' fees under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1988, and Defendants requested attorneys' fees as a sanction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1927.        The district court referred the matter to\n\na magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation denying\n\nPlaintiffs' fees and granting Defendants' fees.              Plaintiffs filed\n\nan objection to the adoption of the magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation.        The district court agreed with the magistrate\n\njudge that Plaintiffs were not prevailing parties and thus were not\n\nentitled to legal fees.

Furthermore, the district court found that\n\nPlaintiffs had a colorable claim under Puerto Rico law to a\n\nsimultaneous recount and canvass, and that such a claim could have\n\nbeen brought under the supplemental jurisdiction of 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1367.    Additionally, the district court noted that a claim that\n\nthe split ballots were adjudicated inconsistently (as Plaintiffs\n\nhad initially alleged) might have been a valid claim under Bush v.\n\nGore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), but that after the litigation commenced,\n\nit appeared that the ballots would be adjudicated consistently.\n\nAccordingly, the district court found that Plaintiffs had stated\n\ncolorable, non-frivolous claims, and as such, Defendants were not\n\nentitled to attorneys' fees.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n            We review an award of attorneys' fees for \"manifest abuse\n\nof discretion, and 'a reviewing court customarily defers to the\n\ntrial   judge,   whose   intimate   knowledge   of   the   nuances   of   the\n\nunderlying case uniquely positions him to construct a condign\n\naward.'\"    Díaz-Rivera v.

Although Plaintiffs argue that they nevertheless\n\nobtained relief when Defendants changed their position on the\n\nabsentee ballot and recount issues, those positions were not the\n\nresult of judicial imprimatur.

Even if the Plaintiffs'\n\naction was frivolous, it is within the discretion of the district\n\ncourt to deny fees.    Id. at 15 (\"[T]he district court still retains\n\ndiscretion to deny or reduce fee requests after considering all the\n\nnuances of a particular case.\").          The district court found that\n\nPlaintiffs' action was not frivolous, and thus exercised its broad\n\ndiscretion to not award attorneys' fees.\n\n          We have often said that a district court is best placed\n\nto evaluate attorneys' fees requests; the district judge who\n\npresided over the case has \"intimate knowledge of the nuances of\n\nthe underlying case\" which \"uniquely positions him\" to determine\n\nwhether a prevailing defendant is entitled to a fee award.             Gay\n\nOfficers Action League, 247 F.3d at 292.           We may overturn the\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdenial of attorneys' fees to defendants only if \"it clearly appears\n\nthat the trial court ignored a factor deserving significant weight,\n\nrelied upon an improper factor, or evaluated all the proper factors\n\n(and no improper ones), but made a serious mistake in weighing\n\nthem.\"   Id. at 292-93.\n\n           Here, the district court properly reviewed all of the\n\nfactors in this case.     It evaluated the state of the Supreme Court\n\nand First Circuit precedent at the time that Plaintiffs filed their\n\ncomplaint, looked to the nature and quality of allegations in their\n\ncomplaint, and appraised the quantum of evidence they submitted.\n\nDefendants can point to no additional factor that the district\n\ncourt should have considered.        Furthermore, Defendants do not\n\nidentify any factor that was improperly considered. Defendants do,\n\nhowever, contend that existing precedent at the time Plaintiffs'\n\ncase was filed did in fact preclude or limit the potential for\n\nsuccess on a number of their claims, and that this was an \"improper\n\nweighing\" of the factors.\n\n           Even if Defendants can show that some of Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims could be construed as unmeritorious, this does not show that\n\nthe district court abused its discretion in finding that the\n\ncomplaint as a whole was not frivolous, and that in any event,\n\nattorneys' fees were not warranted in this case.      To reverse for\n\nmanifest abuse of discretion, Defendants must show something other\n\nthan disagreement with the ultimate conclusion of the district\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fcourt.

To the contrary, most of Defendants' arguments for\n\nsanctions under § 1927 are based on the alleged frivolity of\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint, arguments which go mainly to Defendants'\n\nrequest for attorneys' fees under § 1988, not under § 1927.\n\nAccordingly, we do not find that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying Defendants' request for § 1927 sanctions\n\nagainst Plaintiffs and/or their attorneys.\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f                            Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.   All parties shall bear their own costs.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f</pre>",
