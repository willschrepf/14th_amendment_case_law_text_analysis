Co., <cross_reference>213 Ala. 92</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104 So. 258</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The questions presented arose in the attempt of the city of Birmingham to eliminate grade crossings used by companies operating railroads in a city of more than 35,000 population; and a further question is presented as to the nature and extent of the appeal provided to any court having chancery jurisdiction. Code 1923, &#167;&#167; 2070-2075. The nature and extent of such trials in equity were touched upon on former appeal as follows:</p>\n<p>\"It was intended the proceeding should bear some analogy to appeals. Among the common incidents of appeals are these: A fixed right to thus test the legality of the matter assailed; the right, upon execution of a proper bond, to supersede or suspend the execution of the order or decree pending the appeal; and the right, upon a hearing, to vacate or restrain the execution of the order, if found invalid. These are the incidents we think the Legislature had in mind in styling the proceeding to test the validity of a legislative ordinance as 'an appeal.' It provides a cumulative remedy as of right and not of discretion. * * * We have outlined the procedure to perfect the appeal and the order made thereon in the case at bar as an approved precedent in such cases. In the further progress of the cause the petition is to be treated as in lieu of a bill of injunction, subject to the same rules as to amendment, demurrer, and answer.\" <cross_reference>213 Ala. 92</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>94</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104 So. 258</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>260</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>There may be analogy in the construction given other statutes providing for appeals to a court of equity. Alabama Public Service Commission v. Mobile Gas Co., <cross_reference>213 Ala. 50</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104 So. 538</cross_reference>, 41 A.L.R. 872.</p>\n<p>After the former decision, the pending case in the circuit court in equity proceeded to a decree overruling grounds of demurrer of the city to the bill filed by the railroad company against that municipality, contesting the validity of the ordinances seeking to require the Louisville  Nashville Company and the Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company at their expense to eliminate grade crossings at the several streets in said city in the manner specifically indicated &#8212; by building trestles, bridges, etc., over the street. The tracks of the Louisville  Nashville Company are averred to cross at grade the several public streets in the city of Birmingham; the way of the railroad company long preceding the growth of the city and its present congested traffic.</p>\n<p>The demurrer of respondent was directed to the bill as a whole, and grounds thereof limited or directed to certain specified aspects of the bill. The decree overruled the demurrer to the bill as a whole, and sustained certain specific grounds of demurrer, and overruled others. The effect of such a decree on demurrer was discussed in Pollak v. Stout's Mountain Co., <cross_reference>184 Ala. 331</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>63 So. 531</cross_reference>; s. c., <cross_reference>201 Ala. 700</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>78 So. 990</cross_reference>.

The complainant may thereupon so amend the part stricken as to give the bill equity in that regard, or he may by express amendment, eliminate the portion stricken by demurrer, or, if the bill still contains equity, may proceed thereon without amendment as if the defective feature had been stricken on motion.\"</p>\n<p>It is elementary that, when an attack is made upon an ordinance on the ground that it is unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive, the burden is upon the pleader or attacking party.

In order to justify the court in annulling an ordinance or by-law on the ground that it is unreasonable it must be 'demonstrably shown' that it is unreasonable; 'equipoise of opinion' on the matter will not warrant the setting aside of the ordinance of by-law on the ground of unreasonableness.

The extent of the police power conferred by the charter of cities (article 27, Code 1923, &#167;&#167; 2070-2075; City of Birmingham v. L.  N. Co., <cross_reference>213 Ala. 92</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>104 So. 258</cross_reference>) has been adverted to by this court and the Supreme Court of the United States (N. P. Ry. Co. v. State of Minnesota, <cross_reference>208 U.S. 583</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>28 S.Ct. 341</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>52 L.Ed. 630</cross_reference>; Chicago, M.  St. P. R. R. Co. v.

Minneapolis v. St. Paul, M. \nM. R. Co., <cross_reference>98 Minn. 380</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>108 N.W. 261</cross_reference>, 28 L.R.A. (N.S.) 298, 120 Am. St. Rep. 581, was quoted with approval by the justice in that case (Chicago, etc., Co. v. City of Minneapolis, supra), saying:</p>\n<p>\" 'A railroad company receives its charter and franchise subject to the implied right of the state to establish and open such streets and highways over and across its right of way as public convenience and necessity may from time to time require. That right on the part of the state attaches by implication of law to the franchise of the railroad company, and imposes upon it an obligation to construct and maintain at its own expense suitable crossings at new streets and highways to the same extent as required by the rules of the common law at streets and highways in existence when the railroad was constructed.' In that case, it appeared that long after the construction of the railroad, the city of Minneapolis had laid out a street across the railroad right of way, building at its own cost a bridge over the railroad tracks. After the bridge had been maintained for several years by the city it was destroyed by fire, and the city then demanded that the railroad company should build a new one. This demand the state court sustained; and, mandamus having thereupon been awarded (<cross_reference>101 Minn. 545</cross_reference>\n[112 N.W. 1142]), the case was brought to this court, one of the grounds being that the action of the state deprived the company of its property without due process of law. The judgment was affirmed (St. Paul, M.  M. R. Co. v. Minnesota, <cross_reference>214 U.S. 497</cross_reference>\n[<cross_reference>53 L.Ed. 1060</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>29 S.Ct. 698</cross_reference>]), this conclusion being reached upon the authority of Northern P. R. Co. v. Duluth,<cross_reference>208 U.S. 583</cross_reference> [<cross_reference>28 S.Ct. 341</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>52 L.Ed. 630</cross_reference>].\"</p>\n<p>The case of C., I.  W. R. Co. v. Connersville, <cross_reference>218 U.S. 336</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>31 S.Ct. 93</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>54 L.Ed. 1060</cross_reference>, 20 Ann. Cas. 1206, was likewise referred to as being a case where the city was extended and intersecting streets laid out along an existing railway; and it was held that there was no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment in refusing to allow the company to be reimbursed for the expense for the new and required improvement; and the rights in the premises were said to be \"concluded by former decisions\" of the Supreme Court of the United States. The subject is concluded by Mr. Justice Hughes as follows:</p>\n<p>\"* * * It necessarily follows that, if the city of Minneapolis had opened a public road through the embankment of the plaintiff in error, the latter would have had no ground to complain that its constitutional rights had been violated because it was compelled to bridge the gap at its own cost. No different rule could be applied because the highway was laid out in order to increase the advantages of a public park. In this aspect, it would be equally a crossing devoted to the public use (Shoemaker v. United States, <cross_reference>147 U.S. 282</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>297</cross_reference>\n[<cross_reference>13 S.Ct. 361</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>37 L.Ed. 170</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>184</cross_reference>]); and we see no basis for a distinction in principle in the case of an intersecting public road opened under competent authority because such a highway might lead to public recreation grounds instead of to places of business, or might connect lakes instead of avenues.\" Chicago, M.  St. P. R. Co. v. City of Minneapolis, <cross_reference>232 U.S. 430</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>441</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>34 S.Ct. 400</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>402</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>58 L.Ed. 671</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>675</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The action of a municipality in deciding the necessity for and ordering that specified grade crossings be eliminated by the reasonable means duly indicated by ordinance under authority of statute is the province and policy of its duly constituted legislative body, and the courts have no voice in the determination of that necessity. That is, the question of the wisdom and public necessity for the same is, under sections 2070, 2072, Code of 1923, for the decision of the legislative body of the city of Birmingham in the exercise of the prerogative of the sovereign and police power.

St. Rep. 44) where the observation is made that an ordinance imposing a license tax and to regulate hacks, etc., was in nature and essence a police regulation, and that its \"policy or reasonableness\" could not be inquired into. Mr. Chief Justice Brickell there said, of the exercise of such power:</p>\n<p>\"The power may be, and is often delegated to municipal corporations, to be exercised for the promotion of the public convenience. When the power has been delegated in terms of the character employed in the amended charter, the validity of ordinances, prescribing the times, places and manner in which the employment is to be pursued, has been uniformly sustained.

Jones, <cross_reference>118 Ind. 41</cross_reference> [20 N.E. 644]; s. c., 10 Am. St. Rep. 100. Such ordinances are in their nature and essence police laws or regulations, and when adopted in the exercise of an express legislative grant of power, there can be no inquiry into or discussion of their policy or reasonableness. 'What the Legislature says may be done, cannot be set aside by the courts, because they may deem it unreasonable or against sound policy.' 1 Dillon, Mun.

Persons in large numbers pass over it every day &#8212; many of them unacquainted with the surroundings. Moving engines and cars to and fro over such a place makes it one of danger. Any one of several forms of corrective regulation might be applied. To illustrate: The city might call on the railroad company to construct and maintain a viaduct over the crossing or a tunnel under it; or might lay on the company the duty of maintaining watchmen or flagmen at the crossing. What it actually does by the ordinance is to call on the company to remove the track from the crossing and avail itself of other accessible and fairly convenient means of getting cars to and from its track east of the crossing. No doubt in this the company will experience some disadvantages, but they will be far less burdensome than would be the construction and maintenance of a viaduct or tunnel, and not much more so than would be the keeping of watchmen or flagmen at the crossing.</p>\n<p>\"The situation is unusual and the ordinance deals with it in a rather practical way. Giving effect to all that appears, we are unable to say that what is required is plainly unreasonable and arbitrary.\"</p>\n<p>In City of Durham v. Southern Ry. Co., <cross_reference>185 N.C. 240</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>117 S.E. 17</cross_reference>, 35 A.L.R. 1313, the ordinance for the elimination of grade crossings was upheld by the Supreme Court of North Carolina, and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. Southern Ry. Co. v. City of Durham, N.C., <cross_reference>266 U.S. 178</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>45 S.Ct. 51</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>69 L.Ed. 231</cross_reference>. It had been declared by the Supreme Court of North Carolina that the city had exclusive control of its streets, and the question of eliminating grade crossings \"in the first instance was one for the local authorities\"; that is, for the determination by those authorities whether the \"public necessity requires a separation of crossing grades\" and the method of accomplishing it &#8212; \"whether by compelling the railroad (1) to depress its tracks and carry the street over,\" or (2) by raising its tracks and carrying the same over the present grade of the street. In the decisions of these legislative questions the ordinance was held a proper exercise of the police power and authority conferred \"in the city's charter and the several statutes applicable.\" The Supreme Court of the United States stated the issues of fact raised by the pleadings, and treated the questions presented by the appeal in short as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Having heard the cause upon complaint, answers and argument of counsel the trial court, 'being of the opinion that no issue of fact for trial by jury is raised upon the pleadings,' made findings of fact, declared the ordinance valid and directed compliance therewith. The railroads offered no evidence, but asked continuation of the cause until the next term and that no further proceedings should be taken until the issues of fact raised by the answers could be decided by a jury. This was denied and they appealed. The Supreme Court held refusal to continue the hearing and transfer the cause to the civil docket for trial by jury was not erroneous, and said that 'the judge was ready to hear and determine the action but the railroads failed to offer testimony or evidence of any kind whatever.'</p>\n<p>\"We are unable to find that plaintiffs in error have been deprived of any federal right. They had full opportunity to present evidence to support their contentions in the trial court, but offered none.\"</p>\n<p>The city, in that case, had filed a petition for mandamus to compel compliance with the ordinance, and the Southern Railway Company answered, attacking \"the ordinance as arbitrary, unreasonable and subversive of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; also because it conflicted with the federal act to regulate commerce (U.S. Comp. St. &#167; 8563 et seq.) by imposing undue expense upon them. The facts relied upon to support these claims were specified.\"</p>\n<p>In the case of A. T. Co. v. Mo. P. R.

In that case, it appeared that long after the construction of the railroad, the city of Minneapolis had laid out a street across the railroad right of way, building at its own cost a bridge over the railroad tracks. After the bridge had been maintained for several years by the city it was destroyed by fire, and the city then demanded that the railroad company should build a new one. This demand the state court sustained; and, mandamus having thereupon been awarded (<cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Minn.</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></span></cross_reference>\n[<span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></span>]), the case was brought to this court, one of the grounds being that the action of the state deprived the company of its property without due process of law.

Persons in large numbers pass over it every day &#8212; many of them unacquainted with the surroundings. Moving engines and cars to and fro over such a place makes it one of danger. Any one of several forms of corrective regulation might be applied. To illustrate: The city might call on the railroad company to construct and maintain a viaduct over the crossing or a tunnel under it; or might lay on the company the duty of maintaining watchmen or flagmen at the crossing. What it actually does by the ordinance is to call on the company to remove the track from the crossing and avail itself of other accessible and fairly convenient means of getting cars to and from its track east of the crossing. No doubt in this the company will experience some disadvantages, but they will be far less burdensome than would be the construction and maintenance of a viaduct or tunnel, and not much more so than would be the keeping of watchmen or flagmen at the crossing.</p>\n<p>\"The situation is unusual and the ordinance deals with it in a rather practical way.

It had been declared by the Supreme Court of North Carolina that the city had exclusive control of its streets, and the question of eliminating grade crossings \"in the first instance was one for the local authorities\"; that is, for the determination by those authorities whether the \"public necessity requires a separation of crossing grades\" and the method of accomplishing it &#8212; \"whether by compelling the railroad (1) to depress its tracks and carry the street over,\" or (2) by raising its tracks and carrying the same over the present grade of the street. In the decisions of these legislative questions the ordinance was held a proper exercise of the police power and authority conferred \"in the city's charter and the several statutes applicable.\" The Supreme Court of the United States stated the issues of fact raised by the pleadings, and treated the questions presented by the appeal in short as follows:</p>\n<p>\"Having heard the cause upon complaint, answers and argument of counsel the trial court, 'being of the opinion that no issue of fact for trial by jury is raised upon the pleadings,' made findings of fact, declared the ordinance valid and directed compliance therewith. The railroads offered no evidence, but asked continuation of the cause until the next term and that no further proceedings should be taken until the issues of fact raised by the answers could be decided by a jury. This was denied and they appealed. The Supreme Court held refusal to continue the hearing and transfer the cause to the civil docket for trial by jury was not erroneous, and said that 'the judge was ready to hear and determine the action but the railroads failed to offer testimony or evidence of any kind whatever.'</p>\n<p>\"We are unable to find that plaintiffs in error have been deprived of any federal right. They had full opportunity to present evidence to support their contentions in the trial court, but offered none.\"</p>\n<p>The city, in that case, had filed a petition for mandamus to compel compliance with the ordinance, and the Southern Railway Company answered, attacking \"the ordinance as arbitrary, unreasonable and subversive of rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; also because it conflicted with the federal act to regulate commerce (U.S. Comp.

The statute does not limit the action of the city merely to that of a change of the grade of its streets and sidewalks, as is the expressed view of the majority. The statute is comprehensive, and gave authority to duly affect the whole subject-matter, having a right regard to the end in view &#8212; the elimination of unnecessary dangers and hazards at popular street crossings. To this end the municipality may reasonably require, under the statute, the elevation or depression of the grade of the streets and sidewalks, or that of the tracks of the railroad companies, either or both, in whole or in part, at and approaching said crossing and necessary to the elimination of said grade crossing.</p>\n<p>The majority, Justices SAYRE, SOMERVILLE, MILLER, and BOULDIN, concurs in my treatment of the constitutional questions presented and argued.

We were invoked to this on argument that the merits of the controversy be determined. It was further made apparent by the argument that it was the desire of both parties that the respective merits of the controversy be decided, rather than have the appeal determined on any technical ground or question. The respective constitutional and statutory constructions contended for were fully presented. The issue was the validity vel non of three ordinances of the city in its effort and requirements of the railroad companies, declared and required by that municipality necessary in the elimination of dangerous grade crossings within the city. And the majority of this court, on the issue as presented to them by the writer, held that the city was without express authority to so ordain as was done and the decision was against the city on the statute.</p>\n<p>Considering the cases together (6 Division Nos. 522, 523), it was the right and duty of this court to treat the proceeding as one, to determine the validity of the ordinances, whether enacted (1) \"by the governing body of said city in the exercise of its <em>police power as expressly delegated to it</em> by the Legislature\" (section 2070, Code of 1923); or (2) \"by authority of an <em>express</em> legislative grant to the city of power to ordain to the particular effect set forth in said ordinances\" (Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6). The insistence of the city is that the effect of the last-stated act was not developed in the opinion, and to which we should now advert. The authority of the city to pass the ordinances, being treated as resting upon the express declaration of the mode of the exercise of police power to the end in view, and as stated in section 2070 et seq., Code of 1923. In response to the argument of the city, we may say that we should have spoken of the police power as delegated to the municipality in Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6.</p>\n<p>Before proceeding with a discussion of the right to ordain, as was done under the general police power, it should be said that the fact that Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, was a law of general application, and embraced within its classification only the municipality of Birmingham, and was not given a place in the codification of general laws in 1923, did not repeal or render that statute negatory. The saving clause contained in Code 1923, &#167; 11, is sufficient to save that statute from embarrassment, and this was again safeguarded by the provisions of the act adopting the Code. Gen. Acts 1923, p. 127, &#167; 2. See, also, 1 Code, p. vi.</p>\n<p>It should be noted of the legislative history of section 2070 et seq., of the Code of 1923, that the provisions of the Act of 1915 (section 6, p. 296) were the law years before the adoption of the Code of 1923; that is to say, that section 2070 of the Code of 1923 was section 1296 of the Code of 1907, and was taken from section 1 et seq. of Gen. Acts 1907, p. 736. In each of these statutes words are employed, as \"shall have full power and authority to require\" as to construction and maintenance of viaducts, etc., <em>\"over, along or under their tracks at their</em><em>expense,\"</em> and \"or other conveniences at public crossings, and such viaducts, and their approaches <em>over their tracks</em> where the same cross or extend along public highways or streets.\" The only change that was made in codification of section 1 of the Act of August 13, 1907, material to note, was the addition of the word \"own\" in the phrase \"at their expense\" &#8212; reading as it does (in the Codes of 1907 and 1923) \"at their own expense.\" The expressions \"where a viaduct, bridge or tunnel <em>crosses over</em><em>or passes under</em> the tracks of two or more railroad companies,\" and \"that the governing body of the city shall have full power and authority to equitably apportion the costs among the different railroads owning the said tracks,\" as the same appear in section 2072, Code of 1923, are contained in section 1298 of the Code of 1907 and in section 2 of the Acts of 1907, p. 737.</p>\n<p>Addressing our inquiry to the city's right under its general police power, as expressed or delegated by the Legislature to the municipality of Birmingham in Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6, we should observe that it was in the exercise of general police power for the removal of railway tracks from street intersection that resulted in the decision in Denver <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 188</span>  Rio Grande R. Co. v. Denver, <cross_reference>250 U.S. 241</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>39 S.Ct. 450</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>63 L.Ed. 958</cross_reference>. In the last-cited case the several federal authorities are collected and considered at length to sustain the ordinance of removal. It will be observed that in the Denver Case the proceeding was under the general police power of the municipalities of the city and county of Denver, unembarrassed by any general statute of Colorado. The counsel for the city of Birmingham insist that its ordinances were drawn to conform to the Denver decision. However, we are bound by our statutes in the premises.</p>\n<p>It will be noted of the Omnibus Bill that its section 6 of the Acts of 1915, pp. 296, 297, contains a general delegation or recital of power &#8212; that possessed by the city or that from time to time had been delegated thereto. They were to the effect that cities of the class indicated (1) are given or had full authority not inconsistent with organic law to carry into effect \"the powers and duties conferred by law upon such cities\"; (2) to provide for the safety, health, prosperity, and morals of its people, etc.; (3) to prevent and punish offenses to the public; (4) to prevent conflict and ill feeling between the races by passing segregation ordinances; (5) to prevent and punish violations of its ordinances and to compel obedience thereto. The limitations or explanations of the powers thus recited or conferred are stated as follows:</p>\n<p>\"That this section shall not be construed to authorize the forfeiture of franchises granted by State laws or city ordinances without appropriate legal proceedings, and to the ends set out in this section the full, complete and unlimited police powers possessed by the State of Alabama are hereby delegated to such cities and towns as though specifically and in detail set out in this section, in so far as it is possible for the Legislature of Alabama under the Constitution of Alabama and of the United States to delegate such powers, it being expressly declared that nothing contained<em>therein</em> shall be construed as a limitation of or restriction on the police powers <em>heretofore</em> or herein granted to such cities under general or special laws.\"</p>\n<p>It would appear that the use of the word \"therein\" in the foregoing excerpt from section 6 of the Act of 1915 referred to the laws conferring general \"powers\" upon and that defining the \"duties\" of cities of the class thus created, and laws and ordinances granted touching forfeitures of franchises. The words \"heretofore or herein granted,\" as employed in the context, had the meaning and legal effect of a cumulative recital of police powers by that municipality. This is evident from the concluding clause of the Omnibus Bill, which is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"All laws and parts of laws, general and special, in so far as they may be in conflict with any provision of this act, shall be and the same are hereby expressly repealed, but such cities shall continue to have and exercise all rights, authority, powers and jurisdiction which they now have except as in this act otherwise expressly provided, it being the intention of this act <em>to grant cumulative powers to such</em><em>cities.</em>\" (Italics supplied.)

In the opinion of the writer the ordinances of the city of Birmingham are in accord with the delegated police power of the state (delegated by the many terms of the act as fully as possessed by the state) were warranted in the exercise under the provisions of the Omnibus Bill.</p>\n<p>The first ground of demurrer by the city challenged the petition or bill, saying \"that the same is without equity.\" The announced conclusion of the trial court was that demurrer to said pleading as a whole was not well taken and the bill contained equity. It was necessary that we consider this feature of the controversy to determine one phase of the city's appeal. The judgment of the majority was that the express legislative grant was not sufficient to the end declared by said ordinances. If the police power of the city under general law, or that delegated by the terms of section 6 of the Act of 1915, was limited by the express provisions of section 2070 of the Code of 1923, as to the mode of exercise to be employed and given expression in the ordinance, this is conclusive of the city's appeal on that phase of the controversy. The assignment of error to the effect that the demurrer to the bill as a whole should have been sustained is contrary to the conclusion announced by the majority in the construction of the express terms of section 2075 of the Code, and also as to the powers contained in Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 189</span> </p>\n<p>The assignment of error rested on the <em>overruling</em> of the demurrer to the aspect of the original petition seeking relief upon the grounds designated as F of section 30, as follows: \"* * * nevertheless said ordinances are invalid in that they are unreasonable and oppressive, and their effect is to take your petitioner's property without due process of law in violation of both the state and federal Constitution,\" was, in the opinion of the writer, subject to the appropriate demurrer directed thereto; and the paragraph G of section 30, to the aspect of the bill that \"said ordinances are unreasonable and oppressive, in that (as specified) there is no public necessity requiring <em>such separation or elimination</em>,\" in the judgment of the writer, was likewise subject to the appropriate ground of demurrer directed thereto.</p>\n<p>It follows that, from the construction given of the express statute, section 2070 et seq., Code, and of the general police powers of the municipality, they are not sufficient in the opinion of the majority to the expressed purpose and specifications of the ordinances, and that the ordinances are invalid and properly enjoined in the execution. The order heretofore made was inadvertent, and not in accord with the view of the majority, and the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. The rehearing is granted, and judgment of affirmance now entered, in case No. 522, on the ground stated &#8212; that the ordinance is invalid and not authorized by the statutes.</p>\n<p>In the appeal by the Louisville  Nashville Railroad Company, the bill in equity is in like terms and effect; the pleas duly set up the pendency of the first suit and its like effect under the special statutory provision.

We were invoked to this on argument that the merits of the controversy be determined. It was further made apparent by the argument that it was the desire of both parties that the respective merits of the controversy be decided, rather than have the appeal determined on any technical ground or question. The respective constitutional and statutory constructions contended for were fully presented. The issue was the validity vel non of three ordinances of the city in its effort and requirements of the railroad companies, declared and required by that municipality necessary in the elimination of dangerous grade crossings within the city. And the majority of this court, on the issue as presented to them by the writer, held that the city was without express authority to so ordain as was done and the decision was against the city on the statute.</p>\n<p>Considering the cases together (6 Division Nos. 522, 523), it was the right and duty of this court to treat the proceeding as one, to determine the validity of the ordinances, whether enacted (1) \"by the governing body of said city in the exercise of its <em>police power as expressly delegated to it</em> by the Legislature\" (section 2070, Code of 1923); or (2) \"by authority of an <em>express</em> legislative grant to the city of power to ordain to the particular effect set forth in said ordinances\" (Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6). The insistence of the city is that the effect of the last-stated act was not developed in the opinion, and to which we should now advert. The authority of the city to pass the ordinances, being treated as resting upon the express declaration of the mode of the exercise of police power to the end in view, and as stated in section 2070 et seq., Code of 1923. In response to the argument of the city, we may say that we should have spoken of the police power as delegated to the municipality in Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6.</p>\n<p>Before proceeding with a discussion of the right to ordain, as was done under the general police power, it should be said that the fact that Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, was a law of general application, and embraced within its classification only the municipality of Birmingham, and was not given a place in the codification of general laws in 1923, did not repeal or render that statute negatory. The saving clause contained in Code 1923, &#167; 11, is sufficient to save that statute from embarrassment, and this was again safeguarded by the provisions of the act adopting the Code. Gen. Acts 1923, p. 127, &#167; 2. See, also, 1 Code, p. vi.</p>\n<p>It should be noted of the legislative history of section 2070 et seq., of the Code of 1923, that the provisions of the Act of 1915 (section 6, p. 296) were the law years before the adoption of the Code of 1923; that is to say, that section 2070 of the Code of 1923 was section 1296 of the Code of 1907, and was taken from section 1 et seq. of Gen. Acts 1907, p. 736. In each of these statutes words are employed, as \"shall have full power and authority to require\" as to construction and maintenance of viaducts, etc., <em>\"over, along or under their tracks at their</em><em>expense,\"</em> and \"or other conveniences at public crossings, and such viaducts, and their approaches <em>over their tracks</em> where the same cross or extend along public highways or streets.\" The only change that was made in codification of section 1 of the Act of August 13, 1907, material to note, was the addition of the word \"own\" in the phrase \"at their expense\" &#8212; reading as it does (in the Codes of 1907 and 1923) \"at their own expense.\" The expressions \"where a viaduct, bridge or tunnel <em>crosses over</em><em>or passes under</em> the tracks of two or more railroad companies,\" and \"that the governing body of the city shall have full power and authority to equitably apportion the costs among the different railroads owning the said tracks,\" as the same appear in section 2072, Code of 1923, are contained in section 1298 of the Code of 1907 and in section 2 of the Acts of 1907, p. 737.</p>\n<p>Addressing our inquiry to the city's right under its general police power, as expressed or delegated by the Legislature to the municipality of Birmingham in Gen. Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6, we should observe that it was in the exercise of general police power for the removal of railway tracks from street intersection that resulted in the decision in Denver <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 188</span>  Rio Grande R.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span></cross_reference>. In the last-cited case the several federal authorities are collected and considered at length to sustain the ordinance of removal. It will be observed that in the Denver Case the proceeding was under the general police power of the municipalities of the city and county of Denver, unembarrassed by any general statute of Colorado. The counsel for the city of Birmingham insist that its ordinances were drawn to conform to the Denver decision. However, we are bound by our statutes in the premises.</p>\n<p>It will be noted of the Omnibus Bill that its section 6 of the Acts of 1915, pp. 296, 297, contains a general delegation or recital of power &#8212; that possessed by the city or that from time to time had been delegated thereto. They were to the effect that cities of the class indicated (1) are given or had full authority not inconsistent with organic law to carry into effect \"the powers and duties conferred by law upon such cities\"; (2) to provide for the safety, health, prosperity, and morals of its people, etc.; (3) to prevent and punish offenses to the public; (4) to prevent conflict and ill feeling between the races by passing segregation ordinances; (5) to prevent and punish violations of its ordinances and to compel obedience thereto. The limitations or explanations of the powers thus recited or conferred are stated as follows:</p>\n<p>\"That this section shall not be construed to authorize the forfeiture of franchises granted by State laws or city ordinances without appropriate legal proceedings, and to the ends set out in this section the full, complete and unlimited police powers possessed by the State of Alabama are hereby delegated to such cities and towns as though specifically and in detail set out in this section, in so far as it is possible for the Legislature of Alabama under the Constitution of Alabama and of the United States to delegate such powers, it being expressly declared that nothing contained<em>therein</em> shall be construed as a limitation of or restriction on the police powers <em>heretofore</em> or herein granted to such cities under general or special laws.\"</p>\n<p>It would appear that the use of the word \"therein\" in the foregoing excerpt from section 6 of the Act of 1915 referred to the laws conferring general \"powers\" upon and that defining the \"duties\" of cities of the class thus created, and laws and ordinances granted touching forfeitures of franchises. The words \"heretofore or herein granted,\" as employed in the context, had the meaning and legal effect of a cumulative recital of police powers by that municipality. This is evident from the concluding clause of the Omnibus Bill, which is as follows:</p>\n<p>\"All laws and parts of laws, general and special, in so far as they may be in conflict with any provision of this act, shall be and the same are hereby expressly repealed, but such cities shall continue to have and exercise all rights, authority, powers and jurisdiction which they now have except as in this act otherwise expressly provided, it being the intention of this act <em>to grant cumulative powers to such</em><em>cities.</em>\" (Italics supplied.)

The assignment of error to the effect that the demurrer to the bill as a whole should have been sustained is contrary to the conclusion announced by the majority in the construction of the express terms of section 2075 of the Code, and also as to the powers contained in Acts 1915, p. 296, &#167; 6. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 189</span> </p>\n<p>The assignment of error rested on the <em>overruling</em> of the demurrer to the aspect of the original petition seeking relief upon the grounds designated as F of section 30, as follows: \"* * * nevertheless said ordinances are invalid in that they are unreasonable and oppressive, and their effect is to take your petitioner's property without due process of law in violation of both the state and federal Constitution,\" was, in the opinion of the writer, subject to the appropriate demurrer directed thereto; and the paragraph G of section 30, to the aspect of the bill that \"said ordinances are unreasonable and oppressive, in that (as specified) there is no public necessity requiring <em>such separation or elimination</em>,\" in the judgment of the writer, was likewise subject to the appropriate ground of demurrer directed thereto.</p>\n<p>It follows that, from the construction given of the express statute, section 2070 et seq., Code, and of the general police powers of the municipality, they are not sufficient in the opinion of the majority to the expressed purpose and specifications of the ordinances, and that the ordinances are invalid and properly enjoined in the execution.

While in accord with the views as expressed in the foregoing opinion of Justice THOMAS as to the constitutional right of municipalities, when the authority is properly delegated by the Legislature, we do not agree with him as to the validity of the ordinances in question. The ordinances require the elevation of the tracks of the railroads over the respective streets dealt with by the construction of bridges over said streets and the removal of the railroad tracks so as to run over the streets, and in effect require what may be termed an elevated railroad through a considerable section of the city. We are of the opinion, and so hold, that said ordinances are not authorized by the statute, and are therefore invalid. Sections 2070, 2071, and 2072 of the Code of 1923, in dealing with the questions and under which the city must derive its authority to require viaducts, tunnels, etc., and which must be considered in pari materia, indicate a legislative intent to authorize viaducts or bridges over and along and tunnels or underground passageways under the tracks, and not the removal of the track so as to make it go under the street or over the same. The statute nowhere contemplates or authorizes the removal of the railroad track in order to accomplish the purpose for which it was enacted. In other words, the statute clearly means that, where the tracks cross a street, the city may require either a bridge or viaduct constructed over the tracks\" or a tunnel \"under the tracks,\" and, where the tracks extend along a street, it may require a viaduct \"over the tracks\" &#8212; all to the end of carrying the street over or under the tracks and letting the tracks remain as they were. Nor can the city get any comfort from the Act of 1911, p. 373, which, we may concede, but do not hold, may also apply to the ordinance in question.</p>\n<p>While the majority are in accord as to the construction of the statute and the invalidity of the ordinances, the writer does not wish to commit himself to the constitutional question as discussed in the opinion of Justice THOMAS. It may be sound, but I do not think it at all necessary to a decision of this case. In fact, the constitutional question is only raised as against the statute in case it was so construed as to authorize the ordinances, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 187</span> \nand no constitutional point is made against it as presently construed, and I am opposed to committing this court to the constitutionality vel non of an imaginary statute; that is, one which the Legislature may never pass. \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.\"</p>\n<p>Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p>ANDERSON, C.

      "attorneys": "W. J. Wynn and W. Marvin Woodall, both of Birmingham, for appellants.\n\nThe city commission was authorized to adopt the ordinances involved for the elimination of dangerous railroad crossing. American Tob. Co. v. Mo. Pac. R. Co.,  247 Mo. 374 , 157 S.W. 502 ; Southern R. Co. v. Morris,  143 Ala. 628 ,  42 So. 17 ,  19 ; State v. Great Northern R.

The police power of the municipality to eliminate dangerous railroad crossings is continuing, and may be exercised as to crossings laid out either before or after the railroad is laid, and without regard to the financial burden upon the railroad. Erie R. Co. v. Board of Pub. Util. Comm.,  254 U.S. 394 , 41 S.Ct. 169 ,  65 L.Ed. 322 ; C., M.  St. P. R. Co. v. City of Minneapolis,  232 U.S. 430 ,  34 S.Ct. 400 ,  58 L.Ed. 671 ; Cleveland v.

R. Co., supra. The action of the city commission being legislative, and the power being expressly granted, the courts have no voice in the matter of the expendiency, necessity, reasonableness, or policy of the act. City of Birmingham v. L.  N., supra; Durham v. Southern R. Co.,  185 N.C. 240 ,  117 S.E. 17 , 35 A.L.R. 1313; 7 McQuillin Mun. Corp. &#167;&#167; 724, 955; State ex rel. v. C., M.

Where a statute violates neither the state nor federal Constitution, the courts cannot declare it unreasonable or oppressive. 36 Cyc. 971; McNeil v. Webeking,  66 Fla. 407 , 63 So. 728 ; Ex parte Birmingham,  199 Ala. 9 ,  74 So. 51 ; Ex parte Lambert,  52 Ala. 79 ; Bouchelle v. State Highway Comm.,  211 Ala. 474 , 100 So. 884 ; Ala. Int. P. Co. v. Mt. Vernon Co.,  186 Ala. 622 , 65 So. 287 ; State v. Skeggs,  154 Ala. 249 ,  46 So. 268 . The burden is upon the party attacking an ordinance to show unreasonableness or oppressiveness. Briggs v. B. R. L.  P. Co.,  188 Ala. 262 ,  66 So. 95 . The aspects of the petition to which demurrer was sustained by the trial court are not before this court for any purpose; no appeal having been taken or cross-errors assigned by appellee. Pollak v. Stouts Mountain Coal Co.,  184 Ala. 331 ,  63 So. 531 ; Sandlin v. Anders,  210 Ala. 396 , 98 So. 299 . The Act of 1911, p. 374, does not repeal or amend section 2070 et seq. of the Code 1923; the powers thereby given are merely cumulative. Schmidt v. City of Milwaukee, 149 Wis. 367 ,  135 N.W. 883 ; Cloverdale Homes v. Cloverdale, 182 Ala. 419 ,  62 So. 712 , 47 L.R.A. (N.S.) 607.\n\nStokely, Scrivner, Dominick  Smith and McClellan, Rice \nStone, all of Birmingham, and Jones  Thomas, of Montgomery, for appellee.\n\nWhere the equity of the bill rests upon several separate and distinct grounds, a demurrer to the bill as a whole for the want of equity should be overruled, if any one of said grounds contains equity. Robinson v. Griffin,  173 Ala. 372 ,  56 So. 124 ; Jones v. Barker,  163 Ala. 632 ,  50 So. 890 ; Beall v. Lehman, Durr Co.,  110 Ala. 446 ,  18 So. 230 . Since the tracks were built at the points in question before Birmingham became a city and before the streets were laid out across said tracks, section 2070 of the Code is not to be interpreted as applying to such a case. 33 Cyc. 270, 285; Albia v. Chicago R. Co., 102 Iowa, 624 ,  71 N.W. 541 ; O'Fallon v. Ohio R. Co.,  45 Ill. App. 572 ; Northern Cent. v. Baltimore,  46 Md. 425 ; State v. Wilmington R. Co.,  74 N.C. 143 ; Prairie County v. Fink,  65 Ark. 492 , 47 S.W. 301 ; Rock Creek Tp. v. St. Jos. R. Co.,  43 Kan. 543 ,  23 P. 585 . Said section 2070 has been amended so far as Birmingham is concerned. Acts 1911, p. 374. If section 2070 should be interpreted as applying where the city itself has created the crossing, it would be violative of section 235 of the Constitution. Birmingham Co. v. Birmingham Co.,  119 Ala. 129 , 24 So. 368 ; Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Bloomington,  76 Ill. 447 ; State v. Shardlow,  43 Minn. 524 ,  46 N.W. 74 ; State v. Hennepin Co. Dist. Ct.,  42 Minn. 247 ,  44 N.W. 7 , 7 L.R.A. 21; Mass. R. Co. v. Boston R. Co.,  121 Mass. 124 ; Chicago R. Co. v. Commrs., 49 Kan. 763 ,  31 P. 736 . The enforcement of the ordinance in question would require the abandonment by the railroad company to the city of the surface of its right of way, without compensation to the railroad company. Niehaus v. Cooke, 134 Ala. 223 ,  32 So. 728 ; Montgomery v. Maddox,  89 Ala. 181 , 7 So. 433 ; Avondale v. McFarland,  101 Ala. 381 ,  13 So. 504 ; Montgomery v. Lemle,  121 Ala. 609 ,  25 So. 919 . The ordinance in question is invalid because neither section 2070 nor any other statute of the state confers upon the municipality the power or authority to pass an ordinance requiring railroad companies to eliminate grade crossings in the manner here attempted, by elevating their tracks.
