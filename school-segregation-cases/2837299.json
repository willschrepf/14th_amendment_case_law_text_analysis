Plaintiff-Appellant S. James Zafirau, a public employee with the Cleveland\n\nSchool District, appeals the grant of summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Cleveland Municipal\n\nSchool District in his action for breach of contract. The district court, on a motion for summary\n\njudgment, dismissed the claim based upon Zafirau’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nprior to bringing this suit. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court’s ruling.\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n        Zafirau’s breach of contract claim arises from the desegregation of the Cleveland Public\n\nSchools, ordered by Judge Frank Battisti in 1976. The parties to the suit, pursuant to Judge Battisti’s\n\norder, created a comprehensive plan through settlement conferences, including educational programs\n\nand methods to assess compliance. In 1994, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which was\n\napproved and converted into an enforceable consent decree. In 1995, and in light of poor financial\n\nconditions, Circuit Judge Robert Krupansky, sitting on the district court by designation, ordered the\n\nState of Ohio Superintendent of Schools to take control of the Cleveland School District’s day-to-day\n\noperations. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3311.71 (converting a school district placed under state control\n\nby a federal court into a “municipal school district”). In March 1998, Chief Judge George White of\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held that the School District had\n\nsubstantially complied with the remedial orders and consent decree and eliminated the effects of\n\nsegregation to the extent practicable. He therefore granted the School District unitary status, in effect\n\nreleasing it from state control. Under the provisions of § 3311.71, when a school district is released\n\nfrom state control, a new board of education is appointed by the mayor to take control. Accordingly,\n\n“the treasurer, business manager, superintendent, assistant superintendents, and other administrators\n\nof the school district shall submit their resignations to the board.” Ohio Rev. Code § 3311.72(A)\n\n(emphasis added). Following the resignations, the appointed Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)\n\nappoints any administrators he or she determines to be necessary to serve “at the pleasure” of the\n\nCEO. Ohio Rev. Code § 3311.72(C)-(D). In this instance, Louis Erste was appointed interim CEO\n\nwhen the state relinquished control of the Cleveland Schools on September 9, 1998.\n\n                                                   2\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n        Dr. S. James Zafirau obtained his Ph.D. in psychology from Notre Dame in 1975. In 1980,\n\nhe became employed by the Board of Education of the Cleveland City School District. He was\n\noriginally employed as a “Consultant Teacher.” His title changed in or around 1983 to “Supervisor”\n\nin the “Policy Planning and Analysis Section.” In May 1983, he entered into a “teacher’s continuing\n\ncontract” with the School District. Pursuant to his contract, Zafirau would be “employed in the\n\npublic schools of the [School District] until, in accordance with law, [he] resigns, elects to retire, is\n\nretired, or until, as provided by law, this contract is amended, terminated or suspended.” He further\n\nagreed to complete those duties and obligations, including teaching, required under the agreement\n\nreached between the School District and the Cleveland Teachers Union (CTU), irrespective of the\n\n“unusual nature” of his assignment. The contract recognized him as a “certificated employee\n\nworking a classified position.”\n\n        In early September 1998, a number of Zafirau’s colleagues working in the District’s\n\nadministrative building began receiving letters from CEO Erste informing them that their\n\nresignations were required by law, and on September 9, 1998, they would be offered “at-will”\n\nemployment contracts along with “other employees whose resignations [were] mandated by statute.”\n\nThe letter also stated that if one did not submit a letter for resignation by the deadline, the Board\n\nwould deem that the resignation had been submitted anyway.\n\n        Zafirau did not receive a letter like his colleagues, but he was unsure whether this was\n\npurposeful or an oversight. Accordingly, he conducted his own legal research on the definition of\n\nhis employment to determine whether he was an “other administrator” required to tender his\n\nresignation. Upon reviewing the sections, he determined that he was not an “other administrator”\n\n                                                   3\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nbecause he was not a “supervisor” or “management level employee” as defined by Ohio Revised\n\nCode §§ 4117.01(F) and (L). Rather, he considered himself a “professional employee” as defined\n\nin Ohio Revised Code § 4117.01(J). Zafirau wrote a letter to the Board of Education setting forth\n\nhis understanding of the statutory language on September 8, 1998. On September 10, 1998, he\n\nexecuted his at-will employment contract. Zafirau added an addendum to his contract, which stated\n\nin relevant part:\n\n        I thoughtfully and respectfully submit that I do not believe that I am required to\n        submit a resignation or an ‘At Will Employment Contract’ . . . (as detailed in my\n        prior September 8, 1998 dated letter, also attached hereto). I submit the above\n        conditioned signature to this ‘contract’ subject to the following two understandings:\n        (1) Said signature is valid only if I am required to submit the same under a definitive\n        and clear legal determination that H.B. 269 . . . requires that a person with my\n        restricted authority and functioning (i.e., no fiscal, personnel, or policy making\n        authority, only intellectual contribution responsibilities — with no certificate\n        required) submit a resignation, and (2) That I hereby forward my\n        conditioned/provisional signature only under extreme duress not of my making and\n        only under clear written threat of termination and/or of at least being taken off of the\n        payroll. Furthermore, in no case is this signature to be construed as a resignation\n        from my tenured/continuing contract status within the school district. I have earned\n        and still hold tenure/continuing contract status in the Cleveland City/Municipal\n        School District, and under no circumstances do I give up my tenure/continuing\n        contract rights as either a teacher . . . or those I have similarly earned and hold as a\n        classified/civil service employee.\n\nNo one at the Board responded to Zafirau’s September 8 letter or his addendum to the executed at-\n\nwill employment contract. Erste, as CEO of the Board, executed all contracts, including Zafirau’s,\n\nprior to circulating them to employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n        Zafirau continued working for the School District in the same capacity he had before\n\nexecuting the at-will contract.1 On October 2, 1998, Zafirau was called into a meeting with his boss,\n\nDr. James Lanese, where they were both discharged by Chief Academic Officer Dr. Livesteen Carter.\n\nCarter gave the two men letters from Erste. Zafirau’s letter stated that his at-will administrative\n\ncontract was terminated upon the recommendation of Carter, that he would be immediately escorted\n\nfrom the building upon gathering his personal belongings, and that he would not be permitted to\n\nreturn. Zafirau brought up the fact that he had a continuing teaching contract and asked Carter where\n\nhe should report for work on Monday. Carter responded she was not at liberty to discuss this matter\n\nwith him. Security guards thereafter escorted him from the building.\n\n        On October 5, 1998, Zafirau contacted the human resources department to inquire about open\n\nteaching positions in the School District. They would not inform him of any open positions. He\n\nthen contacted the Continuing Teachers Union (“CTU”), who did give him a list of schools with\n\npositions. Zafirau inquired about an open teaching position at Lincoln-West High School; the school\n\nprincipal said he could fill it.\n\n        On October 13, 1998, Zafirau wrote a handwritten letter to the Civil Service Commission\n\nformally complaining of his discharge, asserting his status as a classified civil servant, and contesting\n\nhis “at-will” employment because he was not an administrative employee. According to Zafirau, the\n\nCommission never followed up on his complaint or filed a grievance on his behalf.\n\n\n\n        1\n        During this period, several statements were made which caused Zafirau, 58, to later believe\nhe was discharged because of his age. However, because the age discrimination claim was not raised\non appeal to this court, these facts are not set forth in detail here.\n\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n        During this same time period, a security guard allegedly witnessed Zafirau repeatedly peering\n\ninto the window of the administrative building towards Chief Legal Counsel Lisa Ruda’s office, and\n\nwalking around the building at night. Zafirau concedes that he continued going to the Cleveland\n\nPublic Library across from the administrative building every day to “maintain” his pattern, but denies\n\nthat he ever peered into Ruda’s window or exhibited any other strange behavior to justify a\n\npsychological examination.\n\n        On October 21, 1998, Russell Gifford, the Chief Operating Officer of the District, wrote a\n\nletter to Zafirau indicating that he had been recommended for a job at Lincoln-West teaching\n\nmathematics. The letter requested that he respond no later than October 26, 1998, with his intention\n\nto accept or decline the position. Zafirau indicates that he did not receive the letter, as the letter was\n\nsent to the wrong address. Nevertheless, on October 29, 1998, Zafirau wrote a letter to Gifford,\n\nindicating that he received the offer letter on the 29th and that he accepted the teaching position. On\n\nOctober 30, 1998, Gifford wrote another letter to Zafirau, again offering the position, only this time\n\nthe letter contained the following additional condition:\n\n        This teaching position is contingent on your passing a medical examination which\n        has been scheduled for 1:00 p.m. on November 1, 1998, at the MetroHealth Medical\n        Center on 2500 MetroHealth Drive. We are concerned for the health, safety and\n        welfare of our students in light of the behavior that we have observed since the\n        District terminated your administrative employment contract on October 2, 1998. In\n        particular, the District has observed you loitering around the administration building\n        during late evening hours. We have also observed you peering into office windows\n        during your visits.\n\nThe letter requested his acceptance by November 4, 1998. The letter was postmarked November 2,\n\n1998; Zafirau did not receive it until November 6, 1998.\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n       The other eight employees whose at-will contracts were terminated but who still held\n\ncontinuing teacher’s contracts were offered classroom teaching positions, and none were conditioned\n\non the successful completion of fitness for duty examinations. Zafirau, through his attorney,\n\nnegotiated the details of the psychological exam but never actually completed it. Correspondence\n\nconcerning the medical examination ended in February 1999, around the same time that Zafirau’s\n\nattorney stopped representing him due to Zafirau’s inability to pay fees.\n\n       Zafirau never completed the examination, and the School District never placed Zafirau in a\n\nteaching position. Nevertheless, the School District asserts that it did not terminate Zafirau’s\n\nemployment. From October 1998 until January 1999, Zafirau was not paid. The CTU filed a\n\nseparate grievance on behalf of a group of teachers laid off for a period during the restructuring\n\nconcerning non-payment during that period. Zafirau was included in this class action even though\n\nhis teaching position was somewhat unique. The CTU reached a settlement on behalf of Zafirau and\n\nothers on September 20, 1999. The “Stipulated Award” was entered by an arbitrator and provided\n\nthat, within 45 days of that date, all grievants would be “placed on and receive compensation per the\n\nTeacher’s Salary Schedule based on years of completed Cleveland Municipal School district service\n\n(administrative and teaching) and/or continuing contract status.” Thereafter, Zafirau received a\n\ncheck on October 29, 1999, for his total net unpaid compensation from October 2, 1998 to December\n\n31, 1998.\n\n       Zafirau received bi-weekly checks from the School District beginning in January 1999 and\n\ncontinuing until October 29, 1999. He received an additional payment in November 1999 for an\n\nadjustment in salary corresponding to his previous payments. He received a final “supplemental\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\npay” check on December 24, 1999. Zafirau has not been paid since, nor has he received any\n\nnotification as to why the payments stopped. In November 1999, Zafirau contacted the School\n\nDistrict’s payroll department about his missing checks. He was informed that the checks had been\n\nconfiscated by Ruda. He has not received a W-2 form from the School District since 1998. The\n\nSchool District asserts that he has not been terminated; rather his pay has been suspended until his\n\npsychological examination is completed. Zafirau contends that he never received notification of\n\nsuch action, nor has he been notified again about a psychological examination. Zafirau alleges that,\n\nafter his compensation ended, he “went to the CTU to inquire and complain about the fact and was\n\ntold, basically, that they would not file any more grievances for [him].” Zafirau has subsequently\n\nobtained work in the Toledo Public Schools as a guidance counselor.\n\n        Zafirau filed an original complaint against the School District in the Court of Common Pleas\n\nof Cuyahoga County on October 2, 2000. The case was subsequently dismissed without prejudice\n\nbecause a settlement had been reached. However, Zafirau filed a motion for relief asserting that a\n\nsettlement had not been reached in November 2002. Zafirau then dismissed his own motion and\n\nrefiled the case anew on December 20, 2002. The School District opted to remove the case to the\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In Zafirau’s amended complaint\n\nbefore the district court, he asserted the following claims against the School District: (1) that it\n\nviolated his due process rights by denying him his constitutionally protected property interest in his\n\nclassified position and his continuing contract with the District; (2) that it discriminated against him\n\non the basis of his age (including a claim against Carter specifically), in violation of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA); (3) that it discriminated against him based upon his\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nhearing handicap; (4) that it unlawfully retaliated against him for asserting disability claims; and (5)\n\nthat the District “breached the continuing contract by failing to put [him] in a teaching position after\n\nhe was discharged on October 2, 1998 from the classified position.” Additionally, Zafirau asserted\n\na state-law invasion of privacy claim against Ruda individually.\n\n        On May 2, 2003, the School District, along with Ruda and Carter, moved to dismiss the\n\namended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). The district court\n\ngranted in part the motion, dismissing the due process and invasion of privacy claims on December\n\n10, 2003. On May 6, 2004, the School District filed a motion for summary judgment as to all\n\nremaining claims. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, who prepared a report\n\non August 27, 2004, recommending that the district court grant the School District summary\n\njudgment as to the discrimination claims but deny the motion as to the breach of contract claim and\n\nretain jurisdiction over the matter. Each party filed objections, and, on March 31, 2005, the district\n\ncourt granted the School District’s summary judgment motion as to the retaliation claim, disability\n\nclaim, and dismissed the breach of contract claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because\n\nZafirau failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The district court denied the motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to the age discrimination claim based upon the School District’s failure to\n\nprovide a proper witness for examination. However, upon further review and subsequent discovery,\n\nthe district court granted the School District’s motion for summary judgment as to the age\n\ndiscrimination claim on October 28, 2009. Zafirau timely appealed to this court, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing his breach of contract claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\n         We review a district court’s decision regarding subject matter jurisdiction de novo. Grand\n\nTrunk W. R.R. Inc. v. Bhd. of Maint. of Way Emps. Div., 497 F.3d 568, 571 (6th Cir. 2007). Whether\n\nthe court has subject matter jurisdiction is an issue that may be raised at any time, as it goes to the\n\npower of the court to adjudicate the merits of the case. United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 630\n\n(2002). Here, the district court raised the issue while considering the School District’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. While the district court had supplemental jurisdiction to consider the breach\n\nof contract claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, it abstained from reaching the merits of the claim\n\nbecause Zafirau failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing this suit.\n\n         When a public employee and an employer have entered into a collective bargaining\n\nagreement and a dispute arises, Ohio Revised Code § 4117 controls. State ex rel. Ramsdell v.\n\nWashington Local Sch. Bd., 556 N.E.2d 197, 200 (Ohio Ct. App. 1988). If a party’s claims “arise\n\nfrom or depend on the collective bargaining rights created by [Ohio Revised Code] Chapter 4117,\n\nthe remedies provided in that chapter are exclusive.” Franklin Cnty. Law Enforcement Ass’n v.\n\nFraternal Order of Police, 572 N.E.2d 87, 91 (Ohio 1991). Chapter 4117 “provides that if a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, public\n\nemployers, employees, and employee organizations are subject solely to that grievance procedure.”\n\nBlair v. Milford Exempted Vill. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 575 N.E.2d 1190, 1197 (Ohio Ct. App.\n\n1989).\n\n         If an appellant believes a grievance was not properly pursued by the State Commissioners\n\nor the Union, that complaint is essentially an allegation of an unfair labor practice pursuant to Ohio\n\n                                                  10\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nRevised Code § 4117.11(B). Shamrock v. Trumbull Cnty. Comm’rs, 593 N.E.2d 28, 31 (Ohio Ct.\n\nApp. 1990). Under § 4117.11(B) (2010),\n\n       [i]t is an unfair labor practice for an employee organization, its agents, or\n       representatives, or public employees to: (1) Restrain or coerce employees in the\n       exercise of their rights guaranteed in Chapter 4117 . . . ; [or] (3) Refuse to bargain\n       collectively with a public employer if the employee organization is recognized as the\n       exclusive representative or certified as the exclusive representative of public\n       employees in a bargaining unit; . . . [or] (6) Fail to fairly represent all public\n       employees in a bargaining unit[.]\n\nAdditionally, as acts which constitute unfair labor practices under § 4117 are subject to the exclusive\n\njurisdiction of the State Employment Relations Board (“SERB”), the courts cannot review such\n\nclaims on primary jurisdiction. Shamrock, 593 N.E.2d at 30-31; Franklin Cnty. Law Enforcement\n\nAss’n, 572 N.E.2d at 90. SERB, not the courts, resolve unfair labor practice charges in two general\n\nareas: “(1) where one of the parties filed charges with SERB alleging an unfair labor practice under\n\nR.C. § 4117.11 and (2) where a complaint brought before the common pleas court alleges conduct\n\nthat constitutes an unfair labor practice specifically enumerated in R.C. § 4117.11.” State ex rel.\n\nOhio Dep’t of Mental Health v. Nadel, 786 N.E.2d 49, 54 (Ohio 2003). An appellant may only seek\n\nrelief from the courts after he or she has exhausted the administrative remedy provided through\n\nSERB. Shamrock, 593 N.E.2d at 31.\n\n       Here, Zafirau agreed in his continuing teaching contract to representation by the CTU.\n\nAdditionally, he submitted himself to the representation of the CTU when he agreed to the Stipulated\n\nAward bargained for by the CTU on behalf of aggrieved teachers laid off during the transition period\n\nfrom state to municipal authority in 1998, despite his unique employment situation. Accordingly,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement (“Agreement”) between the School District and the CTU\n\ncontrols Zafirau’s claim.\n\n        The Agreement, effective from September 1, 1996 through August 31, 1999 (during which\n\nperiod Zafirau alleges injury due to his being terminated in October 1998 in violation of his\n\ncontinuing teacher’s contract), defines a grievance as “any matter concerning the interpretation,\n\napplication, or alleged violation of any currently effective Agreement between the District and the\n\nCTU, or which alleges any employee represented by the Union has been discharged or disciplined\n\nwithout just cause, or has been treated unfairly or in a discriminatory manner.” The Agreement\n\nfurther states that “[n]othing shall preclude the Union or an individual from the right to file an Unfair\n\nLabor Practice in accordance with Ohio Revised Code 4117.”\n\n        All of Zafirau’s alleged injuries on appeal arise in relation to his rights guaranteed by his\n\ncontract and are dependent upon the Agreement he entered upon accepting the position with the\n\nSchool District. The Agreement guaranteed him employment. Accordingly, Zafirau alleges that the\n\nSchool District’s requirement that he subject himself to a psychological examination before working\n\nviolates this Agreement.\n\n        On appeal to this court, Zafirau does not dispute that he has not exhausted his contractual\n\nremedies in failing to file a grievance with SERB. Rather, he argues that any attempt to file a\n\ngrievance with the CTU and follow the grievance procedure would be futile, as both the CTU and\n\nthe Commissioners already expressed disinterest or even hostility towards his previous attempts to\n\nbring a grievance forward. However, the issue of futility does not pertain to Zafirau’s relief through\n\nSERB. He has not sought relief from the union’s alleged unfair labor practice, nor has he even\n\n                                                   12\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\npursued a grievance concerning the School District’s requirement that he submit to a psychological\n\nexamination in order to work as a teacher pursuant to his Stipulated Award. This court cannot\n\nspeculate on the result of such proper complaints. Accordingly, futility cannot avoid the requirement\n\nthat Zafirau must first exhaust his contractual remedies before seeking relief in court. See Fasone\n\nv. Clinton Twp., No. 97APE06-845, 1997 WL 710584, at *2 (Ohio Ct. App. 1997) (“[E]ven if\n\nappellant’s efforts during the grievance procedure were arguably in vain, the proper course of action\n\nwas still to file a charge with SERB. Hence, the failure-to-exhaust rule and its accompanying\n\nexception do not even apply here.”); Shamrock, 593 N.E.2d at 31 (“[I]f appellants believe that the\n\ngrievance was wrongfully withdrawn and the Commissioners wrongfully refused to arbitrate, then\n\nappellants must pursue the alleged unfair labor practices through SERB pursuant to R.C. Chapter\n\n4117, prior to appealing to this court.”).\n\n        Zafirau attempts to avoid the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies by reframing the\n\nissue on appeal as whether the district court has jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award\n\nnegotiated by the CTU on his behalf, in that the Stipulated Award indicated that he would be\n\nemployed within forty-five days and did not explicitly require a psychological examination as a\n\nprerequisite to his employment. This argument is not only waived because Zafirau failed to raise it\n\nbelow, but is unpersuasive. See Armstrong v. City of Melvindale, 432 F.3d 695, 700 (6th Cir. 2006)\n\n(“It is well-settled that this court’s function is to review the case presented to the district court, rather\n\nthan a better case fashioned after an unfavorable order.” (internal punctuation and citation omitted)).\n\nThe Stipulated Award guaranteed that Zafirau would be employed by the School District. The\n\nSchool District did attempt to employ Zafirau in the appropriate time frame subject to the additional\n\n                                                     13\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nrequirement that he complete the psychological examination. The terms of Zafirau’s employment\n\nwere guaranteed by the Agreement. That the School District required the psychological examination,\n\nhowever, arguably amounted to an unfair labor practice on the part of the School District against\n\nZafirau by interfering with his ability to teach. See Ohio Rev. Code § 4117.11(A)(1) (“It is an unfair\n\nlabor practice for a public employer, its agents, or representatives to: (1) interfere with, restrain, or\n\ncoerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed under Chapter 4117.”). Such a practice\n\nshould be grieved by Zafirau to, or through, the CTU or directly to SERB prior to filing suit in court.\n\nAccordingly, as Zafirau’s claim stemmed from a grievance originating from his rights guaranteed\n\nby the Agreement, any attempt to consider this as a matter of arbitration enforcement disguises the\n\nunderlying issue.\n\n        Finally, because we do not reach the merits of Zafirau’s breach of contract claim, we need\n\nnot address the issue of whether Zafirau appealed from his continuing teacher’s contract alone, or\n\nif he additionally appealed from breach of his classified status as well. We have previously held that\n\n“if a court does not have jurisdiction, ipso facto, it cannot address the merits of a case.” Charter\n\nTwp. of Muskegon v. City of Muskegon, 303 F.3d 755, 764 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Rogers v.\n\nStratton Indus. Inc., 798 F.2d 913, 917 (6th Cir. 1986)). Accordingly, we abstain from reaching the\n\nmerits of this claim as well.\n\n                                           CONCLUSION\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Zafirau’s breach of\n\ncontract claim because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing his claims in\n\nthe lower court.\n\n                                                   14\n\f",

Plaintiff-Appellant S.

The district court, on a motion for summary\n\njudgment, dismissed the claim based upon Zafirau’s failure to exhaust his administrative remedies\n\nprior to bringing this suit. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM the district court’s ruling.\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n        Zafirau’s breach of contract claim arises from the desegregation of the Cleveland Public\n\nSchools, ordered by Judge Frank Battisti in 1976. The parties to the suit, pursuant to Judge Battisti’s\n\norder, created a comprehensive plan through settlement conferences, including educational programs\n\nand methods to assess compliance. In 1994, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which was\n\napproved and converted into an enforceable consent decree. In 1995, and in light of poor financial\n\nconditions, Circuit Judge Robert Krupansky, sitting on the district court by designation, ordered the\n\nState of Ohio Superintendent of Schools to take control of the Cleveland School District’s day-to-day\n\noperations. See Ohio Rev. Code § 3311.71 (converting a school district placed under state control\n\nby a federal court into a “municipal school district”). In March 1998, Chief Judge George White of\n\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio held that the School District had\n\nsubstantially complied with the remedial orders and consent decree and eliminated the effects of\n\nsegregation to the extent practicable. He therefore granted the School District unitary status, in effect\n\nreleasing it from state control. Under the provisions of § 3311.71, when a school district is released\n\nfrom state control, a new board of education is appointed by the mayor to take control. Accordingly,\n\n“the treasurer, business manager, superintendent, assistant superintendents, and other administrators\n\nof the school district shall submit their resignations to the board.” Ohio Rev. Code § 3311.72(A)\n\n(emphasis added). Following the resignations, the appointed Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)\n\nappoints any administrators he or she determines to be necessary to serve “at the pleasure” of the\n\nCEO. Ohio Rev. Code § 3311.72(C)-(D). In this instance, Louis Erste was appointed interim CEO\n\nwhen the state relinquished control of the Cleveland Schools on September 9, 1998.\n\n                                                   2\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n        Dr. S. James Zafirau obtained his Ph.D. in psychology from Notre Dame in 1975. In 1980,\n\nhe became employed by the Board of Education of the Cleveland City School District. He was\n\noriginally employed as a “Consultant Teacher.” His title changed in or around 1983 to “Supervisor”\n\nin the “Policy Planning and Analysis Section.” In May 1983, he entered into a “teacher’s continuing\n\ncontract” with the School District. Pursuant to his contract, Zafirau would be “employed in the\n\npublic schools of the [School District] until, in accordance with law, [he] resigns, elects to retire, is\n\nretired, or until, as provided by law, this contract is amended, terminated or suspended.” He further\n\nagreed to complete those duties and obligations, including teaching, required under the agreement\n\nreached between the School District and the Cleveland Teachers Union (CTU), irrespective of the\n\n“unusual nature” of his assignment. The contract recognized him as a “certificated employee\n\nworking a classified position.”\n\n        In early September 1998, a number of Zafirau’s colleagues working in the District’s\n\nadministrative building began receiving letters from CEO Erste informing them that their\n\nresignations were required by law, and on September 9, 1998, they would be offered “at-will”\n\nemployment contracts along with “other employees whose resignations [were] mandated by statute.”\n\nThe letter also stated that if one did not submit a letter for resignation by the deadline, the Board\n\nwould deem that the resignation had been submitted anyway.\n\n        Zafirau did not receive a letter like his colleagues, but he was unsure whether this was\n\npurposeful or an oversight. Accordingly, he conducted his own legal research on the definition of\n\nhis employment to determine whether he was an “other administrator” required to tender his\n\nresignation. Upon reviewing the sections, he determined that he was not an “other administrator”\n\n                                                   3\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nbecause he was not a “supervisor” or “management level employee” as defined by Ohio Revised\n\nCode §§ 4117.01(F) and (L). Rather, he considered himself a “professional employee” as defined\n\nin Ohio Revised Code § 4117.01(J). Zafirau wrote a letter to the Board of Education setting forth\n\nhis understanding of the statutory language on September 8, 1998. On September 10, 1998, he\n\nexecuted his at-will employment contract. Zafirau added an addendum to his contract, which stated\n\nin relevant part:\n\n        I thoughtfully and respectfully submit that I do not believe that I am required to\n        submit a resignation or an ‘At Will Employment Contract’ . . . (as detailed in my\n        prior September 8, 1998 dated letter, also attached hereto). I submit the above\n        conditioned signature to this ‘contract’ subject to the following two understandings:\n        (1) Said signature is valid only if I am required to submit the same under a definitive\n        and clear legal determination that H.B. 269 . . . requires that a person with my\n        restricted authority and functioning (i.e., no fiscal, personnel, or policy making\n        authority, only intellectual contribution responsibilities — with no certificate\n        required) submit a resignation, and (2) That I hereby forward my\n        conditioned/provisional signature only under extreme duress not of my making and\n        only under clear written threat of termination and/or of at least being taken off of the\n        payroll. Furthermore, in no case is this signature to be construed as a resignation\n        from my tenured/continuing contract status within the school district. I have earned\n        and still hold tenure/continuing contract status in the Cleveland City/Municipal\n        School District, and under no circumstances do I give up my tenure/continuing\n        contract rights as either a teacher . . . or those I have similarly earned and hold as a\n        classified/civil service employee.\n\nNo one at the Board responded to Zafirau’s September 8 letter or his addendum to the executed at-\n\nwill employment contract. Erste, as CEO of the Board, executed all contracts, including Zafirau’s,\n\nprior to circulating them to employees.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n        Zafirau continued working for the School District in the same capacity he had before\n\nexecuting the at-will contract.1 On October 2, 1998, Zafirau was called into a meeting with his boss,\n\nDr. James Lanese, where they were both discharged by Chief Academic Officer Dr. Livesteen Carter.\n\nCarter gave the two men letters from Erste. Zafirau’s letter stated that his at-will administrative\n\ncontract was terminated upon the recommendation of Carter, that he would be immediately escorted\n\nfrom the building upon gathering his personal belongings, and that he would not be permitted to\n\nreturn. Zafirau brought up the fact that he had a continuing teaching contract and asked Carter where\n\nhe should report for work on Monday. Carter responded she was not at liberty to discuss this matter\n\nwith him. Security guards thereafter escorted him from the building.\n\n        On October 5, 1998, Zafirau contacted the human resources department to inquire about open\n\nteaching positions in the School District. They would not inform him of any open positions. He\n\nthen contacted the Continuing Teachers Union (“CTU”), who did give him a list of schools with\n\npositions. Zafirau inquired about an open teaching position at Lincoln-West High School; the school\n\nprincipal said he could fill it.\n\n        On October 13, 1998, Zafirau wrote a handwritten letter to the Civil Service Commission\n\nformally complaining of his discharge, asserting his status as a classified civil servant, and contesting\n\nhis “at-will” employment because he was not an administrative employee. According to Zafirau, the\n\nCommission never followed up on his complaint or filed a grievance on his behalf.\n\n\n\n        1\n        During this period, several statements were made which caused Zafirau, 58, to later believe\nhe was discharged because of his age. However, because the age discrimination claim was not raised\non appeal to this court, these facts are not set forth in detail here.\n\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n        During this same time period, a security guard allegedly witnessed Zafirau repeatedly peering\n\ninto the window of the administrative building towards Chief Legal Counsel Lisa Ruda’s office, and\n\nwalking around the building at night. Zafirau concedes that he continued going to the Cleveland\n\nPublic Library across from the administrative building every day to “maintain” his pattern, but denies\n\nthat he ever peered into Ruda’s window or exhibited any other strange behavior to justify a\n\npsychological examination.\n\n        On October 21, 1998, Russell Gifford, the Chief Operating Officer of the District, wrote a\n\nletter to Zafirau indicating that he had been recommended for a job at Lincoln-West teaching\n\nmathematics. The letter requested that he respond no later than October 26, 1998, with his intention\n\nto accept or decline the position. Zafirau indicates that he did not receive the letter, as the letter was\n\nsent to the wrong address. Nevertheless, on October 29, 1998, Zafirau wrote a letter to Gifford,\n\nindicating that he received the offer letter on the 29th and that he accepted the teaching position. On\n\nOctober 30, 1998, Gifford wrote another letter to Zafirau, again offering the position, only this time\n\nthe letter contained the following additional condition:\n\n        This teaching position is contingent on your passing a medical examination which\n        has been scheduled for 1:00 p.m. on November 1, 1998, at the MetroHealth Medical\n        Center on 2500 MetroHealth Drive. We are concerned for the health, safety and\n        welfare of our students in light of the behavior that we have observed since the\n        District terminated your administrative employment contract on October 2, 1998. In\n        particular, the District has observed you loitering around the administration building\n        during late evening hours. We have also observed you peering into office windows\n        during your visits.\n\nThe letter requested his acceptance by November 4, 1998. The letter was postmarked November 2,\n\n1998; Zafirau did not receive it until November 6, 1998.\n\n\n                                                    6\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\n       The other eight employees whose at-will contracts were terminated but who still held\n\ncontinuing teacher’s contracts were offered classroom teaching positions, and none were conditioned\n\non the successful completion of fitness for duty examinations. Zafirau, through his attorney,\n\nnegotiated the details of the psychological exam but never actually completed it. Correspondence\n\nconcerning the medical examination ended in February 1999, around the same time that Zafirau’s\n\nattorney stopped representing him due to Zafirau’s inability to pay fees.\n\n       Zafirau never completed the examination, and the School District never placed Zafirau in a\n\nteaching position. Nevertheless, the School District asserts that it did not terminate Zafirau’s\n\nemployment. From October 1998 until January 1999, Zafirau was not paid. The CTU filed a\n\nseparate grievance on behalf of a group of teachers laid off for a period during the restructuring\n\nconcerning non-payment during that period. Zafirau was included in this class action even though\n\nhis teaching position was somewhat unique. The CTU reached a settlement on behalf of Zafirau and\n\nothers on September 20, 1999. The “Stipulated Award” was entered by an arbitrator and provided\n\nthat, within 45 days of that date, all grievants would be “placed on and receive compensation per the\n\nTeacher’s Salary Schedule based on years of completed Cleveland Municipal School district service\n\n(administrative and teaching) and/or continuing contract status.” Thereafter, Zafirau received a\n\ncheck on October 29, 1999, for his total net unpaid compensation from October 2, 1998 to December\n\n31, 1998.\n\n       Zafirau received bi-weekly checks from the School District beginning in January 1999 and\n\ncontinuing until October 29, 1999. He received an additional payment in November 1999 for an\n\nadjustment in salary corresponding to his previous payments. He received a final “supplemental\n\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\npay” check on December 24, 1999. Zafirau has not been paid since, nor has he received any\n\nnotification as to why the payments stopped. In November 1999, Zafirau contacted the School\n\nDistrict’s payroll department about his missing checks. He was informed that the checks had been\n\nconfiscated by Ruda. He has not received a W-2 form from the School District since 1998. The\n\nSchool District asserts that he has not been terminated; rather his pay has been suspended until his\n\npsychological examination is completed. Zafirau contends that he never received notification of\n\nsuch action, nor has he been notified again about a psychological examination. Zafirau alleges that,\n\nafter his compensation ended, he “went to the CTU to inquire and complain about the fact and was\n\ntold, basically, that they would not file any more grievances for [him].” Zafirau has subsequently\n\nobtained work in the Toledo Public Schools as a guidance counselor.\n\n        Zafirau filed an original complaint against the School District in the Court of Common Pleas\n\nof Cuyahoga County on October 2, 2000. The case was subsequently dismissed without prejudice\n\nbecause a settlement had been reached. However, Zafirau filed a motion for relief asserting that a\n\nsettlement had not been reached in November 2002. Zafirau then dismissed his own motion and\n\nrefiled the case anew on December 20, 2002. The School District opted to remove the case to the\n\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In Zafirau’s amended complaint\n\nbefore the district court, he asserted the following claims against the School District: (1) that it\n\nviolated his due process rights by denying him his constitutionally protected property interest in his\n\nclassified position and his continuing contract with the District; (2) that it discriminated against him\n\non the basis of his age (including a claim against Carter specifically), in violation of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (ADEA); (3) that it discriminated against him based upon his\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nhearing handicap; (4) that it unlawfully retaliated against him for asserting disability claims; and (5)\n\nthat the District “breached the continuing contract by failing to put [him] in a teaching position after\n\nhe was discharged on October 2, 1998 from the classified position.” Additionally, Zafirau asserted\n\na state-law invasion of privacy claim against Ruda individually.\n\n        On May 2, 2003, the School District, along with Ruda and Carter, moved to dismiss the\n\namended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 12(b)(6). The district court\n\ngranted in part the motion, dismissing the due process and invasion of privacy claims on December\n\n10, 2003. On May 6, 2004, the School District filed a motion for summary judgment as to all\n\nremaining claims. The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge, who prepared a report\n\non August 27, 2004, recommending that the district court grant the School District summary\n\njudgment as to the discrimination claims but deny the motion as to the breach of contract claim and\n\nretain jurisdiction over the matter. Each party filed objections, and, on March 31, 2005, the district\n\ncourt granted the School District’s summary judgment motion as to the retaliation claim, disability\n\nclaim, and dismissed the breach of contract claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because\n\nZafirau failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The district court denied the motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to the age discrimination claim based upon the School District’s failure to\n\nprovide a proper witness for examination. However, upon further review and subsequent discovery,\n\nthe district court granted the School District’s motion for summary judgment as to the age\n\ndiscrimination claim on October 28, 2009. Zafirau timely appealed to this court, arguing that the\n\ndistrict court erred in dismissing his breach of contract claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS.

Here, the district court raised the issue while considering the School District’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment. While the district court had supplemental jurisdiction to consider the breach\n\nof contract claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, it abstained from reaching the merits of the claim\n\nbecause Zafirau failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing this suit.\n\n         When a public employee and an employer have entered into a collective bargaining\n\nagreement and a dispute arises, Ohio Revised Code § 4117 controls.

An appellant may only seek\n\nrelief from the courts after he or she has exhausted the administrative remedy provided through\n\nSERB. Shamrock, 593 N.E.2d at 31.\n\n       Here, Zafirau agreed in his continuing teaching contract to representation by the CTU.\n\nAdditionally, he submitted himself to the representation of the CTU when he agreed to the Stipulated\n\nAward bargained for by the CTU on behalf of aggrieved teachers laid off during the transition period\n\nfrom state to municipal authority in 1998, despite his unique employment situation. Accordingly,\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement (“Agreement”) between the School District and the CTU\n\ncontrols Zafirau’s claim.\n\n        The Agreement, effective from September 1, 1996 through August 31, 1999 (during which\n\nperiod Zafirau alleges injury due to his being terminated in October 1998 in violation of his\n\ncontinuing teacher’s contract), defines a grievance as “any matter concerning the interpretation,\n\napplication, or alleged violation of any currently effective Agreement between the District and the\n\nCTU, or which alleges any employee represented by the Union has been discharged or disciplined\n\nwithout just cause, or has been treated unfairly or in a discriminatory manner.” The Agreement\n\nfurther states that “[n]othing shall preclude the Union or an individual from the right to file an Unfair\n\nLabor Practice in accordance with Ohio Revised Code 4117.”\n\n        All of Zafirau’s alleged injuries on appeal arise in relation to his rights guaranteed by his\n\ncontract and are dependent upon the Agreement he entered upon accepting the position with the\n\nSchool District. The Agreement guaranteed him employment. Accordingly, Zafirau alleges that the\n\nSchool District’s requirement that he subject himself to a psychological examination before working\n\nviolates this Agreement.\n\n        On appeal to this court, Zafirau does not dispute that he has not exhausted his contractual\n\nremedies in failing to file a grievance with SERB. Rather, he argues that any attempt to file a\n\ngrievance with the CTU and follow the grievance procedure would be futile, as both the CTU and\n\nthe Commissioners already expressed disinterest or even hostility towards his previous attempts to\n\nbring a grievance forward. However, the issue of futility does not pertain to Zafirau’s relief through\n\nSERB. He has not sought relief from the union’s alleged unfair labor practice, nor has he even\n\n                                                   12\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\npursued a grievance concerning the School District’s requirement that he submit to a psychological\n\nexamination in order to work as a teacher pursuant to his Stipulated Award. This court cannot\n\nspeculate on the result of such proper complaints. Accordingly, futility cannot avoid the requirement\n\nthat Zafirau must first exhaust his contractual remedies before seeking relief in court. See Fasone\n\nv. Clinton Twp., No. 97APE06-845, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">710584</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (Ohio Ct. App. 1997) (“[E]ven if\n\nappellant’s efforts during the grievance procedure were arguably in vain, the proper course of action\n\nwas still to file a charge with SERB. Hence, the failure-to-exhaust rule and its accompanying\n\nexception do not even apply here.”); Shamrock, 593 N.E.2d at 31 (“[I]f appellants believe that the\n\ngrievance was wrongfully withdrawn and the Commissioners wrongfully refused to arbitrate, then\n\nappellants must pursue the alleged unfair labor practices through SERB pursuant to R.C. Chapter\n\n4117, prior to appealing to this court.”).\n\n        Zafirau attempts to avoid the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies by reframing the\n\nissue on appeal as whether the district court has jurisdiction to enforce the arbitration award\n\nnegotiated by the CTU on his behalf, in that the Stipulated Award indicated that he would be\n\nemployed within forty-five days and did not explicitly require a psychological examination as a\n\nprerequisite to his employment. This argument is not only waived because Zafirau failed to raise it\n\nbelow, but is unpersuasive. See Armstrong v. City of Melvindale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792731\"><a href=\"/opinion/792731/carl-robert-armstrong-donna-m-bradley-renae-armstrong-lori-armstrong/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">695</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 700 (6th Cir. 2006)\n\n(“It is well-settled that this court’s function is to review the case presented to the district court, rather\n\nthan a better case fashioned after an unfavorable order.” (internal punctuation and citation omitted)).\n\nThe Stipulated Award guaranteed that Zafirau would be employed by the School District. The\n\nSchool District did attempt to employ Zafirau in the appropriate time frame subject to the additional\n\n                                                     13\n\fNo. 09-4492\nS. James Zafirau v. Cleveland Municipal School District, et al.\n\nrequirement that he complete the psychological examination. The terms of Zafirau’s employment\n\nwere guaranteed by the Agreement. That the School District required the psychological examination,\n\nhowever, arguably amounted to an unfair labor practice on the part of the School District against\n\nZafirau by interfering with his ability to teach. See Ohio Rev. Code § 4117.11(A)(1) (“It is an unfair\n\nlabor practice for a public employer, its agents, or representatives to: (1) interfere with, restrain, or\n\ncoerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed under Chapter 4117.”). Such a practice\n\nshould be grieved by Zafirau to, or through, the CTU or directly to SERB prior to filing suit in court.\n\nAccordingly, as Zafirau’s claim stemmed from a grievance originating from his rights guaranteed\n\nby the Agreement, any attempt to consider this as a matter of arbitration enforcement disguises the\n\nunderlying issue.\n\n        Finally, because we do not reach the merits of Zafirau’s breach of contract claim, we need\n\nnot address the issue of whether Zafirau appealed from his continuing teacher’s contract alone, or\n\nif he additionally appealed from breach of his classified status as well. We have previously held that\n\n“if a court does not have jurisdiction, ipso facto, it cannot address the merits of a case.” Charter\n\nTwp. of Muskegon v. City of Muskegon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779127\"><a href=\"/opinion/779127/charter-township-of-muskegon-v-city-of-muskegon/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">755</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting Rogers v.\n\nStratton Indus.
