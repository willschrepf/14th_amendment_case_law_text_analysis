HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n\n     The Texas Legislature restricted the distribution of federal\n\nfamily planning funds.          Finding this state legislation likely\n\npreempted by federal spending statutes, the district court granted\n\na preliminary injunction against its enforcement.          The district\n\ncourt concluded that the state legislation could not be interpreted\n\nto permit various Planned Parenthood organizations to continue\n\n\n                                      1\n\freceiving federal funds by creating independent affiliates.                   We\n\ndisagree.      Persuaded that the state legislation does admit of this\n\npotentially saving construction, we remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                       I\n\n      The State of Texas voluntarily participates in several federal\n\nprograms that provide funds for family planning services.                 Among\n\nthese programs are Title X of the Public Health Service Act,1 which\n\nprovides project grants to public and private agencies for family\n\nplanning services, and Title XX of the Social Security Act,2 which\n\nprovides block grants to the states for social services, including\n\nfamily planning.        The regulations for Title X specify that funds\n\nmay not be used to finance abortions or abortion-related activity.3\n\nBoth parties agree that any Title XX funds used to match Title X\n\nfunds are subject to the same restrictions.            Furthermore, Title XX\n\nfunds may not be used for the provision of medical care.4                    The\n\nState also receives Medicaid funding under Title XIX of the Social\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          42 U.S.C. § 300 et seq.\n      2\n          42 U.S.C. § 1397 et seq.\n      3\n        Title X provides that “[n]one of the funds appropriated under this\nsubchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family\nplanning.” 42 U.S.C. § 300a-6.\n      4\n        42 U.S.C. § 1397d(a)(4) (“[G]rants made under this subchapter may not be\nused by the State, or by any other person with which the State makes arrangements\nto carry out the purposes of this subchapter . . . for the provision of medical\ncare (other than family planning services, rehabilitation services, or initial\ndetoxification of an alcoholic or drug dependent individual) unless it is an\nintegral but subordinate part of a social service for which grants may be used\nunder this subchapter.”).\n\n                                       2\n\fSecurity Act,5 which provides medical care to the needy through a\n\ncooperative federal-state program.\n\n      The Texas Department of Health (TDH)6 distributes federal\n\nfamily program grants under Titles X and XX.            On May 8, 2003, TDH\n\nsent letters to the family planning contractors that had been\n\napproved to receive funding under TDH’s federal family planning\n\nprogram      grants.7     Appellees--six    Planned    Parenthood     entities\n\nlocated in various parts of Texas that had been contractors in\n\nTexas’s family planning program for many years--were among the\n\ngroups approved for funding.           Pursuant to Title X’s statutory\n\nrequirements, Appellees strictly segregated their Title X programs\n\nfrom their abortion-related activities to ensure that no federal\n\nfunds were used for abortions.8         Thus, Appellees provided Title X\n\nand XX family planning services using the federal funds disbursed\n\nby TDH, and provided abortion services using private funding.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record to suggest that Title X or XX\n\nfunds were ever improperly commingled with private abortion funds.\n\n\n\n      5\n          42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.\n      6\n        TDH became part of the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS)\non September 1, 2004. See Act of June 10, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., Tex. H.B. 2292.\nEduardo J. Sanchez, previously the Texas Commissioner of Health, is now the\nCommissioner of the TDSHS.      For simplicity we will continue refer to the\ndefendant as TDH.\n      7\n        The letters stated that the “funding award is subject to change as a\nresult of legislation and/or changes in appropriations.”\n      8\n       One of the Appellees, Planned Parenthood of the Texas Capital Region, had\nnot yet begun providing abortions but intended to “break ground” on the\nconstruction of an abortion clinic in September 2003.\n\n                                       3\n\f      Just under one month later, on June 2, 2003, the Texas\n\nLegislature passed the Texas General Appropriations Act.9               The Act\n\nincluded Rider 8, a provision restricting distribution of federal\n\nfamily planning money, including Title X and XX funds.10                Rider 8\n\nprovides:\n\n           8.    Prohibition on Abortions\n                a. It is the intent of the Legislature that no\n                funds shall be used to pay the direct or\n                indirect costs (including overhead, rent,\n                phones and utilities) of abortion procedures\n                provided by contractors of the department.\n                b. It is also the intent of the legislature\n                that no funds appropriated under Strategy\n                D.1.2, Family Planning, shall be distributed\n                to individuals or entities that perform\n                elective abortion procedures or that contract\n                with or provide funds to individuals or\n                entities for the performance of elective\n                abortion procedures.\n                c. If the department concludes that compliance\n                with b. would result in a significant\n                reduction in family planning services in any\n                public health region of the state, the\n                department may waive b. for the affected\n                region to the extent necessary to avoid a\n                significant reduction in family planning\n                services to the region. This waiver provision\n                shall expire on August 31, 2004, and no waiver\n                shall extend beyond that date.\n                d. The department shall include in its\n                financial audit a review of the use of\n                appropriated funds to ensure compliance with\n                this section.\n\n\n      9\n        78th Leg., R.S., Tex. H.B. 1. The Governor signed the Act on June 22,\n2003 and it became effective on September 1, 2003.\n      10\n         Rider 8 applies to all TDH contractors receiving funds under Strategy\nD.1.2, which includes federal funds granted to TDH pursuant to Title X, Title XIX\nand Title XX. The parties focus primarily on Rider 8’s effect on Title X funds.\n\n                                       4\n\f      TDH immediately began efforts to implement Rider 8.                On June\n\n10, 2003, TDH sent letters to previously approved family planning\n\ncontractors, including Appellees, requiring them to sign and return\n\nan affidavit by June 30, 2003.               The affidavit was a pledge by a\n\ncontractor applying for Title X and XX funds that, as of September\n\n1, 2003, it would perform no elective abortion procedures and that\n\nit would not contract with or provide funds to individuals or\n\nentities for the performance of abortions. Appellees were informed\n\nthat unless they made this pledge they would be ineligible for\n\nparticipation in the funding programs.\n\n      Appellees filed suit on June 26, 2003, seeking immediate\n\ninjunctive relief. Appellees focused on section (b) of Rider 8 and\n\nraised three basic arguments: (1) that Rider 8(b) imposes an\n\nunconstitutional condition on Appellees’ eligibility for funds; (2)\n\nthat it imposes an unconstitutional burden on a woman’s right to\n\nobtain an abortion; and (3) that it violates the Supremacy Clause11\n\nby   imposing      additional    eligibility     requirements    on    Appellees’\n\nreceipt of federal funds that are inconsistent with the federal\n\nfunding statutes.\n\n      The district court issued a temporary restraining order on\n\nJune 30, 2003.         A few days later, on August 4, 2003, the court\n\nentered      a   preliminary     injunction     barring   TDH   from   enforcing\n\n\n\n\n      11\n           U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2.\n\n                                         5\n\fparagraphs (b) and (c) of the Rider.12               The court determined that\n\nAppellees      had    demonstrated     a       likelihood   of   success    on   the\n\nunconstitutional condition claim and the Supremacy Clause claim.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion the court held that Rider 8 could not\n\nbe interpreted to allow Appellees effectively to continue receiving\n\nfederal funds by creating independent “affiliates”--that is, legal\n\nentities separate from those performing abortions.\n\n      TDH appeals the court’s holding as to the unconstitutional\n\ncondition and Supremacy Clause claims, and asserts that Rider 8 can\n\nbe interpreted to allow affiliates.                Appellees, in turn, contend\n\nthat the district court erred in concluding that Rider 8 imposes no\n\nundue burden on women’s right to obtain an abortion.\n\n                                           II\n\n      We     review   the   ultimate   decision       to    grant   a   preliminary\n\ninjunction for an abuse of discretion.13                A decision grounded in\n\nerroneous legal principles is reviewed de novo.14\n\n      To obtain a preliminary injunction plaintiffs must show (1) a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial\n\nthreat that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if the\n\n      12\n        Planned Parenthood of Cent. Tex. v. Sanchez, 280 F. Supp. 2d 590 (W.D.\nTex. 2003).\n\n      13\n         See Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 931-32 (1975) (“[W]hile the\nstandard to be applied by the district court in deciding whether a plaintiff is\nentitled to a preliminary injunction is stringent, the standard of appellate\nreview is simply whether the issuance of the injunction . . . constituted an\nabuse of discretion.”); Karaha Bodas Co., L.L.C. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan\nMinyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 335 F.3d 357, 363 (5th Cir. 2003).\n      14\n           See Karaha Bodas Co., 335 F.3d at 363.\n\n                                           6\n\finjunction is not granted, (3) that the threatened injury outweighs\n\nany damage that the injunction might cause the defendant, and (4)\n\nthat the injunction will not disserve the public interest.15                    A\n\npreliminary injunction is an “extraordinary remedy” and should only\n\nbe granted if the plaintiffs have “‘clearly carried the burden of\n\npersuasion’ on all four requirements.”16\n\n                                        III\n\n      We turn to the Supremacy Clause claim.            Appellees assert that\n\nRider 8 is invalid under the Supremacy Clause because it adds\n\neligibility requirements to the receipt of federal funds that are\n\ninconsistent       with   federal     law.     The   district   court   found   a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits.             In our review, we\n\nfirst explain why this is a preemption claim.                   Then we examine\n\nwhether      the   district   court    had    jurisdiction   and   whether   the\n\nAppellees stated a claim, as well as the role of 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nin this case.\n\n                                         A\n\n      Where, as here, a state law purportedly conflicts with federal\n\nstatutes enacted under the Spending Clause,17 courts often proceed\n\n\n\n\n      15\n           Id.\n      16\n         Id. (quoting Miss. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipe Line Co., 760\nF.2d 618, 621 (5th Cir. 1985)).\n      17\n        U.S. CONST. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1 (“The Congress shall have Power To lay and\ncollect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the\ncommon Defence and general Welfare of the United States . . . .”).\n\n                                         7\n\fwithout invoking “preemption.”18        Some courts have explicitly found\n\nthat preemption was not an issue in such cases,19 while others have\n\nexpressed ambivalence.20        The growing consensus, however, is to\n\nanalyze such claims under traditional preemption doctrine.21                 The\n\nFirst Circuit gave the following explanation:\n\n\n      18\n         See, e.g., Townsend v. Swank, 404 U.S. 282 (1971) (holding state law\ninvalid by virtue of conflict with federal Spending Clause legislation but\nwithout reference to “preemption”); King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309 (1968) (same).\n      19\n        See, e.g., Jane Does 1 Through 4 v. State of Utah Dep’t of Health, 776\nF.2d 253, 256 (10th Cir. 1985) (finding state parental consent conditions\nviolated Title X, but noting that “[w]e do not see a preemption issue in this\ncase”).\n\n      20\n        See, e.g., N.Y. State Dep’t of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 411\nn.9 (1973) (noting that “pre-emption” is used “in a rather special sense” because\nthe litigation addresses whether a state has gone too far in placing conditions\non the receipt of federal funds, rather than the “arguable federal pre-emption\nof a wholly independent state program dealing with the same or a similar\nproblem”).\n      Another court expressed the following:\n\n            It would not seem to be of any consequence whether this\n            is described as “preemption” in the sense used in the\n            traditional doctrine, or as an application of the\n            Supremacy Clause to the administration of state-federal\n            programs derived from the voluntary nature of state\n            participation in the programs. The latter is a more\n            realistic treatment . . . .\n\n                  . . . .\n\n                  . . . If the [state chooses] to participate, there\n            is thereby accepted a limitation or restriction on state\n            statutes or regulations which conflict with the federal\n            statutes.     This has consequences similar to the\n            traditional preemption doctrine but as mentioned they\n            come about by a choice made by the state.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Dandoy, 810 F.2d 984, 988 (10th Cir. 1987)\n(citation omitted).\n      21\n         See, e.g., Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v.

Lead-Deadwood Sch. Dist. No. 40-1, 469 U.S. 256,\n259 n.6, 260 (1985).\n\n                                       8\n\f                    The vast majority of preemption cases\n              involve situations in which Congress has\n              exercised its power under the Commerce Clause.\n              Here,    however,   we   are   dealing   with   a\n              congressional exercise of the spending power,\n              not the commerce power, and the dynamics\n              between preemption and Congress’s reliance on\n              the spending power differ appreciably from\n              those applicable in the Commerce Clause\n              context. The principal difference is that\n              whereas preemptive legislation enacted under\n              the    Commerce    Clause   trumps   state    law\n              throughout the United States ex proprio\n              vigore, preemptive legislation enacted under\n              the spending power presents states with a\n              choice: they may either accept federal funds\n              (and    subject   themselves   to   requirements\n              imposed by federal law) or decline such funds\n              (and avoid the necessity of abiding by those\n              requirements).22\n\n      Because TDH has “willingly tapped into the federal fisc,”23 we\n\nuse the terminology and framework of preemption in analyzing\n\nAppellees’ Supremacy Clause claim, as did the district court\n\nbelow.24\n\n                                           B\n\n      We next ask whether the district court properly exercised\n\njurisdiction       over    Appellees’          preemption    claim     and    whether\n\nAppellees’ efforts state a claim.

Delta Airlines, the\n\nSupreme Court held:\n\n              A plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from\n              state regulation, on the ground that such\n              regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute\n              which, by virtue of the Supremacy Clause of\n              the Constitution, must prevail, thus presents\n              a federal question which the federal courts\n              have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 to\n              resolve.26\n\nWe recently affirmed this principle, holding that when a plaintiff\n\nseeks “injunctive relief based on a federal statute, federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction clearly exists based on Shaw.”27              Several of\n\nour sister circuits have explicitly agreed.28\n\n                                        2\n\n\n\n      25\n        See, e.g., Verizon Md., Inc. v.

We disagree.\n\n      Cognizant of the distinction between the inquiry into federal\n\ncourt jurisdiction and whether a claim has been stated, we remind\n\nthat “[i]t is firmly established [by Supreme Court precedent] that\n\nthe absence of a valid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action\n\ndoes not implicate subject-matter jurisdiction, i.e., the courts’\n\nstatutory      or   constitutional       power      to      adjudicate      the   case.”29\n\nRecently,      however,      a      majority     of      the      Supreme     Court      in\n\nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America v. Walsh\n\nimplicitly rejected the contention that asserting the preemptive\n\nforce of federal Spending Clause legislation is itself no claim.30\n\nIn that case, the plaintiff alleged that a state regulation was\n\npreempted by Medicaid, a federal Spending Clause statute.

In this type of action, it is the\n\ninterests protected by the Supremacy Clause, not by the preempting\n\nstatute, that are at issue.”31                 A plurality of four Justices,\n\napparently accepting these conclusions, reached the merits of the\n\nplaintiff’s claim,32 as did the three dissenting Justices.33 In sum,\n\nseven      Justices     assumed    both      that    the    federal    courts     have\n\njurisdiction and that a claim was stated for Spending Clause\n\npreemption,       tacitly    rejecting       the    suggestion   advanced    by   two\n\nconcurring Justices--and today espoused by TDH--that no claim was\n\nstated.34\n\n      Following        Walsh,   the   D.C.

These arguments have great purchase, and they might also apply\nin the Title X context, see, e.g., 42 C.F.R. § 59.7(b); 42 C.F.R. § 59.10; 42\nC.F.R. § 50.404(a)(1); however, their persuasive force is wasted on the inferior\ncourts. Rather, they must persuade at least three other Justices.\n\n                                          12\n\fplaintiffs “have no private right of action for injunctive relief\n\nagainst the state” based on the preemptive effect of a federal\n\nSpending         Clause   statute.35    The   court      explained   that   “[b]y\n\naddressing the merits of the parties’ arguments without mention of\n\nany jurisdictional flaw . . . seven Justices [in Walsh] appear to\n\nhave sub silentio found no flaw.”36\n\n      Outside the Spending Clause context, the Supreme Court has\n\nrepeatedly entertained federal preemption claims seeking injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief.37          Shaw itself indicates that the federal\n\ncourts have jurisdiction “to resolve” such claims.38                 In Verizon\n\nMaryland, Inc. v. Public Service Commission of Maryland, the Court\n\nrecently reinforced this understanding in holding that there was\n\njurisdiction to resolve Verizon’s claim that a state utility\n\ncommission’s order was inconsistent with federal law.39                The Court\n\nnoted:\n\n                 Whether the text of [the federal statute] can\n                 be so construed [to provide for federal court\n                 review] is a question we need not decide.

In Gillis v. Louisiana, after examining the plaintiff’s\n\npetition for injunctive relief based on federal preemption and\n\nconcluding that we had jurisdiction to consider it, we addressed\n\nthe merits without pausing to examine the footing of the claim.42\n\nSimilarly, in Hope Medical Group for Women v.

Verizon did not sue to enforce its contractual rights, and none\nof its claims was based on its alleged contractual rights.         As the Court\nexplained:\n\n                 Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission\n                 violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered\n                 payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.\n                 Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the\n                 Commission’s order was unlawful, and an injunction\n                 prohibiting its enforcement.    We have no doubt that\n                 federal courts have jurisdiction under § 1331 to\n                 entertain such a suit.\n\nId.\n      42\n           294 F.3d 759-60 (suit removed to federal court from state court).\n\n                                           14\n\fclaim had been stated.43          Finally, in Self-Insurance Institute of\n\nAmerica v. Korioth, we confronted a claim that a Texas statutory\n\nprovision was preempted by ERISA, noting that “[t]he question of\n\npreemption is particularly one for the federal courts and arises as\n\nmuch    from       the   Constitution     as    from    ERISA.”44    In   exercising\n\njurisdiction and upholding the plaintiff’s standing, we held that\n\nthe non-profit organization had proffered “allegations of actual\n\ninjury that are likely to be remedied with favorable court action”\n\nand remanded the case for an “inquiry into the merits.”45                        While\n\nGillis, Hope Medical and Korioth do not directly address the issue\n\nof whether a valid cause of action existed, we assumed that one\n\ndid.        Today we hold that one does.\n\n       Other circuits have similarly recognized an implied cause of\n\naction        to    bring    preemption        claims   seeking     injunctive    and\n\ndeclaratory relief even absent an explicit statutory claim.46                     One\n\n       43\n            63 F.3d at 423-38.\n       44\n            993 F.2d 479, 484 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n       45\n            Id. at 484-85.\n\n      46\n         See Local Union No. 12004, 377 F.3d at 74-75 (“A plaintiff may assert\nfederal preemption as an affirmative cause of action to enjoin state officials\nfrom interfering with federal rights. . . .

SHAPIRO, HART & WECHSLER’S THE\nFEDERAL COURTS & THE FEDERAL SYSTEM 903 (5th ed. 2003).\n       While the Supreme Court has not explained the source of this right of\naction, one school of thought holds that the Supremacy Clause itself creates an\nimplied cause of action. Professors Wright, Miller and Cooper argue that “[t]he\nbest explanation of Ex Parte Young and its progeny is that the Supremacy Clause\ncreates an implied right of action for injunctive relief against state officers\nwho are threatening to violate the federal Constitution or laws.” 13B CHARLES A.\nWRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER, & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE: JURISDICTION 2D\n§ 3566, at 102 (1984).         Some courts share this view.          See, e.g., Burgio &\nCampofelice v. N.Y. State Dep’t of Labor, 107 F.3d 1000, 1006 (2d Cir. 1997)\n(“[T]he Supremacy Clause creates an implied right of action for injunctive relief\nagainst state officers who are threatening to violate [federal law].”); see also\nBellSouth Telecomms., Inc. v.

It only gives\npriority to federal rights created by a federal statute when they conflict with\nstate law.”), aff’d, 707 F.2d 23 (1st Cir. 1983).\n       Another possible source is the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.\n§§ 2201-2202, upon which courts have occasionally explicitly relied. See, e.g.,\nFirst Nat’l Bank of E. Ark., 907 F.2d at 776 (affirming lower court’s declaration\nthat state’s action was preempted by the National Bank Act where “[j]urisdiction\nwas invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 2201”); Doe v. Pickett, 480 F.\nSupp. 1218, 1223 (S.D. W. Va. 1979) (entering judgment pursuant to §§ 2201-2202\nthat state cannot impose parental consent requirement on use of Title X funds).\nWhile the Declaratory Judgment Act “is not an independent ground for jurisdiction\n[and] permits the award of declaratory relief only when other bases for\n\n                                             16\n\f      We have little difficulty in holding that Appellees have an\n\nimplied right of action to assert a preemption claim seeking\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n                                         C\n\n      TDH further argues that plaintiffs must meet the requirements\n\nfor an action under § 1983,48 as recently enunciated in Gonzaga\n\nUniversity v. Doe.49        We are not persuaded.\n\n      As an initial matter, TDH mischaracterizes the nature of\n\nAppellees’ claim.        Appellees are not asking the courts to enforce\n\ntheir “right” under § 1983 to secure enforcement of Title X, as TDH\n\nasserts.         Rather,    Appellees’        Supremacy   Clause   argument   is\n\nfundamentally different: they argue that Rider 8 imposes conditions\n\non the receipt of federal funds that are incompatible with Title X.\n\nTherefore, we need not be concerned that the Supremacy Clause does\n\nnot of its own force create rights enforceable under § 1983.50\n\n      Next, we note that Gonzaga, by its terms, applies only to\n\n\n\njurisdiction are present,” Jones v.

Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671\n(1950)), it might well provide a cause of action where, as here, jurisdiction is\nwell-established. While the district court was correct in noting that the DJA\ndid not supply jurisdiction, it did not address the potential for the DJA to\nsupply a right of action. See Sanchez, 280 F.

With respect to the plaintiff’s claim for damages,\n\nthe Supreme Court held that “unless Congress ‘speak[s] with a clear\n\nvoice,’ and manifests an ‘unambiguous’ intent to confer individual\n\nrights, federal funding provisions provide no basis for private\n\nenforcement by § 1983.”51        The Supremacy Clause claim advanced here\n\nby Appellees is not based on a claim of right under Title X, nor is\n\nit a claim for damages; it is a preemption claim.                 The Gonzaga\n\nCourt gave no indication that it intended to alter its prior\n\npractice regarding such claims, as we have explained.52\n\n      In sum, we affirm the district court’s finding of jurisdiction\n\nand we hold that Appellees have an implied right of action to seek\n\ninjunctive relief from a state statute purportedly preempted by\n\nfederal Spending Clause legislation.          Such a claim for relief does\n\nnot require a showing, as per Gonzaga, that a § 1983 action would\n\nalso be proper.

The Court found no room either in the Act’s\n            language or legislative history to warrant the States’\n            additional eligibility requirements. Here, by contrast,\n            the Act allows for complementary state work incentive\n            programs and procedures incident thereto--even if they\n            become conditions for continued assistance.

According to\n\nTDH, Rider 8 can be read to allow Appellees to continue to receive\n\nfunds     by    creating   separate    affiliates--e.g.   by    dividing     into\n\n“Family Planning” entities and “Abortion Services” entities.                 The\n\ndistrict court concluded that “[s]uch a suggestion is absurd in\n\nlight of the stated purpose of Rider 8--to eradicate the supposed\n\nimprimatur of state funding of abortion that currently exists--\n\nwhich would be undermined if recipients could avoid Rider 8 simply\n\nby creating affiliates and making no substantive changes.”63\n\n     However, nothing in the plain language of Rider 8 precludes\n\nthe creation of affiliates.           The district court’s observation that\n\n“under Rider 8, funding recipients cannot provide any funds to or\n\ncontract with an abortion provider” does not answer the question.64\n\nRider     8     only   prohibits   contracting   for   the     performance    of\n\nabortions.        It does not prohibit all contracting with an entity\n\nthat performs abortions.           As such, Rider 8 does not preclude a\n\nfamily planning services provider from maintaining a contract with\n\nTDH while simultaneously creating a separate legal entity that\n\nperforms abortions and receives no federal funds.\n\n     In Planned Parenthood of Mid-Missouri & Eastern Kansas, Inc.\n\nv. Dempsey, the Eighth Circuit examined a Missouri state statute,\n\n\n     63\n          Sanchez, 280 F. Supp. 2d at 611.\n     64\n          Id.\n\n                                         22\n\fsimilar to Rider 8, that prohibited organizations or affiliates of\n\norganizations that provided or promoted abortions from receiving\n\nstate family-planning funds.65            The court ultimately concluded that\n\nthe state         law   was    not   unconstitutional,     but   it    reached   this\n\ndecision only by interpreting the regulation to allow grantees to\n\ncreate independent affiliates that could perform abortions.66                    The\n\ncourt came to this conclusion despite language in the Missouri\n\nstatute that, unlike Rider 8, seemed to foreclose the formation of\n\naffiliates.67\n\n      We have less difficulty concluding that Rider 8 admits of an\n\ninterpretation          that    allows    service    providers        to   affiliate.\n\nAppellees’ argument that Rider 8 must be read to prevent all\n\ncontracting with entities that perform abortions is without merit.\n\nAccordingly, the district court’s conclusion that Rider 8 prohibits\n\naffiliation is in error.\n\n\n      65\n         167 F.3d 458 (8th Cir. 1999).     The state statute at issue there\nrestricted the Missouri Department of Health’s expenditure of state funds:\n\n                 [N]one of these funds may be expended for the purpose of\n                 performing, assisting or encouraging for abortion, and\n                 further provided that none of these funds may be\n                 expended to directly or indirectly subsidize abortion\n                 services or administrative expenses, as verified by\n                 independent audit. None of these funds may be paid or\n                 granted to organizations or affiliates of organizations\n                 which provide or promote abortions.

That is because, as we will explain, we are\n\npersuaded that, absent the possibility of affiliates, Rider 8 would\n\nlikely be preempted.              Under an interpretation that forecloses\n\naffiliates, Rider 8 denies participation by entities--abortion\n\nproviders--that are deemed eligible by Title X and the associated\n\nregulations.68         Rider      8’s   eligibility   standard,      by   excluding\n\nentities eligible under Title X, would violate that statute and\n\ntherefore be invalid under the Supremacy Clause.69\n\n       Appellees      point    to   three    provisions   in   the    statute   and\n\nregulations which evince a congressional intent to allow abortion\n\nproviders to obtain funding.                 First, § 300a-6 specifies that\n\n“[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be\n\nused in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.”70\n\nThis    provision,      Appellees       contend,   illustrates    that     Congress\n\nintended only to limit the use of funding, not the identity of\n\nrecipients.        Had Congress wished to bar abortion providers from\n\nreceiving funding, it presumably could have included its own Rider\n\n\n\n       68\n         Although Appellees also support their Supremacy Clause claim by\nreference to Title XIX and Title XX, as the instant disposition will not change,\nwe express no opinion beyond Title X.\n       69\n            See Townsend, 404 U.S. at 286.\n       70\n            42 U.S.C. § 300a-6.\n\n                                            24\n\f8-style provision in Title X instead of a provision like § 300a-6.71\n\n       Second, Appellees point to a provision in the Department of\n\nHealth       and    Human    Services   (DHHS)     regulations    that   explicitly\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n                  § 59.3 Who is eligible to apply for a family\n                  planning services grant?\n\n                  Any public or nonprofit private entity in a\n                  State may apply for a grant under this\n                  subpart.72\n\n\nAs Appellees stress, by its terms, this provision allows any\n\napplicant to apply for funds, even applicants who perform abortions\n\nwith private funds or in separate facilities.\n\n       Finally, Appellees point to regulations adopted by DHHS on\n\nJuly        3,    2000,     entitled    the    “Standards   of    Compliance    for\n\nAbortion-Related Services in Family Planning Services Projects.”73\n\nThese standards “revise the regulations that apply to grantees\n\nunder       the    federal    family    planning    program”     and   “establish[]\n\nrequirements for recipients of family planning services grants\n\nunder [Title X].”74           Overall, “[t]he effect of the revisions . . .\n\nis to revoke the compliance standards, promulgated in 1988 and\n\npopularly known as the ‘Gag Rule,’ that restricted family planning\n\n\n\n       71\n            Such a provision might, of course, be unconstitutional on other grounds.\n       72\n            42 C.F.R. § 59.3.\n       73\n            See 65 Fed.

The\n\nSecretary’s comments are clearly premised on the notion that\n\nabortion providers will receive funding.                     Indeed, one of the\n\nSecretary’s        explicit   concerns      is   that   hospitals     that      provide\n\nabortions not be put to needless expense by having to create\n\n\n\n\n     75\n          Id.\n     76\n          500 U.S. 173 (1991).\n     77\n          65 Fed.

The Court held,\n\nfirst, that DHHS may require physical and financial separation of\n\nabortion activities and family planning services without violating\n\nthe plain language of Title X.81 The Court explained, however, that\n\nTitle X draws a distinction between Title X projects and Title X\n\ngrantees:\n\n                 The Secretary’s regulations do not force the\n                 Title X grantee to give up abortion-related\n                 speech; they merely require that the grantee\n                 keep such activities separate and distinct\n                 from Title X activities.   Title X expressly\n                 distinguishes between a Title X grantee and a\n                 Title X project. The grantee, which normally\n                 is a health-care organization, may receive\n                 funds from a variety of sources for a variety\n                 of purposes.

The regulations govern the scope\n             of the Title X project’s activities, and leave\n             the   grantee    unfettered   in   its   other\n             activities. The Title X grantee can continue\n             to perform abortions, provide abortion-related\n             services, and engage in abortion advocacy; it\n             simply is required to conduct those activities\n             through programs that are separate and\n             independent from the project that receives\n             Title X funds.82\n\nThe Supreme Court examined Title X and, even with the restrictive\n\nGag Rule then in place, expressly stated that grant recipients\n\ncould continue to provide abortion services outside the scope of\n\nthe Title X project.        The Court concluded:\n\n                  By requiring that the Title X grantee\n             engage in abortion-related activity separately\n             from activity receiving federal funding,\n             Congress has . . . not denied it the right to\n             engage    in   abortion-related    activities.\n             Congress has merely refused to fund such\n             activities out of the public fisc, and the\n             Secretary has simply required a certain degree\n             of separation from the Title X project in\n             order to ensure the integrity of the federally\n             funded program.83\n\nUnder Title X, then, abortion providers are eligible to receive\n\nfamily planning funding; Title X requires only that they use that\n\nfunding for legitimate Title X purposes.\n\n     TDH provides little to dispute Appellees’ argument.              Its\n\nprincipal argument focuses on Title X’s prohibition on the use of\n\nTitle X funds to pay for abortions.          As the argument goes, Rider 8\n\n\n     82\n          Id. at 196 (citations omitted) (last emphasis added).\n     83\n          Id. at 198.\n\n                                       28\n\ffurthers    this    end    by    ensuring      that     federal        funds    are      used\n\ncorrectly.         TDH    also   points     to    Rust’s        vindication         of    the\n\ngovernment’s power to impose regulations requiring physical and\n\nfinancial separation of family planning and abortion facilities.\n\nTDH insists that Rider 8 falls within Rust’s safe-harbor.\n\n      TDH’s argument is not persuasive.                 While it is no doubt true\n\nthat an affiliate-prohibiting Rider 8 would help ensure that funds\n\nare not misappropriated, it nonetheless would disqualify entities\n\nthat Title X regards as eligible for funding without any showing\n\nthat the entity has misused funds.                Rust, moreover, provides no\n\nsupport for Appellees because, while Rust approved of regulations\n\nrequiring physical and financial separation and limiting doctors’\n\nreference to abortion, those regulations were promulgated by the\n\nfederal    government.84         Here,    Texas       is    attempting         to    impose\n\nregulations that restrict the scope of a federal program.                                 And\n\nRider 8--still       assuming     arguendo       that      it   does    not    allow      for\n\naffiliates--would do far more than require physical separation; it\n\nwould require that entities not engage in abortion activities even\n\nwith private funds and in separate facilities.                         In the end, TDH\n\n\n\n      84\n         See Rust, 500 U.S. at 178-81; see also Regan v. Taxation with\nRepresentation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540 (1997) (Congress, exercising spending\npower, can refuse to fund lobbying activities where organizations are free to\nestablish a separate affiliate to engage in lobbying without the use of federal\nfunds); Planned Parenthood Fed’n of Am. v. Heckler, 712 F.2d 650, 663 (D.C. Cir.\n1983) (“Although Congress is free to permit the states to establish eligibility\nrequirements for recipients of Title X funds, Congress has not delegated that\npower to the states. Title X does not provide, or suggest, that states are\npermitted to determine eligibility criteria for participants in Title X\nprograms.” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).\n                                          29\n\fprovides nothing to counter Appellees’ argument that Title X--both\n\nby   its    express    terms   and    as   interpreted   by   the   DHHS--allows\n\nabortion providers to receive funding.\n\n      To be entitled to a preliminary injunction, Appellees must\n\nshow a substantial likelihood that they will succeed on their\n\nclaim.      On an affiliate-precluding interpretation of Rider 8, the\n\ndistrict court would not abuse its discretion in so concluding,\n\ngiven that Rider 8’s eligibility requirements would seriously\n\nundermine and obstruct Congress’s intent in distributing funds\n\nunder Title X.\n\n                                           3\n\n      As just described, without affiliates, Rider 8 is likely\n\ndoomed to preemption, so we ask if there is an alternative.                    We\n\nturn to that inquiry, mindful that we “will not rewrite a . . . law\n\nto conform it to constitutional requirements.”85               For example, in\n\na case involving an abortion statute, the Nebraska Attorney General\n\noffered a “saving” interpretation not supported by the statute’s\n\ntext or legislative history, and the Supreme Court rejected the\n\ninvitation, explaining that “we are without power to adopt a\n\nnarrowing       construction     of    a    state   statute    unless   such   a\n\nconstruction is reasonable and readily apparent.”86 Where, as here,\n\nlanguage in a statute is ambiguous and “an otherwise acceptable\n\n\n\n      85\n        Reno v.

Our own reading of Rider 8 leads us to the conclusion that\n\naffiliates are permitted.\n\n      In Dempsey, the court similarly sought to interpret a state\n\nstatute so as to avoid running afoul of federal law.89                 In that\n\ncase, the statute at issue regulated only state funds and, thus,\n\ndid not address federal preemption issues but rather focused only\n\non   unconstitutional         conditions.       Nonetheless,     the   court’s\n\nwillingness to interpret the statute to allow for affiliates in\n\norder to avoid constitutional problems is instructive.90 Similarly,\n\nwe must choose the interpretation of Rider 8 that has a chance of\n\n\n\n      87\n        Edward J.

Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 213 (1988)\n(“Deference to what appears to be nothing more than an agency’s convenient\nlitigating position would be entirely inappropriate.”).\n      89\n           167 F.3d at 461-64.\n\n      90\n         The Dempsey opinion is a stretch.     The Missouri statute explicitly\nstated that “[n]one of these funds may be paid or granted to organizations or\naffiliates of organizations which provide or promote abortions.” 89th Leg., 2d\nSess., Mo. H.B. 1010, § 10.715(1) (emphasis added), quoted in Dempsey, 167 F.3d\nat 463. The court stated that “nothing [in this statute] expressly prohibits\ngrantees from maintaining an affiliation with an abortion service provider, so\nlong as the affiliated abortion service provider does not directly or indirectly\nreceive State family-planning funds.” Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 463. Perhaps the\ncourt concluded that the statute barred affiliates but not “independent”\naffiliates, but even this is less than persuasive.\n                                        31\n\favoiding federal preemption.\n\n                                     4\n\n      At this point, under the affiliate-permissible interpretation\n\nof Rider 8, there are two possibilities: either the affiliate\n\nrequirement is a relatively empty formalism or it is a more\n\nsubstantial obstacle.      The former is permissible, while the latter\n\nlikely is not.\n\n      Given the district court’s view that Rider 8 did not permit\n\naffiliation, the vitality of the alternative was not developed.\n\nFrom the limited record, we cannot say whether there is nonetheless\n\na substantial likelihood that Rider 8 would in practical terms work\n\nthe same mischief in this case as it would if it disallowed\n\naffiliation entirely.      Recall that Appellees had been approved as\n\ncontractors to receive federal funds when Rider 8 was enacted.\n\nAssuming that affiliation is prospectively an option for providers\n\nin general, it is not clear on this record whether Appellees had\n\nthat opportunity.     TDH evidenced its intent to enforce Rider 8 as\n\nto these providers when it sent them letters in early June, giving\n\nAppellees roughly twenty days to return an affidavit swearing that\n\nthey would not provide abortions or contract for their provision.\n\nGiven that TDH made no mention at that time of the possibility of\n\naffiliation, it is not clear that Appellees could have avoided\n\nforfeiting their contracts by affiliating, nor is it clear that\n\nthere was sufficient time to do so even had they been so inclined.\n\nWe   note   that   Rider   8’s   effect   on   these   previously-approved\n\n                                     32\n\fproviders might prove to be different from the impact of a purely\n\nprospective application of Rider 8 on new contract determinations.\n\n      On remand, unless Appellees can show that the burden of\n\nforming affiliates in forthcoming years would in practical terms\n\nfrustrate their ability to receive federal funds, Rider 8 should be\n\nupheld and the injunction dissolved.              While creating affiliates\n\nmight entail some time and expense, and might not be the most\n\nconvenient arrangement, this extra effort alone would not relegate\n\nthe state statute to preemption.91\n\n      Given the disposition in this case, we need not address the\n\ndistrict court’s treatment of the remaining requirements for a\n\npreliminary injunction: threat of injury to the Appellees, to TDH,\n\nand to the public interest.\n\n                                       V\n\n      The case is REMANDED and the district court is directed to\n\nproceed with a trial on the merits.          The injunction granted below\n\nmust be dissolved unless the Appellees carry their burden of\n\ndemonstrating that insisting on the use of affiliates would so\n\nhinder   their    operations     as   to   work    in   practical   terms    an\n\nimpermissible prohibition by the State of Texas upon the ability of\n\nthese Appellees to continue their abortion services using their own\n\n\n      91\n         Cf.

HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:\n\n     The Texas Legislature restricted the distribution of federal\n\nfamily planning funds.          Finding this state legislation likely\n\npreempted by federal spending statutes, the district court granted\n\na preliminary injunction against its enforcement.          The district\n\ncourt concluded that the state legislation could not be interpreted\n\nto permit various Planned Parenthood organizations to continue\n\n\n                                      1\n\freceiving federal funds by creating independent affiliates.                   We\n\ndisagree.      Persuaded that the state legislation does admit of this\n\npotentially saving construction, we remand for further proceedings.\n\n                                       I\n\n      The State of Texas voluntarily participates in several federal\n\nprograms that provide funds for family planning services.                 Among\n\nthese programs are Title X of the Public Health Service Act,1 which\n\nprovides project grants to public and private agencies for family\n\nplanning services, and Title XX of the Social Security Act,2 which\n\nprovides block grants to the states for social services, including\n\nfamily planning.        The regulations for Title X specify that funds\n\nmay not be used to finance abortions or abortion-related activity.3\n\nBoth parties agree that any Title XX funds used to match Title X\n\nfunds are subject to the same restrictions.            Furthermore, Title XX\n\nfunds may not be used for the provision of medical care.4                    The\n\nState also receives Medicaid funding under Title XIX of the Social\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          42 U.S.C. § 300 et seq.\n      2\n          42 U.S.C. § 1397 et seq.\n      3\n        Title X provides that “[n]one of the funds appropriated under this\nsubchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family\nplanning.” 42 U.S.C. § 300a-6.\n      4\n        42 U.S.C. § 1397d(a)(4) (“[G]rants made under this subchapter may not be\nused by the State, or by any other person with which the State makes arrangements\nto carry out the purposes of this subchapter . . . for the provision of medical\ncare (other than family planning services, rehabilitation services, or initial\ndetoxification of an alcoholic or drug dependent individual) unless it is an\nintegral but subordinate part of a social service for which grants may be used\nunder this subchapter.”).\n\n                                       2\n\fSecurity Act,5 which provides medical care to the needy through a\n\ncooperative federal-state program.\n\n      The Texas Department of Health (TDH)6 distributes federal\n\nfamily program grants under Titles X and XX.            On May 8, 2003, TDH\n\nsent letters to the family planning contractors that had been\n\napproved to receive funding under TDH’s federal family planning\n\nprogram      grants.7     Appellees--six    Planned    Parenthood     entities\n\nlocated in various parts of Texas that had been contractors in\n\nTexas’s family planning program for many years--were among the\n\ngroups approved for funding.           Pursuant to Title X’s statutory\n\nrequirements, Appellees strictly segregated their Title X programs\n\nfrom their abortion-related activities to ensure that no federal\n\nfunds were used for abortions.8         Thus, Appellees provided Title X\n\nand XX family planning services using the federal funds disbursed\n\nby TDH, and provided abortion services using private funding.\n\nThere is no evidence in the record to suggest that Title X or XX\n\nfunds were ever improperly commingled with private abortion funds.\n\n\n\n      5\n          42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.\n      6\n        TDH became part of the Texas Department of State Health Services (TDSHS)\non September 1, 2004. See Act of June 10, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., Tex. H.B. 2292.\nEduardo J. Sanchez, previously the Texas Commissioner of Health, is now the\nCommissioner of the TDSHS.      For simplicity we will continue refer to the\ndefendant as TDH.\n      7\n        The letters stated that the “funding award is subject to change as a\nresult of legislation and/or changes in appropriations.”\n      8\n       One of the Appellees, Planned Parenthood of the Texas Capital Region, had\nnot yet begun providing abortions but intended to “break ground” on the\nconstruction of an abortion clinic in September 2003.\n\n                                       3\n\f      Just under one month later, on June 2, 2003, the Texas\n\nLegislature passed the Texas General Appropriations Act.9               The Act\n\nincluded Rider 8, a provision restricting distribution of federal\n\nfamily planning money, including Title X and XX funds.10                Rider 8\n\nprovides:\n\n           8.    Prohibition on Abortions\n                a. It is the intent of the Legislature that no\n                funds shall be used to pay the direct or\n                indirect costs (including overhead, rent,\n                phones and utilities) of abortion procedures\n                provided by contractors of the department.\n                b. It is also the intent of the legislature\n                that no funds appropriated under Strategy\n                D.1.2, Family Planning, shall be distributed\n                to individuals or entities that perform\n                elective abortion procedures or that contract\n                with or provide funds to individuals or\n                entities for the performance of elective\n                abortion procedures.\n                c. If the department concludes that compliance\n                with b. would result in a significant\n                reduction in family planning services in any\n                public health region of the state, the\n                department may waive b. for the affected\n                region to the extent necessary to avoid a\n                significant reduction in family planning\n                services to the region. This waiver provision\n                shall expire on August 31, 2004, and no waiver\n                shall extend beyond that date.\n                d. The department shall include in its\n                financial audit a review of the use of\n                appropriated funds to ensure compliance with\n                this section.\n\n\n      9\n        78th Leg., R.S., Tex.

The Governor signed the Act on June 22,\n2003 and it became effective on September 1, 2003.\n      10\n         Rider 8 applies to all TDH contractors receiving funds under Strategy\nD.1.2, which includes federal funds granted to TDH pursuant to Title X, Title XIX\nand Title XX. The parties focus primarily on Rider 8’s effect on Title X funds.\n\n                                       4\n\f      TDH immediately began efforts to implement Rider 8.                On June\n\n10, 2003, TDH sent letters to previously approved family planning\n\ncontractors, including Appellees, requiring them to sign and return\n\nan affidavit by June 30, 2003.               The affidavit was a pledge by a\n\ncontractor applying for Title X and XX funds that, as of September\n\n1, 2003, it would perform no elective abortion procedures and that\n\nit would not contract with or provide funds to individuals or\n\nentities for the performance of abortions. Appellees were informed\n\nthat unless they made this pledge they would be ineligible for\n\nparticipation in the funding programs.\n\n      Appellees filed suit on June 26, 2003, seeking immediate\n\ninjunctive relief. Appellees focused on section (b) of Rider 8 and\n\nraised three basic arguments: (1) that Rider 8(b) imposes an\n\nunconstitutional condition on Appellees’ eligibility for funds; (2)\n\nthat it imposes an unconstitutional burden on a woman’s right to\n\nobtain an abortion; and (3) that it violates the Supremacy Clause11\n\nby   imposing      additional    eligibility     requirements    on    Appellees’\n\nreceipt of federal funds that are inconsistent with the federal\n\nfunding statutes.\n\n      The district court issued a temporary restraining order on\n\nJune 30, 2003.         A few days later, on August 4, 2003, the court\n\nentered      a   preliminary     injunction     barring   TDH   from   enforcing\n\n\n\n\n      11\n           U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2.\n\n                                         5\n\fparagraphs (b) and (c) of the Rider.12               The court determined that\n\nAppellees      had    demonstrated     a       likelihood   of   success    on   the\n\nunconstitutional condition claim and the Supremacy Clause claim.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion the court held that Rider 8 could not\n\nbe interpreted to allow Appellees effectively to continue receiving\n\nfederal funds by creating independent “affiliates”--that is, legal\n\nentities separate from those performing abortions.\n\n      TDH appeals the court’s holding as to the unconstitutional\n\ncondition and Supremacy Clause claims, and asserts that Rider 8 can\n\nbe interpreted to allow affiliates.                Appellees, in turn, contend\n\nthat the district court erred in concluding that Rider 8 imposes no\n\nundue burden on women’s right to obtain an abortion.\n\n                                           II\n\n      We     review   the   ultimate   decision       to    grant   a   preliminary\n\ninjunction for an abuse of discretion.13                A decision grounded in\n\nerroneous legal principles is reviewed de novo.14\n\n      To obtain a preliminary injunction plaintiffs must show (1) a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a substantial\n\nthreat that plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury if the\n\n      12\n        Planned Parenthood of Cent.

In Gillis v. Louisiana, after examining the plaintiff’s\n\npetition for injunctive relief based on federal preemption and\n\nconcluding that we had jurisdiction to consider it, we addressed\n\nthe merits without pausing to examine the footing of the claim.42\n\nSimilarly, in Hope Medical Group for Women v.

Verizon did not sue to enforce its contractual rights, and none\nof its claims was based on its alleged contractual rights.         As the Court\nexplained:\n\n                 Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission\n                 violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered\n                 payment of reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls.\n                 Verizon sought a declaratory judgment that the\n                 Commission’s order was unlawful, and an injunction\n                 prohibiting its enforcement.    We have no doubt that\n                 federal courts have jurisdiction under § 1331 to\n                 entertain such a suit.\n\nId.\n      42\n           294 F.3d 759-60 (suit removed to federal court from state court).\n\n                                           14\n\fclaim had been stated.43          Finally, in Self-Insurance Institute of\n\nAmerica v. Korioth, we confronted a claim that a Texas statutory\n\nprovision was preempted by ERISA, noting that “[t]he question of\n\npreemption is particularly one for the federal courts and arises as\n\nmuch    from       the   Constitution     as    from    ERISA.”44    In   exercising\n\njurisdiction and upholding the plaintiff’s standing, we held that\n\nthe non-profit organization had proffered “allegations of actual\n\ninjury that are likely to be remedied with favorable court action”\n\nand remanded the case for an “inquiry into the merits.”45                        While\n\nGillis, Hope Medical and Korioth do not directly address the issue\n\nof whether a valid cause of action existed, we assumed that one\n\ndid.        Today we hold that one does.\n\n       Other circuits have similarly recognized an implied cause of\n\naction        to    bring    preemption        claims   seeking     injunctive    and\n\ndeclaratory relief even absent an explicit statutory claim.46                     One\n\n       43\n            63 F.3d at 423-38.\n       44\n            </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606696\"><a href=\"/opinion/606696/17-employee-benefits-cas-1751-pens-plan-guide-p-23880g-self-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (5th Cir. 1993).\n\n       45\n            Id. at 484-85.\n\n      46\n         See Local Union No. 12004, 377 F.3d at 74-75 (“A plaintiff may assert\nfederal preemption as an affirmative cause of action to enjoin state officials\nfrom interfering with federal rights. . . .

According to\n\nTDH, Rider 8 can be read to allow Appellees to continue to receive\n\nfunds     by    creating   separate    affiliates--e.g.   by    dividing     into\n\n“Family Planning” entities and “Abortion Services” entities.                 The\n\ndistrict court concluded that “[s]uch a suggestion is absurd in\n\nlight of the stated purpose of Rider 8--to eradicate the supposed\n\nimprimatur of state funding of abortion that currently exists--\n\nwhich would be undermined if recipients could avoid Rider 8 simply\n\nby creating affiliates and making no substantive changes.”63\n\n     However, nothing in the plain language of Rider 8 precludes\n\nthe creation of affiliates.           The district court’s observation that\n\n“under Rider 8, funding recipients cannot provide any funds to or\n\ncontract with an abortion provider” does not answer the question.64\n\nRider     8     only   prohibits   contracting   for   the     performance    of\n\nabortions.        It does not prohibit all contracting with an entity\n\nthat performs abortions.           As such, Rider 8 does not preclude a\n\nfamily planning services provider from maintaining a contract with\n\nTDH while simultaneously creating a separate legal entity that\n\nperforms abortions and receives no federal funds.\n\n     In Planned Parenthood of Mid-Missouri & Eastern Kansas, Inc.\n\nv. Dempsey, the Eighth Circuit examined a Missouri state statute,\n\n\n     63\n          Sanchez, 280 F.

That is because, as we will explain, we are\n\npersuaded that, absent the possibility of affiliates, Rider 8 would\n\nlikely be preempted.              Under an interpretation that forecloses\n\naffiliates, Rider 8 denies participation by entities--abortion\n\nproviders--that are deemed eligible by Title X and the associated\n\nregulations.68         Rider      8’s   eligibility   standard,      by   excluding\n\nentities eligible under Title X, would violate that statute and\n\ntherefore be invalid under the Supremacy Clause.69\n\n       Appellees      point    to   three    provisions   in   the    statute   and\n\nregulations which evince a congressional intent to allow abortion\n\nproviders to obtain funding.                 First, § 300a-6 specifies that\n\n“[n]one of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be\n\nused in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.”70\n\nThis    provision,      Appellees       contend,   illustrates    that     Congress\n\nintended only to limit the use of funding, not the identity of\n\nrecipients.        Had Congress wished to bar abortion providers from\n\nreceiving funding, it presumably could have included its own Rider\n\n\n\n       68\n         Although Appellees also support their Supremacy Clause claim by\nreference to Title XIX and Title XX, as the instant disposition will not change,\nwe express no opinion beyond Title X.\n       69\n            See Townsend, 404 U.S. at 286.\n       70\n            42 U.S.C. § 300a-6.\n\n                                            24\n\f8-style provision in Title X instead of a provision like § 300a-6.71\n\n       Second, Appellees point to a provision in the Department of\n\nHealth       and    Human    Services   (DHHS)     regulations    that   explicitly\n\nprovides as follows:\n\n                  § 59.3 Who is eligible to apply for a family\n                  planning services grant?\n\n                  Any public or nonprofit private entity in a\n                  State may apply for a grant under this\n                  subpart.72\n\n\nAs Appellees stress, by its terms, this provision allows any\n\napplicant to apply for funds, even applicants who perform abortions\n\nwith private funds or in separate facilities.\n\n       Finally, Appellees point to regulations adopted by DHHS on\n\nJuly        3,    2000,     entitled    the    “Standards   of    Compliance    for\n\nAbortion-Related Services in Family Planning Services Projects.”73\n\nThese standards “revise the regulations that apply to grantees\n\nunder       the    federal    family    planning    program”     and   “establish[]\n\nrequirements for recipients of family planning services grants\n\nunder [Title X].”74           Overall, “[t]he effect of the revisions . . .\n\nis to revoke the compliance standards, promulgated in 1988 and\n\npopularly known as the ‘Gag Rule,’ that restricted family planning\n\n\n\n       71\n            Such a provision might, of course, be unconstitutional on other grounds.\n       72\n            42 C.F.R. § 59.3.\n       73\n            See 65 Fed.

The Court held,\n\nfirst, that DHHS may require physical and financial separation of\n\nabortion activities and family planning services without violating\n\nthe plain language of Title X.81 The Court explained, however, that\n\nTitle X draws a distinction between Title X projects and Title X\n\ngrantees:\n\n                 The Secretary’s regulations do not force the\n                 Title X grantee to give up abortion-related\n                 speech; they merely require that the grantee\n                 keep such activities separate and distinct\n                 from Title X activities.   Title X expressly\n                 distinguishes between a Title X grantee and a\n                 Title X project.

The Title X grantee can continue\n             to perform abortions, provide abortion-related\n             services, and engage in abortion advocacy; it\n             simply is required to conduct those activities\n             through programs that are separate and\n             independent from the project that receives\n             Title X funds.82\n\nThe Supreme Court examined Title X and, even with the restrictive\n\nGag Rule then in place, expressly stated that grant recipients\n\ncould continue to provide abortion services outside the scope of\n\nthe Title X project.        The Court concluded:\n\n                  By requiring that the Title X grantee\n             engage in abortion-related activity separately\n             from activity receiving federal funding,\n             Congress has . . . not denied it the right to\n             engage    in   abortion-related    activities.\n             Congress has merely refused to fund such\n             activities out of the public fisc, and the\n             Secretary has simply required a certain degree\n             of separation from the Title X project in\n             order to ensure the integrity of the federally\n             funded program.83\n\nUnder Title X, then, abortion providers are eligible to receive\n\nfamily planning funding; Title X requires only that they use that\n\nfunding for legitimate Title X purposes.\n\n     TDH provides little to dispute Appellees’ argument.              Its\n\nprincipal argument focuses on Title X’s prohibition on the use of\n\nTitle X funds to pay for abortions.          As the argument goes, Rider 8\n\n\n     82\n          Id. at 196 (citations omitted) (last emphasis added).\n     83\n          Id. at 198.\n\n                                       28\n\ffurthers    this    end    by    ensuring      that     federal        funds    are      used\n\ncorrectly.         TDH    also   points     to    Rust’s        vindication         of    the\n\ngovernment’s power to impose regulations requiring physical and\n\nfinancial separation of family planning and abortion facilities.\n\nTDH insists that Rider 8 falls within Rust’s safe-harbor.\n\n      TDH’s argument is not persuasive.                 While it is no doubt true\n\nthat an affiliate-prohibiting Rider 8 would help ensure that funds\n\nare not misappropriated, it nonetheless would disqualify entities\n\nthat Title X regards as eligible for funding without any showing\n\nthat the entity has misused funds.                Rust, moreover, provides no\n\nsupport for Appellees because, while Rust approved of regulations\n\nrequiring physical and financial separation and limiting doctors’\n\nreference to abortion, those regulations were promulgated by the\n\nfederal    government.84         Here,    Texas       is    attempting         to    impose\n\nregulations that restrict the scope of a federal program.                                 And\n\nRider 8--still       assuming     arguendo       that      it   does    not    allow      for\n\naffiliates--would do far more than require physical separation; it\n\nwould require that entities not engage in abortion activities even\n\nwith private funds and in separate facilities.

Our own reading of Rider 8 leads us to the conclusion that\n\naffiliates are permitted.\n\n      In Dempsey, the court similarly sought to interpret a state\n\nstatute so as to avoid running afoul of federal law.89                 In that\n\ncase, the statute at issue regulated only state funds and, thus,\n\ndid not address federal preemption issues but rather focused only\n\non   unconstitutional         conditions.

The Missouri statute explicitly\nstated that “[n]one of these funds may be paid or granted to organizations or\naffiliates of organizations which provide or promote abortions.” 89th Leg., 2d\nSess., Mo. H.B. 1010, § 10.715(1) (emphasis added), quoted in Dempsey, 167 F.3d\nat 463. The court stated that “nothing [in this statute] expressly prohibits\ngrantees from maintaining an affiliation with an abortion service provider, so\nlong as the affiliated abortion service provider does not directly or indirectly\nreceive State family-planning funds.” Dempsey, 167 F.3d at 463. Perhaps the\ncourt concluded that the statute barred affiliates but not “independent”\naffiliates, but even this is less than persuasive.\n                                        31\n\favoiding federal preemption.\n\n                                     4\n\n      At this point, under the affiliate-permissible interpretation\n\nof Rider 8, there are two possibilities: either the affiliate\n\nrequirement is a relatively empty formalism or it is a more\n\nsubstantial obstacle.      The former is permissible, while the latter\n\nlikely is not.\n\n      Given the district court’s view that Rider 8 did not permit\n\naffiliation, the vitality of the alternative was not developed.\n\nFrom the limited record, we cannot say whether there is nonetheless\n\na substantial likelihood that Rider 8 would in practical terms work\n\nthe same mischief in this case as it would if it disallowed\n\naffiliation entirely.      Recall that Appellees had been approved as\n\ncontractors to receive federal funds when Rider 8 was enacted.\n\nAssuming that affiliation is prospectively an option for providers\n\nin general, it is not clear on this record whether Appellees had\n\nthat opportunity.     TDH evidenced its intent to enforce Rider 8 as\n\nto these providers when it sent them letters in early June, giving\n\nAppellees roughly twenty days to return an affidavit swearing that\n\nthey would not provide abortions or contract for their provision.\n\nGiven that TDH made no mention at that time of the possibility of\n\naffiliation, it is not clear that Appellees could have avoided\n\nforfeiting their contracts by affiliating, nor is it clear that\n\nthere was sufficient time to do so even had they been so inclined.\n\nWe   note   that   Rider   8’s   effect   on   these   previously-approved\n\n                                     32\n\fproviders might prove to be different from the impact of a purely\n\nprospective application of Rider 8 on new contract determinations.\n\n      On remand, unless Appellees can show that the burden of\n\nforming affiliates in forthcoming years would in practical terms\n\nfrustrate their ability to receive federal funds, Rider 8 should be\n\nupheld and the injunction dissolved.              While creating affiliates\n\nmight entail some time and expense, and might not be the most\n\nconvenient arrangement, this extra effort alone would not relegate\n\nthe state statute to preemption.91\n\n      Given the disposition in this case, we need not address the\n\ndistrict court’s treatment of the remaining requirements for a\n\npreliminary injunction: threat of injury to the Appellees, to TDH,\n\nand to the public interest.\n\n                                       V\n\n      The case is REMANDED and the district court is directed to\n\nproceed with a trial on the merits.          The injunction granted below\n\nmust be dissolved unless the Appellees carry their burden of\n\ndemonstrating that insisting on the use of affiliates would so\n\nhinder   their    operations     as   to   work    in   practical   terms    an\n\nimpermissible prohibition by the State of Texas upon the ability of\n\nthese Appellees to continue their abortion services using their own\n\n\n      91\n         Cf.
