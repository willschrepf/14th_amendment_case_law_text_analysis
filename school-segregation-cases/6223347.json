(NL), and the Sherwin-Williams Company\n         1\n(SWC). The trial court ordered ConAgra, NL, and SWC to pay $1.15 billion into a fund to\nbe used to abate the public nuisance created by interior residential lead paint in the 10\n\n\n\n1\n       Plaintiff’s action was brought on behalf of the residents of Santa Clara County, San\nFrancisco City and County, Alameda County, Los Angeles County, Monterey County, City\nof Oakland, City of San Diego, San Mateo County, Solano County, and Ventura County. In\nthis opinion, we will refer to these two cities, seven counties, and one city and county as the\n10 jurisdictions.\n\fCalifornia jurisdictions represented by plaintiff. ConAgra, NL, and SWC (collectively\ndefendants) challenge the court’s judgment on many grounds. They contend, among other\nthings, that the court’s judgment is not supported by substantial evidence of knowledge,\npromotion, causation, or abatability. Defendants also challenge the judgment on separation\nof powers and due process grounds, claim that they were erroneously denied a jury trial, and\n                                                                                     2\nassert that the trial court made other prejudicial procedural and evidentiary errors. We\nconclude that the trial court’s judgment must be reversed because substantial evidence does\nnot support causation as to residences built after 1950.

We reject\nthe remainder of defendants’ contentions.\n\n\n                               I. Plaintiff’s Evidence at Trial\n       “[L]ead is a toxin and causes irreversible brain damage.” Childhood lead poisoning\nis “the number one environmental health problem for children” in California. “Childhood\nlead poisoning at the level at which it is occurring is definitely an epidemic in California.”\n“The most common source of lead exposure to children in California is lead-based paint and\n                                                                            3\nhow it contributes to soil and dust contamination in and around housing.” Experts have\nreached a consensus “that lead-based paint is a predominant source of childhood lead\n                                  4\nexposure [in] pre-1978 housing.” Children in pre-1946 housing are subject to “three times\n\n\n\n\n2\n       This is but a partial list of their contentions. SWC and ConAgra also each assert an\nindividual contention.\n3\n       “Lead-based paint” is not the only source of childhood lead exposure. Children in\nthe 10 jurisdictions have also been exposed to lead from occupational sources (such as lead\ndust brought home by construction workers), leaded gasoline, imported goods (such as\npottery, Mexican candy, and toys), home remedies (such as “Greta” and “Azarcon”),\ncosmetics, jewelry, spices, and chapulines (grasshoppers).\n4\n       “ ‘Lead-based paint’ means paint or other surface coatings that contain an amount of\nlead equal to, or in excess of: [¶] (a) one milligram per square centimeter (1.0 mg/cm2); or\n                                               2\n\fthe percentage of elevations in blood lead level” as those in post-1978 housing. Lead in\nhomes accounts for at least 70 percent of all childhood lead poisonings. Lead paint is a\nmajor contributor to blood lead levels because the lead content of paint is high, while most\nother lead sources have only trace amounts. And the most common type of lead paint\ncontains white lead carbonate, which is highly absorbable. Between 1929 and 1974, more\nthan 75 percent of the white lead carbonate produced in this country was used in lead paint.\nThrough the 1940s, lead paint contained as much as 50 percent lead.\n       “Children are exceptionally vulnerable” to lead because “they explore their\nenvironment with typical hand-to-mouth contact behavior.” Lead paint chips “taste sweet,”\nwhich may explain why children ingest them. Young children are at especially high risk\nfrom residential lead paint because they spend the vast majority of their time in their homes.\nInfants and young children also absorb much more lead than older children and adults.\nBecause children are smaller, lead intake has a proportionally larger impact on their bodies,\nand children absorb lead more easily. Children are also more vulnerable to the toxic effects\nof lead because their biological systems are still developing.\n       The “brain effects [of lead exposure] in children are irreversible,” so the “only option\nis to prevent the exposure in the first place.” There is “no safe exposure level” for lead\n“[b]ecause no measurable level of lead in blood is known to be without deleterious effects,\nand because once engendered the effects appear to be irreversible.” Blood lead levels less\n                                          5\nthan 5 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) can cause children to suffer impaired intellect\n                          6\nand behavioral problems. “[E]ven among children with the lowest levels of lead\nexposure,” studies suggest that “there is ongoing harm down to the lowest measurable\n\n\n\n[¶] (b) half of one percent (0.5%) by weight.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35033.) This is\nwhat we mean when we use “lead paint” in this opinion.\n5\n       A microgram (mcg) is a millionth of a gram. A deciliter (dL) is a tenth of a liter.\n6\n        Bone lead levels are a better indicator than blood lead levels of the impact of lead on\nintellectual abilities. Blood lead levels may underestimate the impact of lead exposure.\n                                               3\n\flevels.” “[B]lood lead levels below 5 micrograms per deciliter are associated with\ndecreased academic achievement, diminished IQ scores, or intellectual abilities, cognitive\nabilities, attention-related behavior problems and antisocial behaviors . . . .” Lead exposure\nas a child continues to impact the body when the child becomes an adult. It “has\nreproductive effects, it has impacts on things like birth weight, and even fertility, delays\nfertility,” and it can be associated with cardiovascular disease.\n       Even intact lead paint poses a potential risk of future lead poisoning to children\nbecause lead paint surfaces will inevitably deteriorate. “[A]ll paint eventually deteriorates.\nOn certain surfaces it deteriorates more rapidly than others[;] mainly those surfaces are\nhigh-use surfaces, such as windows and doors.” Paint deteriorates when it is exposed to\nultraviolet light, water, fungus (such as mildew), friction, or abrasion. More than one-third\n                                                                       7\nof pre-1978 homes nationwide with intact lead paint have lead dust. In contrast, only 6\npercent of homes without lead paint have lead dust. Lead in soil adjacent to homes\ngenerally comes from lead paint, not leaded gas emissions, because post-1978 housing has\n                8\nno soil lead.\n       Most of the housing in the 10 jurisdictions was built before 1980, with the\n                                                                                               9\npercentages ranging from 51 to 83 percent and is therefore presumed to contain lead paint.\n\n\n\n7\n       “ ‘Lead-contaminated dust’ means dust that contains an amount of lead equal to, or in\nexcess of: [¶] (a) forty micrograms per square foot (40mg/ft2) for interior floor surfaces; or\n[¶] (b) two hundred and fifty micrograms per square foot (250mg/ft2) for interior horizontal\nsurfaces; or [¶] (c) four hundred micrograms per square foot (400mg/ft2) for exterior floor\nand exterior horizontal surfaces.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35035.)\n8\n       “ ‘Lead-contaminated soil’ means bare soil that contains an amount of lead equal to,\nor in excess of, four hundred parts per million (400 ppm) in children’s play areas and one\nthousand parts per million (1000 ppm) in all other areas.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17,\n§ 35036.)\n9\n       “ ‘Presumed lead-based paint’ means paint or surface coating affixed to a component\nin or on a structure constructed prior to January 1, 1978.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17,\n§ 35043.)\n                                               4\n\f                                                                               10\nPre-1940 homes are three times as likely to have lead-based paint hazards, with 86 percent\nhaving lead-based paint hazards and 67 percent having “significant” lead-based paint\n                                                   11\nhazards such as“deteriorated lead-based paint.”         “[H]omes with lead-based paint are 10\ntimes more likely than homes without lead-based paint to have dust lead levels on floors and\non window sills above the federal limits.” And “homes with lead-based paint are more\nlikely to have soil lead levels on the exterior of the home above the EPA [(federal\nEnvironmental Protection Agency)] criteria limits.” Even when lead paint is “intact,” soil\nlevels can exceed EPA limits. Lead paint creates soil lead “by the friction and impact\nsurfaces, opening and closing windows and doors on a home with lead-based paint,” from\nthe deterioration of exterior lead paint, and from “sanding and scraping” when repainting.\nWhen there is lead in the soil, it is often tracked into the home, creating household lead\ndust.\n        Since the 19th century, the medical profession has recognized that lead paint is toxic\nand a poison. An 1878 article by an English doctor recognized that the use of lead paint on\nthe interiors of homes could have poisonous effects on the people who lived in the home.\nAn 1895 article by a San Francisco doctor recounted how a child had been poisoned by lead\npaint that she had scratched off her crib. A 1904 article by a doctor in Queensland,\nAustralia described multiple cases of children being poisoned by lead dust from lead paint\non walls and railings of a house. He believed that the lead dust had been ingested by the\nchildren after it got on their fingers and thereby into their mouths. His investigation found\n\n\n\n\n10\n       “ ‘Lead hazard’ means deteriorated lead-based paint, lead contaminated dust, lead\ncontaminated soil, disturbing lead-based paint or presumed lead-based paint without\ncontainment, or any other nuisance which may result in persistent and quantifiable lead\nexposure.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35037.)\n11\n       “ ‘Deteriorated lead-based paint’ means lead-based paint or presumed lead-based\npaint that is cracking, chalking, flaking, chipping, peeling, non-intact, failed, or otherwise\nseparating from a component.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35022.)\n                                               5\n\f                                                                             12\nlead dust on interior walls where the paint was still in “good condition.”        An authoritative\n1907 textbook edited by a noted American doctor, which was widely used in medical\neducation, discussed the 1904 article and observed that children had been poisoned by lead\n                                                                                                 13\npaint on woodwork in their homes that had produced lead dust and gotten onto their hands.\nThese articles “recognized the dust pathway from paint on a wall, to dust on the floor, to the\nhands of children, into their mouth[s], as a way of ingestion.”\n       Many medical articles by doctors in the early 20th century described lead poisoning\nof children from lead paint. A 1917 article by an American doctor discussed the 1904\nAustralian article and also described the cases of multiple children who had gnawed lead\npaint off furniture and died. A 1926 article discussed the case of a child who had died from\nlead poisoning after she “gnawed” lead paint off her bed. A 1933 article pointed out that\n“children get exposed to lead-based paint in the homes by their common tendency to put\nthings in their mouth[s].” It also stated that most cases involved infants and small children\nand that children were more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults. Another 1933 article\nnoted: “It must be obvious that for every child who becomes paralysed by lead there must\nbe literally hundreds who have been affected by the poison in some more or less minor\ndegree.” “[T]he extent of the lead paint menace has been minimized, and in consequence,\nliterally thousands of children have been allowed to run the risks of lead absorption.”\n\n\n\n\n12\n      In 1922, Queensland, Australia banned lead paint from areas to which young children\nhad access.\n13\n        Plaintiff presented an expert who testified that in 1909 public health officials and\ndoctors were suggesting that there be legislation banning lead paint due to the risk of\nexposure for children. This expert cited his own 2005 article in which he asserted that\nresearchers had stated in 1909 that “[p]aint containing lead should never be employed where\nchildren, especially young children, are accustomed to play,” and “[a] number of European\ncountries banned lead-based paint soon thereafter.” He also relied on a seven-page\n“annotated bibliography” that he had prepared, which listed, but did not include, numerous\narticles that he had reviewed.\n                                              6\n\f       Published medical articles in this era recognized that even small amounts of lead\ncould cause children to suffer harm. A 1931 British Medical Journal article discussed the\n“insidious” effects of “infinitesimal doses of lead” over a long period of time. A 1935\nAmerican medical journal article suggested that there were “insidious” “cumulative effects\nof infinitesimal doses of lead” that could be “obscure.” A 1938 British medical article\nstated that “the harmful effects of continued small doses of lead begin from the moment the\nlead is absorbed” and can lead to a long series of “subtle” harms. It opined that “there is no\nthreshold below which still smaller doses can be regarded as being without some adverse\neffect.” A 1943 American medical journal article discussed the impact of early childhood\nsubacute lead poisoning on a child’s intelligence and subsequent academic achievement; it\ncalled for a ban on interior residential use of lead paint.\n       Knowledge about the toxic properties of lead paint was not limited to the medical\nprofession. In May 1910, the United States House of Representatives’ Committee on\nInterstate and Foreign Commerce held a hearing on a bill aimed at preventing lead\npoisoning. The bill would have required products containing white lead to “be labeled\nconspicuously and securely with a skull and crossbones and the words: ‘White lead:\npoison.’ ” The sponsor of the bill noted that France had already “entirely prohibited the use\nof white lead because of its injurious character” and that “all countries of Europe” had\nalready enacted legislation like his proposal. He spoke of “the injurious effect of these\natoms of white lead that are filling the air now; they come loose from doors, from window\nsills, from everywhere, we inhale them and consequently disease is caused which physicians\ndo not understand and can not say what it really is, but it is, in many cases, simply a case of\nlead poisoning.” Another proponent of the bill observed that “the most eminent scientists\nand doctors of Great Britain” had “found that the small particles that result from chalking,\nespecially from internal painting and external painting as well, when taken by inhalation\ninto the lungs, are absorbed and become a poison to the system.” This congressional\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fhearing was attended by an attorney for “practically all of the paint manufacturers of this\ncountry” who stated their opposition to the proposal. The bill failed.\n       A few years later, in 1914, Henry Gardner, who was the assistant director of the\nInstitute of Industrial Research and also the director of the Paint Manufacturers\nAssociation’s Educational Bureau, published a speech that he had given to the International\nAssociation of Master House Painters and Decorators of the United States and Canada at\nthat association’s annual convention in February 1914. In this speech, Gardner\nacknowledged that “the presence of [white lead] dust in the atmosphere of a room is very\ndangerous to the health of the inmates” and that “[l]ead poisoning may occur through\ninhalation of [lead] dust . . . .”\n       Despite this evidence of the toxic properties of white lead, the main use for white\n                                                       14\nlead in the 20th century was as a pigment for paint.        NL, SWC, and ConAgra’s\npredecessor, Fuller, were among the handful of companies that manufactured white lead\ncarbonate pigments during the 20th century, and all three of them used white lead carbonate\npigment to make paint. NL, SWC, and Fuller were all leaders in the lead paint industry, and\nthey knew at that time that lead dust was poisonous. They were also aware that lead paint\n“powders and chalks” “soon after it is applied” and routinely produces lead dust after a\ncouple of years.\n       In 1922, NL, SWC, and Fuller were making white lead carbonate pigment, using it in\ntheir paints, and promoting white lead pigment in paint for use on and in residential homes.\nSales of white lead peaked in 1922. There was a decrease in the use of lead paint in the\n1920s and early 1930s. By 1944, during World War II, the use of lead paint for residential\ninteriors had declined to a low level.\n\n\n\n\n14\n       Plaintiff’s experts defined “lead-based paint” as either paint containing lead pigment\nor paint that was “either considered 100 percent or 70 percent pure white lead . . . or\nalternatively mixed paint with . . . ‘high-lead content.’ ”\n                                              8\n\f       NL manufactured white lead carbonate pigment from 1891 to 1978, and it had\nmanufacturing facilities in San Francisco and Los Angeles that manufactured white lead\ncarbonate pigments in California between 1900 and 1972. It sold those pigments to\nCalifornia paint manufacturers, used them in its own paint products sold in California, and\nadvertised and promoted paint products containing those pigments for residential use within\nthe 10 jurisdictions during that same period. NL “kept up with the medical literature” about\nlead poisoning. NL’s 1912 annual report acknowledged that lead dust was a “danger to the\nhealth” of workers exposed to it in the making of white lead. By the mid to late 1920s, NL\nknew that children who chewed on things painted with lead paint could get lead poisoning\nand die from it. Nevertheless, NL’s lead paints were marketed for residential use and sold\nin and advertised in the 10 jurisdictions between 1900 and 1972. NL produced a handbook\nfor consumers in 1950 that instructed them to use lead paint on the interiors of their homes.\n       ConAgra’s predecessor, Fuller, manufactured white lead carbonate pigment from\n1894 until at least 1958. Fuller manufactured white lead carbonate pigment at its San\nFrancisco factory until 1898, when it moved its factory to South San Francisco. At this\nfactory, Fuller refined white lead carbonate and was a “major producer” of lead paint.\nFuller also had a plant in Los Angeles. Fuller’s lead paints were sold at its own stores and\n                                                                        15\nby independent dealers in all 10 jurisdictions between 1894 and 1961.        Fuller knew that\nlead dust was poisonous. In 1919, an article about Fuller’s South San Francisco plant noted\nthat lead dust is poisonous.\n       SWC began manufacturing paints containing white lead carbonate pigments in 1880.\nSWC’s internal publication, The Chameleon, published an article in 1900 that\nacknowledged the many dangers of lead paint. It stated: “A familiar characteristic of white\nlead is its tendency to crumble from the surface, popularly known as chalking”; “It is also\nfamiliarly known that white lead is a deadly cumulative poison”; and “This noxious quality\n\n\n15\n       Fuller also produced and sold non-lead paints.\n                                              9\n\fbecomes serious in a paint that disintegrates and is blown about by the wind.” In 1910,\nSWC bought a lead mine, which it utilized to manufacture white lead carbonate pigment\nfrom 1910 to 1947 for use in its own paints. SWC stopped manufacturing white lead\n                                                                     16\ncarbonate in 1947, but it continued to make lead paint until 1958.        SWC had plants in\nEmeryville and later in Los Angeles that manufactured paint containing white lead\ncarbonate. SWC continued to sell lead paint until 1972. SWC removed all lead from its\nresidential paints by the end of 1972.\n       Two trade associations, the Lead Industries Association (LIA) and the National\nPaint, Varnish, and Lacquer Association (NPVLA) promoted the use of lead paint. Fuller,\nNL, and SWC were members of both the LIA and the NPVLA. The LIA, which was\ncreated in 1928, promoted the use of white lead pigments in residential paint by sponsoring\ntwo advertising campaigns, the Forest Products Better Paint campaign and the White Lead\nPromotion campaign, in the first half of the 20th century. The LIA knew that white lead\nwas being attacked from “a health standpoint,” and these campaigns were designed to\nincrease the consumption of lead.\n       The LIA provided its members with information about lead hazards and lead\npoisoning that was available in medical and scientific literature at the time. NL was present\nat a 1930 LIA board of directors meeting at which a 1930 article about lead poisoning of\nbabies and children from chewing lead paint off of cribs was discussed. The article, which\nran in the U.S. Daily, a publication “Presenting the Official News” of the government,\nstated that lead poisoning from “chewing paint from toys, cradles, and woodwork” was “a\nmore frequent occurrence” than previously thought and noted that even a small amount of\nlead could kill a child. The article also noted that “[c]hildren are very susceptible to lead”\nand that the “most common sources of lead poisoning in children are paint on various\nobjects within reach of a child and lead pipes . . . .”\n\n\n16\n       Some of SWC’s paints did not contain white lead pigment.\n                                                10\n\f        In 1934, the LIA launched its Forest Products campaign, which promoted lead paint\nfor interior residential use. At a 1935 LIA annual meeting, it was acknowledged that\nchildhood lead poisoning disproportionately affected poor and minority children and that\nthere were thousands of cases annually. Yet the LIA fought against the imposition of\nregulations on lead. A 1937 LIA conference on lead poisoning was attended by\nrepresentatives from NL and SWC, and Fuller received a transcript of the conference. Both\nindustrial lead poisoning and childhood lead poisoning were discussed at the 1937\nconference. There was discussion of research that showed it was nearly impossible to get\nrid of lead once it got into a child’s body. Attendees at the conference were asked by the\nhead of the LIA not to discuss what they learned at the conference in order to avoid\nunfavorable publicity connecting lead paint to lead poisoning. The LIA’s Forest Products\ncampaign continued through 1941.\n        The NPVLA, unlike the LIA, represented paint manufacturers regardless of whether\n                           17\nthey used lead pigments.         The NPVLA ran advertising campaigns promoting paint\nthroughout the first half of the 20th century. One was called Save the Surface in 1920 and\n1921. The other was called Clean Up Paint Up and was ongoing in 1949. All three\ncompanies were involved in both advertising campaigns. Neither of the NPVLA’s\ncampaigns distinguished between lead paint and non-lead paint, but these campaigns\nincluded advertisements promoting all three companies’ lead paint products.\n        Lead paint was banned in the United States in 1978. (County of Santa Clara v.\nAtlantic Richfield Co. (2006) 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 302 (Santa Clara I).) In 1991, the\nCenters for Disease Control (the CDC) set the “level of concern” for lead at a blood lead\n                                18\nlevel (BLL) of 10 mcg/dL.            In 2012, the CDC replaced this standard with a “reference\n\n\n17\n     Fuller was a member of the NPVLA from 1933 to 1962. NL was an NPVLA\nmember from 1933 to 1977. SWC was a member of the NPVLA from 1933 to 1981.\n18\n        The impact of blood lead levels below 10 mcg/dL was not well understood until\n2005.\n                                                    11\n\fvalue” of 5 mcg/dL, which represents the top 2.5 percent of BLLs in children under the age\nof five. “[T]he reference value simply denotes the worst or the highest exposed children in\na population.” At that point, national data reflected that 5.3 percent of children living in\npre-1950 housing had BLLs exceeding that value, while only 0.4 percent of children living\nin post-1978 housing had BLLs exceeding that value.\n       In 1995, the California Legislature enacted the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention\nAct of 1991. (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 105275, 124125; Stats. 1995, ch. 415, § 8.) This act\ncreated the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP). (Health & Saf. Code,\n§ 124125.) The Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch (CLPPB), a division of\nCalifornia’s Department of Public Health, was accorded the role of coordinating the state’s\napproach to childhood lead exposure and childhood lead poisoning. The CLPPB devotes its\nresources to outreach, education, case management programs to track those who have been\nlead poisoned or exposed to lead, and programs to address lead hazards. The CLPPB also\ncontracts with and supervises 43 county CLPPPs.\n       The CLPPB focuses on children who are one or two years old. Health care providers\nare required to order that a child be screened for lead poisoning at age one and at age two if\n“the child receives services from a publicly funded program for low-income children.”\n(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 37100.) Medical laboratories are required to report all BLLs to\nthe CLPPB. (Health & Saf. Code, § 124130; Stats. 2002, ch. 931, § 11.) The CLPPB\nconsiders it a “case” of lead poisoning if a child’s BLL exceeds 19.5 mcg/dL or persistently\nexceeds 14.5 mcg/dL. In such cases, a public health nurse and an environmental health\nspecialist visit the child’s home to try to determine potential sources of the lead poisoning.\n       National average BLLs have declined precipitously since the 1970s, falling by about\n90 percent. In 1980, it was estimated that 88.3 percent of children had BLLs in excess of 10\nmcg/dL. By 2008, it was estimated that less than one percent of children had BLLs over 10\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f          19\nmcg/dL.        Nevertheless, in 2010, around 22,000 children under the age of six in California\nhad BLLs over 4.5 mcg/dL. And at the time of trial in 2013, California had more than\n2,000 children with BLLs over 10 mcg/dL and more than 15,000 additional children with\nBLLs over 5 mcg/dL. Children in California with BLLs over 9.5 mcg/dL represented 0.35\n                                     20\npercent of California’s children.\n       Children in the 10 jurisdictions are continuing to be exposed to lead from the lead\npaint in their homes and to suffer deleterious effects from that lead. Although only a small\npercentage of the children in these jurisdictions are screened for lead, thousands of children\nare found to have BLLs of concern each year.\n       Lead poisoning from lead paint is “the number one environmental children’s\nhealth issue in Alameda County.” The primary cause of lead poisoning in Alameda County\nis lead paint. About 75 percent of Alameda County’s homes are pre-1980, which amounts\nto 430,000 units. Nearly 174,000 of those units are pre-1950. Alameda County is able to\nscreen only 46 percent of the children under the age of six who are poor and live in pre-\n1978 homes. Alameda County’s CLPPP opens a case only when there is a lead-poisoned\nchild with a BLL of 20 mcg/dL or two BLLs of 15 mcg/dL. In 2012, 14 children met that\nstandard in Alameda County. That triggers an investigation of the home and education of\nthe parents about sources of exposure. There is no funding for remediation. Alameda\nCounty’s CLPPP also tries to do outreach and education to families with children who have\n                                21\nBLLs of 5 mcg/dL or higher, but there is no funding for dealing with these children. In\n2010, there were 14 children in that category.\n\n\n\n19\n      The prevalence of elevated BLLs in children under the age of six in California\nappeared to have declined 60 percent from 2003 to 2010.\n20\n     Because the laboratories doing the tests lack the ability to report precise results,\nBLLs of 4.5 are rounded up to 5 and BLLs of 9.5 are rounded up to 10.\n21\n       The limits of detection do not permit such precise measurement, so the CLPPP\nactually provides these services when the BLL is over 4.5 mcg/dL.\n                                                13\n\f       Lead poisoning is the top pediatric environmental health problem in Los Angeles\nCounty. The most common source of lead poisoning in Los Angeles County is lead paint\nchips and lead paint dust. Lead paint is a “severe environmental health concern” in Los\nAngeles County. In Los Angeles County, 77 percent of the housing was built before 1978,\nwhich is more than 2.6 million housing units. More than 900,000 of those housing units are\npre-1950. Los Angeles County’s investigators have often found lead paint dust in homes\nwith intact lead paint. In 2010, Los Angeles County had about 6,500 children under the age\nof six with BLLs of greater than 4.5 mcg/dl. Los Angeles County’s CLPPP generally does\nnot do “primary prevention” but only screening and “secondary prevention.” Los Angeles\nCounty’s CLPPP handles about 75 to 100 cases of lead poisoning each year. In at least 75\npercent of those cases, lead paint is a potential source of the lead poisoning. At least 70\npercent of those cases involve pre-1978 housing.\n       Lead paint is a serious environmental health concern in Monterey County. In\nMonterey County, 66 percent of the housing was built before 1980, which accounts for\nbetween 89,000 and 90,000 units. Between 18,000 and 19,000 of those units were built\nbefore 1950. Each year, Monterey County’s CLPPP receives between 13 and 15 new cases\nwhere there has been a report of a BLL of 20 mcg/dL or two BLLs of 14.5 mcg/dL or\ngreater. The children are generally between the ages of one and three. For those cases, it\nconducts a full assessment of the home. Each month Monterey County receives 10 to 20\nreports of a child with a BLL of 4.5 mcg/dL or higher. A substantial number of cases of\nlead poisoning in Monterey County have been attributed to imported foods.\n       Lead-based paint hazards in Oakland homes are “coming close to crisis mode.” In\nOakland, 80 to 90 percent of the housing is pre-1978, which accounts for about 174,000\nunits. Each year, Oakland’s Lead Safe Housing Program receives 16 to 20 referrals from\nAlameda County’s CLPPP to assess homes where lead-poisoned children live.\n       In the City of San Diego, 60.5 percent of the housing was built before 1980. There\nare about 300,000 pre-1978 housing units of which more than 62,000 are pre-1950. The\n\n                                              14\n\fCity of San Diego has a Lead Safety Healthy Homes Program that offers education,\noutreach, risk assessments, and lead inspections. More than half of the 2,700 lead\ninspections completed in the City of San Diego between 2005 and 2013 identified lead\nhazards.\n       In San Francisco, 94 percent of the homes were built before 1978, which is more\nthan 317,000 housing units, and 68 percent were built before 1950, which is more than\n235,000 housing units. About 22,000 housing units in San Francisco that are occupied by\nlow and moderate income families are believed to have lead-based paint hazards. San\nFrancisco’s CLPPP contacts parents when a child tests at 2 mcg/dL or higher. Only very\ninfrequently is the source of the child’s lead exposure anything other than lead paint. In\n2010, when San Francisco tested 10,300 children under the age of six, 959 children tested\nbetween 4.5 and 9.5 mcg/dL, and 35 tested higher. Since 2010, San Francisco has been\n“seeing increasing numbers” of lead exposed children. Each year, San Francisco issues\nabout 200 notices to correct lead paint and soil lead hazards.\n       The number one source of lead poisoning in San Mateo County is lead paint. Lead\npaint in pre-1978 housing is a public health problem in San Mateo County. This includes\nintact lead paint because it will inevitably deteriorate. In San Mateo County, 80 to 90\npercent of the housing is pre-1978, which is more than 200,000 housing units. More than\n56,000 of those units are pre-1950.\n       “[L]ead paint is the number one environmental cause of poisoning of children in\nSanta Clara County” and is a threat to public health there. In Santa Clara County, two-\nthirds of the housing stock is pre-1978, which is more than 426,000 housing units. More\nthan 61,000 of those are pre-1950. Although in 2010 Santa Clara County could only afford\nto test less than 20 percent of the more than 150,000 children under the age of six who lived\nin the county, 339 of them had BLLs between 4.5 mcg/dL and 9.5 mcg/dL, and 71 had\nBLLs over 9.5 mcg/dL. Most of the children with elevated BLLs lived in pre-1978 housing.\n“[O]nce those children are determined to be lead poisoned, it is too late.”\n\n                                              15\n\f       Lead poisoning of children is a “very significant problem” in Solano County, and it\n“causes substantial harm even at the lowest levels of exposure” such as 5 mcg/dL. “The\nharm is very substantial, the harm is permanent. Children’s IQs are affected . . . they have\nimpairment of memory, difficulty with problem solving, inattentiveness . . . .” Only about\n20 percent of the 32,000 children under age six in Solano County are tested for lead. This is\ndue to lack of access to medical care for poor children. In 2010, at least 100 children in\nSolano County had BLLs over 4.5 mcg/dL. Between 2001 and 2012, the sole source of lead\nexposure was lead paint for 55 percent of the children in Solano County with a BLL of 20\nmcg/dL or higher or two BLLs of 15 mcg/dL. In many of the other cases, lead paint was a\ncontributing source. Between 75,000 and 80,000 homes in Solano County were built before\n1978, which is about 51 percent of all of the homes. More than 18,000 of those units are\npre-1950. Solano County has no resources for code enforcement of lead paint hazards in\nhomes or for remediation.\n       Ventura County has almost 174,000 pre-1978 housing units. Almost 20,000 of those\nare pre-1950. In 2010, Ventura County had 34 children with BLLs higher than 10 mcg/dL\nand 271 children with BLLs over 5 mcg/dL. Ventura County’s CLPPP does not do any\nenvironmental investigation as to children with BLLs between 5 and 15 mcg/dL. For those\nchildren, Ventura’s CLPPP provides only educational material.\n       The CLPPPs lack the ability to engage in primary prevention, which seeks to prevent\nlead exposure in the first place. Instead, the CLPPPs largely target children who have\nalready been exposed to lead. Abatement would be primary prevention. Although it is not\nfeasible to remove all lead from every home in the 10 jurisdictions, primary prevention\ncould be substantially furthered by lead inspections, risk assessments, education, and\nremediation of identified lead hazards in homes in the 10 jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f                                II. Defense Evidence At Trial\n       BLLs in children under the age of six nationally have been dropping since the 1970s,\ngoing from a geometric mean of 15 mcg/dL in the late 1970s to 1 mcg/dL in 2009/2010.\nThe percentage of children under the age of six with BLLs exceeding 10 mcg/dL has\ndropped over that period from more than 80 percent to less than one-half of one percent. A\nsimilar drop has occurred for children under the age of six with BLLs over 5 mcg/dL. The\nsame is true in the western region, which includes California, where the geometric mean for\nBLLs is about 25 to 30 percent lower than in other regions. In most of the 10 jurisdictions,\nBLLs and the percentage of elevated BLLs also dropped from 2007 to 2012.\n       A defense expert testified that the lower BLLs reflected decreasing exposure of\nchildren to lead. It was his opinion that leaded gasoline was largely responsible for both\nsoil lead and dust lead and that there was “very little impact of exposure to lead from paint\non community-wide blood lead levels.”\n       Another defense expert testified that the current understanding of childhood lead\npoisoning was unknown before 1970. In his view, the amount of lead considered toxic and\nawareness of “the pathway by which lead gets into the child’s body” had both “changed\nradically over the years.” He asserted that in the first decade of the 20th century lead\npoisoning was considered an “industrial disease of adults.” No tests were available to\nmeasure a BLL. It was not until the 1930s that a BLL test became available. This defense\nexpert testified that, prior to 1920, there were no cases in the United States of a child\ningesting lead paint from a household surface. By 1940, interior use of lead paint was\ndwindling. In 1951, Baltimore banned lead paint for interior use. In 1953, there was a\ngeneral call for lead paint not to be used for interiors.\n       This defense expert testified that in 1971, the medical community’s understanding\nwas that lead poisoning did not cause significant symptoms until the BLL exceeded 60\nmcg/dL. In 1970, the United States Surgeon General determined that a BLL of 40 mcg/dL\nshould be considered “evidence suggestive of undue absorption of lead . . . .” It was not\n\n                                                17\n\frecognized until 1974 that children could consume lead originating from lead paint from\nhousehold dust, rather than only from flakes and chips. In 1985, the CDC set an\n“intervention level” for BLLs at 25 mcg/dL. In 1991, the CDC set the “level of concern”\nfor BLLs at 10 mcg/dL.\n       A defense epidemiologist testified that it was not clear even in 2003 whether BLLs\nbelow 10 mcg/dL produced cognitive deficits. This expert testified that a subsequent study\nauthored by one of plaintiff’s experts showing such deficits was flawed. This expert had\nnot studied childhood lead exposure, but he testified that the evidence was inconclusive\nwhether there were cognitive effects of BLLs below 10 mcg/dL.\n       SWC presented a statistician who testified that SWC had contributed only 6,732 tons\nof lead to California over the period from 1894 to 2009 out of a total of 217,784 tons of lead\nconsumed in California during that period, which was just “.1 percent” of the total lead. On\ncross-examination, he conceded that his estimate was limited to lead manufactured by SWC\nbetween 1910 and 1947, which was the only period when SWC manufactured lead. SWC\ncontinued to make lead paint after 1947. His estimate was also based primarily on national\ndata about lead consumption to which he had applied a ratio based solely on population to\ndetermine what he thought was California’s consumption.\n       Another defense expert testified that lead paint does not inevitably deteriorate. He\nasserted that if lead paint is “maintained properly and re-coated as needed on a regular\nmaintenance cycle,” it will not deteriorate. His premise was that repainting would be\nneeded every three to five years. On cross-examination, he admitted that lead paint would\ndeteriorate over time, particularly on friction surfaces like windows. He also admitted that\nrepainting would require surface preparation, which would often mean sanding or scraping,\nin order to provide a surface to which the new paint would adhere.\n       The defense’s abatement expert testified that the replacement of windows and doors\nthat have been painted with lead paint is “a very intrusive and disruptive process” that\ninvolves “guys in moon suits, [and] respirators.” That process can disturb other hazardous\n\n                                              18\n\fwaste, such as asbestos, and lead to the discovery of mold issues. The remediation of floors\nand soil would also be invasive, labor intensive, and time consuming. He also suggested\nthat the abatement plan’s cost estimates for remediation were unrealistically low. He\nbelieved that remediation would often take a week or more and could increase the risk of\nlead exposure for the residents of the home. He also testified that replacing windows does\nnot lower BLLs and that remediation can result in higher BLLs.\n\n\n                                     III. Procedural Background\n       In March 2011, plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint (FAC) for public\n            22\nnuisance.        It named as defendants ConAgra, NL, SWC, Atlantic Richfield Company\n                                                                                             23\n(ARCO), E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), and 50 Doe defendants.                      The\nFAC alleged that the presence of lead in homes was a public nuisance and that defendants\nwere “liable in public nuisance” because they had created or assisted in the creation of this\n                    24\npublic nuisance.         Plaintiff sought abatement, injunctive relief, costs, and attorney’s fees.\nThe parties stipulated that the FAC concerned only residential buildings and no public\nbuildings.\n       The court struck defendants’ jury demands, and the case was tried to the court in July\nand August 2013. In March 2014, the court issued an amended statement of decision and an\namended judgment. The court’s amended statement of decision, which was over 100 pages\n\n\n22\n       We need not discuss at length the long and complicated procedural history of this\ncase, which was originally filed in 2000. This case has already produced one published\ndecision by this court (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th 292) and another by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court (2010) 50 Cal.4th 35\n(Santa Clara II)). We will discuss these decisions only where they are relevant to the issues\nbefore us in this appeal.\n23\n        The trial court found that ARCO and DuPont were not liable, and they are not parties\nto this appeal.\n24\n      Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC was overruled. The court also denied summary\njudgment motions by NL and SWC.\n                                                    19\n\flong, made numerous findings. The court expressly found that, “[s]ince antiquity, it has\nbeen well known that lead is highly toxic and causes severe health consequences when\ningested” and that “[e]ven relatively low levels of lead exposure have severe health\nconsequences.” It found that lead paint is prevalent in the 10 jurisdictions, “inevitably\ndeteriorates,” and is the primary source of lead exposure for young children living in pre-\n1978 housing in the 10 jurisdictions. As a result, children in these jurisdictions are\ncontinuing to be exposed to lead from lead paint even though residential lead paint was\nbanned in 1978. The court expressly found that ConAgra, NL, and SWC each had “actual\nknowledge of the hazards of lead paint,” “including childhood lead poisoning,” when they\npromoted lead paint for interior residential use. The court’s judgment required defendants\nto pay $1.15 billion into an abatement fund that would pay for lead inspections, education\nabout lead hazards, and remediation of particular lead hazards inside residences in the 10\n                                                            25\njurisdictions. Defendants timely filed notices of appeal.\n\n\n                                        IV. Discussion\n                               A. Substantial Evidence Issues\n       A public nuisance cause of action is established by proof that a defendant knowingly\ncreated or assisted in the creation of a substantial and unreasonable interference with a\npublic right. (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 305-306.)\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to produce substantial evidence in support of\nits public nuisance cause of action. They assert that substantial evidence does not support\nthe trial court’s findings that (1) they had actual knowledge of the public health hazard\nposed by interior use of lead paint at the time they promoted and distributed it; (2) they\npromoted lead paint for interior use; (3) their conduct caused the public nuisance to occur;\n\n\n\n\n25\n       Plaintiff also appealed, but it later dismissed its appeal.\n                                               20\n\fand (4) the nuisance is abatable, lead paint poses an imminent danger, and abatement will\nlower BLLs.\n                                    1. Standard of Review\n       Defendants contend that their claims that substantial evidence does not support the\ntrial court’s judgment raise questions of law that we must review de novo. They cite Smith\nv. Selma Community Hosp. (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 1478 (Smith) as support for this\ncontention. Smith is inapposite. In Smith, the Court of Appeal was reviewing a governing\nboard’s decision reviewing a judicial review committee’s decision. The board, which was\nexercising substantial evidence review, concluded that the committee’s decision was not\nsupported by substantial evidence. Since the Court of Appeal was reviewing the board’s\ndecision that substantial evidence did not support the committee’s decision, the Court of\nAppeal necessarily exercised independent review. (Smith, at pp. 1515-1516.) As we are not\nreviewing another reviewing body’s decision as to whether a third body’s decision was\nsupported by substantial evidence, we do not exercise independent review. Instead, we\nexercise ordinary deferential substantial evidence review.\n       “ ‘When a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial\nevidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the\ndetermination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted\nwhich will support the finding of fact.’ ” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) 3 Cal.3d\n875, 881.) “ ‘[W]e have no power to judge of the effect or value of the evidence, to weigh\nthe evidence, to consider the credibility of the witnesses, or to resolve conflicts in the\nevidence or in the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom.’ ” (Leff v. Gunter\n(1983) 33 Cal.3d 508, 518.) Our role is limited to determining whether the evidence before\nthe trier of fact supports its findings. (Reddy v. Gonzalez (1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 118, 123.)\n       Defendants claim that we may not presume implied findings in plaintiff’s favor\nbecause there were “key ambiguities” in the trial court’s statement of decision that they\nbrought to the court’s attention but the court did not resolve.\n\n                                               21\n\f       “When a statement of decision does not resolve a controverted issue, or if the\nstatement is ambiguous and the record shows that the omission or ambiguity was brought to\nthe attention of the trial court . . . , it shall not be inferred on appeal . . . that the trial court\ndecided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue.” (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 634.) “To bring defects in a statement of decision to the trial court’s attention within the\nmeaning of section 634, objections to a statement of decision must be ‘specific.’ [Citation.]\nThe alleged omission or ambiguity must be identified with sufficient particularity to allow\nthe trial court to correct the defect. [Citation.] ‘By filing specific objections to the court’s\nstatement of decision a party pinpoints alleged deficiencies in the statement and allows the\ncourt to focus on the facts or issues the party contends were not resolved or whose\nresolution is ambiguous.’ ” (Ermoian v. Desert Hospital (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 475, 498.)\n“[A] trial court is not required to respond point by point to issues posed in a request for a\nstatement of decision. ‘ “The court’s statement of decision is sufficient if it fairly discloses\nthe court’s determination as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case.”\n[Citations.]’ ” (Id. at p. 500.)\n       After trial, each defendant submitted a proposed statement of decision, and plaintiff\nsubmitted proposed findings of fact and law and a proposed order. In December 2013, the\ncourt issued a proposed statement of decision. Plaintiff and defendants filed objections to\nthe proposed statement of decision. The court subsequently filed an amended statement of\n                                        26\ndecision and an amended judgment.\n       Defendants’ appellate briefs identify six “key ambiguities” that they assert they\nbrought to the court’s attention but the court failed to address in its statement of decision.\n\n\n26\n       In January 2014, the court issued a statement of decision. Plaintiff submitted a\nproposed judgment, and defendants objected to the proposed judgment. The court entered\njudgment followed by an amended judgment. Defendants moved to vacate the judgment\nand for a new trial. The court denied the motions for new trial and to vacate the judgment.\nPlaintiff moved to modify the statement of decision and the judgment, and the court filed an\namended statement of decision and a second amended judgment.\n                                                   22\n\fThe alleged “ambiguities” they identify are: (1) “Whether the court found any part of\ndefendants’ recitation of the historical knowledge of lead hazards to be incorrect;” (2)\n“What level of lead exposure the court referred to as being ‘lead poisoning’ ”; (3) “What\nfacts about lead’s hazards the court found that defendants ‘actually knew’ ”; (4) “Which of\ndefendants’ promotions for interior paint the court found to be a basis for liability”; (5) “On\nwhat basis the court included housing built after 1950”; and (6) “what public rights.”\n       “[I]t is settled that the trial court need not, in a statement to decision, ‘address all the\nlegal and factual issues raised by the parties.’ [Citation.] It ‘is required only to set out\nultimate findings rather than evidentiary ones.’ [Citation.] ‘ “[U]ltimate fact[]” ’ is a\nslippery term, but in general it refers to a core fact, such as an element of a claim or defense,\nwithout which the claim or defense must fail. [Citation.] It is distinguished conceptually\nfrom ‘evidentiary facts’ and ‘conclusions of law.’ ” (Yield Dynamics, Inc. v. TEA Systems\nCorp. (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 547, 559.)\n       Only one of defendants’ six alleged “ambiguities” arguably pertains to a “core fact”\nrather than an evidentiary fact. SWC’s objections to the court’s proposed statement of\ndecision asked the court to “define ‘harmful’ ” with respect to defendants’ knowledge of\nlead’s harmful nature. SWC argued that this was important because the state of knowledge\nat the time defendants promoted lead paint did not include knowledge of the risks of low-\nlevel exposure to deteriorating lead paint. ConAgra adopted SWC’s objections and also\nasked the court to “specify what hazard it finds that Fuller knew when it promoted lead\npaint for residential interior use, and when Fuller knew exposure to lead at even minute\nlevels was harmful.” ConAgra requested that the court specify “what ‘harm’ each\ndefendant ‘knew.’ ” NL objected to the court’s proposed knowledge findings and asked that\nthe court “specifically identify the knowledge that NL had at that time.” We address the\ncourt’s treatment of the “harms” and “hazards” issue in the course of our analysis of\ndefendants’ challenge to the court’s knowledge findings. In all other respects, we reject\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fdefendants’ claim that the court failed to resolve an ambiguity as to a “core fact” because\nwe conclude that the alleged ambiguities concerned evidentiary facts.\n       Before we embark on our substantial evidence review, we note that we cannot rely\nsolely on the expert testimony produced by plaintiff. Plaintiff’s expert witnesses testified to\nconclusions that would appear on their face to establish both the actual knowledge and\npromotion elements of plaintiff’s case. One of plaintiff’s experts testified: “These\nDefendants manufactured white lead carbonate; these Defendants knew of the hazards of\nlead during the time that they were manufacturing white lead carbonate; these Defendants\nadvertised, promoted, and sold their lead and/or lead [based] products while they had\nknowledge of the hazards of lead; these Defendants advertised, promoted, and sold their\nlead and/or lead containing products for use in and around homes within each of the 10\njurisdictions; suitable substitutes were available for white lead; these Defendants, through\ntheir trade association, downplayed the hazards of lead; and these Defendants, through their\ntrade associations, fought the imposition of regulations.” And plaintiff’s experts testified to\neven more specific conclusions: “Sherwin-Williams had actual knowledge about the\nhazards of lead as early as 1900.”\n       If we could accept plaintiff’s expert witnesses’ testimony at face value, this\ntestimony would itself support the trial court’s findings. However, we may not do so.\n“ ‘The chief value of an expert’s testimony in this field, as in all other fields, rests upon the\nmaterial from which his opinion is fashioned and the reasoning by which he progresses\nfrom his material to his conclusion; . . . it does not lie in his mere expression of\n              27\nconclusion.’ ”     (People v. Bassett (1968) 69 Cal.2d 122, 141.) “Where an expert bases his\n\n\n27\n       The material upon which the expert relies may provide substantial evidence to\nsupport the expert’s conclusion. However, there are limitations on an expert’s testimony\nabout that material. “What an expert cannot do is relate as true case-specific facts asserted\nin hearsay statements, unless they are independently proven by competent evidence or are\ncovered by a hearsay exception.” (People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 Cal.4th 665, 686.) We will\nconsider defendants’ hearsay challenges in section IV(J)(1) of this opinion.\n                                                24\n\fconclusion upon assumptions which are not supported by the record, upon matters which\nare not reasonably relied upon [by] other experts, or upon factors which are speculative,\nremote or conjectural, then his conclusion has no evidentiary value. [Citations.] In those\ncircumstances the expert’s opinion cannot rise to the dignity of substantial evidence.\n[Citation.] When a trial court has accepted an expert’s ultimate conclusion without critical\nconsideration of his reasoning and it appears the conclusion was based upon improper or\nunwarranted matters, then the judgment must be reversed for lack of substantial evidence.”\n(Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Zuckerman (1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 1113, 1135-1136.) “If\n[the expert’s] opinion is not based upon facts otherwise proved, or assumes facts contrary to\nthe only proof, it cannot rise to the dignity of substantial evidence.” (Estate of Powers\n(1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 480, 485-486.)\n       Consequently, a conclusion expressed by an expert cannot provide by itself\nsubstantial evidence to support a finding unless the basis for the expert’s conclusion is itself\nsupported by substantial evidence. Our substantial evidence review must include a critical\nexamination of the material upon which the experts based their conclusions in order to\ndetermine whether that material provides substantial support for those conclusions.\n                                    2. Actual Knowledge\n       Defendants claim that the trial court did not find actual knowledge, but only\nconstructive knowledge, and that its knowledge findings are not supported by substantial\nevidence.\n       Constructive knowledge would not be sufficient to support plaintiff’s public nuisance\ncause of action. The standard set by this court in Santa Clara I is actual knowledge, not\nconstructive knowledge. “[L]iability is premised on defendants’ promotion of lead paint for\ninterior use with knowledge of the hazard that such use would create. This conduct is\ndistinct from and far more egregious than simply producing a defective product or failing to\nwarn of a defective product . . . . [¶] A public nuisance cause of action is not premised on a\ndefect in a product or a failure to warn but on affirmative conduct that assisted in the\n\n                                               25\n\fcreation of a hazardous condition. Here, the alleged basis for defendants’ liability for the\npublic nuisance created by lead paint is their affirmative promotion of lead paint for interior\nuse, not their mere manufacture and distribution of lead paint or their failure to warn of its\nhazards.” (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th 292, 309-310, boldface & italics added.)\nBy tethering the public nuisance cause of action to affirmative promotion for a use\ndefendants knew to be hazardous, this court necessarily set forth an actual knowledge\nstandard. If the standard had been only constructive knowledge, the affirmative promotion\nof a product for a particular use that was hazardous would not have been “far more\negregious” than simply failing to warn of a defective product.\n       We reject defendants’ claim that the trial court did not find “actual knowledge.” The\ntrial court’s statement of decision expressly found that all three defendants had “actual\nknowledge of the hazards of lead paint—including childhood lead poisoning” when they\nproduced, marketed, sold, and promoted lead paint for residential use. It found: “ConAgra\nhad actual knowledge of the hazards of lead paint—including childhood lead poisoning—\nfor the duration of its production, marketing, and sale of lead pigments and paint for home\nuse”; “NL had actual knowledge of the hazards of lead paint, including childhood lead\npoisoning”; “SW[C] had actual knowledge of the hazards of lead paint—including\nchildhood lead poisoning—for the duration of its production, marketing, and sale of lead\npigments and lead paint for home use.”\n       While the standard we established in Santa Clara I is actual knowledge, our\nsubstantial evidence review remains deferential, and we must accept any reasonable\ninferences that the trial court drew from the evidence before it. The fact that the trial court\nwas required to find actual knowledge does not mean that the court could not rely\nexclusively on circumstantial evidence to support such a finding. The only limit on the trial\ncourt’s reliance on inferences from circumstantial evidence to establish actual knowledge is\nthat those inferences may not be speculative or conjectural. “ ‘ “Actual knowledge can be\ninferred from the circumstances only if, in the light of the evidence, such inference is not\n\n                                               26\n\fbased on speculation or conjecture. Only where the circumstances are such that the\ndefendant ‘must have known’ and not ‘should have known’ will an inference of actual\nknowledge be permitted.” [Citation.]’ ” (Romero v. Superior Court (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th\n1068, 1082.) This distinction between what a defendant must have known and what a\ndefendant should have known is crucial. Proof of actual knowledge focuses on what\ninformation a defendant must have been aware of, while proof of constructive knowledge\nrests on a defendant’s duty to discover information.\n       We reject defendants’ claim that the court left undefined the nature of the “hazard” or\n“harm” that defendants had knowledge of when they promoted lead paint for interior\nresidential use. The court expressly found that defendants “learned about the harms of lead\nexposure through association-sponsored conferences.” It expressly found that defendants\nknew in the 1930s that “the dangers of lead paint to children were not limited to their toys,\nequipment, and furniture.” The court expressly found that defendants knew both that “high\nlevel exposure to lead—and, in particular, lead paint—was fatal” and that “lower level lead\nexposure harmed children.” The court also found that, by the 1920s, defendants knew that\n“lead paint used on the interiors of homes would deteriorate, and that lead dust resulting\nfrom this deterioration would poison children and cause serious injury.”\n       The trial court’s express findings made clear that the “harms” and “hazards” of\nwhich defendants had actual knowledge included that (1) “lower level lead exposure\nharmed children,” (2) “lead paint used on the interiors of homes would deteriorate,” and (3)\n“lead dust resulting from this deterioration would poison children and cause serious injury.”\nBecause the trial court made the express findings that defendants sought in their objections\nto the court’s proposed statement of decision, we are not precluded from drawing inferences\nin support of the trial court’s decision. In any case, the court’s express findings fully suffice\nto support its decision.\n       Here, the trial court properly focused on evidence of information that defendants\nmust have been aware of under the circumstances. This evidence was sufficient to support a\n\n                                               27\n\freasonable inference that each defendant must have known by the early 20th century that\ninterior residential lead paint posed a serious risk of harm to children.\n       First, evidence before the trial court established that, by 1914, it was well known in\nthe paint manufacturing industry that deteriorated lead paint on residential interiors,\nparticularly doors and windowsills, released “small particles” of lead into the air, which\nwere “very dangerous” to and could be ingested by humans and “poison” them.\n       In May 1910, the United States House of Representatives’ Committee on Interstate\nand Foreign Commerce held a hearing on a bill aimed at preventing lead poisoning. The\nbill would have required products containing white lead to “be labeled conspicuously and\nsecurely with a skull and crossbones and the words: ‘White lead: poison.’ ” Congressman\nRichard Bartholdt, who was the sponsor of the proposal, explained to the committee that\n“the painters of the United States,” who had originally opposed the proposal, had\n“practically all come around now” to supporting regulation of white lead. Bartholdt pointed\nout that France had already “entirely prohibited the use of white lead because of its injurious\ncharacter” and that “all countries of Europe” had already enacted legislation like his\nproposal.\n       Bartholdt explained: “We know very little of the injurious effect of these atoms of\nwhite lead that are filling the air now; they come loose from doors, from window sills, from\neverywhere, we inhale them and consequently disease is caused which physicians do not\nunderstand and can not say what it really is, but it is, in many cases, simply a case of lead\npoisoning.” One of the proponents of the bill told the committee that “the most eminent\nscientists and doctors of Great Britain” had “found that the small particles that result from\nchalking, especially from internal painting and external painting as well, when taken by\ninhalation into the lungs, are absorbed and become a poison to the system.” He also stated\nthat an “eminent scientist” in London had said that occupying a room that had been painted\nwith white lead was “dangerous.”\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f       Eugene Philbin attended the hearing as “counsel for, I think, practically all of the\npaint manufacturers of this country—the leading ones,” to state their opposition to the\nproposal. Philbin said that he represented not only the “Paint Manufacturers’ Association”\nbut also the “National Paint, Oil, and Varnish Association.” Philbin objected to the “poison\nprovision” on the ground that it was “entirely unnecessary” and would “create a fear on the\npart of the consumer.” The bill failed.\n       A few years later, in 1914, Gardner, the director of the Paint Manufacturers\nAssociation’s Educational Bureau, published a speech that he had given to the International\nAssociation of Master House Painters and Decorators of the United States and Canada at\nthat association’s annual convention in February 1914. In this speech, Gardner\nacknowledged that “the presence of [white lead] dust in the atmosphere of a room is very\ndangerous to the health of the inmates.” He observed that “[l]ead poisoning may occur\nthrough inhalation of [lead] dust . . . .” Gardner suggested that “white lead flatted with\n                                                                                            28\nturpentine” was to blame for the disintegration of white lead paint into white lead dust.\nHowever, Gardner expressed the belief that “the use of flatted white lead has been largely\nabandoned for wall and ceiling decoration, and its place has been taken by the more sanitary\nleadless Flat Wall Paints.”\n       Notwithstanding Gardner’s belief, interior residential use of lead paint continued\nthroughout the first half of the 20th century despite widespread knowledge in the paint\nindustry of the toxic properties of white lead. NL, SWC, and Fuller were all leaders in the\nlead paint industry. SWC proclaimed itself in 1901 to be “the largest manufacturer of\nPrepared Paint in the world.” In 1934, SWC called itself the “World’s Largest Paint\nProducer” and identified itself as “one of the country’s largest producers of White Lead.”\n\n\n\n28\n       In 1914, it had long been a common practice to mix lead paint with turpentine. That\npractice did not end. Fuller’s 1931 White Lead Paint brochure instructed users to mix the\nlead paint with turpentine. NL’s 1950 Handbook on Painting recommended mixing lead\npaint with turpentine when painting interior woodwork.\n                                              29\n\fNL took pride in its position as a leader in the white lead industry since 1891. In 1912, NL\nmade more than 20 different brands of Dutch Boy White Lead for painting, the brand that it\nhad adopted in 1907. By the late 19th century, Fuller was the leading seller of white lead on\nthe West Coast and was “one of the strongest concerns dealing in paints, oils and glass in\nthe United States.”\n       NL, SWC, and Fuller, as leaders in the lead paint industry were well aware in the\nearly part of the 20th century that lead dust was poisonous. They were also aware that lead\npaint “powders and chalks” “soon after it is applied” and routinely produces lead dust after\na couple of years. Both the May 1910 congressional hearing and the published 1914 Paint\nManufacturing Association speech plainly discussed the dangers posed by interior\nresidential use of lead paint. Because defendants were leaders in the paint industry at that\ntime, they must have been aware of hazards related to their products that were well known\nin the paint industry. It is neither speculative nor conjectural to draw a reasonable inference\nthat leaders in the paint industry were aware of a serious hazard caused by their product\nwhen this hazard was generally known in their industry. Indeed, it would be unreasonable\nto infer that, notwithstanding general knowledge of the hazard of their products within the\nindustry, defendants somehow managed to avoid learning of this hazard.\n       Second, the reasonable inference arising from the 1910 and 1914 evidence of what\nwas generally known in the paint industry was further supported by evidence that Fuller,\nNL, and SWC were each the recipient of confirmatory information about this hazard from\nthe LIA in the 1930s. Each of the defendants was a member of the LIA in the 1930s when\nthe LIA promulgated information to its members about the “frequent occurrence” of\nchildren being poisoned by lead paint from “toys, cradles, and woodwork,” which included\nthe fact that even a small amount of lead could kill a child. The LIA information given to\nits members (including all three defendants) referenced a national newspaper article that had\nstated that “[c]hildren are very susceptible to lead” and that the “most common sources of\nlead poisoning in children are paint on various objects within reach of a child and lead\n\n                                              30\n\fpipes . . . .” Defendants, as the recipients of this information from the LIA, must have been\naware at that time, in the early 1930s, of the hazard to children created by the interior\nresidential use of lead paint. The fact that this information confirmed the prior information\nof which they also must have been aware served to solidify the foundation for the trial\ncourt’s actual knowledge findings.\n         All of this evidence provided substantial support for the trial court’s actual\nknowledge findings as to the three defendants under our deferential standard of review.\n“The fact that it is possible to draw some inference other than that drawn by the trier of fact\nis of no consequence. . . . We must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference . . . .” (Jessup\nFarms v. Baldwin (1983) 33 Cal.3d 639, 660.)\n         Here, the evidence, while circumstantial, was sufficient to support reasonable\ninferences that defendants must have known in the early 20th century that interior residential\nlead paint posed a serious risk of harm to children. Since these reasonable inferences\nsupport the trier of fact’s express findings that NL, SWC, and Fuller harbored the requisite\nactual knowledge, our deferential standard of review precludes us from drawing contrary\ninferences, and we must uphold the trial court’s actual knowledge findings.\n         ConAgra claims that there was no evidence that its predecessor, Fuller, knew in the\nearly 20th century that the use of lead paint in residential interiors would pose a public\nhealth hazard. It maintains that Fuller either did not know that children were consuming\nlead paint or knew of only “isolated cases” of such behavior that did not amount to a public\nhealth hazard. ConAgra also contends that Fuller could not have been aware of the risk of\nlower BLLs, since no test for BLLs existed at the time, and could not have known of the\nspecific pathways by which children consume lead dust, which were not proved until much\nlater.\n         By 1914, as a major producer of lead paint since the previous century, Fuller was\nwell aware of the public health hazard posed to children by interior residential lead paint.\n\n                                                31\n\fThe 1910 congressional hearing and the 1914 published speech provide very strong\ncircumstantial evidence of Fuller’s actual knowledge. Fuller could not have failed to learn\nfrom the hearing and the article that deteriorated interior residential lead paint posed a “very\ndangerous” risk to the “health” of the inhabitants of those residences. Of course, this\nknowledge was reinforced by information that the LIA distributed to its members, including\nFuller, in the 1930s discussing how it was a “frequent occurrence” that children were\npoisoned by lead paint from “toys, cradles, and woodwork” and noting that even a small\n                                     29\namount of lead could kill a child.\n       In light of these facts, there is no merit to ConAgra’s claims that Fuller did not know\nchildren were consuming lead paint, that Fuller believed that such events were infrequent,\nand that Fuller could not have known that a small amount of lead could harm a child. Since\nFuller was aware that deteriorating interior residential lead paint exposed the occupants of\nthe residence to “very dangerous” lead dust, knowledge of the specific pathway by which\nchildren consume lead dust was not essential for Fuller to be aware that lead paint on\nresidential interiors posed a risk of serious harm to children.\n       ConAgra also claims that the evidence was insufficient to show Fuller’s knowledge\nbecause the trial court erroneously permitted plaintiff’s experts to opine about Fuller’s\n\n\n\n29\n       ConAgra contends that Fuller could not acquire knowledge through the LIA because\nthe LIA was not Fuller’s agent. It was Fuller’s own participation in the LIA that led it to\nacquire the requisite knowledge, not by means of any agency relationship between Fuller\nand the LIA.\n       ConAgra argues that the trial court could not reasonably rely on Fuller’s knowledge\nthrough the LIA because the court found that ARCO did not have knowledge through the\nLIA. The trial court’s finding as to ARCO did not expressly relate to the LIA. The court\nfound only that ARCO and its predecessors did not have knowledge of “adverse health\neffects from exposure to residential lead paint during the relevant time period.” Indeed, the\ncourt’s rejection of liability for ARCO was based primarily on a lack of evidence\nconnecting ARCO’s predecessors to the 10 jurisdictions. ConAgra makes no attempt to\ndemonstrate that the evidence of Fuller’s participation in the LIA was identical to that of\nARCO’s predecessors.\n                                               32\n\fknowledge. Since the material upon which the experts’ opinions were based provides\nsubstantial support for those opinions, the court did not err in admitting and relying on those\nopinions. We assess ConAgra’s claim that some of the documents relied on by the experts\nwere inadmissible hearsay in section IV(J)(1) of this opinion.\n       ConAgra asserts that Fuller was aware of the dangers of lead dust solely in the\noccupational context. As we have already explained, the evidence supports the trial court’s\nfinding that Fuller was aware of the risks posed by lead paint on residential interiors. We\nreject ConAgra’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s\nexpress finding that Fuller was aware of the public health hazard to children posed by lead\npaint in residential interiors.\n       NL claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court’s actual\nknowledge finding because plaintiff was required to prove that NL had “knowledge in the\nearly 1900s that children could get dangerous levels of blood lead from intact lead paint\nanywhere in any home . . . via invisible dust.” NL’s claim is misleading. Our review of the\ntrial court’s actual knowledge finding requires us to examine the record to determine\nwhether there is substantial evidence that NL knew in the early 1900s that interior\nresidential lead paint posed a significant risk of harm to children. We need not find\nevidence that NL understood precisely how children could be harmed by interior residential\nlead paint so long as there is substantial evidence that NL knew that interior residential lead\npaint posed a significant risk of harm to children.\n       Our examination of the record reveals that it contains substantial evidence that NL\nhad the requisite actual knowledge by 1914. The 1910 congressional hearing and the 1914\npublished speech were sufficient to make a leader in the lead paint industry aware of the\nrisk of serious harm that interior residential lead paint posed to children. NL claims that\nthere was not substantial evidence that it was aware in the early 20th century of the risks to\nchildren of “low-level” lead exposure. Since the information of which NL was aware\nsuggested that even adults were at serious risk from interior residential lead paint, NL could\n\n                                              33\n\fnot have failed to understand that the risk to children would be at least as great. NL, like\nFuller, subsequently gained further knowledge, from its participation in the LIA, that\nchildren who ingested even very small amounts of lead could suffer serious harm. The LIA\ninformed its members in the 1930s that even a small amount of lead could kill a child. And,\nat a 1937 LIA conference, a doctor informed LIA members that “[t]o get rid of the lead in\nchildren is almost impossible.”\n       We find substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court’s finding that NL\nhad actual knowledge of the risk of harm to children from interior residential lead paint.\n       SWC claims that the trial court’s finding that it had actual knowledge of the risk of\nharm to children from interior residential use of lead paint was based on “hindsight”\nbecause SWC could not have known “of today’s alleged risk to children from ultra-low\nBLLs that can come from ingesting lead in household dust.” SWC’s premise is flawed.\nThe trial court’s actual knowledge finding may be upheld if there is substantial evidence\nthat SWC was aware at the relevant time that interior residential lead paint posed a\nsignificant risk of harm to children. It was not necessary for there to be proof that SWC was\naware of the precise pathway by which children were exposed to lead and or that those\nharms could occur even at low BLL levels, particularly since there was no BLL test in\nexistence at the relevant time.\n       The evidence presented at trial established that SWC knew no later than 1900 that\nlead paint was prone to deterioration and that it posed a serious risk of harm to those\nexposed to it. SWC began making lead paint in 1880. By 1900, it knew that, because lead\nwas a “deadly cumulative poison,” and lead paint tended to deteriorate, lead paint could be\nseriously dangerous.\n       SWC claims that its knowledge in 1900 of risks from deteriorating lead paint was\nlimited to exterior use of lead paint, but the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\nSWC knew that the deterioration of interior residential lead paint would pose an even more\nserious risk that would be heightened with respect to young children who were necessarily\n\n                                              34\n\fconfined to the interiors of their homes. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the\ntrial court’s finding that SWC had actual knowledge of the serious risk of harm to children\nfrom interior residential lead paint.\n           3. Creating or Assisting in Creating a Public Nuisance: Promotion\n       Defendants challenge the trial court’s findings that they affirmatively promoted lead\npaint for interior residential use.\n       “ ‘[T]he critical question is whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation\nof the nuisance.’ ” (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 305-306.) “A public\nnuisance cause of action is not premised on a defect in a product or a failure to warn but on\naffirmative conduct that assisted in the creation of a hazardous condition. Here, the alleged\nbasis for defendants’ liability for the public nuisance created by lead paint is their\naffirmative promotion of lead paint for interior use, not their mere manufacture and\ndistribution of lead paint or their failure to warn of its hazards.” (Santa Clara I, at pp. 309-\n310, italics added.)\n       Defendants claim that the court could not base its promotion findings on their\n                                                       30\nadvertising without violating the First Amendment.          They also contend that reliance on the\n\n\n30\n        In a reply brief, defendants claim for the first time that we must apply a heightened\nstandard of substantial evidence review to the court’s promotion finding because “First\nAmendment rights are at stake.” Appellate courts ordinarily do not consider new issues\nraised for the first time in an appellant’s reply brief because such a tactic deprives the\nrespondent of the opportunity to respond to the contention. (Reichardt v. Hoffman (1997)\n52 Cal.App.4th 754, 764-765 (Reichardt).) It is only upon a showing of good cause for\nfailing to raise the issue earlier that an appellate court will address an issue that is initially\nraised in the reply brief. (Ibid.) We decline to address this issue as defendants have made\nno showing of good cause, and plaintiff has had no opportunity to address this issue.\n       Furthermore, the only case they cite in support of this claim is one in which the Court\nof Appeal acknowledged that a heightened standard of review is appropriate where the issue\nis whether a communication is unlawful. (San Francisco Unified School Dist. ex. rel.\nContreras v. First Student, Inc. (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1228.) In that case, the trial\ncourt had issued an injunction barring certain communications. (Id. at p. 1228.) Here, the\nonly plausible First Amendment issue is defendants’ contention that their “promotion” of\n                                                35\n\fpromotional advertising activities of the LIA and the NPVLA would violate their First\n                                            31\nAmendment right to free association.             In addition, the three defendants individually\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court’s findings that each of them\naffirmatively promoted lead paint for interior residential use.\n       Defendants’ reliance on the First Amendment is misplaced. While “the creation and\ndissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment”\n(Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc. (2011) 564 U.S. 552, 570), “[t]he Constitution . . . accords a\nlesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed\nexpression.” (Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Service Commission of New\nYork (1980) 447 U.S. 557, 562-563 (Central Hudson).) “[T]here can be no constitutional\nobjection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the\npublic about lawful activity. The government may ban forms of communication more likely\nto deceive the public than to inform it, [citations], or commercial speech related to illegal\n                         32\nactivity, [citation].”        (Central Hudson, at pp. 563-564.)\n       “[T]he State does not lose its power to regulate commercial activity deemed harmful\nto the public whenever speech is a component of that activity.” (Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar\n\n\nlead paint for interior residential use was protected by the First Amendment. The trial\ncourt’s order did not bar any communications. In any case, since we conclude as a matter of\nlaw that their advertisements were not protected by the First Amendment, application of a\nheightened standard of review would not assist defendants.\n31\n       Defendants objected in the trial court on First Amendment grounds to evidence that\nthey had used commercial speech to promote lead paint for interior residential use. They\nalso objected on First Amendment freedom of association grounds to evidence based on\ntheir membership in the LIA and the NPVLA. The court overruled both objections.\n32\n       “If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the\ngovernment’s power is more circumscribed. . . . Compliance with this requirement may be\nmeasured by two criteria. First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest\ninvolved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote\nsupport for the government’s purpose. Second, if the governmental interest could be served\nas well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions\ncannot survive.” (Central Hudson, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 564.)\n                                                      36\n\fAss’n (1978) 436 U.S. 447, 456.) The California Supreme Court has already acknowledged\nthat holding defendants liable in this case for the public nuisance created by their promotion\nof lead paint for interior residential use will not “prevent defendants from exercising any\nFirst Amendment right or any other liberty interest. Although liability may be based in part\non prior commercial speech, the remedy will not involve enjoining current or future\nspeech.” (Santa Clara II, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 55; see also People v. Superior Court\n(Olson) (1979) 96 Cal.App.3d 181, 195 [imposing civil “penalties for the negligent\ndissemination of untruthful or misleading advertising does not offend the First\nAmendment.”].)\n       Defendants’ lead paint promotional advertising and participation in trade-association-\nsponsored lead paint promotional advertising were not entitled to any First Amendment\nprotections. Promotion of lead paint for interior residential use necessarily implied that lead\npaint was safe for such use. If defendants promoted lead paint for interior residential use\nwhile knowing that such use would create a public health hazard, then their promotions\nwere misleading and not entitled to any First Amendment protection. If, on the other hand,\ndefendants did not promote lead paint for interior residential use, or did not know at the\ntime they did so that such use would create a public health hazard, those promotions would\nnot establish that defendants created or assisted in the creation of a public nuisance. As any\nwrongful promotions would be misleading and not entitled to First Amendment protection,\nwe find no First Amendment bar to the trial court’s reliance on defendants’ promotions.\n       Defendants also make individual challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to\nsupport the trial court’s findings that each of them affirmatively promoted lead paint for\ninterior residential use while knowing of the public health hazard that such use would\ncreate. Our review of these contentions requires us to examine, among other things, the\nhundreds of advertisements upon which plaintiff relied to show that defendants had\npromoted lead paint for interior residential use. We must note at the outset that, for a\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\fnumber of reasons, a large number of these advertisements did not promote interior\nresidential use of lead paint.\n            Some of these advertisements expressly promoted only exterior use of lead paint.\nOthers promoted a particular brand without specifying any particular paint. Numerous\nadvertisements promoted lead paint as “house paint” without expressly promoting it for\ninterior use.\n            Another group of these advertisements promoted interior use of a particular paint\nwithout identifying that paint as a lead paint, and without other evidence that the particular\npaint promoted for interior use in these advertisements was a lead paint. Stipulations\nbetween plaintiff and NL and between plaintiff and SWC established that certain paints\npromoted by NL and SWC were lead paints, but there was no such stipulation with regard to\nFuller or as to paint companies acquired by NL or SWC. And many of the advertisements\nwere not specific enough to identify the promoted paint as one of those identified in the\nstipulations.\n            Many of the advertisements were not placed by NL, SWC, or Fuller, but instead by a\npaint store or a hardware retailer. While there was evidence that SWC financed half of the\ncost of its authorized dealers’ local advertisements and that NL “consistently supported\ndealers’ local advertising,” plaintiff’s expert acknowledged that there was no such evidence\nas to Fuller. As there was no evidence that Fuller had any involvement in the placement of\nadvertisements by hardware and paint stores, advertisements by those stores cannot be\nattributed to Fuller and cannot show that Fuller promoted lead paint for interior residential\n       33\nuse.\n\n\n\n33\n        For instance, a 1916 Santa Clara County “Farmers Union” advertisement promoted\nfor interior use a lead paint made by a company acquired by Fuller. A 1934 advertisement\nplaced by a Monterey hardware store promoted Fuller’s lead paint “for use on interior and\nexterior surfaces.” A 1940 Solano County hardware store advertisement promoted Fuller’s\nlead paint for “interior surfaces.” A 1942 Monterey County paint store advertisement\n                                                  38\n\f       Plaintiff also relied on the LIA’s two promotional campaigns. The member\ncompanies that participated in these campaigns funded them. Fuller was a member of the\nLIA from 1928 to 1958. SWC was a member of the LIA from 1928 to 1947. NL was an\nLIA member from 1928 to 1978. NL and Fuller participated in both of the LIA’s\ncampaigns; SWC participated in only the Forest Products campaign and contributed funds\nto that campaign only from 1937 to 1941.\n       Because the LIA’s promotional campaigns affected multiple defendants, we detail\nthose campaigns at the outset. The Forest Products campaign, which ran from 1934 to\n1941, was aimed at having manufacturers of lumber, window frames, and doors endorse\nlead paint. The purpose of the Forest Products campaign, which was active in California,\nwas to promote the use of lead paint on lumber and in residences. In 1934, the LIA\npersuaded lumber manufacturers associations on the West Coast to recommend the use of\nlead paint on lumber by “enclos[ing] ‘Painting Instructions’ folders with all bundles of\n                   34\nsiding” in 1935.        In 1938, the LIA persuaded the Western Pine Association to paint its\nmodel home at the San Francisco World’s Fair “inside and out with white lead and publicize\nthis specification.” Also in 1938, the LIA persuaded “sash [(window frame)] and door\nmanufacturers” to put labels on 20,000,000 sashes and doors “featuring the use of white\nlead and high-grade prepared paint.” In 1939, the LIA board was apprised that, due to the\nForest Products campaign, “ ‘[a]ll of the principal producers of soft and hard lumber in the\nUnited States such as redwood, cypresses, cedar, pine and others, now specify white lead or\nhigh grade prepared paint which contain white lead.’ ”\n\n\npromoted Fuller’s lead paint for interior use. A 1949 Vallejo paint store advertisement\npromoted Fuller’s lead paint as an “all-purpose house paint.”\n34\n        Plaintiff’s expert testified that these painting instructions included “methods for how\nto use paint on sidings and on floors and on objects in homes . . . .” (Italics added.) The\npainting instructions were not in evidence, and the expert relied solely on an LIA document\nthat referred only to “siding.” The expert also asserted that these instructions pertained to\n“siding interiors,” but he did not explain why the word “siding” would have been used in\nthe 1930s in reference to interior paneling.\n                                                 39\n\f       The LIA’s White Lead Promotion campaign, which ran in two phases, phase one\nfrom 1939 to 1944 and phase two from 1950 through 1952, was intended to increase the\n                         35\nmarket for white lead.        This campaign produced hundreds of advertisements promoting\nwhite lead. LIA advertisements in 1939 and 1940 expressly promoted lead paint for interior\nresidential use. A 1939 LIA advertisement in the Hardware Retailer reproduced a letter to\nthe LIA from the Douglas Fir Plywood Association touting lead paint for interior walls and\nceilings in addition to “exterior siding.” In 1940, LIA advertisements in “National Painters\nMagazine” and “American Painter and Decorator” promoted interior residential use of lead\npaint and proclaimed such things as “white lead lends itself ideally to any paint styling\ndesired by owner or architect, inside or out.” 1940 LIA advertisements in American Paint\nand Oil Dealer, American Painter and Decorator, National Painters Magazine, The Painter\nand Decorator, American Builder, Hardware Retailer, and Hardware Age all promoted lead\npaint for interior residential use.\n       By 1941, the LIA’s campaigns had created a great increase in the sale of lead paint\ncompared to non-lead paint. During the war, lead paint sales declined, and they continued\nto decline after the war. The LIA briefly revived the White Lead Promotion campaign in\nthe early 1950s, but it subsequently stopped specifically promoting white lead paint.\nAlthough the LIA’s campaigns did not reverse the long-term trend of less use of lead\npigments, these campaigns did prolong the use of lead pigments that otherwise probably\n                                  36\nwould have ceased to be used.          More white lead was used during the Depression (the late\n1920s and 1930s) than had been used previously, and the LIA attributed this increase to its\ncampaigns.\n\n\n\n\n35\n        Other LIA advertisements in 1939 and 1940 did not expressly promote lead paint for\ninterior use and mentioned only exterior use.\n36\n      It was unclear whether white lead sales would have declined more quickly if there\nhad been no White Lead Promotion campaign.\n                                                  40\n\f       With this background in mind, we proceed to review defendants’ individual\ncontentions.\n                                            a. ConAgra\n       ConAgra contends that there is not substantial evidence that Fuller promoted lead\npaint for residential interiors with the requisite knowledge because (1) Fuller’s post-1929\nadvertisements did not tell consumers to use lead paint on residential interiors, (2) Fuller’s\npost-1935 advertisements did not mention lead or were only for exterior paint, (3) Fuller did\nnot sell any lead paint for interiors after 1948, and (4) Fuller did not participate in the LIA’s\npromotions.\n       Evidence at trial established that Fuller sold lead paint in the 10 jurisdictions from\n1894 to 1961. Between 1894 and 1948, Fuller marketed two lead products: Pure Prepared\n                                       37\nPaint and Pioneer White Lead in Oil.        Fuller also marketed paints and other coatings that\ndid not contain lead. Fuller’s lead paints were sold at its own stores and by independent\ndealers in all 10 jurisdictions between 1894 and 1961. Plaintiff’s experts testified that\nFuller promoted the use of white lead by distributing brochures for consumers and painters\nthat instructed them to use Fuller’s lead paints for residential interiors and exteriors. They\nalso asserted that Fuller’s advertisements in the 10 jurisdictions instructed consumers to use\nFuller’s white lead paints on their residences.\n       A large number of the advertisements for Fuller products in the record are not for\n                                                               38\nFuller’s lead paint but for other Fuller paints or coatings.        Another group of these\nadvertisements simply generally advertised Fuller paints with no specification of which\nones or without specifying for what purposes, or with specifications of the purposes for each\n\n\n\n37\n       Fuller also owned the Phoenix and Nason paint companies and marketed Phoenix’s\nlead paint.\n38\n       The record contains hundreds of advertisements for Fuller products. Fuller\nadvertised its “Nitrokote,” “Fullerglo,” “Enamel,” and other specific paints, and there was\nno evidence that these paints contained lead.\n                                                 41\n\fpaint that did not suggest that Fuller’s lead paint be used for interiors. Plaintiff’s expert\ntestified: “In my expert opinion, they all are advertising Fuller Paints which contain lead.\nAnd they are actually ads that are informing consumers to use Fuller products without any\nacknowledgment they are containing lead. Some of them have lead in it, some don’t.”\nSince plaintiff’s expert acknowledged that Fuller made both lead paint and non-lead paint,\nthe mere fact that Fuller advertised its products does not establish that it promoted its lead\npaint for interior residential use. We disregard plaintiff’s expert’s testimony on this point\nbecause it lacks any rational basis in the evidence.\n       Many advertisements in the record were for Fuller’s lead paint but did not expressly\nsuggest that it be used for interiors. Some of these advertisements described Fuller’s lead\npaint as “house paint.” However, another group of Fuller advertisements explicitly\npromoted Fuller’s lead paints for “all” residential purposes. For example, a 1927 Monterey\nFuller advertisement promoted Fuller’s lead paint “for all general purposes.” Fuller\nadvertisements in 1937 in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times\ndescribed Fuller’s lead paint as “all purpose, ‘house’ paint.” While these advertisements\nsuggested that Fuller’s lead paint could be used for any purpose, including interior\nresidential use, the most important evidence of Fuller’s promotion of its lead paint for\ninterior residential use was Fuller’s 1931 brochure for its lead paint. This brochure’s\n“Directions for Use” instructed consumers to use this lead paint for residential interiors.\nSince Fuller’s advertisements frequently suggested that consumers obtain brochures from a\nFuller dealer, the brochure’s “Directions for Use” amounted to instructions to all of those\nwho purchased Fuller’s lead paint to use it for residential interiors. Fuller also participated\nin both of the LIA’s promotional campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s, which promoted lead\npaint for interior residential use.\n       This evidence rebuts ConAgra’s contentions. Fuller did promote its lead paint after\n1929 and after 1935, both by instructing consumers to use its lead paint for interior\nresidential use and by participating in the LIA’s campaigns promoting lead paint for interior\n\n                                               42\n\fresidential use. It is immaterial whether Fuller’s advertisements mentioned the word “lead”\nso long as the paint promoted in the advertisement was a lead paint, as it was. Fuller’s\nclaim that it ceased to produce and sell lead paint in 1948 is immaterial even if true. It was\nnot necessary to show that Fuller continued to assist in the creation of the public nuisance\nthroughout the entire period if its conduct constituted a substantial factor in causing the\npublic nuisance (an issue we address in section IV(A)(4) of this opinion). Fuller’s claim\nthat it did not participate in the LIA’s promotions was rebutted by substantial evidence at\ntrial.\n         We conclude that there is substantial evidence that Fuller itself promoted its lead\npaint for interior residential use at least beginning in 1931 and that it continued to do so as\npart of the LIA’s promotional campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s. Since the evidence\nsupports the trial court’s finding that Fuller knew of the danger that such use would create\nfor children at that time, there is substantial evidence that Fuller promoted lead paint for\ninterior residential use with the requisite knowledge.\n                                             b. NL\n         NL contends that its advertisements were not misleading because they merely\ndescribed how well lead paint would protect and beautify interior walls and woodwork. As\nwe have already explained, promotion of lead paint for interior residential use was\ninherently misleading because it implicitly asserted that it was safe for such use when it was\nnot. NL also asserts that the court’s promotion finding cannot be upheld because there was\nno evidence that NL promoted lead paint for interior residential use after 1950. As we have\nnoted above, the period during which a defendant assisted in the creation of a public\nnuisance is relevant only as to causation; it does not rebut a showing of affirmative\npromotion with the requisite knowledge.\n         Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that NL affirmatively promoted\nlead paint for interior residential use with the requisite knowledge. NL stipulated that it\nmanufactured, sold, and promoted lead paint for residential use in the 10 jurisdictions from\n\n                                                43\n\f1900 to 1972 and that its “White Lead-in-Oil,” “Dutch Boy House Paint 104,” “Dutch Boy\nHouse Paint 111,” and “Dutch Boy House Paint 116” contained white lead. No evidence\n                                                                               39\nwas produced at trial that any other NL paint products contained white lead.\n       Plaintiff’s expert testified that NL promoted its Dutch Boy lead paint for interior\nresidential use. NL produced “little illustrated books [in which] children were provided\nwith both a story and a coloring pallet of paint that basically depicted the ways in which\nDutch Boy white lead paint protected children from all sorts of onslaughts.” He testified\nthat NL “[s]pecifically promoted the use” of lead paint in “play rooms, . . . homes and on to\nsurfaces and even on their furniture.” Plaintiff’s expert also noted that NL’s advertisements\ndid not necessarily disclose whether NL’s lead paint contained lead and did not always\ndistinguish between the use of lead paint on interiors and its use on exteriors. As we will\nexplain, the material upon which plaintiff’s expert based his testimony provides substantial\nsupport for his testimony.\n       NL’s advertisements from the early 20th century demonstrate that NL repeatedly\npromoted its lead paint for interior residential use. A 1915 NL advertisement in the San\nFrancisco Chronicle did so. A 1924 NL advertisement in National Geographic Magazine\ndid so. A 1929 NL advertisement in the Los Angeles Times did so. 1929 NL\nadvertisements in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune promoted lead\n\n\n39\n        Many of the advertisements in the record were for Bass-Hueter products. NL\npurchased Bass-Hueter Paint Company in 1916, and Bass-Hueter merged with NL in 1930.\nNo evidence was produced at trial that any specific Bass-Hueter paints contained white\nlead. Although the record contains 1931 advertisements for Bass-Hueter paints that\npromoted interior residential use, there is no evidence that those paints were lead paints. A\n1933 Santa Clara County hardware store advertisement promoted Bass-Heuter Pure Lead\nand Oil Paint, but it did not suggest that it be used for residential interiors. Although Bass-\nHeuter advertisements in 1922 in Solano County and in 1925 in Santa Clara County\ndescribed Bass-Heuter paints as having “permanent pigments, a base consisting of a\ncombination of pure carbonate of lead and oxide of zinc, ground in refined linseed oil,”\nthere is no indication that these advertisements were admitted or could properly be admitted\nfor their truth. Accordingly, the Bass-Hueter advertisements do not establish that NL\npromoted lead paint for interior residential use.\n                                              44\n\fpaint for “your stucco house or for any other surface.” (Italics added.) A 1938 San Diego\nadvertisement by a paint store promoted Dutch Boy, NL’s brand, as “All Purpose Lead.” A\n1950 San Diego advertisement by a paint store promoted NL’s lead products for interior\nresidential use. And NL participated in both of the LIA’s promotional campaigns in the\n1930s and 1940s promoting lead paint for interior residential use.\n       NL’s 1929 “paint book” for children showed a “Dutch Boy Painter” who tells the\nchildren, “This famous Dutch Boy Lead of mine [¶] Can make this playroom fairly shine\n[¶] Let’s start our painting right away [¶] You’ll find the work is only play.” The book\nshowed children stirring and painting with clearly labeled containers of Dutch Boy White\nLead paint and then playing in their newly painted playroom. At the end of the book, it\nsaid: “For durable economical paint—inside or outside [¶] Paint with lead [¶] Dutch Boy\nWhite-Lead.” Every page of the “paint book” instructed children to give their parents the\n                                      40\n“coupon” in the middle of the book.        NL’s paint book contained “paper chips of paint” for\nchildren to use to color the pictures in the book. NL used this paint book as a promotion\n“for many years.” This paint book obviously promoted lead paint for interior residential\nuse.\n       NL’s 1949 salesman’s manual instructed NL’s salesmen that NL’s lead paints could\n“handle any painting job, exterior or interior” on any building. The manual told the\nsalesmen that NL’s “Lead Mixing Oil” was appropriate for “interior surfaces.”\n       NL’s 1950 “Handbook on Painting” encouraged the use of white lead paint on\ninterior surfaces: “On interiors white lead is desired for its unique richness and solid beauty\nof finish. Also, the durability of white lead paint enables it to stand up under frequent\nwashing—a big money saver in such places as hospitals and hotels.” “The customary flat\npaint for interior work is made by mixing white lead with either Lead Mixing Oil or flatting\n\n\n\n40\n      In NL’s 1949 salesman’s manual, NL noted that the “paint book” was one of its\n“most successful promotions” of its paint.\n                                                45\n\foil.” “Dutch Boy Lead Mixing Oil, when mixed with white lead in the proper proportions,\nmakes flat paint that can be used on exterior as well as interior surfaces.” “Furthermore,\nwhite lead and Lead Mixing Oil has the sturdy wear and beauty of finish characteristic of all\nwhite lead paint, whether exposed to weather or used inside. [¶] White lead and Lead\nMixing Oil can be used for all coats on plaster and wallboard.” NL’s instructions for use in\nthis handbook explicitly advocated the use of lead paint on interiors.\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that NL affirmatively promoted\nlead paint for interior residential use with the requisite knowledge. NL extensively\npromoted its lead paint for interior residential use from 1915 through 1950. Because NL\nknew of the danger to children from lead paint on residential interiors no later than 1914,\nsubstantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that NL’s subsequent promotions of\nlead paint for such use were done with the requisite knowledge.\n                                           c. SWC\n       SWC contends that plaintiff did not present evidence of any advertisement by SWC\npromoting lead paint for interior residential use.\n       SWC stipulated that it began manufacturing lead paint in 1880 and began\nmanufacturing white lead carbonate pigment in 1910. SWC manufactured Old Dutch\nProcess (ODP) white lead in oil from 1910 to 1947. SWC manufactured “Inside Floor\nPaint,” some colors of which contained white lead, between 1910 and 1913. SWC’s other\nwhite lead paints were some of its SWP “house paint” colors until 1950, some of its\n                                    41\n“Family Paint” colors in the 1940s, its “Porch and Deck” paint, and its “Concrete &\n\n\n\n41\n       SWC and plaintiff stipulated that there was “no evidence” that SWC’s “Family\nPaint,” a paint that was intended for and promoted for interior residential use, “ever\ncontained white lead sulfate” or “ever contained white lead carbonate pigment prior to\n1941.” Interestingly, SWC’s 1926 training manual for its representatives stated that Family\nPaint, which it stated “will give good service on inside work,” contained “White Lead\nSulfate” pigment. SWC and plaintiff also stipulated that they had discovered no post-1936\nadvertisements for SWC’s Family Paint.\n                                              46\n\f                 42\nStucco” paint.        SWC also sold Monarch House Paint, ACME Quality House Paint, and\nLowe Brothers High Standard House Paint, which were all lead paints. In a 1934\npromotional booklet, SWC proclaimed that it was the “world’s largest paint producer” and\n“one of the country’s largest producers of White Lead.”\n       SWC promoted and sold its white lead products for residential use in the 10\njurisdictions. The primary message conveyed in advertisements for SWC’s paints, Monarch\npaints, and ACME’s paints was that there was a specific coating for each purpose and that it\nwas important to get the right coating for each type of use. For example, a 1903 SWC\nadvertisement read: “No matter what you want to paint, . . . you’ll get best results and save\nmoney if you use [¶] THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS PAINTS [¶] A special paint for each\npurpose.” A large group of SWC advertisements simply generically advertised SWC’s\nbrand, without specifying any particular paints. Many SWC advertisements were for\nSWC’s non-lead “Kemtone” paint.\n       Advertisements for SWC’s SWP House Paint often specified that it was for exterior\nuse. Others simply referred to SWP as “house paint” without mentioning interior use. Still\nothers identified SWP as being for “wood surfaces” or for all “woodwork” surfaces.\nHowever, there were also advertisements promoting SWP for interior residential use. 1904\nSWC advertisements in the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union promoted SWP\n\n\n\n\n       In view of the parties’ stipulations, we are required to disregard evidence that SWC’s\nFamily Paint was promoted for interior residential use prior to 1941. 1901 and 1904\nadvertisements in the Los Angeles Times promoted SWC Family Paint for interior use. A\n1923 SWC advertisement in the San Francisco Examiner promoted SWC’s Family Paint as\n“an all-round paint for inside use.” A 1926 advertisement in the Oakland Tribune promoted\nSWC Family Paint as a “household paint.”\n42\n       For instance, SWC’s SWP Mildew Resisting White paint contained lead prior to\n1954. Some of the colors in SWC’s SWP Colors contained lead until 1950. In 1938, SWC\nalso sold a lead paint called Zilo.\n                                               47\n\f                    43\nfor “inside” use.        In addition, SWC participated in the LIA’s Forest Products campaign\nfrom 1937 to 1941, which promoted lead paint for interior residential use and particularly\nfor use on doors and window frames.\n       SWC had the requisite knowledge in 1900 of the public health hazard posed by lead\npaint, but it nevertheless continued to promote lead paint for interior residential use\nthereafter. This evidence supports the trial court’s finding that SWC engaged in the\nrequisite wrongful promotion.\n                                            4. Causation\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff did not produce substantial evidence that their\npromotions of lead paint for interior residential use were a substantial factor in causing the\nnuisance that the trial court required them to abate. First, they contend that there was no\nevidence that their promotions actually had an impact on the use of lead paint on residential\ninteriors. Second, they contend that their wrongful promotions were too remote from the\ncurrent presence of any public health hazard created by interior residential lead paint,\nwhich, they claim, is largely due to owner neglect, renovations, intervening actors\n(architects, painters, etc.), and repainting that has taken place in the interim. Third, they\nargue that, because they did not promote lead paint for interior residential use after 1950,\nthey could not be held responsible for use of lead paint on residential interiors of homes\nbuilt after 1950. The trial court’s judgment required defendants to remediate interior lead\npaint in all homes built before 1980, even though most of those homes were built after\n1950. Fourth, they maintain that there was no evidence that their promotions of lead paint\n\n\n\n43\n        Although many of the advertisements for SWC paints were placed by hardware\nstores or other retailers, SWC paid half of the cost of advertising by its authorized dealers,\nso these advertisements may properly be attributed to SWC. A 1924 lumber store\nadvertisement in Monterey for Monarch lead paint suggested that it could be used for\ninteriors. However, the stipulation between SWC and plaintiff was that this paint contained\nlead between 1925 and 1930, which does not include 1924 when this advertisement was\nplaced.\n                                                 48\n\ffor interior residential use had a causal connection to the water leaks and soil lead that the\ncourt ordered them to remediate. Fifth, defendants claim that plaintiff was required to show\nthat their individual lead paints are currently present in a large number of homes in the 10\njurisdictions. Sixth, they argue that due process requires that their liability for remediation\nbe proportionate to their individual contributions.\n       Causation is an element of a cause of action for public nuisance. (Melton v. Boustred\n(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 521, 542.) “A connecting element to the prohibited harm must be\nshown.” (In re Firearm Cases (2005) 126 Cal.App.4th 959, 988 (Firearm Cases).) The\nparties agree that the causation element of a public nuisance cause of action is satisfied if\nthe conduct of a defendant is a substantial factor in bringing about the result. (Citizens for\nOdor Nuisance Abatement v. City of San Diego (2017) 8 Cal.App.5th 350, 359 [applying\nsubstantial factor standard in a public nuisance action].) “ ‘The substantial factor standard is\na relatively broad one, requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more\nthan negligible or theoretical.’ [Citation.] Thus, ‘a force which plays only an\n“infinitesimal” or “theoretical” part in bringing about injury, damage, or loss is not a\nsubstantial factor’ [citation], but a very minor force that does cause harm is a substantial\nfactor [citation].” (Bockrath v. Aldrich Chemical Co., Inc. (1999) 21 Cal.4th 71, 79.)\n                                 a. Impact and Remoteness\n       In this case, there was plenty of evidence that defendants’ affirmative promotions of\nlead paint for interior residential use played at least a “minor” role in creating the nuisance\nthat now exists.\n       First, all three defendants participated in the LIA’s Forest Products campaign. The\nForest Products campaign began in 1934. In 1935, the LIA reported that its Forest Products\ncampaign had resulted in some manufacturers of leadless paints “changing their formulas to\ninclude lead.” In 1939, the LIA reported to its members that, as a result of the Forest\nProducts campaign, (1) “[a]ll the principal producers of soft and hard lumber in the United\nStates . . . specify white lead or high grade prepared paint which contains white lead”\n\n                                               49\n\fthrough the “distributi[on of] painting instruction leaflets (2,000,000 copies)”; (2) “[s]ome\npaint companies have increased the lead content of their paint”; and (3) “sash and door\nmanufacturers” would be producing “20,000,000 labels to be affixed to nearly all the sash\nand doors in the United States, featuring the use of white lead and high-grade prepared\npaint.” In 1941, the LIA reported that the benefits of the Forest Products campaign were\ncontinuing. “Lumber associations continued distributing, at their own expense, thousands\nof painting leaflets recommending white lead or the highest grade prepared paints to be used\non their products” and that the “National Door Manufacturing Association” was “the latest\nto use painting leaflets” to promote the use of white lead. The lumber manufacturers were\ncontinuing to include “painting instruction leaflets” with their lumber products. Since lead\npaint on doors and windows is one of the most hazardous uses for children due to the dust\ncreated by their friction surfaces, this campaign played a significant role in creating the\nnuisance that now exists.\n       Second, both NL and Fuller gave consumers of their lead paints explicit instructions\nto use those paints on residential interiors. Fuller’s 1931 brochure for its lead paint\ncontained “Directions for Use” instructing consumers to use this lead paint for residential\ninteriors. Since Fuller’s advertisements frequently suggested that consumers obtain\nbrochures from a Fuller dealer, the brochure’s “Directions for Use” constituted instructions\nto all those who purchased Fuller’s lead paint to use it for residential interiors. NL\nproduced its 1929 paint book, which promoted lead paint for interior residential use, and NL\npublished its 1950 “Handbook on Painting,” which explicitly recommended that consumers\nuse white lead paint on interior surfaces.\n       In sum, by persuading window and door manufacturers to attach written\nrecommendations to all windows and doors that lead paint should be used on those windows\nand doors, all three defendants certainly played a significant role in causing lead paint to be\nused on at least some of those windows and doors. Further, NL and Fuller, by explicitly\ninstructing consumers to use their lead paints on residential interiors, played an even more\n\n                                               50\n\fdirect role in causing lead paint to be used in such a manner. Again, the trial court could\nreasonably infer that at least some of those who were the targets of these recommendations\nheeded them. That is all that the substantial factor test requires.\n        We cannot credit defendants’ claim that there was no evidence that their promotions\nwere even “a very minor force”—“a substantial factor”—in causing the presence of lead\npaint on residential interiors in the 10 jurisdictions. The LIA’s extensive advertising\ncampaigns, in which all three defendants participated, affirmatively promoted to painters,\narchitects, retailers, and consumers the use of lead paint on residential interiors, and each\ndefendant also individually promoted to consumers lead paint for use on residential interiors\nin the 10 jurisdictions. The LIA judged its promotional campaigns to be a success, and the\nfact that lead paint remains in place on residential interiors in many homes throughout the\n10 jurisdictions decades after all of these promotions ceased reflects that this belief was\naccurate. We find reasonable the inference that each individual defendant’s promotion of\nlead paint for interior residential use, both through the LIA promotional campaigns and their\nindividual promotions, were at least “a very minor force” in leading to the current presence\nof interior residential lead paint in a substantial number of homes in the 10 jurisdictions.\n        Defendants also contend that their wrongful promotions were too remote from the\ncurrent hazard to be its “legal cause.” They claim that, due to the lapse of time, this hazard\nis more closely attributable to owner neglect, renovations, painters, architects, and\nrepainting. “A tort is a legal cause of injury only when it is a substantial factor in producing\nthe injury.” (Soule v. General Motors Corp. (1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 572.) “ ‘ “ ‘Legal cause’\nexists if the actor’s conduct is a ‘substantial factor’ in bringing about the harm and there is\nno rule of law relieving the actor from liability. [Citations.]” ’ [Citations.] ‘ “The doctrine of\nproximate cause limits liability; i.e., in certain situations where the defendant’s conduct is\nan actual cause of the harm, he will nevertheless be absolved because of the manner in\nwhich the injury occurred.” ’ ” (Lombardo v. Huysentruyt (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 656, 665-\n666.)\n\n                                               51\n\f       “ ‘Proximate cause involves two elements.’ [Citation.] ‘One is cause in fact. An act\nis a cause in fact if it is a necessary antecedent of an event.’ [Citation.] . . . [¶] By contrast,\nthe second element focuses on public policy considerations. Because the purported causes\nof an event may be traced back to the dawn of humanity, the law has imposed additional\n‘limitations on liability other than simple causality.’ [Citation.] ‘These additional\nlimitations are related not only to the degree of connection between the conduct and the\ninjury, but also with public policy.’ [Citation.] Thus, ‘proximate cause’ “is ordinarily\nconcerned, not with the fact of causation, but with the various considerations of policy that\nlimit an actor’s responsibility for the consequences of his conduct.” ’ ” (Ferguson v. Lieff,\nCabraser, Heimann & Bernstein (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1037, 1045.) “[T]here is no bright line\ndemarcating a legally sufficient proximate cause from one that is too remote. Ordinarily the\nquestion will be for the [factfinder], though in some instances undisputed evidence may\nreveal a cause so remote that a court may properly decide that no rational trier of fact could\nfind the needed nexus.” (People v. Roberts (1992) 2 Cal.4th 271, 320, fn. 11.)\n       Defendants argue that they should be absolved of responsibility for the current\nhazard because their wrongful conduct was “too remote” and “attenuated” from the current\n          44\nhazard.        This was a question of fact for the trial court. A rational factfinder could have\nconcluded that defendants’ wrongful promotions of lead paint for interior residential use\nwere not unduly remote from the presence of interior residential lead paint placed on those\nresidences during the period of defendants’ wrongful promotions and within a reasonable\nperiod thereafter. The connection between the long-ago promotions and the current\n\n\n\n44\n       The cases that defendants rely on provide no support for their argument. For\ninstance, the portion of Cabral v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2011) 51 Cal.4th 764 (Cabral) that\nthey cite concerned a duty determination, not a causation determination. (Cabral, at\np. 779.) The firearm manufacturers in Firearm Cases, supra, 126 Cal.App.4th 959, unlike\ndefendants, did not affirmatively promote their products for a dangerous use. (Firearm\nCases, at pp. 988-989.) City of Chicago v. American Cyanamid Co. (Ill. App. Ct. 2005) 355\nIll.App.3d 209 was decided under Illinois law.\n                                                   52\n\fpresence of lead paint was not particularly attenuated. Those who were influenced by the\npromotions to use lead paint on residential interiors in the 10 jurisdictions were the single\nconduit between defendants’ actions and the current hazard. Under these circumstances, the\ntrial court could have reasonably concluded that defendants’ promotions, which were a\nsubstantial factor in creating the current hazard, were not too remote to be considered a\nlegal cause of the current hazard even if the actions of others in response to those\npromotions and the passive neglect of owners also played a causal role. The court could\ntherefore have concluded that defendants’ promotions were the “legal cause” of the current\nnuisance.\n                                     b. Post-1950 Homes\n       We find merit in defendants’ claim that the record lacks substantial evidence to\nsupport the court’s finding that their wrongful promotions were causally connected to post-\n1950 homes containing interior lead paint built before 1980.\n       Plaintiff claims that defendants’ wrongful promotions “sustained, increased, and\nprolonged the use of lead paint in homes throughout the 20th century.” (Italics added.) It\nasserts that this can be “inferred” from the “sheer breadth of Defendants’ promotional\nactivities” and the fact that there is currently lead paint in homes in the 10 jurisdictions.\nPlaintiff also claims that NL continued to promote lead paint for interior residential use\nbeyond 1950.\n       First of all, plaintiff did not produce any evidence of an affirmative promotion by\nNL, SWC, or Fuller of lead paint for interior residential use after 1950. The advertisements\nthat plaintiff identifies as post-1950 NL promotions did not promote lead paint for interior\nresidential use. Those advertisements promoted NL’s “Dutch Boy” brand of paints and\nidentified interior residential use as one of the uses for NL’s “Dutch Boy” brand of paints\nwithout suggesting that any lead paint be used for interiors. NL stipulated at trial that its\n“White Lead-in-Oil” and three of its “Dutch Boy” paints contained white lead, and plaintiff\npresented no evidence that any other NL paint product contained lead. Since NL\n\n                                               53\n\findisputably made many Dutch Boy paints, NL’s promotion of its brand for many uses,\nincluding interior residential use, did not amount to an affirmative promotion of lead paint\nfor interior residential use. Indeed, plaintiff’s argument seems to be based on the idea that\nthe mere fact that these advertisements identified National Lead Company as the maker of\nDutch Boy paints transformed advertisements for non-lead paints for interior use into\npromotions of lead paint for interior use. We reject this unfounded argument.\n       NL contends that the evidence could not support a finding that it caused the use of\nlead paint on residential interiors after 1955 because, according to NL, all lead paint bore a\nlabel marking it as not for interior residential use beginning in 1955. The only citation to\nthe record that NL provides is to testimony by a defense expert about a standard created by\nthe American Standards Association in 1955. The expert testified that the LIA had\nparticipated in the creation of that standard. He referenced a defense exhibit, a barely\nlegible copy of which appears in the record, that apparently contains the 1955 standard.\nThis standard states: “These specifications cover the requirements for coatings (such as\npaints, enamels, lacquers, etc. applied in liquid form) which are deemed suitable from a\nhealth standpoint to be used to paint children’s toys or furniture or interior surfaces so that\nthe danger of poisoning will be minimized if, by chance, some of this coating should be\nchewed off and swallowed by a child.” “A liquid coating material to be deemed suitable,\nfrom a health standpoint, for use on articles such as furniture, toys, etc, or for interior use in\ndwelling units where it might be chewed by children” should not contain more than\n1 percent lead. The standard states that coatings complying with it “may be marked:\n‘Conforms to American Standard Z66.1-1955, for use on surfaces that might be chewed by\nchildren.” Notably, this standard does not impose any labeling requirement of any kind on\nlead paint.\n       Although one might draw an inference that the LIA’s participation in the creation of\nthis standard encouraged the compliance of its members, the trial court was not required to\ndraw that inference. Indeed, the standard itself stated: “The existence of an American\n\n                                                54\n\fStandard does not in any respect preclude any party who has approved of the standard from\nmanufacturing, selling, or using products . . . not conforming to the standard.” Moreover,\nthis standard did not even suggest a label for lead paint. It pertained to a label for non-lead\npaints. Nor is there any affirmative evidence in the record that even this standard was\nenforced by anyone or that any defendant complied with it beginning in 1955.\n       Nevertheless, plaintiff’s assertion that the current presence of lead paint on\nresidential interiors itself establishes that defendants’ pre-1951 promotions caused it to be\nplaced there is speculative and attempts to eliminate the causation element entirely. While\nwe can accept the inference that defendants’ pre-1951 promotions increased the use of lead\npaint on residential interiors during the period of those promotions, we reject plaintiff’s\nclaim that it is a reasonable inference that the impact of those promotions may be assumed\nto have continued for the next 30 years. We can find no evidence in the record that supports\nan inference that the promotions of defendants prior to 1951 continued to cause the use of\n                                                     45\nlead paint on residential interiors decades later.        We therefore conclude that we cannot\nuphold the trial court’s judgment requiring defendants to remediate all houses built before\n                                                                                              46\n1981 because there is no evidence to support causation as to the homes built after 1950.\n                                c. Water Leaks and Soil Lead\n       Defendants also challenge on causation grounds the court’s inclusion of soil lead and\nwater leaks in its remediation plan.\n\n\n45\n       ConAgra contends that the court erred in treating homes built before 1981 as an\n“indivisible group.” We do not believe that the court treated these homes as an indivisible\ngroup. The court’s remediation plan explicitly assigned homes built before 1950 to the\nhighest priority, while homes built from 1950 to 1981 were assigned a lower priority. Since\nthe age of a home is generally discoverable, homes may be readily distinguished from one\nanother based on the date they were built. Indeed, by limiting the remediation plan to\nhomes built before 1981, the court’s remediation plan already treated homes differently\nbased on their age.\n46\n      On remand, the trial court will need to recalculate the amount of the abatement fund\naccordingly.\n                                               55\n\f       This was a disputed issue at trial. Plaintiff’s experts testified: “[L]ead paint gets into\nthe soil from several routes. One is by the friction and impact surfaces, opening and closing\nwindows and doors on a home with lead-based paint. It also results from the weathering of\npaint exterior on the home, rain and sun hits the paint, it deteriorates over time. And also\nprevious paint jobs, generally where they are sanding and scraping have contributed to soil\nlead contamination around the home.” Lead concentrations are highest close to the home\n“[b]ecause we know that the exterior is subject to weathering, because windows on the\nexterior often have high lead concentrations and they are subject to friction and impact, and\nbecause the previous painting jobs could have caused sanding and scraping on the exterior\n                                                                                          47\nof a home which often then resides as contamination of the soil close to the home.”\n“[L]ead-based paint in housing now is the major source of contamination of both soil and\n               48\nhouse dust.”        Thus, plaintiff’s evidence established that a prime contributor to soil lead\nwas lead paint on the friction surfaces of windows and doors, which are interior, rather than\nexterior surfaces. In keeping with this evidence, the judgment requires remediation of soil\nlead only where the home itself contains interior lead paint. Under these circumstances, the\nevidence supports the court’s implied finding that soil lead in those homes has been caused\nby interior residential use of lead paint.\n       The court’s decision to include remediation of water leaks in the judgment is not a\ncausation issue. Plaintiff did not contend that the water leaks should be remediated because\nthey were caused by defendants’ promotions. The reason why remediation of water leaks is\n\n\n\n47\n        One of plaintiff’s experts responded to the question “What are sources of lead in dust\nin [sic] soil, other than -- your view is that the sources for dust and soil lead are lead-based\npaint; right?” by saying “Sure. Where leaded paints are available. I mean in the housing\nunit.” This response does not necessarily attribute soil lead to interior lead paint as the\nquestion referred to both soil lead and household dust lead.\n48\n       He also testified that “lead in housing” consisted of “lead paint, lead dust in housing,\nand lead in soil.” Plaintiff’s expert testified that soil lead and dust lead inside houses are\nlinked because “the soil is often tracked into the home on people’s shoes.”\n                                                  56\n\fproperly part of the remediation plan is that the court did not order remediation of all\ninterior lead paint. As water leaks could cause intact interior lead paint to deteriorate and\npresent a dangerous hazard to children, the remediation of water leaks was an appropriate\nlesser alternative to removal of all interior lead paint. Since defendants’ wrongful\npromotions caused the presence of interior lead paint, the court did not err in requiring\nremediation designed to prevent that interior lead paint from harming children in those\nhomes.\n                            d. Identification of Individual Paint\n       Defendants contend that their promotions cannot be found to have caused the\npresence of interior lead paint in homes in the 10 jurisdictions without proof that paint made\nby each of them is currently present in those homes. This contention misconstrues the basis\nfor defendants’ liability. Defendants are liable for promoting lead paint for interior\nresidential use. To the extent that this promotion caused lead paint to be used on residential\ninteriors, the identity of the manufacturer of that lead paint is irrelevant. Indeed, the LIA’s\npromotions did not refer to any manufacturer of lead paint, but were generic. What matters\nis whether defendants’ promotions were a substantial factor in leading to the use of lead\npaint on residential interiors. Substantial evidence supports the court’s causation finding on\nthat basis.\n                                  e. Proportioned Liability\n       Defendants’ final challenge to the court’s causation finding is based on their claim\nthat they could not be held liable except in proportion to their individual contributions to the\ncreation of the public nuisance. They claim that due process precluded the imposition of a\nremedy that was “grossly disproportionate to a defendant’s conduct.”\n       None of the cases they cite concerns causation in a public nuisance case.\nProportionality is not a causation issue. Defendants may be held liable for a public nuisance\nthat they assisted in creating if their wrongful promotions were a substantial factor in the\ncreation of that public nuisance. As we have already concluded, the evidence supports the\n\n                                               57\n\ftrial court’s finding at least as to homes built before 1951. Proportionate liability is\nsomething that defendants may be able to determine by means of litigation between\nthemselves, but the fact that the remediation plan does not apportion liability among\ndefendants does not infect the court’s causation finding.\n       Citing the Restatement, defendants argue that “a defendant can be liable only for its\nown contribution to a nuisance.” However, the Restatement comment upon which they rely\ndoes not support their contention. It says: “[T]he burden rests upon the defendant to\nproduce sufficient evidence to permit the apportionment to be made. [¶] When the\napportionment is made, each person contributing to the nuisance is subject to liability only\nfor his own contribution. He is not liable for that of others; but the fact that the others are\ncontributing is not a defense to his own liability.” (Rest.2d Torts, § 840E, com. B, italics\nadded.) The trial court could have reasonably concluded that defendants did not prove that\nthe harm was capable of apportionment. The Restatement confirms that where the harm is\nnot capable of apportionment, each contributor is liable for the entire harm. (Rest.2d Torts,\n§ 840E, com. c.) In this case, it is clear that the trial court properly concluded that the harm\nwas incapable of apportionment and therefore held all three defendants jointly and severally\nliable for the entire harm.\n                5. Abatability, Imminent Danger, and Reduction of BLLs\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to prove that defendants have the ability to\nabate lead in private homes or that abatement can be achieved “at a reasonable cost by\nreasonable means.”\n       This court rejected defendants’ “ability to abate” contention in Santa Clara I.\n“ ‘[L]iability for nuisance does not hinge on whether the defendant owns, possesses or\ncontrols the property, nor on whether he is in a position to abate the nuisance; the critical\n\n\n\n\n                                               58\n\fquestion is whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance.’ ”\n                                                                                               49\n(Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 306.) We decline to reconsider this issue.\n       Defendants’ “reasonable cost” contention is premised on Mangini v. Aerojet-General\nCorp. (1996) 12 Cal.4th 1087 (Mangini II). The issue in Mangini II concerned the statute of\nlimitations. (Mangini II, at p. 1090.) Because the plaintiffs had not filed their private\nnuisance action within the three-year limitations period for a “permanent” nuisance, the\naction was barred unless the nuisance was a “continuing” one. (Ibid.) “ ‘[T]he crucial test\nof the permanency of a trespass or nuisance is whether the trespass or nuisance can be\ndiscontinued or abated.’ ” (Mangini II, at p. 1097.) The California Supreme Court held that\nthe plaintiffs had failed to prove that the nuisance was abatable. However, the court\nexpressly denied that its holding would be applicable where the statute of limitations was\nnot at issue: “We express no opinion on the question whether a plaintiff who has filed a\ntimely nuisance action is required to prove that abatement can be accomplished at a\n‘reasonable cost’ in order to be entitled to an injunction requiring the wrongdoing party to\nremedy the damage to the property.” (Mangini II, at p. 1090.) Defendants choose to ignore\n                                                                                          50\nthis statement, but it establishes that Mangini II provides no support for their claim.\n       Defendants’ reliance on County of San Diego v. Carlstrom (1961) 196 Cal.App.2d\n485 (Carlstrom) is also misplaced. Carlstrom was a case in which the defendants claimed\nthat the abatement injunction should have offered them abatement options other than\nremoval of the structures that the court had found to be a public nuisance. (Carlstrom, at\n\n\n\n49\n       The Rhode Island and New Jersey cases upon which defendants rely are not helpful\nas these cases did not apply California law. (State v. Lead Industries Ass’n, Inc. (R.I. 2008)\n951 A.2d 428; In re Lead Paint Litigation ([June 15,] 2007) 191 N.J. 405.) We discuss\nthese out-of-state cases in section V of this opinion.\n50\n       Beck Development Co. v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. (1996) 44\nCal.App.4th 1160 (Beck), like Mangini II, discussed abatability solely in the context of\nwhether a private nuisance cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. (Beck, at\npp. 1216, 1219-1223.)\n                                              59\n\fp. 493.) The Court of Appeal found that the trial court had not abused its discretion in\nrequiring removal. (Ibid.) We can find nothing in Carlstrom to support defendants’\nabatability or reasonable cost contentions.\n       Defendants assert that plaintiff failed to establish that lead paint poses an imminent\ndanger of harm and that the abatement plan will reduce children’s BLLs. Plaintiff responds\nthat it presented substantial evidence that lead paint poses an imminent risk of harm and that\nabatement, and particularly door and window replacement, will reduce the number of\nchildren who are poisoned by lead paint.\n       Defendants rely on Helix Land Co. v. City of San Diego (1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 932\n(Helix) to support their claim that plaintiff failed to prove that lead paint poses an imminent\ndanger of harm. The plaintiff in Helix attempted to allege inverse condemnation and\nnuisance causes of action based on its claim that its land was at greater risk of harm due to\nthe City’s actions and inactions regarding flood control. (Helix, at pp. 940, 950.) However,\nthe plaintiff failed to allege that the City’s actions “present[] a future hazard” to its land.\n(Helix, at p. 950.) The plaintiff did not allege that any damage had occurred, and the court\nfound that it was mere speculation that damage might occur in the future. (Ibid.) The court\nrejected the plaintiff’s nuisance cause of action on the ground that it had failed to allege that\na “prospective nuisance” was “either probable or imminent.” (Helix, at p. 951.)\n       Helix does not support defendants’ challenge to the trial court’s abatement order. In\nthis case, unlike in Helix, there was substantial evidence that interior residential lead paint\n                                                                                          51\nhad been causing and will continue to cause harm to children in the 10 jurisdictions.\n“Almost all human activity involves some risk, and in circumstances in which Civil Code\nsection 3479 is the only applicable statute, considerable judicial discretion has been allowed\nin determining whether an alleged danger is sufficiently serious to justify abatement.” (City\n\n\n\n51\n       They also cite Beck, but in Beck, unlike this case, there was “no evidence” of\npotential harm from the alleged public nuisance. (Beck, supra, 44 Cal.App.4th at p. 1214.)\n                                                60\n\fof Bakersfield v. Miller (1966) 64 Cal.2d 93, 99 (Miller).) Every year, numerous children in\nthe 10 jurisdictions are found to be suffering from lead poisoning due to their exposure to\nlead paint. “[T]he lead will not disappear on its own.” So long as interior residential lead\npaint continues to exist in the 10 jurisdictions, this nuisance will continue to be an ongoing\nand imminent risk to the health of the children in the 10 jurisdictions. The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining that the danger posed by interior residential lead paint in\nthe 10 jurisdictions poses a sufficiently serious and imminent risk of harm to merit\nabatement.\n       Defendants also contend that abatement is unwarranted because plaintiff failed to\nshow that abatement will reduce the BLLs of children in the 10 jurisdictions. Plaintiff\npresented expert testimony that abatement is effective at reducing BLLs in children.\nDefendants concede that plaintiff presented such evidence, but they maintain that this expert\n                                                   52\nopinion testimony was “inadmissible guesswork.”         The trial court admitted this evidence,\nand defendants make no effort to demonstrate that the court abused its broad discretion in\ndoing so. Their citation to Sargon Enterprises, Inc. v. University of Southern California\n(2012) 55 Cal.4th 747 (Sargon) is not helpful to their contention. Sargon held that the trial\ncourt has discretion as a “gatekeeper” to determine “whether the matter relied on [by an\nexpert] can provide a reasonable basis for the opinion or whether that opinion is based on a\nleap of logic or conjecture.” (Sargon, at pp. 771-772.) Defendants fail to establish that the\ntrial court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiff’s expert’s opinion regarding BLL\n\n\n52\n       Defendants repeatedly insist that the court ordered abatement of “intact” lead paint.\nThis insistence is misleading. With the exception of doors and windows, intact lead paint\non large surfaces such as walls would not be removed. Instead, paint stabilization\ntechniques would be applied to ensure that it remained intact. Lead-contaminated soil\nwould be covered or removed depending on its concentration. Windows and doors that had\nbeen painted with lead paint would be replaced, as no other remediation would be effective.\nThus, the court did not order abatement of all “intact” lead paint in the 10 jurisdictions. The\nabatement plan targeted only the highest risks, while avoiding the creation of additional\nrisks of contamination that might follow from the removal of all intact lead paint.\n                                              61\n\freductions had a reasonable basis. Since the evidence was properly admitted, the trial court\nwas entitled to credit it. The substance of defendants’ argument is that the trial court should\nnot have credited this testimony, but an appellate court must defer to a trial court’s\ncredibility determinations. We reject this contention.\n\n\n                                           B. Public Right\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to establish that interior residential lead paint\n                                      53\ninterferes with any “public right.”\n       “ ‘Anything which is injurious to health . . . or is indecent or offensive to the senses,\nor an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable\nenjoyment of life or property . . . is a nuisance.’ (Civ. Code, § 3479, italics added.) ‘A\npublic nuisance is one which affects at the same time an entire community or neighborhood,\nor any considerable number of persons, although the extent of the annoyance or damage\ninflicted upon individuals may be unequal.’ (Civ. Code, § 3480[, italics added].) . . . [¶]\n‘[P]ublic nuisances are offenses against, or interferences with, the exercise of rights\ncommon to the public.’ (People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna (1997) 14 Cal.4th 1090, 1103 [60\nCal.Rptr.2d 277, 929 P.2d 596], [first italics added, second italics are] original italics.) ‘Of\ncourse, not every interference with collective social interests constitutes a public nuisance.\nTo qualify, and thus be enjoinable [or abatable], the interference must be both substantial\nand unreasonable.’ ([Id. at p. 1105].) It is substantial if it causes significant harm and\nunreasonable if its social utility is outweighed by the gravity of the harm inflicted. ([Ibid].)”\n(Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 305.)\n\n\n\n\n53\n       They also claim that, “if this were a factual question, not a legal one,” we would be\nprecluded from inferring a trial court finding on it because the trial court failed to identify\nany “public right” in its statement of decision even though it was pointed out to the court in\nobjections. However, they concede that this is a legal issue, and we agree.\n                                                 62\n\f       Defendants concede that a “public right is one relating to common resources,” but\nthey contend that interior residential lead paint does not interfere with any “public right”\nbecause it causes only private harms in private residences. They claim that the trial court\nerroneously based its public nuisance finding on an “aggregation of private harms.”\nDefendants contend that a public nuisance can exist only if it “harm[s] people in their\nexercise of a public right.” (Italics added.)\n       Interior residential lead paint that is in a dangerous condition does not merely pose a\nrisk of private harm in private residences. The community has a collective social interest in\nthe safety of children in residential housing. Interior residential lead paint interferes with\nthe community’s “public right” to housing that does not poison children. This interference\nseriously threatens to cause grave harm to the physical health of the community’s children.\nDefendants cite no California authority for their claim that no public right is threatened by\ninterior residential lead paint, and we reject their reliance on Rhode Island and Illinois cases\napplying those states’ laws, which they seem to concede are not as broad as California’s.\n       Defendants argue that “[t]he ‘public’ has no right to be present inside a private home,\nand thus, any possible lead exposure inside a private home cannot occur in the exercise of\nany public right.” Most members of the “public” reside in residential housing, and we do\nnot accept defendants’ claim that, unlike streets, residential housing is not a shared\ncommunity resource. Residential housing, like water, electricity, natural gas, and sewer\nservices, is an essential community resource. Indeed, without residential housing, it would\nbe nearly impossible for the “public” to obtain access to water, electricity, gas, and sewer\nservices. Pervasive lead exposure in residential housing threatens the public right to\nessential community resources. We reject defendants’ contention that interior residential\nlead paint cannot interfere with a public right.\n\n\n\n\n                                                63\n\f         C. Regulatory Standards, Nuisance Per Se, and Separation of Powers\n       Defendants claim that interior residential lead paint cannot be a public nuisance\nbecause it does not violate any regulatory standards, and “[t]he court must follow state\nregulations declaring intact LBP [lead-based paint] not a hazard, even on friction surfaces.\n(H&S Code §17920.10.)”\n       “Nothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be\ndeemed a nuisance.” (Civ. Code, § 3482.) Health and Safety Code section 17920.10 does\nnot “declar[e]” that “intact” lead paint is “not a hazard.” This statute provides that buildings\nthat contain “lead hazards,” as it defines them “for the purposes of this part” (primarily\n                                                                            54\ndeteriorated lead paint), are in violation of the Health and Safety Code.        (Health & Saf.\n\n\n\n54\n        Health and Safety Code section 17920.10 provides: “(a) Any building or portion\nthereof including any dwelling unit, guestroom, or suite of rooms, or portion thereof, or the\npremises on which it is located, is deemed to be in violation of this part as to any portion\nthat contains lead hazards. For purposes of this part, ‘lead hazards’ means deteriorated\nlead-based paint, lead-contaminated dust, lead-contaminated soil, or disturbing lead-based\npaint without containment, if one or more of these hazards are present in one or more\nlocations in amounts that are equal to or exceed the amounts of lead established for these\nterms in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 35001) of Division 1 of Title 17 of the\nCalifornia Code of Regulations or by this section and that are likely to endanger the health\nof the public or the occupants thereof as a result of their proximity to the public or the\noccupants thereof. [¶] (b) In the absence of new regulations adopted by the State\nDepartment of Health Services in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of\nDivision 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) further interpreting or clarifying the terms\n‘deteriorated lead-based paint,’ ‘lead-based paint,’ ‘lead-contaminated dust,’ ‘containment,’\nor ‘lead-contaminated soil,’ regulations in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 35001) of\nDivision 1 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations adopted by the State\nDepartment of Health Services pursuant to Sections 105250 and 124150 shall interpret or\nclarify these terms. If the State Department of Health Services adopts new regulations\ndefining these terms, the new regulations shall supersede the prior regulations for the\npurposes of this part. [¶] (c) In the absence of new regulations adopted by the State\nDepartment of Health Services in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act defining the term ‘disturbing lead-based paint without\ncontainment’ or modifying the term ‘deteriorated lead-based paint,’ for purposes of this part\n‘disturbing lead-based paint without containment’ and ‘deteriorated lead-based paint’ shall\n                                              64\n\fCode, § 17920.10, subd. (a).) Nowhere in this statute does the Legislature declare that any\nother type of lead paint in buildings is not a hazard, is lawful, or is authorized by statute.\nAll that this statute does is identify certain defined “lead hazards” as violations of the Health\nand Safety Code. The mere fact that not all interior residential lead paint violates the Health\nand Safety Code does not mean that it cannot be abated as a public nuisance. “ ‘A statutory\nsanction cannot be pleaded in justification of acts which by the general rules of law\nconstitute a nuisance, unless the acts complained of are authorized by the express terms of\nthe statute under which the justification is made, or by the plainest and most necessary\nimplication from the powers expressly conferred, so that it can be fairly stated that the\nlegislature contemplated the doing of the very act which occasions the injury.’ ” (Hassell v.\nCity and County of San Francisco (1938) 11 Cal.2d 168, 171.)\n       Nor does the absence of a regulation or statute declaring interior residential lead\npaint to be unlawful bar a court from declaring it to be a public nuisance. “The fact that a\nbuilding was constructed in accordance with all existing statutes does not immunize it from\nsubsequent abatement as a public nuisance. . . . It would be an unreasonable limitation on\nthe powers of the city to require that this [presently existing] danger be tolerated ad\n\n\nbe considered lead hazards as described in subdivision (a) only if the aggregate affected\narea is equal to or in excess of one of the following: [¶] (1) Two square feet in any one\ninterior room or space. [¶] (2) Twenty square feet on exterior surfaces. [¶] (3) Ten\npercent of the surface area on the interior or exterior type of component with a small surface\narea. Examples include window sills, baseboards, and trim. [¶] (d) Notwithstanding\nsubdivision (c), ‘disturbing lead-based paint without containment’ and ‘deteriorated lead-\nbased paint’ shall be considered lead hazards, for purposes of this part, if it is determined\nthat an area smaller than those specified in subdivision (c) is associated with a person with a\nblood lead level equal to or greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter. [¶] (e) If the State\nDepartment of Health Services adopts regulations defining or redefining the terms\n‘deteriorated lead-based paint,’ ‘lead-contaminated dust,’ ‘lead-contaminated soil,’\n‘disturbing lead-based paint without containment,’ ‘containment,’ or ‘lead-based paint,’ the\neffective date of the new regulations shall be deferred for a minimum of three months after\ntheir approval by the Office of Administrative Law and the regulations shall take effect on\nthe next July 1 or January 1 following that three-month period. Until the new definitions\napply, the prior definition shall apply.”\n                                               65\n\finfinitum merely because the [building] did not violate the statutes in effect when it was\nconstructed 36 years ago.” (Miller, supra, 64 Cal.2d at pp. 101-102.)\n          Defendants contend: “[T]he trial court declared lead paint to be a nuisance by\ncategory. This inverts the role of the two branches of government, because only the\nLegislature has the power to choose between declaring a nuisance per se and finding a\nnuisance in specific circumstances.” The trial court did no such thing. “Generally a\nnuisance is defined as ‘[a]nything which is injurious to health, or is indecent or offensive to\nthe senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the\ncomfortable enjoyment of life or property . . . .’ (Civ. Code, § 3479.) This requires\nconsideration and balancing of a variety of factors. [Citations.] However, where the law\nexpressly declares something to be a nuisance, then no inquiry beyond its existence need be\nmade and in this sense its mere existence is said to be a nuisance per se. [Citation.] But, to\nrephrase the rule, to be considered a nuisance per se the object, substance, activity or\ncircumstance at issue must be expressly declared to be a nuisance by its very existence by\nsome applicable law.” (Beck, supra, 44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1206-1207.)\n          The trial court did not declare the “very existence” of lead paint or even interior\nresidential lead paint to be a public nuisance. The court crafted a very limited order\nrequiring abatement of only deteriorated interior lead paint, lead paint on friction surfaces,\nand lead-contaminated soil at residences in the 10 jurisdictions. It did not find that lead\npaint itself is a nuisance per se but only that the specific targets of its order produce or\ncontain lead that has been shown to threaten the safety of children in their homes. It is only\nunder these limited circumstances that lead paint poses an immediate threat to the health of\nchildren and must be abated as a public nuisance. The court’s order was well within the\ngeneral authority of Civil Code section 3479, so its order was not a declaration of a nuisance\nper se.\n          Defendants argue that the trial court’s order violated separation of powers principles\nbecause the Legislature chose in 2001 not to declare the presence of lead paint in a\n\n                                                 66\n\fresidence to be a nuisance. They assert that the Legislature rejected a 2001 bill that would\nhave declared the presence of lead paint in a residence to be a public nuisance and instead\nenacted a statute that “permits owners to maintain intact LBP in residences.” Defendants\nmisrepresent the nature of the Legislature’s 2001 actions. The unpassed bill, Assembly Bill\nNo. 422 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) would have enacted a statute providing that “[a]ny\ncondition on real property that a local health department has determined poses a lead hazard\nrisk to public children is a public nuisance for purposes of Section 3479 of the Civil Code.”\n(Assem. Bill No. 422 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as introduced and amended Feb. 20, 2001.)\nThis bill was not limited to residences, did not address “intact” lead paint, and did not\npropose to declare anything to be a public nuisance absent a determination by a local\nagency. The enacted bill, Senate Bill No. 460, was directed toward lead hazard abatement.\nIt enacted Health and Safety Code section 17920.10, providing that a “dwelling” would be\n“deemed untenantable” if it “contains lead hazards” as defined (primarily deteriorated lead\npaint). Senate Bill No. 460 also enacted Health and Safety Code section 17980, which\nmandated that an “enforcement agency” that “determined” a building contained “lead\nhazards” “shall commence proceedings to abate the violation by repair, rehabilitation,\nvacation, or demolition of the building.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 17980, subd. (b)(1).) And\nit provided for criminal charges against a person who did not comply with such an\nabatement order. (Health & Saf. Code, § 105256.)\n       First of all, “[u]npassed bills, as evidences of legislative intent, have little value.”\n(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1396.)\nFurthermore, the Legislature’s 2001 actions cannot reasonably be viewed as rejecting the\npossibility that conditions created by lead paint in the interiors of residences that posed an\nimminent danger to children could constitute public nuisances. By authorizing abatement\nactions for lead hazards and criminal charges against those who did not comply with\nabatement orders, the Legislature took a strong stance against lead hazards in dwellings by\nenacting Senate Bill No. 460. Assembly Bill No. 422, unlike Senate Bill No. 460 and the\n\n                                                67\n\ftrial court’s order, was not limited to dwellings and gave local health departments the power\nto declare “real property” to be a public nuisance. The Legislature’s rejection of Assembly\nBill No. 422 was therefore not a rejection of the potential for a court to conclude that certain\nconditions created by lead paint in the interiors of residences and posing an imminent\ndanger to children were public nuisances.\n       Defendants also submit an extended argument that the trial court’s order has adverse\npolicy implications. We are not persuaded that these arguments could support a reversal of\nthe trial court’s abatement order. It may well be that a multi-pronged approach to this\nproblem will be necessary, with the court’s abatement order serving as merely one of\nseveral methods necessary to resolve this problem. What the evidence in this case\ndemonstrates is that defendants are wrong in claiming that California’s statutory scheme\ncreating the CLPPB and local CLPPPs fully addresses childhood lead exposure.\n       The CLPPB’s $28 million annual budget is largely funded by a special fee called the\nChildhood Lead Poisoning Prevention fee, and also by Medi-Cal, the EPA, the CDC, and a\nspecial fund for lead-related construction. The Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention fee,\nwhich provides about $20 million a year, is funded by the industries that put lead into the\nenvironment. About 14 percent of those fees are paid by makers and former makers of\n                              55\n“architectural coatings.”          The vast majority of the fees are paid by motor vehicle fuel\n                56\ndistributors.        Even with the CLPPB, local CLPPPs, and state statutes addressing lead\n\n\n\n\n55\n        “ ‘Architectural coating’ means any product which is used as, or usable as, a coating\napplied to the interior or exterior surfaces of stationary structures and their appurtenances,\nto portable buildings, to pavements, or to curbs, such as house and trim paints, varnishes,\nstains, lacquers, industrial maintenance coatings, primers, undercoaters, and traffic\ncoatings.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 33002.)\n56\n       Motor vehicle fuel contained lead from the 1920s until it began to be phased out in\nthe 1970s and 1980s. It was not eliminated until the 1990s. The percentages were not\nbased on distribution of lead into the environment by the products but on the amount of lead\nused in the products.\n                                                     68\n\fhazards, many children in the 10 jurisdictions continue to suffer serious harm from lead\npaint in their homes.\n       The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that the trial court’s abatement order\nwill reduce the risk of further harm to children in the 10 jurisdictions from lead paint. The\nLegislature has not precluded courts from utilizing public nuisance law to prevent further\nharm, and we are aware of no public policy reason to preclude courts from taking such\nactions. Lead poisoning has been estimated to cost society $50 billion a year. For every\ndollar that is spent on preventing lead exposure, there is a savings to society of between $17\nand $220. We reject defendants’ claims that the court’s abatement order usurps the\nLegislature’s powers.\n\n\n                               D. Joint and Several Liability\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in imposing joint and several liability.\nThey claim that this resulted in a “disproportionate, unfair burden” being placed on each of\nthem when many people were involved in the creation of the nuisance.\n       The trial court expressly found that “[d]efendants offered no evidence that an\nabatement remedy can be apportioned” and that the remedy was indivisible. While liability\noften may be capable of apportionment in a public nuisance case, “[t]here are other cases in\nwhich the harm resulting from a nuisance is not capable of apportionment to the several\ncontributors upon any reasonable or rational basis.” (Rest.2d. Torts, § 840E, com. c.) Each\ndefendant bore the burden of producing evidence upon which an apportionment could be\nmade. (Rest.2d Torts, § 840E, com. b.) “Unless sufficient evidence permits the factfinder\nto determine that damages are divisible, they are indivisible.” (Rest.3d Torts:\nApportionment of Liability, § 26, com. g.) When a court determines that apportionment\ncannot be accomplished, each defendant who contributed is liable for the entire harm.\n(Rest.2d Torts, § 840E, com. c.)\n\n\n\n                                              69\n\f       “Where several persons act in concert and damages result from their joint tort, each\nperson is held for the entire damages unless segregation as to causation can be established.\nEven though persons are not acting in concert, if the result produced by their acts are [sic]\nindivisible, each person is held liable for the whole. . . . The reason for imposing liability\non each for the entire consequence is that there exists no basis for dividing damages and the\nlaw is loath to permit an innocent plaintiff to suffer as against a wrongdoing defendant.\nThis liability is imposed where each cause is sufficient in itself as well as where each cause\nis required to produce the result. [¶] . . . [T]he same reason[s] of policy and justice shift\nthe burden to each of defendants to absolve himself if he can—relieving the wronged person\nof the duty of apportioning the injury to a particular defendant, apply here where we are\nconcerned with whether plaintiff is required to supply evidence for the apportionment of\ndamages. If defendants are independent tort feasors and thus each liable for the damage\ncaused by him alone, and, at least, where the matter of apportionment is incapable of proof,\nthe innocent wronged party should not be deprived of his right to redress. The wrongdoers\nshould be left to work out between themselves an apportionment.” (Finnegan v. Royal\nRealty Co. (1950) 35 Cal.2d 409, 433-434.)\n       “[T]he mere fact that it may be possible to assign some percentage figure to the\nrelative culpability of one negligent defendant as compared to another does not in any way\nsuggest that each defendant’s negligence is not a proximate cause of the entire indivisible\ninjury.” (American Motorcycle Assn. v. Superior Court (1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 588-589\n[citing Finnegan].) “Principles of equitable indemnity would enable these defendants to\nsort out their respective liabilities. It does not affect the right of a plaintiff to recover the\nentire judgment from any one of them.” (Sanchez v. Bay General Hospital (1981) 116\nCal.App.3d 776, 796-797.)\n       The trial court determined that defendants had failed to establish that the public\nnuisance was divisible, and we review this factual finding for substantial evidence. Only\nSWC argues that it presented evidence supporting an apportionment. SWC asserts that it\n\n                                                 70\n\fwas responsible for only a tiny percentage of “the total lead used in California from 1894 to\n2009,” that it paid its share of the CLPP fee, and that “thousands of persons contributed” to\nthe presence of lead paint inside residences. The trial court could reasonably conclude that\nSWC’s evidence did not support an apportionment of liability for the public nuisance\ncreated by the promotion of lead paint for interior residential use by defendants. The\nevidence presented at trial did not establish that an entity’s share of the total amount of lead\nused in California bore any relationship to that entity’s liability for the amount of lead paint\npresent in residences in the 10 jurisdictions. The evidence presented at trial indicated that\nnonresidential uses of lead have been the historically predominant ones. The Legislature’s\nestablishment of the CLPP fee was not intended to limit liability for promotion of lead paint\nfor interior residential use, as that fee was not premised on such conduct but merely on total\nlead contribution. Finally, SWC did not establish that the “thousands of persons” who were\nalso involved in the use of lead paint inside residences (painters, architects, homeowners,\netc.) promoted the use of lead paint inside residences with knowledge of the danger such\nuse would produce. Thus, those persons were not joint tortfeasors with defendants. Since\ndefendants failed to show that the public nuisance was divisible, we uphold the trial court’s\nimposition of joint and several liability for the nuisance created by defendants’ conduct.\n\n\n                          E. Collective Liability and Due Process\n       Defendants argue that the court erred in “categorically declar[ing] all properties with\ninterior LBP to be a nuisance sight unseen.” Defendants maintain that the court’s finding of\na “collective nuisance” deprived them of due process because they did not have the\nopportunity to inspect each individual property and defend against their liability on a\nresidence-by-residence basis. They insist that plaintiff was required to identify the location\nof each individual property in order to establish a public nuisance. Defendants claim that\nthe court’s order cannot be upheld because there was no evidence that any individual\ndefendant’s lead was present in any specific location. They assert that access to individual\n\n                                               71\n\fproperties would have permitted each of them to “rule out the presence of its WLC [white\nlead carbonate], to develop evidence of the primary lead sources, to prove the owner’s fault,\nor to show that its WLC, if present, posed no imminent threat of harm to any child.” They\ncontend that due process forbids requiring any one defendant to abate a nuisance created by\n“others’ products.”\n       The trial court did not “declare” all interior lead paint to be a public nuisance.\nInstead, the court’s abatement order was limited to conditions created by interior residential\nlead paint that placed children at imminent risk of harm. Due to the nature of the conduct\nthat defendants engaged in, knowingly promoting lead paint for interior residential use\nthroughout a vast area that is home to millions of people, every one of the precise locations\nat which these conditions currently exist has not yet been fully catalogued. Plaintiff\nestablished the existence of a public nuisance by proving that these conditions are pervasive\nin the 10 jurisdictions, but the enormous cost of discovering each and every one of the\nspecific locations where remediation is necessary must be borne by the wrongdoers, in this\ncase defendants. It cannot be that the highly insidious character of the public nuisance\ncreated by defendants renders it beyond the reach of a public nuisance abatement action.\n       Defendants were not deprived of due process because they were not provided with\naccess to individual properties. None of the defendants claimed that it could differentiate\n“its” lead paint from other lead paint at an individual location. And even if a defendant\ncould have proved that its paint was present in only a portion of the individual properties,\nthe identity of the manufacturer of lead paint at a specific location was of limited relevance.\nDefendants were held liable for promoting lead paint for interior residential use. Their\npromotional activities were not limited to advertisements for their own lead paints. They\nalso generically promoted lead paint for interior residential use. Furthermore, nothing\nprecludes a defendant from testing the lead paint at specific locations during the remediation\nprocess and seeking to hold a fellow defendant liable for a greater share of the\n\n\n\n                                               72\n\fresponsibility. The same is true of evidence that the hazardous condition is “the owner’s\nfault” or that it is not hazardous.\n       None of the cases defendants rely upon has any import on this issue. Defendants rely\non class certification cases stating that a defendant has a right to assert individual defenses\nto each class member’s entitlement to recover. (Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes (2011) 564\nU.S. 338, 366; Duran v. U.S. Bank National Assn. (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1, 29; In re Fibreboard\nCorp. (5th Cir. 1990) 893 F.2d 706 [asbestos class action].) This is not a class action, and\nno individuals seek to recover anything from defendants. Stanley v. Illinois (1972) 405 U.S.\n645 is also not on point, as it concerned due process rights in an action to terminate a\nfather’s parental rights. McClatchy v. Superior Court of County of Sacramento (1897) 119\nCal. 413 does not support defendants’ argument as it concerned a newspaper editor’s due\nprocess right to offer a defense in a contempt proceeding.\n       Since defendants have failed to establish that the court’s public nuisance findings and\nabatement order deprived them of due process by imposing “collective liability,” we reject\ntheir contention.\n\n\n                           F. Disproportionality and Due Process\n       Defendants argue that the court’s abatement order violates due process because it\n“grossly exceeds” their individual responsibility for the nuisance.\n       The trial court found that defendants promoted lead paint for interior residential use\nin the 10 jurisdictions and that their conduct was a substantial factor in creating the existing\npublic nuisance that requires remediation. Since their conduct caused the existing public\nnuisance that they are being ordered to abate, the burden of that remediation is not\ndisproportional to their individual responsibilities for assisting in its creation. Defendants’\nreliance on punitive damages and penalty cases is misplaced. Here, defendants are not\nbeing penalized or required to pay damages of any kind. They are being required simply to\n\n\n\n                                               73\n\fclean up the hazardous conditions that they assisted in creating. Requiring them to do so is\nnot disproportional to their wrongdoing.\n       Defendants also complain that the trial court imposed “retroactive liability” “in\nhindsight.” Not so. The only conduct for which defendants are being held responsible is\ntheir promotion of lead paint for interior residential use knowing of the public health hazard\nthat such use would create. There is no “hindsight” or “retroactive liability” involved in\nrequiring those who knowingly engage in hazardous conduct to remediate the consequences\nof their conduct.\n\n\n                                    G. Denial of Jury Trial\n       Defendants claim that the trial court erred in denying them a jury trial. They\nmaintain that the California Constitution guaranteed them a right to a jury trial in this public\nnuisance action by the government even though this was an equitable action seeking only\nabatement because, they argue, the common law in 1850 recognized a right to a jury trial in\npublic nuisance actions except for an action based on a nuisance per se.\n       Plaintiff, NL, and ConAgra filed jury demands. However, plaintiff subsequently\nfiled a motion to strike the jury demands and to have a court trial. Plaintiff asserted that\nthere was no right to jury trial on a public nuisance cause of action seeking abatement or on\na cause of action for equitable contribution or declaratory relief. Defendants opposed\nplaintiff’s motion to strike the jury demands. The court granted plaintiff’s motion and\nstruck the jury demands, and the case was tried to the court.\n       “Trial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all . . . .” (Cal. Const., art.\nI, § 16.) Generally, “if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought ‘depends\nupon the application of equitable doctrines,’ the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.” (C &\nK Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co. (1978) 23 Cal.3d 1, 9.) However, “[i]t is\nsettled that the state constitutional right to a jury trial ‘is the right as it existed at common\nlaw in 1850, when the Constitution was first adopted, “and what that right is, is a purely\n\n                                                74\n\fhistorical question, a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social, political or legal\nfact.” [Citations.]’ ” (Franchise Tax Bd. v. Superior Court (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1006, 1010.)\n       “Our state Constitution essentially preserves the right to a jury in those actions in\nwhich there was a right to a jury trial at common law at the time the Constitution was first\nadopted. [Citation.] Thus, the scope of the constitutional right to jury trial depends on the\nprovisions for jury trial at common law. The historical analysis of the common law right to\njury often relies on the traditional distinction between courts at law, in which a jury sat, and\ncourts of equity, in which there was no jury.” (Crouchman v. Superior Court (1988) 45\nCal.3d 1167, 1175.)\n       “In determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law, the\ncourt is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved\nand the facts of the particular case—the gist of the action. A jury trial must be granted\nwhere the gist of the action is legal, where the action is in reality cognizable at law.\n[¶] . . . The constitutional right of trial by jury is not to be narrowly construed. It is not\nlimited strictly to those cases in which it existed before the adoption of the Constitution but\nis extended to cases of like nature as may afterwards arise. It embraces cases of the same\nclass thereafter arising.” (People v. One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe (1951) 37 Cal.2d 283, 299-\n300 (One 1941).)\n       The question before us is whether in 1850 the common law recognized a right to a\njury trial in public nuisance actions by the government that sought only abatement or in\n“cases of like nature.” At the outset, we must consider exactly what cases are of “like\nnature” to the one before us. Many of the cases relied on by the parties are private nuisance,\nrather than public nuisance, cases. Others sought damages, rather than or in addition to\nequitable relief. Still others sought an injunction, but the nature of the injunction was not\nremedial, but preventative, or was an interlocutory injunction pending trial, rather than\npermanent relief after a full trial.\n\n\n\n                                                75\n\f       “Unlike public nuisance, which is an interference with the rights of the community at\nlarge, private nuisance is a civil wrong based on disturbance of rights in land. [Citation.] A\nnuisance may be both public and private, but to proceed on a private nuisance theory the\nplaintiff must prove an injury specifically referable to the use and enjoyment of his or her\nland. The injury, however, need not be different in kind from that suffered by the general\npublic.” (Koll-Irvine Center Property Owners Assn. v. County of Orange (1994) 24\nCal.App.4th 1036, 1041.) While damages may be available in both public and private\nnuisance actions, damages are not an available remedy in the type of public nuisance action\nthat was brought by plaintiff in this case, a representative public nuisance action.\n“[A]lthough California’s general nuisance statute expressly permits the recovery of\ndamages in a public nuisance action brought by a specially injured party, it does not grant a\ndamage remedy in actions brought on behalf of the People to abate a public nuisance.”\n(People ex rel. Van de Kamp v. American Art Enterprises, Inc. (1983) 33 Cal.3d 328, 333,\nfn. 11.) Code of Civil Procedure section 731 permits such an action to “abate a public\nnuisance,” but it does not allow the government to seek damages.\n       Because public and private nuisance actions are distinct, and public nuisance actions\nbrought as representative actions are different from those brought by the government on its\nown behalf, our examination of this issue must focus on whether the common law in 1850\ngranted a right to a jury trial in a representative public nuisance action by the government\nseeking only abatement.\n       Defendants rely heavily on an 1849 treatise written by United States Supreme Court\nJustice Joseph Story. The Fifth Edition of this treatise explained that a “public nuisance”\nwas traditionally punished by way of an indictment. It went on to say: “But an information\nalso lies in Equity to redress the grievance by way of injunction. . . . If the soil does not\nbelong to the crown, but it is merely a common nuisance to all the public, an information in\nEquity lies. But the question of nuisance or not must, in cases of doubt, be tried by a jury;\n\n\n\n                                               76\n\fand the injunction will be granted or not, as that fact is decided.” (Story’s Commentaries on\nEquity Jurisprudence as administered in England (5th ed. 1849) chpt. XXIII, § 923, p. 251.)\n       Justice Story’s treatise provides some support for defendants’ claim that they were\nentitled to a jury trial in this case. However, a treatise is not itself sufficient to establish this\nfactual question. We must examine the cases cited by Justice Story as support for this\npassage to determine whether they reflect that a right to a jury trial was recognized in 1850\nfor a representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only abatement.\n       One of the cases cited by Justice Story was The Attorney General v. Cleaver (1811)\n34 Eng.Rep. 297 [18 Ves. Jun. 212] (Cleaver). Cleaver was an action by the Attorney-\nGeneral “at the relation of individuals” seeking a temporary and permanent restraining order\n                                                                                    57\nagainst a manufacturer whose factory was causing injury to nearby residents.             (Ibid.) The\nissue before the court was whether to grant a request for a pretrial injunction. (Ibid.) The\ncourt declined to issue an injunction in advance of a trial on whether the factory constituted\na nuisance. The court stated: “[I]f the soil belongs to the Crown, there is one species of\nremedy for that: the Crown may abate the obstruction; as it is upon the King’s soil. Where\nit is not upon the King’s soil, but merely a public nuisance to all the King’s subjects, though\nthe suit may be in the same form, the law is laid down in treatises [citation] that upon the\nground of public nuisance, and not as an obstruction upon the King’s soil, it is a question of\nfact, which must be tried by a Jury; and, though the suit may be entertained, the Court\nwould be bound to try the fact by the intervention of a Jury.” (Cleaver, at p. 299, italics\nadded.) While Cleaver appears to support the proposition that, as of 1811, a jury trial may\nhave been required in a representative public nuisance action seeking only an injunction, it\n\n\n\n\n57\n        Although the Attorney-General brought the action, the manufacturer asserted that\n“[t]his is not a public prosecution by the Attorney General, but at the relation of several\ninhabitants of the neighbourhood; and there is a wide distinction between the two sorts of\nInformation.” (Cleaver, supra, 34 Eng.Rep at p. 298.)\n                                                 77\n\fis notable that Cleaver did not involve a remedial abatement order but a prohibitory\ninjunction.\n       A subsequent case, Earl of Ripon v. Hobart (1834) 40 Eng.Rep. 65 [also reported at\n47 Eng.Rep. 119] (Earl of Ripon), pointed out the important distinction between a\nprohibitory or preventative injunction and other types of injunctive relief. Earl of Ripon\nconcerned an action brought by the government seeking an injunction to preclude the use of\nsteam engines (instead of windmills) to drain lowlands. (Earl of Ripon, at pp. 65-67.) The\nplaintiffs claimed steam engines would send water more continuously and more quickly into\nthe river than would windmills, thereby putting pressure on and damaging the river’s banks.\n(Earl of Ripon, at p. 65.) The Chancellor refused to grant an injunction. The Chancellor\ndescribed “the rule respecting the relief by injunction, as applied to such cases to be,” which\nit described as cases of “eventual or contingent nuisance.” (Earl of Ripon, at p. 69, italics\nadded.) “If the thing sought to be prohibited is in itself a nuisance, the Court will interfere\nto stay irreparable mischief, without waiting for the result of a trial; and will, according to\nthe circumstances, direct an issue, or allow an action, and, if need be, expedite the\nproceedings, the injunction being in the meantime continued. But where the thing sought to\nbe restrained is not unavoidably and in itself noxious, but only something which may\naccording to circumstances, prove so, then the Court will refuse to interfere until the matter\nhas been tried at law, generally by an action, though, in particular cases, an issue may be\ndirected for the satisfaction of the Court, where an action could not be framed so as to meet\nthe question. [¶] The distinction between the two kinds of erection or operation is obvious,\nand the soundness of that discretion seems undeniable, which would be very slow to\ninterfere where the thing to be stopped, while it is highly beneficial to one party, may very\npossibly be prejudicial to none. The great fitness of pausing much before we interrupt men\nin those modes of enjoying or improving their property which are prima facie harmless, or\neven praiseworthy, is equally manifest; and it is always to be borne in mind that the\njurisdiction of this Court over nuisance by injunction at all is of recent growth, has not till\n\n                                               78\n\fvery lately been much exercised, and has at various times found great reluctance on the part\nof the learned Judges to use it, even in cases where the thing or the act complained of was\nadmitted to be directly and immediately hurtful to the Complainant.” (Ibid.)\n       The explanation given by the Chancellor in Earl of Ripon illuminates the limited\nnature of the rules governing the power of equity courts to grant injunctions that were\nevolving at that time, and that had not been explicated in Cleaver. The Chancellor’s\nreluctance to grant injunctive relief without a jury trial in Earl of Ripon was due to the fact\nthat the nuisance was “contingent,” that is, prospective, and therefore an injunction would\nbar potentially beneficial activity. (Earl of Ripon, supra, 40 Eng.Rep. at p. 69.) That type\nof injunction differs dramatically from a remedial abatement order. When the government\nseeks a remedial abatement order, the nuisance is not contingent, and the remedy does not\nbar some prospective activity. Abatement is restricted to undoing already accomplished\nharmful conditions. The rule described by the Chancellor in Earl of Ripon did not require a\njury trial in cases seeking a remedial abatement order.\n       The remaining cases cited by Justice Story all fall within the rule described in Earl of\nRipon; they concerned prohibitory injunctions against activities that might prove beneficial\nand might not prove to cause the feared harm. Attorney-General v. Cohoes Co. (N.Y. Ch.\n1836) 1836 WL 2625 [6 Paige Ch. 133; 3 N.Y. Ch.Ann. 928] was solely concerned with a\npretrial motion to dissolve an injunction; the court denied the motion. The injunction had\nbeen obtained to prevent a mill company from breaching a canal and withdrawing water\npending trial on whether the breach would create a public nuisance. (Cohoes, at pp. 134-\n135.) Attorney General v. Forbes (1836) 40 Eng.Rep. 587 [2 My. & Cr. 123] (Forbes) was\n                                                                                               58\na pretrial request for an injunction to prevent the potential creation of a public nuisance.\n\n\n58\n       Forbes was a dispute between Bucks County and Berks County about the repair of a\nbridge that ran across the river between the two counties. The center of the bridge was the\nline between the two counties. Although the two counties had originally agreed to share the\ncost of repairs to the bridge, when it came time for additional repairs to the bridge, they\ncould not reach an agreement on the mode of repair. (Forbes, supra, 40 Eng.Rep. at\n                                               79\n\fNotably, in neither Cohoes nor Forbes was a jury trial required before the court granted an\ninjunction.\n       Crowder v. Tinkler (1816) 34 Eng.Rep. 645 [19 Ves. Jun. 618] (Crowder) was an\naction by private plaintiffs seeking a pretrial injunction to stop the defendants from building\na new building and using it to store gunpowder close to the plaintiffs’ paper mills and\nhomes. (Crowder, at pp. 645-646, 647-648 [19 Ves. Jun., at pp. 618-619, 625].) Crowder\nis distinguishable both because it was not a representative public nuisance action and\nbecause it sought a prohibitory injunction.\n       Mohawk Bridge Co. v. Utica & S.R. Co. (N.Y. Ch. 1837) 6 Paige Ch. 554 [1837 WL\n2675] (Mohawk Bridge) was an action by a bridge company seeking an injunction to\nprevent the erection by a railway company of a railway bridge over a river. (Mohawk\nBridge, at p. 561.) The government was not the plaintiff. The New York court reasoned:\n“If the thing sought to be prohibited is in itself a nuisance, the court will interfere to stay\nirreparable mischief, where the complainant’s right is not doubtful, without waiting for the\nresult of a trial. But where the thing sought to be restrained is not in itself noxious, but only\n\n\n\npp. 587-588 [2 My. & Cr., at pp. 123-124].) Berks County wanted to rebuild the entire\nbridge out of iron. Bucks County wanted to repair the wooden bridge. (Forbes, at pp. 588-\n589 [2 My. & Cr., at p. 125].) The oak joists that supported the center of the bridge ran\nfrom one county’s last pier to the other county’s last pier and had been funded equally by\nboth counties when the bridge was previously repaired. (Forbes, at pp. 587-588 [2 My. &\nCr., at pp. 123-124].) Bucks proposed a plan of repair that would have replaced the oak\njoists that supported the center with new oak joists, but Berks would not agree to that plan.\nBucks was forced to alter its plan and instead repaired its half of the bridge in such a fashion\nthat the old oak joists were left undisturbed and new joists were run only from the center of\nthe bridge to the last pier in Bucks County. (Forbes, at pp. 588-589 [2 My. & Cr., at pp.\n125-126].) The new joists depended on the old joists for support. (Ibid.) Berks then\nnotified Bucks that it intended to cut the old oak joists at the center, thereby depriving the\ncenter of the bridge of any support. (Forbes, at pp. 589-590 [2 My. & Cr., at pp. 126-127].)\nBucks sought a preventative injunction on the ground that the cutting of the old oak joists\nwould create a public nuisance because the center of the bridge would be unsupported.\n(Forbes, at p. 589 [2 My. & Cr., at p. 127].) The court granted a pretrial injunction.\n(Forbes, at p. 590 [2 My. & Cr., at pp. 129-130].)\n                                                80\n\fsomething which may according to circumstances prove to be so, the court will refuse to\ninterfere until the matter has been tried at law by an action; though in particular cases the\ncourt may direct an issue, for its own satisfaction, where an action could not be brought in\nsuch a form as to meet the question. And in applying these principles, if the magnitude of\nthe injury to be dreaded is great, and the risk so imminent that no prudent person would\nthink of incurring it, the court will not refuse its aid for the protection of the complainant’s\nrights, by injunction, on the ground that there is a bare possibility that the anticipated injury\nfrom the noxious erection may not happen.” (Mohawk, at p. 563.) As in Crowder, the\naction in Mohawk was not brought by the government and sought a prohibitory injunction.\n       Baines v. Baker (1752) 27 Eng.Rep. 105 [AMB. 158] (Baines) was a nuisance action\nbrought by a private party seeking an injunction to prevent the building of a hospital near\nthe plaintiff’s property to house patients suffering from smallpox. It was not an action\nbrought by the government, and, like the other cases, it was an action seeking a prohibitory\ninjunction, not a remedial injunction.\n       The remaining English cases cited by defendants are distinguishable on similar\ngrounds. The Attorney General v. The United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company\n(1861) 54 Eng.Rep. 899 [30 Beav. 287] (Electric Telegraph) was not an action for a\nremedial abatement order. In Electric Telegraph, the Baron and the Attorney General\nsought an “interlocutory injunction” to bar a telegraph company from putting telegraph\nwires in trenches across public highways and on land owned by the Baron. They claimed\nthat the wires created a public nuisance. (Electric Telegraph, at p. 901.) The court found\nthat, as to the Attorney General’s action, it was “very doubtful” whether there was a public\nnuisance and no clear showing of any injury to the public. (Ibid.) Under these\ncircumstances, the court refused to grant an injunction until the Attorney General\n“establish[es] the fact that the act done is a nuisance at law . . . .” (Ibid.) The court stated:\n“This case depends upon a legal right, which must be established to the satisfaction of the\nCourt before the equity can be administered; without it, it would be impossible to say that\n\n                                                81\n\feither the acts of the company or the works amounted to a nuisance. The one side insists\nthat the works cause an obstruction, and, on the other side, persons are found to say they do\nnot; but no tribunal is so fit to try this question of fact as a jury, who will have the assistance\n                                            59\nof a Judge to direct them as to the law.”        (Electric Telegraph, at p. 902.) While the\nElectric Telegraph opinion suggested that a jury trial would be appropriate to determine\nwhether the wires were a public nuisance, the court did not actually speak of a “right” to a\njury trial and did not consider whether a jury trial would be required in a public nuisance\naction seeking only a remedial abatement order. Instead, the court simply found that the\nevidence before it did not justify a finding that the wires were a public nuisance and\ndetermined that this issue would be best tried by a jury in that particular case. Since the\n\n\n59\n        Defendants cite an alternate version of this opinion in a different reporter. In the\nalternate version, the language is significantly different. At the beginning of the alternate\nversion, the court says: “The main question with which I have to deal now is, whether the\nacts complained of do or do not amount to a nuisance. If they did, I should have no\nhesitation in granting an injunction; but I confess I am not at present prepared to do more\nthan send the case to be tried before a jury, in an action at law.” The court then proceeds to\naddress the claims of the Baron and of the Attorney General separately.\n        Defendants quote the following language: “In ordinary cases, where the issue of a\nsuit in equity depends upon a legal right, that right must be ascertained at law before any\nrelief can be granted by this court.” This language appears in the portion of the alternate\nversion addressing the Baron’s claim, not the Attorney General’s claim, and the court took\ngreat pains to distinguish between the two claims. Hence, it is not material to the issue\nbefore us.\n       In the portion of the alternate version addressing the Attorney General’s claim, the\ncourt says: “With regard to the fact of these posts and wires being nuisances, I am by no\nmeans clear, that upon the evidence before me I can determine whether they are or are not\nsuch; at all events, I think I cannot say that they are. In truth, the question, what is a\nnuisance, is one peculiarly fitted for investigation by a jury.” (The Attorney-General v. The\nUnited Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company (1861) The Law Times, vol. V, N.S. at\npp. 338-339.) Even if we were to accept that the alternate version is entitled to credence, it\ndoes not support defendants’ claim. The court was unwilling to issue a preventative\ninjunction because it deemed the evidence before it to be inadequate, and it simply did not\nrule out that it might do so after a trial before a jury. This ruling does not establish that\nthere was a right to a jury trial at that time in a public nuisance action seeking only a\nremedial abatement order.\n                                                   82\n\faction before us did not seek a preventative injunction, and the trial court found the\nevidence sufficient to support a remedial injunction, Electric Telegraph is inapposite.\n       Walter v. Selfe (1851) 64 Eng.Rep. 849 (Walter) was a private nuisance action\nbetween private parties seeking an injunction. (Walter, at p. 851.) The Chancery court\nstated that the parties had “declin[ed] to go before a jury,” and it granted the plaintiffs’\nrequest for an injunction. (Walter, at p. 853.) Nowhere in the Walter opinion is there any\nindication that a public nuisance action by the government seeking only a remedial\ninjunction would have been required to be tried to a jury. Imperial Gas Light and Coke\nCompany v. Broadbent (1859) 11 Eng.Rep. 239 [7 H.L.C. 600] (Imperial) was not a public\nnuisance action but a private nuisance action between private parties in which the plaintiff\nsought an injunction to stop the defendants from manufacturing gas near his house. The\nopinion contains broad language: “There is no doubt whatever that before a perpetual\ninjunction can be granted, the party applying for it must establish his right by a proceeding\nat law.” (Imperial, at p. 242.) Since Imperial was a private nuisance action seeking a\nprohibitory injunction, its statements about the need for a proceeding “at law” (a jury trial)\ncan only be understood as applying in that context.\n       The distinction between prohibitory injunctions and abatement orders was\nrecognized in the 1850s in England. In Attorney-General v. Birmingham Council (1858) 70\nEng.Rep. 220 [4 K.&J. 528] (Birmingham), the plaintiffs sought an abatement order barring\nthe defendants from continuing to pollute a river with sewage. (Birmingham, at p. 220.)\nThe defendants argued before the Chancellor that under Cleaver and Earl of Ripon the\nChancellor should not interfere and should leave the plaintiffs to seek a remedy at common\nlaw. (Birmingham, at p. 223.) The Chancellor rejected this argument and granted an\nabatement injunction. (Birmingham, at p. 228.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               83\n\f                                                                                   60\n       The cases defendants cite from the United States are also distinguishable.       Pilcher\nv. Hart (1840) 20 Tenn. 524 was a trespass action for damages between private parties. (Id.\nat p. 530.) Davidson v. Isham (N.J. Ch. 1852) 9 N.J. Eq. 186 was an action between private\nparties. Middleton v. Franklin (1853) 3 Cal. 238 was an action between private parties.\nGunter v. Geary (1851) 1 Cal. 462 (Gunter) was an action for damages by private plaintiffs\nagainst the mayor of San Francisco for destroying the plaintiffs’ house, which had been\ntried to a jury and resulted in a judgment for damages. (Gunter, at pp. 463-464.) None of\nthese cases contains any indication of whether a jury trial was required at common law in\n1850 in a representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only a remedial\nabatement order.\n       The remaining California cases cited by defendants are similarly distinguishable.\nFarrell v. City of Ontario (1919) 39 Cal.App. 351 (Farrell) was a private nuisance action by\na private party against a municipality seeking both damages and an injunction. (Farrell, at\npp. 352-353.) The case was tried to a jury, which returned a damages verdict for the\nplaintiff. (Id. at p. 353.) The trial court nevertheless entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n\n60\n        Appeal of McClain (1890) 130 Pa. 546 (McClain), which defendants cite in a string\ncite but do not discuss, was an action by a city seeking the destruction of a dam on the\nground that it was a public nuisance. (McClain, at p. 560.) The Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt stated: “We do not question the power of a court of equity to restrain and abate\npublic nuisances. This is settled by a line of decisions. But the authorities uniformly limit\nthe jurisdiction to cases where the right has first been established at law, or is conceded. It\nwas never intended, and I do not know of a case in the books where a chancellor has\nusurped the functions of a jury, and attempted to decide disputed questions of fact, and pass\nupon conflicting evidence in such cases.” (McClain, at p. 562.) “We think that, under all\nthe circumstances of this case, the defendants are entitled to a trial by jury before their\nproperty shall be condemned as a nuisance, and destroyed.” (McClain, at p. 564.) While\nMcClain was a public nuisance action by the government seeking a remedial abatement\norder, it has little weight as authority because it significantly postdates 1850 (by four\ndecades) and appears to rely heavily on the fact that the requested relief was that private\nproperty be “condemned . . . and destroyed.” The case before us does not threaten the\ndestruction of any of defendants’ private property, and a case from 1890 does not provide\nstrong evidence of what was a common law right in 1850.\n                                              84\n\f(Ibid.) On appeal, the plaintiffs contended that they were entitled to a jury trial, and\ntherefore the trial court had erred in entering judgment contrary to the jury’s verdict. (Ibid.)\nThe court in Farrell relied on Walter and Imperial Gas in finding that there was a right to a\njury trial in this private nuisance action for damages. (Farrell, at pp. 356-357.) It held:\n“[U]nder the English common law as it stood in 1850, at the time it was adopted as the rule\nof decision in this state, ‘if a plaintiff applies for an injunction to restrain a violation of a\ncommon-law right, if either the existence of the right or the fact of its violation be disputed,\nhe must establish that right at law’; or, in other words, by a jury, if one be demanded. We\nconclude, therefore, that the parties here were entitled to a jury trial upon the issues as to\ndamages and that the verdict of the jury thereon was binding.” (Farrell, at p. 357.) Still,\nthe Farrell court emphasized that “the equitable issues . . . are to be determined by the court\nupon findings of fact made by it.” (Farrell, at p. 359, italics added.) Since Farrell was a\nprivate nuisance action seeking damages, it does not tell us whether a jury trial is required in\na representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only a remedial\nabatement order.\n       Pacific Western Oil Co. v. Bern Oil Co. (1939) 13 Cal.2d 60 (Pacific Western) was\nan action between private parties seeking a prohibitory injunction and damages. (Pacific\nWestern, at p. 64.) The trial court awarded damages and a prohibitory injunction. (Pacific\nWestern, at p. 66.) On appeal, the defendants contended that they had been deprived of\ntheir right to a jury trial, and the court, relying on Farrell, agreed. However, the court\nlimited its holding to situations “wherein both legal and equitable remedies are the subject\nof the action.” (Pacific Western, at p. 69.)\n       Pacific Western partly overruled McCarthy v. Gaston Ridge Mill & Mining Co.\n(1904) 144 Cal. 542 (McCarthy). McCarthy was a private nuisance action for damages and\nan injunction. Although a jury rejected the plaintiff’s damages claim, the trial court rejected\nthe jury’s verdict and awarded the plaintiff damages but no injunction. (McCarthy, at\npp. 543-545.) On appeal, the defendant contended that the plaintiff’s action was one in\n\n                                                 85\n\fwhich the defendant was entitled to a jury trial. (McCarthy, at p. 545.) The California\nSupreme Court disagreed. “The prevention or abatement of a nuisance is to be\naccomplished by means of an injunction either prohibitive or mandatory, and an action\ntherefor is within the equitable jurisdiction of the court, and is to be governed by the\nprinciples prevailing in that jurisdiction. [Citations.] The constitution does not give to a\nparty the right to have the issues in such action tried by a jury, nor is the action within those\nin which the legislature has authorized a jury trial.” (McCarthy, at pp. 545-546.) Pacific\nWestern overruled McCarthy to the extent that it held that there was no right to a jury trial\nin a private nuisance action that sought both an injunction and damages. (Pacific Western,\nsupra, 13 Cal.2d at p. 69.)\n       The California Supreme Court has never held that there is or is not a right to a jury\ntrial in a public nuisance action brought by the government that seeks only a remedial\nabatement order. It has held that there is no right to a jury trial in a private nuisance action\nseeking only abatement. Sullivan v. Royer (1887) 72 Cal. 248 (Sullivan) was an action to\nabate and enjoin a private nuisance. A jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendant\nappealed, claiming that the jury had been misinstructed. The California Supreme Court held\nthat any jury instruction errors were immaterial because there was no right to a jury trial in\nan equitable action to abate a nuisance. (Sullivan, at pp. 249-250.) The court reached the\nsame holding in Richardson v. City of Eureka (1895) 110 Cal. 441, which was also a private\nnuisance case. (Id. at p. 446.)\n       The California Supreme Court has mentioned in dicta that there is no right to a jury\ntrial in a public nuisance case seeking only abatement. One 1941 was a forfeiture case\nbrought by the government in which the legal owner of the vehicle claimed that he had been\ndenied his constitutional right to a jury trial. (One 1941, supra, 37 Cal.2d at pp. 285-286.)\nThe issue was whether an in rem forfeiture action was a common law action entitled to a\njury trial in 1850. The California Supreme Court compared an in rem forfeiture action to an\naction to abate a public nuisance. “ ‘The right of trial by jury did not exist at common law in\n\n                                               86\n\fa suit to abate a public nuisance. (People v. McCaddon, 48 Cal.App. 790, 792 [192 P.\n325].) Hence it is not a constitutional right now. [¶] Automobiles, carriages, wagons,\nhorses, and mules, that are ordinarily used for lawful purposes, cannot be classified with\nnarcotics, gambling paraphernalia, counterfeit coins, diseased cattle, obscene books and\npictures, decayed fruit and fish, unwholesome meat, infected clothing, or other contraband,\nwhich are ordinarily used for an unlawful purpose, and are public nuisances per se. [Fn.\nomitted.] While property kept in violation of law which is incapable of lawful use and\ndeclared to be a nuisance per se may be forfeited without a trial by jury under the police\npower, it does not follow that property ordinarily used for lawful purposes—innocent\nproperty—may be forfeited without a trial by jury where an issue of fact is joined as to\nwhether the property was being used for an unlawful purpose or is to be taken from an\ninnocent owner. There is no general constitutional right to a jury trial in actions for the\nseizure and forfeiture of contraband articles. [Fn. omitted.] But property is not contraband\nor a public nuisance merely because it was instrumental in the commission of a public\noffense.’ ” (One 1941, at pp. 298-299.)\n       In One 1941, the California Supreme Court cited People v. McCaddon (1920) 48\nCal.App. 790 (McCaddon) to support the proposition that there is no right to a jury trial in a\npublic nuisance action seeking only abatement. McCaddon was a public nuisance action by\nthe government to abate a public nuisance. (McCaddon, at p. 790.) The claim on appeal\nwas that the trial court had erred in denying the defendants a jury trial. (McCaddon, at\np. 791.) The Court of Appeal devoted no significant analysis to the issue, instead stating:\n“[T]he rule is too well established to need discussion here. This being an action for an\ninjunction, neither the constitution nor the statute requires the submission of the issues to a\njury. It is not error to deny a jury in any case where such right was not granted at common\nlaw. [Citations.]” (McCaddon, at p. 792.) Not one of the citations in the court’s string cite\nwas to a public nuisance case.\n\n\n\n                                               87\n\f       Numerous Court of Appeal cases have stated that there is no right to a jury trial in a\npublic nuisance action by the government seeking only abatement. For example, People v.\nFrangadakis (1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 540 (Frangadakis) was an action by the government to\nabate a public nuisance in which the defendants contended on appeal that they had been\ndeprived of their constitutional right to a jury trial. The Court of Appeal, citing One 1941,\nrejected their contention without substantive analysis. (Frangadakis, at pp. 543, 545-546.)\nPeople v. Englebrecht (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1236 (Englebrecht) did the same.\n(Englebrecht, at p. 1245.)\n       There is no binding California Supreme Court holding on the issue of whether a jury\ntrial is required in a representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only a\nremedial abatement order. This issue is “ ‘ “a purely historical question, a fact which is to be\nascertained like any other social, political or legal fact.” [Citations.]’ ” (Franchise Tax Bd.\nv. Superior Court, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1010.) Defendants have failed to show that the\ntrial court erred in finding that there was not a right to a jury trial under the common law in\n1850 in a representative public nuisance action brought by the government seeking solely a\nremedial abatement order. The historical materials upon which defendants rely reflect that\nrepresentative public nuisance cases brought by the government seeking only remedial\nabatement orders were not exclusively tried in common law courts but could be resolved in\nequity courts by the Chancellors. None of the cases from the 19th century involved a cause\nof action closely analogous to the representative public nuisance cause of action seeking\nonly remedial abatement brought by plaintiff in this action. Given this historical record, we\nmust reject their contention that they were deprived of their right to a jury trial.\n\n\n                                     H. Abatement Fund\n       Defendants contend that the trial court’s abatement order was invalid because it was\nactually an order that they pay damages.\n\n\n\n                                               88\n\f       The trial court’s statement of decision required “abatement through the establishment\nof a fund, in the name of the People, dedicated to abating the public nuisance” that would\n“be administered by the State of California,” unless the State was “unwilling or unable” to\ndo so, in which case the 10 jurisdictions would serve as receivers and administrators of the\nfund. “Payments into the fund shall be deposited into an account established in the name of\nthe People and disbursed by the [CLPPB] on behalf of the People.” “The Defendants\nagainst whom judgment is entered, jointly and severally, shall pay to the People of the State\nof California, in a manner consistent with California law, $1,150,000,000 (One Billion One\nHundred Fifty Million Dollars) into a specifically designated, dedicated, and restricted\nabatement fund (the ‘Fund’) [¶] . . . within 60 days of entry of judgment.” The funds will be\ndisbursed to the 10 jurisdictions to pay for remediation in accordance with the abatement\nplan. “The [remediation] program shall last for four years from the date of total payment by\ndefendants into the Fund. If, at the end of four years, any funds remain, those monies shall\nbe returned to the paying defendants in the ratio by which the program was initially funded.\nThe Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, shall have continuing jurisdiction\nover the Plan and its implementation.”\n       Defendants assert that “[t]he [abatement] Plan is nothing more than a thinly-\ndisguised damages award to Plaintiffs for unattributed past harm to private homes over\nwhich Defendants have no control.”\n       “An abatement of a nuisance is accomplished by a court of equity by means of an\ninjunction proper and suitable to the facts of each case.” (Sullivan, supra, 72 Cal. at p. 249.)\n“ ‘[T]he granting, denial, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve a permanent or preliminary\ninjunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court upon a consideration of all the\nparticular circumstances of each individual case.’ [Citation] Such an order will not be\nmodified or dissolved on appeal except for an abuse of discretion.” (Union Interchange,\nInc. v. Savage (1959) 52 Cal.2d 601, 606.)\n\n\n\n                                               89\n\f         A public entity may not recover in a representative public nuisance action any funds\nthat it has already expended to remediate a public nuisance. This court acknowledged as\nmuch in Santa Clara I. (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 310.) The trial court’s\nabatement order in this case did not attempt to award any already-incurred costs to plaintiff\nor to any of the 10 jurisdictions. Instead, the court’s abatement order directed defendants to\ndeposit funds in an abatement fund, which would be utilized to prospectively fund\nremediation of the public nuisance. None of these funds were permitted to be utilized to\nreimburse plaintiff, any of the 10 jurisdictions, or any homeowners for already-incurred\ncosts.\n         The abatement fund was not a “thinly-disguised” damages award. The distinction\nbetween an abatement order and a damages award is stark. An abatement order is an\nequitable remedy, while damages are a legal remedy. An equitable remedy’s sole purpose\nis to eliminate the hazard that is causing prospective harm to the plaintiff. An equitable\nremedy provides no compensation to a plaintiff for prior harm. Damages, on the other\nhand, are directed at compensating the plaintiff for prior accrued harm that has resulted\nfrom the defendant’s wrongful conduct. The distinction between these two types of\nremedies frequently arises in nuisance actions. Generally, continuing nuisances are subject\nto abatement, and permanent nuisances are subject to actions for damages. (Baker v.\nBurbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority (1985) 39 Cal.3d 862, 868-870.) As Code\nof Civil Procedure section 731 permits a public entity plaintiff to seek abatement of a public\nnuisance in a representative action, the trial court could properly order abatement as a\nremedy in this case.\n         Here, plaintiff sought the equitable remedy of abatement for the nuisance because the\nhazard created by defendants was continuing to cause harm to children, and that harm could\nbe prevented only by removing the hazard. Plaintiff did not seek to recover for any prior\naccrued harm nor did it seek compensation of any kind. The deposits that the trial court\nrequired defendants to make into the abatement account would be utilized not to\n\n                                               90\n\frecompense anyone for accrued harm but solely to pay for the prospective removal of the\nhazards defendants had created. Furthermore, any funds that had not been utilized for that\nsole purpose by the end of the four-year abatement period were to be returned to defendants.\nWhile the trial court did require defendants to make deposits into the account to provide the\nfunds necessary to carry out the abatement, the court’s estimate of the amount that would be\nnecessary for that purpose was just that: an estimate. The trial court could have chosen to\nhave defendants handle the remediation themselves, but such an order would have been\ndifficult for the court to oversee and for defendants to undertake. The court’s reasonable\ndecision to create a remediation fund overseen by a knowledgeable receiver, and ultimately\nby the court, was not an abuse of discretion under the specific circumstances of this case.\n       Because the trial court’s abatement order did not require defendants to reimburse\nanyone for already incurred costs, defendants’ reliance on County of San Luis Obispo v.\nAbalone Alliance (1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 848 (Abalone), which this court cited in Santa\nClara I, is misplaced. In Abalone, the county sought to recover $700,000 in costs that it had\nincurred as a result of the defendants’ “blockade . . . .” (Abalone, at p. 859.) The Court of\nAppeal rejected the county’s attempt to characterize these already incurred costs as “costs of\nabatement” so that they could be recovered in a public nuisance abatement action.\n(Abalone, at pp. 859-860.) As the court pointed out, these already-incurred costs were\n“damages,” and therefore not recoverable by a public entity in a public nuisance abatement\naction. (Abalone, at pp. 859-861.)\n       The distinction between an abatement fund and damages was recognized by the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Price (3d Cir. 1982) 688 F.2d 204\n(Price). Price was an appeal from the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction in a\ncase where the defendants were alleged to be responsible for contaminating a city’s water\nsupply. While the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s exercise of its discretion to\ndeny preliminary relief, it pointed out that the district court had taken an “unduly restrictive\nview of its remedial powers . . . .” (Price, at p. 211.) “Damages are awarded as a form of\n\n                                               91\n\fsubstitutional redress. They are intended to compensate a party for an injury suffered or\nother loss. A request for funds for a diagnostic study of the public health threat posed by\nthe continuing contamination and its abatement is not, in any sense, a traditional form of\ndamages. The funding of a diagnostic study in the present case, though it would require\nmonetary payments, would be preventive rather than compensatory. The study is intended\nto be the first step in the remedial process of abating an existing but growing toxic hazard\nwhich, if left unchecked, will result in even graver future injury, i.e., the contamination of\nAtlantic City’s water supply.” (Price, at p. 212.)\n       While the trial court’s order in this case may be unusual in requiring defendants to\nprefund remediation costs, it was well within the court’s discretion. The California\nSupreme Court presciently noted in Santa Clara II that “[t]his case will result, at most, in\ndefendants’ having to expend resources to abate the lead-paint nuisance they allegedly\ncreated, either by paying into a fund dedicated to that abatement purpose or by undertaking\nthe abatement themselves.” (Santa Clara II, supra, 50 Cal.4th at pp. 55-56, italics added.)\nThe abatement fund ordered by the trial court was a reasonable method of prefunding the\nremediation that is required to abate the public nuisance created by defendants. The choice\nof this method was not an abuse of the court’s broad discretion to fashion an appropriate\nabatement injunction.\n       Defendants briefly complain that the trial court erred “by ordering defendants to pay\ninto a plan that provides no judicial oversight, and no mechanism for return of unused funds\nto defendants.” We see no such flaws in the court’s order. The court expressly provided\nthat it would retain jurisdiction “over the Plan and its implementation.” And it explicitly\nordered, “If, at the end of four years, any funds remain, those monies shall be returned to the\npaying defendants in the ratio by which the program was initially funded.” Thus, there is no\nbasis for defendant’s complaints.\n       There is also no merit to defendants’ claim that the abatement fund will somehow be\n“placed into the State treasury . . . .” The trial court’s order explicitly required defendants to\n\n                                               92\n\fdeposit funds into “a specifically designated, dedicated, and restricted abatement fund.” It\nplainly did not require, contemplate, or permit the deposit of those funds into “the State\ntreasury . . . .”\n\n\n                                               I. Laches\n          ConAgra contends that plaintiff’s public nuisance cause of action was barred by\n          61\nlaches.        Plaintiff asserts that laches was not an available defense to its public nuisance\nabatement cause of action. The trial court expressly rejected ConAgra’s laches contention\nin its statement of decision, but ConAgra contends that it is raising solely a legal issue upon\nwhich we exercise independent review. Although a trial court’s decision on a laches issue\nis ordinarily subject to deferential review, the issue of whether laches is a legally available\ndefense is a legal issue subject to de novo review. (City and County of San Francisco v.\nBallard (2006) 136 Cal.App.4th 381, 392.)\n          Civil Code section 3490 expressly provides that “[n]o lapse of time can legalize a\npublic nuisance, amounting to an actual obstruction of public right.” (Civ. Code, § 3490.)\nConAgra claims that this statute does not apply because interior residential lead paint does\nnot actually obstruct any public right. As we have already explained, plaintiff established\nthat pervasive interior residential lead paint in the housing stock of the 10 jurisdictions\nobstructs the public right to safe housing. An obstruction is something that impedes or\nhinders. (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1993) p. 803.) Interior residential\nlead paint “actual[ly]” impedes or hinders the public right to safe housing because it renders\nunsafe for young children a large amount of residential housing in the 10 jurisdictions. We\n\n\n61\n       Although defendants generally join each other’s contentions, ConAgra’s laches\nargument is premised on facts concerning only itself. NL makes no mention of laches in its\nbriefs. SWC makes only the briefest mention of laches in its opening brief. Because NL\nand SWC have chosen not to argue this issue as to their particular facts, and ConAgra’s\ncontention is premised on facts applicable only to itself, we discuss this issue solely as it\napplies to ConAgra.\n                                                   93\n\freject ConAgra’s claim that interior residential lead paint does not amount to an actual\nobstruction of a public right.\n       ConAgra also claims that Civil Code section 3490 does not apply here because it is\nnot seeking to “legalize” any continuing conduct, such as putting lead paint in residential\nhousing. Nowhere in the text of Civil Code section 3490 do we discern any indication that\nit is limited to continuing conduct. Legalize means to “make legal,” and “legal” means\n“conforming to” the law. (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1993) p. 664.)\nPublic nuisances are criminal. (Pen. Code, § 372.) The public nuisance created by\ndefendants is not “conforming to” the law, and permitting defendants to avoid responsibility\nfor abating this public nuisance would allow this unlawful public nuisance to continue to\nexist. Under these circumstances, Civil Code section 3490 does apply, and any “lapse of\ntime” does not preclude plaintiff’s action to abate the unlawful public nuisance created by\ndefendants.\n       ConAgra further asserts that “public policy” supports the application of laches in this\ncase. “ ‘Laches is an equitable defense based on the principle that those who neglect their\nrights may be barred from obtaining relief in equity. [Citation.]’ ” (Feduniak v. California\nCoastal Com. (2007) 148 Cal.App.4th 1346, 1381, italics added.) “It is clear, however, that\nneither the doctrine of estoppel nor any other equitable principle may be invoked against a\ngovernmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy\nadopted to protect the public.” (County of San Diego v. California Water & Tel. Co. (1947)\n30 Cal.2d 817, 826, italics added.)\n       Since laches is an equitable defense, it could not be asserted against the government,\neven if it were not barred by Civil Code section 3490, because such an application would\ndefeat a public policy aimed at protecting the public. Civil Code section 3479 is an\nexpression of the Legislature’s public policy against public nuisances, and it is plainly\naimed at protecting the public from the hazards created by public nuisances.\n\n\n\n                                              94\n\f       Given these conclusions, we need not consider ConAgra’s extended and irrelevant\nargument that the public nuisance it assisted in creating was permanent rather than\ncontinuing. The trial court did not err in rejecting ConAgra’s laches defense.\n\n\n                           J. Procedural and Evidentiary Issues\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in (1) admitting hearsay documents,\npermitting experts to testify about hearsay documents, and considering limited purpose\nhearsay documents for their truth; (2) making a blanket ruling disallowing recross-\nexamination; (3) imposing time limits and rejecting offers of proof and deposition\ndesignations; (4) changing the relevant product from white lead to lead paint during trial;\n(5) not allowing defendants adequate time to analyze the “RASSCLE” database, which was\nnot fully provided to defendants until three weeks before trial; (6) not allowing defendants\n                                                                                                 62\nto inspect specific properties; and (7) not sanctioning plaintiff for spoliation of evidence.\n                                   1. Hearsay Documents\n       Defendants claim that the trial court prejudicially erred in (1) admitting hearsay\ndocuments into evidence under Evidence Code section 1280 that did not meet that statute’s\nrequirements, (2) permitting plaintiff’s expert historians to give opinion testimony based on\nhearsay documents that were not admitted into evidence at trial or were admitted only for a\nlimited purpose, (3) permitting plaintiff’s experts to quote those limited purpose documents\n                                                                                            63\nwhile testifying, and (4) considering limited purpose hearsay documents for their truth.\n\n\n62\n      The trial court advised the parties before trial that an objection by one defendant\nwould be “applicable to” all defendants. The court reiterated this at trial. Hence, we\nanalyze these contentions as to all defendants even if only one of them objected at trial.\n63\n       Defendants’ appellate briefing makes it difficult if not impossible to determine\nprecisely which trial court rulings on defense objections are being challenged on appeal.\nFor instance, ConAgra refers in its brief to some testimony by plaintiff’s expert Markowitz.\nDefendants did not interject any hearsay objections to the testimony of Markowitz to which\nthey refer. At one point, during Markowitz’s testimony, ConAgra’s trial counsel asked the\ncourt whether a Fuller brochure was being admitted for a limited purpose, and the court\n                                               95\n\f                              a. Evidence Code section 1280\n                                       i. Background\n       Near the beginning of trial, defendants submitted a “Memorandum Regarding\nAdmissibility of Scientific and Government Publications.” (Most capitalization omitted.)\nThis memorandum addressed potential exhibits described as “reports and surveys from\nfederal agencies and committees” and a single article from a medical journal. Defendants\nasserted that these documents would not qualify for admission under Evidence Code section\n1280 because they were “not limited to public employees’ records of an act, condition, or\nevent, nor were they written at or near the time of such an act, condition, or event.” They\nalso asserted that plaintiff’s experts could not testify about the contents of these documents\nother than to say that they had relied on them.\n       The trial court did not view this memorandum as an objection to anything: “It is not\nframed as a motion. It is not framed as an objection to testimony. I wasn’t clear what it\nwas supposed to be other than trying to educate me about some legal principles.”\nDefendants explained that they were providing “our explanation for those objections in\nadvance,” and they then objected on hearsay and relevance grounds to plaintiff’s expert\nhistorian Mushak “reading from and potentially offering” “scientific journals and\n\n\nconfirmed that it was. He made no objection. Hence, defendants did not preserve a hearsay\nobjection to this testimony.\n        Defendants cite a written objection that ConAgra filed, objecting to any testimony by\nplaintiff’s expert historian Rosner that Fuller’s promotion of lead paint had “caused” lead\npaint to be present on residences in the 10 jurisdictions. It claimed that Rosner was not\nqualified to offer such testimony and lacked any reliable basis for such testimony. These\nwritten objections did not interject any hearsay objections or relate to the contentions that\ndefendants make on appeal. Defendants cite a defense objection, not on hearsay grounds, to\nthe admission of an exhibit regarding ConAgra’s liability as the successor to Fuller. And\nthey cite ConAgra’s objection on “no foundation and Evidence Code sections 802 and 803”\ngrounds to any testimony by plaintiff’s expert Markowitz that Fuller had knowledge of the\ndangers of lead when it was promoting it. Although the court overruled these objections,\nthere is no apparent relationship between that ruling and defendants’ evidentiary contentions\non appeal.\n                                              96\n\fgovernment reports.” The court noted that Mushak was testifying as an expert and therefore\ncould rely on inadmissible hearsay to support his opinion testimony. It also observed that\n“reports and analysis” that were not admitted for their truth but solely to allow the court to\nevaluate the expert’s testimony could be received into evidence. The court ruled that\n“expert witnesses testifying in this case as a general matter can rely on reports, information,\nwhich might otherwise be designated inadmissible as hearsay.”\n       Defendants clarified that their objection was to the admission of the documents, not\nthe expert’s reliance on hearsay. The trial court reiterated that any hearsay documents relied\non by the experts would not be admitted for their truth but only to evaluate the expert’s\ntestimony. The court subsequently ruled: “First of all, if the documents that are being\nproffered are the product of a public agency, they will be admitted as an exception to the\nhearsay rule under Evidence Code Section 1280. That’s a general proposition I don’t think\nanyone can argue with. Experts who are testifying and who are relying on reports, analysis,\nand so forth, not prepared by themselves but, say, statistical analysis or something like that,\nthose materials can come into evidence for a limited purpose to assist the Court in\nevaluating the expert’s opinion.” No defendant challenged at that time the court’s statement\nthat “documents that . . . are the product of a public agency” are admissible under Evidence\nCode section 1280.\n       Defendants subsequently objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of a 2012\n“monograph” prepared by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) addressing the health\neffects of low-level lead exposure. This monograph was introduced during the testimony of\none of the experts who had helped write it. The court ruled that this document was\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1280. Defendants also objected on hearsay\ngrounds to the admission of a Mineral Resources Yearbook for the year 1922 that had been\nprepared and published by the United States Department of the Interior in 1925. This\ndocument contained statistics for the production and consumption of lead in the United\n\n\n\n                                              97\n\fStates from 1917 to 1922 and a list of the companies that were producing white lead in\n1922, which included Fuller, NL, and SWC.\n                                          ii. Analysis\n       “Evidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made\ninadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in any civil or criminal proceeding to prove\nthe act, condition, or event if all of the following applies: [¶] (a) The writing was made by\nand within the scope of duty of a public employee. [¶] (b) The writing was made at or near\nthe time of the act, condition, or event. [¶] (c) The sources of information and method and\ntime of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.” (Evid. Code, § 1280.) “A\ntrial court has broad discretion in determining whether a party has established these\nfoundational requirements. [Citation.] Its ruling on admissibility ‘implies whatever finding\nof fact is prerequisite thereto . . . . [Citation.]’ [Citation.] A reviewing court may overturn\nthe trial court’s exercise of discretion ‘ “only upon a clear showing of abuse.” ’ ” (People v.\nMartinez (2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 120.)\n       We can see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s finding that the monograph and\nthe mineral yearbook fell within the parameters of Evidence Code section 1280. Both of\nthese documents demonstrated on their face that they had been prepared by public\nemployees in the scope of their employment. The monograph described an NIH study that\nhad been recently completed and had been extensively peer reviewed, so the trial court\ncould have reasonably concluded that it was a writing made “at or near” the time of the\nstudy and had been prepared using sources and methods that were trustworthy. The mineral\nyearbook was prepared by the Department of the Interior to report on mineral production\nand consumption during what were no doubt the most recent years for which it had\ninformation. The trial court could reasonably conclude that the Department of the Interior\nused trustworthy sources to compile this information.\n       Defendants do not argue the Evidence Code section 1280 issue as to any other\nexhibits except for a summary reference in a footnote to exhibits 8, 17, 19, and 253 as\n\n                                               98\n\fexamples of documents that were admitted into evidence by the trial court over hearsay\nobjections under Evidence Code section 1280. Defendants provide no further detail about\nthese four exhibits, and they do not even provide record citations for the exhibits themselves\nor the rulings on their admission. Instead, they support their claim that these four exhibits\nwere admitted into evidence over hearsay objections with a citation to the court’s general\nunchallenged ruling that “documents that . . . are the product of a public agency” would be\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1280.\n       Despite defendants’ inadequate briefing, we briefly consider the propriety of the\nadmission of these four exhibits. Exhibit 8 is a transcript of a 1910 hearing before a\nCongressional committee. When it was admitted into evidence, the only defense objection\nwas “[c]ontinuing objections,” which the court overruled while citing Evidence Code\nsection 1280. Defendants made no express hearsay objection to the admission of this\nexhibit, and they submit no argument on appeal as to why this official transcript of a\nlegislative hearing was not admissible under Evidence Code section 1280. In any case, we\ncan see no abuse of discretion in the court’s determination that this official transcript was\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1280. Exhibit 17 is a 2013 CDC “Weekly\nReport,” and one of plaintiff’s experts testified that the CDC published such reports every\nweek. Exhibit 19 is a 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) booklet on childhood lead\npoisoning that was prepared in part by one of plaintiff’s expert witnesses. When these two\nexhibits were admitted into evidence, the defense objected “under 1280 because it is not a\nrecord of an act, condition, or event.” The court overruled the objections. Again,\ndefendants do not detail on appeal why these exhibits did not qualify for admission under\nEvidence Code section 1280. However, we can discern no abuse of discretion in the trial\ncourt’s overruling of the objection. Both exhibits appear to be timely official records of\nconditions.\n       Exhibit 253 is a resolution of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors declaring\nNational Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week in 2012. When this document was\n\n                                              99\n\fmentioned by a witness at trial, the defense objected on “foundation” grounds and because it\nwas “unsigned.” Although the court admitted the document “for all purposes,” it also said\nthat it would “take it in for whatever it is worth” as a “resolution of the Board of\nSupervisors.” The only testimony about this document was that it showed that “[t]he Board\nis basically recognizing that childhood lead poisoning is a significant health issue in Santa\nClara County . . . .” This was not a disputed issue. Defendant makes no argument on\nappeal about how it could have been prejudiced by the admission of this document, and it is\ninconceivable that this document was considered for the truth of any of its recitals. Any\nerror in admitting it “for all purposes” was not prejudicial.\n      b. Expert Testimony Based on Hearsay Documents Not Admitted At Trial\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in permitting experts to testify “based on\nhearsay documents that were described at trial but which were, in many instances, never\nadmitted into evidence.” With one exception, none of the record citations that defendants\nprovide to support this contention contains any objection to expert testimony about hearsay\ndocuments that were not admitted into evidence. Instead, the record citations they provide\nin support of this contention are to testimony based on documents that were admitted into\nevidence.\n       The one exception is the following exchange: “Q [by plaintiff’s trial counsel].\nOkay. And, Dr. Markowitz, we have only touched on a handful of documents from either\nthe Lead Industries Association or the National Paint, Varnish, and Lacquer Association\nhere. Are these documents representative of other types of documents that you have seen in\nyour much more extensive research and review of hundreds of thousands of pages of\ndocuments? [¶] MR. GLYNN [DuPont’s trial counsel]: I think that’s improper to now\nbring in a host of undisclosed and undescribed documents. He can testify as to what he has\nbrought to court, not something -- [¶] THE COURT: I get it. You can shorten the\nobjection. The objection is overruled. It is what it is.” Markowitz responded: “Yes.\nThese are representative of many other documents.” Defendants provide in support of this\n\n                                              100\n\fargument no other record citation to any instance of an overruled defense objection to an\n                                                    64\nexpert testifying about an unadmitted document.          As the trial court’s alleged error in\noverruling this objection resulted only in Markowitz’s response to this one question, which\nwas not prejudicial, we reject this contention.\n     c. Permitting Experts to Read Limited Purpose Hearsay Documents Into Record\n        Defendants assert that the court prejudicially erred in permitting experts to read into\nthe record hearsay in documents that had been admitted for a limited purpose. The string of\nrecord citations that defendants provide to support this assertion, which they make without\nsubstantive analysis, primarily demonstrates that the court expressly ruled that the hearsay\nin these documents was being admitted only for a limited purpose. Defendants’ objections\n                                                                                 65\nwere primarily limited to hearsay objections to the documents themselves.\n        However, defendants did make a relevant objection at one point. The defense\nobjected on hearsay grounds to the admission of 1937 and 1939 LIA and NPVLA\ndocuments and a 1930 newspaper article referenced in the LIA documents. The court\nadmitted these documents for the limited purpose of evaluating the expert’s opinion\n\n\n\n64\n       We do note one other similar occurrence. “Q [by plaintiff’s trial counsel]. Were\nthese opinions informed by other documents that you reviewed in [the] historical record?\n[¶] A [by plaintiff’s expert Rosner]. Yes, certainly. [¶] Q. And are the documents you\npresented to the Court as the basis of your expert opinion, representations of what you have\nseen in other documents as well? [¶] A. Yes. [¶] MR. STERN [ARCO’s trial counsel]:\nObjection, your Honor. Without specific discussion of those documents. [¶] THE\nCOURT: Overruled. [¶] THE WITNESS: Yes.” The trial court’s alleged error in\noverruling this objection also was not prejudicial.\n65\n        For instance, the defense objected, apparently on hearsay grounds, to the admission\nof an 1878 medical journal article, and the court ruled that the evidence would be admitted\nfor the limited purpose of evaluating the expert’s opinion. In response to plaintiff’s\nargument for unlimited admission, the court held open the possibility that this article might\nbe admissible to show “notice” if plaintiff produced evidence that a defendant was aware of\nit. ConAgra objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of a 1919 newspaper article\nabout Fuller’s South San Francisco plant. The court ruled that the article was admissible for\na limited purpose.\n                                              101\n\ftestimony, and it permitted the defense to enter a “continuing objection to purported opinion\ntestimony that is based solely on information gleaned from the four corners of the document\n                      66\nbeing referred to.”        Plaintiff’s experts thereafter referenced specific portions of these\ndocuments in their testimony.\n       “If statements related by experts as bases for their opinions are not admitted for their\ntruth, they are not hearsay.” (People v. Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 681.) “When an\nexpert relies on hearsay to provide case-specific facts, considers the statements as true, and\nrelates them to the [factfinder] as a reliable basis for the expert’s opinion, it cannot logically\nbe asserted that the hearsay content is not offered for its truth.” (Id. at p. 682.) “When an\nexpert is not testifying in the form of a proper hypothetical question and no other evidence\nof the case-specific facts presented has or will be admitted, there is no denying that such\nfacts are being considered by the expert, and offered to the [factfinder], as true.” (Id. at\np. 684.) “If an expert testifies to case-specific out-of-court statements to explain the bases\nfor his opinion, those statements are necessarily considered by the jury for their truth, thus\nrendering them hearsay. Like any other hearsay evidence, it must be properly admitted\nthrough an applicable hearsay exception.” (Ibid.) “What an expert cannot do is relate as\ntrue case-specific facts asserted in hearsay statements, unless they are independently proven\nby competent evidence or are covered by a hearsay exception.” (Id. at p. 686.)\n       The trial court did not err in permitting the experts to testify about the specific\nstatements in these documents that supported their opinions. First, the record does not\nestablish that these documents were not within a hearsay exception. As plaintiff established\nbelow, these documents were more than 30 years old. “Evidence of a statement is not made\ninadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is contained in a writing more than 30\nyears old and the statement has been since generally acted upon as true by persons having\n\n\n66\n       There is no indication that the trial court or the parties viewed this “continuing\nobjection” as applying to documents other than the LIA and NPVLA documents and the\n1930 newspaper article.\n                                                   102\n\fan interest in the matter.” (Evid. Code, § 1331.) “Ancient documents would have no effect\nor potency as evidence unless they served to import verity to the facts written therein. The\ntrue rule is that an ancient document is admitted in evidence as proof of the facts recited\ntherein, provided the writer would have been competent to testify as to such facts.”\n(Kirkpatrick v. Tapo Oil Co. (1956) 144 Cal.App.2d 404, 411.) Since the authors of the\nLIA and NPVLA documents and the writer of the newspaper article would likely have been\ncompetent to testify to the contents of these writings, and the members of the LIA and the\nNPVLA would have acted upon the statements in these documents being true, defendants\nhave not established that these documents were inadmissible hearsay.\n       Second, the experts were not necessarily relying on the truth of the statements in\nthese documents since their relevance was primarily to show what defendants were aware of\nat the relevant time. Finally, the trial court, which admitted these documents for a limited\npurpose, was well aware of the nature of the limited admissibility of these documents and,\nunlike lay jurors, able to distinguish between the use of the contents for their truth and the\n                                                           67\nuse of the documents as a basis for an expert’s opinion.        We find no prejudicial error in the\ncourt’s rulings with regard to the experts’ references to these documents.\n                 d. Reliance on Hearsay in Limited Purpose Documents\n       Defendants argue that the trial court prejudicially erred in considering for its truth\nhearsay in documents that had been admitted only for a limited purpose. Defendants have\nforfeited this contention because they fail to cite any indication in the record that the trial\ncourt relied on a limited purpose exhibit for the truth of its assertions. The only exhibits\nthey expressly reference are exhibits 18 and 19, which were admitted for all purposes under\nEvidence Code section 1280 and therefore were not limited purpose documents.\n\n\n\n\n67\n      The court stated early on: “[T]hese matters, these reports, analyses, whatever they\nmight be, if they are hearsay are not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but they\nare admitted for the limited purpose to assist me in evaluating the expert’s opinion.”\n                                               103\n\f                                   2. Disallowance of Recross\n       Defendants contend that the trial court prejudicially erred in ruling that there would\nbe no recross-examination during the trial.\n                                        a. Background\n       After redirect of the first trial witness, one of the defense attorneys asked to recross.\nThe court said: “No. No. One round. Direct, cross, redirect. That’s it.” After plaintiff’s\nexpert Rosner testified on redirect, trial counsel for ARCO and DuPont requested recross.\nThe court denied the request. ConAgra’s trial counsel objected to the denial of recross. “If\nthe Court please, I too would like to do a brief recross-examination. May I please have a\ncontinuing objection to the denial of rights under 772 as to any witness where I actually\nparticipated in the cross-examination at issue.” The court allowed him a continuing\nobjection and overruled his objection. SWC’s trial counsel joined ConAgra’s objection\nNL’s trial counsel did not join.\n       After redirect of plaintiff’s expert industrial hygienist Gottesfeld, who had testified\nabout lead inspections and lead assessments, SWC’s trial counsel moved to “strike the\nredirect testimony in light of the denial of recross.” The court denied the motion. It stated:\n“I think the Court has the discretion to alter the order of this. You might want to take a look\nat Evidence Code Section 320. There is some case law about that as well. In any event, I\nthink I am within my province to do that.”\n       After plaintiff’s witness Courtney testified on redirect, SWC’s attorney asked to be\npermitted to “ask two questions as my redirect,” but the court denied the request. SWC had\ndone its direct exam as its cross to save time.\n       During redirect of plaintiff’s expert Markowitz, plaintiff introduced additional\nexhibits. SWC’s trial counsel objected: “[W]ith no chance to cross-examination [sic], they\nchose to proceed by summary. If they botched it, they shouldn’t be able to drop this on us\nafter cross. Your Honor, I object. If they are allowed, I would like an opportunity to study\nthem and have this witness subject to recall so I can cross-examine them fairly and deal\n\n                                              104\n\fwith them later. That’s my objection.” The court overruled the objection. After\nMarkowitz’s redirect, DuPont’s trial counsel asked the court if it would “permit brief\nrecross.” The court said “No.” No other attorney sought recross of Markowitz.\n       After redirect of plaintiff’s final expert witness, SWC’s trial counsel said: “I am\nassuming that your Honor’s standing rule of no recross applies, and we don’t have to ask for\nrecross each time?” The court said: “That is correct.” SWC’s trial counsel then sought to\nstrike the witness’s testimony about an article because he would not have the opportunity to\nask about it on recross. His request was denied.\n       At the close of plaintiff’s case, SWC’s trial counsel moved “to strike the testimony\non redirect for all of the witnesses on the ground we were not permitted recross.” The\nmotion was denied.\n                                         b. Analysis\n       Defendants claim that the trial court’s disallowance of all recross throughout the trial\nwas an arbitrary ruling that cannot be upheld as an exercise of discretion because it allowed\nplaintiff to present evidence on redirect that defendants had no opportunity to confront.\n       “A witness examined by one party may be cross-examined upon any matter within\nthe scope of the direct examination by each other party to the action in such order as the\ncourt directs.” (Evid. Code, § 773, subd. (a).) “ ‘Recross-examination’ is an examination of\na witness by a cross-examiner subsequent to a redirect examination of the witness.” (Evid.\nCode, § 763.) “The examination of a witness shall proceed in the following phases: direct\nexamination, cross-examination, redirect examination, recross-examination, and continuing\nthereafter by redirect and recross-examination.” (Evid. Code, § 772, subd. (a).)\n       Defendants contend that Evidence Code sections 772 and 763 create a right to\nrecross. Neither statute creates any rights. Evidence Code section 763 merely defines\nrecross, and Evidence Code section 772 simply identifies the order in which the various\nphases of witness examination, including recross, may occur. If defendants’ contention\nwere accurate, Evidence Code section 772’s mention of re-redirect and re-recross would\n\n                                             105\n\fcreate a right to those uncommon phases of witness examination. Defendants cite no\nauthority for the proposition that Evidence Code section 772 has ever been construed to\ncreate a right to every possible phase of witness examination.\n       Defendants cite an appellate court decision from Illinois for the proposition that a\n                                                       68\nblanket prohibition on recross is never permissible.        In Grundy County Nat. Bank v. Myre\n(1975) 34 Ill.App.3d 287 (Grundy), a bank brought an action to collect from a farmer on an\naccounts receivable that had been assigned to the bank by a farm supply company. (Ibid.)\nThe farmer claimed that the account was overstated by $18,500, which was attributable to a\nnote that the farm supply company had assigned to one of its suppliers and the farmer had\npaid off. The trial court rejected the farmer’s claim that the account was overstated and\nawarded the bank over $30,000. On appeal, the farmer contended that the trial court had\nprejudicially erred in refusing to allow him recross of one of the bank’s witnesses. (Grundy,\nat pp. 287-288.) On direct exam, the witness acknowledged that $18,500 for a carload of a\nparticular type of fertilizer was supposed to be billed to the farmer by the supplier and was\nthe subject of the note. On cross, the witness admitted that he could not tell if that fertilizer\nhad instead been charged to the farmer’s account by the supply company and said that the\nfertilizer was just part of the goods covered by the $18,500 note. On redirect, the witness\ntestified that one of the ledger cards for the farmer’s account showed no fertilizer purchases\nthat could have amounted to a carload or to $18,500. The farmer was denied the\nopportunity for recross. In fact, another ledger card in evidence at the trial showed that\nmore than $20,000 had been charged to the farmer’s account for a carload of that particular\ntype of fertilizer. (Grundy, at pp. 288-289.) Under these circumstances, the Illinois\n\n\n68\n        Defendants’ reliance on a federal Confrontation Clause case is misplaced as the\nConfrontation Clause does not apply in civil cases. (United States v. Baker (9th Cir. 1993)\n10 F.3d 1374, 1404 [Confrontation Clause permits recross to be barred except where “new\nmatter” was introduced on redirect], overruled on a different point in United States v\nNordby (9th Cir. 2000) 225 F.3d 1053, 1059.) The remainder of the cases defendants cite\nare irrelevant because they concerned the right to cross-examination, not the right to recross.\n                                               106\n\fappellate court held that, “[s]ince new matter had been brought out on redirect, and since the\nrefusal to permit recross was clearly prejudicial to defendant’s case, the ruling amounted to\nreversible error.” (Grundy, at p. 290.)\n       Grundy is readily distinguishable. Here, unlike in Grundy, the trial court announced\nat the beginning of the trial that there would be no recross permitted throughout the trial.\nBy making this ruling at the outset, the trial court let trial counsel know that it was their job\nto avoid the need for recross by objecting to any redirect that exceeded the scope of cross.\nThe scope of direct operates as a limit on cross, and the scope of cross in turn limits\nredirect. Even without an opportunity for recross, the cross examiner has a full opportunity\nto address everything that the direct examiner has addressed on direct, and any redirect\ncannot properly delve into new subject matter. In fact, trial counsel for the defense actively\ninterposed objections to the scope of redirect. Some of those objections were sustained, and\nothers were overruled, but defendants do not contend on appeal that the trial court\nprejudicially erred in overruling their specific beyond-the-scope objections.\n       We can see no abuse of discretion in a trial court’s decision that a particular court\ntrial should be conducted without recross. In a court trial, the trial court, as the factfinder,\ncan discern whether the material to be presented is of a type that does not merit repetitive\nexamination of witnesses. In this case, with half a dozen litigants, more than a dozen trial\nattorneys, and predominantly expert witnesses who had been heavily deposed in advance of\ntrial, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that repetitive witness examination\nwould be unduly burdensome and unproductive. Requiring trial counsel to police the scope\nof redirect so as to avoid the need for recross was a reasonable choice for the trial court to\nmake in this case to avoid an undue consumption of the court’s time and resources. The\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting recross at this trial.\n                                          3. Time Limits\n       Defendants challenge the trial court’s imposition of time limits and rejection of their\nposttrial deposition designations and offers of proof.\n\n                                                107\n\f                                             a. Background\n       The parties initially estimated that the trial would last two months. Two months\nbefore trial, the court told the parties that it would allow each side 30 hours to present its\ncase. Defendants objected to this time limit. The court clarified that this limit applied only\nto “witness time” and that a party could seek more time if it could provide a “specific\n                  69\njustification.”        The court told the parties that it anticipated that the case would be tried\nover a one-month period. The parties were ordered “to exchange exhibit lists and the\ncontent and expected testimony time of each witness” and to provide to the court “a list of\nproposed exhibits that are actually intended to be used and witnesses (including a brief\nsummary of testimony and realistic time estimates) . . . .”\n       On June 24, 2013, three weeks before trial, the court went over the lists of witnesses\nand time estimates that the parties had provided. Plaintiff’s time estimate was within the\ncourt’s 30-hour allotment. The defense estimated that it would need 64.25 hours to present\nits case. The court was not satisfied. “The Defendants have to get the number down from\nthe amount of time that they have stated. I am not going to pick a precise number. But to\nget me above the 30 hours is going to take a lot, a lot, to get over that. And just a list of\nnames is not going to do it.”\n       On July 8, 2013, a week before trial, the court informed the parties that, “within\nreason,” deposition testimony would not be counted against the 30-hour limit because the\ncourt could read deposition testimony “a lot quicker, obviously, than having somebody on\nthe witness stand testifying.” However, the court would count deposition testimony against\nthe limit “if it gets to be excessive . . . .” The court had reviewed the parties’ revised\n\n\n\n\n69\n      The court said: “[T]he time allocation refers to witness time and does not include\nopening statements (if any), pretrial and other motions, closing argument, and other\nprocedural matters requiring Court time.”\n                                                    108\n\fwitness lists and exhibit lists, and, in the court’s view, these lists confirmed that “the 30-\n                          70\nhour limit is correct.”\n       On the first day of trial, the court clarified that the time limit applied only to live\ntestimony. The court explained that, based on pretrial litigation, “it [is] obvious to me that\nwithout specific limits for trial presentation this trial could easily divulge [sic] into a morass\nof side issues and side arguments.” The court increased the time limit to 40 hours per side.\nIt then overruled the defense objections to the time limits.\n       After plaintiff’s expert epidemiologist Lanphear testified, SWC’s trial counsel asked\nto submit an offer of proof of what additional questions he would have asked if he had not\nbeen subject to the time limits. The court acceded to his request to “file something” later.\nDuring the defense case, while the defense still had eight hours of time remaining, SWC\nrequested additional time. The court rejected that request. Near the end of the defense case,\nthe defense asked the court to allow it an additional hour to present a witness on abatement.\nThe court agreed to “be flexible about that, within limits.” The court did not interrupt the\nlengthy testimony by the defense abatement expert. After his testimony, the defense rested\nwithout requesting additional time.\n       When plaintiff presented its first rebuttal witness, the defense asked for 15 minutes to\ncross-examine him. The court granted this request. The defense completed its cross\nwithout being interrupted. After plaintiff’s second rebuttal witness testified, the court\noffered the defense the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, but the defense declined.\nThe defense freely cross-examined plaintiff’s third rebuttal witness without interruption.\n       The trial actually consumed 24 court days. After trial, defendants delivered to the\ncourt 47 binders of proposed deposition designations for 46 witnesses to supplement the\ntrial record. The court rejected 25 of the 47 binders, but it permitted 22 of the binders (for\n\n\n70\n      The court also informed the parties that the defense would have 30 minutes for each\ndefendant for opening statement, but plaintiff would be limited to a single 30-minute\nopening statement for all 10 jurisdictions.\n                                               109\n\f21 witnesses) to be admitted into evidence. The court subsequently rejected defendants’\nrequest for reconsideration of this ruling.\n                                          b. Analysis\n       Defendants complain that the trial court prejudicially erred in imposing\n“unreasonable time limits” on their examination of witnesses at trial and rejecting their\nefforts to use deposition designations and offers of proof to present evidence outside of\nthose time limits.\n       Defendants appear to believe that Evidence Code section 351 precluded the trial\ncourt from limiting the amount of time they could use for their evidentiary presentation.\nThis statute provides: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, all relevant evidence is\nadmissible.” The fact that relevant evidence is admissible does not mean that a trial court\nmay not restrict a party from making an unduly time-consuming presentation of its\nevidence.\n       We review the trial court’s imposition of time limits for abuse of discretion.\n(California Crane School, Inc. v. National Com. for Certification of Crane Operators\n(2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 12, 23 (Crane).) In Crane, the Fifth District Court of Appeal\nconsidered the merits of court-imposed time limits for a civil trial. We set forth the Fifth\nDistrict’s analysis at some length because it cogently refutes defendants’ contention that\n                          71\ntime limits are forbidden.\n       “Some litigants are of the mistaken opinion that when they are assigned to a court for\ntrial they have camping rights. This view presumes that the trial judge must defer to the\nlawyers’ time estimates for the conduct of the trial such that, for example, when examining\nwitnesses, unless a valid objection is made by one’s opponent, a party is entitled to take\nwhatever time it believes necessary to question each witness. This view is not only contrary\n\n\n71\n       Defendants do not acknowledge the existence of Crane despite the fact that the\nCrane opinion was published in May 2014, well before any of the briefs were filed in this\ncase (beginning in September 2014), and plaintiff cited Crane in its appellate brief.\n                                              110\n\fto law but undermines a trial judge’s obligation to be protective of the court’s time and\nresources as well as the time and interests of trial witnesses, jurors and other litigants\nwaiting in line to have their cases assigned to a courtroom. [Fn. omitted.] The Evidence\nCode expressly empowers trial judges to limit the presentation of evidence, even evidence\nthat is relevant and probative. Evidence Code section 352 authorizes the court to exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will necessitate undue consumption of time. Evidence Code section 765,\nsubdivision (a) provides that the court shall exercise control over the mode of interrogation\nof witnesses ‘so as to make interrogation as rapid, as distinct, and as effective for the\nascertainment of truth.’ Both statutes describe powers that the court may exercise on its\nown initiative. [¶] It is incumbent upon trial judges to manage trials efficiently. Efficiency\nis not necessarily measured by comparing the actual length of a trial with the parties’\noriginal time estimate because parties often overestimate or underestimate a trial’s length.\nJudges need to be proactive from the start in both assessing what a reasonable trial time\nestimate is and in monitoring the trial’s progress so that the case proceeds smoothly without\ndelay. . . . Trial time management is an ongoing responsibility of the trial judge, regardless\nof the case’s complexity, the number of witnesses called or whether specific time limits\nhave been imposed. [¶] . . . [¶]\n       “For those cases in which the trial judge believes time limits should be set, the court\nshould first elicit estimates from the parties and invite each side to comment on the other’s\nestimate. Once the parties have presented their views, the court should independently\nevaluate the estimates based on the arguments of the parties, the state of the pleadings, the\nlegal and factual issues presented, the number of witnesses likely to testify, the court’s trial\nschedule and hours, and the court’s experience in trying similar cases. [¶] . . . [¶]\n       “There are advantages to specifying time limits in court hours rather than court days.\nAn hour time limit imposed on one side would include all time that party spends in\nexamining its own witnesses (direct and redirect) as well as time spent in examining the\n\n                                               111\n\fadverse party’s witnesses (cross and recross). It would include the time spent in delivering\nan opening statement and final argument. As contrasted with a time limit expressed in court\ndays, an hour limit, as described, is not diminished by matters beyond the party’s control,\nsuch as the amount of time an opponent uses to cross-examine said party’s\nwitnesses. . . . The parties are entitled to be kept advised on a regular basis and upon\nrequest of how much time each side has used and has remaining. [Fn. omitted.]\n       “. . . [A]ny time limit order should be reasonable, mindful that each party is entitled\nto a full and fair opportunity to present its case. Trials are a dynamic process without the\nbenefit of a dress rehearsal, which makes forecasting the length of a trial less than precise.\nBut for those parties and attorneys who are fully prepared for trial and do not waste time\nwith repetitive questioning, cumulative evidence, not having witnesses available, or not\nhaving documentary evidence organized and easily accessible, a trial’s length is not an\nissue. Thus, despite the vagaries of trial, when all parties try a case diligently, there is no\nreason for time limits. In all other cases, time limits will provide incentive to be diligent.\n[¶] Any limits imposed should be subject to revision (upward or downward) for good cause\nshown either on a party’s or the court’s own motion. . . . [¶] Not all cases are suitable for\nthe imposition of time limits. More often it is sufficient if the trial judge manages the trial\nin such a way that the trial proceeds efficiently without delays, repetition or dead time.\nHowever, in those cases in which the trial court imposes time limits, it is also important that\nthose limits be enforced.” (Crane, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at pp. 19-22.)\n       The Fifth District’s opinion in Crane provides an excellent explanation of how and\nwhy a civil trial court may use time limits to ensure an efficient trial. In this case, the trial\ncourt did precisely as the Fifth District later recommended. First, the trial court “elicit[ed]\n[time] estimates from the parties.” Second, it “independently evaluate[d] the estimates\nbased on the arguments of the parties, the state of the pleadings, the legal and factual issues\npresented, the number of witnesses likely to testify, the court’s trial schedule and hours, and\nthe court’s experience in trying [complex] cases.” (Crane, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at p. 20.)\n\n                                               112\n\fThird, the court specified the time limits in court hours, which “provide[d] [the parties]\nincentive to be diligent,” and “kept [the parties] advised on a regular basis . . . of how much\n                                                  72\ntime each side ha[d] used and ha[d] remaining.”        (Crane, at p. 21.) Fourth, the court was\nresponsive to the need to revise its original time limit and to allow additional time at the end\nof the trial when a showing was made that more time was necessary. Indeed, the trial court\nwent to great lengths to ensure that its “reasonable” time limits did not prevent any of the\nparties from having “a full and fair opportunity to present its case.” (Ibid.)\n       Nor was there any abuse of discretion in the court’s ruling on defendants’ “mass of\nbinders” presented at the end of the trial. As the trial court observed, this avalanche of\n“unreasonable and excessive” material was in direct violation of the court’s prior\n“directives,” consisted primarily of “individuals who were not listed on the trial witness\nlists,” and was consistent with defendants’ pattern of attempts “to skirt the time limits\nimposed by the Court.” And even then the court exercised considerable patience with\ndefendants, sorting through this mass of material and admitting about half of these\ndeposition designations into evidence.\n       Under the circumstances, we can find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\nimposition of time limits, enforcement of those time limits, and rejection of defendants’\nattempt to undermine those limits by sneaking in additional evidence in the form of a\nmassive amount of deposition designations and offers of proof.\n                        4. Lead Paint Rather than Lead Pigments\n       Defendants contend that the trial court deprived them of “fair notice” and a “fair\ntrial” and “violated due process by changing the product at issue after trial” from lead\n“pigments” to lead “paint.”\n\n\n\n\n72\n       This is not a case like In re Marriage of Carlsson (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 281, in\nwhich the trial judge abused its discretion by abruptly terminating the trial in the midst of a\nparty’s examination of a witness. (Id. at p. 289.)\n                                              113\n\f       Defendants’ contention is frivolous. Since the outset of this case, it has been\nunmistakably clear that the focus of plaintiff’s public nuisance cause of action was lead\npaint. In Santa Clara I, in 2006, this court expressly identified plaintiff’s allegations as\nasserting that defendants “promot[ed] lead paint for interior use even though defendants had\nknown for nearly a century that such a use of lead paint was hazardous to human beings.”\n(Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 306, italics added.) The California Supreme\nCourt recognized in Santa Clara II in 2010 that this was an action concerning “lead\npaint . . . .” (Santa Clara II, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 43.) Plaintiff’s opening statement at the\n2013 trial of this action again targeted “lead paint.” Even SWC’s fellow defendant NL\nacknowledged in its opening statement that this action was about “Lead-based paint . . . .”\n       Notwithstanding the fact that it was well recognized years before trial that this case\nwas about lead paint, after plaintiff’s case-in-chief, SWC moved for judgment and argued to\nthe trial court that it was entitled to judgment because “this is a pigment case” rather than a\nlead paint case. SWC claimed that this distinction was important because it could not be\nliable for promotion of lead pigments since it made white lead carbonate pigment only for\nuse in its own paints and did not promote lead pigment to other paint manufacturers.\nSWC’s view was that plaintiff had chosen not to base its case on promotion of lead paint to\nconsumers. Plaintiff responded: “To argue that promoting lead pigment on its own can\nform the basis of liability, but that putting that lead pigment in paint and telling consumers\nto use it specifically in a residence somehow insulates you from public nuisance liability is\njust counterintuitive to the legal principles and to the evidence that’s here in this case.” The\ncourt denied SWC’s motion.\n       SWC’s argument below and on appeal has no merit. SWC and its fellow defendants\nhave always known that this case was about lead paint. Neither plaintiff nor the court\n“chang[ed] the product” in this case. This case was always about lead paint.\n\n\n\n\n                                              114\n\f                                  5. RASSCLE Database\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erroneously “denied defendants a reasonable\nopportunity to obtain and analyze the full RA[S]SCLE database before trial.” They claim\nthat, if they had had full access to the “RASSCLE data” further in advance of trial, that data\n“would have refuted plaintiffs’ outdated, inapposite national studies” on the sources of\nelevated BLLs that the trial court relied upon.\n                                       a. Background\n       “RASSCLE is an acronym for Response and Surveillance System for Childhood\nLead Exposure.” The RASSCLE databases were created by the CLPPB. RASSCLE II is “a\nweb-based system that is available in a number of the counties in the state” and contains\ndata from 2006 and thereafter. RASSCLE I was its predecessor. RASSCLE I was closed in\napproximately 2009.\n       The “RASSCLE database . . . is a collection of the laboratory results of blood lead\nlevel testing results from all of the commercial laboratories in California.” It is not random;\nit simply collects all of the data from children who happen to be tested for lead in\nCalifornia. California regulations require that all children receiving government assistance\nbe tested for lead at age one and age two. State regulations also require that children living\nin pre-1978 housing with deteriorated paint or that has been recently renovated be tested for\nlead. These regulations produce about 700,000 tests each year. However, many of the\nhigh-risk children targeted by RASSCLE for testing do not get tested because testing occurs\nonly if a health provider orders a test. Kaiser members are overrepresented in RASSCLE\nbecause Kaiser makes lead screening a priority. Only about 75 percent of the children\nrequired to be tested are actually tested. The RASSCLE databases contain all cases where a\nchild tested at 10 mcg/dL or higher. Only about 30 percent of the children in the 10\njurisdictions are included in the two RASSCLE databases.\n       The defense conceded that RASSCLE I had been produced by all entities except\nMonterey County. Monterey County was unable to access its RASSCLE I database because\n\n                                             115\n\fit did not know the password. When the court set the trial for July 15, 2013, the RASSCLE\nII database was expected to be produced by the state by June 21, 24 days before the\nbeginning of trial. Defendants claimed that they needed the RASSCLE II data in order to\nsupport their argument that the lead problem had been taken care of because BLLs had\nfallen dramatically. They also claimed that the RASSCLE II data would show that the\ncurrent blood levels were due to other sources besides lead paint. Plaintiffs were willing to\nstipulate that there had been a dramatic drop in BLLs.\n        Defendants received the complete RASSCLE II database on June 21, 2013, three\nweeks before trial. They immediately provided it to their experts. Defendants told the trial\ncourt that their experts estimated that they needed “eight to ten weeks to fully analyze” this\ninformation. They sought a continuance of the trial, but the court denied their request. The\ncourt expressed its belief that the data could be analyzed in a few days and queried: “What\nare they using yellow pads and number 2 pencils? Come on. An abacus.”\n        During its opening statement on July 15, 2013, NL’s trial counsel told the court that\nthe defense was due to receive a report from its experts on the RASSCLE II database on\nJuly 22, 2013. Defense witnesses did not begin testifying until August 15, 2013. A defense\nexpert witness testified on August 15 about his review of the RASSCLE data from 2007\nthrough part of 2012. He testified that he had “go[ne] through the RASSCLE data in\ndetail . . . .”\n                                         b. Analysis\n        While defendants are less than clear about the precise nature of their contention, we\nunderstand them to be arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their\nmotion for a continuance of the trial to permit them more time to analyze the RASSCLE II\n                                                           73\ndata that was provided to them three weeks before trial.        “A trial court has great discretion\n\n\n73\n      Our endeavor is made more difficult by defendants’ failure to cite any authority in\nsupport of this contention other an irrelevant passage in the United States Supreme Court’s\nopinion in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) __ U.S. __ [133 S.Ct. 2612] (Shelby). Shelby\n                                              116\n\fin the disposition of an application for a continuance. Absent a clear abuse of discretion,\nthe court’s determination will not be disturbed.” (Estate of Smith (1973) 9 Cal.3d 74, 81.)\nHere, the trial court reasonably concluded that defendants did not need two entire months to\nhave their experts analyze the RASSCLE II data. The trial had not yet begun when the\nexperts received the RASSCLE II data, and the defense claim that analysis of this data\nwould take a minimum of eight weeks was subject to considerable doubt, particularly as the\ndefense had repeatedly sought to delay the trial. In fact, the defense experts were able to\nanalyze the data in less than one month after receiving it, and the defense did not put on any\nwitnesses until nearly two months after its experts received the RASSCLE II data. Under\nthese circumstances, we can find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s denial of\ndefendants’ continuance motion.\n                                 6. Inspection of Properties\n       Defendants contend that the trial court’s “pre-trial rulings prohibiting discovery”\nviolated due process by “prevent[ing] defendants from mounting a defense to the condition\nof the supposed nuisance properties or to their culpability at each.” They assert that the\ncourt “refused to allow defendants to inspect and exonerate themselves at the claimed\nnuisance properties” and “quashed defendants’ attempt to inspect the alleged nuisance\nproperties and to take discovery of property owners and the Jurisdiction’s decisionmakers.”\n\n\n\ndeclared unconstitutional a section of the federal voting rights act that, in the court’s view,\nselected jurisdictions for “preclearance” “based on 40-year-old facts having no logical\nrelation to the present day.” (Shelby, at p. 2629.) The court concluded that “[i]t would have\nbeen irrational for Congress [in 2006] to distinguish between States in such a fundamental\nway based on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an entirely different story.”\n(Shelby, at pp. 2630-2631.) The point that defendants may be trying to make is that the\nRASSCLE data would have updated prior studies. Of course this is not true. Because\nRASSCLE data was not compiled in a random fashion and did not even include all of the\ntargeted population, it was not comparable to the data in the studies relied on by plaintiff.\nIn any case, since defendants actually had full access to all of the RASSCLE data in time\nfor their experts to fully analyze it before testifying at trial, defendants could not have been\nprejudiced by the court’s refusal to further delay the trial.\n                                              117\n\f       Less than a month before trial, defendants filed an ex parte motion seeking “to serve\ninspection notices and notice depositions of landlords using the information disclosed in the\nRASSCLE databases, case files, and other documents recently produced or to be produced\nby plaintiffs and the State.” Defendants claimed that their motion should be granted\n“because inspection of those addresses and depositions of landlords is necessary to gain\nevidence on several important topics including (a) whether a paint containing white lead\npigment is even present, as plaintiffs assume to be the case but will not have proved; (b) the\ncondition of any such paint and the reasons therefor including the landlord’s violation of\nCalifornia Health & Safety Code §§ 17920.10 and 17980 et seq., which require property-\nowners to abate ‘lead hazards;’ (c) the cause of any EBLLs [(elevated BLLs)] including\nalternative sources of lead in or around the residence; and (d) the effect of any remediation\non BLLs and the efficacy of remediation.” “This evidence will support defendants’ position\nthat, if there is any continuing problem at all, it is the result of poor maintenance, not mere\npresence.” “Defendants recognize the practical limitations on the number of residences that\ncan be inspected and landlords who can be deposed, especially with the short time between\nproduction of the case files and RASSCLE databases and the current trial date. Although\nthe precise properties that defendants seek to inspect will depend on completing review of\nthe recently, and to-be, produced documents, defendants have identified residences in San\nMateo with lead hazards that it appears were not remediated despite numerous orders from\nthe CLPPP to do so.” One of defendants’ attorneys declared that he had reviewed “case\nfiles produced by plaintiffs,” some of which “identify residences in which it appears that\nlead hazards were not remediated, despite numerous orders from the CLPPP to do so.” The\ncourt denied this ex parte motion.\n       Defendants claim that the court’s “prohibition on discovery” amounted to a denial of\ndue process, but the sole authority that they cite in support of their contention regarding\ninspection of properties is page 958 of the California Supreme Court’s opinion in\nRutherford v. Owens-Illinois, Inc. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 953. Since defendants submit no\n\n                                              118\n\fargument connecting this citation to their contention, we are given no guidance as to what\n                                                                                   74\nthis page of this case might have to do with defendants’ appellate contention.          Rutherford\nwas a strict products liability action seeking damages for harm caused by asbestos. The\nissue before the California Supreme Court was whether it was prejudicial error for the trial\ncourt to give a causation instruction that shifted the burden on causation to the defendants.\nThe court held that the instruction was erroneous but not prejudicial. The page cited by\ndefendants is a portion of the introduction to the opinion. Our best guess is that defendants\nare contending that they should have been permitted to attempt to disprove causation by\nestablishing that the lead paint at particular properties did not come from their products.\n       Yet their actual contention is that the court erred in denying their ex parte motion to\n                                             75\nserve inspection notices on third parties.        “The standard of review for discovery orders is\nabuse of discretion.” (Avant! Corp. v. Superior Court (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 876, 881.)\nDefendants cite no statutory or other authority for the court to grant an application to serve\ninspection notices on third parties. “[A] party’s right to inspect documents or other physical\nevidence in the possession or custody of the opposing party depends upon compliance with\nthe procedures set out in [Code of Civil Procedure] section 2031. On the other hand, there\nare situations where documents can be obtained without the other party’s cooperation (for\nexample, under the Public Records Act or from a friendly third party or by hiring a trained\ninvestigator or on the internet). . . . [P]roperty open to the public can be examined without\nrecourse to section 2031 . . . provided that the examination can be conducted in a lawful\nfashion.” (Pullin v. Superior Court (2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1161, 1164-1165, italics added.)\nSince defendants have identified no authority upon which the trial court could have based a\n\n\n\n74\n       Like so many of defendants’ appellate contentions, this one is difficult to understand.\nAn appellate court should not be required to decipher the meaning of a contention that is not\nseparately headed in any opening brief and for which no relevant authority is identified.\n75\n       We can find no indication in defendants’ appellate briefing that they are challenging\nthe court’s denial of their request to depose “landlords.”\n                                                   119\n\fdecision to grant their application to serve inspection notices on third parties, the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying the application.\n                                         7. Spoliation\n       Defendants claim that they were denied a fair trial because plaintiff’s “spoliation of\nevidence” deprived them of evidence that was “important” to their defense.\n       Defendants identify in their opening brief only two items of “important” evidence\nthat they claim were destroyed by plaintiff. First, they assert that Monterey County\ndestroyed evidence when it changed a statement that had previously appeared on its Web\nsite acknowledging that most cases of elevated BLLs in that county were attributable not to\nlead paint but to other sources. This statement was not destroyed evidence; evidence of the\nremoved statement came in at trial. Second, they assert that San Francisco destroyed\nevidence because it did not retain lead test reports that did not detect a BLL of 5 mcg/dL or\nhigher. Although the lead test reports themselves were “shredded,” the evidence presented\nat trial reflected that the results in those reports were reported to the state and were\ncontained in the state’s records. Hence, no “important” evidence was destroyed.\n       SWC’s reply brief suggests that two other types of evidence were destroyed.\nMonterey County did not retain any prior e-mails that were not in existence in January\n2009, and it was unable to provide access to its RASSCLE I database because the only\nperson who knew the password had died. The defense did not claim that there had been any\n“intentional destruction . . . .” Monterey County’s failure to retain pre-2009 e-mails, while\nunfortunate, does not suggest that any important evidence was destroyed. While the\nRASSCLE I database was inaccessible, Monterey County provided its case files, and\ndefendants had the more recent RASSCLE II database available to them. We see no\nindication that defendants were deprived of important evidence as the result of any\n“spoliation” and thus no basis for their claim that they were thereby deprived of a fair trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                               120\n\f                                     K. Appointment of Receiver\n       Defendants contend that their due process rights were violated because the trial court\nappointed the CLPPB to serve as the receiver of the abatement funds without holding an\nevidentiary hearing and in the absence of evidence that the CLPPB could qualify to serve as\na receiver.\n       “A receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action or proceeding is\npending, or by a judge thereof, . . . [a]fter judgment, to carry the judgment into effect.”\n(Code Civ. Proc., § 564, subd. (b)(3).) “Code of Civil Procedure section 564, subdivision\n(b)(3), gives trial courts the discretion to appoint receivers to carry judgments in abatement\nproceedings into effect.” (City and County of San Francisco v. Daley (1993) 16\nCal.App.4th 734, 744.) We review a trial court’s order appointing a receiver for abuse of\ndiscretion. (Ibid.)\n       The appointment of a receiver to oversee the disbursement of the abatement funds in\nthis case was necessary. Defendants were required to deposit funds into “a specifically\ndesignated, dedicated, and restricted abatement fund.” The funds in this account would be\n“disbursed” by the receiver only in response to grant applications from the 10\n                 76\njurisdictions.        To perform this function, the trial court ordered that the abatement fund\n                                                                              77\nwould be “administered by” the CLPPB “on behalf of the people . . . .”             While the trial\ncourt’s decision to appoint a receiver in this case was a necessity, not an abuse of discretion,\nwe agree with defendants that the record does not support the court’s selection of the\nCLPPB to serve as the receiver in this case.\n\n\n\n\n76\n       The court provided that the receiver’s costs would be paid out of the abatement fund.\n77\n      The trial court’s order referred to the CLPPB sometimes as the “administrator” of the\nfund and other times as the “receiver” of the fund. Since the parties assume that the CLPPB\nwas appointed to serve as a receiver, we assume the same.\n                                                   121\n\f       Defendants claim that the CLPPB cannot qualify to serve as a receiver because it is a\nnonparty over which the court lacks jurisdiction, has not consented to act as a receiver, and\nis not impartial due to its being a party-affiliated entity.\n       “No party, or attorney of a party, or person interested in an action . . . can be\n                                                                                                78\nappointed receiver therein without the written consent of the parties, filed with the clerk.”\n(Code Civ. Proc., § 566.) “A receiver is an agent and officer of the court, and is under the\ncontrol and supervision of the court. [Citations.] The receiver is also a fiduciary who must\nact for the benefit of all parties interested in the property.” (City of Chula Vista v. Gutierrez\n(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 681, 685.) The receiver must be “neutral.” (Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 3.1179(a).)\n       Since the trial court held no evidentiary hearing regarding the CLPPB’s ability to\nserve as receiver, the record contains no evidence that the CLPPB has consented to serve as\na receiver in this case or that it is sufficiently impartial to be deemed not “interested” in this\naction so that it can serve as a receiver. On remand, we will direct the court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing on the receiver issue.\n\n\n                                       L. SWC’s Cross-Claim\n       SWC maintains that the trial court erred in failing to issue a declaratory judgment in\n                               79\nresponse to its cross-claim.        SWC sought a declaration that “Intact Lead Paint” that is not\na “ ‘lead hazard’ ” under Health and Safety Code sections 17920.10 and 105251 “or in\nviolation of a valid existing ordinance is not a public nuisance.” It also sought a declaration\nthat owners of properties with “lead hazard[s]” are “solely responsible” for the creation and\n\n\n78\n      The court’s abatement order provided that if the CLPPB was “unwilling or unable”\nto administer the fund, the 10 jurisdictions “shall serve in this capacity.” That cannot be.\nThe 10 jurisdictions are not impartial nonparties and therefore cannot serve as receivers.\n(Code of Civ. Proc., § 566.)\n79\n       SWC’s arguments on this issue simply incorporate its other contentions, which we\nhave already rejected.\n                                                  122\n\fmaintenance of “any public nuisance” and the abatement of any “lead hazard.” In sum,\nSWC sought a declaration that intact lead paint could not be declared a public nuisance and\nthat defendants were not responsible for the creation or abatement of lead hazards. The trial\ncourt rejected SWC’s cross-claim.\n       The declaratory judgment that SWC sought was diametrically opposed to the trial\ncourt’s judgment in favor of plaintiff. The trial court’s statement of decision found that\neven intact interior residential lead paint was a public nuisance if it was on friction surfaces.\nThe court also found that defendants were responsible for the creation and abatement of\nlead-paint-based public nuisances in residential housing in the 10 jurisdictions. As we have\nalready determined, these findings are supported by substantial evidence. Because these\nfindings precluded SWC from obtaining its requested declaratory relief, the trial court did\nnot err in rejecting SWC’s cross-claim.\n\n\n                      M. ConAgra’s Liability As Fuller’s Successor\n       ConAgra challenges the trial court’s determination that it was liable as the successor\nto Fuller. It claims that substantial evidence does not support the trial court’s finding.\n       The trial court found that “ConAgra succeeded to Fuller’s liabilities as a result of a\nseries of corporate mergers and/or the express assumption of liabilities.” It ruled that “it is\nfair and appropriate in this case to so hold and necessary to prevent an injustice.”\n       Our substantial evidence standard of review requires us to uphold the trial court’s\nfinding if “ ‘there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will\nsupport the finding of fact.’ ” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 881.)\n       The ordinary rule for determining “whether a corporation purchasing the principal\nassets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities” is “that the purchaser does not\nassume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) there is an express or implied agreement of\nassumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two\ncorporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) the\n\n                                              123\n\ftransfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the\nseller’s debts.” (Ray v. Alad Corp. (1977) 19 Cal.3d 22, 28, italics added (Ray).)\n        Plaintiff produced evidence at trial that ConAgra had succeeded to Fuller’s liabilities\nas a result of a series of mergers and consolidations. This evidence showed that W.P. Fuller\n& Co. (Fuller), a California corporation, merged into Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc.\n(Hunt), a Delaware corporation, in 1962. After Fuller merged into Hunt, “it [(Fuller)] was\nstill the . . . [¶] . . . same operation.” In 1968, three Delaware corporations, including Hunt,\nconsolidated to become Norton Simon, Inc. (Norton Simon). In 1993, Norton Simon\nmerged with another company to become Beatrice Company, which then merged with and\ninto Hunt-Wesson, Inc. (Hunt-Wesson). In 1999, Hunt-Wesson changed its name to\nConAgra. Since all of these transactions were mergers or consolidations, plaintiff’s\nevidence was sufficient to support the court’s finding that ConAgra succeeded to Fuller’s\nliabilities.\n        ConAgra, relying on evidence it presented at trial, claims that the trial court could not\nhave credited plaintiff’s evidence that it succeeded to Fuller’s liabilities. ConAgra’s\nargument disregards the fundamental rule that a trial court may reject even uncontradicted\nevidence so long as it does not do so arbitrarily. (Hicks v. Reis (1943) 21 Cal.2d 654, 659.)\nThe trial court could have reasonably concluded that the evidence upon which ConAgra\nrelies was not credible.\n        ConAgra relies on evidence it produced that, in 1964, a corporation called “W.P.\nFuller Paint Company” was incorporated. ConAgra asserts in its opening brief that “Hunt\nestablished WPFPC as a wholly-owned subsidiary” and cites nine pages of the appendix.\nThose nine pages consist of a “Certificate of Incorporation” for “W.P. Fuller Paint\nCompany.” The certificate contains no apparent reference to Hunt or to “W.P. Fuller Paint\n\n\n\n\n                                              124\n\fCompany” being a subsidiary of Hunt. Hence, this evidence did not establish that “W.P.\n                                                                      80\nFuller Paint Company” was a “wholly-owned subsidiary” of Hunt.\n       ConAgra claims that “undisputed evidence” establishes that all of Fuller’s liabilities\nwere transferred to “W.P. Fuller Paint Company” in 1967. It relies on a document that\npurports to be minutes of a December 1964 “first meeting” of the board of directors of\n“W.P. Fuller Paint Company.” ConAgra asserts in its opening brief that these minutes\n“state WPFPC accepted Fuller’s paint business, including its liabilities.” These purported\nminutes, which were of uncertain origin, state that, at this meeting, the chairman of the\nboard “stated Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc. had offered to transfer certain assets of W. P.\nFuller & Co., a Division of Hunt, subject to certain liabilities, to this Corporation in\nexchange for Four Hundred Thousand (400,000) shares of common stock having a par value\nof $5 each plus certain long and short-term notes.” The purported minutes also state that the\nboard passed a resolution “that this Corporation accept the proposal that Hunt Foods and\nIndustries, Inc., (‘Hunt’) transfer to this Corporation the inventories, rights, credits, good\nwill and other assets, other than certain fixed assets, consisting principally of certain lands,\nbuildings, machinery and equipment which have been mutually agreed upon, of the business\ncarried on by W. P. Fuller & Co., a Division of Hunt, subject to all of its liabilities.”\n                                                                             81\n       ConAgra’s reliance on these purported 1964 minutes is misplaced.           The purported\nminutes, even if credited, would not establish that Hunt transferred “all of” Fuller’s\nliabilities to “W.P. Fuller Paint Company.” At most, these purported minutes might\n\n\n80\n     We note however that plaintiff does not dispute that Hunt created “W.P. Fuller Paint\nCompany.”\n81\n       ConAgra also quotes extensively from an unpublished Delaware trial court opinion,\nThe O’Brien Corp. v. Hunt-Wesson, Inc. (Del. Ch., Feb. 25, 1999, No. CIV. A. 16562) 1999\nWL 126996, which dismissed on ripeness grounds a complaint for declaratory relief that\nhad been filed by O’Brien against ConAgra’s predecessor. That action sought a declaration\nthat ConAgra’s predecessor, not O’Brien, was Fuller’s successor. O’Brien’s allegations in\nits complaint in that action relied on the purported 1964 minutes. The Delaware trial court’s\ndismissal of that action, which resolved no factual issues, is of no relevance here.\n                                               125\n\fdemonstrate that Hunt had “offered to transfer certain assets” of Fuller “subject to certain\nliabilities.” The nature of the “certain liabilities” that were purportedly part of Hunt’s offer\nwas not specified. While the purported minutes might show that “W.P. Fuller Paint\nCompany” resolved to accept this offer, the purported minutes do not enumerate all of the\nterms of the Hunt offer, do not demonstrate that any acceptance was communicated to Hunt,\nand do not establish that the two corporations ever actually consummated any contemplated\n                                                                  82\ntransfer of any of Fuller’s assets or liabilities on any terms.        The trial court could have\nreasonably rejected the inferences that ConAgra attempts to draw from the purported\nminutes.\n       ConAgra also claims in its appellate brief that, “[i]n 1967, Hunt sold Fuller’s paint\nbusiness to O’Brien.” ConAgra cites two pages from the appendix. One page is an excerpt\nfrom deposition testimony of a former Fuller employee to the effect that he left Fuller in\n1967 after “Norton Simon announced that he was putting the company up for sale.” Since\nNorton-Simon was not created until 1968, the trial court could have reasonably rejected this\ntestimony. The other page is a 1967 newspaper article reporting that Hunt had announced\nthat it had sold “the business and assets” of “Fuller, a wholly owned subsidiary” to O’Brien.\nThe article states: “Specific details of the transaction weren’t disclosed.” Even if the article\nwere to be deemed credible, it would not establish that Hunt’s purported transaction with\nO’Brien transferred Fuller’s liabilities to O’Brien.\n       Under Ray, the purchaser, here O’Brien, did not assume Fuller’s liabilities “unless\n(1) there is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a\nconsolidation or merger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere\ncontinuation of the seller, or (4) the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent\n\n\n\n82\n        ConAgra also produced evidence that, in 1967, “W.P. Fuller Paint Company”\nchanged its name to “WPF, Inc.,” and in 1968, “WPF, Inc.” dissolved. We need not address\nthis evidence, as its relevance depends on the validity of the propositions that ConAgra\nstates in its brief but the trial court rejected.\n                                               126\n\fpurpose of escaping liability for the seller’s debts.” (Ray, supra, 19 Cal.3d at p. 28.)\nConAgra produced no evidence of any of the four predicates that could have shown that\nHunt transferred Fuller’s liabilities to O’Brien. ConAgra suggests that the “product line\nexception” to the Ray test applied, but it also failed to provide any evidentiary support for\nthe application of that exception, even if it were the case that this exception could be applied\n                                                                                          83\noutside the strict products liability context in this public nuisance abatement action.        (See\nFranklin v. USX Corp. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 615, 628 [describing the requirements for\nproduct line exception and refusing to extend it beyond the strict liability context]; Monarch\nBay II v. Professional Service Industries, Inc. (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1217 [limiting\nproduct line exception to strict liability actions].)\n       The trial court was not obligated to credit the truth of the assertions in the purported\n1964 minutes or in the 1967 newspaper article. Since plaintiff’s evidence supports the\ncourt’s finding that Fuller’s liabilities flowed from Hunt to Norton-Simon and through it to\nConAgra, we must uphold the court’s finding that ConAgra was Fuller’s successor.\n\n\n                      V. Lead Paint Cases From Other Jurisdictions\n       Defendants repeatedly cite four cases from other jurisdictions in which courts\nrejected public nuisance actions against lead paint and lead pigment manufacturers.\n       City of Chicago v. American Cyanamid Co., supra, 355 Ill.App.3d 209 (Chicago)\n                                                   84\nwas a public nuisance action seeking abatement by Chicago against the manufacturers and\ndistributors of lead pigments and lead paint. (Id. at pp. 210-211.) Chicago appealed after\nthe action was dismissed for failing to state a claim. (Id. at pp. 211-212.) The Appellate\n\n\n83\n        ConAgra’s reliance on SCM Corp. v. Berkel, Inc. (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 49 is\nmisplaced. That declaratory relief action was tried on stipulated facts and joint exhibits.\n(Id. at p. 52.)\n84\n         Chicago’s action originally sought damages, but on appeal Chicago contended only\nthat it should have been able to seek abatement and punitive damages. (Chicago, supra,\n355 Ill.App.3d at pp. 211-212.)\n                                                127\n\fCourt of Illinois upheld the dismissal on the ground that Chicago had failed to adequately\nallege “proximate cause” because Chicago could not identify any specific defendant as the\nsource of the lead pigment or lead paint at any particular location. (Id. at p. 216.) The court\nrejected Chicago’s contention that the defendants were liable under a “market share” or\n“collective liability” theory. It held that Illinois did not recognize either theory. (Id. at\npp. 217-218.) In addition, the court held that Chicago could not succeed because it had\nfailed to allege that the defendants controlled the property where the alleged nuisance was\nlocated. (Id. at p. 221.)\n       City of St. Louis v. Benjamin Moore & Co. (Mo. 2007) 226 S.W.3d 110 (St. Louis)\nwas a public nuisance action brought by a city against lead paint distributors seeking to\nrecover “damages for assessing, abating, and remediating the nuisance.” (Id. at pp. 113,\n116 [“private tort action” seeking “damages”].) The trial court granted summary judgment\nto the defendants on the ground that the city could not prove causation without\nidentification of the lead manufacturer whose paint had been remediated. (Id. at p. 113.)\nThe Supreme Court of Missouri, relying on a case in which it had held that “market-share\nliability” was contrary to Missouri law, held that “actual causation can be established only\nby identifying the defendant who made or sold that product.” (Id. at p. 115.)\n       In re Lead Paint Litigation, supra, 191 N.J. 405 [924 A.2d 484] (New Jersey) was a\nSupreme Court of New Jersey decision in a case where the trial court had dismissed for\nfailure to state a cause of action a “common law” public nuisance action brought by\nmunicipalities against lead paint manufacturers. (Id. at p. 409.) The Supreme Court of New\nJersey noted that the New Jersey Legislature had declared interior residential lead paint to\nbe a public nuisance and assigned responsibility for it to the owners of the residences, not\npaint manufacturers. (Id. at pp. 429, 432-433.) Relying on the Restatement, the court found\nthat only a tortfeasor “in control of the nuisance” could be held liable for public nuisance,\nand the paint manufacturers lacked such control. (New Jersey, at pp. 425, 429, 433.) The\ncourt also held that the action was barred because the municipalities sought damages, rather\n\n                                               128\n\fthan abatement, and damages were not available in a public nuisance action to a public\nentity plaintiff that had suffered no special injury. (Id. at pp. 435-436.) Finally, the court\nheld that, because the complaint sought to premise liability on a failure to warn, it\n“sound[ed] in products liability” and could not be the basis for a public nuisance action.\n(Id. at pp. 437-439.)\n       State v. Lead Industries Ass’n, Inc., supra, 951 A.2d 428 (Rhode Island) was a\nSupreme Court of Rhode Island decision in a public nuisance action brought by the state in\nwhich a trial court had ordered three former lead pigment manufacturers to abate lead paint.\nThe court held that the trial court should have dismissed the action for failing to state a\ncause of action. (Id. at p. 452.) It found lacking any allegation that the defendants had\ninterfered with a public right and any allegation that the defendants controlled the lead\npigment. (Id. at p. 453.) “The interference must deprive all members of the community of a\nright to some resource to which they otherwise are entitled. [Citation] The Restatement\n(Second) provides much guidance in ascertaining the fine distinction between a public right\nand an aggregation of private rights. ‘Conduct does not become a public nuisance merely\nbecause it interferes with the use and enjoyment of land by a large number of persons.’ ”\n(Id. at p. 453.) “[A] public right is a right of the public to shared resources such as air,\nwater, or public rights of way.” (Id. at p. 455.) The court also held, in reliance on New\nJersey, that the complaint was inadequate because it had failed to “allege any facts that\nwould support a conclusion that defendants were in control of the lead pigment at the time it\nharmed Rhode Island’s children.” (Rhode Island, at p. 455.)\n       These cases are readily distinguishable from the case before us. None of the courts\nin these other jurisdictions assessed the merits of a public nuisance action in light of the\nvoluminous evidence that was presented at the trial in this case. Only the Rhode Island case\nhad been tried, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island considered only the pleadings. The\nChicago and New Jersey cases were dismissed at the pleading stage, and the St. Louis case\nwas dismissed on summary judgment. The evidence presented at the trial in this case\n\n                                               129\n\fproved the elements of a representative public nuisance action, which might not have been\napparent from the pleadings in the actions in these other jurisdictions. Only the Rhode\nIsland and Chicago cases were actions for abatement rather than damages. As we have\npointed out repeatedly, a representative public nuisance action seeking only remedial\nabatement is legally distinct from an action for damages.\n        None of the reasons that the courts in these other jurisdictions provided for their\nrejection of public nuisance liability applies to the case before us. The Chicago court relied\non “lack of control” and a restrictive Illinois causation definition. As this court pointed out\nin Santa Clara I, a defendant’s control of the nuisance is not necessary to establish liability\nin a representative public nuisance action in California. (Santa Clara I, supra, 137\nCal.App.4th at p. 306.) The Illinois causation test is not analogous to California’s\nsubstantial factor test. St. Louis is similarly distinguishable because the court based its\nanalysis on a Missouri causation test that is not analogous to California’s substantial factor\ntest.\n        The New Jersey court’s analysis was based on lack of control, specific New Jersey\nlaws assigning responsibility solely to property owners, and its conclusion that the action,\nwhich was for damages, “sound[ed]” in products liability rather than nuisance. Control is\nnot required in California for a public nuisance action (Santa Clara I, supra, 137\nCal.App.4th at p. 306), and California’s laws do not assign exclusive responsibility for lead\npaint remediation to property owners. This court held in Santa Clara I that a representative\npublic nuisance action is not a disguised products liability action. “A public nuisance cause\nof action is not premised on a defect in a product or a failure to warn but on affirmative\nconduct that assisted in the creation of a hazardous condition. Here, the alleged basis for\ndefendants’ liability for the public nuisance created by lead paint is their affirmative\npromotion of lead paint for interior use, not their mere manufacture and distribution of lead\npaint or their failure to warn of its hazards. [¶] In contrast, a products liability action may\nbe brought only by one who has already suffered a physical injury to his or her person or\n\n                                              130\n\fproperty, and the plaintiff in a products liability action is limited to recovering damages for\nsuch physical injuries.” (Santa Clara I, at pp. 309-310.)\n       The Rhode Island court’s decision was based on lack of control (which does not\napply in California) and lack of interference with a public right. We disagree with the\nRhode Island court’s conclusion that lead paint does not interfere with “shared resources”\n(see section IV(B) of this opinion), and the Rhode Island court’s Restatement-based analysis\nof the “public right” is not consistent with California’s broader statutory definition of a\npublic nuisance. (Rhode Island, supra, 951 A.2d at pp. 453, 455.)\n       We therefore reject defendants’ reliance on these cases from other jurisdictions.\n\n\n                                    VI. Amici Arguments\n       Seven amicus briefs have been filed in this case. Amici Civil Justice Association\n(CJA), Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), and NFIB Small Business Center et al. (NFIB) have\nfiled amicus briefs in support of defendants. Amici American Academy of Pediatrics,\nCalifornia (AAPCA), the Environmental Health Coalition and the Healthy Homes\nCollaborative (EHC), California Conference of Local Health Officers (CCLHO), and a\n                                                                                              85\ngroup of organizations including Changelab, Consumer Attorneys of California and others\n(Changelab) have filed amicus briefs in support of plaintiff.\n\n\n                                           A. CJA\n       CJA contends that we should reject the trial court’s judgment holding lead paint\nmanufacturers liable for creating a public nuisance because courts in other states have\nrejected such actions and certain journal articles have criticized the extension of public\nnuisance liability to such cases. California law is not based on the rulings of courts in other\n\n\n\n85\n      The others are Equal Justice Society, National Center for Healthy Housing,\nPrevention Institute, and Public Health Institute.\n                                              131\n\fstates, which are based on their laws and the facts of their cases, nor would be it appropriate\nfor us to reverse a judgment based on opinions expressed in journal articles. The trial court\nproperly applied California law, and, with one exception, substantial evidence supports its\nabatement order.\n       CJA contends that this case should have been dismissed because it sought resolution\nof a “non-justiciable political question,” but none of the cases it cites is remotely similar to\nthe one before us. CJA’s argument largely repeats the separation of powers arguments\nmade by defendants, which we have already rejected in section IV(C) of this opinion.\n       CJA challenges the trial court’s conclusion that a “public right” was at issue here.\nWe have already addressed that issue in section IV(B) of this opinion. CJA also challenges\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s causation finding and claims that\nthe substantial factor test for causation does not properly encompass the cause-in-fact\nrequirement. The substantial factor test is the law in California. We have already fully\naddressed the causation issue in section IV(A)(4) of this opinion.\n\n\n                                            B. PLF\n       PLF’s brief argues that application of public nuisance law in this case violates due\nprocess and is against public policy. The premise for PLF’s due process contention is its\nclaim that defendants’ conduct “was lawful and non-tortious at the time the Defendants\nengaged in it . . . .” This misunderstanding of the basis for the trial court’s judgment\npermeates PLF’s brief, which makes a frontal assault on the constitutionality of California’s\npublic nuisance law. We reject PLF’s unfounded assertions. Defendants were found liable\nbecause they promoted lead paint for interior residential use knowing that such use would\npose a serious risk of harm to children. This conduct was just as unlawful and tortious\nwhen they engaged in it as it is now because the creation of a public nuisance has been\n\n\n\n\n                                              132\n\funlawful in California since the 1800s. Consequently, the due process problem that PLF\n                                         86\nperceives does not exist in this case.\n       PLF fails to support its claim that the federal constitutional prohibition against\nvagueness in criminal statutes applies to civil liability for creating a public nuisance. PLF\nasserts: “Although most cases involving the ‘constitutional requirement of definiteness,’\n[citation to criminal case], have dealt with criminal statutes, the requirement also applies to\nnuisance law.” PLF goes on to cite as an “example” a criminal case in which a protester\nwas convicted of violating a noise ordinance. PLF then states that “[t]hese principles also\napply to civil laws.” It proceeds to cite cases involving challenges to statutes that prohibited\nspeech. PLF identifies no civil case not involving the suppression of speech in which a\ncourt found that a public nuisance abatement action could not be brought because the statute\nbarring public nuisances was unconstitutionally vague. We reject PLF’s due process\nargument as unfounded.\n       PLF claims that the trial court could not have found “unreasonableness” because it\n“declar[ed] a lawfully sold product to be a public nuisance.” PLF continues to misconstrue\nthe basis for the trial court’s decision. The trial court found that defendants were liable for\ncreating a public nuisance as a result of their conduct in promoting lead paint for interior\nresidential use while knowing of the hazard that such use would create. The court did not\nfind that lead paint itself was a public nuisance. As this court ruled in Santa Clara I, such\nconduct is unreasonable under the statutory definition of a public nuisance.\n       PLF argues that the trial court’s judgment “impermissibly broadens the definition of\n‘public right’ ” by applying it to injuries caused by “products . . . bought and used by\nindividuals . . . .” Once again, PLF misconstrues the trial court’s judgment. No individual\ninjuries are being redressed. The trial court’s judgment requires only that defendants\n\n\n\n86\n      PLF also contends that the trial court’s judgment violates separation of powers, a\ncontention that we have already analyzed in section IV(C) of this opinion.\n                                              133\n\fremediate the dangerous conditions they created in the housing stock in these 10\njurisdictions. PLF also attacks the trial court’s finding of causation, but its argument\nignores the evidence that we have already concluded, with one exception, supports the trial\ncourt’s causation finding.\n       PLF contends that the judgment improperly affects the rights of individual property\nowners without notice. It does not. The abatement plan ordered by the trial court is\npremised on voluntary participation by property owners. No property owners will be forced\nto participate, and therefore their rights will not be involuntarily impacted. While it is true\nthat the abatement plan contemplates that the 10 jurisdictions will make publicly available a\nlist of properties that have not been enrolled in the abatement plan, this provision alone does\nnot substantially impact the rights of individual property owners. Already, any property\nbuilt before 1978 is presumed to contain lead paint. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35043.)\nThat presumption eliminates any impact on a property owner from a publicly available list\nof only those presumptively lead-paint-containing properties that have not been enrolled in\nthe abatement plan. Property owners can only gain from enrollment in the plan; they have\nnothing to lose. PLF insists that the court’s abatement order has “declared a nuisance” on\nindividual properties without notice to the property owners. Not so. The trial court ordered\ndefendants to abate the public nuisance they had created, but it did not identify any specific\nproperties. The abatement plan itself is designed to identify and remediate the individual\nproperties upon which defendants’ public nuisance exists.\n       PLF maintains that public policy and a “national trend” favor rejection of the\napplication of public nuisance in this case. It relies in part on out-of-state cases that have\nrejected public nuisance liability in lead paint cases. Those cases did not apply California\npublic nuisance law, so they are inapposite. PLF’s reliance on Firearm Cases is no more\nhelpful to its cause. In that case, the First District Court of Appeal found causation\n\n\n\n\n                                              134\n\f           87\nlacking.        “Merely engaging in what plaintiffs deem to be a risky practice, without a\nconnecting causative link to a threatened harm, is not a public nuisance.” (Firearm Cases,\nsupra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 988.) “In this case, there is no causal connection between any\nconduct of the defendants and any incident of illegal acquisition of firearms or criminal acts\nor accidental injury by a firearm.” (Id. at p. 989.) Here, unlike in the First District’s case,\ndefendants did not merely sell a product that posed a risk of harm. Defendants promoted\nlead paint for interior residential use knowing that such use would create a serious risk of\nharm to children. As we have already determined, substantial evidence supports the trial\ncourt’s decision that, with one exception, plaintiff established causation.\n       PLF argues that public policy weighs against recognizing a public nuisance cause of\naction in this case. “[I]f the lawful sale of a legal product can later serve as the basis of\npublic nuisance liability of unlimited severity, businesses will be less willing to participate\nin the California market, or to provide citizens with products that might later prove\nhazardous or simply unpopular.” This argument is divorced from the facts of this case.\nWhen a manufacturer promotes a product for a specific use that it knows will create a\nhazardous condition, public policy supports the use of California public nuisance law to\nrequire the manufacturer to remediate the hazards created by its conduct.\n\n\n                                              C. NFIB\n       NFIB argues that the trial court failed to require plaintiff to establish that defendants\nacted with the requisite knowledge and that defendants’ conduct caused the public nuisance.\nWe have already addressed these issues in response to defendants’ contentions. NFIB also\nrepeats some of the same arguments that PLF makes, which we have already rejected.\nNFIB argues that courts have previously rejected large-scale public nuisance actions, but it\n\n\n\n87\n       PLF repeatedly identifies that case as being from “this Court.” It is not from this\ncourt, but from the First District.\n                                                 135\n\foffers no detailed analysis of the reasons why those cases failed. It also notes that prior\npublic nuisance actions in other states against lead paint manufacturers have failed. NFIB’s\nmain argument seems to be that courts should not allow public nuisance causes of action to\nbe based on products, and it explicitly urges this court to “reconsider” Santa Clara I. We\ndecline to do so for the reasons expressed in Santa Clara I.\n\n\n                               D. Amici Supporting Plaintiff\n       Changelab argues that public nuisance abatement orders like the trial court’s decision\nare urgently needed due to the lack of resources to combat the “epidemic” of lead poisoning\narising from lead paint in residential housing. AAPCA emphasizes the need for “primary\nprevention” to ensure safe housing for children to avoid the “potentially devastating effects”\nof childhood lead poisoning, including irreversible cognitive impairment and developmental\nproblems. It notes that remediation of housing containing lead paint is “the most critical\nstep” in primary prevention. CCLHO echoes these concerns and points out the burden on\ngovernmental resources created by childhood lead poisoning, which disproportionately\nimpacts economically disadvantaged children. EHC observes that a large portion of the\nhousing stock continues to contain deteriorating lead paint that poses a serious health risk to\nchildren. EHC expresses substantial concern about the fact that the children most at risk,\nthe poor, who live in the oldest, most deteriorated housing, are those with the least access to\nhealthcare and are therefore those who are the least likely to be tested for lead and treated\nfor lead poisoning.\n       All of the concerns expressed by the amici in support of plaintiff support the trial\ncourt’s decision to order remedial abatement as an equitable remedy for defendants’\nknowing creation of a public nuisance.\n\n\n\n\n                                              136\n\f                                      VII. Disposition\n       The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court with\ndirections to (1) recalculate the amount of the abatement fund to limit it to the amount\nnecessary to cover the cost of remediating pre-1951 homes, and (2) hold an evidentiary\nhearing regarding the appointment of a suitable receiver. Plaintiff shall recover its costs on\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             137\n\f                                _______________________________\n                                Mihara, J.\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________\nPremo, Acting P.

(NL), and the Sherwin-Williams Company\n         1\n(SWC). The trial court ordered ConAgra, NL, and SWC to pay $1.15 billion into a fund to\nbe used to abate the public nuisance created by interior residential lead paint in the 10\n\n\n\n1\n       Plaintiff’s action was brought on behalf of the residents of Santa Clara County, San\nFrancisco City and County, Alameda County, Los Angeles County, Monterey County, City\nof Oakland, City of San Diego, San Mateo County, Solano County, and Ventura County. In\nthis opinion, we will refer to these two cities, seven counties, and one city and county as the\n10 jurisdictions.\n\fCalifornia jurisdictions represented by plaintiff. ConAgra, NL, and SWC (collectively\ndefendants) challenge the court’s judgment on many grounds. They contend, among other\nthings, that the court’s judgment is not supported by substantial evidence of knowledge,\npromotion, causation, or abatability. Defendants also challenge the judgment on separation\nof powers and due process grounds, claim that they were erroneously denied a jury trial, and\n                                                                                     2\nassert that the trial court made other prejudicial procedural and evidentiary errors. We\nconclude that the trial court’s judgment must be reversed because substantial evidence does\nnot support causation as to residences built after 1950. We also direct the trial court to hold\nfurther proceedings on remand regarding the appointment of a suitable receiver. We reject\nthe remainder of defendants’ contentions.\n\n\n                               I. Plaintiff’s Evidence at Trial\n       “[L]ead is a toxin and causes irreversible brain damage.” Childhood lead poisoning\nis “the number one environmental health problem for children” in California. “Childhood\nlead poisoning at the level at which it is occurring is definitely an epidemic in California.”\n“The most common source of lead exposure to children in California is lead-based paint and\n                                                                            3\nhow it contributes to soil and dust contamination in and around housing.” Experts have\nreached a consensus “that lead-based paint is a predominant source of childhood lead\n                                  4\nexposure [in] pre-1978 housing.” Children in pre-1946 housing are subject to “three times\n\n\n\n\n2\n       This is but a partial list of their contentions. SWC and ConAgra also each assert an\nindividual contention.\n3\n       “Lead-based paint” is not the only source of childhood lead exposure. Children in\nthe 10 jurisdictions have also been exposed to lead from occupational sources (such as lead\ndust brought home by construction workers), leaded gasoline, imported goods (such as\npottery, Mexican candy, and toys), home remedies (such as “Greta” and “Azarcon”),\ncosmetics, jewelry, spices, and chapulines (grasshoppers).\n4\n       “ ‘Lead-based paint’ means paint or other surface coatings that contain an amount of\nlead equal to, or in excess of: [¶] (a) one milligram per square centimeter (1.0 mg/cm2); or\n                                               2\n\fthe percentage of elevations in blood lead level” as those in post-1978 housing. Lead in\nhomes accounts for at least 70 percent of all childhood lead poisonings. Lead paint is a\nmajor contributor to blood lead levels because the lead content of paint is high, while most\nother lead sources have only trace amounts. And the most common type of lead paint\ncontains white lead carbonate, which is highly absorbable. Between 1929 and 1974, more\nthan 75 percent of the white lead carbonate produced in this country was used in lead paint.\nThrough the 1940s, lead paint contained as much as 50 percent lead.\n       “Children are exceptionally vulnerable” to lead because “they explore their\nenvironment with typical hand-to-mouth contact behavior.” Lead paint chips “taste sweet,”\nwhich may explain why children ingest them. Young children are at especially high risk\nfrom residential lead paint because they spend the vast majority of their time in their homes.\nInfants and young children also absorb much more lead than older children and adults.\nBecause children are smaller, lead intake has a proportionally larger impact on their bodies,\nand children absorb lead more easily. Children are also more vulnerable to the toxic effects\nof lead because their biological systems are still developing.\n       The “brain effects [of lead exposure] in children are irreversible,” so the “only option\nis to prevent the exposure in the first place.” There is “no safe exposure level” for lead\n“[b]ecause no measurable level of lead in blood is known to be without deleterious effects,\nand because once engendered the effects appear to be irreversible.” Blood lead levels less\n                                          5\nthan 5 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) can cause children to suffer impaired intellect\n                          6\nand behavioral problems. “[E]ven among children with the lowest levels of lead\nexposure,” studies suggest that “there is ongoing harm down to the lowest measurable\n\n\n\n[¶] (b) half of one percent (0.5%) by weight.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35033.) This is\nwhat we mean when we use “lead paint” in this opinion.\n5\n       A microgram (mcg) is a millionth of a gram. A deciliter (dL) is a tenth of a liter.\n6\n        Bone lead levels are a better indicator than blood lead levels of the impact of lead on\nintellectual abilities. Blood lead levels may underestimate the impact of lead exposure.\n                                               3\n\flevels.” “[B]lood lead levels below 5 micrograms per deciliter are associated with\ndecreased academic achievement, diminished IQ scores, or intellectual abilities, cognitive\nabilities, attention-related behavior problems and antisocial behaviors . . . .” Lead exposure\nas a child continues to impact the body when the child becomes an adult. It “has\nreproductive effects, it has impacts on things like birth weight, and even fertility, delays\nfertility,” and it can be associated with cardiovascular disease.\n       Even intact lead paint poses a potential risk of future lead poisoning to children\nbecause lead paint surfaces will inevitably deteriorate. “[A]ll paint eventually deteriorates.\nOn certain surfaces it deteriorates more rapidly than others[;] mainly those surfaces are\nhigh-use surfaces, such as windows and doors.” Paint deteriorates when it is exposed to\nultraviolet light, water, fungus (such as mildew), friction, or abrasion. More than one-third\n                                                                       7\nof pre-1978 homes nationwide with intact lead paint have lead dust. In contrast, only 6\npercent of homes without lead paint have lead dust. Lead in soil adjacent to homes\ngenerally comes from lead paint, not leaded gas emissions, because post-1978 housing has\n                8\nno soil lead.\n       Most of the housing in the 10 jurisdictions was built before 1980, with the\n                                                                                               9\npercentages ranging from 51 to 83 percent and is therefore presumed to contain lead paint.\n\n\n\n7\n       “ ‘Lead-contaminated dust’ means dust that contains an amount of lead equal to, or in\nexcess of: [¶] (a) forty micrograms per square foot (40mg/ft2) for interior floor surfaces; or\n[¶] (b) two hundred and fifty micrograms per square foot (250mg/ft2) for interior horizontal\nsurfaces; or [¶] (c) four hundred micrograms per square foot (400mg/ft2) for exterior floor\nand exterior horizontal surfaces.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35035.)\n8\n       “ ‘Lead-contaminated soil’ means bare soil that contains an amount of lead equal to,\nor in excess of, four hundred parts per million (400 ppm) in children’s play areas and one\nthousand parts per million (1000 ppm) in all other areas.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17,\n§ 35036.)\n9\n       “ ‘Presumed lead-based paint’ means paint or surface coating affixed to a component\nin or on a structure constructed prior to January 1, 1978.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17,\n§ 35043.)\n                                               4\n\f                                                                               10\nPre-1940 homes are three times as likely to have lead-based paint hazards, with 86 percent\nhaving lead-based paint hazards and 67 percent having “significant” lead-based paint\n                                                   11\nhazards such as“deteriorated lead-based paint.”         “[H]omes with lead-based paint are 10\ntimes more likely than homes without lead-based paint to have dust lead levels on floors and\non window sills above the federal limits.” And “homes with lead-based paint are more\nlikely to have soil lead levels on the exterior of the home above the EPA [(federal\nEnvironmental Protection Agency)] criteria limits.” Even when lead paint is “intact,” soil\nlevels can exceed EPA limits. Lead paint creates soil lead “by the friction and impact\nsurfaces, opening and closing windows and doors on a home with lead-based paint,” from\nthe deterioration of exterior lead paint, and from “sanding and scraping” when repainting.\nWhen there is lead in the soil, it is often tracked into the home, creating household lead\ndust.\n        Since the 19th century, the medical profession has recognized that lead paint is toxic\nand a poison. An 1878 article by an English doctor recognized that the use of lead paint on\nthe interiors of homes could have poisonous effects on the people who lived in the home.\nAn 1895 article by a San Francisco doctor recounted how a child had been poisoned by lead\npaint that she had scratched off her crib. A 1904 article by a doctor in Queensland,\nAustralia described multiple cases of children being poisoned by lead dust from lead paint\non walls and railings of a house. He believed that the lead dust had been ingested by the\nchildren after it got on their fingers and thereby into their mouths. His investigation found\n\n\n\n\n10\n       “ ‘Lead hazard’ means deteriorated lead-based paint, lead contaminated dust, lead\ncontaminated soil, disturbing lead-based paint or presumed lead-based paint without\ncontainment, or any other nuisance which may result in persistent and quantifiable lead\nexposure.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35037.)\n11\n       “ ‘Deteriorated lead-based paint’ means lead-based paint or presumed lead-based\npaint that is cracking, chalking, flaking, chipping, peeling, non-intact, failed, or otherwise\nseparating from a component.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35022.)\n                                               5\n\f                                                                             12\nlead dust on interior walls where the paint was still in “good condition.”        An authoritative\n1907 textbook edited by a noted American doctor, which was widely used in medical\neducation, discussed the 1904 article and observed that children had been poisoned by lead\n                                                                                                 13\npaint on woodwork in their homes that had produced lead dust and gotten onto their hands.\nThese articles “recognized the dust pathway from paint on a wall, to dust on the floor, to the\nhands of children, into their mouth[s], as a way of ingestion.”\n       Many medical articles by doctors in the early 20th century described lead poisoning\nof children from lead paint. A 1917 article by an American doctor discussed the 1904\nAustralian article and also described the cases of multiple children who had gnawed lead\npaint off furniture and died. A 1926 article discussed the case of a child who had died from\nlead poisoning after she “gnawed” lead paint off her bed. A 1933 article pointed out that\n“children get exposed to lead-based paint in the homes by their common tendency to put\nthings in their mouth[s].” It also stated that most cases involved infants and small children\nand that children were more susceptible to lead poisoning than adults. Another 1933 article\nnoted: “It must be obvious that for every child who becomes paralysed by lead there must\nbe literally hundreds who have been affected by the poison in some more or less minor\ndegree.” “[T]he extent of the lead paint menace has been minimized, and in consequence,\nliterally thousands of children have been allowed to run the risks of lead absorption.”\n\n\n\n\n12\n      In 1922, Queensland, Australia banned lead paint from areas to which young children\nhad access.\n13\n        Plaintiff presented an expert who testified that in 1909 public health officials and\ndoctors were suggesting that there be legislation banning lead paint due to the risk of\nexposure for children. This expert cited his own 2005 article in which he asserted that\nresearchers had stated in 1909 that “[p]aint containing lead should never be employed where\nchildren, especially young children, are accustomed to play,” and “[a] number of European\ncountries banned lead-based paint soon thereafter.” He also relied on a seven-page\n“annotated bibliography” that he had prepared, which listed, but did not include, numerous\narticles that he had reviewed.\n                                              6\n\f       Published medical articles in this era recognized that even small amounts of lead\ncould cause children to suffer harm. A 1931 British Medical Journal article discussed the\n“insidious” effects of “infinitesimal doses of lead” over a long period of time. A 1935\nAmerican medical journal article suggested that there were “insidious” “cumulative effects\nof infinitesimal doses of lead” that could be “obscure.” A 1938 British medical article\nstated that “the harmful effects of continued small doses of lead begin from the moment the\nlead is absorbed” and can lead to a long series of “subtle” harms. It opined that “there is no\nthreshold below which still smaller doses can be regarded as being without some adverse\neffect.” A 1943 American medical journal article discussed the impact of early childhood\nsubacute lead poisoning on a child’s intelligence and subsequent academic achievement; it\ncalled for a ban on interior residential use of lead paint.\n       Knowledge about the toxic properties of lead paint was not limited to the medical\nprofession. In May 1910, the United States House of Representatives’ Committee on\nInterstate and Foreign Commerce held a hearing on a bill aimed at preventing lead\npoisoning. The bill would have required products containing white lead to “be labeled\nconspicuously and securely with a skull and crossbones and the words: ‘White lead:\npoison.’ ” The sponsor of the bill noted that France had already “entirely prohibited the use\nof white lead because of its injurious character” and that “all countries of Europe” had\nalready enacted legislation like his proposal. He spoke of “the injurious effect of these\natoms of white lead that are filling the air now; they come loose from doors, from window\nsills, from everywhere, we inhale them and consequently disease is caused which physicians\ndo not understand and can not say what it really is, but it is, in many cases, simply a case of\nlead poisoning.” Another proponent of the bill observed that “the most eminent scientists\nand doctors of Great Britain” had “found that the small particles that result from chalking,\nespecially from internal painting and external painting as well, when taken by inhalation\ninto the lungs, are absorbed and become a poison to the system.” This congressional\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fhearing was attended by an attorney for “practically all of the paint manufacturers of this\ncountry” who stated their opposition to the proposal. The bill failed.\n       A few years later, in 1914, Henry Gardner, who was the assistant director of the\nInstitute of Industrial Research and also the director of the Paint Manufacturers\nAssociation’s Educational Bureau, published a speech that he had given to the International\nAssociation of Master House Painters and Decorators of the United States and Canada at\nthat association’s annual convention in February 1914. In this speech, Gardner\nacknowledged that “the presence of [white lead] dust in the atmosphere of a room is very\ndangerous to the health of the inmates” and that “[l]ead poisoning may occur through\ninhalation of [lead] dust . . . .”\n       Despite this evidence of the toxic properties of white lead, the main use for white\n                                                       14\nlead in the 20th century was as a pigment for paint.        NL, SWC, and ConAgra’s\npredecessor, Fuller, were among the handful of companies that manufactured white lead\ncarbonate pigments during the 20th century, and all three of them used white lead carbonate\npigment to make paint. NL, SWC, and Fuller were all leaders in the lead paint industry, and\nthey knew at that time that lead dust was poisonous. They were also aware that lead paint\n“powders and chalks” “soon after it is applied” and routinely produces lead dust after a\ncouple of years.\n       In 1922, NL, SWC, and Fuller were making white lead carbonate pigment, using it in\ntheir paints, and promoting white lead pigment in paint for use on and in residential homes.\nSales of white lead peaked in 1922. There was a decrease in the use of lead paint in the\n1920s and early 1930s. By 1944, during World War II, the use of lead paint for residential\ninteriors had declined to a low level.\n\n\n\n\n14\n       Plaintiff’s experts defined “lead-based paint” as either paint containing lead pigment\nor paint that was “either considered 100 percent or 70 percent pure white lead . . . or\nalternatively mixed paint with . . . ‘high-lead content.’ ”\n                                              8\n\f       NL manufactured white lead carbonate pigment from 1891 to 1978, and it had\nmanufacturing facilities in San Francisco and Los Angeles that manufactured white lead\ncarbonate pigments in California between 1900 and 1972. It sold those pigments to\nCalifornia paint manufacturers, used them in its own paint products sold in California, and\nadvertised and promoted paint products containing those pigments for residential use within\nthe 10 jurisdictions during that same period. NL “kept up with the medical literature” about\nlead poisoning. NL’s 1912 annual report acknowledged that lead dust was a “danger to the\nhealth” of workers exposed to it in the making of white lead. By the mid to late 1920s, NL\nknew that children who chewed on things painted with lead paint could get lead poisoning\nand die from it. Nevertheless, NL’s lead paints were marketed for residential use and sold\nin and advertised in the 10 jurisdictions between 1900 and 1972. NL produced a handbook\nfor consumers in 1950 that instructed them to use lead paint on the interiors of their homes.\n       ConAgra’s predecessor, Fuller, manufactured white lead carbonate pigment from\n1894 until at least 1958. Fuller manufactured white lead carbonate pigment at its San\nFrancisco factory until 1898, when it moved its factory to South San Francisco. At this\nfactory, Fuller refined white lead carbonate and was a “major producer” of lead paint.\nFuller also had a plant in Los Angeles. Fuller’s lead paints were sold at its own stores and\n                                                                        15\nby independent dealers in all 10 jurisdictions between 1894 and 1961.        Fuller knew that\nlead dust was poisonous. In 1919, an article about Fuller’s South San Francisco plant noted\nthat lead dust is poisonous.\n       SWC began manufacturing paints containing white lead carbonate pigments in 1880.\nSWC’s internal publication, The Chameleon, published an article in 1900 that\nacknowledged the many dangers of lead paint. It stated: “A familiar characteristic of white\nlead is its tendency to crumble from the surface, popularly known as chalking”; “It is also\nfamiliarly known that white lead is a deadly cumulative poison”; and “This noxious quality\n\n\n15\n       Fuller also produced and sold non-lead paints.\n                                              9\n\fbecomes serious in a paint that disintegrates and is blown about by the wind.” In 1910,\nSWC bought a lead mine, which it utilized to manufacture white lead carbonate pigment\nfrom 1910 to 1947 for use in its own paints. SWC stopped manufacturing white lead\n                                                                     16\ncarbonate in 1947, but it continued to make lead paint until 1958.        SWC had plants in\nEmeryville and later in Los Angeles that manufactured paint containing white lead\ncarbonate. SWC continued to sell lead paint until 1972. SWC removed all lead from its\nresidential paints by the end of 1972.\n       Two trade associations, the Lead Industries Association (LIA) and the National\nPaint, Varnish, and Lacquer Association (NPVLA) promoted the use of lead paint. Fuller,\nNL, and SWC were members of both the LIA and the NPVLA. The LIA, which was\ncreated in 1928, promoted the use of white lead pigments in residential paint by sponsoring\ntwo advertising campaigns, the Forest Products Better Paint campaign and the White Lead\nPromotion campaign, in the first half of the 20th century. The LIA knew that white lead\nwas being attacked from “a health standpoint,” and these campaigns were designed to\nincrease the consumption of lead.\n       The LIA provided its members with information about lead hazards and lead\npoisoning that was available in medical and scientific literature at the time. NL was present\nat a 1930 LIA board of directors meeting at which a 1930 article about lead poisoning of\nbabies and children from chewing lead paint off of cribs was discussed. The article, which\nran in the U.S. Daily, a publication “Presenting the Official News” of the government,\nstated that lead poisoning from “chewing paint from toys, cradles, and woodwork” was “a\nmore frequent occurrence” than previously thought and noted that even a small amount of\nlead could kill a child. The article also noted that “[c]hildren are very susceptible to lead”\nand that the “most common sources of lead poisoning in children are paint on various\nobjects within reach of a child and lead pipes . . . .”\n\n\n16\n       Some of SWC’s paints did not contain white lead pigment.\n                                                10\n\f        In 1934, the LIA launched its Forest Products campaign, which promoted lead paint\nfor interior residential use. At a 1935 LIA annual meeting, it was acknowledged that\nchildhood lead poisoning disproportionately affected poor and minority children and that\nthere were thousands of cases annually. Yet the LIA fought against the imposition of\nregulations on lead. A 1937 LIA conference on lead poisoning was attended by\nrepresentatives from NL and SWC, and Fuller received a transcript of the conference. Both\nindustrial lead poisoning and childhood lead poisoning were discussed at the 1937\nconference. There was discussion of research that showed it was nearly impossible to get\nrid of lead once it got into a child’s body. Attendees at the conference were asked by the\nhead of the LIA not to discuss what they learned at the conference in order to avoid\nunfavorable publicity connecting lead paint to lead poisoning. The LIA’s Forest Products\ncampaign continued through 1941.\n        The NPVLA, unlike the LIA, represented paint manufacturers regardless of whether\n                           17\nthey used lead pigments.         The NPVLA ran advertising campaigns promoting paint\nthroughout the first half of the 20th century. One was called Save the Surface in 1920 and\n1921. The other was called Clean Up Paint Up and was ongoing in 1949. All three\ncompanies were involved in both advertising campaigns. Neither of the NPVLA’s\ncampaigns distinguished between lead paint and non-lead paint, but these campaigns\nincluded advertisements promoting all three companies’ lead paint products.\n        Lead paint was banned in the United States in 1978.

In 1991, the\nCenters for Disease Control (the CDC) set the “level of concern” for lead at a blood lead\n                                18\nlevel (BLL) of 10 mcg/dL.            In 2012, the CDC replaced this standard with a “reference\n\n\n17\n     Fuller was a member of the NPVLA from 1933 to 1962. NL was an NPVLA\nmember from 1933 to 1977. SWC was a member of the NPVLA from 1933 to 1981.\n18\n        The impact of blood lead levels below 10 mcg/dL was not well understood until\n2005.\n                                                    11\n\fvalue” of 5 mcg/dL, which represents the top 2.5 percent of BLLs in children under the age\nof five. “[T]he reference value simply denotes the worst or the highest exposed children in\na population.” At that point, national data reflected that 5.3 percent of children living in\npre-1950 housing had BLLs exceeding that value, while only 0.4 percent of children living\nin post-1978 housing had BLLs exceeding that value.\n       In 1995, the California Legislature enacted the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention\nAct of 1991. (Health & Saf. Code, §§ 105275, 124125; Stats. 1995, ch. 415, § 8.) This act\ncreated the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP). (Health & Saf. Code,\n§ 124125.) The Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch (CLPPB), a division of\nCalifornia’s Department of Public Health, was accorded the role of coordinating the state’s\napproach to childhood lead exposure and childhood lead poisoning. The CLPPB devotes its\nresources to outreach, education, case management programs to track those who have been\nlead poisoned or exposed to lead, and programs to address lead hazards. The CLPPB also\ncontracts with and supervises 43 county CLPPPs.\n       The CLPPB focuses on children who are one or two years old. Health care providers\nare required to order that a child be screened for lead poisoning at age one and at age two if\n“the child receives services from a publicly funded program for low-income children.”\n(Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 37100.) Medical laboratories are required to report all BLLs to\nthe CLPPB. (Health & Saf. Code, § 124130; Stats. 2002, ch. 931, § 11.) The CLPPB\nconsiders it a “case” of lead poisoning if a child’s BLL exceeds 19.5 mcg/dL or persistently\nexceeds 14.5 mcg/dL. In such cases, a public health nurse and an environmental health\nspecialist visit the child’s home to try to determine potential sources of the lead poisoning.\n       National average BLLs have declined precipitously since the 1970s, falling by about\n90 percent. In 1980, it was estimated that 88.3 percent of children had BLLs in excess of 10\nmcg/dL. By 2008, it was estimated that less than one percent of children had BLLs over 10\n\n\n\n\n                                               12\n\f          19\nmcg/dL.        Nevertheless, in 2010, around 22,000 children under the age of six in California\nhad BLLs over 4.5 mcg/dL. And at the time of trial in 2013, California had more than\n2,000 children with BLLs over 10 mcg/dL and more than 15,000 additional children with\nBLLs over 5 mcg/dL. Children in California with BLLs over 9.5 mcg/dL represented 0.35\n                                     20\npercent of California’s children.\n       Children in the 10 jurisdictions are continuing to be exposed to lead from the lead\npaint in their homes and to suffer deleterious effects from that lead. Although only a small\npercentage of the children in these jurisdictions are screened for lead, thousands of children\nare found to have BLLs of concern each year.\n       Lead poisoning from lead paint is “the number one environmental children’s\nhealth issue in Alameda County.” The primary cause of lead poisoning in Alameda County\nis lead paint. About 75 percent of Alameda County’s homes are pre-1980, which amounts\nto 430,000 units. Nearly 174,000 of those units are pre-1950. Alameda County is able to\nscreen only 46 percent of the children under the age of six who are poor and live in pre-\n1978 homes. Alameda County’s CLPPP opens a case only when there is a lead-poisoned\nchild with a BLL of 20 mcg/dL or two BLLs of 15 mcg/dL. In 2012, 14 children met that\nstandard in Alameda County. That triggers an investigation of the home and education of\nthe parents about sources of exposure. There is no funding for remediation. Alameda\nCounty’s CLPPP also tries to do outreach and education to families with children who have\n                                21\nBLLs of 5 mcg/dL or higher, but there is no funding for dealing with these children. In\n2010, there were 14 children in that category.\n\n\n\n19\n      The prevalence of elevated BLLs in children under the age of six in California\nappeared to have declined 60 percent from 2003 to 2010.\n20\n     Because the laboratories doing the tests lack the ability to report precise results,\nBLLs of 4.5 are rounded up to 5 and BLLs of 9.5 are rounded up to 10.\n21\n       The limits of detection do not permit such precise measurement, so the CLPPP\nactually provides these services when the BLL is over 4.5 mcg/dL.\n                                                13\n\f       Lead poisoning is the top pediatric environmental health problem in Los Angeles\nCounty. The most common source of lead poisoning in Los Angeles County is lead paint\nchips and lead paint dust. Lead paint is a “severe environmental health concern” in Los\nAngeles County. In Los Angeles County, 77 percent of the housing was built before 1978,\nwhich is more than 2.6 million housing units. More than 900,000 of those housing units are\npre-1950. Los Angeles County’s investigators have often found lead paint dust in homes\nwith intact lead paint. In 2010, Los Angeles County had about 6,500 children under the age\nof six with BLLs of greater than 4.5 mcg/dl. Los Angeles County’s CLPPP generally does\nnot do “primary prevention” but only screening and “secondary prevention.” Los Angeles\nCounty’s CLPPP handles about 75 to 100 cases of lead poisoning each year. In at least 75\npercent of those cases, lead paint is a potential source of the lead poisoning. At least 70\npercent of those cases involve pre-1978 housing.\n       Lead paint is a serious environmental health concern in Monterey County. In\nMonterey County, 66 percent of the housing was built before 1980, which accounts for\nbetween 89,000 and 90,000 units. Between 18,000 and 19,000 of those units were built\nbefore 1950. Each year, Monterey County’s CLPPP receives between 13 and 15 new cases\nwhere there has been a report of a BLL of 20 mcg/dL or two BLLs of 14.5 mcg/dL or\ngreater. The children are generally between the ages of one and three. For those cases, it\nconducts a full assessment of the home. Each month Monterey County receives 10 to 20\nreports of a child with a BLL of 4.5 mcg/dL or higher. A substantial number of cases of\nlead poisoning in Monterey County have been attributed to imported foods.\n       Lead-based paint hazards in Oakland homes are “coming close to crisis mode.” In\nOakland, 80 to 90 percent of the housing is pre-1978, which accounts for about 174,000\nunits. Each year, Oakland’s Lead Safe Housing Program receives 16 to 20 referrals from\nAlameda County’s CLPPP to assess homes where lead-poisoned children live.\n       In the City of San Diego, 60.5 percent of the housing was built before 1980. There\nare about 300,000 pre-1978 housing units of which more than 62,000 are pre-1950. The\n\n                                              14\n\fCity of San Diego has a Lead Safety Healthy Homes Program that offers education,\noutreach, risk assessments, and lead inspections. More than half of the 2,700 lead\ninspections completed in the City of San Diego between 2005 and 2013 identified lead\nhazards.\n       In San Francisco, 94 percent of the homes were built before 1978, which is more\nthan 317,000 housing units, and 68 percent were built before 1950, which is more than\n235,000 housing units. About 22,000 housing units in San Francisco that are occupied by\nlow and moderate income families are believed to have lead-based paint hazards. San\nFrancisco’s CLPPP contacts parents when a child tests at 2 mcg/dL or higher. Only very\ninfrequently is the source of the child’s lead exposure anything other than lead paint. In\n2010, when San Francisco tested 10,300 children under the age of six, 959 children tested\nbetween 4.5 and 9.5 mcg/dL, and 35 tested higher. Since 2010, San Francisco has been\n“seeing increasing numbers” of lead exposed children. Each year, San Francisco issues\nabout 200 notices to correct lead paint and soil lead hazards.\n       The number one source of lead poisoning in San Mateo County is lead paint. Lead\npaint in pre-1978 housing is a public health problem in San Mateo County. This includes\nintact lead paint because it will inevitably deteriorate. In San Mateo County, 80 to 90\npercent of the housing is pre-1978, which is more than 200,000 housing units. More than\n56,000 of those units are pre-1950.\n       “[L]ead paint is the number one environmental cause of poisoning of children in\nSanta Clara County” and is a threat to public health there. In Santa Clara County, two-\nthirds of the housing stock is pre-1978, which is more than 426,000 housing units. More\nthan 61,000 of those are pre-1950. Although in 2010 Santa Clara County could only afford\nto test less than 20 percent of the more than 150,000 children under the age of six who lived\nin the county, 339 of them had BLLs between 4.5 mcg/dL and 9.5 mcg/dL, and 71 had\nBLLs over 9.5 mcg/dL. Most of the children with elevated BLLs lived in pre-1978 housing.\n“[O]nce those children are determined to be lead poisoned, it is too late.”\n\n                                              15\n\f       Lead poisoning of children is a “very significant problem” in Solano County, and it\n“causes substantial harm even at the lowest levels of exposure” such as 5 mcg/dL. “The\nharm is very substantial, the harm is permanent. Children’s IQs are affected . . . they have\nimpairment of memory, difficulty with problem solving, inattentiveness . . . .” Only about\n20 percent of the 32,000 children under age six in Solano County are tested for lead. This is\ndue to lack of access to medical care for poor children. In 2010, at least 100 children in\nSolano County had BLLs over 4.5 mcg/dL. Between 2001 and 2012, the sole source of lead\nexposure was lead paint for 55 percent of the children in Solano County with a BLL of 20\nmcg/dL or higher or two BLLs of 15 mcg/dL. In many of the other cases, lead paint was a\ncontributing source. Between 75,000 and 80,000 homes in Solano County were built before\n1978, which is about 51 percent of all of the homes. More than 18,000 of those units are\npre-1950. Solano County has no resources for code enforcement of lead paint hazards in\nhomes or for remediation.\n       Ventura County has almost 174,000 pre-1978 housing units. Almost 20,000 of those\nare pre-1950. In 2010, Ventura County had 34 children with BLLs higher than 10 mcg/dL\nand 271 children with BLLs over 5 mcg/dL. Ventura County’s CLPPP does not do any\nenvironmental investigation as to children with BLLs between 5 and 15 mcg/dL. For those\nchildren, Ventura’s CLPPP provides only educational material.\n       The CLPPPs lack the ability to engage in primary prevention, which seeks to prevent\nlead exposure in the first place. Instead, the CLPPPs largely target children who have\nalready been exposed to lead. Abatement would be primary prevention. Although it is not\nfeasible to remove all lead from every home in the 10 jurisdictions, primary prevention\ncould be substantially furthered by lead inspections, risk assessments, education, and\nremediation of identified lead hazards in homes in the 10 jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f                                II. Defense Evidence At Trial\n       BLLs in children under the age of six nationally have been dropping since the 1970s,\ngoing from a geometric mean of 15 mcg/dL in the late 1970s to 1 mcg/dL in 2009/2010.\nThe percentage of children under the age of six with BLLs exceeding 10 mcg/dL has\ndropped over that period from more than 80 percent to less than one-half of one percent. A\nsimilar drop has occurred for children under the age of six with BLLs over 5 mcg/dL. The\nsame is true in the western region, which includes California, where the geometric mean for\nBLLs is about 25 to 30 percent lower than in other regions. In most of the 10 jurisdictions,\nBLLs and the percentage of elevated BLLs also dropped from 2007 to 2012.\n       A defense expert testified that the lower BLLs reflected decreasing exposure of\nchildren to lead. It was his opinion that leaded gasoline was largely responsible for both\nsoil lead and dust lead and that there was “very little impact of exposure to lead from paint\non community-wide blood lead levels.”\n       Another defense expert testified that the current understanding of childhood lead\npoisoning was unknown before 1970. In his view, the amount of lead considered toxic and\nawareness of “the pathway by which lead gets into the child’s body” had both “changed\nradically over the years.” He asserted that in the first decade of the 20th century lead\npoisoning was considered an “industrial disease of adults.” No tests were available to\nmeasure a BLL. It was not until the 1930s that a BLL test became available. This defense\nexpert testified that, prior to 1920, there were no cases in the United States of a child\ningesting lead paint from a household surface. By 1940, interior use of lead paint was\ndwindling. In 1951, Baltimore banned lead paint for interior use. In 1953, there was a\ngeneral call for lead paint not to be used for interiors.\n       This defense expert testified that in 1971, the medical community’s understanding\nwas that lead poisoning did not cause significant symptoms until the BLL exceeded 60\nmcg/dL. In 1970, the United States Surgeon General determined that a BLL of 40 mcg/dL\nshould be considered “evidence suggestive of undue absorption of lead . . . .” It was not\n\n                                                17\n\frecognized until 1974 that children could consume lead originating from lead paint from\nhousehold dust, rather than only from flakes and chips. In 1985, the CDC set an\n“intervention level” for BLLs at 25 mcg/dL. In 1991, the CDC set the “level of concern”\nfor BLLs at 10 mcg/dL.\n       A defense epidemiologist testified that it was not clear even in 2003 whether BLLs\nbelow 10 mcg/dL produced cognitive deficits. This expert testified that a subsequent study\nauthored by one of plaintiff’s experts showing such deficits was flawed. This expert had\nnot studied childhood lead exposure, but he testified that the evidence was inconclusive\nwhether there were cognitive effects of BLLs below 10 mcg/dL.\n       SWC presented a statistician who testified that SWC had contributed only 6,732 tons\nof lead to California over the period from 1894 to 2009 out of a total of 217,784 tons of lead\nconsumed in California during that period, which was just “.1 percent” of the total lead. On\ncross-examination, he conceded that his estimate was limited to lead manufactured by SWC\nbetween 1910 and 1947, which was the only period when SWC manufactured lead. SWC\ncontinued to make lead paint after 1947. His estimate was also based primarily on national\ndata about lead consumption to which he had applied a ratio based solely on population to\ndetermine what he thought was California’s consumption.\n       Another defense expert testified that lead paint does not inevitably deteriorate. He\nasserted that if lead paint is “maintained properly and re-coated as needed on a regular\nmaintenance cycle,” it will not deteriorate. His premise was that repainting would be\nneeded every three to five years. On cross-examination, he admitted that lead paint would\ndeteriorate over time, particularly on friction surfaces like windows. He also admitted that\nrepainting would require surface preparation, which would often mean sanding or scraping,\nin order to provide a surface to which the new paint would adhere.\n       The defense’s abatement expert testified that the replacement of windows and doors\nthat have been painted with lead paint is “a very intrusive and disruptive process” that\ninvolves “guys in moon suits, [and] respirators.” That process can disturb other hazardous\n\n                                              18\n\fwaste, such as asbestos, and lead to the discovery of mold issues. The remediation of floors\nand soil would also be invasive, labor intensive, and time consuming. He also suggested\nthat the abatement plan’s cost estimates for remediation were unrealistically low. He\nbelieved that remediation would often take a week or more and could increase the risk of\nlead exposure for the residents of the home. He also testified that replacing windows does\nnot lower BLLs and that remediation can result in higher BLLs.\n\n\n                                     III. Procedural Background\n       In March 2011, plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint (FAC) for public\n            22\nnuisance.        It named as defendants ConAgra, NL, SWC, Atlantic Richfield Company\n                                                                                             23\n(ARCO), E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), and 50 Doe defendants.                      The\nFAC alleged that the presence of lead in homes was a public nuisance and that defendants\nwere “liable in public nuisance” because they had created or assisted in the creation of this\n                    24\npublic nuisance.         Plaintiff sought abatement, injunctive relief, costs, and attorney’s fees.\nThe parties stipulated that the FAC concerned only residential buildings and no public\nbuildings.\n       The court struck defendants’ jury demands, and the case was tried to the court in July\nand August 2013. In March 2014, the court issued an amended statement of decision and an\namended judgment. The court’s amended statement of decision, which was over 100 pages\n\n\n22\n       We need not discuss at length the long and complicated procedural history of this\ncase, which was originally filed in 2000. This case has already produced one published\ndecision by this court (Santa Clara I, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">) and another by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court (County of Santa Clara v. Superior Court (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630965\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630965/county-of-santa-clara-v-superior-court-of-santa-clara-cnty/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Santa Clara II)). We will discuss these decisions only where they are relevant to the issues\nbefore us in this appeal.\n23\n        The trial court found that ARCO and DuPont were not liable, and they are not parties\nto this appeal.\n24\n      Defendants’ demurrer to the FAC was overruled. The court also denied summary\njudgment motions by NL and SWC.\n                                                    19\n\flong, made numerous findings. The court expressly found that, “[s]ince antiquity, it has\nbeen well known that lead is highly toxic and causes severe health consequences when\ningested” and that “[e]ven relatively low levels of lead exposure have severe health\nconsequences.” It found that lead paint is prevalent in the 10 jurisdictions, “inevitably\ndeteriorates,” and is the primary source of lead exposure for young children living in pre-\n1978 housing in the 10 jurisdictions. As a result, children in these jurisdictions are\ncontinuing to be exposed to lead from lead paint even though residential lead paint was\nbanned in 1978. The court expressly found that ConAgra, NL, and SWC each had “actual\nknowledge of the hazards of lead paint,” “including childhood lead poisoning,” when they\npromoted lead paint for interior residential use. The court’s judgment required defendants\nto pay $1.15 billion into an abatement fund that would pay for lead inspections, education\nabout lead hazards, and remediation of particular lead hazards inside residences in the 10\n                                                            25\njurisdictions. Defendants timely filed notices of appeal.\n\n\n                                        IV. Discussion\n                               A. Substantial Evidence Issues\n       A public nuisance cause of action is established by proof that a defendant knowingly\ncreated or assisted in the creation of a substantial and unreasonable interference with a\npublic right. (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 305-306.)\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to produce substantial evidence in support of\nits public nuisance cause of action. They assert that substantial evidence does not support\nthe trial court’s findings that (1) they had actual knowledge of the public health hazard\nposed by interior use of lead paint at the time they promoted and distributed it; (2) they\npromoted lead paint for interior use; (3) their conduct caused the public nuisance to occur;\n\n\n\n\n25\n       Plaintiff also appealed, but it later dismissed its appeal.\n                                               20\n\fand (4) the nuisance is abatable, lead paint poses an imminent danger, and abatement will\nlower BLLs.\n                                    1. Standard of Review\n       Defendants contend that their claims that substantial evidence does not support the\ntrial court’s judgment raise questions of law that we must review de novo. They cite Smith\nv. Selma Community Hosp. (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1478</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Smith) as support for this\ncontention. Smith is inapposite. In Smith, the Court of Appeal was reviewing a governing\nboard’s decision reviewing a judicial review committee’s decision. The board, which was\nexercising substantial evidence review, concluded that the committee’s decision was not\nsupported by substantial evidence. Since the Court of Appeal was reviewing the board’s\ndecision that substantial evidence did not support the committee’s decision, the Court of\nAppeal necessarily exercised independent review. (Smith, at pp. 1515-1516.) As we are not\nreviewing another reviewing body’s decision as to whether a third body’s decision was\nsupported by substantial evidence, we do not exercise independent review. Instead, we\nexercise ordinary deferential substantial evidence review.\n       “ ‘When a finding of fact is attacked on the ground that there is not any substantial\nevidence to sustain it, the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the\ndetermination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted\nwhich will support the finding of fact.’ ” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon (1971) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158810\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158810/foreman-clark-corp-v-fallon/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881.) “ ‘[W]e have no power to judge of the effect or value of the evidence, to weigh\nthe evidence, to consider the credibility of the witnesses, or to resolve conflicts in the\nevidence or in the reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom.’ ” (Leff v. Gunter\n(1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1174077\"><a href=\"/opinion/1174077/leff-v-gunter/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 518.) Our role is limited to determining whether the evidence before\nthe trier of fact supports its findings. (Reddy v. Gonzalez (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123.)\n       Defendants claim that we may not presume implied findings in plaintiff’s favor\nbecause there were “key ambiguities” in the trial court’s statement of decision that they\nbrought to the court’s attention but the court did not resolve.\n\n                                               21\n\f       “When a statement of decision does not resolve a controverted issue, or if the\nstatement is ambiguous and the record shows that the omission or ambiguity was brought to\nthe attention of the trial court . . . , it shall not be inferred on appeal . . . that the trial court\ndecided in favor of the prevailing party as to those facts or on that issue.” (Code Civ. Proc.,\n§ 634.) “To bring defects in a statement of decision to the trial court’s attention within the\nmeaning of section 634, objections to a statement of decision must be ‘specific.’ [Citation.]\nThe alleged omission or ambiguity must be identified with sufficient particularity to allow\nthe trial court to correct the defect. [Citation.] ‘By filing specific objections to the court’s\nstatement of decision a party pinpoints alleged deficiencies in the statement and allows the\ncourt to focus on the facts or issues the party contends were not resolved or whose\nresolution is ambiguous.’ ” (Ermoian v. Desert Hospital (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">475</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 498.)\n“[A] trial court is not required to respond point by point to issues posed in a request for a\nstatement of decision. ‘ “The court’s statement of decision is sufficient if it fairly discloses\nthe court’s determination as to the ultimate facts and material issues in the case.”\n[Citations.]’ ” (Id. at p. 500.)\n       After trial, each defendant submitted a proposed statement of decision, and plaintiff\nsubmitted proposed findings of fact and law and a proposed order. In December 2013, the\ncourt issued a proposed statement of decision. Plaintiff and defendants filed objections to\nthe proposed statement of decision. The court subsequently filed an amended statement of\n                                        26\ndecision and an amended judgment.\n       Defendants’ appellate briefs identify six “key ambiguities” that they assert they\nbrought to the court’s attention but the court failed to address in its statement of decision.\n\n\n26\n       In January 2014, the court issued a statement of decision. Plaintiff submitted a\nproposed judgment, and defendants objected to the proposed judgment. The court entered\njudgment followed by an amended judgment. Defendants moved to vacate the judgment\nand for a new trial. The court denied the motions for new trial and to vacate the judgment.\nPlaintiff moved to modify the statement of decision and the judgment, and the court filed an\namended statement of decision and a second amended judgment.\n                                                   22\n\fThe alleged “ambiguities” they identify are: (1) “Whether the court found any part of\ndefendants’ recitation of the historical knowledge of lead hazards to be incorrect;” (2)\n“What level of lead exposure the court referred to as being ‘lead poisoning’ ”; (3) “What\nfacts about lead’s hazards the court found that defendants ‘actually knew’ ”; (4) “Which of\ndefendants’ promotions for interior paint the court found to be a basis for liability”; (5) “On\nwhat basis the court included housing built after 1950”; and (6) “what public rights.”\n       “[I]t is settled that the trial court need not, in a statement to decision, ‘address all the\nlegal and factual issues raised by the parties.’ [Citation.] It ‘is required only to set out\nultimate findings rather than evidentiary ones.’ [Citation.] ‘ “[U]ltimate fact[]” ’ is a\nslippery term, but in general it refers to a core fact, such as an element of a claim or defense,\nwithout which the claim or defense must fail. [Citation.] It is distinguished conceptually\nfrom ‘evidentiary facts’ and ‘conclusions of law.’ ” (Yield Dynamics, Inc. v. TEA Systems\nCorp. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 559.)\n       Only one of defendants’ six alleged “ambiguities” arguably pertains to a “core fact”\nrather than an evidentiary fact. SWC’s objections to the court’s proposed statement of\ndecision asked the court to “define ‘harmful’ ” with respect to defendants’ knowledge of\nlead’s harmful nature. SWC argued that this was important because the state of knowledge\nat the time defendants promoted lead paint did not include knowledge of the risks of low-\nlevel exposure to deteriorating lead paint. ConAgra adopted SWC’s objections and also\nasked the court to “specify what hazard it finds that Fuller knew when it promoted lead\npaint for residential interior use, and when Fuller knew exposure to lead at even minute\nlevels was harmful.” ConAgra requested that the court specify “what ‘harm’ each\ndefendant ‘knew.’ ” NL objected to the court’s proposed knowledge findings and asked that\nthe court “specifically identify the knowledge that NL had at that time.” We address the\ncourt’s treatment of the “harms” and “hazards” issue in the course of our analysis of\ndefendants’ challenge to the court’s knowledge findings. In all other respects, we reject\n\n\n\n                                                23\n\fdefendants’ claim that the court failed to resolve an ambiguity as to a “core fact” because\nwe conclude that the alleged ambiguities concerned evidentiary facts.\n       Before we embark on our substantial evidence review, we note that we cannot rely\nsolely on the expert testimony produced by plaintiff. Plaintiff’s expert witnesses testified to\nconclusions that would appear on their face to establish both the actual knowledge and\npromotion elements of plaintiff’s case. One of plaintiff’s experts testified: “These\nDefendants manufactured white lead carbonate; these Defendants knew of the hazards of\nlead during the time that they were manufacturing white lead carbonate; these Defendants\nadvertised, promoted, and sold their lead and/or lead [based] products while they had\nknowledge of the hazards of lead; these Defendants advertised, promoted, and sold their\nlead and/or lead containing products for use in and around homes within each of the 10\njurisdictions; suitable substitutes were available for white lead; these Defendants, through\ntheir trade association, downplayed the hazards of lead; and these Defendants, through their\ntrade associations, fought the imposition of regulations.” And plaintiff’s experts testified to\neven more specific conclusions: “Sherwin-Williams had actual knowledge about the\nhazards of lead as early as 1900.”\n       If we could accept plaintiff’s expert witnesses’ testimony at face value, this\ntestimony would itself support the trial court’s findings. However, we may not do so.\n“ ‘The chief value of an expert’s testimony in this field, as in all other fields, rests upon the\nmaterial from which his opinion is fashioned and the reasoning by which he progresses\nfrom his material to his conclusion; . . . it does not lie in his mere expression of\n              27\nconclusion.’ ”     (People v. Bassett (1968) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141.) “Where an expert bases his\n\n\n27\n       The material upon which the expert relies may provide substantial evidence to\nsupport the expert’s conclusion. However, there are limitations on an expert’s testimony\nabout that material. “What an expert cannot do is relate as true case-specific facts asserted\nin hearsay statements, unless they are independently proven by competent evidence or are\ncovered by a hearsay exception.” (People v. Sanchez (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">665</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 686.) We will\nconsider defendants’ hearsay challenges in section IV(J)(1) of this opinion.\n                                                24\n\fconclusion upon assumptions which are not supported by the record, upon matters which\nare not reasonably relied upon [by] other experts, or upon factors which are speculative,\nremote or conjectural, then his conclusion has no evidentiary value. [Citations.] In those\ncircumstances the expert’s opinion cannot rise to the dignity of substantial evidence.\n[Citation.] When a trial court has accepted an expert’s ultimate conclusion without critical\nconsideration of his reasoning and it appears the conclusion was based upon improper or\nunwarranted matters, then the judgment must be reversed for lack of substantial evidence.”\n(Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Zuckerman (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1135-1136.) “If\n[the expert’s] opinion is not based upon facts otherwise proved, or assumes facts contrary to\nthe only proof, it cannot rise to the dignity of substantial evidence.” (Estate of Powers\n(1947) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485-486.)\n       Consequently, a conclusion expressed by an expert cannot provide by itself\nsubstantial evidence to support a finding unless the basis for the expert’s conclusion is itself\nsupported by substantial evidence. Our substantial evidence review must include a critical\nexamination of the material upon which the experts based their conclusions in order to\ndetermine whether that material provides substantial support for those conclusions.\n                                    2. Actual Knowledge\n       Defendants claim that the trial court did not find actual knowledge, but only\nconstructive knowledge, and that its knowledge findings are not supported by substantial\nevidence.\n       Constructive knowledge would not be sufficient to support plaintiff’s public nuisance\ncause of action. The standard set by this court in Santa Clara I is actual knowledge, not\nconstructive knowledge. “[L]iability is premised on defendants’ promotion of lead paint for\ninterior use with knowledge of the hazard that such use would create. This conduct is\ndistinct from and far more egregious than simply producing a defective product or failing to\nwarn of a defective product . . . . [¶] A public nuisance cause of action is not premised on a\ndefect in a product or a failure to warn but on affirmative conduct that assisted in the\n\n                                               25\n\fcreation of a hazardous condition. Here, the alleged basis for defendants’ liability for the\npublic nuisance created by lead paint is their affirmative promotion of lead paint for interior\nuse, not their mere manufacture and distribution of lead paint or their failure to warn of its\nhazards.” (Santa Clara I, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 309-310, boldface & italics added.)\nBy tethering the public nuisance cause of action to affirmative promotion for a use\ndefendants knew to be hazardous, this court necessarily set forth an actual knowledge\nstandard. If the standard had been only constructive knowledge, the affirmative promotion\nof a product for a particular use that was hazardous would not have been “far more\negregious” than simply failing to warn of a defective product.\n       We reject defendants’ claim that the trial court did not find “actual knowledge.” The\ntrial court’s statement of decision expressly found that all three defendants had “actual\nknowledge of the hazards of lead paint—including childhood lead poisoning” when they\nproduced, marketed, sold, and promoted lead paint for residential use. It found: “ConAgra\nhad actual knowledge of the hazards of lead paint—including childhood lead poisoning—\nfor the duration of its production, marketing, and sale of lead pigments and paint for home\nuse”; “NL had actual knowledge of the hazards of lead paint, including childhood lead\npoisoning”; “SW[C] had actual knowledge of the hazards of lead paint—including\nchildhood lead poisoning—for the duration of its production, marketing, and sale of lead\npigments and lead paint for home use.”\n       While the standard we established in Santa Clara I is actual knowledge, our\nsubstantial evidence review remains deferential, and we must accept any reasonable\ninferences that the trial court drew from the evidence before it. The fact that the trial court\nwas required to find actual knowledge does not mean that the court could not rely\nexclusively on circumstantial evidence to support such a finding. The only limit on the trial\ncourt’s reliance on inferences from circumstantial evidence to establish actual knowledge is\nthat those inferences may not be speculative or conjectural. “ ‘ “Actual knowledge can be\ninferred from the circumstances only if, in the light of the evidence, such inference is not\n\n                                               26\n\fbased on speculation or conjecture. Only where the circumstances are such that the\ndefendant ‘must have known’ and not ‘should have known’ will an inference of actual\nknowledge be permitted.” [Citation.]’ ” (Romero v. Superior Court (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1068</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1082.) This distinction between what a defendant must have known and what a\ndefendant should have known is crucial. Proof of actual knowledge focuses on what\ninformation a defendant must have been aware of, while proof of constructive knowledge\nrests on a defendant’s duty to discover information.\n       We reject defendants’ claim that the court left undefined the nature of the “hazard” or\n“harm” that defendants had knowledge of when they promoted lead paint for interior\nresidential use. The court expressly found that defendants “learned about the harms of lead\nexposure through association-sponsored conferences.” It expressly found that defendants\nknew in the 1930s that “the dangers of lead paint to children were not limited to their toys,\nequipment, and furniture.” The court expressly found that defendants knew both that “high\nlevel exposure to lead—and, in particular, lead paint—was fatal” and that “lower level lead\nexposure harmed children.” The court also found that, by the 1920s, defendants knew that\n“lead paint used on the interiors of homes would deteriorate, and that lead dust resulting\nfrom this deterioration would poison children and cause serious injury.”\n       The trial court’s express findings made clear that the “harms” and “hazards” of\nwhich defendants had actual knowledge included that (1) “lower level lead exposure\nharmed children,” (2) “lead paint used on the interiors of homes would deteriorate,” and (3)\n“lead dust resulting from this deterioration would poison children and cause serious injury.”\nBecause the trial court made the express findings that defendants sought in their objections\nto the court’s proposed statement of decision, we are not precluded from drawing inferences\nin support of the trial court’s decision. In any case, the court’s express findings fully suffice\nto support its decision.\n       Here, the trial court properly focused on evidence of information that defendants\nmust have been aware of under the circumstances. This evidence was sufficient to support a\n\n                                               27\n\freasonable inference that each defendant must have known by the early 20th century that\ninterior residential lead paint posed a serious risk of harm to children.\n       First, evidence before the trial court established that, by 1914, it was well known in\nthe paint manufacturing industry that deteriorated lead paint on residential interiors,\nparticularly doors and windowsills, released “small particles” of lead into the air, which\nwere “very dangerous” to and could be ingested by humans and “poison” them.\n       In May 1910, the United States House of Representatives’ Committee on Interstate\nand Foreign Commerce held a hearing on a bill aimed at preventing lead poisoning. The\nbill would have required products containing white lead to “be labeled conspicuously and\nsecurely with a skull and crossbones and the words: ‘White lead: poison.’ ” Congressman\nRichard Bartholdt, who was the sponsor of the proposal, explained to the committee that\n“the painters of the United States,” who had originally opposed the proposal, had\n“practically all come around now” to supporting regulation of white lead. Bartholdt pointed\nout that France had already “entirely prohibited the use of white lead because of its injurious\ncharacter” and that “all countries of Europe” had already enacted legislation like his\nproposal.\n       Bartholdt explained: “We know very little of the injurious effect of these atoms of\nwhite lead that are filling the air now; they come loose from doors, from window sills, from\neverywhere, we inhale them and consequently disease is caused which physicians do not\nunderstand and can not say what it really is, but it is, in many cases, simply a case of lead\npoisoning.” One of the proponents of the bill told the committee that “the most eminent\nscientists and doctors of Great Britain” had “found that the small particles that result from\nchalking, especially from internal painting and external painting as well, when taken by\ninhalation into the lungs, are absorbed and become a poison to the system.” He also stated\nthat an “eminent scientist” in London had said that occupying a room that had been painted\nwith white lead was “dangerous.”\n\n\n\n                                               28\n\f       Eugene Philbin attended the hearing as “counsel for, I think, practically all of the\npaint manufacturers of this country—the leading ones,” to state their opposition to the\nproposal. Philbin said that he represented not only the “Paint Manufacturers’ Association”\nbut also the “National Paint, Oil, and Varnish Association.” Philbin objected to the “poison\nprovision” on the ground that it was “entirely unnecessary” and would “create a fear on the\npart of the consumer.” The bill failed.\n       A few years later, in 1914, Gardner, the director of the Paint Manufacturers\nAssociation’s Educational Bureau, published a speech that he had given to the International\nAssociation of Master House Painters and Decorators of the United States and Canada at\nthat association’s annual convention in February 1914. In this speech, Gardner\nacknowledged that “the presence of [white lead] dust in the atmosphere of a room is very\ndangerous to the health of the inmates.” He observed that “[l]ead poisoning may occur\nthrough inhalation of [lead] dust . . . .” Gardner suggested that “white lead flatted with\n                                                                                            28\nturpentine” was to blame for the disintegration of white lead paint into white lead dust.\nHowever, Gardner expressed the belief that “the use of flatted white lead has been largely\nabandoned for wall and ceiling decoration, and its place has been taken by the more sanitary\nleadless Flat Wall Paints.”\n       Notwithstanding Gardner’s belief, interior residential use of lead paint continued\nthroughout the first half of the 20th century despite widespread knowledge in the paint\nindustry of the toxic properties of white lead. NL, SWC, and Fuller were all leaders in the\nlead paint industry. SWC proclaimed itself in 1901 to be “the largest manufacturer of\nPrepared Paint in the world.” In 1934, SWC called itself the “World’s Largest Paint\nProducer” and identified itself as “one of the country’s largest producers of White Lead.”\n\n\n\n28\n       In 1914, it had long been a common practice to mix lead paint with turpentine. That\npractice did not end. Fuller’s 1931 White Lead Paint brochure instructed users to mix the\nlead paint with turpentine. NL’s 1950 Handbook on Painting recommended mixing lead\npaint with turpentine when painting interior woodwork.\n                                              29\n\fNL took pride in its position as a leader in the white lead industry since 1891. In 1912, NL\nmade more than 20 different brands of Dutch Boy White Lead for painting, the brand that it\nhad adopted in 1907. By the late 19th century, Fuller was the leading seller of white lead on\nthe West Coast and was “one of the strongest concerns dealing in paints, oils and glass in\nthe United States.”\n       NL, SWC, and Fuller, as leaders in the lead paint industry were well aware in the\nearly part of the 20th century that lead dust was poisonous. They were also aware that lead\npaint “powders and chalks” “soon after it is applied” and routinely produces lead dust after\na couple of years. Both the May 1910 congressional hearing and the published 1914 Paint\nManufacturing Association speech plainly discussed the dangers posed by interior\nresidential use of lead paint. Because defendants were leaders in the paint industry at that\ntime, they must have been aware of hazards related to their products that were well known\nin the paint industry. It is neither speculative nor conjectural to draw a reasonable inference\nthat leaders in the paint industry were aware of a serious hazard caused by their product\nwhen this hazard was generally known in their industry. Indeed, it would be unreasonable\nto infer that, notwithstanding general knowledge of the hazard of their products within the\nindustry, defendants somehow managed to avoid learning of this hazard.\n       Second, the reasonable inference arising from the 1910 and 1914 evidence of what\nwas generally known in the paint industry was further supported by evidence that Fuller,\nNL, and SWC were each the recipient of confirmatory information about this hazard from\nthe LIA in the 1930s. Each of the defendants was a member of the LIA in the 1930s when\nthe LIA promulgated information to its members about the “frequent occurrence” of\nchildren being poisoned by lead paint from “toys, cradles, and woodwork,” which included\nthe fact that even a small amount of lead could kill a child. The LIA information given to\nits members (including all three defendants) referenced a national newspaper article that had\nstated that “[c]hildren are very susceptible to lead” and that the “most common sources of\nlead poisoning in children are paint on various objects within reach of a child and lead\n\n                                              30\n\fpipes . . . .” Defendants, as the recipients of this information from the LIA, must have been\naware at that time, in the early 1930s, of the hazard to children created by the interior\nresidential use of lead paint. The fact that this information confirmed the prior information\nof which they also must have been aware served to solidify the foundation for the trial\ncourt’s actual knowledge findings.\n         All of this evidence provided substantial support for the trial court’s actual\nknowledge findings as to the three defendants under our deferential standard of review.\n“The fact that it is possible to draw some inference other than that drawn by the trier of fact\nis of no consequence. . . . We must therefore view the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference . . . .” (Jessup\nFarms v. Baldwin (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1119182\"><a href=\"/opinion/1119182/jessup-farms-v-baldwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 660.)\n         Here, the evidence, while circumstantial, was sufficient to support reasonable\ninferences that defendants must have known in the early 20th century that interior residential\nlead paint posed a serious risk of harm to children. Since these reasonable inferences\nsupport the trier of fact’s express findings that NL, SWC, and Fuller harbored the requisite\nactual knowledge, our deferential standard of review precludes us from drawing contrary\ninferences, and we must uphold the trial court’s actual knowledge findings.\n         ConAgra claims that there was no evidence that its predecessor, Fuller, knew in the\nearly 20th century that the use of lead paint in residential interiors would pose a public\nhealth hazard. It maintains that Fuller either did not know that children were consuming\nlead paint or knew of only “isolated cases” of such behavior that did not amount to a public\nhealth hazard. ConAgra also contends that Fuller could not have been aware of the risk of\nlower BLLs, since no test for BLLs existed at the time, and could not have known of the\nspecific pathways by which children consume lead dust, which were not proved until much\nlater.\n         By 1914, as a major producer of lead paint since the previous century, Fuller was\nwell aware of the public health hazard posed to children by interior residential lead paint.\n\n                                                31\n\fThe 1910 congressional hearing and the 1914 published speech provide very strong\ncircumstantial evidence of Fuller’s actual knowledge. Fuller could not have failed to learn\nfrom the hearing and the article that deteriorated interior residential lead paint posed a “very\ndangerous” risk to the “health” of the inhabitants of those residences. Of course, this\nknowledge was reinforced by information that the LIA distributed to its members, including\nFuller, in the 1930s discussing how it was a “frequent occurrence” that children were\npoisoned by lead paint from “toys, cradles, and woodwork” and noting that even a small\n                                     29\namount of lead could kill a child.\n       In light of these facts, there is no merit to ConAgra’s claims that Fuller did not know\nchildren were consuming lead paint, that Fuller believed that such events were infrequent,\nand that Fuller could not have known that a small amount of lead could harm a child. Since\nFuller was aware that deteriorating interior residential lead paint exposed the occupants of\nthe residence to “very dangerous” lead dust, knowledge of the specific pathway by which\nchildren consume lead dust was not essential for Fuller to be aware that lead paint on\nresidential interiors posed a risk of serious harm to children.\n       ConAgra also claims that the evidence was insufficient to show Fuller’s knowledge\nbecause the trial court erroneously permitted plaintiff’s experts to opine about Fuller’s\n\n\n\n29\n       ConAgra contends that Fuller could not acquire knowledge through the LIA because\nthe LIA was not Fuller’s agent. It was Fuller’s own participation in the LIA that led it to\nacquire the requisite knowledge, not by means of any agency relationship between Fuller\nand the LIA.\n       ConAgra argues that the trial court could not reasonably rely on Fuller’s knowledge\nthrough the LIA because the court found that ARCO did not have knowledge through the\nLIA. The trial court’s finding as to ARCO did not expressly relate to the LIA. The court\nfound only that ARCO and its predecessors did not have knowledge of “adverse health\neffects from exposure to residential lead paint during the relevant time period.” Indeed, the\ncourt’s rejection of liability for ARCO was based primarily on a lack of evidence\nconnecting ARCO’s predecessors to the 10 jurisdictions. ConAgra makes no attempt to\ndemonstrate that the evidence of Fuller’s participation in the LIA was identical to that of\nARCO’s predecessors.\n                                               32\n\fknowledge. Since the material upon which the experts’ opinions were based provides\nsubstantial support for those opinions, the court did not err in admitting and relying on those\nopinions. We assess ConAgra’s claim that some of the documents relied on by the experts\nwere inadmissible hearsay in section IV(J)(1) of this opinion.\n       ConAgra asserts that Fuller was aware of the dangers of lead dust solely in the\noccupational context. As we have already explained, the evidence supports the trial court’s\nfinding that Fuller was aware of the risks posed by lead paint on residential interiors. We\nreject ConAgra’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s\nexpress finding that Fuller was aware of the public health hazard to children posed by lead\npaint in residential interiors.\n       NL claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court’s actual\nknowledge finding because plaintiff was required to prove that NL had “knowledge in the\nearly 1900s that children could get dangerous levels of blood lead from intact lead paint\nanywhere in any home . . . via invisible dust.” NL’s claim is misleading. Our review of the\ntrial court’s actual knowledge finding requires us to examine the record to determine\nwhether there is substantial evidence that NL knew in the early 1900s that interior\nresidential lead paint posed a significant risk of harm to children. We need not find\nevidence that NL understood precisely how children could be harmed by interior residential\nlead paint so long as there is substantial evidence that NL knew that interior residential lead\npaint posed a significant risk of harm to children.\n       Our examination of the record reveals that it contains substantial evidence that NL\nhad the requisite actual knowledge by 1914. The 1910 congressional hearing and the 1914\npublished speech were sufficient to make a leader in the lead paint industry aware of the\nrisk of serious harm that interior residential lead paint posed to children. NL claims that\nthere was not substantial evidence that it was aware in the early 20th century of the risks to\nchildren of “low-level” lead exposure. Since the information of which NL was aware\nsuggested that even adults were at serious risk from interior residential lead paint, NL could\n\n                                              33\n\fnot have failed to understand that the risk to children would be at least as great. NL, like\nFuller, subsequently gained further knowledge, from its participation in the LIA, that\nchildren who ingested even very small amounts of lead could suffer serious harm. The LIA\ninformed its members in the 1930s that even a small amount of lead could kill a child. And,\nat a 1937 LIA conference, a doctor informed LIA members that “[t]o get rid of the lead in\nchildren is almost impossible.”\n       We find substantial evidence in the record to support the trial court’s finding that NL\nhad actual knowledge of the risk of harm to children from interior residential lead paint.\n       SWC claims that the trial court’s finding that it had actual knowledge of the risk of\nharm to children from interior residential use of lead paint was based on “hindsight”\nbecause SWC could not have known “of today’s alleged risk to children from ultra-low\nBLLs that can come from ingesting lead in household dust.” SWC’s premise is flawed.\nThe trial court’s actual knowledge finding may be upheld if there is substantial evidence\nthat SWC was aware at the relevant time that interior residential lead paint posed a\nsignificant risk of harm to children. It was not necessary for there to be proof that SWC was\naware of the precise pathway by which children were exposed to lead and or that those\nharms could occur even at low BLL levels, particularly since there was no BLL test in\nexistence at the relevant time.\n       The evidence presented at trial established that SWC knew no later than 1900 that\nlead paint was prone to deterioration and that it posed a serious risk of harm to those\nexposed to it. SWC began making lead paint in 1880. By 1900, it knew that, because lead\nwas a “deadly cumulative poison,” and lead paint tended to deteriorate, lead paint could be\nseriously dangerous.\n       SWC claims that its knowledge in 1900 of risks from deteriorating lead paint was\nlimited to exterior use of lead paint, but the trial court could have reasonably concluded that\nSWC knew that the deterioration of interior residential lead paint would pose an even more\nserious risk that would be heightened with respect to young children who were necessarily\n\n                                              34\n\fconfined to the interiors of their homes. We conclude that substantial evidence supports the\ntrial court’s finding that SWC had actual knowledge of the serious risk of harm to children\nfrom interior residential lead paint.\n           3. Creating or Assisting in Creating a Public Nuisance: Promotion\n       Defendants challenge the trial court’s findings that they affirmatively promoted lead\npaint for interior residential use.\n       “ ‘[T]he critical question is whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation\nof the nuisance.’ ” (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at pp. 305-306.) “A public\nnuisance cause of action is not premised on a defect in a product or a failure to warn but on\naffirmative conduct that assisted in the creation of a hazardous condition. Here, the alleged\nbasis for defendants’ liability for the public nuisance created by lead paint is their\naffirmative promotion of lead paint for interior use, not their mere manufacture and\ndistribution of lead paint or their failure to warn of its hazards.” (Santa Clara I, at pp. 309-\n310, italics added.)\n       Defendants claim that the court could not base its promotion findings on their\n                                                       30\nadvertising without violating the First Amendment.          They also contend that reliance on the\n\n\n30\n        In a reply brief, defendants claim for the first time that we must apply a heightened\nstandard of substantial evidence review to the court’s promotion finding because “First\nAmendment rights are at stake.” Appellate courts ordinarily do not consider new issues\nraised for the first time in an appellant’s reply brief because such a tactic deprives the\nrespondent of the opportunity to respond to the contention. (Reichardt v. Hoffman (1997)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 764-765 (Reichardt).) It is only upon a showing of good cause for\nfailing to raise the issue earlier that an appellate court will address an issue that is initially\nraised in the reply brief. (Ibid.) We decline to address this issue as defendants have made\nno showing of good cause, and plaintiff has had no opportunity to address this issue.\n       Furthermore, the only case they cite in support of this claim is one in which the Court\nof Appeal acknowledged that a heightened standard of review is appropriate where the issue\nis whether a communication is unlawful. (San Francisco Unified School Dist. ex. rel.\nContreras v. First Student, Inc. (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1228.) In that case, the trial\ncourt had issued an injunction barring certain communications. (Id. at p. 1228.) Here, the\nonly plausible First Amendment issue is defendants’ contention that their “promotion” of\n                                                35\n\fpromotional advertising activities of the LIA and the NPVLA would violate their First\n                                            31\nAmendment right to free association.             In addition, the three defendants individually\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the court’s findings that each of them\naffirmatively promoted lead paint for interior residential use.\n       Defendants’ reliance on the First Amendment is misplaced. While “the creation and\ndissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment”\n(Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc.

Ohio State Bar\n\n\nlead paint for interior residential use was protected by the First Amendment. The trial\ncourt’s order did not bar any communications. In any case, since we conclude as a matter of\nlaw that their advertisements were not protected by the First Amendment, application of a\nheightened standard of review would not assist defendants.\n31\n       Defendants objected in the trial court on First Amendment grounds to evidence that\nthey had used commercial speech to promote lead paint for interior residential use. They\nalso objected on First Amendment freedom of association grounds to evidence based on\ntheir membership in the LIA and the NPVLA. The court overruled both objections.\n32\n       “If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the\ngovernment’s power is more circumscribed. . . . Compliance with this requirement may be\nmeasured by two criteria. First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest\ninvolved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote\nsupport for the government’s purpose. Second, if the governmental interest could be served\nas well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions\ncannot survive.” (Central Hudson, supra, 447 U.S. at p. 564.)\n                                                      36\n\fAss’n (1978) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109871\"><a href=\"/opinion/109871/ohralik-v-ohio-state-bar-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456.) The California Supreme Court has already acknowledged\nthat holding defendants liable in this case for the public nuisance created by their promotion\nof lead paint for interior residential use will not “prevent defendants from exercising any\nFirst Amendment right or any other liberty interest. Although liability may be based in part\non prior commercial speech, the remedy will not involve enjoining current or future\nspeech.” (Santa Clara II, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 55; see also People v.

Promotion of lead paint for interior residential use necessarily implied that lead\npaint was safe for such use. If defendants promoted lead paint for interior residential use\nwhile knowing that such use would create a public health hazard, then their promotions\nwere misleading and not entitled to any First Amendment protection. If, on the other hand,\ndefendants did not promote lead paint for interior residential use, or did not know at the\ntime they did so that such use would create a public health hazard, those promotions would\nnot establish that defendants created or assisted in the creation of a public nuisance. As any\nwrongful promotions would be misleading and not entitled to First Amendment protection,\nwe find no First Amendment bar to the trial court’s reliance on defendants’ promotions.\n       Defendants also make individual challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to\nsupport the trial court’s findings that each of them affirmatively promoted lead paint for\ninterior residential use while knowing of the public health hazard that such use would\ncreate. Our review of these contentions requires us to examine, among other things, the\nhundreds of advertisements upon which plaintiff relied to show that defendants had\npromoted lead paint for interior residential use. We must note at the outset that, for a\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\fnumber of reasons, a large number of these advertisements did not promote interior\nresidential use of lead paint.\n            Some of these advertisements expressly promoted only exterior use of lead paint.\nOthers promoted a particular brand without specifying any particular paint. Numerous\nadvertisements promoted lead paint as “house paint” without expressly promoting it for\ninterior use.\n            Another group of these advertisements promoted interior use of a particular paint\nwithout identifying that paint as a lead paint, and without other evidence that the particular\npaint promoted for interior use in these advertisements was a lead paint. Stipulations\nbetween plaintiff and NL and between plaintiff and SWC established that certain paints\npromoted by NL and SWC were lead paints, but there was no such stipulation with regard to\nFuller or as to paint companies acquired by NL or SWC. And many of the advertisements\nwere not specific enough to identify the promoted paint as one of those identified in the\nstipulations.\n            Many of the advertisements were not placed by NL, SWC, or Fuller, but instead by a\npaint store or a hardware retailer. While there was evidence that SWC financed half of the\ncost of its authorized dealers’ local advertisements and that NL “consistently supported\ndealers’ local advertising,” plaintiff’s expert acknowledged that there was no such evidence\nas to Fuller. As there was no evidence that Fuller had any involvement in the placement of\nadvertisements by hardware and paint stores, advertisements by those stores cannot be\nattributed to Fuller and cannot show that Fuller promoted lead paint for interior residential\n       33\nuse.\n\n\n\n33\n        For instance, a 1916 Santa Clara County “Farmers Union” advertisement promoted\nfor interior use a lead paint made by a company acquired by Fuller. A 1934 advertisement\nplaced by a Monterey hardware store promoted Fuller’s lead paint “for use on interior and\nexterior surfaces.” A 1940 Solano County hardware store advertisement promoted Fuller’s\nlead paint for “interior surfaces.” A 1942 Monterey County paint store advertisement\n                                                  38\n\f       Plaintiff also relied on the LIA’s two promotional campaigns. The member\ncompanies that participated in these campaigns funded them. Fuller was a member of the\nLIA from 1928 to 1958. SWC was a member of the LIA from 1928 to 1947. NL was an\nLIA member from 1928 to 1978. NL and Fuller participated in both of the LIA’s\ncampaigns; SWC participated in only the Forest Products campaign and contributed funds\nto that campaign only from 1937 to 1941.\n       Because the LIA’s promotional campaigns affected multiple defendants, we detail\nthose campaigns at the outset. The Forest Products campaign, which ran from 1934 to\n1941, was aimed at having manufacturers of lumber, window frames, and doors endorse\nlead paint. The purpose of the Forest Products campaign, which was active in California,\nwas to promote the use of lead paint on lumber and in residences. In 1934, the LIA\npersuaded lumber manufacturers associations on the West Coast to recommend the use of\nlead paint on lumber by “enclos[ing] ‘Painting Instructions’ folders with all bundles of\n                   34\nsiding” in 1935.        In 1938, the LIA persuaded the Western Pine Association to paint its\nmodel home at the San Francisco World’s Fair “inside and out with white lead and publicize\nthis specification.” Also in 1938, the LIA persuaded “sash [(window frame)] and door\nmanufacturers” to put labels on 20,000,000 sashes and doors “featuring the use of white\nlead and high-grade prepared paint.” In 1939, the LIA board was apprised that, due to the\nForest Products campaign, “ ‘[a]ll of the principal producers of soft and hard lumber in the\nUnited States such as redwood, cypresses, cedar, pine and others, now specify white lead or\nhigh grade prepared paint which contain white lead.’ ”\n\n\npromoted Fuller’s lead paint for interior use. A 1949 Vallejo paint store advertisement\npromoted Fuller’s lead paint as an “all-purpose house paint.”\n34\n        Plaintiff’s expert testified that these painting instructions included “methods for how\nto use paint on sidings and on floors and on objects in homes . . . .” (Italics added.) The\npainting instructions were not in evidence, and the expert relied solely on an LIA document\nthat referred only to “siding.” The expert also asserted that these instructions pertained to\n“siding interiors,” but he did not explain why the word “siding” would have been used in\nthe 1930s in reference to interior paneling.\n                                                 39\n\f       The LIA’s White Lead Promotion campaign, which ran in two phases, phase one\nfrom 1939 to 1944 and phase two from 1950 through 1952, was intended to increase the\n                         35\nmarket for white lead.        This campaign produced hundreds of advertisements promoting\nwhite lead. LIA advertisements in 1939 and 1940 expressly promoted lead paint for interior\nresidential use. A 1939 LIA advertisement in the Hardware Retailer reproduced a letter to\nthe LIA from the Douglas Fir Plywood Association touting lead paint for interior walls and\nceilings in addition to “exterior siding.” In 1940, LIA advertisements in “National Painters\nMagazine” and “American Painter and Decorator” promoted interior residential use of lead\npaint and proclaimed such things as “white lead lends itself ideally to any paint styling\ndesired by owner or architect, inside or out.” 1940 LIA advertisements in American Paint\nand Oil Dealer, American Painter and Decorator, National Painters Magazine, The Painter\nand Decorator, American Builder, Hardware Retailer, and Hardware Age all promoted lead\npaint for interior residential use.\n       By 1941, the LIA’s campaigns had created a great increase in the sale of lead paint\ncompared to non-lead paint. During the war, lead paint sales declined, and they continued\nto decline after the war. The LIA briefly revived the White Lead Promotion campaign in\nthe early 1950s, but it subsequently stopped specifically promoting white lead paint.\nAlthough the LIA’s campaigns did not reverse the long-term trend of less use of lead\npigments, these campaigns did prolong the use of lead pigments that otherwise probably\n                                  36\nwould have ceased to be used.          More white lead was used during the Depression (the late\n1920s and 1930s) than had been used previously, and the LIA attributed this increase to its\ncampaigns.\n\n\n\n\n35\n        Other LIA advertisements in 1939 and 1940 did not expressly promote lead paint for\ninterior use and mentioned only exterior use.\n36\n      It was unclear whether white lead sales would have declined more quickly if there\nhad been no White Lead Promotion campaign.\n                                                  40\n\f       With this background in mind, we proceed to review defendants’ individual\ncontentions.\n                                            a. ConAgra\n       ConAgra contends that there is not substantial evidence that Fuller promoted lead\npaint for residential interiors with the requisite knowledge because (1) Fuller’s post-1929\nadvertisements did not tell consumers to use lead paint on residential interiors, (2) Fuller’s\npost-1935 advertisements did not mention lead or were only for exterior paint, (3) Fuller did\nnot sell any lead paint for interiors after 1948, and (4) Fuller did not participate in the LIA’s\npromotions.\n       Evidence at trial established that Fuller sold lead paint in the 10 jurisdictions from\n1894 to 1961. Between 1894 and 1948, Fuller marketed two lead products: Pure Prepared\n                                       37\nPaint and Pioneer White Lead in Oil.        Fuller also marketed paints and other coatings that\ndid not contain lead. Fuller’s lead paints were sold at its own stores and by independent\ndealers in all 10 jurisdictions between 1894 and 1961. Plaintiff’s experts testified that\nFuller promoted the use of white lead by distributing brochures for consumers and painters\nthat instructed them to use Fuller’s lead paints for residential interiors and exteriors. They\nalso asserted that Fuller’s advertisements in the 10 jurisdictions instructed consumers to use\nFuller’s white lead paints on their residences.\n       A large number of the advertisements for Fuller products in the record are not for\n                                                               38\nFuller’s lead paint but for other Fuller paints or coatings.        Another group of these\nadvertisements simply generally advertised Fuller paints with no specification of which\nones or without specifying for what purposes, or with specifications of the purposes for each\n\n\n\n37\n       Fuller also owned the Phoenix and Nason paint companies and marketed Phoenix’s\nlead paint.\n38\n       The record contains hundreds of advertisements for Fuller products. Fuller\nadvertised its “Nitrokote,” “Fullerglo,” “Enamel,” and other specific paints, and there was\nno evidence that these paints contained lead.\n                                                 41\n\fpaint that did not suggest that Fuller’s lead paint be used for interiors. Plaintiff’s expert\ntestified: “In my expert opinion, they all are advertising Fuller Paints which contain lead.\nAnd they are actually ads that are informing consumers to use Fuller products without any\nacknowledgment they are containing lead. Some of them have lead in it, some don’t.”\nSince plaintiff’s expert acknowledged that Fuller made both lead paint and non-lead paint,\nthe mere fact that Fuller advertised its products does not establish that it promoted its lead\npaint for interior residential use. We disregard plaintiff’s expert’s testimony on this point\nbecause it lacks any rational basis in the evidence.\n       Many advertisements in the record were for Fuller’s lead paint but did not expressly\nsuggest that it be used for interiors. Some of these advertisements described Fuller’s lead\npaint as “house paint.” However, another group of Fuller advertisements explicitly\npromoted Fuller’s lead paints for “all” residential purposes. For example, a 1927 Monterey\nFuller advertisement promoted Fuller’s lead paint “for all general purposes.” Fuller\nadvertisements in 1937 in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Los Angeles Times\ndescribed Fuller’s lead paint as “all purpose, ‘house’ paint.” While these advertisements\nsuggested that Fuller’s lead paint could be used for any purpose, including interior\nresidential use, the most important evidence of Fuller’s promotion of its lead paint for\ninterior residential use was Fuller’s 1931 brochure for its lead paint. This brochure’s\n“Directions for Use” instructed consumers to use this lead paint for residential interiors.\nSince Fuller’s advertisements frequently suggested that consumers obtain brochures from a\nFuller dealer, the brochure’s “Directions for Use” amounted to instructions to all of those\nwho purchased Fuller’s lead paint to use it for residential interiors. Fuller also participated\nin both of the LIA’s promotional campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s, which promoted lead\npaint for interior residential use.\n       This evidence rebuts ConAgra’s contentions. Fuller did promote its lead paint after\n1929 and after 1935, both by instructing consumers to use its lead paint for interior\nresidential use and by participating in the LIA’s campaigns promoting lead paint for interior\n\n                                               42\n\fresidential use. It is immaterial whether Fuller’s advertisements mentioned the word “lead”\nso long as the paint promoted in the advertisement was a lead paint, as it was. Fuller’s\nclaim that it ceased to produce and sell lead paint in 1948 is immaterial even if true. It was\nnot necessary to show that Fuller continued to assist in the creation of the public nuisance\nthroughout the entire period if its conduct constituted a substantial factor in causing the\npublic nuisance (an issue we address in section IV(A)(4) of this opinion). Fuller’s claim\nthat it did not participate in the LIA’s promotions was rebutted by substantial evidence at\ntrial.\n         We conclude that there is substantial evidence that Fuller itself promoted its lead\npaint for interior residential use at least beginning in 1931 and that it continued to do so as\npart of the LIA’s promotional campaigns in the 1930s and 1940s. Since the evidence\nsupports the trial court’s finding that Fuller knew of the danger that such use would create\nfor children at that time, there is substantial evidence that Fuller promoted lead paint for\ninterior residential use with the requisite knowledge.\n                                             b. NL\n         NL contends that its advertisements were not misleading because they merely\ndescribed how well lead paint would protect and beautify interior walls and woodwork. As\nwe have already explained, promotion of lead paint for interior residential use was\ninherently misleading because it implicitly asserted that it was safe for such use when it was\nnot. NL also asserts that the court’s promotion finding cannot be upheld because there was\nno evidence that NL promoted lead paint for interior residential use after 1950. As we have\nnoted above, the period during which a defendant assisted in the creation of a public\nnuisance is relevant only as to causation; it does not rebut a showing of affirmative\npromotion with the requisite knowledge.\n         Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that NL affirmatively promoted\nlead paint for interior residential use with the requisite knowledge. NL stipulated that it\nmanufactured, sold, and promoted lead paint for residential use in the 10 jurisdictions from\n\n                                                43\n\f1900 to 1972 and that its “White Lead-in-Oil,” “Dutch Boy House Paint 104,” “Dutch Boy\nHouse Paint 111,” and “Dutch Boy House Paint 116” contained white lead. No evidence\n                                                                               39\nwas produced at trial that any other NL paint products contained white lead.\n       Plaintiff’s expert testified that NL promoted its Dutch Boy lead paint for interior\nresidential use. NL produced “little illustrated books [in which] children were provided\nwith both a story and a coloring pallet of paint that basically depicted the ways in which\nDutch Boy white lead paint protected children from all sorts of onslaughts.” He testified\nthat NL “[s]pecifically promoted the use” of lead paint in “play rooms, . . . homes and on to\nsurfaces and even on their furniture.” Plaintiff’s expert also noted that NL’s advertisements\ndid not necessarily disclose whether NL’s lead paint contained lead and did not always\ndistinguish between the use of lead paint on interiors and its use on exteriors. As we will\nexplain, the material upon which plaintiff’s expert based his testimony provides substantial\nsupport for his testimony.\n       NL’s advertisements from the early 20th century demonstrate that NL repeatedly\npromoted its lead paint for interior residential use. A 1915 NL advertisement in the San\nFrancisco Chronicle did so. A 1924 NL advertisement in National Geographic Magazine\ndid so. A 1929 NL advertisement in the Los Angeles Times did so. 1929 NL\nadvertisements in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Oakland Tribune promoted lead\n\n\n39\n        Many of the advertisements in the record were for Bass-Hueter products. NL\npurchased Bass-Hueter Paint Company in 1916, and Bass-Hueter merged with NL in 1930.\nNo evidence was produced at trial that any specific Bass-Hueter paints contained white\nlead. Although the record contains 1931 advertisements for Bass-Hueter paints that\npromoted interior residential use, there is no evidence that those paints were lead paints. A\n1933 Santa Clara County hardware store advertisement promoted Bass-Heuter Pure Lead\nand Oil Paint, but it did not suggest that it be used for residential interiors. Although Bass-\nHeuter advertisements in 1922 in Solano County and in 1925 in Santa Clara County\ndescribed Bass-Heuter paints as having “permanent pigments, a base consisting of a\ncombination of pure carbonate of lead and oxide of zinc, ground in refined linseed oil,”\nthere is no indication that these advertisements were admitted or could properly be admitted\nfor their truth. Accordingly, the Bass-Hueter advertisements do not establish that NL\npromoted lead paint for interior residential use.\n                                              44\n\fpaint for “your stucco house or for any other surface.” (Italics added.) A 1938 San Diego\nadvertisement by a paint store promoted Dutch Boy, NL’s brand, as “All Purpose Lead.” A\n1950 San Diego advertisement by a paint store promoted NL’s lead products for interior\nresidential use. And NL participated in both of the LIA’s promotional campaigns in the\n1930s and 1940s promoting lead paint for interior residential use.\n       NL’s 1929 “paint book” for children showed a “Dutch Boy Painter” who tells the\nchildren, “This famous Dutch Boy Lead of mine [¶] Can make this playroom fairly shine\n[¶] Let’s start our painting right away [¶] You’ll find the work is only play.” The book\nshowed children stirring and painting with clearly labeled containers of Dutch Boy White\nLead paint and then playing in their newly painted playroom. At the end of the book, it\nsaid: “For durable economical paint—inside or outside [¶] Paint with lead [¶] Dutch Boy\nWhite-Lead.” Every page of the “paint book” instructed children to give their parents the\n                                      40\n“coupon” in the middle of the book.        NL’s paint book contained “paper chips of paint” for\nchildren to use to color the pictures in the book. NL used this paint book as a promotion\n“for many years.” This paint book obviously promoted lead paint for interior residential\nuse.\n       NL’s 1949 salesman’s manual instructed NL’s salesmen that NL’s lead paints could\n“handle any painting job, exterior or interior” on any building. The manual told the\nsalesmen that NL’s “Lead Mixing Oil” was appropriate for “interior surfaces.”\n       NL’s 1950 “Handbook on Painting” encouraged the use of white lead paint on\ninterior surfaces: “On interiors white lead is desired for its unique richness and solid beauty\nof finish. Also, the durability of white lead paint enables it to stand up under frequent\nwashing—a big money saver in such places as hospitals and hotels.” “The customary flat\npaint for interior work is made by mixing white lead with either Lead Mixing Oil or flatting\n\n\n\n40\n      In NL’s 1949 salesman’s manual, NL noted that the “paint book” was one of its\n“most successful promotions” of its paint.\n                                                45\n\foil.” “Dutch Boy Lead Mixing Oil, when mixed with white lead in the proper proportions,\nmakes flat paint that can be used on exterior as well as interior surfaces.” “Furthermore,\nwhite lead and Lead Mixing Oil has the sturdy wear and beauty of finish characteristic of all\nwhite lead paint, whether exposed to weather or used inside. [¶] White lead and Lead\nMixing Oil can be used for all coats on plaster and wallboard.” NL’s instructions for use in\nthis handbook explicitly advocated the use of lead paint on interiors.\n       Substantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that NL affirmatively promoted\nlead paint for interior residential use with the requisite knowledge. NL extensively\npromoted its lead paint for interior residential use from 1915 through 1950. Because NL\nknew of the danger to children from lead paint on residential interiors no later than 1914,\nsubstantial evidence supports the trial court’s finding that NL’s subsequent promotions of\nlead paint for such use were done with the requisite knowledge.\n                                           c. SWC\n       SWC contends that plaintiff did not present evidence of any advertisement by SWC\npromoting lead paint for interior residential use.\n       SWC stipulated that it began manufacturing lead paint in 1880 and began\nmanufacturing white lead carbonate pigment in 1910. SWC manufactured Old Dutch\nProcess (ODP) white lead in oil from 1910 to 1947. SWC manufactured “Inside Floor\nPaint,” some colors of which contained white lead, between 1910 and 1913. SWC’s other\nwhite lead paints were some of its SWP “house paint” colors until 1950, some of its\n                                    41\n“Family Paint” colors in the 1940s, its “Porch and Deck” paint, and its “Concrete &\n\n\n\n41\n       SWC and plaintiff stipulated that there was “no evidence” that SWC’s “Family\nPaint,” a paint that was intended for and promoted for interior residential use, “ever\ncontained white lead sulfate” or “ever contained white lead carbonate pigment prior to\n1941.” Interestingly, SWC’s 1926 training manual for its representatives stated that Family\nPaint, which it stated “will give good service on inside work,” contained “White Lead\nSulfate” pigment. SWC and plaintiff also stipulated that they had discovered no post-1936\nadvertisements for SWC’s Family Paint.\n                                              46\n\f                 42\nStucco” paint.        SWC also sold Monarch House Paint, ACME Quality House Paint, and\nLowe Brothers High Standard House Paint, which were all lead paints. In a 1934\npromotional booklet, SWC proclaimed that it was the “world’s largest paint producer” and\n“one of the country’s largest producers of White Lead.”\n       SWC promoted and sold its white lead products for residential use in the 10\njurisdictions. The primary message conveyed in advertisements for SWC’s paints, Monarch\npaints, and ACME’s paints was that there was a specific coating for each purpose and that it\nwas important to get the right coating for each type of use. For example, a 1903 SWC\nadvertisement read: “No matter what you want to paint, . . . you’ll get best results and save\nmoney if you use [¶] THE SHERWIN-WILLIAMS PAINTS [¶] A special paint for each\npurpose.” A large group of SWC advertisements simply generically advertised SWC’s\nbrand, without specifying any particular paints. Many SWC advertisements were for\nSWC’s non-lead “Kemtone” paint.\n       Advertisements for SWC’s SWP House Paint often specified that it was for exterior\nuse. Others simply referred to SWP as “house paint” without mentioning interior use. Still\nothers identified SWP as being for “wood surfaces” or for all “woodwork” surfaces.\nHowever, there were also advertisements promoting SWP for interior residential use. 1904\nSWC advertisements in the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union promoted SWP\n\n\n\n\n       In view of the parties’ stipulations, we are required to disregard evidence that SWC’s\nFamily Paint was promoted for interior residential use prior to 1941. 1901 and 1904\nadvertisements in the Los Angeles Times promoted SWC Family Paint for interior use. A\n1923 SWC advertisement in the San Francisco Examiner promoted SWC’s Family Paint as\n“an all-round paint for inside use.” A 1926 advertisement in the Oakland Tribune promoted\nSWC Family Paint as a “household paint.”\n42\n       For instance, SWC’s SWP Mildew Resisting White paint contained lead prior to\n1954. Some of the colors in SWC’s SWP Colors contained lead until 1950. In 1938, SWC\nalso sold a lead paint called Zilo.\n                                               47\n\f                    43\nfor “inside” use.        In addition, SWC participated in the LIA’s Forest Products campaign\nfrom 1937 to 1941, which promoted lead paint for interior residential use and particularly\nfor use on doors and window frames.\n       SWC had the requisite knowledge in 1900 of the public health hazard posed by lead\npaint, but it nevertheless continued to promote lead paint for interior residential use\nthereafter. This evidence supports the trial court’s finding that SWC engaged in the\nrequisite wrongful promotion.\n                                            4. Causation\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff did not produce substantial evidence that their\npromotions of lead paint for interior residential use were a substantial factor in causing the\nnuisance that the trial court required them to abate. First, they contend that there was no\nevidence that their promotions actually had an impact on the use of lead paint on residential\ninteriors. Second, they contend that their wrongful promotions were too remote from the\ncurrent presence of any public health hazard created by interior residential lead paint,\nwhich, they claim, is largely due to owner neglect, renovations, intervening actors\n(architects, painters, etc.), and repainting that has taken place in the interim. Third, they\nargue that, because they did not promote lead paint for interior residential use after 1950,\nthey could not be held responsible for use of lead paint on residential interiors of homes\nbuilt after 1950. The trial court’s judgment required defendants to remediate interior lead\npaint in all homes built before 1980, even though most of those homes were built after\n1950. Fourth, they maintain that there was no evidence that their promotions of lead paint\n\n\n\n43\n        Although many of the advertisements for SWC paints were placed by hardware\nstores or other retailers, SWC paid half of the cost of advertising by its authorized dealers,\nso these advertisements may properly be attributed to SWC. A 1924 lumber store\nadvertisement in Monterey for Monarch lead paint suggested that it could be used for\ninteriors. However, the stipulation between SWC and plaintiff was that this paint contained\nlead between 1925 and 1930, which does not include 1924 when this advertisement was\nplaced.\n                                                 48\n\ffor interior residential use had a causal connection to the water leaks and soil lead that the\ncourt ordered them to remediate. Fifth, defendants claim that plaintiff was required to show\nthat their individual lead paints are currently present in a large number of homes in the 10\njurisdictions. Sixth, they argue that due process requires that their liability for remediation\nbe proportionate to their individual contributions.\n       Causation is an element of a cause of action for public nuisance.

Impact and Remoteness\n       In this case, there was plenty of evidence that defendants’ affirmative promotions of\nlead paint for interior residential use played at least a “minor” role in creating the nuisance\nthat now exists.\n       First, all three defendants participated in the LIA’s Forest Products campaign. The\nForest Products campaign began in 1934. In 1935, the LIA reported that its Forest Products\ncampaign had resulted in some manufacturers of leadless paints “changing their formulas to\ninclude lead.” In 1939, the LIA reported to its members that, as a result of the Forest\nProducts campaign, (1) “[a]ll the principal producers of soft and hard lumber in the United\nStates . . . specify white lead or high grade prepared paint which contains white lead”\n\n                                               49\n\fthrough the “distributi[on of] painting instruction leaflets (2,000,000 copies)”; (2) “[s]ome\npaint companies have increased the lead content of their paint”; and (3) “sash and door\nmanufacturers” would be producing “20,000,000 labels to be affixed to nearly all the sash\nand doors in the United States, featuring the use of white lead and high-grade prepared\npaint.” In 1941, the LIA reported that the benefits of the Forest Products campaign were\ncontinuing. “Lumber associations continued distributing, at their own expense, thousands\nof painting leaflets recommending white lead or the highest grade prepared paints to be used\non their products” and that the “National Door Manufacturing Association” was “the latest\nto use painting leaflets” to promote the use of white lead. The lumber manufacturers were\ncontinuing to include “painting instruction leaflets” with their lumber products. Since lead\npaint on doors and windows is one of the most hazardous uses for children due to the dust\ncreated by their friction surfaces, this campaign played a significant role in creating the\nnuisance that now exists.\n       Second, both NL and Fuller gave consumers of their lead paints explicit instructions\nto use those paints on residential interiors. Fuller’s 1931 brochure for its lead paint\ncontained “Directions for Use” instructing consumers to use this lead paint for residential\ninteriors. Since Fuller’s advertisements frequently suggested that consumers obtain\nbrochures from a Fuller dealer, the brochure’s “Directions for Use” constituted instructions\nto all those who purchased Fuller’s lead paint to use it for residential interiors. NL\nproduced its 1929 paint book, which promoted lead paint for interior residential use, and NL\npublished its 1950 “Handbook on Painting,” which explicitly recommended that consumers\nuse white lead paint on interior surfaces.\n       In sum, by persuading window and door manufacturers to attach written\nrecommendations to all windows and doors that lead paint should be used on those windows\nand doors, all three defendants certainly played a significant role in causing lead paint to be\nused on at least some of those windows and doors. Further, NL and Fuller, by explicitly\ninstructing consumers to use their lead paints on residential interiors, played an even more\n\n                                               50\n\fdirect role in causing lead paint to be used in such a manner. Again, the trial court could\nreasonably infer that at least some of those who were the targets of these recommendations\nheeded them. That is all that the substantial factor test requires.\n        We cannot credit defendants’ claim that there was no evidence that their promotions\nwere even “a very minor force”—“a substantial factor”—in causing the presence of lead\npaint on residential interiors in the 10 jurisdictions. The LIA’s extensive advertising\ncampaigns, in which all three defendants participated, affirmatively promoted to painters,\narchitects, retailers, and consumers the use of lead paint on residential interiors, and each\ndefendant also individually promoted to consumers lead paint for use on residential interiors\nin the 10 jurisdictions. The LIA judged its promotional campaigns to be a success, and the\nfact that lead paint remains in place on residential interiors in many homes throughout the\n10 jurisdictions decades after all of these promotions ceased reflects that this belief was\naccurate. We find reasonable the inference that each individual defendant’s promotion of\nlead paint for interior residential use, both through the LIA promotional campaigns and their\nindividual promotions, were at least “a very minor force” in leading to the current presence\nof interior residential lead paint in a substantial number of homes in the 10 jurisdictions.\n        Defendants also contend that their wrongful promotions were too remote from the\ncurrent hazard to be its “legal cause.” They claim that, due to the lapse of time, this hazard\nis more closely attributable to owner neglect, renovations, painters, architects, and\nrepainting. “A tort is a legal cause of injury only when it is a substantial factor in producing\nthe injury.” (Soule v.

This was a question of fact for the trial court. A rational factfinder could have\nconcluded that defendants’ wrongful promotions of lead paint for interior residential use\nwere not unduly remote from the presence of interior residential lead paint placed on those\nresidences during the period of defendants’ wrongful promotions and within a reasonable\nperiod thereafter.

City of Chicago v. American Cyanamid Co. (Ill.

Those who were influenced by the\npromotions to use lead paint on residential interiors in the 10 jurisdictions were the single\nconduit between defendants’ actions and the current hazard. Under these circumstances, the\ntrial court could have reasonably concluded that defendants’ promotions, which were a\nsubstantial factor in creating the current hazard, were not too remote to be considered a\nlegal cause of the current hazard even if the actions of others in response to those\npromotions and the passive neglect of owners also played a causal role. The court could\ntherefore have concluded that defendants’ promotions were the “legal cause” of the current\nnuisance.\n                                     b. Post-1950 Homes\n       We find merit in defendants’ claim that the record lacks substantial evidence to\nsupport the court’s finding that their wrongful promotions were causally connected to post-\n1950 homes containing interior lead paint built before 1980.\n       Plaintiff claims that defendants’ wrongful promotions “sustained, increased, and\nprolonged the use of lead paint in homes throughout the 20th century.” (Italics added.) It\nasserts that this can be “inferred” from the “sheer breadth of Defendants’ promotional\nactivities” and the fact that there is currently lead paint in homes in the 10 jurisdictions.\nPlaintiff also claims that NL continued to promote lead paint for interior residential use\nbeyond 1950.\n       First of all, plaintiff did not produce any evidence of an affirmative promotion by\nNL, SWC, or Fuller of lead paint for interior residential use after 1950. The advertisements\nthat plaintiff identifies as post-1950 NL promotions did not promote lead paint for interior\nresidential use. Those advertisements promoted NL’s “Dutch Boy” brand of paints and\nidentified interior residential use as one of the uses for NL’s “Dutch Boy” brand of paints\nwithout suggesting that any lead paint be used for interiors. NL stipulated at trial that its\n“White Lead-in-Oil” and three of its “Dutch Boy” paints contained white lead, and plaintiff\npresented no evidence that any other NL paint product contained lead. Since NL\n\n                                               53\n\findisputably made many Dutch Boy paints, NL’s promotion of its brand for many uses,\nincluding interior residential use, did not amount to an affirmative promotion of lead paint\nfor interior residential use. Indeed, plaintiff’s argument seems to be based on the idea that\nthe mere fact that these advertisements identified National Lead Company as the maker of\nDutch Boy paints transformed advertisements for non-lead paints for interior use into\npromotions of lead paint for interior use. We reject this unfounded argument.\n       NL contends that the evidence could not support a finding that it caused the use of\nlead paint on residential interiors after 1955 because, according to NL, all lead paint bore a\nlabel marking it as not for interior residential use beginning in 1955. The only citation to\nthe record that NL provides is to testimony by a defense expert about a standard created by\nthe American Standards Association in 1955. The expert testified that the LIA had\nparticipated in the creation of that standard. He referenced a defense exhibit, a barely\nlegible copy of which appears in the record, that apparently contains the 1955 standard.\nThis standard states: “These specifications cover the requirements for coatings (such as\npaints, enamels, lacquers, etc. applied in liquid form) which are deemed suitable from a\nhealth standpoint to be used to paint children’s toys or furniture or interior surfaces so that\nthe danger of poisoning will be minimized if, by chance, some of this coating should be\nchewed off and swallowed by a child.” “A liquid coating material to be deemed suitable,\nfrom a health standpoint, for use on articles such as furniture, toys, etc, or for interior use in\ndwelling units where it might be chewed by children” should not contain more than\n1 percent lead. The standard states that coatings complying with it “may be marked:\n‘Conforms to American Standard Z66.1-1955, for use on surfaces that might be chewed by\nchildren.” Notably, this standard does not impose any labeling requirement of any kind on\nlead paint.\n       Although one might draw an inference that the LIA’s participation in the creation of\nthis standard encouraged the compliance of its members, the trial court was not required to\ndraw that inference. Indeed, the standard itself stated: “The existence of an American\n\n                                                54\n\fStandard does not in any respect preclude any party who has approved of the standard from\nmanufacturing, selling, or using products . . . not conforming to the standard.” Moreover,\nthis standard did not even suggest a label for lead paint. It pertained to a label for non-lead\npaints. Nor is there any affirmative evidence in the record that even this standard was\nenforced by anyone or that any defendant complied with it beginning in 1955.\n       Nevertheless, plaintiff’s assertion that the current presence of lead paint on\nresidential interiors itself establishes that defendants’ pre-1951 promotions caused it to be\nplaced there is speculative and attempts to eliminate the causation element entirely. While\nwe can accept the inference that defendants’ pre-1951 promotions increased the use of lead\npaint on residential interiors during the period of those promotions, we reject plaintiff’s\nclaim that it is a reasonable inference that the impact of those promotions may be assumed\nto have continued for the next 30 years. We can find no evidence in the record that supports\nan inference that the promotions of defendants prior to 1951 continued to cause the use of\n                                                     45\nlead paint on residential interiors decades later.        We therefore conclude that we cannot\nuphold the trial court’s judgment requiring defendants to remediate all houses built before\n                                                                                              46\n1981 because there is no evidence to support causation as to the homes built after 1950.\n                                c. Water Leaks and Soil Lead\n       Defendants also challenge on causation grounds the court’s inclusion of soil lead and\nwater leaks in its remediation plan.\n\n\n45\n       ConAgra contends that the court erred in treating homes built before 1981 as an\n“indivisible group.” We do not believe that the court treated these homes as an indivisible\ngroup. The court’s remediation plan explicitly assigned homes built before 1950 to the\nhighest priority, while homes built from 1950 to 1981 were assigned a lower priority. Since\nthe age of a home is generally discoverable, homes may be readily distinguished from one\nanother based on the date they were built. Indeed, by limiting the remediation plan to\nhomes built before 1981, the court’s remediation plan already treated homes differently\nbased on their age.\n46\n      On remand, the trial court will need to recalculate the amount of the abatement fund\naccordingly.\n                                               55\n\f       This was a disputed issue at trial. Plaintiff’s experts testified: “[L]ead paint gets into\nthe soil from several routes. One is by the friction and impact surfaces, opening and closing\nwindows and doors on a home with lead-based paint. It also results from the weathering of\npaint exterior on the home, rain and sun hits the paint, it deteriorates over time. And also\nprevious paint jobs, generally where they are sanding and scraping have contributed to soil\nlead contamination around the home.” Lead concentrations are highest close to the home\n“[b]ecause we know that the exterior is subject to weathering, because windows on the\nexterior often have high lead concentrations and they are subject to friction and impact, and\nbecause the previous painting jobs could have caused sanding and scraping on the exterior\n                                                                                          47\nof a home which often then resides as contamination of the soil close to the home.”\n“[L]ead-based paint in housing now is the major source of contamination of both soil and\n               48\nhouse dust.”        Thus, plaintiff’s evidence established that a prime contributor to soil lead\nwas lead paint on the friction surfaces of windows and doors, which are interior, rather than\nexterior surfaces. In keeping with this evidence, the judgment requires remediation of soil\nlead only where the home itself contains interior lead paint. Under these circumstances, the\nevidence supports the court’s implied finding that soil lead in those homes has been caused\nby interior residential use of lead paint.\n       The court’s decision to include remediation of water leaks in the judgment is not a\ncausation issue. Plaintiff did not contend that the water leaks should be remediated because\nthey were caused by defendants’ promotions. The reason why remediation of water leaks is\n\n\n\n47\n        One of plaintiff’s experts responded to the question “What are sources of lead in dust\nin [sic] soil, other than -- your view is that the sources for dust and soil lead are lead-based\npaint; right?” by saying “Sure. Where leaded paints are available. I mean in the housing\nunit.” This response does not necessarily attribute soil lead to interior lead paint as the\nquestion referred to both soil lead and household dust lead.\n48\n       He also testified that “lead in housing” consisted of “lead paint, lead dust in housing,\nand lead in soil.” Plaintiff’s expert testified that soil lead and dust lead inside houses are\nlinked because “the soil is often tracked into the home on people’s shoes.”\n                                                  56\n\fproperly part of the remediation plan is that the court did not order remediation of all\ninterior lead paint. As water leaks could cause intact interior lead paint to deteriorate and\npresent a dangerous hazard to children, the remediation of water leaks was an appropriate\nlesser alternative to removal of all interior lead paint. Since defendants’ wrongful\npromotions caused the presence of interior lead paint, the court did not err in requiring\nremediation designed to prevent that interior lead paint from harming children in those\nhomes.\n                            d. Identification of Individual Paint\n       Defendants contend that their promotions cannot be found to have caused the\npresence of interior lead paint in homes in the 10 jurisdictions without proof that paint made\nby each of them is currently present in those homes. This contention misconstrues the basis\nfor defendants’ liability. Defendants are liable for promoting lead paint for interior\nresidential use. To the extent that this promotion caused lead paint to be used on residential\ninteriors, the identity of the manufacturer of that lead paint is irrelevant. Indeed, the LIA’s\npromotions did not refer to any manufacturer of lead paint, but were generic. What matters\nis whether defendants’ promotions were a substantial factor in leading to the use of lead\npaint on residential interiors. Substantial evidence supports the court’s causation finding on\nthat basis.\n                                  e. Proportioned Liability\n       Defendants’ final challenge to the court’s causation finding is based on their claim\nthat they could not be held liable except in proportion to their individual contributions to the\ncreation of the public nuisance. They claim that due process precluded the imposition of a\nremedy that was “grossly disproportionate to a defendant’s conduct.”\n       None of the cases they cite concerns causation in a public nuisance case.\nProportionality is not a causation issue. Defendants may be held liable for a public nuisance\nthat they assisted in creating if their wrongful promotions were a substantial factor in the\ncreation of that public nuisance. As we have already concluded, the evidence supports the\n\n                                               57\n\ftrial court’s finding at least as to homes built before 1951. Proportionate liability is\nsomething that defendants may be able to determine by means of litigation between\nthemselves, but the fact that the remediation plan does not apportion liability among\ndefendants does not infect the court’s causation finding.\n       Citing the Restatement, defendants argue that “a defendant can be liable only for its\nown contribution to a nuisance.” However, the Restatement comment upon which they rely\ndoes not support their contention. It says: “[T]he burden rests upon the defendant to\nproduce sufficient evidence to permit the apportionment to be made. [¶] When the\napportionment is made, each person contributing to the nuisance is subject to liability only\nfor his own contribution. He is not liable for that of others; but the fact that the others are\ncontributing is not a defense to his own liability.” (Rest.2d Torts, § 840E, com. B, italics\nadded.) The trial court could have reasonably concluded that defendants did not prove that\nthe harm was capable of apportionment. The Restatement confirms that where the harm is\nnot capable of apportionment, each contributor is liable for the entire harm. (Rest.2d Torts,\n§ 840E, com. c.) In this case, it is clear that the trial court properly concluded that the harm\nwas incapable of apportionment and therefore held all three defendants jointly and severally\nliable for the entire harm.\n                5. Abatability, Imminent Danger, and Reduction of BLLs\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to prove that defendants have the ability to\nabate lead in private homes or that abatement can be achieved “at a reasonable cost by\nreasonable means.”\n       This court rejected defendants’ “ability to abate” contention in Santa Clara I.\n“ ‘[L]iability for nuisance does not hinge on whether the defendant owns, possesses or\ncontrols the property, nor on whether he is in a position to abate the nuisance; the critical\n\n\n\n\n                                               58\n\fquestion is whether the defendant created or assisted in the creation of the nuisance.’ ”\n                                                                                               49\n(Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 306.)

The issue in Mangini II concerned the statute of\nlimitations. (Mangini II, at p. 1090.) Because the plaintiffs had not filed their private\nnuisance action within the three-year limitations period for a “permanent” nuisance, the\naction was barred unless the nuisance was a “continuing” one. (Ibid.) “ ‘[T]he crucial test\nof the permanency of a trespass or nuisance is whether the trespass or nuisance can be\ndiscontinued or abated.’ ” (Mangini II, at p. 1097.) The California Supreme Court held that\nthe plaintiffs had failed to prove that the nuisance was abatable. However, the court\nexpressly denied that its holding would be applicable where the statute of limitations was\nnot at issue: “We express no opinion on the question whether a plaintiff who has filed a\ntimely nuisance action is required to prove that abatement can be accomplished at a\n‘reasonable cost’ in order to be entitled to an injunction requiring the wrongdoing party to\nremedy the damage to the property.” (Mangini II, at p. 1090.)

The plaintiff in Helix attempted to allege inverse condemnation and\nnuisance causes of action based on its claim that its land was at greater risk of harm due to\nthe City’s actions and inactions regarding flood control. (Helix, at pp. 940, 950.) However,\nthe plaintiff failed to allege that the City’s actions “present[] a future hazard” to its land.\n(Helix, at p. 950.) The plaintiff did not allege that any damage had occurred, and the court\nfound that it was mere speculation that damage might occur in the future. (Ibid.) The court\nrejected the plaintiff’s nuisance cause of action on the ground that it had failed to allege that\na “prospective nuisance” was “either probable or imminent.” (Helix, at p. 951.)\n       Helix does not support defendants’ challenge to the trial court’s abatement order. In\nthis case, unlike in Helix, there was substantial evidence that interior residential lead paint\n                                                                                          51\nhad been causing and will continue to cause harm to children in the 10 jurisdictions.\n“Almost all human activity involves some risk, and in circumstances in which Civil Code\nsection 3479 is the only applicable statute, considerable judicial discretion has been allowed\nin determining whether an alleged danger is sufficiently serious to justify abatement.” (City\n\n\n\n51\n       They also cite Beck, but in Beck, unlike this case, there was “no evidence” of\npotential harm from the alleged public nuisance.

Every year, numerous children in\nthe 10 jurisdictions are found to be suffering from lead poisoning due to their exposure to\nlead paint. “[T]he lead will not disappear on its own.” So long as interior residential lead\npaint continues to exist in the 10 jurisdictions, this nuisance will continue to be an ongoing\nand imminent risk to the health of the children in the 10 jurisdictions. The trial court did not\nabuse its discretion in determining that the danger posed by interior residential lead paint in\nthe 10 jurisdictions poses a sufficiently serious and imminent risk of harm to merit\nabatement.\n       Defendants also contend that abatement is unwarranted because plaintiff failed to\nshow that abatement will reduce the BLLs of children in the 10 jurisdictions. Plaintiff\npresented expert testimony that abatement is effective at reducing BLLs in children.\nDefendants concede that plaintiff presented such evidence, but they maintain that this expert\n                                                   52\nopinion testimony was “inadmissible guesswork.”         The trial court admitted this evidence,\nand defendants make no effort to demonstrate that the court abused its broad discretion in\ndoing so. Their citation to Sargon Enterprises, Inc. v. University of Southern California\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Sargon) is not helpful to their contention. Sargon held that the trial\ncourt has discretion as a “gatekeeper” to determine “whether the matter relied on [by an\nexpert] can provide a reasonable basis for the opinion or whether that opinion is based on a\nleap of logic or conjecture.” (Sargon, at pp. 771-772.) Defendants fail to establish that the\ntrial court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiff’s expert’s opinion regarding BLL\n\n\n52\n       Defendants repeatedly insist that the court ordered abatement of “intact” lead paint.\nThis insistence is misleading. With the exception of doors and windows, intact lead paint\non large surfaces such as walls would not be removed. Instead, paint stabilization\ntechniques would be applied to ensure that it remained intact. Lead-contaminated soil\nwould be covered or removed depending on its concentration. Windows and doors that had\nbeen painted with lead paint would be replaced, as no other remediation would be effective.\nThus, the court did not order abatement of all “intact” lead paint in the 10 jurisdictions. The\nabatement plan targeted only the highest risks, while avoiding the creation of additional\nrisks of contamination that might follow from the removal of all intact lead paint.\n                                              61\n\freductions had a reasonable basis. Since the evidence was properly admitted, the trial court\nwas entitled to credit it. The substance of defendants’ argument is that the trial court should\nnot have credited this testimony, but an appellate court must defer to a trial court’s\ncredibility determinations. We reject this contention.\n\n\n                                           B. Public Right\n       Defendants contend that plaintiff failed to establish that interior residential lead paint\n                                      53\ninterferes with any “public right.”\n       “ ‘Anything which is injurious to health . . . or is indecent or offensive to the senses,\nor an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the comfortable\nenjoyment of life or property . . . is a nuisance.’ (Civ. Code, § 3479, italics added.) ‘A\npublic nuisance is one which affects at the same time an entire community or neighborhood,\nor any considerable number of persons, although the extent of the annoyance or damage\ninflicted upon individuals may be unequal.’ (Civ. Code, § 3480[, italics added].) . . . [¶]\n‘[P]ublic nuisances are offenses against, or interferences with, the exercise of rights\ncommon to the public.’ (People ex rel. Gallo v. Acuna (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1408111\"><a href=\"/opinion/1408111/people-ex-rel-gallo-v-acuna/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1103 [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

It is substantial if it causes significant harm and\nunreasonable if its social utility is outweighed by the gravity of the harm inflicted. ([Ibid].)”\n(Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 305.)\n\n\n\n\n53\n       They also claim that, “if this were a factual question, not a legal one,” we would be\nprecluded from inferring a trial court finding on it because the trial court failed to identify\nany “public right” in its statement of decision even though it was pointed out to the court in\nobjections. However, they concede that this is a legal issue, and we agree.\n                                                 62\n\f       Defendants concede that a “public right is one relating to common resources,” but\nthey contend that interior residential lead paint does not interfere with any “public right”\nbecause it causes only private harms in private residences. They claim that the trial court\nerroneously based its public nuisance finding on an “aggregation of private harms.”\nDefendants contend that a public nuisance can exist only if it “harm[s] people in their\nexercise of a public right.” (Italics added.)\n       Interior residential lead paint that is in a dangerous condition does not merely pose a\nrisk of private harm in private residences. The community has a collective social interest in\nthe safety of children in residential housing. Interior residential lead paint interferes with\nthe community’s “public right” to housing that does not poison children. This interference\nseriously threatens to cause grave harm to the physical health of the community’s children.\nDefendants cite no California authority for their claim that no public right is threatened by\ninterior residential lead paint, and we reject their reliance on Rhode Island and Illinois cases\napplying those states’ laws, which they seem to concede are not as broad as California’s.\n       Defendants argue that “[t]he ‘public’ has no right to be present inside a private home,\nand thus, any possible lead exposure inside a private home cannot occur in the exercise of\nany public right.” Most members of the “public” reside in residential housing, and we do\nnot accept defendants’ claim that, unlike streets, residential housing is not a shared\ncommunity resource. Residential housing, like water, electricity, natural gas, and sewer\nservices, is an essential community resource. Indeed, without residential housing, it would\nbe nearly impossible for the “public” to obtain access to water, electricity, gas, and sewer\nservices. Pervasive lead exposure in residential housing threatens the public right to\nessential community resources. We reject defendants’ contention that interior residential\nlead paint cannot interfere with a public right.\n\n\n\n\n                                                63\n\f         C. Regulatory Standards, Nuisance Per Se, and Separation of Powers\n       Defendants claim that interior residential lead paint cannot be a public nuisance\nbecause it does not violate any regulatory standards, and “[t]he court must follow state\nregulations declaring intact LBP [lead-based paint] not a hazard, even on friction surfaces.\n(H&S Code §17920.10.)”\n       “Nothing which is done or maintained under the express authority of a statute can be\ndeemed a nuisance.” (Civ. Code, § 3482.) Health and Safety Code section 17920.10 does\nnot “declar[e]” that “intact” lead paint is “not a hazard.” This statute provides that buildings\nthat contain “lead hazards,” as it defines them “for the purposes of this part” (primarily\n                                                                            54\ndeteriorated lead paint), are in violation of the Health and Safety Code.        (Health & Saf.\n\n\n\n54\n        Health and Safety Code section 17920.10 provides: “(a) Any building or portion\nthereof including any dwelling unit, guestroom, or suite of rooms, or portion thereof, or the\npremises on which it is located, is deemed to be in violation of this part as to any portion\nthat contains lead hazards. For purposes of this part, ‘lead hazards’ means deteriorated\nlead-based paint, lead-contaminated dust, lead-contaminated soil, or disturbing lead-based\npaint without containment, if one or more of these hazards are present in one or more\nlocations in amounts that are equal to or exceed the amounts of lead established for these\nterms in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 35001) of Division 1 of Title 17 of the\nCalifornia Code of Regulations or by this section and that are likely to endanger the health\nof the public or the occupants thereof as a result of their proximity to the public or the\noccupants thereof. [¶] (b) In the absence of new regulations adopted by the State\nDepartment of Health Services in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of\nDivision 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) further interpreting or clarifying the terms\n‘deteriorated lead-based paint,’ ‘lead-based paint,’ ‘lead-contaminated dust,’ ‘containment,’\nor ‘lead-contaminated soil,’ regulations in Chapter 8 (commencing with Section 35001) of\nDivision 1 of Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations adopted by the State\nDepartment of Health Services pursuant to Sections 105250 and 124150 shall interpret or\nclarify these terms. If the State Department of Health Services adopts new regulations\ndefining these terms, the new regulations shall supersede the prior regulations for the\npurposes of this part. [¶] (c) In the absence of new regulations adopted by the State\nDepartment of Health Services in accordance with the rulemaking provisions of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act defining the term ‘disturbing lead-based paint without\ncontainment’ or modifying the term ‘deteriorated lead-based paint,’ for purposes of this part\n‘disturbing lead-based paint without containment’ and ‘deteriorated lead-based paint’ shall\n                                              64\n\fCode, § 17920.10, subd. (a).) Nowhere in this statute does the Legislature declare that any\nother type of lead paint in buildings is not a hazard, is lawful, or is authorized by statute.\nAll that this statute does is identify certain defined “lead hazards” as violations of the Health\nand Safety Code. The mere fact that not all interior residential lead paint violates the Health\nand Safety Code does not mean that it cannot be abated as a public nuisance. “ ‘A statutory\nsanction cannot be pleaded in justification of acts which by the general rules of law\nconstitute a nuisance, unless the acts complained of are authorized by the express terms of\nthe statute under which the justification is made, or by the plainest and most necessary\nimplication from the powers expressly conferred, so that it can be fairly stated that the\nlegislature contemplated the doing of the very act which occasions the injury.’ ” (Hassell v.\nCity and County of San Francisco (1938) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1426178\"><a href=\"/opinion/1426178/hassell-v-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171.)\n       Nor does the absence of a regulation or statute declaring interior residential lead\npaint to be unlawful bar a court from declaring it to be a public nuisance. “The fact that a\nbuilding was constructed in accordance with all existing statutes does not immunize it from\nsubsequent abatement as a public nuisance. . . . It would be an unreasonable limitation on\nthe powers of the city to require that this [presently existing] danger be tolerated ad\n\n\nbe considered lead hazards as described in subdivision (a) only if the aggregate affected\narea is equal to or in excess of one of the following: [¶] (1) Two square feet in any one\ninterior room or space. [¶] (2) Twenty square feet on exterior surfaces. [¶] (3) Ten\npercent of the surface area on the interior or exterior type of component with a small surface\narea. Examples include window sills, baseboards, and trim. [¶] (d) Notwithstanding\nsubdivision (c), ‘disturbing lead-based paint without containment’ and ‘deteriorated lead-\nbased paint’ shall be considered lead hazards, for purposes of this part, if it is determined\nthat an area smaller than those specified in subdivision (c) is associated with a person with a\nblood lead level equal to or greater than 10 micrograms per deciliter. [¶] (e) If the State\nDepartment of Health Services adopts regulations defining or redefining the terms\n‘deteriorated lead-based paint,’ ‘lead-contaminated dust,’ ‘lead-contaminated soil,’\n‘disturbing lead-based paint without containment,’ ‘containment,’ or ‘lead-based paint,’ the\neffective date of the new regulations shall be deferred for a minimum of three months after\ntheir approval by the Office of Administrative Law and the regulations shall take effect on\nthe next July 1 or January 1 following that three-month period. Until the new definitions\napply, the prior definition shall apply.”\n                                               65\n\finfinitum merely because the [building] did not violate the statutes in effect when it was\nconstructed 36 years ago.” (Miller, supra, 64 Cal.2d at pp. 101-102.)\n          Defendants contend: “[T]he trial court declared lead paint to be a nuisance by\ncategory. This inverts the role of the two branches of government, because only the\nLegislature has the power to choose between declaring a nuisance per se and finding a\nnuisance in specific circumstances.” The trial court did no such thing. “Generally a\nnuisance is defined as ‘[a]nything which is injurious to health, or is indecent or offensive to\nthe senses, or an obstruction to the free use of property, so as to interfere with the\ncomfortable enjoyment of life or property . . . .’ (Civ. Code, § 3479.) This requires\nconsideration and balancing of a variety of factors. [Citations.] However, where the law\nexpressly declares something to be a nuisance, then no inquiry beyond its existence need be\nmade and in this sense its mere existence is said to be a nuisance per se. [Citation.] But, to\nrephrase the rule, to be considered a nuisance per se the object, substance, activity or\ncircumstance at issue must be expressly declared to be a nuisance by its very existence by\nsome applicable law.” (Beck, supra, 44 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1206-1207.)\n          The trial court did not declare the “very existence” of lead paint or even interior\nresidential lead paint to be a public nuisance. The court crafted a very limited order\nrequiring abatement of only deteriorated interior lead paint, lead paint on friction surfaces,\nand lead-contaminated soil at residences in the 10 jurisdictions. It did not find that lead\npaint itself is a nuisance per se but only that the specific targets of its order produce or\ncontain lead that has been shown to threaten the safety of children in their homes. It is only\nunder these limited circumstances that lead paint poses an immediate threat to the health of\nchildren and must be abated as a public nuisance. The court’s order was well within the\ngeneral authority of Civil Code section 3479, so its order was not a declaration of a nuisance\nper se.\n          Defendants argue that the trial court’s order violated separation of powers principles\nbecause the Legislature chose in 2001 not to declare the presence of lead paint in a\n\n                                                 66\n\fresidence to be a nuisance. They assert that the Legislature rejected a 2001 bill that would\nhave declared the presence of lead paint in a residence to be a public nuisance and instead\nenacted a statute that “permits owners to maintain intact LBP in residences.” Defendants\nmisrepresent the nature of the Legislature’s 2001 actions. The unpassed bill, Assembly Bill\nNo. 422 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) would have enacted a statute providing that “[a]ny\ncondition on real property that a local health department has determined poses a lead hazard\nrisk to public children is a public nuisance for purposes of Section 3479 of the Civil Code.”\n(Assem. Bill No. 422 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as introduced and amended Feb. 20, 2001.)\nThis bill was not limited to residences, did not address “intact” lead paint, and did not\npropose to declare anything to be a public nuisance absent a determination by a local\nagency. The enacted bill, Senate Bill No. 460, was directed toward lead hazard abatement.\nIt enacted Health and Safety Code section 17920.10, providing that a “dwelling” would be\n“deemed untenantable” if it “contains lead hazards” as defined (primarily deteriorated lead\npaint). Senate Bill No. 460 also enacted Health and Safety Code section 17980, which\nmandated that an “enforcement agency” that “determined” a building contained “lead\nhazards” “shall commence proceedings to abate the violation by repair, rehabilitation,\nvacation, or demolition of the building.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 17980, subd. (b)(1).) And\nit provided for criminal charges against a person who did not comply with such an\nabatement order. (Health & Saf. Code, § 105256.)\n       First of all, “[u]npassed bills, as evidences of legislative intent, have little value.”\n(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604071\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604071/dyna-med-inc-v-fair-employment-housing-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1396.)\nFurthermore, the Legislature’s 2001 actions cannot reasonably be viewed as rejecting the\npossibility that conditions created by lead paint in the interiors of residences that posed an\nimminent danger to children could constitute public nuisances. By authorizing abatement\nactions for lead hazards and criminal charges against those who did not comply with\nabatement orders, the Legislature took a strong stance against lead hazards in dwellings by\nenacting Senate Bill No. 460. Assembly Bill No. 422, unlike Senate Bill No. 460 and the\n\n                                                67\n\ftrial court’s order, was not limited to dwellings and gave local health departments the power\nto declare “real property” to be a public nuisance. The Legislature’s rejection of Assembly\nBill No. 422 was therefore not a rejection of the potential for a court to conclude that certain\nconditions created by lead paint in the interiors of residences and posing an imminent\ndanger to children were public nuisances.\n       Defendants also submit an extended argument that the trial court’s order has adverse\npolicy implications. We are not persuaded that these arguments could support a reversal of\nthe trial court’s abatement order. It may well be that a multi-pronged approach to this\nproblem will be necessary, with the court’s abatement order serving as merely one of\nseveral methods necessary to resolve this problem. What the evidence in this case\ndemonstrates is that defendants are wrong in claiming that California’s statutory scheme\ncreating the CLPPB and local CLPPPs fully addresses childhood lead exposure.\n       The CLPPB’s $28 million annual budget is largely funded by a special fee called the\nChildhood Lead Poisoning Prevention fee, and also by Medi-Cal, the EPA, the CDC, and a\nspecial fund for lead-related construction. The Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention fee,\nwhich provides about $20 million a year, is funded by the industries that put lead into the\nenvironment. About 14 percent of those fees are paid by makers and former makers of\n                              55\n“architectural coatings.”          The vast majority of the fees are paid by motor vehicle fuel\n                56\ndistributors.        Even with the CLPPB, local CLPPPs, and state statutes addressing lead\n\n\n\n\n55\n        “ ‘Architectural coating’ means any product which is used as, or usable as, a coating\napplied to the interior or exterior surfaces of stationary structures and their appurtenances,\nto portable buildings, to pavements, or to curbs, such as house and trim paints, varnishes,\nstains, lacquers, industrial maintenance coatings, primers, undercoaters, and traffic\ncoatings.” (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 33002.)\n56\n       Motor vehicle fuel contained lead from the 1920s until it began to be phased out in\nthe 1970s and 1980s. It was not eliminated until the 1990s. The percentages were not\nbased on distribution of lead into the environment by the products but on the amount of lead\nused in the products.\n                                                     68\n\fhazards, many children in the 10 jurisdictions continue to suffer serious harm from lead\npaint in their homes.\n       The evidence presented at trial demonstrated that the trial court’s abatement order\nwill reduce the risk of further harm to children in the 10 jurisdictions from lead paint. The\nLegislature has not precluded courts from utilizing public nuisance law to prevent further\nharm, and we are aware of no public policy reason to preclude courts from taking such\nactions. Lead poisoning has been estimated to cost society $50 billion a year. For every\ndollar that is spent on preventing lead exposure, there is a savings to society of between $17\nand $220. We reject defendants’ claims that the court’s abatement order usurps the\nLegislature’s powers.\n\n\n                               D. Joint and Several Liability\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in imposing joint and several liability.\nThey claim that this resulted in a “disproportionate, unfair burden” being placed on each of\nthem when many people were involved in the creation of the nuisance.\n       The trial court expressly found that “[d]efendants offered no evidence that an\nabatement remedy can be apportioned” and that the remedy was indivisible. While liability\noften may be capable of apportionment in a public nuisance case, “[t]here are other cases in\nwhich the harm resulting from a nuisance is not capable of apportionment to the several\ncontributors upon any reasonable or rational basis.” (Rest.2d. Torts, § 840E, com. c.) Each\ndefendant bore the burden of producing evidence upon which an apportionment could be\nmade. (Rest.2d Torts, § 840E, com. b.) “Unless sufficient evidence permits the factfinder\nto determine that damages are divisible, they are indivisible.” (Rest.3d Torts:\nApportionment of Liability, § 26, com. g.) When a court determines that apportionment\ncannot be accomplished, each defendant who contributed is liable for the entire harm.\n(Rest.2d Torts, § 840E, com. c.)\n\n\n\n                                              69\n\f       “Where several persons act in concert and damages result from their joint tort, each\nperson is held for the entire damages unless segregation as to causation can be established.\nEven though persons are not acting in concert, if the result produced by their acts are [sic]\nindivisible, each person is held liable for the whole. . . . The reason for imposing liability\non each for the entire consequence is that there exists no basis for dividing damages and the\nlaw is loath to permit an innocent plaintiff to suffer as against a wrongdoing defendant.\nThis liability is imposed where each cause is sufficient in itself as well as where each cause\nis required to produce the result. [¶] . . . [T]he same reason[s] of policy and justice shift\nthe burden to each of defendants to absolve himself if he can—relieving the wronged person\nof the duty of apportioning the injury to a particular defendant, apply here where we are\nconcerned with whether plaintiff is required to supply evidence for the apportionment of\ndamages. If defendants are independent tort feasors and thus each liable for the damage\ncaused by him alone, and, at least, where the matter of apportionment is incapable of proof,\nthe innocent wronged party should not be deprived of his right to redress. The wrongdoers\nshould be left to work out between themselves an apportionment.” (Finnegan v. Royal\nRealty Co.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">776</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796-797.)\n       The trial court determined that defendants had failed to establish that the public\nnuisance was divisible, and we review this factual finding for substantial evidence. Only\nSWC argues that it presented evidence supporting an apportionment. SWC asserts that it\n\n                                                 70\n\fwas responsible for only a tiny percentage of “the total lead used in California from 1894 to\n2009,” that it paid its share of the CLPP fee, and that “thousands of persons contributed” to\nthe presence of lead paint inside residences. The trial court could reasonably conclude that\nSWC’s evidence did not support an apportionment of liability for the public nuisance\ncreated by the promotion of lead paint for interior residential use by defendants. The\nevidence presented at trial did not establish that an entity’s share of the total amount of lead\nused in California bore any relationship to that entity’s liability for the amount of lead paint\npresent in residences in the 10 jurisdictions. The evidence presented at trial indicated that\nnonresidential uses of lead have been the historically predominant ones. The Legislature’s\nestablishment of the CLPP fee was not intended to limit liability for promotion of lead paint\nfor interior residential use, as that fee was not premised on such conduct but merely on total\nlead contribution. Finally, SWC did not establish that the “thousands of persons” who were\nalso involved in the use of lead paint inside residences (painters, architects, homeowners,\netc.) promoted the use of lead paint inside residences with knowledge of the danger such\nuse would produce. Thus, those persons were not joint tortfeasors with defendants. Since\ndefendants failed to show that the public nuisance was divisible, we uphold the trial court’s\nimposition of joint and several liability for the nuisance created by defendants’ conduct.\n\n\n                          E. Collective Liability and Due Process\n       Defendants argue that the court erred in “categorically declar[ing] all properties with\ninterior LBP to be a nuisance sight unseen.” Defendants maintain that the court’s finding of\na “collective nuisance” deprived them of due process because they did not have the\nopportunity to inspect each individual property and defend against their liability on a\nresidence-by-residence basis. They insist that plaintiff was required to identify the location\nof each individual property in order to establish a public nuisance. Defendants claim that\nthe court’s order cannot be upheld because there was no evidence that any individual\ndefendant’s lead was present in any specific location. They assert that access to individual\n\n                                               71\n\fproperties would have permitted each of them to “rule out the presence of its WLC [white\nlead carbonate], to develop evidence of the primary lead sources, to prove the owner’s fault,\nor to show that its WLC, if present, posed no imminent threat of harm to any child.” They\ncontend that due process forbids requiring any one defendant to abate a nuisance created by\n“others’ products.”\n       The trial court did not “declare” all interior lead paint to be a public nuisance.\nInstead, the court’s abatement order was limited to conditions created by interior residential\nlead paint that placed children at imminent risk of harm. Due to the nature of the conduct\nthat defendants engaged in, knowingly promoting lead paint for interior residential use\nthroughout a vast area that is home to millions of people, every one of the precise locations\nat which these conditions currently exist has not yet been fully catalogued. Plaintiff\nestablished the existence of a public nuisance by proving that these conditions are pervasive\nin the 10 jurisdictions, but the enormous cost of discovering each and every one of the\nspecific locations where remediation is necessary must be borne by the wrongdoers, in this\ncase defendants. It cannot be that the highly insidious character of the public nuisance\ncreated by defendants renders it beyond the reach of a public nuisance abatement action.\n       Defendants were not deprived of due process because they were not provided with\naccess to individual properties. None of the defendants claimed that it could differentiate\n“its” lead paint from other lead paint at an individual location. And even if a defendant\ncould have proved that its paint was present in only a portion of the individual properties,\nthe identity of the manufacturer of lead paint at a specific location was of limited relevance.\nDefendants were held liable for promoting lead paint for interior residential use. Their\npromotional activities were not limited to advertisements for their own lead paints. They\nalso generically promoted lead paint for interior residential use. Furthermore, nothing\nprecludes a defendant from testing the lead paint at specific locations during the remediation\nprocess and seeking to hold a fellow defendant liable for a greater share of the\n\n\n\n                                               72\n\fresponsibility. The same is true of evidence that the hazardous condition is “the owner’s\nfault” or that it is not hazardous.\n       None of the cases defendants rely upon has any import on this issue. Defendants rely\non class certification cases stating that a defendant has a right to assert individual defenses\nto each class member’s entitlement to recover. (Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Disproportionality and Due Process\n       Defendants argue that the court’s abatement order violates due process because it\n“grossly exceeds” their individual responsibility for the nuisance.\n       The trial court found that defendants promoted lead paint for interior residential use\nin the 10 jurisdictions and that their conduct was a substantial factor in creating the existing\npublic nuisance that requires remediation. Since their conduct caused the existing public\nnuisance that they are being ordered to abate, the burden of that remediation is not\ndisproportional to their individual responsibilities for assisting in its creation. Defendants’\nreliance on punitive damages and penalty cases is misplaced. Here, defendants are not\nbeing penalized or required to pay damages of any kind. They are being required simply to\n\n\n\n                                               73\n\fclean up the hazardous conditions that they assisted in creating. Requiring them to do so is\nnot disproportional to their wrongdoing.\n       Defendants also complain that the trial court imposed “retroactive liability” “in\nhindsight.” Not so. The only conduct for which defendants are being held responsible is\ntheir promotion of lead paint for interior residential use knowing of the public health hazard\nthat such use would create. There is no “hindsight” or “retroactive liability” involved in\nrequiring those who knowingly engage in hazardous conduct to remediate the consequences\nof their conduct.\n\n\n                                    G. Denial of Jury Trial\n       Defendants claim that the trial court erred in denying them a jury trial. They\nmaintain that the California Constitution guaranteed them a right to a jury trial in this public\nnuisance action by the government even though this was an equitable action seeking only\nabatement because, they argue, the common law in 1850 recognized a right to a jury trial in\npublic nuisance actions except for an action based on a nuisance per se.\n       Plaintiff, NL, and ConAgra filed jury demands. However, plaintiff subsequently\nfiled a motion to strike the jury demands and to have a court trial. Plaintiff asserted that\nthere was no right to jury trial on a public nuisance cause of action seeking abatement or on\na cause of action for equitable contribution or declaratory relief. Defendants opposed\nplaintiff’s motion to strike the jury demands. The court granted plaintiff’s motion and\nstruck the jury demands, and the case was tried to the court.\n       “Trial by jury is an inviolate right and shall be secured to all . . . .” (Cal. Const., art.\nI, § 16.) Generally, “if the action is essentially one in equity and the relief sought ‘depends\nupon the application of equitable doctrines,’ the parties are not entitled to a jury trial.” (C &\nK Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co.

However, “[i]t is\nsettled that the state constitutional right to a jury trial ‘is the right as it existed at common\nlaw in 1850, when the Constitution was first adopted, “and what that right is, is a purely\n\n                                                74\n\fhistorical question, a fact which is to be ascertained like any other social, political or legal\nfact.” [Citations.]’ ” (Franchise Tax Bd. v.

[Citation.] Thus, the scope of the constitutional right to jury trial depends on the\nprovisions for jury trial at common law. The historical analysis of the common law right to\njury often relies on the traditional distinction between courts at law, in which a jury sat, and\ncourts of equity, in which there was no jury.” (Crouchman v. Superior Court (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1181056\"><a href=\"/opinion/1181056/crouchman-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1175.)\n       “In determining whether the action was one triable by a jury at common law, the\ncourt is not bound by the form of the action but rather by the nature of the rights involved\nand the facts of the particular case—the gist of the action. A jury trial must be granted\nwhere the gist of the action is legal, where the action is in reality cognizable at law.\n[¶] . . . The constitutional right of trial by jury is not to be narrowly construed. It is not\nlimited strictly to those cases in which it existed before the adoption of the Constitution but\nis extended to cases of like nature as may afterwards arise. It embraces cases of the same\nclass thereafter arising.” (People v. One 1941 Chevrolet Coupe (1951) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299-\n300 (One 1941).)\n       The question before us is whether in 1850 the common law recognized a right to a\njury trial in public nuisance actions by the government that sought only abatement or in\n“cases of like nature.” At the outset, we must consider exactly what cases are of “like\nnature” to the one before us. Many of the cases relied on by the parties are private nuisance,\nrather than public nuisance, cases. Others sought damages, rather than or in addition to\nequitable relief. Still others sought an injunction, but the nature of the injunction was not\nremedial, but preventative, or was an interlocutory injunction pending trial, rather than\npermanent relief after a full trial.\n\n\n\n                                                75\n\f       “Unlike public nuisance, which is an interference with the rights of the community at\nlarge, private nuisance is a civil wrong based on disturbance of rights in land. [Citation.] A\nnuisance may be both public and private, but to proceed on a private nuisance theory the\nplaintiff must prove an injury specifically referable to the use and enjoyment of his or her\nland. The injury, however, need not be different in kind from that suffered by the general\npublic.” (Koll-Irvine Center Property Owners Assn. v. County of Orange (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1041.) While damages may be available in both public and private\nnuisance actions, damages are not an available remedy in the type of public nuisance action\nthat was brought by plaintiff in this case, a representative public nuisance action.\n“[A]lthough California’s general nuisance statute expressly permits the recovery of\ndamages in a public nuisance action brought by a specially injured party, it does not grant a\ndamage remedy in actions brought on behalf of the People to abate a public nuisance.”\n(People ex rel. Van de Kamp v. American Art Enterprises, Inc. (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612723\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612723/people-ex-rel-van-de-kamp-v-american-art-enterprises/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333,\nfn. 11.) Code of Civil Procedure section 731 permits such an action to “abate a public\nnuisance,” but it does not allow the government to seek damages.\n       Because public and private nuisance actions are distinct, and public nuisance actions\nbrought as representative actions are different from those brought by the government on its\nown behalf, our examination of this issue must focus on whether the common law in 1850\ngranted a right to a jury trial in a representative public nuisance action by the government\nseeking only abatement.\n       Defendants rely heavily on an 1849 treatise written by United States Supreme Court\nJustice Joseph Story. The Fifth Edition of this treatise explained that a “public nuisance”\nwas traditionally punished by way of an indictment. It went on to say: “But an information\nalso lies in Equity to redress the grievance by way of injunction. . . . If the soil does not\nbelong to the crown, but it is merely a common nuisance to all the public, an information in\nEquity lies. But the question of nuisance or not must, in cases of doubt, be tried by a jury;\n\n\n\n                                               76\n\fand the injunction will be granted or not, as that fact is decided.” (Story’s Commentaries on\nEquity Jurisprudence as administered in England (5th ed. 1849) chpt. XXIII, § 923, p. 251.)\n       Justice Story’s treatise provides some support for defendants’ claim that they were\nentitled to a jury trial in this case. However, a treatise is not itself sufficient to establish this\nfactual question. We must examine the cases cited by Justice Story as support for this\npassage to determine whether they reflect that a right to a jury trial was recognized in 1850\nfor a representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only abatement.\n       One of the cases cited by Justice Story was The Attorney General v. Cleaver (1811)\n34 Eng.Rep. 297 [18 Ves. Jun. 212] (Cleaver). Cleaver was an action by the Attorney-\nGeneral “at the relation of individuals” seeking a temporary and permanent restraining order\n                                                                                    57\nagainst a manufacturer whose factory was causing injury to nearby residents.             (Ibid.) The\nissue before the court was whether to grant a request for a pretrial injunction. (Ibid.) The\ncourt declined to issue an injunction in advance of a trial on whether the factory constituted\na nuisance. The court stated: “[I]f the soil belongs to the Crown, there is one species of\nremedy for that: the Crown may abate the obstruction; as it is upon the King’s soil. Where\nit is not upon the King’s soil, but merely a public nuisance to all the King’s subjects, though\nthe suit may be in the same form, the law is laid down in treatises [citation] that upon the\nground of public nuisance, and not as an obstruction upon the King’s soil, it is a question of\nfact, which must be tried by a Jury; and, though the suit may be entertained, the Court\nwould be bound to try the fact by the intervention of a Jury.” (Cleaver, at p. 299, italics\nadded.) While Cleaver appears to support the proposition that, as of 1811, a jury trial may\nhave been required in a representative public nuisance action seeking only an injunction, it\n\n\n\n\n57\n        Although the Attorney-General brought the action, the manufacturer asserted that\n“[t]his is not a public prosecution by the Attorney General, but at the relation of several\ninhabitants of the neighbourhood; and there is a wide distinction between the two sorts of\nInformation.” (Cleaver, supra, 34 Eng.Rep at p. 298.)\n                                                 77\n\fis notable that Cleaver did not involve a remedial abatement order but a prohibitory\ninjunction.\n       A subsequent case, Earl of Ripon v. Hobart (1834) 40 Eng.Rep. 65 [also reported at\n47 Eng.Rep. 119] (Earl of Ripon), pointed out the important distinction between a\nprohibitory or preventative injunction and other types of injunctive relief. Earl of Ripon\nconcerned an action brought by the government seeking an injunction to preclude the use of\nsteam engines (instead of windmills) to drain lowlands. (Earl of Ripon, at pp. 65-67.) The\nplaintiffs claimed steam engines would send water more continuously and more quickly into\nthe river than would windmills, thereby putting pressure on and damaging the river’s banks.\n(Earl of Ripon, at p. 65.) The Chancellor refused to grant an injunction. The Chancellor\ndescribed “the rule respecting the relief by injunction, as applied to such cases to be,” which\nit described as cases of “eventual or contingent nuisance.” (Earl of Ripon, at p. 69, italics\nadded.) “If the thing sought to be prohibited is in itself a nuisance, the Court will interfere\nto stay irreparable mischief, without waiting for the result of a trial; and will, according to\nthe circumstances, direct an issue, or allow an action, and, if need be, expedite the\nproceedings, the injunction being in the meantime continued. But where the thing sought to\nbe restrained is not unavoidably and in itself noxious, but only something which may\naccording to circumstances, prove so, then the Court will refuse to interfere until the matter\nhas been tried at law, generally by an action, though, in particular cases, an issue may be\ndirected for the satisfaction of the Court, where an action could not be framed so as to meet\nthe question. [¶] The distinction between the two kinds of erection or operation is obvious,\nand the soundness of that discretion seems undeniable, which would be very slow to\ninterfere where the thing to be stopped, while it is highly beneficial to one party, may very\npossibly be prejudicial to none. The great fitness of pausing much before we interrupt men\nin those modes of enjoying or improving their property which are prima facie harmless, or\neven praiseworthy, is equally manifest; and it is always to be borne in mind that the\njurisdiction of this Court over nuisance by injunction at all is of recent growth, has not till\n\n                                               78\n\fvery lately been much exercised, and has at various times found great reluctance on the part\nof the learned Judges to use it, even in cases where the thing or the act complained of was\nadmitted to be directly and immediately hurtful to the Complainant.” (Ibid.)\n       The explanation given by the Chancellor in Earl of Ripon illuminates the limited\nnature of the rules governing the power of equity courts to grant injunctions that were\nevolving at that time, and that had not been explicated in Cleaver. The Chancellor’s\nreluctance to grant injunctive relief without a jury trial in Earl of Ripon was due to the fact\nthat the nuisance was “contingent,” that is, prospective, and therefore an injunction would\nbar potentially beneficial activity. (Earl of Ripon, supra, 40 Eng.Rep. at p. 69.) That type\nof injunction differs dramatically from a remedial abatement order. When the government\nseeks a remedial abatement order, the nuisance is not contingent, and the remedy does not\nbar some prospective activity. Abatement is restricted to undoing already accomplished\nharmful conditions. The rule described by the Chancellor in Earl of Ripon did not require a\njury trial in cases seeking a remedial abatement order.\n       The remaining cases cited by Justice Story all fall within the rule described in Earl of\nRipon; they concerned prohibitory injunctions against activities that might prove beneficial\nand might not prove to cause the feared harm.

Bucks proposed a plan of repair that would have replaced the oak\njoists that supported the center with new oak joists, but Berks would not agree to that plan.\nBucks was forced to alter its plan and instead repaired its half of the bridge in such a fashion\nthat the old oak joists were left undisturbed and new joists were run only from the center of\nthe bridge to the last pier in Bucks County. (Forbes, at pp. 588-589 [2 My. & Cr., at pp.\n125-126].) The new joists depended on the old joists for support. (Ibid.) Berks then\nnotified Bucks that it intended to cut the old oak joists at the center, thereby depriving the\ncenter of the bridge of any support. (Forbes, at pp. 589-590 [2 My. & Cr., at pp. 126-127].)\nBucks sought a preventative injunction on the ground that the cutting of the old oak joists\nwould create a public nuisance because the center of the bridge would be unsupported.\n(Forbes, at p. 589 [2 My. & Cr., at p. 127].) The court granted a pretrial injunction.\n(Forbes, at p. 590 [2 My. & Cr., at pp. 129-130].)\n                                                80\n\fsomething which may according to circumstances prove to be so, the court will refuse to\ninterfere until the matter has been tried at law by an action; though in particular cases the\ncourt may direct an issue, for its own satisfaction, where an action could not be brought in\nsuch a form as to meet the question. And in applying these principles, if the magnitude of\nthe injury to be dreaded is great, and the risk so imminent that no prudent person would\nthink of incurring it, the court will not refuse its aid for the protection of the complainant’s\nrights, by injunction, on the ground that there is a bare possibility that the anticipated injury\nfrom the noxious erection may not happen.” (Mohawk, at p. 563.) As in Crowder, the\naction in Mohawk was not brought by the government and sought a prohibitory injunction.\n       Baines v. Baker (1752) 27 Eng.Rep. 105 [AMB. 158] (Baines) was a nuisance action\nbrought by a private party seeking an injunction to prevent the building of a hospital near\nthe plaintiff’s property to house patients suffering from smallpox. It was not an action\nbrought by the government, and, like the other cases, it was an action seeking a prohibitory\ninjunction, not a remedial injunction.\n       The remaining English cases cited by defendants are distinguishable on similar\ngrounds. The Attorney General v. The United Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company\n(1861) 54 Eng.Rep. 899 [30 Beav. 287] (Electric Telegraph) was not an action for a\nremedial abatement order. In Electric Telegraph, the Baron and the Attorney General\nsought an “interlocutory injunction” to bar a telegraph company from putting telegraph\nwires in trenches across public highways and on land owned by the Baron. They claimed\nthat the wires created a public nuisance. (Electric Telegraph, at p. 901.) The court found\nthat, as to the Attorney General’s action, it was “very doubtful” whether there was a public\nnuisance and no clear showing of any injury to the public. (Ibid.) Under these\ncircumstances, the court refused to grant an injunction until the Attorney General\n“establish[es] the fact that the act done is a nuisance at law . . . .” (Ibid.) The court stated:\n“This case depends upon a legal right, which must be established to the satisfaction of the\nCourt before the equity can be administered; without it, it would be impossible to say that\n\n                                                81\n\feither the acts of the company or the works amounted to a nuisance. The one side insists\nthat the works cause an obstruction, and, on the other side, persons are found to say they do\nnot; but no tribunal is so fit to try this question of fact as a jury, who will have the assistance\n                                            59\nof a Judge to direct them as to the law.”        (Electric Telegraph, at p. 902.) While the\nElectric Telegraph opinion suggested that a jury trial would be appropriate to determine\nwhether the wires were a public nuisance, the court did not actually speak of a “right” to a\njury trial and did not consider whether a jury trial would be required in a public nuisance\naction seeking only a remedial abatement order. Instead, the court simply found that the\nevidence before it did not justify a finding that the wires were a public nuisance and\ndetermined that this issue would be best tried by a jury in that particular case. Since the\n\n\n59\n        Defendants cite an alternate version of this opinion in a different reporter. In the\nalternate version, the language is significantly different. At the beginning of the alternate\nversion, the court says: “The main question with which I have to deal now is, whether the\nacts complained of do or do not amount to a nuisance. If they did, I should have no\nhesitation in granting an injunction; but I confess I am not at present prepared to do more\nthan send the case to be tried before a jury, in an action at law.” The court then proceeds to\naddress the claims of the Baron and of the Attorney General separately.\n        Defendants quote the following language: “In ordinary cases, where the issue of a\nsuit in equity depends upon a legal right, that right must be ascertained at law before any\nrelief can be granted by this court.” This language appears in the portion of the alternate\nversion addressing the Baron’s claim, not the Attorney General’s claim, and the court took\ngreat pains to distinguish between the two claims. Hence, it is not material to the issue\nbefore us.\n       In the portion of the alternate version addressing the Attorney General’s claim, the\ncourt says: “With regard to the fact of these posts and wires being nuisances, I am by no\nmeans clear, that upon the evidence before me I can determine whether they are or are not\nsuch; at all events, I think I cannot say that they are. In truth, the question, what is a\nnuisance, is one peculiarly fitted for investigation by a jury.” (The Attorney-General v. The\nUnited Kingdom Electric Telegraph Company (1861) The Law Times, vol. V, N.S. at\npp. 338-339.) Even if we were to accept that the alternate version is entitled to credence, it\ndoes not support defendants’ claim. The court was unwilling to issue a preventative\ninjunction because it deemed the evidence before it to be inadequate, and it simply did not\nrule out that it might do so after a trial before a jury. This ruling does not establish that\nthere was a right to a jury trial at that time in a public nuisance action seeking only a\nremedial abatement order.\n                                                   82\n\faction before us did not seek a preventative injunction, and the trial court found the\nevidence sufficient to support a remedial injunction, Electric Telegraph is inapposite.\n       Walter v. Selfe (1851) 64 Eng.Rep. 849 (Walter) was a private nuisance action\nbetween private parties seeking an injunction. (Walter, at p. 851.) The Chancery court\nstated that the parties had “declin[ed] to go before a jury,” and it granted the plaintiffs’\nrequest for an injunction. (Walter, at p. 853.) Nowhere in the Walter opinion is there any\nindication that a public nuisance action by the government seeking only a remedial\ninjunction would have been required to be tried to a jury. Imperial Gas Light and Coke\nCompany v. Broadbent (1859) 11 Eng.Rep. 239 [7 H.L.C. 600] (Imperial) was not a public\nnuisance action but a private nuisance action between private parties in which the plaintiff\nsought an injunction to stop the defendants from manufacturing gas near his house. The\nopinion contains broad language: “There is no doubt whatever that before a perpetual\ninjunction can be granted, the party applying for it must establish his right by a proceeding\nat law.” (Imperial, at p. 242.) Since Imperial was a private nuisance action seeking a\nprohibitory injunction, its statements about the need for a proceeding “at law” (a jury trial)\ncan only be understood as applying in that context.\n       The distinction between prohibitory injunctions and abatement orders was\nrecognized in the 1850s in England. In Attorney-General v. Birmingham Council (1858) 70\nEng.Rep. 220 [4 K.&J. 528] (Birmingham), the plaintiffs sought an abatement order barring\nthe defendants from continuing to pollute a river with sewage. (Birmingham, at p. 220.)\nThe defendants argued before the Chancellor that under Cleaver and Earl of Ripon the\nChancellor should not interfere and should leave the plaintiffs to seek a remedy at common\nlaw. (Birmingham, at p. 223.) The Chancellor rejected this argument and granted an\nabatement injunction. (Birmingham, at p. 228.)\n\n\n\n\n                                               83\n\f                                                                                   60\n       The cases defendants cite from the United States are also distinguishable.

None of\nthese cases contains any indication of whether a jury trial was required at common law in\n1850 in a representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only a remedial\nabatement order.\n       The remaining California cases cited by defendants are similarly distinguishable.\nFarrell v.

The trial court nevertheless entered judgment for the defendants.\n\n\n60\n        Appeal of McClain (1890) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (McClain), which defendants cite in a string\ncite but do not discuss, was an action by a city seeking the destruction of a dam on the\nground that it was a public nuisance. (McClain, at p. 560.) The Pennsylvania Supreme\nCourt stated: “We do not question the power of a court of equity to restrain and abate\npublic nuisances. This is settled by a line of decisions. But the authorities uniformly limit\nthe jurisdiction to cases where the right has first been established at law, or is conceded. It\nwas never intended, and I do not know of a case in the books where a chancellor has\nusurped the functions of a jury, and attempted to decide disputed questions of fact, and pass\nupon conflicting evidence in such cases.” (McClain, at p. 562.) “We think that, under all\nthe circumstances of this case, the defendants are entitled to a trial by jury before their\nproperty shall be condemned as a nuisance, and destroyed.” (McClain, at p. 564.) While\nMcClain was a public nuisance action by the government seeking a remedial abatement\norder, it has little weight as authority because it significantly postdates 1850 (by four\ndecades) and appears to rely heavily on the fact that the requested relief was that private\nproperty be “condemned . . . and destroyed.” The case before us does not threaten the\ndestruction of any of defendants’ private property, and a case from 1890 does not provide\nstrong evidence of what was a common law right in 1850.\n                                              84\n\f(Ibid.) On appeal, the plaintiffs contended that they were entitled to a jury trial, and\ntherefore the trial court had erred in entering judgment contrary to the jury’s verdict. (Ibid.)\nThe court in Farrell relied on Walter and Imperial Gas in finding that there was a right to a\njury trial in this private nuisance action for damages. (Farrell, at pp. 356-357.) It held:\n“[U]nder the English common law as it stood in 1850, at the time it was adopted as the rule\nof decision in this state, ‘if a plaintiff applies for an injunction to restrain a violation of a\ncommon-law right, if either the existence of the right or the fact of its violation be disputed,\nhe must establish that right at law’; or, in other words, by a jury, if one be demanded. We\nconclude, therefore, that the parties here were entitled to a jury trial upon the issues as to\ndamages and that the verdict of the jury thereon was binding.” (Farrell, at p. 357.) Still,\nthe Farrell court emphasized that “the equitable issues . . . are to be determined by the court\nupon findings of fact made by it.” (Farrell, at p. 359, italics added.) Since Farrell was a\nprivate nuisance action seeking damages, it does not tell us whether a jury trial is required in\na representative public nuisance action by the government seeking only a remedial\nabatement order.\n       Pacific Western Oil Co. v.

On appeal, the defendants contended that they had been deprived of\ntheir right to a jury trial, and the court, relying on Farrell, agreed. However, the court\nlimited its holding to situations “wherein both legal and equitable remedies are the subject\nof the action.” (Pacific Western, at p. 69.)\n       Pacific Western partly overruled McCarthy v.

McCarthy was a private nuisance action for damages and\nan injunction. Although a jury rejected the plaintiff’s damages claim, the trial court rejected\nthe jury’s verdict and awarded the plaintiff damages but no injunction. (McCarthy, at\npp. 543-545.) On appeal, the defendant contended that the plaintiff’s action was one in\n\n                                                 85\n\fwhich the defendant was entitled to a jury trial. (McCarthy, at p. 545.) The California\nSupreme Court disagreed. “The prevention or abatement of a nuisance is to be\naccomplished by means of an injunction either prohibitive or mandatory, and an action\ntherefor is within the equitable jurisdiction of the court, and is to be governed by the\nprinciples prevailing in that jurisdiction. [Citations.] The constitution does not give to a\nparty the right to have the issues in such action tried by a jury, nor is the action within those\nin which the legislature has authorized a jury trial.” (McCarthy, at pp. 545-546.) Pacific\nWestern overruled McCarthy to the extent that it held that there was no right to a jury trial\nin a private nuisance action that sought both an injunction and damages. (Pacific Western,\nsupra, 13 Cal.2d at p. 69.)\n       The California Supreme Court has never held that there is or is not a right to a jury\ntrial in a public nuisance action brought by the government that seeks only a remedial\nabatement order. It has held that there is no right to a jury trial in a private nuisance action\nseeking only abatement. Sullivan v. Royer (1887) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Sullivan) was an action to\nabate and enjoin a private nuisance. A jury found for the plaintiff, and the defendant\nappealed, claiming that the jury had been misinstructed. The California Supreme Court held\nthat any jury instruction errors were immaterial because there was no right to a jury trial in\nan equitable action to abate a nuisance. (Sullivan, at pp. 249-250.) The court reached the\nsame holding in Richardson v. City of Eureka (1895) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which was also a private\nnuisance case. (Id. at p. 446.)\n       The California Supreme Court has mentioned in dicta that there is no right to a jury\ntrial in a public nuisance case seeking only abatement. One 1941 was a forfeiture case\nbrought by the government in which the legal owner of the vehicle claimed that he had been\ndenied his constitutional right to a jury trial. (One 1941, supra, 37 Cal.2d at pp. 285-286.)\nThe issue was whether an in rem forfeiture action was a common law action entitled to a\njury trial in 1850. The California Supreme Court compared an in rem forfeiture action to an\naction to abate a public nuisance. “ ‘The right of trial by jury did not exist at common law in\n\n                                               86\n\fa suit to abate a public nuisance.

Hence it is not a constitutional right now. [¶] Automobiles, carriages, wagons,\nhorses, and mules, that are ordinarily used for lawful purposes, cannot be classified with\nnarcotics, gambling paraphernalia, counterfeit coins, diseased cattle, obscene books and\npictures, decayed fruit and fish, unwholesome meat, infected clothing, or other contraband,\nwhich are ordinarily used for an unlawful purpose, and are public nuisances per se. [Fn.\nomitted.] While property kept in violation of law which is incapable of lawful use and\ndeclared to be a nuisance per se may be forfeited without a trial by jury under the police\npower, it does not follow that property ordinarily used for lawful purposes—innocent\nproperty—may be forfeited without a trial by jury where an issue of fact is joined as to\nwhether the property was being used for an unlawful purpose or is to be taken from an\ninnocent owner. There is no general constitutional right to a jury trial in actions for the\nseizure and forfeiture of contraband articles. [Fn. omitted.] But property is not contraband\nor a public nuisance merely because it was instrumental in the commission of a public\noffense.’ ” (One 1941, at pp. 298-299.)\n       In One 1941, the California Supreme Court cited People v. McCaddon (1920) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

McCaddon was a public nuisance action by\nthe government to abate a public nuisance. (McCaddon, at p. 790.) The claim on appeal\nwas that the trial court had erred in denying the defendants a jury trial. (McCaddon, at\np. 791.) The Court of Appeal devoted no significant analysis to the issue, instead stating:\n“[T]he rule is too well established to need discussion here. This being an action for an\ninjunction, neither the constitution nor the statute requires the submission of the issues to a\njury. It is not error to deny a jury in any case where such right was not granted at common\nlaw. [Citations.]” (McCaddon, at p. 792.) Not one of the citations in the court’s string cite\nwas to a public nuisance case.\n\n\n\n                                               87\n\f       Numerous Court of Appeal cases have stated that there is no right to a jury trial in a\npublic nuisance action by the government seeking only abatement. For example, People v.\nFrangadakis (1960) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Frangadakis) was an action by the government to\nabate a public nuisance in which the defendants contended on appeal that they had been\ndeprived of their constitutional right to a jury trial. The Court of Appeal, citing One 1941,\nrejected their contention without substantive analysis. (Frangadakis, at pp. 543, 545-546.)\nPeople v.

This issue is “ ‘ “a purely historical question, a fact which is to be\nascertained like any other social, political or legal fact.” [Citations.]’ ” (Franchise Tax Bd.\nv. Superior Court, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1010.) Defendants have failed to show that the\ntrial court erred in finding that there was not a right to a jury trial under the common law in\n1850 in a representative public nuisance action brought by the government seeking solely a\nremedial abatement order. The historical materials upon which defendants rely reflect that\nrepresentative public nuisance cases brought by the government seeking only remedial\nabatement orders were not exclusively tried in common law courts but could be resolved in\nequity courts by the Chancellors. None of the cases from the 19th century involved a cause\nof action closely analogous to the representative public nuisance cause of action seeking\nonly remedial abatement brought by plaintiff in this action. Given this historical record, we\nmust reject their contention that they were deprived of their right to a jury trial.\n\n\n                                     H.

If, at the end of four years, any funds remain, those monies shall\nbe returned to the paying defendants in the ratio by which the program was initially funded.\nThe Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara, shall have continuing jurisdiction\nover the Plan and its implementation.”\n       Defendants assert that “[t]he [abatement] Plan is nothing more than a thinly-\ndisguised damages award to Plaintiffs for unattributed past harm to private homes over\nwhich Defendants have no control.”\n       “An abatement of a nuisance is accomplished by a court of equity by means of an\ninjunction proper and suitable to the facts of each case.” (Sullivan, supra, 72 Cal. at p. 249.)\n“ ‘[T]he granting, denial, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve a permanent or preliminary\ninjunction rests in the sound discretion of the trial court upon a consideration of all the\nparticular circumstances of each individual case.’ [Citation] Such an order will not be\nmodified or dissolved on appeal except for an abuse of discretion.” (Union Interchange,\nInc. v.

This court acknowledged as\nmuch in Santa Clara I. (Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 310.) The trial court’s\nabatement order in this case did not attempt to award any already-incurred costs to plaintiff\nor to any of the 10 jurisdictions. Instead, the court’s abatement order directed defendants to\ndeposit funds in an abatement fund, which would be utilized to prospectively fund\nremediation of the public nuisance. None of these funds were permitted to be utilized to\nreimburse plaintiff, any of the 10 jurisdictions, or any homeowners for already-incurred\ncosts.\n         The abatement fund was not a “thinly-disguised” damages award. The distinction\nbetween an abatement order and a damages award is stark. An abatement order is an\nequitable remedy, while damages are a legal remedy. An equitable remedy’s sole purpose\nis to eliminate the hazard that is causing prospective harm to the plaintiff. An equitable\nremedy provides no compensation to a plaintiff for prior harm. Damages, on the other\nhand, are directed at compensating the plaintiff for prior accrued harm that has resulted\nfrom the defendant’s wrongful conduct. The distinction between these two types of\nremedies frequently arises in nuisance actions. Generally, continuing nuisances are subject\nto abatement, and permanent nuisances are subject to actions for damages.

As Code\nof Civil Procedure section 731 permits a public entity plaintiff to seek abatement of a public\nnuisance in a representative action, the trial court could properly order abatement as a\nremedy in this case.\n         Here, plaintiff sought the equitable remedy of abatement for the nuisance because the\nhazard created by defendants was continuing to cause harm to children, and that harm could\nbe prevented only by removing the hazard. Plaintiff did not seek to recover for any prior\naccrued harm nor did it seek compensation of any kind. The deposits that the trial court\nrequired defendants to make into the abatement account would be utilized not to\n\n                                               90\n\frecompense anyone for accrued harm but solely to pay for the prospective removal of the\nhazards defendants had created. Furthermore, any funds that had not been utilized for that\nsole purpose by the end of the four-year abatement period were to be returned to defendants.\nWhile the trial court did require defendants to make deposits into the account to provide the\nfunds necessary to carry out the abatement, the court’s estimate of the amount that would be\nnecessary for that purpose was just that: an estimate. The trial court could have chosen to\nhave defendants handle the remediation themselves, but such an order would have been\ndifficult for the court to oversee and for defendants to undertake. The court’s reasonable\ndecision to create a remediation fund overseen by a knowledgeable receiver, and ultimately\nby the court, was not an abuse of discretion under the specific circumstances of this case.\n       Because the trial court’s abatement order did not require defendants to reimburse\nanyone for already incurred costs, defendants’ reliance on County of San Luis Obispo v.\nAbalone Alliance (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Abalone), which this court cited in Santa\nClara I, is misplaced. In Abalone, the county sought to recover $700,000 in costs that it had\nincurred as a result of the defendants’ “blockade . . . .” (Abalone, at p. 859.) The Court of\nAppeal rejected the county’s attempt to characterize these already incurred costs as “costs of\nabatement” so that they could be recovered in a public nuisance abatement action.\n(Abalone, at pp. 859-860.) As the court pointed out, these already-incurred costs were\n“damages,” and therefore not recoverable by a public entity in a public nuisance abatement\naction. (Abalone, at pp. 859-861.)\n       The distinction between an abatement fund and damages was recognized by the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Price (3d Cir. 1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"408168\"><a href=\"/opinion/408168/united-states-v-charles-price-individually-and-dba-prices-trucking/\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(Price). Price was an appeal from the district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction in a\ncase where the defendants were alleged to be responsible for contaminating a city’s water\nsupply. While the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s exercise of its discretion to\ndeny preliminary relief, it pointed out that the district court had taken an “unduly restrictive\nview of its remedial powers . . . .” (Price, at p. 211.) “Damages are awarded as a form of\n\n                                               91\n\fsubstitutional redress. They are intended to compensate a party for an injury suffered or\nother loss. A request for funds for a diagnostic study of the public health threat posed by\nthe continuing contamination and its abatement is not, in any sense, a traditional form of\ndamages. The funding of a diagnostic study in the present case, though it would require\nmonetary payments, would be preventive rather than compensatory. The study is intended\nto be the first step in the remedial process of abating an existing but growing toxic hazard\nwhich, if left unchecked, will result in even graver future injury, i.e., the contamination of\nAtlantic City’s water supply.” (Price, at p. 212.)\n       While the trial court’s order in this case may be unusual in requiring defendants to\nprefund remediation costs, it was well within the court’s discretion. The California\nSupreme Court presciently noted in Santa Clara II that “[t]his case will result, at most, in\ndefendants’ having to expend resources to abate the lead-paint nuisance they allegedly\ncreated, either by paying into a fund dedicated to that abatement purpose or by undertaking\nthe abatement themselves.” (Santa Clara II, supra, 50 Cal.4th at pp. 55-56, italics added.)\nThe abatement fund ordered by the trial court was a reasonable method of prefunding the\nremediation that is required to abate the public nuisance created by defendants. The choice\nof this method was not an abuse of the court’s broad discretion to fashion an appropriate\nabatement injunction.\n       Defendants briefly complain that the trial court erred “by ordering defendants to pay\ninto a plan that provides no judicial oversight, and no mechanism for return of unused funds\nto defendants.” We see no such flaws in the court’s order. The court expressly provided\nthat it would retain jurisdiction “over the Plan and its implementation.” And it explicitly\nordered, “If, at the end of four years, any funds remain, those monies shall be returned to the\npaying defendants in the ratio by which the program was initially funded.” Thus, there is no\nbasis for defendant’s complaints.\n       There is also no merit to defendants’ claim that the abatement fund will somehow be\n“placed into the State treasury . . . .” The trial court’s order explicitly required defendants to\n\n                                               92\n\fdeposit funds into “a specifically designated, dedicated, and restricted abatement fund.” It\nplainly did not require, contemplate, or permit the deposit of those funds into “the State\ntreasury . . . .”\n\n\n                                               I. Laches\n          ConAgra contends that plaintiff’s public nuisance cause of action was barred by\n          61\nlaches.        Plaintiff asserts that laches was not an available defense to its public nuisance\nabatement cause of action. The trial court expressly rejected ConAgra’s laches contention\nin its statement of decision, but ConAgra contends that it is raising solely a legal issue upon\nwhich we exercise independent review. Although a trial court’s decision on a laches issue\nis ordinarily subject to deferential review, the issue of whether laches is a legally available\ndefense is a legal issue subject to de novo review. (City and County of San Francisco v.\nBallard (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392.)\n          Civil Code section 3490 expressly provides that “[n]o lapse of time can legalize a\npublic nuisance, amounting to an actual obstruction of public right.” (Civ. Code, § 3490.)\nConAgra claims that this statute does not apply because interior residential lead paint does\nnot actually obstruct any public right. As we have already explained, plaintiff established\nthat pervasive interior residential lead paint in the housing stock of the 10 jurisdictions\nobstructs the public right to safe housing. An obstruction is something that impedes or\nhinders. (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1993) p. 803.) Interior residential\nlead paint “actual[ly]” impedes or hinders the public right to safe housing because it renders\nunsafe for young children a large amount of residential housing in the 10 jurisdictions. We\n\n\n61\n       Although defendants generally join each other’s contentions, ConAgra’s laches\nargument is premised on facts concerning only itself. NL makes no mention of laches in its\nbriefs. SWC makes only the briefest mention of laches in its opening brief. Because NL\nand SWC have chosen not to argue this issue as to their particular facts, and ConAgra’s\ncontention is premised on facts applicable only to itself, we discuss this issue solely as it\napplies to ConAgra.\n                                                   93\n\freject ConAgra’s claim that interior residential lead paint does not amount to an actual\nobstruction of a public right.\n       ConAgra also claims that Civil Code section 3490 does not apply here because it is\nnot seeking to “legalize” any continuing conduct, such as putting lead paint in residential\nhousing. Nowhere in the text of Civil Code section 3490 do we discern any indication that\nit is limited to continuing conduct. Legalize means to “make legal,” and “legal” means\n“conforming to” the law. (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dict. (10th ed. 1993) p. 664.)\nPublic nuisances are criminal. (Pen. Code, § 372.) The public nuisance created by\ndefendants is not “conforming to” the law, and permitting defendants to avoid responsibility\nfor abating this public nuisance would allow this unlawful public nuisance to continue to\nexist. Under these circumstances, Civil Code section 3490 does apply, and any “lapse of\ntime” does not preclude plaintiff’s action to abate the unlawful public nuisance created by\ndefendants.\n       ConAgra further asserts that “public policy” supports the application of laches in this\ncase. “ ‘Laches is an equitable defense based on the principle that those who neglect their\nrights may be barred from obtaining relief in equity. [Citation.]’ ” (Feduniak v. California\nCoastal Com. (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1381, italics added.) “It is clear, however, that\nneither the doctrine of estoppel nor any other equitable principle may be invoked against a\ngovernmental body where it would operate to defeat the effective operation of a policy\nadopted to protect the public.” (County of San Diego v. California Water & Tel. Co. (1947)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1178618\"><a href=\"/opinion/1178618/county-of-san-diego-v-cal-water-etc-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 826, italics added.)\n       Since laches is an equitable defense, it could not be asserted against the government,\neven if it were not barred by Civil Code section 3490, because such an application would\ndefeat a public policy aimed at protecting the public. Civil Code section 3479 is an\nexpression of the Legislature’s public policy against public nuisances, and it is plainly\naimed at protecting the public from the hazards created by public nuisances.\n\n\n\n                                              94\n\f       Given these conclusions, we need not consider ConAgra’s extended and irrelevant\nargument that the public nuisance it assisted in creating was permanent rather than\ncontinuing. The trial court did not err in rejecting ConAgra’s laches defense.\n\n\n                           J. Procedural and Evidentiary Issues\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in (1) admitting hearsay documents,\npermitting experts to testify about hearsay documents, and considering limited purpose\nhearsay documents for their truth; (2) making a blanket ruling disallowing recross-\nexamination; (3) imposing time limits and rejecting offers of proof and deposition\ndesignations; (4) changing the relevant product from white lead to lead paint during trial;\n(5) not allowing defendants adequate time to analyze the “RASSCLE” database, which was\nnot fully provided to defendants until three weeks before trial; (6) not allowing defendants\n                                                                                                 62\nto inspect specific properties; and (7) not sanctioning plaintiff for spoliation of evidence.\n                                   1. Hearsay Documents\n       Defendants claim that the trial court prejudicially erred in (1) admitting hearsay\ndocuments into evidence under Evidence Code section 1280 that did not meet that statute’s\nrequirements, (2) permitting plaintiff’s expert historians to give opinion testimony based on\nhearsay documents that were not admitted into evidence at trial or were admitted only for a\nlimited purpose, (3) permitting plaintiff’s experts to quote those limited purpose documents\n                                                                                            63\nwhile testifying, and (4) considering limited purpose hearsay documents for their truth.\n\n\n62\n      The trial court advised the parties before trial that an objection by one defendant\nwould be “applicable to” all defendants. The court reiterated this at trial. Hence, we\nanalyze these contentions as to all defendants even if only one of them objected at trial.\n63\n       Defendants’ appellate briefing makes it difficult if not impossible to determine\nprecisely which trial court rulings on defense objections are being challenged on appeal.\nFor instance, ConAgra refers in its brief to some testimony by plaintiff’s expert Markowitz.\nDefendants did not interject any hearsay objections to the testimony of Markowitz to which\nthey refer. At one point, during Markowitz’s testimony, ConAgra’s trial counsel asked the\ncourt whether a Fuller brochure was being admitted for a limited purpose, and the court\n                                               95\n\f                              a. Evidence Code section 1280\n                                       i. Background\n       Near the beginning of trial, defendants submitted a “Memorandum Regarding\nAdmissibility of Scientific and Government Publications.” (Most capitalization omitted.)\nThis memorandum addressed potential exhibits described as “reports and surveys from\nfederal agencies and committees” and a single article from a medical journal. Defendants\nasserted that these documents would not qualify for admission under Evidence Code section\n1280 because they were “not limited to public employees’ records of an act, condition, or\nevent, nor were they written at or near the time of such an act, condition, or event.” They\nalso asserted that plaintiff’s experts could not testify about the contents of these documents\nother than to say that they had relied on them.\n       The trial court did not view this memorandum as an objection to anything: “It is not\nframed as a motion. It is not framed as an objection to testimony. I wasn’t clear what it\nwas supposed to be other than trying to educate me about some legal principles.”\nDefendants explained that they were providing “our explanation for those objections in\nadvance,” and they then objected on hearsay and relevance grounds to plaintiff’s expert\nhistorian Mushak “reading from and potentially offering” “scientific journals and\n\n\nconfirmed that it was. He made no objection. Hence, defendants did not preserve a hearsay\nobjection to this testimony.\n        Defendants cite a written objection that ConAgra filed, objecting to any testimony by\nplaintiff’s expert historian Rosner that Fuller’s promotion of lead paint had “caused” lead\npaint to be present on residences in the 10 jurisdictions. It claimed that Rosner was not\nqualified to offer such testimony and lacked any reliable basis for such testimony. These\nwritten objections did not interject any hearsay objections or relate to the contentions that\ndefendants make on appeal. Defendants cite a defense objection, not on hearsay grounds, to\nthe admission of an exhibit regarding ConAgra’s liability as the successor to Fuller. And\nthey cite ConAgra’s objection on “no foundation and Evidence Code sections 802 and 803”\ngrounds to any testimony by plaintiff’s expert Markowitz that Fuller had knowledge of the\ndangers of lead when it was promoting it. Although the court overruled these objections,\nthere is no apparent relationship between that ruling and defendants’ evidentiary contentions\non appeal.\n                                              96\n\fgovernment reports.” The court noted that Mushak was testifying as an expert and therefore\ncould rely on inadmissible hearsay to support his opinion testimony. It also observed that\n“reports and analysis” that were not admitted for their truth but solely to allow the court to\nevaluate the expert’s testimony could be received into evidence. The court ruled that\n“expert witnesses testifying in this case as a general matter can rely on reports, information,\nwhich might otherwise be designated inadmissible as hearsay.”\n       Defendants clarified that their objection was to the admission of the documents, not\nthe expert’s reliance on hearsay. The trial court reiterated that any hearsay documents relied\non by the experts would not be admitted for their truth but only to evaluate the expert’s\ntestimony. The court subsequently ruled: “First of all, if the documents that are being\nproffered are the product of a public agency, they will be admitted as an exception to the\nhearsay rule under Evidence Code Section 1280. That’s a general proposition I don’t think\nanyone can argue with. Experts who are testifying and who are relying on reports, analysis,\nand so forth, not prepared by themselves but, say, statistical analysis or something like that,\nthose materials can come into evidence for a limited purpose to assist the Court in\nevaluating the expert’s opinion.” No defendant challenged at that time the court’s statement\nthat “documents that . . . are the product of a public agency” are admissible under Evidence\nCode section 1280.\n       Defendants subsequently objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of a 2012\n“monograph” prepared by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) addressing the health\neffects of low-level lead exposure. This monograph was introduced during the testimony of\none of the experts who had helped write it. The court ruled that this document was\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1280. Defendants also objected on hearsay\ngrounds to the admission of a Mineral Resources Yearbook for the year 1922 that had been\nprepared and published by the United States Department of the Interior in 1925. This\ndocument contained statistics for the production and consumption of lead in the United\n\n\n\n                                              97\n\fStates from 1917 to 1922 and a list of the companies that were producing white lead in\n1922, which included Fuller, NL, and SWC.\n                                          ii. Analysis\n       “Evidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made\ninadmissible by the hearsay rule when offered in any civil or criminal proceeding to prove\nthe act, condition, or event if all of the following applies: [¶] (a) The writing was made by\nand within the scope of duty of a public employee. [¶] (b) The writing was made at or near\nthe time of the act, condition, or event. [¶] (c) The sources of information and method and\ntime of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.” (Evid. Code, § 1280.) “A\ntrial court has broad discretion in determining whether a party has established these\nfoundational requirements. [Citation.] Its ruling on admissibility ‘implies whatever finding\nof fact is prerequisite thereto . . . . [Citation.]’ [Citation.] A reviewing court may overturn\nthe trial court’s exercise of discretion ‘ “only upon a clear showing of abuse.” ’ ” (People v.\nMartinez (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615597\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615597/people-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120.)\n       We can see no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s finding that the monograph and\nthe mineral yearbook fell within the parameters of Evidence Code section 1280. Both of\nthese documents demonstrated on their face that they had been prepared by public\nemployees in the scope of their employment. The monograph described an NIH study that\nhad been recently completed and had been extensively peer reviewed, so the trial court\ncould have reasonably concluded that it was a writing made “at or near” the time of the\nstudy and had been prepared using sources and methods that were trustworthy. The mineral\nyearbook was prepared by the Department of the Interior to report on mineral production\nand consumption during what were no doubt the most recent years for which it had\ninformation. The trial court could reasonably conclude that the Department of the Interior\nused trustworthy sources to compile this information.\n       Defendants do not argue the Evidence Code section 1280 issue as to any other\nexhibits except for a summary reference in a footnote to exhibits 8, 17, 19, and 253 as\n\n                                               98\n\fexamples of documents that were admitted into evidence by the trial court over hearsay\nobjections under Evidence Code section 1280. Defendants provide no further detail about\nthese four exhibits, and they do not even provide record citations for the exhibits themselves\nor the rulings on their admission. Instead, they support their claim that these four exhibits\nwere admitted into evidence over hearsay objections with a citation to the court’s general\nunchallenged ruling that “documents that . . . are the product of a public agency” would be\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1280.\n       Despite defendants’ inadequate briefing, we briefly consider the propriety of the\nadmission of these four exhibits. Exhibit 8 is a transcript of a 1910 hearing before a\nCongressional committee. When it was admitted into evidence, the only defense objection\nwas “[c]ontinuing objections,” which the court overruled while citing Evidence Code\nsection 1280. Defendants made no express hearsay objection to the admission of this\nexhibit, and they submit no argument on appeal as to why this official transcript of a\nlegislative hearing was not admissible under Evidence Code section 1280. In any case, we\ncan see no abuse of discretion in the court’s determination that this official transcript was\nadmissible under Evidence Code section 1280. Exhibit 17 is a 2013 CDC “Weekly\nReport,” and one of plaintiff’s experts testified that the CDC published such reports every\nweek. Exhibit 19 is a 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) booklet on childhood lead\npoisoning that was prepared in part by one of plaintiff’s expert witnesses. When these two\nexhibits were admitted into evidence, the defense objected “under 1280 because it is not a\nrecord of an act, condition, or event.” The court overruled the objections. Again,\ndefendants do not detail on appeal why these exhibits did not qualify for admission under\nEvidence Code section 1280. However, we can discern no abuse of discretion in the trial\ncourt’s overruling of the objection. Both exhibits appear to be timely official records of\nconditions.\n       Exhibit 253 is a resolution of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors declaring\nNational Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week in 2012. When this document was\n\n                                              99\n\fmentioned by a witness at trial, the defense objected on “foundation” grounds and because it\nwas “unsigned.” Although the court admitted the document “for all purposes,” it also said\nthat it would “take it in for whatever it is worth” as a “resolution of the Board of\nSupervisors.” The only testimony about this document was that it showed that “[t]he Board\nis basically recognizing that childhood lead poisoning is a significant health issue in Santa\nClara County . . . .” This was not a disputed issue. Defendant makes no argument on\nappeal about how it could have been prejudiced by the admission of this document, and it is\ninconceivable that this document was considered for the truth of any of its recitals. Any\nerror in admitting it “for all purposes” was not prejudicial.\n      b. Expert Testimony Based on Hearsay Documents Not Admitted At Trial\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erred in permitting experts to testify “based on\nhearsay documents that were described at trial but which were, in many instances, never\nadmitted into evidence.” With one exception, none of the record citations that defendants\nprovide to support this contention contains any objection to expert testimony about hearsay\ndocuments that were not admitted into evidence. Instead, the record citations they provide\nin support of this contention are to testimony based on documents that were admitted into\nevidence.\n       The one exception is the following exchange: “Q [by plaintiff’s trial counsel].\nOkay. And, Dr. Markowitz, we have only touched on a handful of documents from either\nthe Lead Industries Association or the National Paint, Varnish, and Lacquer Association\nhere. Are these documents representative of other types of documents that you have seen in\nyour much more extensive research and review of hundreds of thousands of pages of\ndocuments? [¶] MR. GLYNN [DuPont’s trial counsel]: I think that’s improper to now\nbring in a host of undisclosed and undescribed documents. He can testify as to what he has\nbrought to court, not something -- [¶] THE COURT: I get it. You can shorten the\nobjection. The objection is overruled. It is what it is.” Markowitz responded: “Yes.\nThese are representative of many other documents.” Defendants provide in support of this\n\n                                              100\n\fargument no other record citation to any instance of an overruled defense objection to an\n                                                    64\nexpert testifying about an unadmitted document.          As the trial court’s alleged error in\noverruling this objection resulted only in Markowitz’s response to this one question, which\nwas not prejudicial, we reject this contention.\n     c. Permitting Experts to Read Limited Purpose Hearsay Documents Into Record\n        Defendants assert that the court prejudicially erred in permitting experts to read into\nthe record hearsay in documents that had been admitted for a limited purpose. The string of\nrecord citations that defendants provide to support this assertion, which they make without\nsubstantive analysis, primarily demonstrates that the court expressly ruled that the hearsay\nin these documents was being admitted only for a limited purpose. Defendants’ objections\n                                                                                 65\nwere primarily limited to hearsay objections to the documents themselves.\n        However, defendants did make a relevant objection at one point. The defense\nobjected on hearsay grounds to the admission of 1937 and 1939 LIA and NPVLA\ndocuments and a 1930 newspaper article referenced in the LIA documents. The court\nadmitted these documents for the limited purpose of evaluating the expert’s opinion\n\n\n\n64\n       We do note one other similar occurrence. “Q [by plaintiff’s trial counsel]. Were\nthese opinions informed by other documents that you reviewed in [the] historical record?\n[¶] A [by plaintiff’s expert Rosner]. Yes, certainly. [¶] Q. And are the documents you\npresented to the Court as the basis of your expert opinion, representations of what you have\nseen in other documents as well? [¶] A. Yes. [¶] MR. STERN [ARCO’s trial counsel]:\nObjection, your Honor. Without specific discussion of those documents. [¶] THE\nCOURT: Overruled. [¶] THE WITNESS: Yes.” The trial court’s alleged error in\noverruling this objection also was not prejudicial.\n65\n        For instance, the defense objected, apparently on hearsay grounds, to the admission\nof an 1878 medical journal article, and the court ruled that the evidence would be admitted\nfor the limited purpose of evaluating the expert’s opinion. In response to plaintiff’s\nargument for unlimited admission, the court held open the possibility that this article might\nbe admissible to show “notice” if plaintiff produced evidence that a defendant was aware of\nit. ConAgra objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of a 1919 newspaper article\nabout Fuller’s South San Francisco plant. The court ruled that the article was admissible for\na limited purpose.\n                                              101\n\ftestimony, and it permitted the defense to enter a “continuing objection to purported opinion\ntestimony that is based solely on information gleaned from the four corners of the document\n                      66\nbeing referred to.”        Plaintiff’s experts thereafter referenced specific portions of these\ndocuments in their testimony.\n       “If statements related by experts as bases for their opinions are not admitted for their\ntruth, they are not hearsay.” (People v. Sanchez, supra, 63 Cal.4th at p. 681.) “When an\nexpert relies on hearsay to provide case-specific facts, considers the statements as true, and\nrelates them to the [factfinder] as a reliable basis for the expert’s opinion, it cannot logically\nbe asserted that the hearsay content is not offered for its truth.” (Id. at p. 682.) “When an\nexpert is not testifying in the form of a proper hypothetical question and no other evidence\nof the case-specific facts presented has or will be admitted, there is no denying that such\nfacts are being considered by the expert, and offered to the [factfinder], as true.” (Id. at\np. 684.) “If an expert testifies to case-specific out-of-court statements to explain the bases\nfor his opinion, those statements are necessarily considered by the jury for their truth, thus\nrendering them hearsay. Like any other hearsay evidence, it must be properly admitted\nthrough an applicable hearsay exception.” (Ibid.) “What an expert cannot do is relate as\ntrue case-specific facts asserted in hearsay statements, unless they are independently proven\nby competent evidence or are covered by a hearsay exception.” (Id. at p. 686.)\n       The trial court did not err in permitting the experts to testify about the specific\nstatements in these documents that supported their opinions. First, the record does not\nestablish that these documents were not within a hearsay exception. As plaintiff established\nbelow, these documents were more than 30 years old. “Evidence of a statement is not made\ninadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement is contained in a writing more than 30\nyears old and the statement has been since generally acted upon as true by persons having\n\n\n66\n       There is no indication that the trial court or the parties viewed this “continuing\nobjection” as applying to documents other than the LIA and NPVLA documents and the\n1930 newspaper article.\n                                                   102\n\fan interest in the matter.” (Evid. Code, § 1331.) “Ancient documents would have no effect\nor potency as evidence unless they served to import verity to the facts written therein. The\ntrue rule is that an ancient document is admitted in evidence as proof of the facts recited\ntherein, provided the writer would have been competent to testify as to such facts.”\n(Kirkpatrick v. Tapo Oil Co. (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">404</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 411.) Since the authors of the\nLIA and NPVLA documents and the writer of the newspaper article would likely have been\ncompetent to testify to the contents of these writings, and the members of the LIA and the\nNPVLA would have acted upon the statements in these documents being true, defendants\nhave not established that these documents were inadmissible hearsay.\n       Second, the experts were not necessarily relying on the truth of the statements in\nthese documents since their relevance was primarily to show what defendants were aware of\nat the relevant time. Finally, the trial court, which admitted these documents for a limited\npurpose, was well aware of the nature of the limited admissibility of these documents and,\nunlike lay jurors, able to distinguish between the use of the contents for their truth and the\n                                                           67\nuse of the documents as a basis for an expert’s opinion.        We find no prejudicial error in the\ncourt’s rulings with regard to the experts’ references to these documents.\n                 d. Reliance on Hearsay in Limited Purpose Documents\n       Defendants argue that the trial court prejudicially erred in considering for its truth\nhearsay in documents that had been admitted only for a limited purpose. Defendants have\nforfeited this contention because they fail to cite any indication in the record that the trial\ncourt relied on a limited purpose exhibit for the truth of its assertions. The only exhibits\nthey expressly reference are exhibits 18 and 19, which were admitted for all purposes under\nEvidence Code section 1280 and therefore were not limited purpose documents.\n\n\n\n\n67\n      The court stated early on: “[T]hese matters, these reports, analyses, whatever they\nmight be, if they are hearsay are not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but they\nare admitted for the limited purpose to assist me in evaluating the expert’s opinion.”\n                                               103\n\f                                   2. Disallowance of Recross\n       Defendants contend that the trial court prejudicially erred in ruling that there would\nbe no recross-examination during the trial.\n                                        a. Background\n       After redirect of the first trial witness, one of the defense attorneys asked to recross.\nThe court said: “No. No. One round. Direct, cross, redirect. That’s it.” After plaintiff’s\nexpert Rosner testified on redirect, trial counsel for ARCO and DuPont requested recross.\nThe court denied the request. ConAgra’s trial counsel objected to the denial of recross. “If\nthe Court please, I too would like to do a brief recross-examination. May I please have a\ncontinuing objection to the denial of rights under 772 as to any witness where I actually\nparticipated in the cross-examination at issue.” The court allowed him a continuing\nobjection and overruled his objection. SWC’s trial counsel joined ConAgra’s objection\nNL’s trial counsel did not join.\n       After redirect of plaintiff’s expert industrial hygienist Gottesfeld, who had testified\nabout lead inspections and lead assessments, SWC’s trial counsel moved to “strike the\nredirect testimony in light of the denial of recross.” The court denied the motion. It stated:\n“I think the Court has the discretion to alter the order of this. You might want to take a look\nat Evidence Code Section 320. There is some case law about that as well. In any event, I\nthink I am within my province to do that.”\n       After plaintiff’s witness Courtney testified on redirect, SWC’s attorney asked to be\npermitted to “ask two questions as my redirect,” but the court denied the request. SWC had\ndone its direct exam as its cross to save time.\n       During redirect of plaintiff’s expert Markowitz, plaintiff introduced additional\nexhibits. SWC’s trial counsel objected: “[W]ith no chance to cross-examination [sic], they\nchose to proceed by summary. If they botched it, they shouldn’t be able to drop this on us\nafter cross. Your Honor, I object. If they are allowed, I would like an opportunity to study\nthem and have this witness subject to recall so I can cross-examine them fairly and deal\n\n                                              104\n\fwith them later. That’s my objection.” The court overruled the objection. After\nMarkowitz’s redirect, DuPont’s trial counsel asked the court if it would “permit brief\nrecross.” The court said “No.” No other attorney sought recross of Markowitz.\n       After redirect of plaintiff’s final expert witness, SWC’s trial counsel said: “I am\nassuming that your Honor’s standing rule of no recross applies, and we don’t have to ask for\nrecross each time?” The court said: “That is correct.” SWC’s trial counsel then sought to\nstrike the witness’s testimony about an article because he would not have the opportunity to\nask about it on recross. His request was denied.\n       At the close of plaintiff’s case, SWC’s trial counsel moved “to strike the testimony\non redirect for all of the witnesses on the ground we were not permitted recross.” The\nmotion was denied.\n                                         b. Analysis\n       Defendants claim that the trial court’s disallowance of all recross throughout the trial\nwas an arbitrary ruling that cannot be upheld as an exercise of discretion because it allowed\nplaintiff to present evidence on redirect that defendants had no opportunity to confront.\n       “A witness examined by one party may be cross-examined upon any matter within\nthe scope of the direct examination by each other party to the action in such order as the\ncourt directs.” (Evid. Code, § 773, subd. (a).) “ ‘Recross-examination’ is an examination of\na witness by a cross-examiner subsequent to a redirect examination of the witness.” (Evid.\nCode, § 763.) “The examination of a witness shall proceed in the following phases: direct\nexamination, cross-examination, redirect examination, recross-examination, and continuing\nthereafter by redirect and recross-examination.” (Evid. Code, § 772, subd. (a).)\n       Defendants contend that Evidence Code sections 772 and 763 create a right to\nrecross. Neither statute creates any rights. Evidence Code section 763 merely defines\nrecross, and Evidence Code section 772 simply identifies the order in which the various\nphases of witness examination, including recross, may occur. If defendants’ contention\nwere accurate, Evidence Code section 772’s mention of re-redirect and re-recross would\n\n                                             105\n\fcreate a right to those uncommon phases of witness examination. Defendants cite no\nauthority for the proposition that Evidence Code section 772 has ever been construed to\ncreate a right to every possible phase of witness examination.\n       Defendants cite an appellate court decision from Illinois for the proposition that a\n                                                       68\nblanket prohibition on recross is never permissible.        In Grundy County Nat. Bank v. Myre\n(1975) 34 Ill.App.3d 287 (Grundy), a bank brought an action to collect from a farmer on an\naccounts receivable that had been assigned to the bank by a farm supply company. (Ibid.)\nThe farmer claimed that the account was overstated by $18,500, which was attributable to a\nnote that the farm supply company had assigned to one of its suppliers and the farmer had\npaid off. The trial court rejected the farmer’s claim that the account was overstated and\nawarded the bank over $30,000. On appeal, the farmer contended that the trial court had\nprejudicially erred in refusing to allow him recross of one of the bank’s witnesses. (Grundy,\nat pp. 287-288.) On direct exam, the witness acknowledged that $18,500 for a carload of a\nparticular type of fertilizer was supposed to be billed to the farmer by the supplier and was\nthe subject of the note. On cross, the witness admitted that he could not tell if that fertilizer\nhad instead been charged to the farmer’s account by the supply company and said that the\nfertilizer was just part of the goods covered by the $18,500 note. On redirect, the witness\ntestified that one of the ledger cards for the farmer’s account showed no fertilizer purchases\nthat could have amounted to a carload or to $18,500. The farmer was denied the\nopportunity for recross. In fact, another ledger card in evidence at the trial showed that\nmore than $20,000 had been charged to the farmer’s account for a carload of that particular\ntype of fertilizer. (Grundy, at pp. 288-289.) Under these circumstances, the Illinois\n\n\n68\n        Defendants’ reliance on a federal Confrontation Clause case is misplaced as the\nConfrontation Clause does not apply in civil cases. (United States v. Baker (9th Cir. 1993)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658352\"><a href=\"/opinion/658352/united-states-v-edward-lee-baker-aka-eddie-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">10</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1374</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1404 [Confrontation Clause permits recross to be barred except where “new\nmatter” was introduced on redirect], overruled on a different point in United States v\nNordby (9th Cir. 2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770329\"><a href=\"/opinion/770329/united-states-v-kayle-nordby/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1059.) The remainder of the cases defendants cite\nare irrelevant because they concerned the right to cross-examination, not the right to recross.\n                                               106\n\fappellate court held that, “[s]ince new matter had been brought out on redirect, and since the\nrefusal to permit recross was clearly prejudicial to defendant’s case, the ruling amounted to\nreversible error.” (Grundy, at p. 290.)\n       Grundy is readily distinguishable. Here, unlike in Grundy, the trial court announced\nat the beginning of the trial that there would be no recross permitted throughout the trial.\nBy making this ruling at the outset, the trial court let trial counsel know that it was their job\nto avoid the need for recross by objecting to any redirect that exceeded the scope of cross.\nThe scope of direct operates as a limit on cross, and the scope of cross in turn limits\nredirect. Even without an opportunity for recross, the cross examiner has a full opportunity\nto address everything that the direct examiner has addressed on direct, and any redirect\ncannot properly delve into new subject matter. In fact, trial counsel for the defense actively\ninterposed objections to the scope of redirect. Some of those objections were sustained, and\nothers were overruled, but defendants do not contend on appeal that the trial court\nprejudicially erred in overruling their specific beyond-the-scope objections.\n       We can see no abuse of discretion in a trial court’s decision that a particular court\ntrial should be conducted without recross. In a court trial, the trial court, as the factfinder,\ncan discern whether the material to be presented is of a type that does not merit repetitive\nexamination of witnesses. In this case, with half a dozen litigants, more than a dozen trial\nattorneys, and predominantly expert witnesses who had been heavily deposed in advance of\ntrial, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that repetitive witness examination\nwould be unduly burdensome and unproductive. Requiring trial counsel to police the scope\nof redirect so as to avoid the need for recross was a reasonable choice for the trial court to\nmake in this case to avoid an undue consumption of the court’s time and resources. The\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting recross at this trial.\n                                          3. Time Limits\n       Defendants challenge the trial court’s imposition of time limits and rejection of their\nposttrial deposition designations and offers of proof.\n\n                                                107\n\f                                             a. Background\n       The parties initially estimated that the trial would last two months. Two months\nbefore trial, the court told the parties that it would allow each side 30 hours to present its\ncase. Defendants objected to this time limit. The court clarified that this limit applied only\nto “witness time” and that a party could seek more time if it could provide a “specific\n                  69\njustification.”        The court told the parties that it anticipated that the case would be tried\nover a one-month period. The parties were ordered “to exchange exhibit lists and the\ncontent and expected testimony time of each witness” and to provide to the court “a list of\nproposed exhibits that are actually intended to be used and witnesses (including a brief\nsummary of testimony and realistic time estimates) . . . .”\n       On June 24, 2013, three weeks before trial, the court went over the lists of witnesses\nand time estimates that the parties had provided. Plaintiff’s time estimate was within the\ncourt’s 30-hour allotment. The defense estimated that it would need 64.25 hours to present\nits case. The court was not satisfied. “The Defendants have to get the number down from\nthe amount of time that they have stated. I am not going to pick a precise number. But to\nget me above the 30 hours is going to take a lot, a lot, to get over that. And just a list of\nnames is not going to do it.”\n       On July 8, 2013, a week before trial, the court informed the parties that, “within\nreason,” deposition testimony would not be counted against the 30-hour limit because the\ncourt could read deposition testimony “a lot quicker, obviously, than having somebody on\nthe witness stand testifying.” However, the court would count deposition testimony against\nthe limit “if it gets to be excessive . . . .” The court had reviewed the parties’ revised\n\n\n\n\n69\n      The court said: “[T]he time allocation refers to witness time and does not include\nopening statements (if any), pretrial and other motions, closing argument, and other\nprocedural matters requiring Court time.”\n                                                    108\n\fwitness lists and exhibit lists, and, in the court’s view, these lists confirmed that “the 30-\n                          70\nhour limit is correct.”\n       On the first day of trial, the court clarified that the time limit applied only to live\ntestimony. The court explained that, based on pretrial litigation, “it [is] obvious to me that\nwithout specific limits for trial presentation this trial could easily divulge [sic] into a morass\nof side issues and side arguments.” The court increased the time limit to 40 hours per side.\nIt then overruled the defense objections to the time limits.\n       After plaintiff’s expert epidemiologist Lanphear testified, SWC’s trial counsel asked\nto submit an offer of proof of what additional questions he would have asked if he had not\nbeen subject to the time limits. The court acceded to his request to “file something” later.\nDuring the defense case, while the defense still had eight hours of time remaining, SWC\nrequested additional time. The court rejected that request. Near the end of the defense case,\nthe defense asked the court to allow it an additional hour to present a witness on abatement.\nThe court agreed to “be flexible about that, within limits.” The court did not interrupt the\nlengthy testimony by the defense abatement expert. After his testimony, the defense rested\nwithout requesting additional time.\n       When plaintiff presented its first rebuttal witness, the defense asked for 15 minutes to\ncross-examine him. The court granted this request. The defense completed its cross\nwithout being interrupted. After plaintiff’s second rebuttal witness testified, the court\noffered the defense the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, but the defense declined.\nThe defense freely cross-examined plaintiff’s third rebuttal witness without interruption.\n       The trial actually consumed 24 court days. After trial, defendants delivered to the\ncourt 47 binders of proposed deposition designations for 46 witnesses to supplement the\ntrial record. The court rejected 25 of the 47 binders, but it permitted 22 of the binders (for\n\n\n70\n      The court also informed the parties that the defense would have 30 minutes for each\ndefendant for opening statement, but plaintiff would be limited to a single 30-minute\nopening statement for all 10 jurisdictions.\n                                               109\n\f21 witnesses) to be admitted into evidence. The court subsequently rejected defendants’\nrequest for reconsideration of this ruling.\n                                          b. Analysis\n       Defendants complain that the trial court prejudicially erred in imposing\n“unreasonable time limits” on their examination of witnesses at trial and rejecting their\nefforts to use deposition designations and offers of proof to present evidence outside of\nthose time limits.\n       Defendants appear to believe that Evidence Code section 351 precluded the trial\ncourt from limiting the amount of time they could use for their evidentiary presentation.\nThis statute provides: “Except as otherwise provided by statute, all relevant evidence is\nadmissible.” The fact that relevant evidence is admissible does not mean that a trial court\nmay not restrict a party from making an unduly time-consuming presentation of its\nevidence.\n       We review the trial court’s imposition of time limits for abuse of discretion.\n(California Crane School, Inc. v. National Com. for Certification of Crane Operators\n(2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (Crane).) In Crane, the Fifth District Court of Appeal\nconsidered the merits of court-imposed time limits for a civil trial. We set forth the Fifth\nDistrict’s analysis at some length because it cogently refutes defendants’ contention that\n                          71\ntime limits are forbidden.\n       “Some litigants are of the mistaken opinion that when they are assigned to a court for\ntrial they have camping rights. This view presumes that the trial judge must defer to the\nlawyers’ time estimates for the conduct of the trial such that, for example, when examining\nwitnesses, unless a valid objection is made by one’s opponent, a party is entitled to take\nwhatever time it believes necessary to question each witness. This view is not only contrary\n\n\n71\n       Defendants do not acknowledge the existence of Crane despite the fact that the\nCrane opinion was published in May 2014, well before any of the briefs were filed in this\ncase (beginning in September 2014), and plaintiff cited Crane in its appellate brief.\n                                              110\n\fto law but undermines a trial judge’s obligation to be protective of the court’s time and\nresources as well as the time and interests of trial witnesses, jurors and other litigants\nwaiting in line to have their cases assigned to a courtroom. [Fn. omitted.] The Evidence\nCode expressly empowers trial judges to limit the presentation of evidence, even evidence\nthat is relevant and probative. Evidence Code section 352 authorizes the court to exclude\nevidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its\nadmission will necessitate undue consumption of time. Evidence Code section 765,\nsubdivision (a) provides that the court shall exercise control over the mode of interrogation\nof witnesses ‘so as to make interrogation as rapid, as distinct, and as effective for the\nascertainment of truth.’ Both statutes describe powers that the court may exercise on its\nown initiative. [¶] It is incumbent upon trial judges to manage trials efficiently. Efficiency\nis not necessarily measured by comparing the actual length of a trial with the parties’\noriginal time estimate because parties often overestimate or underestimate a trial’s length.\nJudges need to be proactive from the start in both assessing what a reasonable trial time\nestimate is and in monitoring the trial’s progress so that the case proceeds smoothly without\ndelay. . . . Trial time management is an ongoing responsibility of the trial judge, regardless\nof the case’s complexity, the number of witnesses called or whether specific time limits\nhave been imposed. [¶] . . . [¶]\n       “For those cases in which the trial judge believes time limits should be set, the court\nshould first elicit estimates from the parties and invite each side to comment on the other’s\nestimate. Once the parties have presented their views, the court should independently\nevaluate the estimates based on the arguments of the parties, the state of the pleadings, the\nlegal and factual issues presented, the number of witnesses likely to testify, the court’s trial\nschedule and hours, and the court’s experience in trying similar cases. [¶] . . . [¶]\n       “There are advantages to specifying time limits in court hours rather than court days.\nAn hour time limit imposed on one side would include all time that party spends in\nexamining its own witnesses (direct and redirect) as well as time spent in examining the\n\n                                               111\n\fadverse party’s witnesses (cross and recross). It would include the time spent in delivering\nan opening statement and final argument. As contrasted with a time limit expressed in court\ndays, an hour limit, as described, is not diminished by matters beyond the party’s control,\nsuch as the amount of time an opponent uses to cross-examine said party’s\nwitnesses. . . . The parties are entitled to be kept advised on a regular basis and upon\nrequest of how much time each side has used and has remaining. [Fn. omitted.]\n       “. . . [A]ny time limit order should be reasonable, mindful that each party is entitled\nto a full and fair opportunity to present its case. Trials are a dynamic process without the\nbenefit of a dress rehearsal, which makes forecasting the length of a trial less than precise.\nBut for those parties and attorneys who are fully prepared for trial and do not waste time\nwith repetitive questioning, cumulative evidence, not having witnesses available, or not\nhaving documentary evidence organized and easily accessible, a trial’s length is not an\nissue. Thus, despite the vagaries of trial, when all parties try a case diligently, there is no\nreason for time limits. In all other cases, time limits will provide incentive to be diligent.\n[¶] Any limits imposed should be subject to revision (upward or downward) for good cause\nshown either on a party’s or the court’s own motion. . . . [¶] Not all cases are suitable for\nthe imposition of time limits. More often it is sufficient if the trial judge manages the trial\nin such a way that the trial proceeds efficiently without delays, repetition or dead time.\nHowever, in those cases in which the trial court imposes time limits, it is also important that\nthose limits be enforced.” (Crane, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at pp. 19-22.)\n       The Fifth District’s opinion in Crane provides an excellent explanation of how and\nwhy a civil trial court may use time limits to ensure an efficient trial. In this case, the trial\ncourt did precisely as the Fifth District later recommended. First, the trial court “elicit[ed]\n[time] estimates from the parties.” Second, it “independently evaluate[d] the estimates\nbased on the arguments of the parties, the state of the pleadings, the legal and factual issues\npresented, the number of witnesses likely to testify, the court’s trial schedule and hours, and\nthe court’s experience in trying [complex] cases.” (Crane, supra, 226 Cal.App.4th at p. 20.)\n\n                                               112\n\fThird, the court specified the time limits in court hours, which “provide[d] [the parties]\nincentive to be diligent,” and “kept [the parties] advised on a regular basis . . . of how much\n                                                  72\ntime each side ha[d] used and ha[d] remaining.”        (Crane, at p. 21.) Fourth, the court was\nresponsive to the need to revise its original time limit and to allow additional time at the end\nof the trial when a showing was made that more time was necessary. Indeed, the trial court\nwent to great lengths to ensure that its “reasonable” time limits did not prevent any of the\nparties from having “a full and fair opportunity to present its case.” (Ibid.)\n       Nor was there any abuse of discretion in the court’s ruling on defendants’ “mass of\nbinders” presented at the end of the trial. As the trial court observed, this avalanche of\n“unreasonable and excessive” material was in direct violation of the court’s prior\n“directives,” consisted primarily of “individuals who were not listed on the trial witness\nlists,” and was consistent with defendants’ pattern of attempts “to skirt the time limits\nimposed by the Court.” And even then the court exercised considerable patience with\ndefendants, sorting through this mass of material and admitting about half of these\ndeposition designations into evidence.\n       Under the circumstances, we can find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\nimposition of time limits, enforcement of those time limits, and rejection of defendants’\nattempt to undermine those limits by sneaking in additional evidence in the form of a\nmassive amount of deposition designations and offers of proof.\n                        4. Lead Paint Rather than Lead Pigments\n       Defendants contend that the trial court deprived them of “fair notice” and a “fair\ntrial” and “violated due process by changing the product at issue after trial” from lead\n“pigments” to lead “paint.”\n\n\n\n\n72\n       This is not a case like In re Marriage of Carlsson (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, in\nwhich the trial judge abused its discretion by abruptly terminating the trial in the midst of a\nparty’s examination of a witness. (Id. at p. 289.)\n                                              113\n\f       Defendants’ contention is frivolous. Since the outset of this case, it has been\nunmistakably clear that the focus of plaintiff’s public nuisance cause of action was lead\npaint. In Santa Clara I, in 2006, this court expressly identified plaintiff’s allegations as\nasserting that defendants “promot[ed] lead paint for interior use even though defendants had\nknown for nearly a century that such a use of lead paint was hazardous to human beings.”\n(Santa Clara I, supra, 137 Cal.App.4th at p. 306, italics added.) The California Supreme\nCourt recognized in Santa Clara II in 2010 that this was an action concerning “lead\npaint . . . .” (Santa Clara II, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 43.) Plaintiff’s opening statement at the\n2013 trial of this action again targeted “lead paint.” Even SWC’s fellow defendant NL\nacknowledged in its opening statement that this action was about “Lead-based paint . . . .”\n       Notwithstanding the fact that it was well recognized years before trial that this case\nwas about lead paint, after plaintiff’s case-in-chief, SWC moved for judgment and argued to\nthe trial court that it was entitled to judgment because “this is a pigment case” rather than a\nlead paint case. SWC claimed that this distinction was important because it could not be\nliable for promotion of lead pigments since it made white lead carbonate pigment only for\nuse in its own paints and did not promote lead pigment to other paint manufacturers.\nSWC’s view was that plaintiff had chosen not to base its case on promotion of lead paint to\nconsumers. Plaintiff responded: “To argue that promoting lead pigment on its own can\nform the basis of liability, but that putting that lead pigment in paint and telling consumers\nto use it specifically in a residence somehow insulates you from public nuisance liability is\njust counterintuitive to the legal principles and to the evidence that’s here in this case.” The\ncourt denied SWC’s motion.\n       SWC’s argument below and on appeal has no merit. SWC and its fellow defendants\nhave always known that this case was about lead paint. Neither plaintiff nor the court\n“chang[ed] the product” in this case. This case was always about lead paint.\n\n\n\n\n                                              114\n\f                                  5. RASSCLE Database\n       Defendants contend that the trial court erroneously “denied defendants a reasonable\nopportunity to obtain and analyze the full RA[S]SCLE database before trial.” They claim\nthat, if they had had full access to the “RASSCLE data” further in advance of trial, that data\n“would have refuted plaintiffs’ outdated, inapposite national studies” on the sources of\nelevated BLLs that the trial court relied upon.\n                                       a. Background\n       “RASSCLE is an acronym for Response and Surveillance System for Childhood\nLead Exposure.” The RASSCLE databases were created by the CLPPB. RASSCLE II is “a\nweb-based system that is available in a number of the counties in the state” and contains\ndata from 2006 and thereafter. RASSCLE I was its predecessor. RASSCLE I was closed in\napproximately 2009.\n       The “RASSCLE database . . . is a collection of the laboratory results of blood lead\nlevel testing results from all of the commercial laboratories in California.” It is not random;\nit simply collects all of the data from children who happen to be tested for lead in\nCalifornia. California regulations require that all children receiving government assistance\nbe tested for lead at age one and age two. State regulations also require that children living\nin pre-1978 housing with deteriorated paint or that has been recently renovated be tested for\nlead. These regulations produce about 700,000 tests each year. However, many of the\nhigh-risk children targeted by RASSCLE for testing do not get tested because testing occurs\nonly if a health provider orders a test. Kaiser members are overrepresented in RASSCLE\nbecause Kaiser makes lead screening a priority. Only about 75 percent of the children\nrequired to be tested are actually tested. The RASSCLE databases contain all cases where a\nchild tested at 10 mcg/dL or higher. Only about 30 percent of the children in the 10\njurisdictions are included in the two RASSCLE databases.\n       The defense conceded that RASSCLE I had been produced by all entities except\nMonterey County. Monterey County was unable to access its RASSCLE I database because\n\n                                             115\n\fit did not know the password. When the court set the trial for July 15, 2013, the RASSCLE\nII database was expected to be produced by the state by June 21, 24 days before the\nbeginning of trial. Defendants claimed that they needed the RASSCLE II data in order to\nsupport their argument that the lead problem had been taken care of because BLLs had\nfallen dramatically. They also claimed that the RASSCLE II data would show that the\ncurrent blood levels were due to other sources besides lead paint. Plaintiffs were willing to\nstipulate that there had been a dramatic drop in BLLs.\n        Defendants received the complete RASSCLE II database on June 21, 2013, three\nweeks before trial. They immediately provided it to their experts. Defendants told the trial\ncourt that their experts estimated that they needed “eight to ten weeks to fully analyze” this\ninformation. They sought a continuance of the trial, but the court denied their request. The\ncourt expressed its belief that the data could be analyzed in a few days and queried: “What\nare they using yellow pads and number 2 pencils? Come on. An abacus.”\n        During its opening statement on July 15, 2013, NL’s trial counsel told the court that\nthe defense was due to receive a report from its experts on the RASSCLE II database on\nJuly 22, 2013. Defense witnesses did not begin testifying until August 15, 2013. A defense\nexpert witness testified on August 15 about his review of the RASSCLE data from 2007\nthrough part of 2012. He testified that he had “go[ne] through the RASSCLE data in\ndetail . . . .”\n                                         b. Analysis\n        While defendants are less than clear about the precise nature of their contention, we\nunderstand them to be arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by denying their\nmotion for a continuance of the trial to permit them more time to analyze the RASSCLE II\n                                                           73\ndata that was provided to them three weeks before trial.        “A trial court has great discretion\n\n\n73\n      Our endeavor is made more difficult by defendants’ failure to cite any authority in\nsupport of this contention other an irrelevant passage in the United States Supreme Court’s\nopinion in Shelby County v.

The trial had not yet begun when the\nexperts received the RASSCLE II data, and the defense claim that analysis of this data\nwould take a minimum of eight weeks was subject to considerable doubt, particularly as the\ndefense had repeatedly sought to delay the trial. In fact, the defense experts were able to\nanalyze the data in less than one month after receiving it, and the defense did not put on any\nwitnesses until nearly two months after its experts received the RASSCLE II data. Under\nthese circumstances, we can find no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s denial of\ndefendants’ continuance motion.\n                                 6. Inspection of Properties\n       Defendants contend that the trial court’s “pre-trial rulings prohibiting discovery”\nviolated due process by “prevent[ing] defendants from mounting a defense to the condition\nof the supposed nuisance properties or to their culpability at each.” They assert that the\ncourt “refused to allow defendants to inspect and exonerate themselves at the claimed\nnuisance properties” and “quashed defendants’ attempt to inspect the alleged nuisance\nproperties and to take discovery of property owners and the Jurisdiction’s decisionmakers.”\n\n\n\ndeclared unconstitutional a section of the federal voting rights act that, in the court’s view,\nselected jurisdictions for “preclearance” “based on 40-year-old facts having no logical\nrelation to the present day.” (Shelby, at p. 2629.) The court concluded that “[i]t would have\nbeen irrational for Congress [in 2006] to distinguish between States in such a fundamental\nway based on 40-year-old data, when today’s statistics tell an entirely different story.”\n(Shelby, at pp. 2630-2631.) The point that defendants may be trying to make is that the\nRASSCLE data would have updated prior studies. Of course this is not true. Because\nRASSCLE data was not compiled in a random fashion and did not even include all of the\ntargeted population, it was not comparable to the data in the studies relied on by plaintiff.\nIn any case, since defendants actually had full access to all of the RASSCLE data in time\nfor their experts to fully analyze it before testifying at trial, defendants could not have been\nprejudiced by the court’s refusal to further delay the trial.\n                                              117\n\f       Less than a month before trial, defendants filed an ex parte motion seeking “to serve\ninspection notices and notice depositions of landlords using the information disclosed in the\nRASSCLE databases, case files, and other documents recently produced or to be produced\nby plaintiffs and the State.” Defendants claimed that their motion should be granted\n“because inspection of those addresses and depositions of landlords is necessary to gain\nevidence on several important topics including (a) whether a paint containing white lead\npigment is even present, as plaintiffs assume to be the case but will not have proved; (b) the\ncondition of any such paint and the reasons therefor including the landlord’s violation of\nCalifornia Health & Safety Code §§ 17920.10 and 17980 et seq., which require property-\nowners to abate ‘lead hazards;’ (c) the cause of any EBLLs [(elevated BLLs)] including\nalternative sources of lead in or around the residence; and (d) the effect of any remediation\non BLLs and the efficacy of remediation.” “This evidence will support defendants’ position\nthat, if there is any continuing problem at all, it is the result of poor maintenance, not mere\npresence.” “Defendants recognize the practical limitations on the number of residences that\ncan be inspected and landlords who can be deposed, especially with the short time between\nproduction of the case files and RASSCLE databases and the current trial date. Although\nthe precise properties that defendants seek to inspect will depend on completing review of\nthe recently, and to-be, produced documents, defendants have identified residences in San\nMateo with lead hazards that it appears were not remediated despite numerous orders from\nthe CLPPP to do so.” One of defendants’ attorneys declared that he had reviewed “case\nfiles produced by plaintiffs,” some of which “identify residences in which it appears that\nlead hazards were not remediated, despite numerous orders from the CLPPP to do so.” The\ncourt denied this ex parte motion.\n       Defendants claim that the court’s “prohibition on discovery” amounted to a denial of\ndue process, but the sole authority that they cite in support of their contention regarding\ninspection of properties is page 958 of the California Supreme Court’s opinion in\nRutherford v.

Rutherford\nwas a strict products liability action seeking damages for harm caused by asbestos. The\nissue before the California Supreme Court was whether it was prejudicial error for the trial\ncourt to give a causation instruction that shifted the burden on causation to the defendants.\nThe court held that the instruction was erroneous but not prejudicial. The page cited by\ndefendants is a portion of the introduction to the opinion. Our best guess is that defendants\nare contending that they should have been permitted to attempt to disprove causation by\nestablishing that the lead paint at particular properties did not come from their products.\n       Yet their actual contention is that the court erred in denying their ex parte motion to\n                                             75\nserve inspection notices on third parties.        “The standard of review for discovery orders is\nabuse of discretion.” (Avant!

Spoliation\n       Defendants claim that they were denied a fair trial because plaintiff’s “spoliation of\nevidence” deprived them of evidence that was “important” to their defense.\n       Defendants identify in their opening brief only two items of “important” evidence\nthat they claim were destroyed by plaintiff. First, they assert that Monterey County\ndestroyed evidence when it changed a statement that had previously appeared on its Web\nsite acknowledging that most cases of elevated BLLs in that county were attributable not to\nlead paint but to other sources. This statement was not destroyed evidence; evidence of the\nremoved statement came in at trial. Second, they assert that San Francisco destroyed\nevidence because it did not retain lead test reports that did not detect a BLL of 5 mcg/dL or\nhigher. Although the lead test reports themselves were “shredded,” the evidence presented\nat trial reflected that the results in those reports were reported to the state and were\ncontained in the state’s records. Hence, no “important” evidence was destroyed.\n       SWC’s reply brief suggests that two other types of evidence were destroyed.\nMonterey County did not retain any prior e-mails that were not in existence in January\n2009, and it was unable to provide access to its RASSCLE I database because the only\nperson who knew the password had died. The defense did not claim that there had been any\n“intentional destruction . . . .” Monterey County’s failure to retain pre-2009 e-mails, while\nunfortunate, does not suggest that any important evidence was destroyed. While the\nRASSCLE I database was inaccessible, Monterey County provided its case files, and\ndefendants had the more recent RASSCLE II database available to them. We see no\nindication that defendants were deprived of important evidence as the result of any\n“spoliation” and thus no basis for their claim that they were thereby deprived of a fair trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                               120\n\f                                     K. Appointment of Receiver\n       Defendants contend that their due process rights were violated because the trial court\nappointed the CLPPB to serve as the receiver of the abatement funds without holding an\nevidentiary hearing and in the absence of evidence that the CLPPB could qualify to serve as\na receiver.\n       “A receiver may be appointed by the court in which an action or proceeding is\npending, or by a judge thereof, . . . [a]fter judgment, to carry the judgment into effect.”\n(Code Civ. Proc., § 564, subd. (b)(3).) “Code of Civil Procedure section 564, subdivision\n(b)(3), gives trial courts the discretion to appoint receivers to carry judgments in abatement\nproceedings into effect.” (City and County of San Francisco v. Daley (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744.) We review a trial court’s order appointing a receiver for abuse of\ndiscretion. (Ibid.)\n       The appointment of a receiver to oversee the disbursement of the abatement funds in\nthis case was necessary. Defendants were required to deposit funds into “a specifically\ndesignated, dedicated, and restricted abatement fund.” The funds in this account would be\n“disbursed” by the receiver only in response to grant applications from the 10\n                 76\njurisdictions.        To perform this function, the trial court ordered that the abatement fund\n                                                                              77\nwould be “administered by” the CLPPB “on behalf of the people . . . .”             While the trial\ncourt’s decision to appoint a receiver in this case was a necessity, not an abuse of discretion,\nwe agree with defendants that the record does not support the court’s selection of the\nCLPPB to serve as the receiver in this case.\n\n\n\n\n76\n       The court provided that the receiver’s costs would be paid out of the abatement fund.\n77\n      The trial court’s order referred to the CLPPB sometimes as the “administrator” of the\nfund and other times as the “receiver” of the fund. Since the parties assume that the CLPPB\nwas appointed to serve as a receiver, we assume the same.\n                                                   121\n\f       Defendants claim that the CLPPB cannot qualify to serve as a receiver because it is a\nnonparty over which the court lacks jurisdiction, has not consented to act as a receiver, and\nis not impartial due to its being a party-affiliated entity.\n       “No party, or attorney of a party, or person interested in an action . . . can be\n                                                                                                78\nappointed receiver therein without the written consent of the parties, filed with the clerk.”\n(Code Civ. Proc., § 566.) “A receiver is an agent and officer of the court, and is under the\ncontrol and supervision of the court. [Citations.] The receiver is also a fiduciary who must\nact for the benefit of all parties interested in the property.” (City of Chula Vista v. Gutierrez\n(2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685.) The receiver must be “neutral.” (Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 3.1179(a).)\n       Since the trial court held no evidentiary hearing regarding the CLPPB’s ability to\nserve as receiver, the record contains no evidence that the CLPPB has consented to serve as\na receiver in this case or that it is sufficiently impartial to be deemed not “interested” in this\naction so that it can serve as a receiver. On remand, we will direct the court to hold an\nevidentiary hearing on the receiver issue.\n\n\n                                       L. SWC’s Cross-Claim\n       SWC maintains that the trial court erred in failing to issue a declaratory judgment in\n                               79\nresponse to its cross-claim.        SWC sought a declaration that “Intact Lead Paint” that is not\na “ ‘lead hazard’ ” under Health and Safety Code sections 17920.10 and 105251 “or in\nviolation of a valid existing ordinance is not a public nuisance.” It also sought a declaration\nthat owners of properties with “lead hazard[s]” are “solely responsible” for the creation and\n\n\n78\n      The court’s abatement order provided that if the CLPPB was “unwilling or unable”\nto administer the fund, the 10 jurisdictions “shall serve in this capacity.” That cannot be.\nThe 10 jurisdictions are not impartial nonparties and therefore cannot serve as receivers.\n(Code of Civ. Proc., § 566.)\n79\n       SWC’s arguments on this issue simply incorporate its other contentions, which we\nhave already rejected.\n                                                  122\n\fmaintenance of “any public nuisance” and the abatement of any “lead hazard.” In sum,\nSWC sought a declaration that intact lead paint could not be declared a public nuisance and\nthat defendants were not responsible for the creation or abatement of lead hazards. The trial\ncourt rejected SWC’s cross-claim.\n       The declaratory judgment that SWC sought was diametrically opposed to the trial\ncourt’s judgment in favor of plaintiff. The trial court’s statement of decision found that\neven intact interior residential lead paint was a public nuisance if it was on friction surfaces.\nThe court also found that defendants were responsible for the creation and abatement of\nlead-paint-based public nuisances in residential housing in the 10 jurisdictions. As we have\nalready determined, these findings are supported by substantial evidence. Because these\nfindings precluded SWC from obtaining its requested declaratory relief, the trial court did\nnot err in rejecting SWC’s cross-claim.\n\n\n                      M. ConAgra’s Liability As Fuller’s Successor\n       ConAgra challenges the trial court’s determination that it was liable as the successor\nto Fuller. It claims that substantial evidence does not support the trial court’s finding.\n       The trial court found that “ConAgra succeeded to Fuller’s liabilities as a result of a\nseries of corporate mergers and/or the express assumption of liabilities.” It ruled that “it is\nfair and appropriate in this case to so hold and necessary to prevent an injustice.”\n       Our substantial evidence standard of review requires us to uphold the trial court’s\nfinding if “ ‘there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will\nsupport the finding of fact.’ ” (Foreman & Clark Corp. v. Fallon, supra, 3 Cal.3d at p. 881.)\n       The ordinary rule for determining “whether a corporation purchasing the principal\nassets of another corporation assumes the other’s liabilities” is “that the purchaser does not\nassume the seller’s liabilities unless (1) there is an express or implied agreement of\nassumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the two\ncorporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere continuation of the seller, or (4) the\n\n                                              123\n\ftransfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the\nseller’s debts.” (Ray v.

This evidence showed that W.P. Fuller\n& Co. (Fuller), a California corporation, merged into Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc.\n(Hunt), a Delaware corporation, in 1962. After Fuller merged into Hunt, “it [(Fuller)] was\nstill the . . . [¶] . . . same operation.” In 1968, three Delaware corporations, including Hunt,\nconsolidated to become Norton Simon, Inc. (Norton Simon). In 1993, Norton Simon\nmerged with another company to become Beatrice Company, which then merged with and\ninto Hunt-Wesson, Inc. (Hunt-Wesson). In 1999, Hunt-Wesson changed its name to\nConAgra. Since all of these transactions were mergers or consolidations, plaintiff’s\nevidence was sufficient to support the court’s finding that ConAgra succeeded to Fuller’s\nliabilities.\n        ConAgra, relying on evidence it presented at trial, claims that the trial court could not\nhave credited plaintiff’s evidence that it succeeded to Fuller’s liabilities. ConAgra’s\nargument disregards the fundamental rule that a trial court may reject even uncontradicted\nevidence so long as it does not do so arbitrarily. (Hicks v. Reis (1943) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1185256\"><a href=\"/opinion/1185256/hicks-v-reis/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659.)\nThe trial court could have reasonably concluded that the evidence upon which ConAgra\nrelies was not credible.\n        ConAgra relies on evidence it produced that, in 1964, a corporation called “W.P.\nFuller Paint Company” was incorporated. ConAgra asserts in its opening brief that “Hunt\nestablished WPFPC as a wholly-owned subsidiary” and cites nine pages of the appendix.\nThose nine pages consist of a “Certificate of Incorporation” for “W.P. Fuller Paint\nCompany.” The certificate contains no apparent reference to Hunt or to “W.P. Fuller Paint\n\n\n\n\n                                              124\n\fCompany” being a subsidiary of Hunt. Hence, this evidence did not establish that “W.P.\n                                                                      80\nFuller Paint Company” was a “wholly-owned subsidiary” of Hunt.\n       ConAgra claims that “undisputed evidence” establishes that all of Fuller’s liabilities\nwere transferred to “W.P. Fuller Paint Company” in 1967. It relies on a document that\npurports to be minutes of a December 1964 “first meeting” of the board of directors of\n“W.P. Fuller Paint Company.” ConAgra asserts in its opening brief that these minutes\n“state WPFPC accepted Fuller’s paint business, including its liabilities.” These purported\nminutes, which were of uncertain origin, state that, at this meeting, the chairman of the\nboard “stated Hunt Foods and Industries, Inc. had offered to transfer certain assets of W. P.\nFuller & Co., a Division of Hunt, subject to certain liabilities, to this Corporation in\nexchange for Four Hundred Thousand (400,000) shares of common stock having a par value\nof $5 each plus certain long and short-term notes.” The purported minutes also state that the\nboard passed a resolution “that this Corporation accept the proposal that Hunt Foods and\nIndustries, Inc., (‘Hunt’) transfer to this Corporation the inventories, rights, credits, good\nwill and other assets, other than certain fixed assets, consisting principally of certain lands,\nbuildings, machinery and equipment which have been mutually agreed upon, of the business\ncarried on by W. P. Fuller & Co., a Division of Hunt, subject to all of its liabilities.”\n                                                                             81\n       ConAgra’s reliance on these purported 1964 minutes is misplaced.           The purported\nminutes, even if credited, would not establish that Hunt transferred “all of” Fuller’s\nliabilities to “W.P. Fuller Paint Company.” At most, these purported minutes might\n\n\n80\n     We note however that plaintiff does not dispute that Hunt created “W.P. Fuller Paint\nCompany.”\n81\n       ConAgra also quotes extensively from an unpublished Delaware trial court opinion,\nThe O’Brien Corp. v. Hunt-Wesson, Inc. (Del. Ch., Feb. 25, 1999, No. CIV. A. 16562) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">126996</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, which dismissed on ripeness grounds a complaint for declaratory relief that\nhad been filed by O’Brien against ConAgra’s predecessor. That action sought a declaration\nthat ConAgra’s predecessor, not O’Brien, was Fuller’s successor. O’Brien’s allegations in\nits complaint in that action relied on the purported 1964 minutes. The Delaware trial court’s\ndismissal of that action, which resolved no factual issues, is of no relevance here.\n                                               125\n\fdemonstrate that Hunt had “offered to transfer certain assets” of Fuller “subject to certain\nliabilities.” The nature of the “certain liabilities” that were purportedly part of Hunt’s offer\nwas not specified. While the purported minutes might show that “W.P. Fuller Paint\nCompany” resolved to accept this offer, the purported minutes do not enumerate all of the\nterms of the Hunt offer, do not demonstrate that any acceptance was communicated to Hunt,\nand do not establish that the two corporations ever actually consummated any contemplated\n                                                                  82\ntransfer of any of Fuller’s assets or liabilities on any terms.        The trial court could have\nreasonably rejected the inferences that ConAgra attempts to draw from the purported\nminutes.\n       ConAgra also claims in its appellate brief that, “[i]n 1967, Hunt sold Fuller’s paint\nbusiness to O’Brien.” ConAgra cites two pages from the appendix. One page is an excerpt\nfrom deposition testimony of a former Fuller employee to the effect that he left Fuller in\n1967 after “Norton Simon announced that he was putting the company up for sale.” Since\nNorton-Simon was not created until 1968, the trial court could have reasonably rejected this\ntestimony. The other page is a 1967 newspaper article reporting that Hunt had announced\nthat it had sold “the business and assets” of “Fuller, a wholly owned subsidiary” to O’Brien.\nThe article states: “Specific details of the transaction weren’t disclosed.” Even if the article\nwere to be deemed credible, it would not establish that Hunt’s purported transaction with\nO’Brien transferred Fuller’s liabilities to O’Brien.\n       Under Ray, the purchaser, here O’Brien, did not assume Fuller’s liabilities “unless\n(1) there is an express or implied agreement of assumption, (2) the transaction amounts to a\nconsolidation or merger of the two corporations, (3) the purchasing corporation is a mere\ncontinuation of the seller, or (4) the transfer of assets to the purchaser is for the fraudulent\n\n\n\n82\n        ConAgra also produced evidence that, in 1967, “W.P. Fuller Paint Company”\nchanged its name to “WPF, Inc.,” and in 1968, “WPF, Inc.” dissolved. We need not address\nthis evidence, as its relevance depends on the validity of the propositions that ConAgra\nstates in its brief but the trial court rejected.\n                                               126\n\fpurpose of escaping liability for the seller’s debts.” (Ray, supra, 19 Cal.3d at p. 28.)\nConAgra produced no evidence of any of the four predicates that could have shown that\nHunt transferred Fuller’s liabilities to O’Brien. ConAgra suggests that the “product line\nexception” to the Ray test applied, but it also failed to provide any evidentiary support for\nthe application of that exception, even if it were the case that this exception could be applied\n                                                                                          83\noutside the strict products liability context in this public nuisance abatement action.        (See\nFranklin v. USX Corp. (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Since plaintiff’s evidence supports the\ncourt’s finding that Fuller’s liabilities flowed from Hunt to Norton-Simon and through it to\nConAgra, we must uphold the court’s finding that ConAgra was Fuller’s successor.\n\n\n                      V. Lead Paint Cases From Other Jurisdictions\n       Defendants repeatedly cite four cases from other jurisdictions in which courts\nrejected public nuisance actions against lead paint and lead pigment manufacturers.\n       City of Chicago v. American Cyanamid Co., supra, 355 Ill.App.3d 209 (Chicago)\n                                                   84\nwas a public nuisance action seeking abatement by Chicago against the manufacturers and\ndistributors of lead pigments and lead paint. (Id. at pp. 210-211.) Chicago appealed after\nthe action was dismissed for failing to state a claim. (Id. at pp. 211-212.) The Appellate\n\n\n83\n        ConAgra’s reliance on SCM Corp. v. Berkel, Inc. (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is\nmisplaced. That declaratory relief action was tried on stipulated facts and joint exhibits.\n(Id. at p. 52.)\n84\n         Chicago’s action originally sought damages, but on appeal Chicago contended only\nthat it should have been able to seek abatement and punitive damages. (Chicago, supra,\n355 Ill.App.3d at pp. 211-212.)\n                                                127\n\fCourt of Illinois upheld the dismissal on the ground that Chicago had failed to adequately\nallege “proximate cause” because Chicago could not identify any specific defendant as the\nsource of the lead pigment or lead paint at any particular location. (Id. at p. 216.) The court\nrejected Chicago’s contention that the defendants were liable under a “market share” or\n“collective liability” theory. It held that Illinois did not recognize either theory. (Id. at\npp. 217-218.) In addition, the court held that Chicago could not succeed because it had\nfailed to allege that the defendants controlled the property where the alleged nuisance was\nlocated. (Id. at p. 221.)\n       City of St. Louis v. Benjamin Moore & Co. (Mo. 2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2165775\"><a href=\"/opinion/2165775/city-of-st-louis-v-benjamin-moore-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (St. Louis)\nwas a public nuisance action brought by a city against lead paint distributors seeking to\nrecover “damages for assessing, abating, and remediating the nuisance.” (Id. at pp. 113,\n116 [“private tort action” seeking “damages”].) The trial court granted summary judgment\nto the defendants on the ground that the city could not prove causation without\nidentification of the lead manufacturer whose paint had been remediated. (Id. at p. 113.)\nThe Supreme Court of Missouri, relying on a case in which it had held that “market-share\nliability” was contrary to Missouri law, held that “actual causation can be established only\nby identifying the defendant who made or sold that product.” (Id. at p. 115.)\n       In re Lead Paint Litigation, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1924340\"><a href=\"/opinion/1924340/in-re-lead-paint-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1924340\"><a href=\"/opinion/1924340/in-re-lead-paint-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">] (New Jersey) was a\nSupreme Court of New Jersey decision in a case where the trial court had dismissed for\nfailure to state a cause of action a “common law” public nuisance action brought by\nmunicipalities against lead paint manufacturers. (Id. at p. 409.) The Supreme Court of New\nJersey noted that the New Jersey Legislature had declared interior residential lead paint to\nbe a public nuisance and assigned responsibility for it to the owners of the residences, not\npaint manufacturers. (Id. at pp. 429, 432-433.) Relying on the Restatement, the court found\nthat only a tortfeasor “in control of the nuisance” could be held liable for public nuisance,\nand the paint manufacturers lacked such control. (New Jersey, at pp. 425, 429, 433.) The\ncourt also held that the action was barred because the municipalities sought damages, rather\n\n                                               128\n\fthan abatement, and damages were not available in a public nuisance action to a public\nentity plaintiff that had suffered no special injury. (Id. at pp. 435-436.) Finally, the court\nheld that, because the complaint sought to premise liability on a failure to warn, it\n“sound[ed] in products liability” and could not be the basis for a public nuisance action.\n(Id. at pp. 437-439.)\n       State v. Lead Industries Ass’n, Inc., supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Rhode Island) was a\nSupreme Court of Rhode Island decision in a public nuisance action brought by the state in\nwhich a trial court had ordered three former lead pigment manufacturers to abate lead paint.\nThe court held that the trial court should have dismissed the action for failing to state a\ncause of action. (Id. at p. 452.) It found lacking any allegation that the defendants had\ninterfered with a public right and any allegation that the defendants controlled the lead\npigment. (Id. at p. 453.) “The interference must deprive all members of the community of a\nright to some resource to which they otherwise are entitled. [Citation] The Restatement\n(Second) provides much guidance in ascertaining the fine distinction between a public right\nand an aggregation of private rights. ‘Conduct does not become a public nuisance merely\nbecause it interferes with the use and enjoyment of land by a large number of persons.’ ”\n(Id. at p. 453.) “[A] public right is a right of the public to shared resources such as air,\nwater, or public rights of way.” (Id. at p. 455.) The court also held, in reliance on New\nJersey, that the complaint was inadequate because it had failed to “allege any facts that\nwould support a conclusion that defendants were in control of the lead pigment at the time it\nharmed Rhode Island’s children.” (Rhode Island, at p. 455.)\n       These cases are readily distinguishable from the case before us. None of the courts\nin these other jurisdictions assessed the merits of a public nuisance action in light of the\nvoluminous evidence that was presented at the trial in this case. Only the Rhode Island case\nhad been tried, and the Supreme Court of Rhode Island considered only the pleadings. The\nChicago and New Jersey cases were dismissed at the pleading stage, and the St. Louis case\nwas dismissed on summary judgment. The evidence presented at the trial in this case\n\n                                               129\n\fproved the elements of a representative public nuisance action, which might not have been\napparent from the pleadings in the actions in these other jurisdictions. Only the Rhode\nIsland and Chicago cases were actions for abatement rather than damages. As we have\npointed out repeatedly, a representative public nuisance action seeking only remedial\nabatement is legally distinct from an action for damages.\n        None of the reasons that the courts in these other jurisdictions provided for their\nrejection of public nuisance liability applies to the case before us. The Chicago court relied\non “lack of control” and a restrictive Illinois causation definition. As this court pointed out\nin Santa Clara I, a defendant’s control of the nuisance is not necessary to establish liability\nin a representative public nuisance action in California. (Santa Clara I, supra, 137\nCal.App.4th at p. 306.) The Illinois causation test is not analogous to California’s\nsubstantial factor test. St. Louis is similarly distinguishable because the court based its\nanalysis on a Missouri causation test that is not analogous to California’s substantial factor\ntest.\n        The New Jersey court’s analysis was based on lack of control, specific New Jersey\nlaws assigning responsibility solely to property owners, and its conclusion that the action,\nwhich was for damages, “sound[ed]” in products liability rather than nuisance. Control is\nnot required in California for a public nuisance action (Santa Clara I, supra, 137\nCal.App.4th at p. 306), and California’s laws do not assign exclusive responsibility for lead\npaint remediation to property owners. This court held in Santa Clara I that a representative\npublic nuisance action is not a disguised products liability action. “A public nuisance cause\nof action is not premised on a defect in a product or a failure to warn but on affirmative\nconduct that assisted in the creation of a hazardous condition. Here, the alleged basis for\ndefendants’ liability for the public nuisance created by lead paint is their affirmative\npromotion of lead paint for interior use, not their mere manufacture and distribution of lead\npaint or their failure to warn of its hazards. [¶] In contrast, a products liability action may\nbe brought only by one who has already suffered a physical injury to his or her person or\n\n                                              130\n\fproperty, and the plaintiff in a products liability action is limited to recovering damages for\nsuch physical injuries.” (Santa Clara I, at pp. 309-310.)\n       The Rhode Island court’s decision was based on lack of control (which does not\napply in California) and lack of interference with a public right. We disagree with the\nRhode Island court’s conclusion that lead paint does not interfere with “shared resources”\n(see section IV(B) of this opinion), and the Rhode Island court’s Restatement-based analysis\nof the “public right” is not consistent with California’s broader statutory definition of a\npublic nuisance. (Rhode Island, supra, 951 A.2d at pp. 453, 455.)\n       We therefore reject defendants’ reliance on these cases from other jurisdictions.\n\n\n                                    VI. Amici Arguments\n       Seven amicus briefs have been filed in this case. Amici Civil Justice Association\n(CJA), Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF), and NFIB Small Business Center et al. (NFIB) have\nfiled amicus briefs in support of defendants. Amici American Academy of Pediatrics,\nCalifornia (AAPCA), the Environmental Health Coalition and the Healthy Homes\nCollaborative (EHC), California Conference of Local Health Officers (CCLHO), and a\n                                                                                              85\ngroup of organizations including Changelab, Consumer Attorneys of California and others\n(Changelab) have filed amicus briefs in support of plaintiff.\n\n\n                                           A. CJA\n       CJA contends that we should reject the trial court’s judgment holding lead paint\nmanufacturers liable for creating a public nuisance because courts in other states have\nrejected such actions and certain journal articles have criticized the extension of public\nnuisance liability to such cases. California law is not based on the rulings of courts in other\n\n\n\n85\n      The others are Equal Justice Society, National Center for Healthy Housing,\nPrevention Institute, and Public Health Institute.\n                                              131\n\fstates, which are based on their laws and the facts of their cases, nor would be it appropriate\nfor us to reverse a judgment based on opinions expressed in journal articles. The trial court\nproperly applied California law, and, with one exception, substantial evidence supports its\nabatement order.\n       CJA contends that this case should have been dismissed because it sought resolution\nof a “non-justiciable political question,” but none of the cases it cites is remotely similar to\nthe one before us. CJA’s argument largely repeats the separation of powers arguments\nmade by defendants, which we have already rejected in section IV(C) of this opinion.\n       CJA challenges the trial court’s conclusion that a “public right” was at issue here.\nWe have already addressed that issue in section IV(B) of this opinion. CJA also challenges\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court’s causation finding and claims that\nthe substantial factor test for causation does not properly encompass the cause-in-fact\nrequirement. The substantial factor test is the law in California. We have already fully\naddressed the causation issue in section IV(A)(4) of this opinion.\n\n\n                                            B. PLF\n       PLF’s brief argues that application of public nuisance law in this case violates due\nprocess and is against public policy. The premise for PLF’s due process contention is its\nclaim that defendants’ conduct “was lawful and non-tortious at the time the Defendants\nengaged in it . . . .” This misunderstanding of the basis for the trial court’s judgment\npermeates PLF’s brief, which makes a frontal assault on the constitutionality of California’s\npublic nuisance law. We reject PLF’s unfounded assertions. Defendants were found liable\nbecause they promoted lead paint for interior residential use knowing that such use would\npose a serious risk of harm to children. This conduct was just as unlawful and tortious\nwhen they engaged in it as it is now because the creation of a public nuisance has been\n\n\n\n\n                                              132\n\funlawful in California since the 1800s. Consequently, the due process problem that PLF\n                                         86\nperceives does not exist in this case.\n       PLF fails to support its claim that the federal constitutional prohibition against\nvagueness in criminal statutes applies to civil liability for creating a public nuisance. PLF\nasserts: “Although most cases involving the ‘constitutional requirement of definiteness,’\n[citation to criminal case], have dealt with criminal statutes, the requirement also applies to\nnuisance law.” PLF goes on to cite as an “example” a criminal case in which a protester\nwas convicted of violating a noise ordinance. PLF then states that “[t]hese principles also\napply to civil laws.” It proceeds to cite cases involving challenges to statutes that prohibited\nspeech. PLF identifies no civil case not involving the suppression of speech in which a\ncourt found that a public nuisance abatement action could not be brought because the statute\nbarring public nuisances was unconstitutionally vague. We reject PLF’s due process\nargument as unfounded.\n       PLF claims that the trial court could not have found “unreasonableness” because it\n“declar[ed] a lawfully sold product to be a public nuisance.” PLF continues to misconstrue\nthe basis for the trial court’s decision. The trial court found that defendants were liable for\ncreating a public nuisance as a result of their conduct in promoting lead paint for interior\nresidential use while knowing of the hazard that such use would create. The court did not\nfind that lead paint itself was a public nuisance. As this court ruled in Santa Clara I, such\nconduct is unreasonable under the statutory definition of a public nuisance.\n       PLF argues that the trial court’s judgment “impermissibly broadens the definition of\n‘public right’ ” by applying it to injuries caused by “products . . . bought and used by\nindividuals . . . .” Once again, PLF misconstrues the trial court’s judgment. No individual\ninjuries are being redressed. The trial court’s judgment requires only that defendants\n\n\n\n86\n      PLF also contends that the trial court’s judgment violates separation of powers, a\ncontention that we have already analyzed in section IV(C) of this opinion.\n                                              133\n\fremediate the dangerous conditions they created in the housing stock in these 10\njurisdictions. PLF also attacks the trial court’s finding of causation, but its argument\nignores the evidence that we have already concluded, with one exception, supports the trial\ncourt’s causation finding.\n       PLF contends that the judgment improperly affects the rights of individual property\nowners without notice. It does not. The abatement plan ordered by the trial court is\npremised on voluntary participation by property owners. No property owners will be forced\nto participate, and therefore their rights will not be involuntarily impacted. While it is true\nthat the abatement plan contemplates that the 10 jurisdictions will make publicly available a\nlist of properties that have not been enrolled in the abatement plan, this provision alone does\nnot substantially impact the rights of individual property owners. Already, any property\nbuilt before 1978 is presumed to contain lead paint. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17, § 35043.)\nThat presumption eliminates any impact on a property owner from a publicly available list\nof only those presumptively lead-paint-containing properties that have not been enrolled in\nthe abatement plan. Property owners can only gain from enrollment in the plan; they have\nnothing to lose. PLF insists that the court’s abatement order has “declared a nuisance” on\nindividual properties without notice to the property owners. Not so. The trial court ordered\ndefendants to abate the public nuisance they had created, but it did not identify any specific\nproperties. The abatement plan itself is designed to identify and remediate the individual\nproperties upon which defendants’ public nuisance exists.\n       PLF maintains that public policy and a “national trend” favor rejection of the\napplication of public nuisance in this case. It relies in part on out-of-state cases that have\nrejected public nuisance liability in lead paint cases. Those cases did not apply California\npublic nuisance law, so they are inapposite. PLF’s reliance on Firearm Cases is no more\nhelpful to its cause. In that case, the First District Court of Appeal found causation\n\n\n\n\n                                              134\n\f           87\nlacking.        “Merely engaging in what plaintiffs deem to be a risky practice, without a\nconnecting causative link to a threatened harm, is not a public nuisance.” (Firearm Cases,\nsupra, 126 Cal.App.4th at p. 988.) “In this case, there is no causal connection between any\nconduct of the defendants and any incident of illegal acquisition of firearms or criminal acts\nor accidental injury by a firearm.” (Id. at p. 989.) Here, unlike in the First District’s case,\ndefendants did not merely sell a product that posed a risk of harm. Defendants promoted\nlead paint for interior residential use knowing that such use would create a serious risk of\nharm to children. As we have already determined, substantial evidence supports the trial\ncourt’s decision that, with one exception, plaintiff established causation.\n       PLF argues that public policy weighs against recognizing a public nuisance cause of\naction in this case. “[I]f the lawful sale of a legal product can later serve as the basis of\npublic nuisance liability of unlimited severity, businesses will be less willing to participate\nin the California market, or to provide citizens with products that might later prove\nhazardous or simply unpopular.” This argument is divorced from the facts of this case.\nWhen a manufacturer promotes a product for a specific use that it knows will create a\nhazardous condition, public policy supports the use of California public nuisance law to\nrequire the manufacturer to remediate the hazards created by its conduct.\n\n\n                                              C. NFIB\n       NFIB argues that the trial court failed to require plaintiff to establish that defendants\nacted with the requisite knowledge and that defendants’ conduct caused the public nuisance.\nWe have already addressed these issues in response to defendants’ contentions. NFIB also\nrepeats some of the same arguments that PLF makes, which we have already rejected.\nNFIB argues that courts have previously rejected large-scale public nuisance actions, but it\n\n\n\n87\n       PLF repeatedly identifies that case as being from “this Court.” It is not from this\ncourt, but from the First District.\n                                                 135\n\foffers no detailed analysis of the reasons why those cases failed. It also notes that prior\npublic nuisance actions in other states against lead paint manufacturers have failed. NFIB’s\nmain argument seems to be that courts should not allow public nuisance causes of action to\nbe based on products, and it explicitly urges this court to “reconsider” Santa Clara I. We\ndecline to do so for the reasons expressed in Santa Clara I.\n\n\n                               D. Amici Supporting Plaintiff\n       Changelab argues that public nuisance abatement orders like the trial court’s decision\nare urgently needed due to the lack of resources to combat the “epidemic” of lead poisoning\narising from lead paint in residential housing. AAPCA emphasizes the need for “primary\nprevention” to ensure safe housing for children to avoid the “potentially devastating effects”\nof childhood lead poisoning, including irreversible cognitive impairment and developmental\nproblems. It notes that remediation of housing containing lead paint is “the most critical\nstep” in primary prevention. CCLHO echoes these concerns and points out the burden on\ngovernmental resources created by childhood lead poisoning, which disproportionately\nimpacts economically disadvantaged children. EHC observes that a large portion of the\nhousing stock continues to contain deteriorating lead paint that poses a serious health risk to\nchildren. EHC expresses substantial concern about the fact that the children most at risk,\nthe poor, who live in the oldest, most deteriorated housing, are those with the least access to\nhealthcare and are therefore those who are the least likely to be tested for lead and treated\nfor lead poisoning.\n       All of the concerns expressed by the amici in support of plaintiff support the trial\ncourt’s decision to order remedial abatement as an equitable remedy for defendants’\nknowing creation of a public nuisance.\n\n\n\n\n                                              136\n\f                                      VII. Disposition\n       The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court with\ndirections to (1) recalculate the amount of the abatement fund to limit it to the amount\nnecessary to cover the cost of remediating pre-1951 homes, and (2) hold an evidentiary\nhearing regarding the appointment of a suitable receiver. Plaintiff shall recover its costs on\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                             137\n\f                                _______________________________\n                                Mihara, J.\n\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_____________________________\nPremo, Acting P.
