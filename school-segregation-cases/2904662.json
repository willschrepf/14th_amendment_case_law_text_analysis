The\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. See Roubideaux\nv. N. D. Dep't of Corr. & Rehab., 523 F. Supp. 2d 952 (D.N.D. 2007). We affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       The undisputed facts indicate that since 1997, female inmates in the custody of\nthe North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (\"DOCR\") have been\nhoused in four separate prison facilities: the North Dakota State Penitentiary\n(\"NDSP\"); the Missouri River Correctional Center (\"Missouri River CC\"), also known\nas the farm; the James River Correctional Center (\"James River CC\"); and the Dakota\nWomen's Correction and Rehabilitation Center (\"Dakota Women's CRC\"), a facility\noperated by the Southwest-Multi-County Correctional Center (\"SWMCCC\") under\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcontract with the DOCR.1 Prior to June 1998, the Female Inmates were all housed\nwith the male inmates either at the NDSP, which has approximately 550 beds, 60 of\nwhich were occupied by women, or at the smaller Missouri River CC, which has\napproximately 150 beds and housed 14 women. These facilities are both located in\nNorth Dakota's capital city of Bismarck. In June 1998, the James River CC opened\nin Jamestown, North Dakota, and all of the female inmates who had been housed at\nthe NDSP were transferred there. The James River CC houses around 374 inmates.\n\n        In 2003, the DOCR contracted with SWMCCC to house all of the female\ninmates together. SWMCCC is a partnership of six counties created pursuant to a\njoint powers agreement. SWMCCC established and operates two correctional\nfacilities. It renovated a Catholic boarding school in New England, North Dakota\n(population 527), into the Dakota Women's CRC, a 110-bed women-only correctional\nfacility. SWMCCC also operates a separate facility, the Dickinson jail. The Dakota\nWomen's CRC operates pursuant to SWMCCC's contract with the DOCR. Transfer\nof all women inmates to the Dakota Women's CRC began in 2003 and was completed\nby August of 2004.\n\n       The Female Inmates filed this lawsuit in 2003 against the DOCR, Elaine Little,\nPrison Director Timothy Schuetzle, and James River CC Warden Don Redmann\n(collectively \"the State Defendants\"), as well as SWMCCC, alleging discriminatory\nconditions in the facilities and programs offered to women inmates in DOCR\ninstitutions in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. At that time, the\nFemale Inmates were still housed at the Missouri River CC and the James River CC\nwith the male inmates, but their transfer to the Dakota Women's CRC was imminent.\n\n      1\n       Some women inmates are also housed at the Tompkins Rehabilitation Center\nin Jamestown and in transitional living centers in Fargo and Bismarck, but there are\nno allegations of unequal conditions or programming at these facilities. See\nRoubideaux, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 955 n.3.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fThe complaint alleged that the Female Inmates suffered discrimination on the basis\nof sex because the State Defendants provided unequal and inferior programs,\neducation, and services in comparison with those offered to the male inmates, and that,\n\"unless enjoined, defendants will transfer female inmates to county jails providing\nunequal and inferior facilities and programs in comparison to male inmates.\" (J.A. at\n24.) The complaint listed two gender-based North Dakota statutes that the Female\nInmates asserted authorized the DOCR to house female inmates in county facilities\nfor more than one year. See N.D.C.C. § 12-47-38 (Supp. 2007); N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-\n06.2 (2003) (expired).2 The district court certified the class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, finding that the plaintiffs requested primarily\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n       After all of the women had been transferred to the Dakota Women's CRC, the\nState Defendants and SWMCCC sought summary judgment on the ground that the\nFemale Inmates could no longer demonstrate that they were similarly situated to the\nmale inmates, a necessary element of the equal protection analysis. See Keevan v.\nSmith, 100 F.3d 644, 648 (8th Cir. 1996) (concluding male and female inmates at\ndifferent institutions in Missouri were not similarly situated based upon a comparison\nof a number of factors that made such a comparison unworkable); Klinger v. Dep't of\nCorr., 31 F.3d 727, 733 & n.4 (8th Cir. 1994) (Klinger I) (same in Nebraska), cert.\ndenied, 513 U.S. 1185 (1995). They also argued that the Female Inmates were not\nentitled to relief under Title IX because they failed to show discrimination in a\nprogram or activity within the meaning of Title IX.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Section 12-44.1-06.2 was enacted in 2003 and expired on June 30, 2005; it was\nreplaced with an identical provision, which expired in 2007. See N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-\n06.3 (2005) (expired June 30, 2007). Currently, a gender-neutral version exists in\n§ 12-44.1-06(3), but the gender-specific version of 2003 was in effect at the time the\nFemale Inmates were transferred to Dakota Women's CRC.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f       In response, the Female Inmates asserted that they were not attempting to\ncompare the programming decisions made at different institutions within the system,\nas did the inmates in Klinger I and Keevan. Instead, they claimed to be challenging\nthe gender-based \"policy, based on statute, of removing female inmates from the\ncustody of the [DOCR] . . . and sending them to the custody of local county jails\nwhere they are unable to take advantage of the programs and services offered by the\n[DOCR].\" (J.A. at 203.) Thus, they transformed the issue into a facial statutory\nchallenge, alleging that the gender-based classification in the statute resulted in a\ndiscriminatory decisionmaking process. They also continued to assert that inequalities\nin the prison industries program and vocational education programs offered to them\nviolated Title IX.\n\n       The district court permitted the Female Inmates to shift the focus of their equal\nprotection claim to the challenged statutes but granted summary judgment to the State\nDefendants and SWMCCC. The district court concluded that the Female Inmates\nlacked standing to challenge statutes that did not apply to them and that they had\nexpressly abandoned all equal protection claims aside from the statutory challenge.\nAlternatively, the district court concluded that the Female Inmates had failed to\ndemonstrate an intent to discriminate on the basis of gender. As to the Title IX claims,\nthe district court concluded that the prison industries program is not an education\nprogram within the meaning of Title IX and that the vocational training offered at the\nDakota Women's CRC was not shown to be inferior. The Female Inmates appeal.\n\n                                          II.\n\n       We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, \"viewing all evidence and\nreasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Habhab\nv. Hon, 536 F.3d 963, 966 (8th Cir. 2008). Summary judgment is proper where there\nis no genuine dispute of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fa matter of law. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n322-23 (1986).\n\n                                  A. Equal Protection\n                                     1. Standing\n\n       Article III of the United States Constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to\njusticiable cases and controversies. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n559-60 (1992); Mosby v. Ligon, 418 F.3d 927, 933 (8th Cir. 2005). When\nchallenging a statute, the plaintiff must show \"an injury to [her]self that is likely to be\nredressed by a favorable decision\" and that is \"fairly traceable to the challenged\nstatute.\" Women's Health Ctr. of W. County, Inc. v. Webster, 871 F.2d 1377, 1383-84\n(8th Cir. 1989) (internal marks omitted). The district court concluded that the Female\nInmates lacked Article III standing to challenge the two statutes as gender based\nbecause they were transferred to the Dakota Women's CRC, which the district court\nconcluded was not a \"county jail\" or \"regional corrections center\" within the meaning\nof the statutes.\n\n       \"Statutory interpretation is a question of law.\" Minn. Supply Co. v. Raymond\nCorp., 472 F.3d 524, 537 (8th Cir. 2006); Bolinske v. Jaeger, 756 N.W.2d 336, 339\n(N.D. 2008). We are bound by North Dakota's rules of statutory interpretation in\nreviewing a North Dakota statute. See, generally, Fargo Women's Health Org. v.\nSchafer, 18 F.3d 526, 530-31 (1994) (applying North Dakota principles of statutory\ninterpretation in considering the constitutionality of a North Dakota law). Under\nNorth Dakota's rules, our \"primary objective in interpreting a statute is to ascertain\nlegislative intent.\" N.D. State Elec. Bd. v. Boren, 756 N.W.2d 784, 786 (N.D. 2008).\n\"To ascertain legislative intent, we initially look to the statute's language, giving the\nstatute's words their plain, ordinary, and commonly understood meaning.\" Id. We\nconstrue statutes as a whole and, where possible, harmonize the language used to give\nmeaning to each word and phrase. Id. \"[I]f the language is clear and unambiguous,\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fwe presume the legislative intent is clear from the face of the statute.\" Von Ruden v.\nN.D. Workforce Safety & Ins. Fund, 755 N.W.2d 885, 890 (N.D. 2008).\n\n       In support of their argument that they have standing to challenge the\nconstitutionality of the two gender-explicit statutes that allegedly facilitated their\ntransfer to the Dakota Women's CRC, the Female Inmates assert that the Dakota\nWomen's CRC is both a \"county jail\" and a \"regional corrections center\" within the\nmeaning of the statutes. Although some of the statutory definitions overlap (for\ninstance, a \"jail\" is defined as a \"correctional facility\" and a \"correctional facility\" is\ndefined, in part, as a \"jail\"), see N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-01, we believe the statutory\nlanguage is clear and unambiguous. We consider each statute in turn.\n\n       The first challenged statute articulates the DOCR's contracting authority with\nregard to counties. It provides that, if there is no space in a qualified state facility, the\nDOCR must contract to house female inmates in a county jail that has the available\nspace, the ability to segregate male and female inmates, and the ability to provide the\nnecessary services and programs stated in the statute. See N.D.C.C. § 12-47-38.3 The\nterm \"county jail\" is not specifically defined by the statute. Its plain language\nindicates that it is a jail operated by a county. A jail is defined as \"a correctional\nfacility, including a county or city jail or a regional corrections center.\" N.D.C.C.\n§ 12-44.1-01(5). A \"regional corrections center\" is at once both a \"correctional\n\n\n       3\n        Section 12-47-38 provides in full as follows:\n       If there is no qualified state facility available, the director of the [DOCR]\n       shall contract with a county for the housing of female inmates in the\n       county jail, to the extent space is available in the county jail. The county\n       jail must be designed in a manner that can adequately segregate the\n       female inmates from the male inmates. Any county with which the\n       department contracts must have available and must provide the female\n       inmates access to educational and vocational programs, chemical\n       dependency treatment programs, mental health programs, medical\n       services, and adequate recreational facilities.\n\n                                            -7-\n\ffacility\" and a \"jail\" that is owned by several counties or cities. See N.D.C.C. § 12-\n44.1-01(7) (defining a \"regional corrections center\" as \"a correctional facility\nestablished and maintained by more than one county or city . . . for the confinement\nof inmates\"). Because the term \"county jail\" is not used as a defined term of art, it\nnecessarily includes the whole definition of \"jail\" modified only by the term \"county.\"\nThe fact that \"county jail\" is used in the singular is insignificant because words used\nin the singular in the North Dakota Century Code are meant to include the plural,\nexcept where a plainly contrary intention applies. See N.D.C.C. § 1-01-35.\nTherefore, because the Dakota Women's CRC is a \"correctional facility\" that is owned\nby several counties (SWMCCC), it is within the scope of a \"county jail\" under this\nstatute. And, while this statute sets forth particular restrictions on the DOCR's\ncontracting authority and lists services that must be available at the county facility, it\ndoes not articulate any requirement that a county jail or regional corrections center\nmust have operated as such prior to entering a contract with the DOCR.4\n\n         The second challenged statute works with the first by expanding the length of\ntime that a county correctional facility can house female inmates under a DOCR\ncontract. It authorized the DOCR to contract with SWMCCC to house female inmates\nfor more than one year with specified services. In North Dakota, correctional facilities\noperated by a county are subject to inspection by the DOCR and a grading system.\nA grade one classification is the highest classification permitted; it denotes that the\nDOCR has determined, based upon the facility's \"construction, size and usage,\" that\nit is fit to confine inmates for not more than one year. N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-06(1)(a).\n\n\n\n\n      4\n        The State Defendants and SWMCCC argue that the Dakota Women's CRC is\na \"state contract facility,\" but because this phrase is not statutorily defined or\notherwise statutorily significant, it is merely descriptive. As such, a \"state contract\nfacility\" implies nothing more than that the facility now houses inmates pursuant to\nthe terms of a contract with the state.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fThe challenged statute, § 12-44.1-06.2 (2003),5 permits the county correctional facility\nto house female inmates for longer than one year by a contract with the DOCR, when\notherwise, a county correctional facility, even with the highest classification, would\nhave been limited to housing inmates for one year. Because of this statute, the DOCR\ncontract with SWMCCC validly authorized the Dakota Women's CRC to house the\nFemale Inmates for more than one year. Absent the challenged statute, the Dakota\nWomen's CRC would otherwise have been limited by statute to housing female\ninmates for one year at most. Both of the challenged statutes, then, worked together\nto permit the DOCR and SWMCCC to enter into the contract by which the Female\nInmates were transferred to, and are currently housed at, the Dakota Women's CRC\nfor more than one year. Accordingly, the Female Inmates have standing to challenge\nthe statutes.\n\n                      2. Merits of the Equal Protection Claim\n\n       \"The Equal Protection Clause generally requires the government to treat\nsimilarly situated people alike.\" Klinger I, 31 F.3d at 731 (citing City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985)). \"The similarly situated inquiry\nfocuses on whether the plaintiffs are similarly situated to another group for purposes\nof the challenged government action,\" and so it is necessary to \"precisely define\" the\nclaim in order to determine what government action is being challenged. Id. The\nFemale Inmates assert that the gender-based classification on the face of the\nchallenged statutes resulted in a discriminatory process, and we have noted that male\nand female inmates are similarly situated at the beginning of the decisionmaking\n\n\n      5\n       Section 12-44.1-06.2 (2003), which has since expired, provided:\n      Notwithstanding section 12-44.1-06, a grade one correctional facility that\n      has a contract with the [DOCR] to confine female inmates who have\n      been sentenced to the legal and physical custody of the [DOCR] may\n      confine the female inmate for more than one year in accordance with the\n      terms of the contract. . . .\n\n                                          -9-\n\fprocess regarding prison programming. Id. at 733 n.4 (noting that a comparison of the\nprocess by which programming decisions are made is an example of a proper equal\nprotection comparison of a prison's treatment of male and female inmates).\n\n       The challenged statutes apply to the DOCR's decisionmaking process of\ndetermining where to house female inmates, and the statutes include a gender-based\nclassification on their face. See N.D.C.C. §§ 12-47-38, 12-44.1-06.2. When a statute\nemploys a gender-based classification, we apply a heightened review standard. See\nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532-33 (1996). \"[T]he state must\npersuasively show that certain gender-based classifications serve 'important\ngovernmental objectives' and that the statute in question is 'substantially related to the\nachievement of those objectives.'\" Ways v. City of Lincoln, 331 F.3d 596, 600 (8th\nCir. 2003) (quoting Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533); see also Keevan, 100 F.3d at 650. This\nheightened standard, however, does not completely proscribe gender-based\nclassifications because the physical differences between males and females are real.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. at 533. While gender classifications may never be used \"to create\nor perpetuate [a] legal, social, and economic inferiority of women,\" id. at 534, we are\nmindful that this claim arises in a prison housing context where the program\ndifferences may result from the housing decision and that it is appropriate to segregate\nmale and female inmates on the basis of gender, see Klinger v. Dep't of Corr., 107\nF.3d 609, 615 (8th Cir. 1997) (\"Klinger II\"). \"[C]ourts are ill equipped to deal with\nthe increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform,\" and the\ndifficult job of running a prison system requires \"expertise, planning, and the\ncommitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the\nlegislative and executive branches of government.\" Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84,\n85 (1987) (internal marks omitted). The Female Inmates do not challenge the DOCR's\ngeneral policy of segregating male and female inmates by gender. Instead, they assert\nthat the gender-based classification contained in the challenged statutes resulted in a\ndiscriminatory decisionmaking process that worked to exclude them from any DOCR\nprograms.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f       After a careful review, we conclude that the undisputed evidence in the record\nraises no inference of discrimination in the decisionmaking process because the\nstatutes substantially relate to the important governmental objective of providing\nadequate segregated housing for women inmates. The undisputed evidence\ndemonstrates that the DOCR female population as a whole is much smaller than the\nmale population, that sufficient space to house the women in DOCR institutions was\nbecoming an issue as the entire prison population increased, and that, for the many\nreasons set forth in the complaint and throughout the record, female inmates were in\nneed of a separate facility to better meet their needs. Transferring the same number\nof male inmates instead of the women would not have resolved these issues for the\nfemale inmates. The statutes are substantially related to this important objective in\nthat they expressly require the DOCR to contract with county facilities that have\nadequate extra space for the female inmates, but only when there is no qualified state\nfacility available and only when the county facility is able to provide segregation from\nmale inmates and an appropriate level of services and programs for the female\ninmates. If those conditions are met, the county facility is authorized to house the\nfemale inmates for more than one year. The statutes substantially further the\ngovernment's legitimate and important objective of segregating women inmates from\nmale inmates while providing them with the same type of services that are available\nwithin the DOCR system. There is no evidence to suggest that any resulting\ndifferences in programming from this permissible segregation are caused by gender\ndiscrimination.\n\n      The Female Inmates argue that the decision to house them at the Dakota\nWomen's CRC was based on economic concerns born out of a desire to benefit\nwestern North Dakota economically rather than out of a concern for what was in their\nbest interests. Even assuming this is true, it does not raise an inference of\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender. The gender-based statutory scheme at issue is\nnot impermissibly discriminatory.\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f       The Female Inmates also attempt to make an as-applied challenge to the\nstatutes, asserting that they are, in fact, being denied the opportunity to participate in\nany programs operated in the DOCR system and that they are provided programs that\nare inferior to those offered within the DOCR institutions, even though the contract\nbetween the SWMCCC and the DOCR states an express intent to provide programs\nand services to the female inmates \"in parity\" with those provided to the male inmates\nhoused in the DOCR institutions. (J.A. at 138.) We agree with the district court,\nhowever, that the Female Inmates expressly abandoned this argument by their express\nassertion that they were \"not challenging the programming decisions made by the\nDOCR as to what programs should be offered at which facilities.\" Roubideaux, 523\nF. Supp. 2d at 964 (internal marks omitted). They voluntarily and consciously shifted\nthe focus of their argument to the decisionmaking process dictated by the gender-\nexplicit statutes. The type of equal protection argument they now couch as an as-\napplied challenge to the statutes moves beyond the initial decisionmaking process,\nwhere we found the male and female inmates to be similarly situated, and seeks to\nreturn to the type of program comparisons between institutions that we have held to\nbe unworkable and that the Female Inmates expressly abandoned. See Keevan, 100\nF.3d at 649-50 (holding that male and female inmates at different institutions in\nMissouri were not similarly situated with regard to challenging the assignment of\nprison industry programs among the various institutions); Klinger I, 31 F.3d at 731\n(holding that female inmates at the Nebraska Center for Women and male inmates at\nthe Nebraska State Penitentiary \"are not similarly situated for purposes of prison\nprograms and services\"). Each particular institution's size, location, and character,\nresulting from the different types or classifications of inmates housed there,\n\"necessarily will affect the number, type, and length of programs offered.\" Keevan,\n100 F.3d at 649. Any attempt to compare programs between and among different\nprisons where all of these varying factors are present \"is like the proverbial\ncomparison of apples to oranges.\" Klinger I, 31 F.3d at 733.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f       The undisputed record here confirms the presence of these types of varying\nfactors. Dakota Women's CRC is smaller and is located in a smaller community than\nthe DOCR institutions. Male inmates in the custody of the DOCR greatly outnumber\nthe female inmates. The DOCR pays more per inmate to house the female inmates.\nTwo-thirds of the female population are classified as minimum custody inmates and\nthe remainder are medium custody inmates, whereas, with the exception of the\nMissouri River CC (which holds only minimum custody males), the male institutions\nhouse predominately medium and maximum custody inmates with comparably longer\nsentences and longer periods of actual incarceration than the female inmates. As in\nKlinger I and Keevan, these differences make program comparisons between the\nprisons unworkable, and in any event, we will not permit the Female Inmates to now\nrevive the claim that they expressly abandoned.\n\n       Concerning the Female Inmates' pretransfer equal protection claims that arose\nout of their incarceration within the DOCR institutions, we agree with the district\ncourt that those claims are moot. \"In general, a pending claim for injunctive relief\nbecomes moot when the challenged conduct ceases and there is no reasonable\nexpectation that the wrong will be repeated.\" Mo. Pro. and Advocacy Servs., Inc. v.\nCarnahan, 499 F.3d 803, 811 (8th Cir. 2007) (internal marks omitted). \"A claim is\nproperly dismissed as moot if it has lost its character as a present, live controversy of\nthe kind that must exist if we are to avoid advisory opinions on abstract questions of\nlaw.\" Keevan, 100 F.3d at 647 (internal marks ommited). We lack \"jurisdiction over\ncases in which[,] due to the passage of time or a change in circumstances, the issues\npresented will no longer be live or the parties will no longer have a legally cognizable\ninterest in the outcome of the litigation.\" Van Bergen v. Minnesota, 59 F.3d 1541,\n1546 (8th Cir. 1995) (internal marks omitted). All of the Female Inmates have been\ntransferred out of the NDSP, the James River CC, and the Missouri River CC, and\nthere is no suggestion that they might be returned. Their class certification is for\ninjunctive relief, and any equal protection claim arising out of their previous housing\nin those other facilities is now moot.\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f                                      B. Title IX\n\n       \"[T]he standard for finding a Title IX violation differs from the standard\napplicable to a constitutional equal protection claim,\" and therefore, the \"failure to\nprove an equal protection violation does not preclude [a] Title IX claim as a matter of\nlaw.\" Klinger II, 107 F.3d at 614. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\nprovides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\" aside from\ncertain listed exceptions, and, significantly, prisons are not among the exceptions. 20\nU.S.C. §1681(a). A state's prison system as a whole qualifies as a program or activity\nwithin the meaning of Title IX. See Klinger II, 107 F.3d at 615 (citing 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1687(1)(A)). There is no dispute that the DOCR and the Dakota Women's CRC\nreceive federal funding.\n\n      The Female Inmates claim that gender-based inequalities exist in the prison\nindustries program and in the vocational programs offered to inmates within the\nDOCR system. The district court first concluded, on the undisputed record, that the\nprison industries operation is not an educational program or activity within the\nmeaning of Title IX, and this conclusion is supported by the undisputed facts. But see\nJeldness v. Pearce, 30 F.3d 1220, 1225-26 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding the question of\nwhether a prison work camp, farm, or prison industries are \"educational\" programs\nwithin the meaning of Title IX is a question of fact).\n\n      The express language of Title IX prohibits discrimination in \"any education\nprogram\" that receives federal funds. 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a) (emphasis added). The\nterm \"education\" is not defined by the statute or in the regulations governing Title IX,\nsee O'Connor v. Davis, 126 F.3d 112, 118 (2d Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1114\n(1998), and so we consider its ordinary meaning. See Crawford v. Metro. Gov't of\nNashville and Davidson County, Tenn., 129 S. Ct. 846, 850 (2009) (noting that a term\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fundefined by statute \"carries its ordinary meaning\"). The ordinary meaning of\neducation is very broad and could conceivably encompass every experience of life.\nAs relevant here, however, Title IX deals more specifically with \"education\nprograms.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). See O'Connor 126 F.3d at 118 (indicating that while\nthe 1988 amendments expanded the reach of Title IX to include all departments or\nbranches of an educational institution or program that receives federal funding, the\namendment \"did not purport to alter the preliminary requirement that the entity funded\noperate an 'education program.'\"). The federal regulations indicate that Title IX\nprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex \"under any academic, extracurricular,\nresearch, occupational training, or any other education program or activity operated\nby a recipient\" of federal funds. 45 C.F.R. § 86.31(a) (emphasis added). We look to\nthe primary purpose of a program to determine its character.\n\n      The \"prison industries\" program, as described by the undisputed facts on this\nrecord, is primarily an inmate work or employment program. It provides inmates with\npaying jobs, enabling them to make purchases, pay restitution orders, or support their\nfamilies. The contract between SWMCCC and the DOCR distinctly separates \"Inmate\nEmployment,\" which requires SWMCCC to provide institutional jobs and prison\ninmate work programs like prison industries (J.A. at 146), from \"Education and\nVocational Services,\" which requires SWMCCC to provide basic educational\nprograms as well as vocational education programs (id. at 168-69). The prison\nindustries jobs at the Dakota Women's CRC (a cut and sew operation and a lock/key\nindustry) require higher-level skills than most of the institution jobs.\n\n      The Female Inmates assert that there is a question of fact as to whether the\nprison industries program is an educational program within the meaning of Title IX.\nThey assert that there is evidence from which a trier of fact could consider prison\nindustries to be educational because the DOCR considers the prison industries\nprogram to provide an opportunity to learn skills and trades while on the job that will\nbe useful to their ability to obtain employment after incarceration. Accepting these\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\ffacts as true and even though the prison industries provide a beneficial learning\nopportunity, that benefit is incidental to and is not the primary focus of the prison\nindustries operation. We agree with the district court's conclusion that the type of on-\nthe-job training provided by the prison industries at the Dakota Women's CRC does\nnot transform it from principally a work program into an occupational training\nprogram or an educational program. Educational programs that prepare an individual\nto pursue a particular occupation or trade \"typically provide instructors, evaluations,\nand offer a particular course of training.\" O'Connor, 126 F.3d at 118. While on-the-\njob industry training has an educational component in the broadest sense of the term,\nthe record demonstrates that the primary purpose of the prison industries operation as\na whole is to provide employment, not educational opportunities. See generally\nWomen Prisoners of D.C. Dep't of Corr. v. Dist. of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910, 927 (D.C.\nCir. 1996) (\"But even though we do not address the scope of Title IX in the prison\ncontext, we admit to grave problems with the proposition that work details, prison\nindustries, recreation, and religious services and counseling have anything in common\nwith the equality of educational opportunities with which Title IX is concerned.\"),\ncert. denied, 520 U.S. 119 (1997).\n\n      Vocational education, on the other hand, is expressly within the scope of Title\nIX. See 20 U.S.C. § 1687(2)(B) (describing the term \"program\" to include a \"system\nof vocational education\"). See also Klinger II, 107 F.3d at 612 (involving a claim by\nwomen inmates that the educational and vocational training opportunities at one\nprison were inferior to those of male inmates at another). Again, we begin with the\npremise that \"[i]t is beyond controversy that male and female prisoners may lawfully\nbe segregated into separate institutions within a prison system, and that \"[g]ender-\nbased prisoner segregation and segregation based upon prisoners' security levels are\ncommon and necessary practices.\" Id. at 615. With this understanding, Title IX\nrequires a comparison of the educational opportunities available to female and to male\nprisoners within a state's entire system of federally funded correctional institutions,\n\"taking into account the objective differences between the male and female prison\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fpopulations and such penological and security considerations as are necessary to\naccommodate in this unique context.\" Klinger II, 107 F.3d at 616. Thus, where there\nexist significant differences between prison populations in gender-segregated prisons,\nsuch as unequal population sizes and lengths of stay, Title IX requires a comparison\nof the educational opportunities to ensure that the female inmates are receiving equal\neducational opportunities \"consistent with those differences.\" Id. at 616. \"'[P]rograms\nneed not be identical in number or content,'\" but the female inmates must be provided\nwith \"'reasonable opportunities for similar studies and . . . an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in programs of comparable quality.'\" Id. (quoting Jeldness, 30 F.3d at\n1229).\n\n       The district court carefully reviewed the vocational programs offered at each\ninstitution and found that all inmates have access to computer classes, work force\ntraining classes, and college classes. Female inmates at the Dakota Women's CRC\nalso have access to a welding class and classes in basic parenting, social skills, speech,\nand healthy lifestyles. The other DOCR institutions do not offer the same vocational\nprograms. Male inmates at the James River CC have access to a food service\nvocational program. The Missouri River CC offers an auto technical program,\nwelding courses, and carpentry courses. Male inmates at the NDSP, at various times,\nhave had access to a noncredit accounting course, a restaurant management class, and\na heating and air conditioning program. The district court concluded that, on this\nrecord, the differences in the availability and access to certain vocational programs\nresult from the location of the inmates, and that no facts give rise to an inference of\ninequalities based on gender.\n\n      The Female Inmates assert that their evidence demonstrates a growing disparity\nbetween the quality and quantity of vocational programming offered at the Dakota\nWomen's CRC and the programs offered at the male DOCR institutions, but their\nanalysis inappropriately combines all of the vocational programs offered at the\nDOCR's male institutions and contrasts it with the programs offered to the female\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\finmates at the Dakota Women's CRC, when in fact, male inmates at one DOCR\ninstitution have no access to vocational programs that are offered at another DOCR\ninstitution. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that, in the absence of discriminatory\nresidential assignment, a denial of participation in an educational class solely because\nwomen do not reside at the prison offering that class does not amount to unequal\ntreatment on the basis of their sex but on the basis of their location. Jeldness, 30 F.3d\nat 1229.\n\n       There are vocational opportunities available to the Female Inmates at the\nDakota Women's CRC, though they vary from those offered in the all-male\ninstitutions. The welding program does not offer college credit, but there is an\nopportunity for certification in their welding class, and there is no evidence that the\nmale inmates are earning college credit for welding in another institution. The Female\nInmates also complain that the record does not show any female participation in either\nthe welding or computer classes from March 2004 through July 2006, but the\nrequirements for participation are no different than for the male inmates, and the\nindividual female inmate's choice of whether to participate in a particular, available\nvocational course does not demonstrate unequal programming on the basis of sex.\nFinally, the Female Inmates' assertion that the male inmates have more work\nopportunities in which to gain vocational skills does not fall within the scope of Title\nIX.\n\n                                          III.\n\n      For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.\nWe also grant the Appellants' request for judicial notice, and we have taken judicial\nnotice of the Policies and Procedures Manual of the North Dakota Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation, Prison Division, attached to the request.\n                        _____________________________\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n       The undisputed facts indicate that since 1997, female inmates in the custody of\nthe North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (\"DOCR\") have been\nhoused in four separate prison facilities: the North Dakota State Penitentiary\n(\"NDSP\"); the Missouri River Correctional Center (\"Missouri River CC\"), also known\nas the farm; the James River Correctional Center (\"James River CC\"); and the Dakota\nWomen's Correction and Rehabilitation Center (\"Dakota Women's CRC\"), a facility\noperated by the Southwest-Multi-County Correctional Center (\"SWMCCC\") under\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fcontract with the DOCR.1 Prior to June 1998, the Female Inmates were all housed\nwith the male inmates either at the NDSP, which has approximately 550 beds, 60 of\nwhich were occupied by women, or at the smaller Missouri River CC, which has\napproximately 150 beds and housed 14 women. These facilities are both located in\nNorth Dakota's capital city of Bismarck. In June 1998, the James River CC opened\nin Jamestown, North Dakota, and all of the female inmates who had been housed at\nthe NDSP were transferred there. The James River CC houses around 374 inmates.\n\n        In 2003, the DOCR contracted with SWMCCC to house all of the female\ninmates together. SWMCCC is a partnership of six counties created pursuant to a\njoint powers agreement. SWMCCC established and operates two correctional\nfacilities. It renovated a Catholic boarding school in New England, North Dakota\n(population 527), into the Dakota Women's CRC, a 110-bed women-only correctional\nfacility. SWMCCC also operates a separate facility, the Dickinson jail. The Dakota\nWomen's CRC operates pursuant to SWMCCC's contract with the DOCR. Transfer\nof all women inmates to the Dakota Women's CRC began in 2003 and was completed\nby August of 2004.\n\n       The Female Inmates filed this lawsuit in 2003 against the DOCR, Elaine Little,\nPrison Director Timothy Schuetzle, and James River CC Warden Don Redmann\n(collectively \"the State Defendants\"), as well as SWMCCC, alleging discriminatory\nconditions in the facilities and programs offered to women inmates in DOCR\ninstitutions in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. At that time, the\nFemale Inmates were still housed at the Missouri River CC and the James River CC\nwith the male inmates, but their transfer to the Dakota Women's CRC was imminent.\n\n      1\n       Some women inmates are also housed at the Tompkins Rehabilitation Center\nin Jamestown and in transitional living centers in Fargo and Bismarck, but there are\nno allegations of unequal conditions or programming at these facilities. See\nRoubideaux, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 955 n.3.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fThe complaint alleged that the Female Inmates suffered discrimination on the basis\nof sex because the State Defendants provided unequal and inferior programs,\neducation, and services in comparison with those offered to the male inmates, and that,\n\"unless enjoined, defendants will transfer female inmates to county jails providing\nunequal and inferior facilities and programs in comparison to male inmates.\" (J.A. at\n24.) The complaint listed two gender-based North Dakota statutes that the Female\nInmates asserted authorized the DOCR to house female inmates in county facilities\nfor more than one year. See N.D.C.C. § 12-47-38 (Supp. 2007); N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-\n06.2 (2003) (expired).2 The district court certified the class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2)\nof the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, finding that the plaintiffs requested primarily\ninjunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n       After all of the women had been transferred to the Dakota Women's CRC, the\nState Defendants and SWMCCC sought summary judgment on the ground that the\nFemale Inmates could no longer demonstrate that they were similarly situated to the\nmale inmates, a necessary element of the equal protection analysis.

They also argued that the Female Inmates were not\nentitled to relief under Title IX because they failed to show discrimination in a\nprogram or activity within the meaning of Title IX.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Section 12-44.1-06.2 was enacted in 2003 and expired on June 30, 2005; it was\nreplaced with an identical provision, which expired in 2007. See N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-\n06.3 (2005) (expired June 30, 2007). Currently, a gender-neutral version exists in\n§ 12-44.1-06(3), but the gender-specific version of 2003 was in effect at the time the\nFemale Inmates were transferred to Dakota Women's CRC.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f       In response, the Female Inmates asserted that they were not attempting to\ncompare the programming decisions made at different institutions within the system,\nas did the inmates in Klinger I and Keevan. Instead, they claimed to be challenging\nthe gender-based \"policy, based on statute, of removing female inmates from the\ncustody of the [DOCR] . . . and sending them to the custody of local county jails\nwhere they are unable to take advantage of the programs and services offered by the\n[DOCR].\" (J.A. at 203.) Thus, they transformed the issue into a facial statutory\nchallenge, alleging that the gender-based classification in the statute resulted in a\ndiscriminatory decisionmaking process. They also continued to assert that inequalities\nin the prison industries program and vocational education programs offered to them\nviolated Title IX.\n\n       The district court permitted the Female Inmates to shift the focus of their equal\nprotection claim to the challenged statutes but granted summary judgment to the State\nDefendants and SWMCCC. The district court concluded that the Female Inmates\nlacked standing to challenge statutes that did not apply to them and that they had\nexpressly abandoned all equal protection claims aside from the statutory challenge.\nAlternatively, the district court concluded that the Female Inmates had failed to\ndemonstrate an intent to discriminate on the basis of gender. As to the Title IX claims,\nthe district court concluded that the prison industries program is not an education\nprogram within the meaning of Title IX and that the vocational training offered at the\nDakota Women's CRC was not shown to be inferior.

Although some of the statutory definitions overlap (for\ninstance, a \"jail\" is defined as a \"correctional facility\" and a \"correctional facility\" is\ndefined, in part, as a \"jail\"), see N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-01, we believe the statutory\nlanguage is clear and unambiguous. We consider each statute in turn.\n\n       The first challenged statute articulates the DOCR's contracting authority with\nregard to counties. It provides that, if there is no space in a qualified state facility, the\nDOCR must contract to house female inmates in a county jail that has the available\nspace, the ability to segregate male and female inmates, and the ability to provide the\nnecessary services and programs stated in the statute. See N.D.C.C. § 12-47-38.3 The\nterm \"county jail\" is not specifically defined by the statute. Its plain language\nindicates that it is a jail operated by a county. A jail is defined as \"a correctional\nfacility, including a county or city jail or a regional corrections center.\" N.D.C.C.\n§ 12-44.1-01(5). A \"regional corrections center\" is at once both a \"correctional\n\n\n       3\n        Section 12-47-38 provides in full as follows:\n       If there is no qualified state facility available, the director of the [DOCR]\n       shall contract with a county for the housing of female inmates in the\n       county jail, to the extent space is available in the county jail. The county\n       jail must be designed in a manner that can adequately segregate the\n       female inmates from the male inmates. Any county with which the\n       department contracts must have available and must provide the female\n       inmates access to educational and vocational programs, chemical\n       dependency treatment programs, mental health programs, medical\n       services, and adequate recreational facilities.\n\n                                            -7-\n\ffacility\" and a \"jail\" that is owned by several counties or cities. See N.D.C.C. § 12-\n44.1-01(7) (defining a \"regional corrections center\" as \"a correctional facility\nestablished and maintained by more than one county or city . . . for the confinement\nof inmates\"). Because the term \"county jail\" is not used as a defined term of art, it\nnecessarily includes the whole definition of \"jail\" modified only by the term \"county.\"\nThe fact that \"county jail\" is used in the singular is insignificant because words used\nin the singular in the North Dakota Century Code are meant to include the plural,\nexcept where a plainly contrary intention applies. See N.D.C.C. § 1-01-35.\nTherefore, because the Dakota Women's CRC is a \"correctional facility\" that is owned\nby several counties (SWMCCC), it is within the scope of a \"county jail\" under this\nstatute. And, while this statute sets forth particular restrictions on the DOCR's\ncontracting authority and lists services that must be available at the county facility, it\ndoes not articulate any requirement that a county jail or regional corrections center\nmust have operated as such prior to entering a contract with the DOCR.4\n\n         The second challenged statute works with the first by expanding the length of\ntime that a county correctional facility can house female inmates under a DOCR\ncontract. It authorized the DOCR to contract with SWMCCC to house female inmates\nfor more than one year with specified services. In North Dakota, correctional facilities\noperated by a county are subject to inspection by the DOCR and a grading system.\nA grade one classification is the highest classification permitted; it denotes that the\nDOCR has determined, based upon the facility's \"construction, size and usage,\" that\nit is fit to confine inmates for not more than one year. N.D.C.C. § 12-44.1-06(1)(a).\n\n\n\n\n      4\n        The State Defendants and SWMCCC argue that the Dakota Women's CRC is\na \"state contract facility,\" but because this phrase is not statutorily defined or\notherwise statutorily significant, it is merely descriptive. As such, a \"state contract\nfacility\" implies nothing more than that the facility now houses inmates pursuant to\nthe terms of a contract with the state.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fThe challenged statute, § 12-44.1-06.2 (2003),5 permits the county correctional facility\nto house female inmates for longer than one year by a contract with the DOCR, when\notherwise, a county correctional facility, even with the highest classification, would\nhave been limited to housing inmates for one year. Because of this statute, the DOCR\ncontract with SWMCCC validly authorized the Dakota Women's CRC to house the\nFemale Inmates for more than one year. Absent the challenged statute, the Dakota\nWomen's CRC would otherwise have been limited by statute to housing female\ninmates for one year at most. Both of the challenged statutes, then, worked together\nto permit the DOCR and SWMCCC to enter into the contract by which the Female\nInmates were transferred to, and are currently housed at, the Dakota Women's CRC\nfor more than one year. Accordingly, the Female Inmates have standing to challenge\nthe statutes.\n\n                      2. Merits of the Equal Protection Claim\n\n       \"The Equal Protection Clause generally requires the government to treat\nsimilarly situated people alike.\" Klinger I, 31 F.3d at 731 (citing City of Cleburne v.\nCleburne Living Ctr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 439 (1985)). \"The similarly situated inquiry\nfocuses on whether the plaintiffs are similarly situated to another group for purposes\nof the challenged government action,\" and so it is necessary to \"precisely define\" the\nclaim in order to determine what government action is being challenged.

See N.D.C.C. §§ 12-47-38, 12-44.1-06.2. When a statute\nemploys a gender-based classification, we apply a heightened review standard. See\nUnited States v.

While gender classifications may never be used \"to create\nor perpetuate [a] legal, social, and economic inferiority of women,\" id. at 534, we are\nmindful that this claim arises in a prison housing context where the program\ndifferences may result from the housing decision and that it is appropriate to segregate\nmale and female inmates on the basis of gender, see Klinger v.

The Female Inmates do not challenge the DOCR's\ngeneral policy of segregating male and female inmates by gender. Instead, they assert\nthat the gender-based classification contained in the challenged statutes resulted in a\ndiscriminatory decisionmaking process that worked to exclude them from any DOCR\nprograms.\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\f       After a careful review, we conclude that the undisputed evidence in the record\nraises no inference of discrimination in the decisionmaking process because the\nstatutes substantially relate to the important governmental objective of providing\nadequate segregated housing for women inmates. The undisputed evidence\ndemonstrates that the DOCR female population as a whole is much smaller than the\nmale population, that sufficient space to house the women in DOCR institutions was\nbecoming an issue as the entire prison population increased, and that, for the many\nreasons set forth in the complaint and throughout the record, female inmates were in\nneed of a separate facility to better meet their needs. Transferring the same number\nof male inmates instead of the women would not have resolved these issues for the\nfemale inmates. The statutes are substantially related to this important objective in\nthat they expressly require the DOCR to contract with county facilities that have\nadequate extra space for the female inmates, but only when there is no qualified state\nfacility available and only when the county facility is able to provide segregation from\nmale inmates and an appropriate level of services and programs for the female\ninmates. If those conditions are met, the county facility is authorized to house the\nfemale inmates for more than one year. The statutes substantially further the\ngovernment's legitimate and important objective of segregating women inmates from\nmale inmates while providing them with the same type of services that are available\nwithin the DOCR system. There is no evidence to suggest that any resulting\ndifferences in programming from this permissible segregation are caused by gender\ndiscrimination.\n\n      The Female Inmates argue that the decision to house them at the Dakota\nWomen's CRC was based on economic concerns born out of a desire to benefit\nwestern North Dakota economically rather than out of a concern for what was in their\nbest interests. Even assuming this is true, it does not raise an inference of\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender. The gender-based statutory scheme at issue is\nnot impermissibly discriminatory.\n\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f       The Female Inmates also attempt to make an as-applied challenge to the\nstatutes, asserting that they are, in fact, being denied the opportunity to participate in\nany programs operated in the DOCR system and that they are provided programs that\nare inferior to those offered within the DOCR institutions, even though the contract\nbetween the SWMCCC and the DOCR states an express intent to provide programs\nand services to the female inmates \"in parity\" with those provided to the male inmates\nhoused in the DOCR institutions. (J.A. at 138.) We agree with the district court,\nhowever, that the Female Inmates expressly abandoned this argument by their express\nassertion that they were \"not challenging the programming decisions made by the\nDOCR as to what programs should be offered at which facilities.\" Roubideaux, 523\nF. Supp. 2d at 964 (internal marks omitted). They voluntarily and consciously shifted\nthe focus of their argument to the decisionmaking process dictated by the gender-\nexplicit statutes. The type of equal protection argument they now couch as an as-\napplied challenge to the statutes moves beyond the initial decisionmaking process,\nwhere we found the male and female inmates to be similarly situated, and seeks to\nreturn to the type of program comparisons between institutions that we have held to\nbe unworkable and that the Female Inmates expressly abandoned. See Keevan, 100\nF.3d at 649-50 (holding that male and female inmates at different institutions in\nMissouri were not similarly situated with regard to challenging the assignment of\nprison industry programs among the various institutions); Klinger I, 31 F.3d at 731\n(holding that female inmates at the Nebraska Center for Women and male inmates at\nthe Nebraska State Penitentiary \"are not similarly situated for purposes of prison\nprograms and services\"). Each particular institution's size, location, and character,\nresulting from the different types or classifications of inmates housed there,\n\"necessarily will affect the number, type, and length of programs offered.\" Keevan,\n100 F.3d at 649. Any attempt to compare programs between and among different\nprisons where all of these varying factors are present \"is like the proverbial\ncomparison of apples to oranges.\" Klinger I, 31 F.3d at 733.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f       The undisputed record here confirms the presence of these types of varying\nfactors. Dakota Women's CRC is smaller and is located in a smaller community than\nthe DOCR institutions. Male inmates in the custody of the DOCR greatly outnumber\nthe female inmates. The DOCR pays more per inmate to house the female inmates.\nTwo-thirds of the female population are classified as minimum custody inmates and\nthe remainder are medium custody inmates, whereas, with the exception of the\nMissouri River CC (which holds only minimum custody males), the male institutions\nhouse predominately medium and maximum custody inmates with comparably longer\nsentences and longer periods of actual incarceration than the female inmates. As in\nKlinger I and Keevan, these differences make program comparisons between the\nprisons unworkable, and in any event, we will not permit the Female Inmates to now\nrevive the claim that they expressly abandoned.\n\n       Concerning the Female Inmates' pretransfer equal protection claims that arose\nout of their incarceration within the DOCR institutions, we agree with the district\ncourt that those claims are moot. \"In general, a pending claim for injunctive relief\nbecomes moot when the challenged conduct ceases and there is no reasonable\nexpectation that the wrong will be repeated.\" Mo.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\nprovides that \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded\nfrom participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under\nany education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\" aside from\ncertain listed exceptions, and, significantly, prisons are not among the exceptions. 20\nU.S.C. §1681(a).

There is no dispute that the DOCR and the Dakota Women's CRC\nreceive federal funding.\n\n      The Female Inmates claim that gender-based inequalities exist in the prison\nindustries program and in the vocational programs offered to inmates within the\nDOCR system.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850 (2009) (noting that a term\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fundefined by statute \"carries its ordinary meaning\"). The ordinary meaning of\neducation is very broad and could conceivably encompass every experience of life.\nAs relevant here, however, Title IX deals more specifically with \"education\nprograms.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). See O'Connor 126 F.3d at 118 (indicating that while\nthe 1988 amendments expanded the reach of Title IX to include all departments or\nbranches of an educational institution or program that receives federal funding, the\namendment \"did not purport to alter the preliminary requirement that the entity funded\noperate an 'education program.'\"). The federal regulations indicate that Title IX\nprohibits discrimination on the basis of sex \"under any academic, extracurricular,\nresearch, occupational training, or any other education program or activity operated\nby a recipient\" of federal funds. 45 C.F.R. § 86.31(a) (emphasis added). We look to\nthe primary purpose of a program to determine its character.\n\n      The \"prison industries\" program, as described by the undisputed facts on this\nrecord, is primarily an inmate work or employment program. It provides inmates with\npaying jobs, enabling them to make purchases, pay restitution orders, or support their\nfamilies. The contract between SWMCCC and the DOCR distinctly separates \"Inmate\nEmployment,\" which requires SWMCCC to provide institutional jobs and prison\ninmate work programs like prison industries (J.A. at 146), from \"Education and\nVocational Services,\" which requires SWMCCC to provide basic educational\nprograms as well as vocational education programs (id. at 168-69). The prison\nindustries jobs at the Dakota Women's CRC (a cut and sew operation and a lock/key\nindustry) require higher-level skills than most of the institution jobs.\n\n      The Female Inmates assert that there is a question of fact as to whether the\nprison industries program is an educational program within the meaning of Title IX.\nThey assert that there is evidence from which a trier of fact could consider prison\nindustries to be educational because the DOCR considers the prison industries\nprogram to provide an opportunity to learn skills and trades while on the job that will\nbe useful to their ability to obtain employment after incarceration. Accepting these\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\ffacts as true and even though the prison industries provide a beneficial learning\nopportunity, that benefit is incidental to and is not the primary focus of the prison\nindustries operation. We agree with the district court's conclusion that the type of on-\nthe-job training provided by the prison industries at the Dakota Women's CRC does\nnot transform it from principally a work program into an occupational training\nprogram or an educational program. Educational programs that prepare an individual\nto pursue a particular occupation or trade \"typically provide instructors, evaluations,\nand offer a particular course of training.\" O'Connor, 126 F.3d at 118. While on-the-\njob industry training has an educational component in the broadest sense of the term,\nthe record demonstrates that the primary purpose of the prison industries operation as\na whole is to provide employment, not educational opportunities. See generally\nWomen Prisoners of D.C. Dep't of Corr. v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724981\"><a href=\"/opinion/724981/women-prisoners-of-the-district-of-columbia-department-of-corrections-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927 (D.C.\nCir. 1996) (\"But even though we do not address the scope of Title IX in the prison\ncontext, we admit to grave problems with the proposition that work details, prison\nindustries, recreation, and religious services and counseling have anything in common\nwith the equality of educational opportunities with which Title IX is concerned.\"),\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997).\n\n      Vocational education, on the other hand, is expressly within the scope of Title\nIX. See 20 U.S.C. § 1687(2)(B) (describing the term \"program\" to include a \"system\nof vocational education\"). See also Klinger II, 107 F.3d at 612 (involving a claim by\nwomen inmates that the educational and vocational training opportunities at one\nprison were inferior to those of male inmates at another). Again, we begin with the\npremise that \"[i]t is beyond controversy that male and female prisoners may lawfully\nbe segregated into separate institutions within a prison system, and that \"[g]ender-\nbased prisoner segregation and segregation based upon prisoners' security levels are\ncommon and necessary practices.\" Id. at 615. With this understanding, Title IX\nrequires a comparison of the educational opportunities available to female and to male\nprisoners within a state's entire system of federally funded correctional institutions,\n\"taking into account the objective differences between the male and female prison\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fpopulations and such penological and security considerations as are necessary to\naccommodate in this unique context.\" Klinger II, 107 F.3d at 616. Thus, where there\nexist significant differences between prison populations in gender-segregated prisons,\nsuch as unequal population sizes and lengths of stay, Title IX requires a comparison\nof the educational opportunities to ensure that the female inmates are receiving equal\neducational opportunities \"consistent with those differences.\" Id. at 616. \"'[P]rograms\nneed not be identical in number or content,'\" but the female inmates must be provided\nwith \"'reasonable opportunities for similar studies and . . . an equal opportunity to\nparticipate in programs of comparable quality.'\" Id. (quoting Jeldness, 30 F.3d at\n1229).\n\n       The district court carefully reviewed the vocational programs offered at each\ninstitution and found that all inmates have access to computer classes, work force\ntraining classes, and college classes. Female inmates at the Dakota Women's CRC\nalso have access to a welding class and classes in basic parenting, social skills, speech,\nand healthy lifestyles. The other DOCR institutions do not offer the same vocational\nprograms. Male inmates at the James River CC have access to a food service\nvocational program. The Missouri River CC offers an auto technical program,\nwelding courses, and carpentry courses. Male inmates at the NDSP, at various times,\nhave had access to a noncredit accounting course, a restaurant management class, and\na heating and air conditioning program. The district court concluded that, on this\nrecord, the differences in the availability and access to certain vocational programs\nresult from the location of the inmates, and that no facts give rise to an inference of\ninequalities based on gender.\n\n      The Female Inmates assert that their evidence demonstrates a growing disparity\nbetween the quality and quantity of vocational programming offered at the Dakota\nWomen's CRC and the programs offered at the male DOCR institutions, but their\nanalysis inappropriately combines all of the vocational programs offered at the\nDOCR's male institutions and contrasts it with the programs offered to the female\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\finmates at the Dakota Women's CRC, when in fact, male inmates at one DOCR\ninstitution have no access to vocational programs that are offered at another DOCR\ninstitution. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that, in the absence of discriminatory\nresidential assignment, a denial of participation in an educational class solely because\nwomen do not reside at the prison offering that class does not amount to unequal\ntreatment on the basis of their sex but on the basis of their location. Jeldness, 30 F.3d\nat 1229.\n\n       There are vocational opportunities available to the Female Inmates at the\nDakota Women's CRC, though they vary from those offered in the all-male\ninstitutions. The welding program does not offer college credit, but there is an\nopportunity for certification in their welding class, and there is no evidence that the\nmale inmates are earning college credit for welding in another institution. The Female\nInmates also complain that the record does not show any female participation in either\nthe welding or computer classes from March 2004 through July 2006, but the\nrequirements for participation are no different than for the male inmates, and the\nindividual female inmate's choice of whether to participate in a particular, available\nvocational course does not demonstrate unequal programming on the basis of sex.\nFinally, the Female Inmates' assertion that the male inmates have more work\nopportunities in which to gain vocational skills does not fall within the scope of Title\nIX.\n\n                                          III.\n\n      For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.\nWe also grant the Appellants' request for judicial notice, and we have taken judicial\nnotice of the Policies and Procedures Manual of the North Dakota Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation, Prison Division, attached to the request.\n                        _____________________________\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f</pre>",
