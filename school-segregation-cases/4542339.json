The following month,\n\nplaintiff prevailed in a jury trial, where she was awarded $100,000 in damages.\n\n¶2             On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred by tendering three of plaintiff’s\n\nproposed jury instructions related to the Act, asserting those instructions inaccurately stated the\n\nlaw. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\f¶3                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4                                     A. Factual Overview\n\n¶5             From September 1997 until May 2010, plaintiff was a teacher for defendant’s\n\nJacksonville Head Start facility. Plaintiff is Caucasian and of a non-Pentecostal religion. In\n\nMarch 2010, plaintiff’s job performance was rated as above average, and she was recommended\n\nfor rehire for the 2010 to 2011 school year. During this time, plaintiff observed her site\n\nsupervisor, who was African-American and of the Pentecostal faith, slowly replacing vacant\n\npositions at the Jacksonville facility with new staff that were African-American and/or affiliated\n\nwith the supervisor’s Pentecostal church. By January 2010, approximately half of the\n\nJacksonville employees were associated with the Pentecostal church. The site supervisor denied\n\nshe had any authority to make hiring or termination decisions. Plaintiff and two of her\n\nCaucasian, non-Pentecostal coworkers complained of preferential treatment toward the new\n\nemployees, which included those employees receiving extra time off, receiving permission to\n\ncomplete work for the church during school hours, and opportunities for summer employment.\n\n¶6             Due to concerns over grant funding, in June 2010, all Head Start employees,\n\nincluding plaintiff, received termination letters. However, as of August 19, 2010, all but three\n\nemployees at the Jacksonville facilities had received their return-to-work letters. Plaintiff and the\n\ntwo other Caucasian, non-Pentecostal employees were the only employees who had not received\n\ntheir return-to-work letters. Defendant asserted the delay in sending plaintiff and her two\n\ncoworkers return-to-work letters was attributed to a pending internal audit of random workers\n\nthroughout its numerous Head Start programs, including those three employees at the\n\nJacksonville facility.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f¶7             On August 23, 2010, despite not receiving a return-to-work letter, plaintiff\n\nreported for orientation but was told to leave because she was not on the list as a teacher.\n\nAccording to defendant, this led to plaintiff thereafter engaging in disrespectful behavior, such as\n\ncursing, throwing a telephone, and being disruptive to the point where she was escorted from one\n\nof the Head Start facilities. Prior to these occurrences, defendant claimed plaintiff was scheduled\n\nto be recalled as a teacher for the 2010 to 2011 school year once the audit had been completed.\n\nHowever, defendant cited plaintiff’s behavior as its reason for not rehiring plaintiff. Plaintiff\n\ndenied all misbehavior other than cursing in a facility parking lot when she was alone with a\n\nfriend. A newly certified teacher, who was both African-American and Pentecostal, was hired as\n\na full-time teacher.\n\n¶8                                 B. Administrative Proceedings\n\n¶9             Plaintiff sought review of defendant’s decision not to hire her with the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights (Department) on the grounds that defendant had discriminated\n\nagainst her on the basis of her religion and race. In April 2011, the Department dismissed her\n\nclaim due to lack of substantial evidence.\n\n¶ 10                                 C. Trial Court Proceedings\n\n¶ 11                                   1. Pretrial Proceedings\n\n¶ 12           In October 2011, plaintiff filed her first amended complaint, alleging defendant’s\n\ndecision not to rehire her was a pretext for racial discrimination (count I) and religious\n\ndiscrimination (count II) and, therefore, it violated the Act. Id. Plaintiff asserted other teachers\n\nwho were non-Caucasian and Pentecostal, both those similarly situated and those of lesser\n\nexperience and seniority, were rehired.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f¶ 13           In November 2013, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting\n\nplaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case for discrimination. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion in February 2014, finding issues of material fact remained that precluded summary\n\njudgment. In June 2015, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint containing the same\n\nallegations of racial and religious discrimination.\n\n¶ 14                                        2. Jury Instructions\n\n¶ 15           Later that month, the parties filed their proposed jury instructions. Three of those\n\ninstructions are at issue on this appeal.\n\n¶ 16                          a. Plaintiff’s Instruction Nos. 15 and 16\n\n¶ 17           Plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 outline the elements of workplace\n\ndiscrimination based on race and religion. The instructions are nearly identical; the only\n\ndifference is that plaintiff’s instruction No. 15 included language regarding racial discrimination,\n\nwhereas plaintiff’s instruction No. 16 included language regarding religious discrimination. Due\n\nto the similarity of the instructions and the parties’ arguments, we address these instructions\n\ntogether.\n\n¶ 18           Plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 were tendered as follows. The bracketed\n\nlanguage highlights the differing language in plaintiff’s instruction No. 16. The first portion of\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 outlined plaintiff’s theory that defendant’s refusal to rehire\n\nher was based on pretext.\n\n                       “In this case, Plaintiff claims that she was not rehired to her\n\n               teaching position because of her race [religion]. Defendant denies\n\n               this claim and asserts that it did not rehire Plaintiff due to her\n\n               unprofessional conduct on or after August 23, 2010.\n\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f                       To succeed on this claim, Plaintiff must prove five things\n\n               by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n                       First, that Plaintiff is Caucasian [non-Pentecostal];\n\n                       Second, that Plaintiff applied for and was qualified to be\n\n               rehired to her teaching position;\n\n                       Third, that Defendant did not rehire Plaintiff to her teaching\n\n               position;\n\n                       Fourth, that Defendant rehired similarly situated non-\n\n               Caucasian [Pentecostal] teachers and other personnel who had less\n\n               seniority and less education than Plaintiff[;]\n\n                       Fifth, that Plaintiff sustained damages as a result of\n\n               Defendant’s decision not to rehire her[.]\n\n                       If you find from your consideration of all the evidence that\n\n               each of these propositions has been proven, then your verdict\n\n               should be for Plaintiff. On the other hand, if you find from your\n\n               consideration of all the evidence that any of these propositions has\n\n               not been proven, then your verdict should be for Defendant.”\n\nPlaintiff cited this portion of the instruction as a modified version of Illinois Pattern Jury\n\nInstruction, Civil, No. 250.02 (2006). Plaintiff later tendered the following additional language to\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16, which outlines her motivating-factor theory of liability:\n\n                       “In the alternative, Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance\n\n               of the evidence that her race [religion] was a motivating factor in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f               Defendant’s decision not to rehire her. A motivating factor is\n\n               something that contributed to Defendant’s decision.\n\n                       If you find that Plaintiff has proven that her race [religion]\n\n               contributed to Defendant’s decision not to rehire her, you must\n\n               then decide whether Defendant proved by a preponderance of the\n\n               evidence that it would not have rehired her even if Plaintiff was not\n\n               Caucasian [was Pentecostal]. If so, you must enter a verdict for the\n\n               Plaintiff but you may not award her damages.”\n\n¶ 19           This motivating-factor portion of plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 cited 7th\n\nCir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, No. 3.01 (2005 rev.). Defendant objected to the fourth\n\nelement of the pretext portion—“that Defendant rehired similarly situated non-Caucasian\n\n[Pentecostal] teachers and other personnel who had less seniority and less education than\n\nPlaintiff”—as incorrectly omitting plaintiff’s burden to prove causation. Further, defendant\n\nobjected to the mixed-motive paragraphs as inaccurately stating the law. Accordingly, defendant\n\ntendered alternative instructions, defendant’s instruction Nos. 11 and 12, which omitted the\n\nmixed-motive paragraphs and amended the fourth element of the pretext paragraphs to read:\n\n“that Defendant did not rehire Plaintiff because of her race [religion].” The trial court denied\n\ndefendant’s instruction Nos. 11 and 12 and ordered plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 given\n\nover defendant’s objections. Additionally, the jury instructions contained a scrivener’s error the\n\nparties corrected after the trial court read the instructions to the jury. Because the scrivener’s\n\nerror does not impact our analysis of this case, we will not address it.\n\n¶ 20                               b. Plaintiff’s Instruction No. 17\n\n¶ 21           Plaintiff’s instruction No. 17 read:\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                         “You must decide whether Defendant discriminated against\n\n               Plaintiff because of her race or religion. The fact that Defendant\n\n               may have treated some Caucasians or non-Pentecostal employees\n\n               favorably does not immunize it from liability in this case. In other\n\n               words, you may find Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff\n\n               even though Defendant did not discriminate against other\n\n               Caucasian or non-Pentecostal employees.”\n\nThis nonpattern instruction cited an unpublished federal district court case, Woods v. Von Maur,\n\nInc., No. 09 C 7800, 2012 WL 2062400 (N.D. Ill. June 7, 2012). Defendant objected to this\n\ninstruction, asserting it inaccurately conveyed the law. The trial court gave the instruction over\n\ndefendant’s objection.\n\n¶ 22                          3. The Verdict and Posttrial Proceedings\n\n¶ 23           At the conclusion of the July 2015 jury trial, the parties presented their closing\n\narguments, wherein plaintiff argued, “This case is about, [plaintiff] was discriminated [against]\n\nbased on race and religion in her termination. Was she terminated in August 2010 because of her\n\nrace *** and/or because of her religion? Was her race and religion a motivating factor for the\n\ndefendant when they did determine that she was terminated?” Plaintiff also argued the reasons\n\ndefendant gave for failing to rehire plaintiff were a pretext for its actual, discriminatory reasons.\n\n¶ 24           The jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against\n\ndefendant on both counts and assessed damages in the amount of $100,000. In October 2015,\n\ndefendant filed a motion for a new trial, asserting, in part, plaintiff’s jury instructions discussing\n\nplaintiff’s claims under the Act failed to accurately state the law, confused and misled the jury,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fand resulted in prejudice to defendant. The following month, the trial court denied defendant’s\n\nmotion.\n\n¶ 25           This appeal followed.\n\n¶ 26                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 27           On appeal, defendant asserts the trial court erred by tendering three of plaintiff’s\n\nproposed jury instructions related to the Act, arguing those instructions inaccurately stated the\n\nlaw. We begin by outlining the relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n¶ 28                                         A. The Act\n\n¶ 29           One of the public policies behind the Act is:\n\n               “To secure for all individuals within Illinois the freedom from\n\n               discrimination against any individual because of his or her race,\n\n               color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of\n\n               protection status, marital status, physical or mental disability,\n\n               military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable discharge from\n\n               military service in connection with employment, real estate\n\n               transactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of\n\n               public accommodations.” 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) (West 2010).\n\nWith respect to discrimination in a place of employment, the Act makes it a civil-rights violation:\n\n               “For any employer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with\n\n               respect to recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment,\n\n               selection for training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline,\n\n               tenure or terms, privileges or conditions of employment on the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f               basis of unlawful discrimination or citizenship status.” 775 ILCS\n\n               5/2-102(A) (West 2010).\n\n¶ 30           When Illinois courts analyze employment-discrimination cases brought under the\n\nAct, we adopt the same analytical framework set forth in United States Supreme Court decisions\n\naddressing claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to\n\n2000e-17 (2006)). Zaderaka v. Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, 131 Ill. 2d 172, 178, 545 N.E.2d\n\n684, 687 (1989).\n\n¶ 31           Having set forth some of the pertinent aspects of the Act, we now turn to the\n\nstandard of review.\n\n¶ 32                                   B. Standard of Review\n\n¶ 33           Depending on the issue presented, appellate courts must determine which of two\n\nstandards of review apply to the trial court’s decisions regarding jury instructions. Typically, we\n\nreview the court’s decision to grant or deny certain jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.\n\nStudt v. Sherman Health Systems, 2011 IL 108182, ¶ 13, 951 N.E.2d 1131. In those instances, we\n\nmust determine “whether, taken as a whole, the instructions are sufficiently clear so as not to\n\nmislead and whether they fairly and correctly state the law.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\nId. However, when the issue is whether the jury instructions accurately conveyed the applicable\n\nlaw, our review is de novo. Id.\n\n¶ 34           Whenever possible in a civil case, the trial court should use any applicable pattern\n\njury instructions. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 239(a) (eff. Apr. 13, 2013). In this particular case, however,\n\nthe parties agree no standard pattern instructions are available, which required the parties to craft\n\ntheir own nonpattern instructions. Where a nonpattern instruction is given, that instruction should\n\nbe “simple, brief, impartial, and free from argument.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f¶ 35            Even if the trial court errs by giving an improper instruction, a reviewing court\n\nwill ordinarily not reverse the trial court unless the instruction “clearly misled the jury and\n\nresulted in prejudice to the appellant.” Schultz v. Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter R.R.\n\nCorp., 201 Ill. 2d 260, 274, 775 N.E.2d 964, 973 (2002).\n\n¶ 36            We now turn to the merits of defendant’s argument.\n\n¶ 37                          C. Plaintiff’s Instruction Nos. 15 and 16\n\n¶ 38            Plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 each contain two sets of law based on two\n\ndiffering theories of the case. In the initial paragraphs, plaintiff’s instructions intended to outline\n\nthe law as it relates to pretext. In other words, plaintiff sought to prove defendant’s reason for\n\nfailing to rehire her—her alleged misbehavior—was pretext for discrimination. In the final\n\nparagraphs, plaintiff intended to outline the law as it relates to a mixed motive for discrimination.\n\nSaid another way, plaintiff sought to prove defendant had mixed motives—both legitimate and\n\nillegitimate reasons—for failing to rehire her. We address these two theories separately, but first,\n\nwe must address plaintiff’s argument that defendant has forfeited any issues with respect to\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16.\n\n¶ 39                                         1. Forfeiture\n\n¶ 40            Plaintiff asserts defendant has forfeited any challenge to these instructions by\n\nfailing to raise these issues before the trial court and tendering alternative instructions. See Deal\n\nv. Byford, 127 Ill. 2d 192, 202-03, 537 N.E.2d 267, 271 (1989) (“To preserve an objection to a\n\njury instruction a party must both specify the defect claimed and tender a correct instruction.”).\n\nThe record contradicts this assertion. Defendant specifically objected to plaintiff’s instruction\n\nNos. 15 and 16 for failing to accurately convey the law and offered alternative instructions.\n\nNonetheless, plaintiff asserts defendant failed to provide a definition of the phrase “because of”\n\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\fin its alternative instruction regarding the fourth element, which renders the argument forfeited.\n\nHowever, plaintiff fails to explain why such a definitional instruction was necessary. “When\n\nwords used in a jury instruction have a commonly understood meaning, the court need not define\n\nthem with the use of additional instructions; this is particularly true where the pattern jury\n\ninstructions do not provide that an additional definition is necessary.” People v. Manning, 334\n\nIll. App. 3d 882, 890, 778 N.E.2d 1222, 1228 (2002). Thus, we conclude defendant has not\n\nforfeited its argument that plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 failed to accurately state the law.\n\n¶ 41                                    2. Pretext Instruction\n\n¶ 42           The first portion of plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 sets forth five elements\n\nplaintiff was required to prove to support her theory that defendant’s reasoning for terminating\n\nher was based on pretext (i.e., a lie). The only element contested on appeal is the fourth element,\n\nwhich reads, “that Defendant rehired similarly situated non-Caucasian [Pentecostal] teachers and\n\nother personnel who had less seniority and less education than Plaintiff.”\n\n¶ 43           Defendant asserts plaintiff’s fourth element failed to include the element of\n\ncausation that defendant included in its alternative instruction. Plaintiff asserts she does not need\n\nto prove causation because discrimination based on pretext is not a tortious offense that requires\n\nthe element of causation.\n\n¶ 44           In support of its argument, defendant points to the language of the Act as\n\nrequiring causation. Defendant notes the purpose of the Act is “[t]o secure for all individuals\n\nwithin Illinois the freedom from discrimination against any individual because of his or her race,\n\ncolor, [or] religion.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) (West 2010). Accordingly, “[i]t is\n\na civil rights violation *** [f]or any employer to refuse *** renewal of employment *** on the\n\nbasis of unlawful discrimination.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2010).\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fDefendant highlights the aforementioned use of (“because”) and (“on the basis of”) in the statute\n\nas requiring plaintiff to demonstrate causation.\n\n¶ 45           According to defendant, as plaintiff’s instructions read, plaintiff only needed to\n\nshow defendant hired similarly situated teachers who were either non-Caucasian or Pentecostal,\n\nregardless of reasoning. We agree and conclude the language of the Act requires plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate a link between her race or religion and defendant’s decision not to rehire her when\n\nasserting the basis for the termination was pretextual.\n\n¶ 46           A plaintiff may present either direct or indirect evidence of discrimination.\n\nLalvani v. Human Rights Comm’n, 324 Ill. App. 3d 774, 790, 755 N.E.2d 51, 64 (2001). Direct\n\nevidence is that which “prove[s] the particular fact in question, without reliance on inference or\n\npresumption.” Id. at 791, 755 N.E.2d at 65. Under the direct method, “once a plaintiff in a Title\n\nVII case establishes by direct evidence that the employer placed substantial reliance on a\n\nprohibited factor, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat it would have made the same decision even if the prohibited factor had not been\n\nconsidered.” Id. at 790, 755 N.E.2d at 65. Nothing in the record demonstrates plaintiff presented\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination.\n\n¶ 47           By contrast, under the indirect method, the plaintiff must first establish a prima\n\nfacie case, then the defendant employer must rebut the presumption of discrimination by\n\narticulating, not proving, “a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.” Kalush v.\n\nDepartment of Human Rights Chief Legal Counsel, 298 Ill. App. 3d 980, 993, 700 N.E.2d 132,\n\n141 (1998). The plaintiff “must then prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n\nemployer’s articulated reason was not its true reason, but was instead a pretext for unlawful\n\ndiscrimination.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Lalvani, 324 Ill. App. 3d at 790, 755 N.E.2d\n\n\n\n                                               - 12 -\n\fat 64 (quoting Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 179, 545 N.E.2d at 687). “In this approach, the ultimate\n\nburden of persuading the trier of fact that there was unlawful discrimination remains at all times\n\nwith the plaintiff.” Id.\n\n¶ 48            Plaintiff relies on Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69 F.3d 1344\n\n(7th Cir. 1995), to support her contention that an employee need not demonstrate but-for\n\ncausation to support an employment-discrimination claim. In Hennessy, the plaintiff filed a\n\ndiscrimination lawsuit against her employer under Title VII, alleging her gender was the\n\nemployer’s motivating factor in terminating her position after she became pregnant and gave\n\nbirth. Id. at 1350. Hennessy is distinguishable from the present case because, unlike the matter\n\nbefore us, the plaintiff in Hennessy proceeded under the direct-evidence approach, which\n\nrequired the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the\n\nsame decision even if the prohibited factor had not been considered. Accordingly, we conclude\n\nplaintiff’s reliance on Hennessy is misplaced with respect to plaintiff’s pretext claim.\n\n¶ 49            During oral argument, plaintiff maintained United States Postal Service Board of\n\nGovernors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711 (1983), supports her claim that but-for causation is not\n\nrequired in employment-discrimination cases. In Aikens, a black postal service employee sued\n\nthe United States Postal Service, alleging discrimination against him in promotion decisions.\n\nThere, the United States Supreme Court held as follows: (1) where the suit was fully tried on the\n\nmerits, it was unnecessary for the parties thereafter to address the question of a prima facie case,\n\nand by so doing, the parties unnecessarily evaded the ultimate question of discrimination; and\n\n(2) a plaintiff in an equal-employment-opportunity case may prove his case by direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence, and the district court should not have required the plaintiff to submit\n\ndirect evidence of discriminatory intent. Id. at 713-14.\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f¶ 50           According to the Supreme Court, when the defendant fails to persuade the “court\n\nto dismiss the action for lack of a prima facie case, and responds to the plaintiff’s proof by\n\noffering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff’s rejection, the factfinder must then decide\n\nwhether the rejection was discriminatory.” Id. at 714-15. The Supreme Court determined the\n\nprima facie case was not an appropriate issue for the jury; rather, the ultimate issue was “whether\n\nthe defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff. [Citation.] In other words, is the\n\nemployer ... treating some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 715. The Court went on to\n\npoint out intentional discrimination can be proved not only by direct evidence but also by\n\ncircumstantial evidence. Thus, although the Aikens case does prohibit requiring direct evidence,\n\ncontrary to plaintiff’s argument, it also demonstrates that a plaintiff must prove he or she was\n\ndiscriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n¶ 51           Plaintiff asserts several of her instructions discussed the requirement of causation,\n\nthus curing any defect in the elements instructions. During questioning from this court at oral\n\nargument, counsel for plaintiff asserted the language at the beginning of (1) plaintiff’s instruction\n\nNos. 15 and 16, which begins with, “Plaintiff claims that she was not rehired to her teaching\n\nposition because of her race”; and (2) plaintiff’s instruction No. 17, which begins, “You must\n\ndecide whether defendant discriminated against Plaintiff because of her race or religion”\n\n(emphases added) satisfies the causation requirement. We disagree.\n\n¶ 52           An elements instruction is a roadmap for the jury, guiding its review of the\n\nevidence and defining what evidence it should look for in making its decision. The portion of\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15, 16, and 17, to which plaintiff refers, does inform the jury of the\n\nnature of plaintiff’s claim. However, the language following, “To succeed on this claim, Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fmust prove five things by a preponderance of the evidence,” instructs the jury as to what must be\n\nproved in order to entitle plaintiff to a verdict in her favor. As given, the instructions failed to\n\ninstruct the jury that in order to succeed on her claim, plaintiff was required to show she was not\n\nrehired because of her race or religion. Despite some instructions discussing the necessity of\n\nproving causation, the elements instruction, which sets forth the essential elements plaintiff\n\nneeded to prove, omitted the necessity of proving causation. Rather, defendant’s proffered\n\ninstructions (Nos. 11 and 12), which the trial court rejected, more accurately stated the law by\n\nincluding the element of causation as required by the Act. Accordingly, we conclude the court\n\nerred by giving plaintiff’s jury instructions, which inaccurately conveyed the law.\n\n¶ 53            Further, we conclude the error prejudiced defendant. See Schultz, 201 Ill. 2d at\n\n274, 775 N.E.2d at 973. “The function of jury instructions is to convey to the jury the correct\n\nprinciples of law applicable to the submitted evidence and, as a result, jury instructions must\n\nstate the law fairly and distinctly and must not mislead the jury or prejudice a party.” (Internal\n\nquotation marks omitted.) Doe v. University of Chicago Medical Center, 2014 IL App (1st)\n\n121593, ¶ 77, 20 N.E.3d 1. The only contested legal issue for the jury to determine regarding\n\nplaintiff’s pretext theory—whether defendant failed to rehire plaintiff because of her race or\n\nreligion—was not provided to the jury. The failure to include this component in the elements\n\ninstruction was both inaccurate and misleading. Given that we do not know which theory of\n\nliability the jury relied upon when it found in plaintiff’s favor, we conclude the failure to provide\n\nsuch an instruction was prejudicial to defendant. That plaintiff argues her instructions already\n\ncontained more issues of proof than necessary is unpersuasive, as the jury was deprived of an\n\ninstruction regarding the critical issue of causation. Regardless of the evidence, the fact that the\n\njury was not provided with the correct instructions regarding the law requires reversal.\n\n\n\n                                                 - 15 -\n\f¶ 54                             3. Motivating-Factor Instruction\n\n¶ 55           Although we have already determined plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16\n\ninaccurately stated the law, thus requiring remand for a new trial, we address the remaining\n\nissues with the jury instructions as they are likely to arise again on remand. Pielet v. Pielet, 2012\n\nIL 112064, ¶ 56, 978 N.E.2d 1000.\n\n¶ 56           The portion of the instructions regarding the motivating-factor language stated:\n\n                       “In the alternative, Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance\n\n               of the evidence that her race [religion] was a motivating factor in\n\n               Defendant’s decision not to rehire her. A motivating factor is\n\n               something that contributed to Defendant’s decision.\n\n                       If you find that Plaintiff has proven that her race [religion]\n\n               contributed to Defendants’ decision not to rehire her, you must\n\n               then decide whether Defendant proved by a preponderance of the\n\n               evidence that it would not have rehired her even if Plaintiff was not\n\n               Causasian [was Pentecostal]. If so, you must enter a verdict for the\n\n               Plaintiff but you may not award her damages.”\n\nThis addition to plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 cited 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions,\n\nCivil, No. 3.01. According to the Committee Comments, Instruction No. 3.01 is based on the\n\ncase of Gehring v. Case Corp., 43 F.3d 340, 344 (7th Cir. 1994). 7th Cir. Pattern Jury\n\nInstructions, Civil, No. 3.01, Committee Comments (2005 rev.) However, the language in\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 does not mirror the language included in 7th Cir. Pattern\n\nJury Instructions, Civil, No. 3.01. Rather, the language used by plaintiff comes from a\n\nrecommendation in the Committee Comments based on the reasoning used by other circuits\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\fwhen the plaintiff asserts the defendant had a “mixed motive” for terminating the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment or failing to rehire the plaintiff. The committee comment concludes by saying,\n\n“Without clear guidance in the circuit case law, the Committee cannot offer assistance in\n\ndetermining when a ‘mixed motive’ instruction is appropriate.” 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions,\n\nCivil, No. 3.01, Committee Comments (2005 rev.).\n\n¶ 57           That being said, Illinois courts do recognize the mixed-motive method of\n\ndetermining discrimination. See, e.g., Chicago Housing Authority v. Human Rights Comm’n, 325\n\nIll. App. 3d 1115, 759 N.E.2d 37 (2001). The question is whether plaintiff met the standard for\n\nestablishing defendant’s decision was based on a mixed motive in order to tender such a jury\n\ninstruction.\n\n¶ 58           The legal concepts of pretext and mixed motive are not interchangeable. Unlike\n\npretext, wherein the plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence of discrimination, “to use the mixed-\n\nmotive method, the plaintiff must show direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial\n\nnegative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.” (Internal quotations\n\nmarks omitted.) Id. at 1124, 759 N.E.2d at 46. The employee’s evidence must do more than\n\ncreate an inference of discrimination; rather, it must establish a clear nexus between the\n\nemployer’s reliance on an impermissible factor and its subsequent decision to discharge the\n\nemployee. See Board of Education of Schaumburg Community Consolidated School District No.\n\n54 v. Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board, 247 Ill. App. 3d 439, 461, 616 N.E.2d 1281,\n\n1295 (1993); Chicago Housing Authority, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 1125, 759 N.E.2d at 47. Once the\n\nplaintiff has provided the direct evidence that the employer relied on illegitimate criteria, the\n\nemployer must demonstrate it would have reached the same decision even if it did not rely on\n\nillegitimate criteria. Id. at 1124, 759 N.E.2d at 46.\n\n\n\n                                                - 17 -\n\f¶ 59           Here, plaintiff presented no direct evidence of discrimination showing that the\n\ndecision makers placed substantial negative reliance on an illegal criterion in deciding not to\n\nrehire her. Moreover, plaintiff’s case did not rest on the allegation that defendant’s motives were\n\nboth legitimate and illegitimate; plaintiff vehemently denied engaging in the misbehavior cited\n\nby defendant as the reason for her termination. Rather, plaintiff’s theory of the case was that\n\ndefendant’s reason for not rehiring her was based solely on pretext, which allows the plaintiff to\n\nrely on indirect evidence. Id. at 1123, 759 N.E.2d at 45.\n\n¶ 60           Because plaintiff failed to present evidence that defendant’s reason for\n\nterminating her was based on a mixed motive, it was erroneous for the trial court to give such an\n\ninstruction.\n\n¶ 61                             D. Plaintiff’s Instruction No. 17\n\n¶ 62           Defendant next asserts the trial court erred by allowing plaintiff’s instruction No.\n\n17, based on an unpublished district court case, Woods, 2012 WL 2062400. During the\n\ninstruction conference, plaintiff represented the proposed instruction was given in the Woods\n\ncase. The instruction read:\n\n                       “You must decide whether Defendant discriminated against\n\n               Plaintiff because of her race or religion. The fact that Defendant\n\n               may have treated some Caucasians or non-Pentecostal employees\n\n               favorably does not immunize it from liability in this case. In other\n\n               words, you may find Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff\n\n               even though Defendant did not discriminate against other\n\n               Caucasian or non-Pentecostal employees.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f¶ 63           Given Woods is devoid of any discussion of the use of the above instruction,\n\nciting Woods to the trial court seems questionable. However, plaintiff’s instruction does contain\n\nan accurate statement of law. In Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 455 (1982), the Supreme\n\nCourt concluded Title VII “never intended to give an employer license to discriminate against\n\nsome employees on the basis of race or sex merely because he favorably treats other members of\n\nthe employees’ group.” Rather, the statute was written for the “protection of the individual\n\nemployee, rather than the protection of a minority group as a whole.” Id. at 453-54. Although the\n\nparties point to no published Illinois cases that include this statement in their jury instructions,\n\nthat does not make the statement inaccurate. The Act contains the same framework as that\n\ncontained in Title VII, and we analyze cases under the Act according to Supreme Court decisions\n\nbased on Title VII. Chicago Housing Authority, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 1123, 759 N.E.2d at 45. The\n\nTeal case stands for the proposition stated in plaintiff’s instruction No. 17: “The fact that\n\nDefendant may have treated some Caucasians or non-Pentecostal employees favorably does not\n\nimmunize it from liability in this case.” Accordingly, we conclude this instruction contains an\n\naccurate statement of the law and the trial court properly tendered it to the jury.\n\n¶ 64           We note the first line of the instruction, however, would be redundant once the\n\nelements instructions (plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16) are corrected. See Montefusco v.\n\nCecon Construction Co., 74 Ill. App. 3d 319, 325, 392 N.E.2d 1103, 1107 (1979) (repetitious\n\njury instructions should be avoided).\n\n¶ 65                                     III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 66           For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\n¶ 67           Reversed; cause remanded for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 19 -\n\f",

The following month,\n\nplaintiff prevailed in a jury trial, where she was awarded $100,000 in damages.\n\n¶2             On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred by tendering three of plaintiff’s\n\nproposed jury instructions related to the Act, asserting those instructions inaccurately stated the\n\nlaw. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n\f¶3                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4                                     A. Factual Overview\n\n¶5             From September 1997 until May 2010, plaintiff was a teacher for defendant’s\n\nJacksonville Head Start facility. Plaintiff is Caucasian and of a non-Pentecostal religion. In\n\nMarch 2010, plaintiff’s job performance was rated as above average, and she was recommended\n\nfor rehire for the 2010 to 2011 school year. During this time, plaintiff observed her site\n\nsupervisor, who was African-American and of the Pentecostal faith, slowly replacing vacant\n\npositions at the Jacksonville facility with new staff that were African-American and/or affiliated\n\nwith the supervisor’s Pentecostal church. By January 2010, approximately half of the\n\nJacksonville employees were associated with the Pentecostal church. The site supervisor denied\n\nshe had any authority to make hiring or termination decisions. Plaintiff and two of her\n\nCaucasian, non-Pentecostal coworkers complained of preferential treatment toward the new\n\nemployees, which included those employees receiving extra time off, receiving permission to\n\ncomplete work for the church during school hours, and opportunities for summer employment.\n\n¶6             Due to concerns over grant funding, in June 2010, all Head Start employees,\n\nincluding plaintiff, received termination letters. However, as of August 19, 2010, all but three\n\nemployees at the Jacksonville facilities had received their return-to-work letters. Plaintiff and the\n\ntwo other Caucasian, non-Pentecostal employees were the only employees who had not received\n\ntheir return-to-work letters. Defendant asserted the delay in sending plaintiff and her two\n\ncoworkers return-to-work letters was attributed to a pending internal audit of random workers\n\nthroughout its numerous Head Start programs, including those three employees at the\n\nJacksonville facility.\n\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f¶7             On August 23, 2010, despite not receiving a return-to-work letter, plaintiff\n\nreported for orientation but was told to leave because she was not on the list as a teacher.\n\nAccording to defendant, this led to plaintiff thereafter engaging in disrespectful behavior, such as\n\ncursing, throwing a telephone, and being disruptive to the point where she was escorted from one\n\nof the Head Start facilities. Prior to these occurrences, defendant claimed plaintiff was scheduled\n\nto be recalled as a teacher for the 2010 to 2011 school year once the audit had been completed.\n\nHowever, defendant cited plaintiff’s behavior as its reason for not rehiring plaintiff. Plaintiff\n\ndenied all misbehavior other than cursing in a facility parking lot when she was alone with a\n\nfriend. A newly certified teacher, who was both African-American and Pentecostal, was hired as\n\na full-time teacher.\n\n¶8                                 B. Administrative Proceedings\n\n¶9             Plaintiff sought review of defendant’s decision not to hire her with the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights (Department) on the grounds that defendant had discriminated\n\nagainst her on the basis of her religion and race. In April 2011, the Department dismissed her\n\nclaim due to lack of substantial evidence.\n\n¶ 10                                 C. Trial Court Proceedings\n\n¶ 11                                   1. Pretrial Proceedings\n\n¶ 12           In October 2011, plaintiff filed her first amended complaint, alleging defendant’s\n\ndecision not to rehire her was a pretext for racial discrimination (count I) and religious\n\ndiscrimination (count II) and, therefore, it violated the Act. Id. Plaintiff asserted other teachers\n\nwho were non-Caucasian and Pentecostal, both those similarly situated and those of lesser\n\nexperience and seniority, were rehired.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f¶ 13           In November 2013, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting\n\nplaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case for discrimination. The trial court denied the\n\nmotion in February 2014, finding issues of material fact remained that precluded summary\n\njudgment. In June 2015, plaintiff filed a second amended complaint containing the same\n\nallegations of racial and religious discrimination.\n\n¶ 14                                        2. Jury Instructions\n\n¶ 15           Later that month, the parties filed their proposed jury instructions. Three of those\n\ninstructions are at issue on this appeal.\n\n¶ 16                          a. Plaintiff’s Instruction Nos. 15 and 16\n\n¶ 17           Plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 outline the elements of workplace\n\ndiscrimination based on race and religion. The instructions are nearly identical; the only\n\ndifference is that plaintiff’s instruction No. 15 included language regarding racial discrimination,\n\nwhereas plaintiff’s instruction No. 16 included language regarding religious discrimination. Due\n\nto the similarity of the instructions and the parties’ arguments, we address these instructions\n\ntogether.\n\n¶ 18           Plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 were tendered as follows. The bracketed\n\nlanguage highlights the differing language in plaintiff’s instruction No. 16. The first portion of\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 outlined plaintiff’s theory that defendant’s refusal to rehire\n\nher was based on pretext.\n\n                       “In this case, Plaintiff claims that she was not rehired to her\n\n               teaching position because of her race [religion]. Defendant denies\n\n               this claim and asserts that it did not rehire Plaintiff due to her\n\n               unprofessional conduct on or after August 23, 2010.\n\n\n\n                                                   -4-\n\f                       To succeed on this claim, Plaintiff must prove five things\n\n               by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n                       First, that Plaintiff is Caucasian [non-Pentecostal];\n\n                       Second, that Plaintiff applied for and was qualified to be\n\n               rehired to her teaching position;\n\n                       Third, that Defendant did not rehire Plaintiff to her teaching\n\n               position;\n\n                       Fourth, that Defendant rehired similarly situated non-\n\n               Caucasian [Pentecostal] teachers and other personnel who had less\n\n               seniority and less education than Plaintiff[;]\n\n                       Fifth, that Plaintiff sustained damages as a result of\n\n               Defendant’s decision not to rehire her[.]\n\n                       If you find from your consideration of all the evidence that\n\n               each of these propositions has been proven, then your verdict\n\n               should be for Plaintiff. On the other hand, if you find from your\n\n               consideration of all the evidence that any of these propositions has\n\n               not been proven, then your verdict should be for Defendant.”\n\nPlaintiff cited this portion of the instruction as a modified version of Illinois Pattern Jury\n\nInstruction, Civil, No. 250.02 (2006). Plaintiff later tendered the following additional language to\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16, which outlines her motivating-factor theory of liability:\n\n                       “In the alternative, Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance\n\n               of the evidence that her race [religion] was a motivating factor in\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -5-\n\f               Defendant’s decision not to rehire her. A motivating factor is\n\n               something that contributed to Defendant’s decision.\n\n                       If you find that Plaintiff has proven that her race [religion]\n\n               contributed to Defendant’s decision not to rehire her, you must\n\n               then decide whether Defendant proved by a preponderance of the\n\n               evidence that it would not have rehired her even if Plaintiff was not\n\n               Caucasian [was Pentecostal]. If so, you must enter a verdict for the\n\n               Plaintiff but you may not award her damages.”\n\n¶ 19           This motivating-factor portion of plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 cited 7th\n\nCir. Pattern Jury Instructions, Civil, No. 3.01 (2005 rev.). Defendant objected to the fourth\n\nelement of the pretext portion—“that Defendant rehired similarly situated non-Caucasian\n\n[Pentecostal] teachers and other personnel who had less seniority and less education than\n\nPlaintiff”—as incorrectly omitting plaintiff’s burden to prove causation. Further, defendant\n\nobjected to the mixed-motive paragraphs as inaccurately stating the law. Accordingly, defendant\n\ntendered alternative instructions, defendant’s instruction Nos. 11 and 12, which omitted the\n\nmixed-motive paragraphs and amended the fourth element of the pretext paragraphs to read:\n\n“that Defendant did not rehire Plaintiff because of her race [religion].” The trial court denied\n\ndefendant’s instruction Nos. 11 and 12 and ordered plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 given\n\nover defendant’s objections. Additionally, the jury instructions contained a scrivener’s error the\n\nparties corrected after the trial court read the instructions to the jury. Because the scrivener’s\n\nerror does not impact our analysis of this case, we will not address it.\n\n¶ 20                               b. Plaintiff’s Instruction No. 17\n\n¶ 21           Plaintiff’s instruction No. 17 read:\n\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\f                         “You must decide whether Defendant discriminated against\n\n               Plaintiff because of her race or religion. The fact that Defendant\n\n               may have treated some Caucasians or non-Pentecostal employees\n\n               favorably does not immunize it from liability in this case. In other\n\n               words, you may find Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff\n\n               even though Defendant did not discriminate against other\n\n               Caucasian or non-Pentecostal employees.”\n\nThis nonpattern instruction cited an unpublished federal district court case, Woods v. Von Maur,\n\nInc., No. 09 C 7800, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2062400</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.D. Ill. June 7, 2012). Defendant objected to this\n\ninstruction, asserting it inaccurately conveyed the law. The trial court gave the instruction over\n\ndefendant’s objection.\n\n¶ 22                          3. The Verdict and Posttrial Proceedings\n\n¶ 23           At the conclusion of the July 2015 jury trial, the parties presented their closing\n\narguments, wherein plaintiff argued, “This case is about, [plaintiff] was discriminated [against]\n\nbased on race and religion in her termination. Was she terminated in August 2010 because of her\n\nrace *** and/or because of her religion? Was her race and religion a motivating factor for the\n\ndefendant when they did determine that she was terminated?” Plaintiff also argued the reasons\n\ndefendant gave for failing to rehire plaintiff were a pretext for its actual, discriminatory reasons.\n\n¶ 24           The jury subsequently returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff and against\n\ndefendant on both counts and assessed damages in the amount of $100,000. In October 2015,\n\ndefendant filed a motion for a new trial, asserting, in part, plaintiff’s jury instructions discussing\n\nplaintiff’s claims under the Act failed to accurately state the law, confused and misled the jury,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fand resulted in prejudice to defendant. The following month, the trial court denied defendant’s\n\nmotion.\n\n¶ 25           This appeal followed.\n\n¶ 26                                      II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶ 27           On appeal, defendant asserts the trial court erred by tendering three of plaintiff’s\n\nproposed jury instructions related to the Act, arguing those instructions inaccurately stated the\n\nlaw. We begin by outlining the relevant provisions of the Act.\n\n¶ 28                                         A. The Act\n\n¶ 29           One of the public policies behind the Act is:\n\n               “To secure for all individuals within Illinois the freedom from\n\n               discrimination against any individual because of his or her race,\n\n               color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, order of\n\n               protection status, marital status, physical or mental disability,\n\n               military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable discharge from\n\n               military service in connection with employment, real estate\n\n               transactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of\n\n               public accommodations.” 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) (West 2010).\n\nWith respect to discrimination in a place of employment, the Act makes it a civil-rights violation:\n\n               “For any employer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with\n\n               respect to recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment,\n\n               selection for training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline,\n\n               tenure or terms, privileges or conditions of employment on the\n\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f               basis of unlawful discrimination or citizenship status.” 775 ILCS\n\n               5/2-102(A) (West 2010).\n\n¶ 30           When Illinois courts analyze employment-discrimination cases brought under the\n\nAct, we adopt the same analytical framework set forth in United States Supreme Court decisions\n\naddressing claims arising under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to\n\n2000e-17 (2006)).

Standard of Review\n\n¶ 33           Depending on the issue presented, appellate courts must determine which of two\n\nstandards of review apply to the trial court’s decisions regarding jury instructions. Typically, we\n\nreview the court’s decision to grant or deny certain jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.\n\nStudt v. Sherman Health Systems, 2011 IL 108182, ¶ 13, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2524846\"><a href=\"/opinion/2524846/studt-v-sherman-health-systems/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In those instances, we\n\nmust determine “whether, taken as a whole, the instructions are sufficiently clear so as not to\n\nmislead and whether they fairly and correctly state the law.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\nId. However, when the issue is whether the jury instructions accurately conveyed the applicable\n\nlaw, our review is de novo. Id.\n\n¶ 34           Whenever possible in a civil case, the trial court should use any applicable pattern\n\njury instructions. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 239(a) (eff. Apr. 13, 2013). In this particular case, however,\n\nthe parties agree no standard pattern instructions are available, which required the parties to craft\n\ntheir own nonpattern instructions. Where a nonpattern instruction is given, that instruction should\n\nbe “simple, brief, impartial, and free from argument.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 -9-\n\f¶ 35            Even if the trial court errs by giving an improper instruction, a reviewing court\n\nwill ordinarily not reverse the trial court unless the instruction “clearly misled the jury and\n\nresulted in prejudice to the appellant.” Schultz v.

Plaintiff’s Instruction Nos. 15 and 16\n\n¶ 38            Plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 each contain two sets of law based on two\n\ndiffering theories of the case. In the initial paragraphs, plaintiff’s instructions intended to outline\n\nthe law as it relates to pretext. In other words, plaintiff sought to prove defendant’s reason for\n\nfailing to rehire her—her alleged misbehavior—was pretext for discrimination. In the final\n\nparagraphs, plaintiff intended to outline the law as it relates to a mixed motive for discrimination.\n\nSaid another way, plaintiff sought to prove defendant had mixed motives—both legitimate and\n\nillegitimate reasons—for failing to rehire her. We address these two theories separately, but first,\n\nwe must address plaintiff’s argument that defendant has forfeited any issues with respect to\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16.\n\n¶ 39                                         1. Forfeiture\n\n¶ 40            Plaintiff asserts defendant has forfeited any challenge to these instructions by\n\nfailing to raise these issues before the trial court and tendering alternative instructions. See Deal\n\nv. Byford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2077502\"><a href=\"/opinion/2077502/deal-v-byford/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 202-03, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2077502\"><a href=\"/opinion/2077502/deal-v-byford/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 271 (1989) (“To preserve an objection to a\n\njury instruction a party must both specify the defect claimed and tender a correct instruction.”).\n\nThe record contradicts this assertion. Defendant specifically objected to plaintiff’s instruction\n\nNos. 15 and 16 for failing to accurately convey the law and offered alternative instructions.\n\nNonetheless, plaintiff asserts defendant failed to provide a definition of the phrase “because of”\n\n\n\n                                                 - 10 -\n\fin its alternative instruction regarding the fourth element, which renders the argument forfeited.\n\nHowever, plaintiff fails to explain why such a definitional instruction was necessary. “When\n\nwords used in a jury instruction have a commonly understood meaning, the court need not define\n\nthem with the use of additional instructions; this is particularly true where the pattern jury\n\ninstructions do not provide that an additional definition is necessary.” People v.

Thus, we conclude defendant has not\n\nforfeited its argument that plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 failed to accurately state the law.\n\n¶ 41                                    2. Pretext Instruction\n\n¶ 42           The first portion of plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 sets forth five elements\n\nplaintiff was required to prove to support her theory that defendant’s reasoning for terminating\n\nher was based on pretext (i.e., a lie). The only element contested on appeal is the fourth element,\n\nwhich reads, “that Defendant rehired similarly situated non-Caucasian [Pentecostal] teachers and\n\nother personnel who had less seniority and less education than Plaintiff.”\n\n¶ 43           Defendant asserts plaintiff’s fourth element failed to include the element of\n\ncausation that defendant included in its alternative instruction. Plaintiff asserts she does not need\n\nto prove causation because discrimination based on pretext is not a tortious offense that requires\n\nthe element of causation.\n\n¶ 44           In support of its argument, defendant points to the language of the Act as\n\nrequiring causation. Defendant notes the purpose of the Act is “[t]o secure for all individuals\n\nwithin Illinois the freedom from discrimination against any individual because of his or her race,\n\ncolor, [or] religion.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS 5/1-102(A) (West 2010). Accordingly, “[i]t is\n\na civil rights violation *** [f]or any employer to refuse *** renewal of employment *** on the\n\nbasis of unlawful discrimination.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2010).\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\fDefendant highlights the aforementioned use of (“because”) and (“on the basis of”) in the statute\n\nas requiring plaintiff to demonstrate causation.\n\n¶ 45           According to defendant, as plaintiff’s instructions read, plaintiff only needed to\n\nshow defendant hired similarly situated teachers who were either non-Caucasian or Pentecostal,\n\nregardless of reasoning. We agree and conclude the language of the Act requires plaintiff to\n\ndemonstrate a link between her race or religion and defendant’s decision not to rehire her when\n\nasserting the basis for the termination was pretextual.\n\n¶ 46           A plaintiff may present either direct or indirect evidence of discrimination.\n\nLalvani v.

Direct\n\nevidence is that which “prove[s] the particular fact in question, without reliance on inference or\n\npresumption.” Id. at 791, 755 N.E.2d at 65. Under the direct method, “once a plaintiff in a Title\n\nVII case establishes by direct evidence that the employer placed substantial reliance on a\n\nprohibited factor, the burden shifts to the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat it would have made the same decision even if the prohibited factor had not been\n\nconsidered.” Id. at 790, 755 N.E.2d at 65. Nothing in the record demonstrates plaintiff presented\n\ndirect evidence of discrimination.\n\n¶ 47           By contrast, under the indirect method, the plaintiff must first establish a prima\n\nfacie case, then the defendant employer must rebut the presumption of discrimination by\n\narticulating, not proving, “a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.” Kalush v.\n\nDepartment of Human Rights Chief Legal Counsel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083581\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083581/kalush-v-illinois-dept-of-human-rights/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

In Hennessy, the plaintiff filed a\n\ndiscrimination lawsuit against her employer under Title VII, alleging her gender was the\n\nemployer’s motivating factor in terminating her position after she became pregnant and gave\n\nbirth. Id. at 1350. Hennessy is distinguishable from the present case because, unlike the matter\n\nbefore us, the plaintiff in Hennessy proceeded under the direct-evidence approach, which\n\nrequired the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the\n\nsame decision even if the prohibited factor had not been considered. Accordingly, we conclude\n\nplaintiff’s reliance on Hennessy is misplaced with respect to plaintiff’s pretext claim.\n\n¶ 49            During oral argument, plaintiff maintained United States Postal Service Board of\n\nGovernors v. Aikens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110899\"><a href=\"/opinion/110899/postal-service-bd-of-governors-v-aikens/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), supports her claim that but-for causation is not\n\nrequired in employment-discrimination cases. In Aikens, a black postal service employee sued\n\nthe United States Postal Service, alleging discrimination against him in promotion decisions.\n\nThere, the United States Supreme Court held as follows: (1) where the suit was fully tried on the\n\nmerits, it was unnecessary for the parties thereafter to address the question of a prima facie case,\n\nand by so doing, the parties unnecessarily evaded the ultimate question of discrimination; and\n\n(2) a plaintiff in an equal-employment-opportunity case may prove his case by direct or\n\ncircumstantial evidence, and the district court should not have required the plaintiff to submit\n\ndirect evidence of discriminatory intent. Id. at 713-14.\n\n\n\n                                               - 13 -\n\f¶ 50           According to the Supreme Court, when the defendant fails to persuade the “court\n\nto dismiss the action for lack of a prima facie case, and responds to the plaintiff’s proof by\n\noffering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff’s rejection, the factfinder must then decide\n\nwhether the rejection was discriminatory.” Id. at 714-15. The Supreme Court determined the\n\nprima facie case was not an appropriate issue for the jury; rather, the ultimate issue was “whether\n\nthe defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff. [Citation.] In other words, is the\n\nemployer ... treating some people less favorably than others because of their race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 715. The Court went on to\n\npoint out intentional discrimination can be proved not only by direct evidence but also by\n\ncircumstantial evidence. Thus, although the Aikens case does prohibit requiring direct evidence,\n\ncontrary to plaintiff’s argument, it also demonstrates that a plaintiff must prove he or she was\n\ndiscriminated against because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n¶ 51           Plaintiff asserts several of her instructions discussed the requirement of causation,\n\nthus curing any defect in the elements instructions. During questioning from this court at oral\n\nargument, counsel for plaintiff asserted the language at the beginning of (1) plaintiff’s instruction\n\nNos. 15 and 16, which begins with, “Plaintiff claims that she was not rehired to her teaching\n\nposition because of her race”; and (2) plaintiff’s instruction No. 17, which begins, “You must\n\ndecide whether defendant discriminated against Plaintiff because of her race or religion”\n\n(emphases added) satisfies the causation requirement. We disagree.\n\n¶ 52           An elements instruction is a roadmap for the jury, guiding its review of the\n\nevidence and defining what evidence it should look for in making its decision. The portion of\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15, 16, and 17, to which plaintiff refers, does inform the jury of the\n\nnature of plaintiff’s claim. However, the language following, “To succeed on this claim, Plaintiff\n\n\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fmust prove five things by a preponderance of the evidence,” instructs the jury as to what must be\n\nproved in order to entitle plaintiff to a verdict in her favor. As given, the instructions failed to\n\ninstruct the jury that in order to succeed on her claim, plaintiff was required to show she was not\n\nrehired because of her race or religion. Despite some instructions discussing the necessity of\n\nproving causation, the elements instruction, which sets forth the essential elements plaintiff\n\nneeded to prove, omitted the necessity of proving causation. Rather, defendant’s proffered\n\ninstructions (Nos. 11 and 12), which the trial court rejected, more accurately stated the law by\n\nincluding the element of causation as required by the Act. Accordingly, we conclude the court\n\nerred by giving plaintiff’s jury instructions, which inaccurately conveyed the law.\n\n¶ 53            Further, we conclude the error prejudiced defendant. See Schultz, 201 Ill. 2d at\n\n274, 775 N.E.2d at 973. “The function of jury instructions is to convey to the jury the correct\n\nprinciples of law applicable to the submitted evidence and, as a result, jury instructions must\n\nstate the law fairly and distinctly and must not mislead the jury or prejudice a party.” (Internal\n\nquotation marks omitted.) Doe v. University of Chicago Medical Center, 2014 IL App (1st)\n\n121593, ¶ 77, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The only contested legal issue for the jury to determine regarding\n\nplaintiff’s pretext theory—whether defendant failed to rehire plaintiff because of her race or\n\nreligion—was not provided to the jury. The failure to include this component in the elements\n\ninstruction was both inaccurate and misleading. Given that we do not know which theory of\n\nliability the jury relied upon when it found in plaintiff’s favor, we conclude the failure to provide\n\nsuch an instruction was prejudicial to defendant. That plaintiff argues her instructions already\n\ncontained more issues of proof than necessary is unpersuasive, as the jury was deprived of an\n\ninstruction regarding the critical issue of causation. Regardless of the evidence, the fact that the\n\njury was not provided with the correct instructions regarding the law requires reversal.\n\n\n\n                                                 - 15 -\n\f¶ 54                             3. Motivating-Factor Instruction\n\n¶ 55           Although we have already determined plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16\n\ninaccurately stated the law, thus requiring remand for a new trial, we address the remaining\n\nissues with the jury instructions as they are likely to arise again on remand.

Pielet, 2012\n\nIL 112064, ¶ 56, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n¶ 56           The portion of the instructions regarding the motivating-factor language stated:\n\n                       “In the alternative, Plaintiff must prove by a preponderance\n\n               of the evidence that her race [religion] was a motivating factor in\n\n               Defendant’s decision not to rehire her. A motivating factor is\n\n               something that contributed to Defendant’s decision.\n\n                       If you find that Plaintiff has proven that her race [religion]\n\n               contributed to Defendants’ decision not to rehire her, you must\n\n               then decide whether Defendant proved by a preponderance of the\n\n               evidence that it would not have rehired her even if Plaintiff was not\n\n               Causasian [was Pentecostal]. If so, you must enter a verdict for the\n\n               Plaintiff but you may not award her damages.”\n\nThis addition to plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 cited 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions,\n\nCivil, No. 3.01. According to the Committee Comments, Instruction No. 3.01 is based on the\n\ncase of Gehring v.

Pattern Jury\n\nInstructions, Civil, No. 3.01, Committee Comments (2005 rev.) However, the language in\n\nplaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16 does not mirror the language included in 7th Cir. Pattern\n\nJury Instructions, Civil, No. 3.01. Rather, the language used by plaintiff comes from a\n\nrecommendation in the Committee Comments based on the reasoning used by other circuits\n\n\n\n                                                - 16 -\n\fwhen the plaintiff asserts the defendant had a “mixed motive” for terminating the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment or failing to rehire the plaintiff. The committee comment concludes by saying,\n\n“Without clear guidance in the circuit case law, the Committee cannot offer assistance in\n\ndetermining when a ‘mixed motive’ instruction is appropriate.” 7th Cir. Pattern Jury Instructions,\n\nCivil, No. 3.01, Committee Comments (2005 rev.).\n\n¶ 57           That being said, Illinois courts do recognize the mixed-motive method of\n\ndetermining discrimination.

The question is whether plaintiff met the standard for\n\nestablishing defendant’s decision was based on a mixed motive in order to tender such a jury\n\ninstruction.\n\n¶ 58           The legal concepts of pretext and mixed motive are not interchangeable. Unlike\n\npretext, wherein the plaintiff may rely on indirect evidence of discrimination, “to use the mixed-\n\nmotive method, the plaintiff must show direct evidence that decisionmakers placed substantial\n\nnegative reliance on an illegitimate criterion in reaching their decision.” (Internal quotations\n\nmarks omitted.) Id. at 1124, 759 N.E.2d at 46. The employee’s evidence must do more than\n\ncreate an inference of discrimination; rather, it must establish a clear nexus between the\n\nemployer’s reliance on an impermissible factor and its subsequent decision to discharge the\n\nemployee.

Moreover, plaintiff’s case did not rest on the allegation that defendant’s motives were\n\nboth legitimate and illegitimate; plaintiff vehemently denied engaging in the misbehavior cited\n\nby defendant as the reason for her termination. Rather, plaintiff’s theory of the case was that\n\ndefendant’s reason for not rehiring her was based solely on pretext, which allows the plaintiff to\n\nrely on indirect evidence. Id. at 1123, 759 N.E.2d at 45.\n\n¶ 60           Because plaintiff failed to present evidence that defendant’s reason for\n\nterminating her was based on a mixed motive, it was erroneous for the trial court to give such an\n\ninstruction.\n\n¶ 61                             D. Plaintiff’s Instruction No. 17\n\n¶ 62           Defendant next asserts the trial court erred by allowing plaintiff’s instruction No.\n\n17, based on an unpublished district court case, Woods, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2062400</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. During the\n\ninstruction conference, plaintiff represented the proposed instruction was given in the Woods\n\ncase. The instruction read:\n\n                       “You must decide whether Defendant discriminated against\n\n               Plaintiff because of her race or religion. The fact that Defendant\n\n               may have treated some Caucasians or non-Pentecostal employees\n\n               favorably does not immunize it from liability in this case. In other\n\n               words, you may find Defendant discriminated against Plaintiff\n\n               even though Defendant did not discriminate against other\n\n               Caucasian or non-Pentecostal employees.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 18 -\n\f¶ 63           Given Woods is devoid of any discussion of the use of the above instruction,\n\nciting Woods to the trial court seems questionable. However, plaintiff’s instruction does contain\n\nan accurate statement of law. In Connecticut v. Teal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110751\"><a href=\"/opinion/110751/connecticut-v-teal/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 455 (1982), the Supreme\n\nCourt concluded Title VII “never intended to give an employer license to discriminate against\n\nsome employees on the basis of race or sex merely because he favorably treats other members of\n\nthe employees’ group.” Rather, the statute was written for the “protection of the individual\n\nemployee, rather than the protection of a minority group as a whole.” Id. at 453-54. Although the\n\nparties point to no published Illinois cases that include this statement in their jury instructions,\n\nthat does not make the statement inaccurate. The Act contains the same framework as that\n\ncontained in Title VII, and we analyze cases under the Act according to Supreme Court decisions\n\nbased on Title VII. Chicago Housing Authority, 325 Ill. App. 3d at 1123, 759 N.E.2d at 45. The\n\nTeal case stands for the proposition stated in plaintiff’s instruction No. 17: “The fact that\n\nDefendant may have treated some Caucasians or non-Pentecostal employees favorably does not\n\nimmunize it from liability in this case.” Accordingly, we conclude this instruction contains an\n\naccurate statement of the law and the trial court properly tendered it to the jury.\n\n¶ 64           We note the first line of the instruction, however, would be redundant once the\n\nelements instructions (plaintiff’s instruction Nos. 15 and 16) are corrected.
