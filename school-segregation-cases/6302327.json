With\nhim on the Plaintiff’s Second Supplemental Reply Memorandum was Helena D. Sullivan.\n\nMonica P. Triana, Trial Attorney, Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, U.S. Department\nof Justice, of Washington, DC, argued for defendant. With her on the brief were Benjamin C.\nMizer, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and Amy M. Rubin, Assistant Director. Of\ncounsel was Beth C. Brotman, Office of the Chief Counsel for Trade Enforcement & Compliance,\nU.S. Department of Commerce, of Washington, DC.\n\n         Katzmann, Judge: Catching sight of three tiny orphaned kittens wandering in a battlefield\n\ntent, President Abraham Lincoln directed Colonel Bowers of General Grant’s staff: “Colonel, I\n\nhope you will see that these poor little motherless waifs are given plenty of milk and treated\n\nkindly.” 1 Some eighty years later, President Harry Truman is famously said to have remarked, “[i]f\n\n\n\n\n1\n  CARL SANDBURG, ABRAHAM LINCOLN: THE WAR YEARS, Vol. IV (1939), p. 146. Sandburg\nrecounts that Lincoln picked up one of the three kittens and asked, “‘Where is your mother?’\nSomeone answered, ‘The mother is dead.’ And as he petted the little one: ‘Then she can’t grieve\nas many a poor mother is grieving for a son lost in battle.’” Id. General Porter observed Lincoln\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 2\n\n\nyou want a friend in Washington, get a dog.” 2           It would certainly have been beyond the\n\ncontemplation of the 16th or 33rd Presidents that their animals might be categorized as items or\n\npersonal effects. Yet, the determination of that categorization under the domestic tariff scheme is\n\ncentral to the question presented by the case before this court: how should cloth pet carriers be\n\nclassified for the purposes of determining what tariff rate should apply to their importation?\n\n         In this action, Plaintiff Quaker Pet Group, LLC (“Quaker Pet”) contests the denials of its\n\nadministrative protests by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“Customs”) and disputes the tariff\n\nclassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (2012) (“HTSUS”) 3\n\nwhich Customs determined for five of its pet carrier products. Specifically, Quaker Pet contends\n\nthat pets are not “personal effects” and therefore the pet carriers -- cloth and mesh carrying bags\n\nused for transporting pets -- are classifiable under the residual provision for textile articles, HTSUS\n\nheading 6307, carrying a duty rate of seven percent. The United States (“the Government”) argues\n\nthat Customs correctly classified the pet carriers under the HTSUS heading 4202, which covers\n\ntravel, sports, and similar bags, and carries a 17.6 percent duty rate. Pl.’s Statement of Undisputed\n\n\n\n\nfondling the kittens. “He would wipe their eyes tenderly with his handkerchief, stroke their smooth\ncoats, and listen to them purring their gratitude to him.” Id.\n2\n  In a variant of the phrase, Nancy Kassebaum, then Senator from Kansas, wrote in a 1987 letter\nto the New York Times: “I’ll close with some words from Harry Truman: ‘If you want a friend\nin Washington, buy a dog.’” Prospects, N.Y. TIMES, June 7, 1987. In fact, there is some debate as\nto the authenticity of the Truman quote. See RALPH KEYES, THE QUOTE VERIFIER 47 (New York:\nSt. Martin’s Griffin, New York, 2006). However, the sentiment’s durability is unquestionable.\nSee, e.g., CATHERINE SINCLAIR, MODERN FLIRTATIONS: OR, A MONTH AT HARROWGATE (1841)\n(“As Lord Byron said, ‘nobody need want a friend who can get a dog.’”); LORD BYRON, EPITAPH\nTO A DOG (1808) (“But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend / The first to welcome, foremost to\ndefend[.]”).\n3\n All references to section notes, chapter notes, headings or subheadings contained herein are to\n2012 HTSUS.\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                        Page 3\n\n\nFacts ¶¶ 12–13, Sept. 18, 2015, ECF No. 21 (“Pl.’s Fact Statement”); Answer to Pl.’s Amended\n\nCompl. ¶ 10, Apr. 27, 2015, ECF. No. 13 (“Def.’s Answer”). Before the court is Quaker Pet’s\n\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Count I of its Amended Complaint, and its\n\nmemorandum in support of the motion (“Pl.’s Br.”). The court concludes that the pet carriers are\n\nnot, as a matter of law, classifiable under heading 4202. However, the relevant record is not\n\nsufficiently developed yet for the court to determine whether the products are classifiable under\n\nheading 6307. Thus, Quaker Pet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted in part and\n\ndenied in part, and the parties are directed to file a proposed schedule for future proceedings.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n                                 I.      The Merchandise at Issue 4\n\n         The imported merchandise consist of five styles of pet carriers. Amended Compl. ¶ 5, Feb.\n\n12, 2015, ECF No. 7; Def.’s Answer ¶ 5. Pet carrier style numbers 55234, 55534, 97009, and\n\n98791 were imported into Newark, NJ, and style number 94279 was imported into Long Beach,\n\nCA from China. Amended Compl. ¶¶ 6–7; Def.’s Answer ¶¶ 6–7. These pet carriers are used to\n\ncarry cats, dogs, or other pets. Amended Compl. ¶ 8; Def.’s Answer ¶ 8. Subsequent to the\n\ncommencement of this action, Quaker Pet, the importer of record, was sold to Worldwise, Inc.\n\nLetter from Plaintiff’s Counsel, ECF No. 61. Worldwise has continued to import the same pet\n\ncarriers, typically under the SherpaTM brand trademark. Id.\n\n\n\n\n4\n  Plaintiff also submitted, pursuant to mandatory disclosures and attached as Exhibits A and B to\nits motion here, a physical sample and third party marketing materials. However, in the context\nof this motion for judgment on the pleadings, the court is not considering those materials in\nreaching its decision. See USCIT Rule 12(c), (d) (“If, on a motion [for judgment on the pleadings]\nunder Rule . . . 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court,\nthe motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”).\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                        Page 4\n\n\n                                       II.     Procedural History\n\n          Quaker Pet challenges the classification and liquidation of the subject pet carriers under\n\nsubheading 4202.92.30 5 of the HTSUS, the provision covering traveling bags and similar\n\ncontainers of textile material. Amended Compl. ¶ 10; Def.’s Answer ¶ 10. As noted, this\n\nclassification carries a 17.6 percent duty rate. HTSUS 4202.92.30. Quaker Pet -- believing the\n\npet carriers are classifiable under HTSUS subheading 6307.90.98, ‘Other made up articles,\n\nincluding dress patterns:…Other:…Other,” 6 which carries a duty rate of seven percent -- contested\n\nthe liquidations by filing a protest on April 25, 2013. Summons, Dec. 9, 2013, ECF No. 1.\n\nCustoms denied the protest on June 21, 2013, and this action followed. Id. Initial disclosures were\n\nserved on January 21, 2015 and supplemented on July 17, 2015. Def.’s Br. at Exhibits 1–2. Quaker\n\nPet moved for judgment on the pleadings as to Count I of its Amended Complaint on September\n\n18, 2015, and the Government filed its response on October 30, 2015. Pl.’s Br.; Def.’s Br. Quaker\n\n\n5\n    HTSUS 4202.92.30 covers:\n              Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attaché cases, briefcases, school\n              satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases, camera cases, musical\n              instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers;\n              traveling bags, insulated food or beverage bags, toiletry bags,\n              knapsacks and backpacks, handbags, shopping bags, wallets, purses,\n              map cases, cigarette cases, tobacco pouches, tool bags, sports bags,\n              bottle cases, jewelry boxes, powder cases, cutlery cases and similar\n              containers, of leather or of composition leather, of sheeting of\n              plastics, of textile materials, of vulcanized fiber or of paperboard, or\n              wholly or mainly covered with such materials or with paper:…\n                      With outer surface of sheeting of plastic or of textile\n              materials:...\n                               Other…\n6\n  This argument constitutes Quaker Pet’s first Count. See Amended Compl. ¶ 11. In Count II,\nQuaker Pet argues that “[i]n the alternative, the imported pet carriers are properly classified under\nsubheading 4201.00.30, HTSUS, dutiable at the rate of 2.4% ad valorem, as: ‘Saddlery and harness\nfor any animal (including traces, leads, knee pads, muzzles, saddle cloths, saddle bags, dog coats\nand the like), of any material: Dog leashes, collars, muzzles, harnesses and similar dog\nequipment.’” Id. ¶13.\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                      Page 5\n\n\nPet filed its reply on November 12, 2015, and the first oral argument was held on February 11,\n\n2016.

Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n\n         The Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(a) (2012), according to\n\nwhich the court has jurisdiction over an action brought under section 515 of the Tariff Act of 1930\n\nas amended, 19 U.S.C. § 1515 (2012) to contest a denial of a protest by Customs. 7\n\n         In a tariff classification case, the Court proceeds de novo. Park B. Smith, Ltd. v. United\n\nStates, 347 F.3d 922, 924 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see Customs Courts Act of 1980 § 301, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2640(a)(1)(2012) (directing the Court of International Trade to review classification rulings on\n\n“the basis of the record made before the court”).        The Court first considers whether “the\n\n\n\n7\n Further citations to the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, are to the relevant provision of Title 19\nof the U.S. Code, 2012 edition.\n\f Court No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 6\n\n\ngovernment’s classification is correct, both independently and in comparison with the importer’s\n\nalternative.” Value Vinyls, Inc. v. United States, 568 F.3d 1374, 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2009);\n\nJarvis Clark Co. v. United States, 733 F.2d 873, 878 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The plaintiff has the burden\n\nof showing the government’s determined classification to be incorrect. Park B. Smith, 347 F.3d\n\nat 925; Jarvis, 733 F.2d at 876. If the plaintiff meets that burden, the Court has an independent\n\nduty to arrive at “the correct result, by whatever procedure is best suited to the case at hand.”\n\nValue Vinyls, 568 F.3d at 1377 (citing Jarvis, 733 F.2d at 878) (emphasis in original).\n\n        While the Court accords respect to Customs’ classification rulings relative to their “power\n\nto persuade,” United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 235 (2001) (citing Skidmore v. Swift &\n\nCo., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)), the Court also has “an independent responsibility to decide the\n\nlegal issue of the proper meaning and scope of HTSUS terms.” Wilton Indus., Inc. v. United States,\n\n741 F.3d 1263, 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (citing Warner-Lambert Co. v. United States, 407 F.3d 1207,\n\n1209 (Fed. Cir. 2005)).\n\n                          II.   Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12\n\n       A party may move for judgment on the pleadings “after the pleadings are closed--but early\n\nenough not to delay trial.” USCIT Rule 12(c). A Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings\n\nis reviewed under the same standard as a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state\n\na claim. See Forest Labs., Inc. v. United States, 29 CIT 1401, 1402–03, 403 F. Supp. 2d 1348,\n\n1349 (2005), aff’d, 476 F.3d 877 (Fed. Cir. 2007). USCIT Rule 12(b)(6) parallels Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Compare USCIT R. 12(b)(6) with Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6). In deciding such a motion, the court assumes all factual allegations to be true\n\nand draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. See Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416\n\nU.S. 232, 236 (1974); Cedars–Sinai Med. Ctr. v. Watkins, 11 F.3d 1573, 1584 n.13 (Fed. Cir.\n\f Court No. 13-00393                                                                              Page 7\n\n\n1993); Gould, Inc. v. United States, 935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1991). A plaintiff’s factual\n\nallegations must be “enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption\n\nthat all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).” Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007). “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain\n\nsufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim of relief that is plausible on its face.’”\n\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). The court may\n\nnot rely on matters outside the pleadings unless it also treats the motion as one for summary\n\njudgment under USCIT Rule 56. See USCIT Rule 7(a), 12(d), 56.\n\n   III.         Tariff Classification under the General Rules of Interpretation HTSUS\n\n          “In a classification case, the court construes the relevant (competing) classification\n\nheadings, a question of law; determines what the merchandise at issue is, a question of fact; and\n\nthen determines ‘the proper classification under which [the merchandise] falls, the ultimate\n\nquestion in every classification case and one that has always been treated as a question of law.’”\n\nBausch & Lomb, 148 F.3d at 1366; see Wilton Indus., 741 F.3d at 1266. When there is no factual\n\ndispute regarding the merchandise, the resolution of the classification issue turns on the first step,\n\ndetermining the proper meaning and scope of the relevant tariff provisions. See Wilton Indus.,\n\n741 F.3d at 1266–67; Carl Zeiss, 195 F.3d at 1378; Bausch & Lomb, 148 F.3d at 1365–66.\n\n          “The HTSUS scheme is organized by headings, each of which has one or more\n\nsubheadings; the headings set forth general categories of merchandise, and the subheadings\n\nprovide a more particularized segregation of the goods within each category.” Alcan Food\n\nPackaging (Shelbyville) v. United States, 773 F.3d 1364, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting Wilton\n\nIndus., 741 F.3d at 1266). The Court considers chapter and section notes of the HTSUS in\n\nresolving classification disputes because they are statutory law, not interpretative rules. See Arko\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                          Page 8\n\n\nFoods Intern., Inc. v. United States, 654 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). As\n\nsuch, they are binding on the Court. See Park B. Smith, Ltd., 347 F.3d at 929.\n\n         Tariff classification is determined according to the General Rules of Interpretation\n\n(“GRIs”), and, if applicable, the Additional U.S. Rules of Interpretation (“ARIs”). The “General\n\nRules of Interpretation govern classification of merchandise under the HTSUS, and are applied in\n\nnumerical order.” Honda of Am. Mfg. v. United States, 607 F.3d 771, 773 (Fed. Cir. 2010)\n\n(internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n         Under GRI 1, “classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings\n\nand any relative section or chapter notes.” 8 See Faus Grp., Inc. v. United States, 581 F.3d 1369,\n\n1372 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (citing Orlando Food Corp. v. United States, 140 F.3d 1437, 1440 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1998)). Unless there is evidence of “contrary legislative intent, HTSUS terms are to be construed\n\naccording to their common and commercial meanings.” La Crosse Tech., Ltd. v. United States,\n\n723 F.3d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2013); Russell Stadelman & Co. v. United States, 242 F.3d 1044,\n\n1048 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In ascertaining a term’s common meaning, the court may “consult\n\nlexicographic and scientific authorities, dictionaries, and other reliable information” or may rely\n\non its “own understanding of the terms used.” Baxter Healthcare Corp. v.

Although the court is\n\nunpersuaded that Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1 necessarily excludes Quaker Pet’s products\n\nfrom Chapter 42, the court concludes as a matter of law that the products are not properly\n\nclassifiable under heading 4202 according to Federal Circuit precedent. However, the relevant\n\n\n\n\n9\n This case need not proceed beyond GRI 1, as discussed below, and so further discussion of GRI\n2 and GRI 3 is unnecessary.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                        Page 10\n\n\nrecord is not sufficiently developed yet for the court to determine whether the products are\n\nclassifiable under heading 6307.\n\n   I.    Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1 Does Not Automatically Exclude Quaker Pet’s\n                                   Products from Chapter 42.\n        Applying GRI 1, the court first considers the language of the relevant headings and any\n\napplicable chapter or section notes. See Faus Grp., 581 at 1372 (citing Orlando Food Corp., 140\n\nF.3d at 1440). By its terms, heading 4202 covers:\n\n               Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attaché cases, briefcases, school\n               satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases, camera cases, musical\n               instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers;\n               traveling bags, insulated food or beverage bags, toiletry bags,\n               knapsacks and backpacks, handbags, shopping bags, wallets, purses,\n               map cases, cigarette cases, tobacco pouches, tool bags, sports bags,\n               bottle cases, jewelry boxes, powder cases, cutlery cases and similar\n               containers, of leather or of composition leather, of sheeting of\n               plastics, of textile materials, of vulcanized fiber or of paperboard, or\n               wholly or mainly covered with such materials or with paper:…\n\n\nHTSUS 4202. HTSUS Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, further provides that “the expression\n\n‘travel, sports and similar bags’ means goods, other than those falling in subheadings 4202.11\n\nthrough 4202.39, of a kind designed for carrying clothing and other personal effects during travel,\n\nincluding backpacks and shopping bags of this heading, but does not include binocular cases,\n\ncamera cases, musical instrument cases, bottle cases and similar containers.” HTSUS Chapter 42,\n\nAdditional U.S. Note 1. Pets are not clothing, and thus whether pet carriers fall within “travel,\n\nsport and similar bags” depends on whether pets are “personal effects.”\n\n        HTSUS does not define “personal effects.” To ascertain the meaning of “personal effects,”\n\nthe court may “consult lexicographic and scientific authorities, dictionaries, and other reliable\n\ninformation” or may rely on its “own understanding of the terms used.” Baxter Healthcare Corp.,\n\n182 F.3d at 1337–38; see Millennium Lumber, 558 F.3d at 1328–29 (citation omitted); Carl Zeiss,\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                          Page 11\n\n\n195 F.3d at 1379 (citation omitted). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,\n\n(3rd Ed., 1992 at page 1351) defines personal effects as “[p]rivately owned items, such as keys,\n\nan identification card, or a wallet or watch, that are regularly worn or carried on one’s person.”\n\nOther dictionaries provide nearly identical definitions. See Random House Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language, (2nd Ed. unabridged at page 1445) (“privately owned articles consisting chiefly\n\nof clothing, toilet items, etc., for intimate use by an individual”); Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate\n\nDictionary, (1986 at page 877) (“privately owned items (as clothing and toilet articles) normally\n\nworn or carried on the person”). Dogs and cats are not normally worn or carried on the person,\n\nnor are they similar inanimate objects “such as keys, an identification card, or a wallet or watch.”\n\n       The Government argues that Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, is irrelevant to the court’s\n\nclassification decision, because “[w]hether or not a product may fit within particular subheadings\n\nor heading 4202 is not dispositive of whether it could fall anywhere within the heading” and that\n\n“[o]nly after determining that a product is classifiable under the heading should the court look to\n\nthe subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise.” Def.’s Br. at 15 (citing\n\nOrlando Food Corp., 140 F.3d at 1440).\n\n       The court is required to “first construe[] the nature of the heading, and any section or\n\nchapter notes in question, to determine whether the product at issue is classifiable under the\n\nheading.” Orlando Food Corp., 140 F.3d at 1440. Although Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1\n\nmentions some specific subheadings, that fact does not preclude the court from considering the\n\ndefinition this chapter note provides at the GRI 1 stage. 10\n\n\n\n\n10\n Further, the Government presents no authority that supports ignoring a chapter note because it\nmentions specific subheadings. Indeed, the subheadings mentioned in Chapter 42, Additional U.S.\nNote 1, simply do not contain the term “travel, sports and similar bags” defined by that Note. See\nHTSUS 4202.11–.39.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 12\n\n\n       The Government also argues that pets are personal property or “effects” of their owners\n\nand thus are “personal effects” for the purposes of HTSUS classification, and cites several cases\n\nin support of this contention. Def.’s Br. at 15 (citing Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 270\n\n(1st Cir. 2009) (discussing dogs as property or “effects” for purposes of the Fourth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments); Altman v. City of High Point, 330 F.3d 194, 203–05 (4th Cir. 2003) (holding that\n\ndogs are considered personal property or “effects” under the Fourth Amendment); Schrage v.\n\nHatzlacha Cab Corp., 13 A.D.3d 150, *1 (1st Dep’t N.Y.S. 2004) (discussing dogs as personal\n\nproperty for the purposes of New York state law)). The Government further cites Social Security\n\nAdministration (“SSA”) documents explicitly including pets in the definition of personal effects\n\nfor the purposes of determining Supplemental Security Income benefits. Def.’s Br. at 15 (citing\n\nSSA:     Program      Operations      Manual      System,     SI    01130.430,      available     at\n\nhttps://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501130430).\n\n       The court finds this argument unpersuasive. First, the court notes that none of these sources\n\nassess the definition of personal effects under the HTSUS or relate to the HTSUS at all. Further,\n\nthe cases do not address whether dogs are personal effects, but instead whether they are personal\n\nproperty or effects. “Personal property” and “effects” 11 cover a much broader range of property\n\nthan “personal effects,” which is limited to property normally worn or carried on the person, as\n\ndiscussed above. Thus, the cases do not provide any guidance on the common or commercial\n\nmeaning of the term “personal effects” in the context of HTSUS heading 4202. Additionally,\n\nalthough the SSA documents do define “personal effects,” the definitions cited therein are\n\n\n\n\n11\n  The definitions of “personal property” and “effects” are property “consisting in general of things\ntemporary or movable including intangible property” and “movable property,” respectively.\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary at 724, 1687.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                             Page 13\n\n\nregulatory definitions in the context of personal property, and are not relevant to the common or\n\ncommercial meaning of the term “personal effects” for purposes of HTSUS heading 4202.\n\n           Even though a pet is not a personal effect -- and therefore, the pet carriers are not similar\n\nto a travel or sport bag -- that does not automatically exclude the pet carriers from heading 4202,\n\nas the pet carriers could be similar to another type of bag explicitly listed, such as a suitcase.\n\n     II.    The Avenues In Leather Test Does Exclude Quaker Pet’s Products from Chapter\n                                                42.\n           The court next turns to the Federal Circuit’s Avenues In Leather test for determining\n\nwhether something is classifiable under heading 4202: 12 “the common characteristic or unifying\n\npurpose of the goods in heading 4202 consist[s] of organizing, storing, protecting, and carrying\n\nvarious items.” Avenues In Leather, Inc. v. United States, 423 F.3d 1326, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2005)\n\n(emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n           As a threshold question, the court considers whether pets are items. An “item” is defined\n\nas “an individual thing (as an article of household goods, an article of apparel, an object in an art\n\ncollection, a book in a library) singled out from an aggregate of individual things (as those being\n\nenumerated in a bill or inventory or similar list).” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n\nat 1203. A “thing” is defined as “an inanimate object as distinguished from a living being.” Id. at\n\n\n\n\n12\n   Although not binding law, courts also look to the Explanatory Notes (“ENs”) to the Harmonized\nCommodity Description and Coding System, maintained by the World Customs Organization, as\npersuasive authority on how to interpret and apply HTSUS provisions. See Home Depot, 491 F.3d\nat 1336 (“Although the Explanatory Notes ‘do not constitute controlling legislative history,’ they\nare nonetheless intended to offer guidance in clarifying the scope of HTSUS subheadings.” (citing\nMita Copystar Am. v. United States, 21 F.3d 1079, 1082 (Fed. Cir. 1994))); Deckers Outdoor\nCorp. v. United States, 714 F.3d 1363, 1367 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2013); see generally Alcan Food\nPackaging (Shelbyville) v. United States, 37 CIT ___, 929 F. Supp. 2d 1338 (2013) (relying\nextensively on the guidance provided by the ENs to resolve the case under GRI 1), aff’d, 771 F.3d\n1364 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The ENs to HTSUS Chapter 42, however, do not provide guidance relevant\nto the issue at hand, and so do not factor into the court’s analysis here.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                          Page 14\n\n\n2376. Pets are living beings, and thus not things or items. Therefore, the pet carriers in question\n\ndo not fulfill the criteria propounded in the Avenues In Leather case for classification under\n\nheading 4202.\n\n       At oral argument, the Government contended that the common characteristic or unifying\n\npurpose of the goods in heading 4202 was only to organize, store, protect, and carry; that “items”\n\nwas merely a placeholder word for whatever heading 4202 containers organized, stored, protected,\n\nand carried; and that to consider “items” part of the common characteristic of the goods in heading\n\n4202 would impose a distinction between animate and inanimate objects that the Federal Circuit\n\ndid not intend and that had no basis in the tariff heading. Oral Argument. The court finds this\n\nreasoning unpersuasive. The Government offers no compelling reason to conclude that the Federal\n\nCircuit’s choice of the word “items” was any less deliberate than its choice of “organizing, storing,\n\nprotecting, and carrying” when articulating the common characteristic or unifying purpose of the\n\ngoods in heading 4202. Further, the distinction between animate and inanimate objects is\n\nsupported by the tariff heading itself: all exemplar goods listed in heading 4202 are designed to\n\ncontain inanimate objects and not living beings. HTSUS 4202; see also Firstrax, 2011 WL\n\n5024271, at *9 (“On their face, exemplars listed in heading 4202 store and/or contain inanimate\n\nobjects of personal property, not living, breathing animals.”).\n\n       The Government also contends that, although the pet carriers do indeed carry pets, other\n\nobjects could be placed in the side pockets of Quaker Pet’s products, and thus it is still proper to\n\nclassify the pet carriers under heading 4202. Def.’s Br. at 9–11. However,\n\n                It is well settled that when a list of items is followed by a general\n                word or phrase, the rule of ejusdem generis 13 is used to determine\n\n\n13\n   Ejusdem generis is a “canon of construction holding that when a general word or phrase follows\na list of specifics, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only items of the same\nclass as those listed.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 15\n\n\n               the scope of the general word or phrase. In classification cases,\n               ejusdem generis requires that, for any imported merchandise to fall\n               within the scope of the general term or phrase, the merchandise must\n               possess the same essential characteristics or purposes that unite the\n               listed exemplars preceding the general term or phrase. However, a\n               classification under the ejusdem generis principle is inappropriate\n               when an imported article has a specific and primary purpose that is\n               inconsistent with that of the listed exemplars in a particular heading.\n\nAvenues In Leather, 423 F.3d at 1332 (internal citations omitted). Here, the pet carriers’ primary\n\npurpose is to carry living beings -- pets. Amended Compl. ¶ 8; Def.’s Answer ¶ 8. As discussed\n\nabove, this primary purpose is inconsistent with the purpose of the exemplars in heading 4202,\n\nwhich is to organize, store, protect, and carry various inanimate objects. Avenues In Leather, 423\n\nF.3d at 1332; see also HTSUS 4202 (listing containers only designed for use holding inanimate\n\nobjects). Thus, the possibility of placing some objects in the side pockets does not entail that the\n\npet carriers are properly classifiable under heading 4202.\n\n    III.   The Record Is Not Yet Sufficiently Developed for the Court to Determine the\n                               Proper Heading for the Products.\n\n       Continuing the GRI 1 analysis, the court turns to whether the pet carriers are classifiable\n\nunder heading 6307, which covers “Other made up articles, including dress patterns” of textile.\n\nHTSUS 6307. Specifically, heading 6307 includes “made up textile articles of any textile fabric\n\n(woven or knitted fabric, felt, nonwovens, etc.) which are not more specifically described in other\n\nChapters of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature.” Chapter 63, Explanatory Notes\n\n(emphasis in original). “Made up” is defined by the HTSUS as “[a]ssembled by sewing, gumming\n\nor otherwise (other than piece goods consisting of two or more lengths of identical material joined\n\nend to end and piece goods composed of two or more textiles assembled in layers, whether or not\n\npadded).” HTSUS Section XI, Note 7(e). Under the HTSUS, textiles include fabrics made from\n\nman-made fibers and filaments, including polyethylene. See HTSUS Chapter 54.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                              Page 16\n\n\n        The Government contends that Quaker Pet has not established that the pet carriers can be\n\nclassified under heading 6307 because “there is no evidence in the record as to the ‘predominant\n\nmaterial’ for the five styles of pet carriers at issue, nor any legal analysis as to the relevance of the\n\n‘predominant material.’” Def.’s Br. at 16. The court notes that Quaker Pet is not required to\n\nestablish the correct classification heading: the plaintiff only has the burden of showing the\n\ngovernment’s determined classification to be incorrect. Park B. Smith, 347 F.3d at 925; Jarvis,\n\n733 F.2d at 876. If the plaintiff meets that burden, the Court has an independent duty to arrive at\n\n“the correct result, by whatever procedure is best suited to the case at hand.” Value Vinyls, 568\n\nF.3d at 1377 (citing Jarvis, 733 F.2d at 878) (emphasis in original). However, the undisputed facts\n\ncontained in the pleadings do not provide sufficient information -- for example, the materials\n\ncomprising each style of pet carrier or any procedure through which the products were assembled\n\nor otherwise made up -- for the court to determine whether the pet carriers are properly classifiable\n\nunder HTSUS heading 6307 or another heading. 14\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Quaker Pet contends that the materials it provided as part of mandatory disclosures -- which\ninclude third party marketing materials for each of the pet carrier styles and a sample of one of the\nstyles of pet carrier -- establish that the pet carriers belong in heading 6307. Pl.’s Br. at Exhibit A,\nExhibit B. However, as previously noted supra n.4, the court does not consider the mandatory\ndisclosures as part of ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Quaker Pet further\nsuggests that, under USCIT Rule 12, the court could convert this motion into a motion for summary\njudgment. USCIT Rule 12 (“If, on a motion [for judgment on the pleadings] under Rule . . . 12(c),\nmatters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be\ntreated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”). The court declines to use its discretion to\nconvert this motion on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment, as the Government has\nnot been given sufficient opportunity to present material pertinent to a summary judgment motion.\nSee USCIT Rule 12(d) (“All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the\nmaterial that is pertinent to the motion.”). All briefing and oral argument up to this stage have\naddressed only Quaker Pet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and thus the Government has\nnot had an adequate opportunity to develop the record and present arguments related to a motion\nfor summary judgment.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                            Page 17\n\n\n             IV.     The Court Grants the Pending Motion to Withdraw Count II\n\n        In addition to the motion for the judgment on the pleadings, Quaker Pet also filed a Motion\n\nto Withdraw Count II of the Amended Complaint. ECF No. 57. In Count II, see supra n.6, Quaker\n\nPet claimed, in the alternative, that if the court did not find that the pet carriers were classifiable\n\nunder HTSUS heading 6307, they would be classifiable under heading 4201.00.30 (“Harness and\n\nsaddlery for any animal (including traces, leads, knee pads, muzzles, saddle cloths, saddle bags,\n\ndog coats, and the like) of any material: Dog leases, collars, muzzles, harnesses and similar dog\n\nequipment.”). Amended Compl. ¶¶ 12–13. The Government does not consent to this motion\n\n“because this case is designated as a test case, and we believe that all classification claims should\n\nbe address in this action in order to promote efficient adjudication of the suspended cases.” Resp.\n\nto Motion to Withdraw Count II of the Amended Compl., 1–2, ECF No. 59. However, the court\n\nhas an independent duty to evaluate all potential HTSUS classifications, and so withdrawing Count\n\nII will not prevent the court from considering heading 4201 and any other potentially relevant\n\nheadings when ruling on Count I. Value Vinyls, 568 F.3d at 1377 (citing Jarvis, 733 F.2d at 878).\n\nThe court thus grants Quaker Pet’s Motion to Withdraw Count II.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        Given that the pet carriers’ primary purpose is to carry pets and not items, they are excluded\n\nas a matter of law from heading 4202. However, the undisputed facts contained in the pleadings\n\ndo not provide enough information for the court to determine the proper classification for the\n\nproducts.\n\n        Accordingly, it is hereby\n\n        ORDERED that Quaker Pet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings be granted in part and\n\ndenied in part; and it is further\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                    Page 18\n\n\n        ORDERED that within two weeks of the date of this Opinion, the parties shall file a\n\nproposed schedule for further proceedings consistent with this opinion;\n\n        ORDERED that Quaker Pet’s motion to withdraw count II of the amended complaint be\n\ngranted; and it is further\n\n        ORDERED that count II of the amended complaint shall be withdrawn.\n\n                                                            /s/ Gary S.

Sandburg\nrecounts that Lincoln picked up one of the three kittens and asked, “‘Where is your mother?’\nSomeone answered, ‘The mother is dead.’ And as he petted the little one: ‘Then she can’t grieve\nas many a poor mother is grieving for a son lost in battle.’” Id. General Porter observed Lincoln\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 2\n\n\nyou want a friend in Washington, get a dog.” 2           It would certainly have been beyond the\n\ncontemplation of the 16th or 33rd Presidents that their animals might be categorized as items or\n\npersonal effects. Yet, the determination of that categorization under the domestic tariff scheme is\n\ncentral to the question presented by the case before this court: how should cloth pet carriers be\n\nclassified for the purposes of determining what tariff rate should apply to their importation?\n\n         In this action, Plaintiff Quaker Pet Group, LLC (“Quaker Pet”) contests the denials of its\n\nadministrative protests by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“Customs”) and disputes the tariff\n\nclassification under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (2012) (“HTSUS”) 3\n\nwhich Customs determined for five of its pet carrier products. Specifically, Quaker Pet contends\n\nthat pets are not “personal effects” and therefore the pet carriers -- cloth and mesh carrying bags\n\nused for transporting pets -- are classifiable under the residual provision for textile articles, HTSUS\n\nheading 6307, carrying a duty rate of seven percent. The United States (“the Government”) argues\n\nthat Customs correctly classified the pet carriers under the HTSUS heading 4202, which covers\n\ntravel, sports, and similar bags, and carries a 17.6 percent duty rate. Pl.’s Statement of Undisputed\n\n\n\n\nfondling the kittens. “He would wipe their eyes tenderly with his handkerchief, stroke their smooth\ncoats, and listen to them purring their gratitude to him.” Id.\n2\n  In a variant of the phrase, Nancy Kassebaum, then Senator from Kansas, wrote in a 1987 letter\nto the New York Times: “I’ll close with some words from Harry Truman: ‘If you want a friend\nin Washington, buy a dog.’” Prospects, N.Y. TIMES, June 7, 1987. In fact, there is some debate as\nto the authenticity of the Truman quote. See RALPH KEYES, THE QUOTE VERIFIER 47 (New York:\nSt. Martin’s Griffin, New York, 2006). However, the sentiment’s durability is unquestionable.\nSee, e.g., CATHERINE SINCLAIR, MODERN FLIRTATIONS: OR, A MONTH AT HARROWGATE (1841)\n(“As Lord Byron said, ‘nobody need want a friend who can get a dog.’”); LORD BYRON, EPITAPH\nTO A DOG (1808) (“But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend / The first to welcome, foremost to\ndefend[.]”).\n3\n All references to section notes, chapter notes, headings or subheadings contained herein are to\n2012 HTSUS.\n\f    Court No. 13-00393                                                                        Page 3\n\n\nFacts ¶¶ 12–13, Sept. 18, 2015, ECF No. 21 (“Pl.’s Fact Statement”); Answer to Pl.’s Amended\n\nCompl. ¶ 10, Apr. 27, 2015, ECF. No. 13 (“Def.’s Answer”). Before the court is Quaker Pet’s\n\nMotion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Count I of its Amended Complaint, and its\n\nmemorandum in support of the motion (“Pl.’s Br.”). The court concludes that the pet carriers are\n\nnot, as a matter of law, classifiable under heading 4202. However, the relevant record is not\n\nsufficiently developed yet for the court to determine whether the products are classifiable under\n\nheading 6307. Thus, Quaker Pet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted in part and\n\ndenied in part, and the parties are directed to file a proposed schedule for future proceedings.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n                                 I.

Although the court is\n\nunpersuaded that Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1 necessarily excludes Quaker Pet’s products\n\nfrom Chapter 42, the court concludes as a matter of law that the products are not properly\n\nclassifiable under heading 4202 according to Federal Circuit precedent. However, the relevant\n\n\n\n\n9\n This case need not proceed beyond GRI 1, as discussed below, and so further discussion of GRI\n2 and GRI 3 is unnecessary.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                        Page 10\n\n\nrecord is not sufficiently developed yet for the court to determine whether the products are\n\nclassifiable under heading 6307.\n\n   I.    Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1 Does Not Automatically Exclude Quaker Pet’s\n                                   Products from Chapter 42.\n        Applying GRI 1, the court first considers the language of the relevant headings and any\n\napplicable chapter or section notes. See Faus Grp., 581 at 1372 (citing Orlando Food Corp., 140\n\nF.3d at 1440). By its terms, heading 4202 covers:\n\n               Trunks, suitcases, vanity cases, attaché cases, briefcases, school\n               satchels, spectacle cases, binocular cases, camera cases, musical\n               instrument cases, gun cases, holsters and similar containers;\n               traveling bags, insulated food or beverage bags, toiletry bags,\n               knapsacks and backpacks, handbags, shopping bags, wallets, purses,\n               map cases, cigarette cases, tobacco pouches, tool bags, sports bags,\n               bottle cases, jewelry boxes, powder cases, cutlery cases and similar\n               containers, of leather or of composition leather, of sheeting of\n               plastics, of textile materials, of vulcanized fiber or of paperboard, or\n               wholly or mainly covered with such materials or with paper:…\n\n\nHTSUS 4202. HTSUS Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, further provides that “the expression\n\n‘travel, sports and similar bags’ means goods, other than those falling in subheadings 4202.11\n\nthrough 4202.39, of a kind designed for carrying clothing and other personal effects during travel,\n\nincluding backpacks and shopping bags of this heading, but does not include binocular cases,\n\ncamera cases, musical instrument cases, bottle cases and similar containers.” HTSUS Chapter 42,\n\nAdditional U.S. Note 1. Pets are not clothing, and thus whether pet carriers fall within “travel,\n\nsport and similar bags” depends on whether pets are “personal effects.”\n\n        HTSUS does not define “personal effects.” To ascertain the meaning of “personal effects,”\n\nthe court may “consult lexicographic and scientific authorities, dictionaries, and other reliable\n\ninformation” or may rely on its “own understanding of the terms used.” Baxter Healthcare Corp.,\n\n182 F.3d at 1337–38; see Millennium Lumber, 558 F.3d at 1328–29 (citation omitted); Carl Zeiss,\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                          Page 11\n\n\n195 F.3d at 1379 (citation omitted). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,\n\n(3rd Ed., 1992 at page 1351) defines personal effects as “[p]rivately owned items, such as keys,\n\nan identification card, or a wallet or watch, that are regularly worn or carried on one’s person.”\n\nOther dictionaries provide nearly identical definitions. See Random House Dictionary of the\n\nEnglish Language, (2nd Ed. unabridged at page 1445) (“privately owned articles consisting chiefly\n\nof clothing, toilet items, etc., for intimate use by an individual”); Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate\n\nDictionary, (1986 at page 877) (“privately owned items (as clothing and toilet articles) normally\n\nworn or carried on the person”). Dogs and cats are not normally worn or carried on the person,\n\nnor are they similar inanimate objects “such as keys, an identification card, or a wallet or watch.”\n\n       The Government argues that Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1, is irrelevant to the court’s\n\nclassification decision, because “[w]hether or not a product may fit within particular subheadings\n\nor heading 4202 is not dispositive of whether it could fall anywhere within the heading” and that\n\n“[o]nly after determining that a product is classifiable under the heading should the court look to\n\nthe subheadings to find the correct classification for the merchandise.” Def.’s Br. at 15 (citing\n\nOrlando Food Corp., 140 F.3d at 1440).\n\n       The court is required to “first construe[] the nature of the heading, and any section or\n\nchapter notes in question, to determine whether the product at issue is classifiable under the\n\nheading.” Orlando Food Corp., 140 F.3d at 1440. Although Chapter 42, Additional U.S. Note 1\n\nmentions some specific subheadings, that fact does not preclude the court from considering the\n\ndefinition this chapter note provides at the GRI 1 stage. 10\n\n\n\n\n10\n Further, the Government presents no authority that supports ignoring a chapter note because it\nmentions specific subheadings. Indeed, the subheadings mentioned in Chapter 42, Additional U.S.\nNote 1, simply do not contain the term “travel, sports and similar bags” defined by that Note. See\nHTSUS 4202.11–.39.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 12\n\n\n       The Government also argues that pets are personal property or “effects” of their owners\n\nand thus are “personal effects” for the purposes of HTSUS classification, and cites several cases\n\nin support of this contention.

The Government further cites Social Security\n\nAdministration (“SSA”) documents explicitly including pets in the definition of personal effects\n\nfor the purposes of determining Supplemental Security Income benefits. Def.’s Br. at 15 (citing\n\nSSA:     Program      Operations      Manual      System,     SI    01130.430,      available     at\n\nhttps://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0501130430).\n\n       The court finds this argument unpersuasive. First, the court notes that none of these sources\n\nassess the definition of personal effects under the HTSUS or relate to the HTSUS at all. Further,\n\nthe cases do not address whether dogs are personal effects, but instead whether they are personal\n\nproperty or effects. “Personal property” and “effects” 11 cover a much broader range of property\n\nthan “personal effects,” which is limited to property normally worn or carried on the person, as\n\ndiscussed above. Thus, the cases do not provide any guidance on the common or commercial\n\nmeaning of the term “personal effects” in the context of HTSUS heading 4202. Additionally,\n\nalthough the SSA documents do define “personal effects,” the definitions cited therein are\n\n\n\n\n11\n  The definitions of “personal property” and “effects” are property “consisting in general of things\ntemporary or movable including intangible property” and “movable property,” respectively.\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary at 724, 1687.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                             Page 13\n\n\nregulatory definitions in the context of personal property, and are not relevant to the common or\n\ncommercial meaning of the term “personal effects” for purposes of HTSUS heading 4202.\n\n           Even though a pet is not a personal effect -- and therefore, the pet carriers are not similar\n\nto a travel or sport bag -- that does not automatically exclude the pet carriers from heading 4202,\n\nas the pet carriers could be similar to another type of bag explicitly listed, such as a suitcase.\n\n     II.

Cir. 2005)\n\n(emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n           As a threshold question, the court considers whether pets are items. An “item” is defined\n\nas “an individual thing (as an article of household goods, an article of apparel, an object in an art\n\ncollection, a book in a library) singled out from an aggregate of individual things (as those being\n\nenumerated in a bill or inventory or similar list).” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary\n\nat 1203. A “thing” is defined as “an inanimate object as distinguished from a living being.” Id. at\n\n\n\n\n12\n   Although not binding law, courts also look to the Explanatory Notes (“ENs”) to the Harmonized\nCommodity Description and Coding System, maintained by the World Customs Organization, as\npersuasive authority on how to interpret and apply HTSUS provisions. See Home Depot, 491 F.3d\nat 1336 (“Although the Explanatory Notes ‘do not constitute controlling legislative history,’ they\nare nonetheless intended to offer guidance in clarifying the scope of HTSUS subheadings.” (citing\nMita Copystar Am. v.

The ENs to HTSUS Chapter 42, however, do not provide guidance relevant\nto the issue at hand, and so do not factor into the court’s analysis here.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                          Page 14\n\n\n2376. Pets are living beings, and thus not things or items. Therefore, the pet carriers in question\n\ndo not fulfill the criteria propounded in the Avenues In Leather case for classification under\n\nheading 4202.\n\n       At oral argument, the Government contended that the common characteristic or unifying\n\npurpose of the goods in heading 4202 was only to organize, store, protect, and carry; that “items”\n\nwas merely a placeholder word for whatever heading 4202 containers organized, stored, protected,\n\nand carried; and that to consider “items” part of the common characteristic of the goods in heading\n\n4202 would impose a distinction between animate and inanimate objects that the Federal Circuit\n\ndid not intend and that had no basis in the tariff heading. Oral Argument. The court finds this\n\nreasoning unpersuasive. The Government offers no compelling reason to conclude that the Federal\n\nCircuit’s choice of the word “items” was any less deliberate than its choice of “organizing, storing,\n\nprotecting, and carrying” when articulating the common characteristic or unifying purpose of the\n\ngoods in heading 4202. Further, the distinction between animate and inanimate objects is\n\nsupported by the tariff heading itself: all exemplar goods listed in heading 4202 are designed to\n\ncontain inanimate objects and not living beings. HTSUS 4202; see also Firstrax, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">5024271</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9 (“On their face, exemplars listed in heading 4202 store and/or contain inanimate\n\nobjects of personal property, not living, breathing animals.”).\n\n       The Government also contends that, although the pet carriers do indeed carry pets, other\n\nobjects could be placed in the side pockets of Quaker Pet’s products, and thus it is still proper to\n\nclassify the pet carriers under heading 4202. Def.’s Br. at 9–11. However,\n\n                It is well settled that when a list of items is followed by a general\n                word or phrase, the rule of ejusdem generis 13 is used to determine\n\n\n13\n   Ejusdem generis is a “canon of construction holding that when a general word or phrase follows\na list of specifics, the general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only items of the same\nclass as those listed.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014).\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                         Page 15\n\n\n               the scope of the general word or phrase. In classification cases,\n               ejusdem generis requires that, for any imported merchandise to fall\n               within the scope of the general term or phrase, the merchandise must\n               possess the same essential characteristics or purposes that unite the\n               listed exemplars preceding the general term or phrase. However, a\n               classification under the ejusdem generis principle is inappropriate\n               when an imported article has a specific and primary purpose that is\n               inconsistent with that of the listed exemplars in a particular heading.\n\nAvenues In Leather, 423 F.3d at 1332 (internal citations omitted). Here, the pet carriers’ primary\n\npurpose is to carry living beings -- pets. Amended Compl. ¶ 8; Def.’s Answer ¶ 8. As discussed\n\nabove, this primary purpose is inconsistent with the purpose of the exemplars in heading 4202,\n\nwhich is to organize, store, protect, and carry various inanimate objects. Avenues In Leather, 423\n\nF.3d at 1332; see also HTSUS 4202 (listing containers only designed for use holding inanimate\n\nobjects). Thus, the possibility of placing some objects in the side pockets does not entail that the\n\npet carriers are properly classifiable under heading 4202.\n\n    III.   The Record Is Not Yet Sufficiently Developed for the Court to Determine the\n                               Proper Heading for the Products.\n\n       Continuing the GRI 1 analysis, the court turns to whether the pet carriers are classifiable\n\nunder heading 6307, which covers “Other made up articles, including dress patterns” of textile.\n\nHTSUS 6307. Specifically, heading 6307 includes “made up textile articles of any textile fabric\n\n(woven or knitted fabric, felt, nonwovens, etc.) which are not more specifically described in other\n\nChapters of Section XI or elsewhere in the Nomenclature.” Chapter 63, Explanatory Notes\n\n(emphasis in original). “Made up” is defined by the HTSUS as “[a]ssembled by sewing, gumming\n\nor otherwise (other than piece goods consisting of two or more lengths of identical material joined\n\nend to end and piece goods composed of two or more textiles assembled in layers, whether or not\n\npadded).” HTSUS Section XI, Note 7(e). Under the HTSUS, textiles include fabrics made from\n\nman-made fibers and filaments, including polyethylene. See HTSUS Chapter 54.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                              Page 16\n\n\n        The Government contends that Quaker Pet has not established that the pet carriers can be\n\nclassified under heading 6307 because “there is no evidence in the record as to the ‘predominant\n\nmaterial’ for the five styles of pet carriers at issue, nor any legal analysis as to the relevance of the\n\n‘predominant material.’” Def.’s Br. at 16. The court notes that Quaker Pet is not required to\n\nestablish the correct classification heading: the plaintiff only has the burden of showing the\n\ngovernment’s determined classification to be incorrect. Park B. Smith, 347 F.3d at 925; Jarvis,\n\n733 F.2d at 876. If the plaintiff meets that burden, the Court has an independent duty to arrive at\n\n“the correct result, by whatever procedure is best suited to the case at hand.” Value Vinyls, 568\n\nF.3d at 1377 (citing Jarvis, 733 F.2d at 878) (emphasis in original). However, the undisputed facts\n\ncontained in the pleadings do not provide sufficient information -- for example, the materials\n\ncomprising each style of pet carrier or any procedure through which the products were assembled\n\nor otherwise made up -- for the court to determine whether the pet carriers are properly classifiable\n\nunder HTSUS heading 6307 or another heading. 14\n\n\n\n\n14\n   Quaker Pet contends that the materials it provided as part of mandatory disclosures -- which\ninclude third party marketing materials for each of the pet carrier styles and a sample of one of the\nstyles of pet carrier -- establish that the pet carriers belong in heading 6307. Pl.’s Br. at Exhibit A,\nExhibit B. However, as previously noted supra n.4, the court does not consider the mandatory\ndisclosures as part of ruling on a motion for judgment on the pleadings. Quaker Pet further\nsuggests that, under USCIT Rule 12, the court could convert this motion into a motion for summary\njudgment. USCIT Rule 12 (“If, on a motion [for judgment on the pleadings] under Rule . . . 12(c),\nmatters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be\ntreated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.”). The court declines to use its discretion to\nconvert this motion on the pleadings into a motion for summary judgment, as the Government has\nnot been given sufficient opportunity to present material pertinent to a summary judgment motion.\nSee USCIT Rule 12(d) (“All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the\nmaterial that is pertinent to the motion.”). All briefing and oral argument up to this stage have\naddressed only Quaker Pet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, and thus the Government has\nnot had an adequate opportunity to develop the record and present arguments related to a motion\nfor summary judgment.\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                            Page 17\n\n\n             IV.     The Court Grants the Pending Motion to Withdraw Count II\n\n        In addition to the motion for the judgment on the pleadings, Quaker Pet also filed a Motion\n\nto Withdraw Count II of the Amended Complaint. ECF No. 57. In Count II, see supra n.6, Quaker\n\nPet claimed, in the alternative, that if the court did not find that the pet carriers were classifiable\n\nunder HTSUS heading 6307, they would be classifiable under heading 4201.00.30 (“Harness and\n\nsaddlery for any animal (including traces, leads, knee pads, muzzles, saddle cloths, saddle bags,\n\ndog coats, and the like) of any material: Dog leases, collars, muzzles, harnesses and similar dog\n\nequipment.”). Amended Compl. ¶¶ 12–13. The Government does not consent to this motion\n\n“because this case is designated as a test case, and we believe that all classification claims should\n\nbe address in this action in order to promote efficient adjudication of the suspended cases.” Resp.\n\nto Motion to Withdraw Count II of the Amended Compl., 1–2, ECF No. 59. However, the court\n\nhas an independent duty to evaluate all potential HTSUS classifications, and so withdrawing Count\n\nII will not prevent the court from considering heading 4201 and any other potentially relevant\n\nheadings when ruling on Count I. Value Vinyls, 568 F.3d at 1377 (citing Jarvis, 733 F.2d at 878).\n\nThe court thus grants Quaker Pet’s Motion to Withdraw Count II.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n        Given that the pet carriers’ primary purpose is to carry pets and not items, they are excluded\n\nas a matter of law from heading 4202. However, the undisputed facts contained in the pleadings\n\ndo not provide enough information for the court to determine the proper classification for the\n\nproducts.\n\n        Accordingly, it is hereby\n\n        ORDERED that Quaker Pet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings be granted in part and\n\ndenied in part; and it is further\n\fCourt No. 13-00393                                                                    Page 18\n\n\n        ORDERED that within two weeks of the date of this Opinion, the parties shall file a\n\nproposed schedule for further proceedings consistent with this opinion;\n\n        ORDERED that Quaker Pet’s motion to withdraw count II of the amended complaint be\n\ngranted; and it is further\n\n        ORDERED that count II of the amended complaint shall be withdrawn.\n\n                                                            /s/ Gary S. Katzmann\n                                                            Gary S. Katzmann, Judge\n\n Dated: February 12, 2018\n        New York, New York\n\f</pre>",
