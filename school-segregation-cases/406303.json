The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico held\n\ngeneral elections on November 2, 2004 for a variety of offices,\n\nincluding Governor and Resident Commissioner.    Although over two\n\nmillion votes were cast, preliminary results indicate that the\n\ncandidates from the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") and the New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\"), Aníbal Acevedo Vilá (\"Acevedo\") and\n\nPedro Rosselló González (\"Rosselló\"), respectively, are separated\n\nby a very narrow margin -- a few thousand votes.    This extremely\n\nclose election has raised emotions in Puerto Rico and spawned the\n\nactions that are before us.\n\n          Plaintiffs-Appellees include NPP candidate Rosselló and\n\na number of voters who voted for him in the November 2, 2004\n\nelection (collectively, \"the Rosselló Plaintiffs\").1   Defendants-\n\nAppellants include PDP candidate Acevedo, the Puerto Rico Electoral\n\nCommission (\"the Commission\"), the president of the Commission,\n\nAurelio Gracia Morales (\"Gracia\"), and its three Commissioners\n\n(collectively, \"the Acevedo Defendants\").2   On November 10, 2004,\n\nthe Rosselló Plaintiffs filed suit (\"the Rosselló action\") in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (\"the\n\n\n\n1\n   Luis Fortuño, the NPP candidate for Resident Commissioner, is\nalso a Plaintiff-Appellee.\n2\n   Sila M. Calderón-Serra, the incumbent Governor, and Acevedo's\nIncoming Government Transition Committee are likewise Defendants-\nAppellants.\n\n                                -3-\n\fDistrict Court\") in which they challenged, among other things, the\n\nvalidity of certain ballots that were cast in connection with the\n\nNovember 2, 2004 election.      On November 24, 2004, the District\n\nCourt issued an order that the Commission identify and set aside,\n\nbut not consider, the contested ballots.           The Acevedo Defendants\n\nseek review of that order.\n\n          Also   part   of   this    appeal   is    an   action   filed   on\n\nNovember 16, 2004 in the Court of First Instance for San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico, the local trial court, by four voters (collectively,\n\n\"the Suárez Plaintiffs\") who claim to have cast, and want to\n\nestablish the validity of, the ballots at issue in the Rosselló\n\naction (\"the Suárez action\").3      After the Court of First Instance\n\ndismissed the Suárez action on November 18, 2004 as moot, the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico (\"Supreme Court\") assumed jurisdiction\n\nover the case.   Yet, before the Supreme Court took any meaningful\n\naction, the case was removed to the District Court.           Motions were\n\npromptly filed to remand the action to the Supreme Court, and we\n\nhave since been asked to exercise our power of mandamus and\n\ninstruct the District Court to remand the action.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The following are the defendants in the Suárez action: (1) the\nCommission, (2) the President of the Commission, (3) the three\nCommissioners, (4) Rosselló, and (5) the NPP.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The November 2, 2004 Election\n\n            On November 2, 2004, general elections were held for the\n\noffices of Governor and Resident Commissioner.4           The ballot that\n\nwas to be cast in connection with those two offices (\"the ballot\")\n\nlisted only the candidates for those two offices under the insignia\n\nof their respective political parties.5        Puerto Rico's three major\n\nparties had candidates on the ballot for Governor:            (1) Rosselló,\n\nfrom the NPP; (2) Acevedo, from the PDP; and (3) Rubén Berríos\n\nMartínez, from the Independence Party (\"PIP\").            The parties also\n\nhad candidates on the ballot for Resident Commissioner.\n\n            The   ballot   instructed    voters   to   vote   for    only   one\n\ncandidate for Governor and one for Resident Commissioner.                    On\n\nelection day, voters filled in the ballots in the following ways:\n\n(1) by placing a mark under a party insignia, thereby voting for\n\nall of the candidates in that party's column (\"a straight vote\");\n\n(2) by placing a mark next to the name of each desired candidate\n\nbut not under a party insignia; (3) by placing a mark under a party\n\ninsignia and next to a desired candidate of a party other than the\n\none that had its insignia previously marked;6 or (4) by placing a\n\n\n4\n     The Resident Commissioner           is   Puerto    Rico's      non-voting\nrepresentative in Congress.\n5\n     The ballot is reproduced in Appendix A of this Opinion.\n6\n  The Commission has determined that such a ballot reflects a vote\nfor the desired candidate and the remaining candidate under the\n\n                                   -5-\n\fmark    under    a    party     insignia     and      marks    next   to   two   desired\n\ncandidates associated with a party or parties other than the one\n\nthat had its insignia previously marked (\"a three-mark split\n\nvote\").7\n\n            Prior to the November 2, 2004 election, the Commission,\n\nacting pursuant to its statutory authority, enacted regulations\n\nwhich    outlined         the   procedures    that      were    to    be   followed   in\n\nadjudicating ballots, that is, in determining the validity of\n\nballots    and       in   awarding   votes       to    the    deserving    candidates.8\n\nAccording to the procedures in place during the election in issue,\n\neach ballot was to be initially adjudicated, and each vote was to\n\nbe tallied, at the polling location at which it was cast.9                            If\n\n\n\nparty insignia.\n7\n   As determined by the Commission, see infra, a three-mark split\nvote ballot reflects a vote for the two marked candidates, as well\nas a vote for the party. A vote for a party on a three-mark ballot\nis credited to the party itself (and not to any of its candidates)\nfor purposes of its reclassification as a \"principal party,\" which\nentitles it to certain benefits, including the right to receive\nfunding.   See 16 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 3003, 3116.      A party is a\nprincipal party if, for example, it \"obtained a number of votes\nunder . . . its insignia on the ballot of Governor and Resident\nCommissioner[] of not less [than] seven (7) percent of the total\nnumber of votes cast for all the parties' insignias in the\npreceding general election.\"    § 3003(42) (second alteration in\noriginal).\n8\n    See 16 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 3007(k), 3013(l).\n9\n    Each ballot was to be adjudicated by a group of three\ninspectors, consisting of one representative from each of the three\nprincipal parties. If the inspectors were unable to agree, there\nwere additional levels of review at each polling location. The\nadjudicatory bodies at each level were comprised of one\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthose reviewing a ballot at a polling location were unable to\n\nunanimously agree on the adjudication of the ballot, it was to\n\nremain unadjudicated and be sent to the Commission, along with the\n\nresults of the adjudicated ballots, for review. The Commission was\n\nthen to engage in a \"general canvass,\" during which the results of\n\nthe adjudicated ballots were to be checked and the contested\n\nballots were to be counted or rejected according to the judgment of\n\nthe three Commissioners -- each of whom represented one of the\n\nthree principal parties.10   If they could not reach a unanimous\n\nconsensus, the ballot was to be forwarded to the president of the\n\nCommission for a final determination.11\n\n          Over two million votes were cast in the November 2, 2004\n\ngubernatorial election. Within seventy-two hours of the closing of\n\nthe polls, the Commission issued a preliminary report that Acevedo\n\nwas leading Rosselló by 3,880 votes.   As a result of the closeness\n\nof the election, and in accordance with its regulations, the\n\nCommission, on November 4, 2004, ordered that a recount occur\n\nsimultaneously with the general canvass.    But, the next day, the\n\n\n\n\nrepresentative from each of the three principal parties.\n10\n   Although this is a somewhat simplified account of the general\ncanvass procedures, the omitted details are irrelevant to this\nappeal.\n11\n   \"Any party affected by a resolution, ruling or order of the []\nCommission may, within the ten (10) days following the notice\nthereof, appeal to the Court of First Instance . . . .\" 16 P.R.\nLaws Ann. § 3016a.\n\n                               -7-\n\fpresident of the Commission, Gracia, announced that the recount\n\nwould not begin until the completion of the general canvass.\n\n           During the election, thousands of three-mark split vote\n\nballots -– as many as 28,000 -– were cast.             Apparently, the vast\n\nmajority of these ballots contained a mark under the insignia of\n\nthe PIP and marks next to the two PDP candidates.12\n\n           A number of the three-mark ballots were adjudicated at\n\nthe polling centers on election night.13          And, for the first two or\n\nthree days of the general canvass, which began on November 8, 2004,\n\nsome of the three-mark ballots that had been contested at the\n\npolling    centers,   and   thus,   had     not    been    adjudicated,     were\n\ndetermined to be valid.     But, on November 11, 2004, a dispute arose\n\nwhen the NPP Commissioner took the position that the ballots in\n\nquestion   were   void.     Because   the    PDP     and    PIP   Commissioners\n\ndisagreed, the issue was referred to Gracia. On November 12, 2004,\n\nGracia decided that the ballots contained valid votes for both the\n\nmarked candidates     and   the   marked    party,    and    later   that   day,\n\n\n\n12\n   It has been alleged that, on some of the three-mark split vote\nballots: (1) the mark under the PIP insignia was made in pencil\nwhile the marks next to the PDP candidates were made in pen; and\n(2) the marks next to the PDP candidates were noticeably dissimilar\nfrom the mark made under the PIP insignia.\n13\n   There is, however, a dispute as to whether these ballots were\nadjudicated in a consistent fashion. It has been alleged that some\nof the ballots were declared void, some were adjudicated as\ncontaining valid straight votes for the PIP candidates, and some\nwere adjudicated as containing valid split votes for the PDP\ncandidates, as well as the PIP.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fGracia's decision was memorialized in a written resolution of the\n\nCommission.\n\n             1.   The Federal and State Court Actions\n\n             On November 10, 2004, the Rosselló Plaintiffs filed a\n\ncomplaint against the Acevedo Defendants in the District Court that\n\nasserted various federal constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§    1983   arising   out   of   the   November    2,   2004   election.   On\n\nNovember 12, 2004, an amended complaint was filed alleging that the\n\nCommission's decision to (1) regard the three-mark ballots as valid\n\nand count the votes contained therein, (2) suspend the recount\n\npending completion of the general canvass,14 and (3) disregard\n\ncertain late-filed absentee ballots15 violated a variety of their\n\nfederal constitutional rights.16             The Rosselló Plaintiffs sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the above\n\n\n\n\n14\n   The Rosselló Plaintiffs, by their own concession, \"have achieved\ncomplete and substantial relief\" on this claim, and therefore, we\nneed not give it any further consideration.\n15\n    The Rosselló Plaintiffs have conceded, both in their opening\nbrief and at oral argument, that they \"have achieved complete and\nsubstantial relief\" from the Commission with respect to this claim.\nTo be sure, there is still a question as to whether the Commission\nwill follow through with the relief it has promised.       But, any\nclaim concerning this open question is not yet ripe.\n16\n    In addition, the Rosselló Plaintiffs have alleged that the\nCommission violated their constitutional rights when it made\n\"substantial changes\" to the rules governing the election after the\nvotes had been cast.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fchallenges.17    The   District    Court   scheduled   a   hearing   for\n\nNovember 18, 2004.18\n\n          Meanwhile, on November 16, 2004, the Suárez Plaintiffs,\n\nwho claim to have cast three-mark ballots, filed suit in the Court\n\nof First Instance seeking, among other things, a declaratory\n\njudgment as to the validity of the three-mark ballots and an\n\ninjunction requiring the Commission to adjudicate the ballots.19\n\nThe Suárez Plaintiffs insisted that an invalidation of the ballots\n\nwould deprive them of their right to vote and, thus, their \"right\n\nto due process of law and to equal protection under the law.\"20\n\n\n\n\n17\n   The Rosselló Plaintiffs also sought injunctive and declaratory\nrelief in connection with their claim that Puerto Rico Law No. 197,\n1 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 456 et seq., \"is unconstitutional to the extent\nthat it purports to authorize or allow the transition process [for\nthe next governor] to proceed before the next governor . . . has\nbeen determined.\" We need not address this issue. The District\nCourt denied preliminary injunctive relief on this claim, and the\nRosselló Plaintiffs did not bother to appeal that ruling.\nMoreover, whether Law No. 197 allows the transition process to go\nforward during a recount is a question of local law that will soon\nbe mooted by the recount.\n18\n    We note that the Rosselló Plaintiffs chose to challenge the\ndecisions of the Commission in federal court rather than exercise\ntheir statutory right to appeal to the Court of First Instance.\nSee 16 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3016a.\n19\n    The Suárez Plaintiffs also sought declaratory and injunctive\nrelief requiring the Commission to (1) complete the general canvass\nbefore conducting a recount and (2) certify the winning\ngubernatorial candidate by December 22, 2004.\n20\n     The Suárez Plaintiffs filed this action even though the\nCommission had already decided that the three-mark ballots are\nvalid.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            The Court of First Instance dismissed the Suárez action\n\nwithout prejudice on November 18, 2004 on the ground that no actual\n\ncontroversy existed because the Commission had already upheld the\n\nvalidity of the ballots.21      That same day, the Suárez Plaintiffs,\n\nconcerned that the validity of the ballots had not been adequately\n\nestablished, requested that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico review\n\nthe Court of First Instance's dismissal.         The Supreme Court agreed\n\nto do so.    On the morning of November 20, 2004, the Commissioner of\n\nthe NPP and the NPP itself, defendants in the Suárez action,\n\nremoved the action to the District Court.             Notice of removal was\n\nfiled with the Supreme Court at 11:48 a.m.        In response, the Suárez\n\nPlaintiffs and a defendant in the Suárez action, alleging various\n\nprocedural    defects   in   removal,22   as   well   as   lack   of   federal\n\njurisdiction, moved the District Court to remand. Soon thereafter,\n\ntwo mandamus petitions were filed in this court, each one seeking\n\nan order requiring that the District Court remand the action.\n\n             Despite the removal, the Supreme Court purported to enter\n\na judgment on the Suárez action on the evening of November 20,\n\n2004.   By a vote of four to three, it ordered that the three-mark\n\nballots were to be adjudicated as containing valid votes for the\n\n\n21\n   Significantly, the Commissioner of the NPP, a defendant in the\nSuárez action, had requested dismissal on several grounds, one of\nwhich was lack of jurisdiction because the Commission had already\nadjudicated the contested ballots as valid.\n22\n    Because of the disposition of the removal issue on other\ngrounds, we need not address the alleged procedural defects.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmarked candidates for Governor and Resident Commissioner, as well\n\nas the identified party for purposes of maintaining its principal\n\nparty status.    See supra note 7.\n\n            On November 20, 2004, the District Court issued an order\n\nin   the   Rosselló    action     that   the   Commission    \"set   aside    and\n\nsegregate\" the three-mark ballots and refrain from announcing the\n\nwinner of the gubernatorial election.           Then, on November 24, 2004,\n\nthe District Court issued an order that:               (1) stated that the\n\nSupreme Court's judgment was void because the removal rendered the\n\nSupreme Court without jurisdiction to enter the judgment;23 and (2)\n\nordered that a recount be conducted by \"counting the number of\n\n[three-mark] split ballots, identifying and segregating the same,\n\nbut not adjudicating the ballots.\"             (Emphasis in original.)       The\n\nAcevedo Defendants appealed from the order that the three-vote\n\nballots not be adjudicated.\n\n                      II.   THE PETITIONS FOR MANDAMUS\n\n            We begin with the two Emergency Petitions for Writ of\n\nMandamus that    request     we    exercise    our   power   of   mandamus   and\n\ninstruct the District Court to remand the Suárez action to the\n\n\n23\n    We agree with the District Court that the Supreme Court's\njudgment was void. The governing statute provides that the filing\nof \"a copy of the notice [of removal] with the clerk of [the] State\ncourt . . . effect[s] the removal and the State court shall proceed\nno further unless and until the case is remanded.\" 28 U.S.C. §\n1446(d) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court received notice of the\nremoval at 11:48 a.m. on November 20, 2004 but did not issue\njudgment until that evening. The judgment is thus, as the District\nCourt found, a nullity.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fPuerto Rico courts.        These mandamus petitions contest the validity\n\nof removal on two principal grounds: (1) the absence of federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction over the Suárez action, and (2) the failure\n\nof the removing parties to obtain the consent of all Suárez action\n\ndefendants    (including         Petitioners)    to    removal.        Since   both\n\npetitions are substantially the same, they will be discussed as\n\none.\n\n             We note at the outset that we have given the District\n\nCourt ample opportunity to decide whether removal of the Suárez\n\naction was proper, and despite the time-sensitive nature of this\n\ncase, and three weeks of hearings on the merits of the Rosselló\n\naction which has been consolidated with this case for appeal, we\n\nare now faced with the extreme decision of whether we should compel\n\nremand through a Writ of Mandamus.\n\n             In order to stave off the need for mandamus, we invited\n\nthe District       Court    to   address   these      mandamus   petitions.      In\n\nresponse,    the    court    appended      a   footnote    to    the   opinion   of\n\nNovember 30, 2004 in which the District Court asserted jurisdiction\n\nover the parallel federal case.            Pedro Rosselló, et al. v. Sila M.\n\nCalderón, et al., No. 04-2251, slip op. at 3, n.2 (D.P.R. Nov. 30,\n\n2004).      The footnote indicated that a hearing was needed to\n\nproperly evaluate the jurisdictional issues raised in the pending\n\nmotions to remand.          Specifically, the District Court indicated:\n\n(1) that the Suárez Plaintiffs' complaint had alleged violations of\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fdue process and equal protection without specifying whether the\n\nsource   of    these    protections    was     the   Commonwealth   or   Federal\n\nConstitution; (2) that federal jurisdiction might be required under\n\nFranchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, 463\n\nU.S. 1, 22 (1983); and finally, (3) that the legal interests of\n\nsome Suárez Defendants might require their realignment with the\n\nplaintiffs in that action.\n\n              Following a hearing on December 8, 2004, the District\n\nCourt issued an opinion resolving various challenges to the removal\n\njurisdiction. Manuel R. Suárez, et al. v. Comisión Estatal de\n\nElecciones,     et     al.,   No.   04-2288,    slip   op.   (D.P.R.   Dec.   10,\n\n2004)(hereinafter \"Remand Opinion\"). In that opinion, the District\n\nCourt held that \"examining the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the defendants . . . an overvote issue may exist[] in violation\n\nof Due Process and Equal Protection principles under the case of\n\nBonas v. Town of North Smithfield, 265 F.3d 69 (1st Cir. 2001).\"\n\nRemand Opinion at 12-13; see also Bonas, 265 F.3d at 73-74.24\n\nAlthough it evaluated and rejected the majority of the arguments\n\nagainst removal before it, the District Court still has not made a\n\nfinal decision on the ultimate question of whether to remand the\n\ncase to the Puerto Rico courts.          Nevertheless, the District Court\n\ndetermined in its December 10 opinion that a federal question had\n\n\n\n24\n   We address the applicability of Bonas below in our discussion\nof the Rosselló action.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fbeen presented in the Suárez complaint.     That determination was\n\nplainly erroneous, and our resolution of the Rosselló action today\n\nis decisive of the motion to remand.     Because the District Court\n\nplainly erred, and because every additional day spent adjudicating\n\nthis issue before the District Court or on appeal before this court\n\nincreases the risk of irreparable harm, our intervention by Writ of\n\nMandamus would be appropriate.\n\nA.   Availability of Mandamus\n\n          Although it is an extraordinary remedy, mandamus can be\n\nappropriate in those rare cases in which the issuance (or non-\n\nissuance) of an order (1) raises a question about the limits of\n\njudicial power, (2) poses a risk of irreparable harm to the\n\nappellant, and (3) is plainly erroneous.         See Christopher v.\n\nStanley-Bostich, Inc., 240 F.3d 95, 99 (1st Cir. 2001).    Moreover,\n\n\"the case for mandamus is particularly compelling where the order\n\nposes an elemental question of judicial authority.\" Id. at 99-100.\n\nThe instant petitions clearly meet the first requirement, as they\n\nconcern the boundaries of the District Court's power to remove\n\ncases from Commonwealth courts.     See, e.g.,   Hernández-Agosto v.\n\nRomero-Barceló, 748 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1984) (issuing mandamus\n\nto remand improperly removed action to Puerto Rico court). Second,\n\nthe risk of irreparable harm from the continued pendency of removal\n\njurisdiction is acute:    there are now fewer than three weeks\n\nremaining before inauguration day on January 2, 2005.     Third, as\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\felucidated below, we find that the District Court's failure to\n\nremand is plainly erroneous because the Suárez Plaintiffs presented\n\nno claim of right arising under federal law.         See 28 U.S.C. § 1441.\n\nB.    Validity of Removal\n\n            We find that the exercise of removal jurisdiction is\n\nplainly erroneous in this case because no federal question was\n\npresented in the Suárez action either procedurally (because the\n\nfour corners of the complaint do not plead a federal question) or\n\nsubstantively (because we have decided in the Rosselló action that\n\nthe   federal    courts   will   not    intervene   in   a   local   electoral\n\ndispute).   Because we find that remand to the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt is necessary due to the absence of a federal question, we do\n\nnot address the petitioners' second argument, that removal was\n\nimproper because it did not receive the consent of all defendants\n\nto the Suárez action.\n\n            1.   Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule\n\n            A case may be removed to federal court if it presents a\n\n\"claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of\n\nthe United States.\"       28 U.S.C. § 1441(b).       \"The Supreme Court of\n\nthe United States has made clear that, in deciding (for removal\n\npurposes) whether a case presents a federal 'claim or right,' a\n\ncourt is to ask whether the plaintiff's claim to relief rests upon\n\na federal right, and the court is to look only to plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint to find the answer.\" Hernández-Agosto v. Romero-Barceló,\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f748 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1984) (emphasis in original).                The\n\nexistence of a federal defense is not sufficient for removal\n\njurisdiction.   Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 10-11.       Thus, we must\n\nturn to the Suárez complaint to ascertain whether, within its four\n\ncorners, a federal \"claim or right\" has been presented.              Our\n\nevaluation centers on the complaint's allegations of violations of\n\n\"due process\" and \"equal protection.\"25            These   claims do not\n\nexplicitly   state   whether   the   source   of   these   constitutional\n\nprotections is the Commonwealth or the Federal Constitution.26\n\n\n25\n    Respondents also note that the Suárez complaint attached and\nmade reference to the complaint filed four days earlier in federal\ncourt by Rosselló.    No federal claim can be inferred from this\nreference to the federal action; rather, it was included in the\nSuárez complaint as factual background. See Suárez complaint at\npara. 8.    Further, even assuming it is proper for us to look\noutside the four corners of the Suárez complaint to the previously-\nfiled federal action, as we discuss below, the Rosselló complaint\ndoes not state a claim warranting federal intervention into this\nlocal electoral dispute, and therefore cannot be considered\nsufficiently substantial to give rise to removal jurisdiction under\nFranchise Tax Board. See Almond v. Capital Props., Inc., 212 F.3d\n20, 23 (1st Cir. 2003).\n26\n   We are aware of only one other case dealing with federal removal\njurisdiction over a claim filed in state court with ambiguous\nreferences to constitutional provisions.       In Dardeau v. West\nOrange-Grove Consolidated I.S.D., 43 F. Supp. 2d 722 (E.D. Tex.\n1999), a federal district court evaluated a situation very much\nlike the one we face here. In Dardeau, a complaint was filed in\nstate court that made explicit reference only to state law, but\nalso claimed a violation of \"due process.\" Ambiguity with regard\nto the source of this right was heightened relative to our case\nbecause, while those words appear in the United States\nConstitution, the Texas Constitution uses the phrase \"due course of\nlaw.\" Id. at 732. For reasons substantially similar to those we\nset out below, the district court nevertheless interpreted the\ncomplaint narrowly to find no federal cause of action to sustain\nremoval jurisdiction. Id. at 730-34.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          Read as a whole, we cannot say that this complaint\n\npresents a claim under the Federal Constitution.                    No explicit\n\nreference to the United States Constitution or any other federal\n\nlaw is contained in the complaint; instead, all references are to\n\nPuerto   Rico   state       laws,   regulations,       and   the    Commonwealth\n\nConstitution.    Specifically, paragraph 11 of the complaint bases\n\nthe Suárez Plaintiffs' claims in the right to vote guaranteed in\n\nArticle II, Section 2, of the Commonwealth Constitution.                        The\n\ncomplaint's subsequent references to the plaintiffs' rights to vote\n\nand to have their votes counted in accordance with equal protection\n\nand due process, while not expressly premised on the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution, logically refer back to the antecedent citation to\n\nArticle II, Section 2 of the Commonwealth Constitution.\n\n          Moreover, it is well-settled that \"the plaintiff [is] the\n\nmaster of the claim; he or she may avoid federal jurisdiction by\n\nexclusive reliance on state law.\"            Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams,\n\n482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987).         Thus, the burden to prove that a federal\n\nquestion has been pled lies with the party seeking removal.                     BIW\n\nDeceived v.     Local      S6,   Indus.   Union   of   Marine   &   Shipbuilding\n\nWorkers, 132 F.3d 824, 831 (1st Cir. 1997).                  In light of this\n\nburden, and     of   the    important     federalism    concerns    at   play   in\n\nconsidering removal jurisdiction, see, e.g., Franchise Tax Bd., 463\n\nU.S. at 8, we find that any ambiguity as to the source of law\n\nrelied upon by the Suárez plaintiffs ought to be resolved against\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fremoval.    See Shamrock Oil & Gas Corp. v. Sheets, 313 U.S. 100,\n\n108-09 (1941) (removal statute should be strictly construed against\n\nremoval).\n\n            2.    Artful Pleading Doctrine\n\n            The   Respondents   invite   this   court   to   consider   the\n\npossibility that the Suárez Plaintiffs engaged in artful pleading,\n\na \"corollary of the well-pleaded complaint rule that a plaintiff\n\nmay not defeat removal by omitting to plead necessary federal\n\nquestions in a complaint.\"      Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 22.       As\n\ndiscussed below with regard to federal ingredient jurisdiction, no\n\nfederal question is necessary to the resolution of the state claims\n\nraised in the Suárez complaint.      Furthermore, we are skeptical of\n\nthe applicability of the artful pleading doctrine outside of\n\ncomplete federal preemption of a state cause of action. See, e.g.,\n\nid. at 23 (stating that the \"necessary ground\" for the creation of\n\nthe artful pleading doctrine \"was that the preemptive force of [a\n\nfederal statute was] so powerful as to displace entirely any state\n\ncause of action\"); Rivet v. Regions Bank, 522 U.S. 470, 475-76\n\n(1998) (\"The artful pleading doctrine allows removal where federal\n\nlaw completely preempts a plaintiff's state-law claim.\").               And\n\nsurely, the United States Constitution cannot be said to wholly\n\npreempt the Commonwealth's grant of similar rights under its own\n\nConstitution.     See PruneYard Shopping Ctr. v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74,\n\n81 (1980) (state constitution may afford more, but not less,\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fprotection than Federal Constitution); see also Nieves v. Univ. of\n\nPuerto    Rico,    7    F.3d    270,       275   (1st    Cir.    1993)   (noting     that\n\n\"'poverty'    is       considered      a    suspect     classification       under    the\n\nCommonwealth constitution, triggering 'strict scrutiny' analysis\n\nunobtainable under the Equal Protection Clause of the United States\n\nConstitution\").             Thus,   the     artful      pleading    doctrine    has    no\n\napplication to this dispute.\n\n            3.     Federal Ingredient\n\n            Respondents also argue that even in the absence of a\n\nclaim arising under federal law on the face of plaintiffs' well-\n\npleaded complaint, federal removal jurisdiction is still proper\n\nunder the Supreme Court's statement in Franchise Tax Board that\n\nremoval    would       be    appropriate         \"if    a   well-pleaded     complaint\n\nestablished that [the plaintiff's] right to relief under state law\n\nrequires resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\" 463\n\nU.S. at 13.        Under this \"federal ingredient\" doctrine, a case\n\narises    under    federal      law    for       purposes   of     removal   when    \"the\n\nplaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a\n\nsubstantial question of federal law.\"                   Id. at 27-28.\n\n            Federal ingredient jurisdiction remains \"controversial,\"\n\nAlmond, 212 F.3d at 23, because\n\n            [t]he Supreme Court has periodically affirmed\n            this basis for jurisdiction in the abstract\n            . . ., occasionally cast doubt upon it, rarely\n            applied it in practice, and left the very\n            scope of the concept unclear.     Perhaps the\n            best one can say is that this basis endures in\n\n                                            -20-\n\f           principle but should be applied with caution\n           and various qualifications.\n\nId. (internal citations and footnote omitted); see also Metheny v.\n\nBecker, 352 F.3d 458, 460 (1st Cir. 2003) (noting that federal\n\ningredient doctrine \"remains vibrant in this circuit but 'should be\n\napplied with caution'\" (quoting Almond, 212 F.3d at 23)).                   With\n\nthis caution in mind, we turn to the respondents' argument.\n\n           Respondents        hang    their   jurisdictional     hat   on   two\n\ndoctrines that they allege exist in the caselaw of the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court.     The first stems from the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt's    statements    in    a     1964   case   that,   in   accepting    the\n\nCommonwealth's Bill of Rights, the United States Congress \"was to\n\npresume -- and in fact it is so and ought to be -- that the public\n\npowers and the courts of the Commonwealth shall render effective\n\nand construe the provisions of the [Puerto Rico] Bill of Rights in\n\na manner consistent with the protection afforded . . . by the same\n\nor similar provisions of the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nR.C.A. Communications, Inc. v. Gov't of the Capital, 91 P.R.R. 404,\n\n414-15 (P.R. 1964).       The second comes into play when a federal\n\ncourt certifies a question of state law to the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt.    According to the Supreme Court:\n\n            [W]hen the question before us refers to the\n            validity of a state law under a clause of the\n            state constitution that is similar to a clause\n            in the federal Constitution . . . the issue is\n            a mixed question of federal and state rights\n            that must be resolved by the federal court,\n            because the validity of the statute under the\n\n                                       -21-\n\f            federal Constitution necessarily disposes of\n            the question under state law. . . . In these\n            circumstances we must refuse certification,\n            since our decision would be only advisory.\n\nPan Am. Computer Corp. v. Data Gen. Corp., 112 D.P.R. 780, 793-94\n\n(1982)    (translation    supplied    by    this    court).        According    to\n\nRespondents, these two provisions mean that the Supreme Court's\n\nevaluation of the Suárez Plaintiffs' claims under the due process\n\nand equal protection doctrines of the Commonwealth Constitution\n\nwill require the resolution of a federal question:                   whether the\n\nparallel provisions of the United States Constitution would be\n\nviolated by the acts in question.          Accordingly, Respondents argue,\n\nthe District Court has removal jurisdiction under the federal\n\ningredient doctrine.\n\n            These arguments fundamentally misconstrue the federal\n\ningredient doctrine.       Whether a state court will adopt as the\n\nmeaning    of   the    state's      constitution      the       federal     courts'\n\ninterpretation    of     parallel     language      in    the     United     States\n\nConstitution is a matter of state law.             See, e.g., Nieves, 7 F.3d\n\nat 274.    Federal law does not compel such an outcome.                    Thus, a\n\ndetermination    of    whether   a    violation      of     the    Puerto     Rican\n\nConstitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection has\n\noccurred does not \"require resolution\" of whether the conduct\n\ncomplained of would violate the Federal Constitution.                     Franchise\n\nTax Bd., 463 U.S. at 13 (emphasis added); see also Gully v. First\n\nNat'l Bank, 299 U.S. 109, 112-13 (1936) (\"To bring a case within\n\n                                     -22-\n\fthe   [removal]    statute,      a    right    or    immunity    created    by   the\n\nConstitution . . . must be an element, and an essential one, of the\n\nplaintiff's     cause   of    action.\")       (emphasis    added).     To   decide\n\notherwise would mean that any case brought under a provision of the\n\nPuerto Rico Constitution that mirrors the language of the United\n\nStates   Constitution         could    be     removed     into   federal    court.\n\nAccordingly, we find that removal jurisdiction over the Suárez\n\naction is lacking, and it must be remanded to the Commonwealth\n\ncourt from which it was removed.              28 U.S.C. § 1447.\n\n           4.     Effect of the Rosselló Decision\n\n           Lastly,      and    perhaps      most    significantly,   the    Suárez\n\ncomplaint cannot be said to state a federal question, because, as\n\nwe will discuss now, the federal courts will not intervene in a\n\nlocal electoral dispute such as this.               Although we find that it was\n\nplain error for the District Court not to remand the Suárez action\n\nback to the Puerto Rico courts on the basis of the well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint rule, and therefore we could issue a Writ of Mandamus\n\ncompelling remand, we realize that the District Court now has the\n\nbenefit of both our above discussion and our decision in the\n\nRosselló action.        Therefore, we are confident that the District\n\nCourt will immediately remand the Suárez action back to the Supreme\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico without the need for mandamus.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f             III.   APPEAL OF THE NON-ADJUDICATION ORDER\n\n            We now turn to the appeal of the non-adjudication order\n\nthat is before us in connection with the Rosselló action.            We have\n\nrepeatedly held that federal courts \"normally may not . . .\n\nundertake     the   resolution    of         'garden    variety     election\n\nirregularities.'\" Bonas, 265 F.3d at 74 (quoting Griffin v. Burns,\n\n570 F.2d 1065, 1076 (1st Cir. 1978)).          We have departed from this\n\ngeneral rule of non-intervention on only two occasions. See Bonas,\n\n265 F.3d at 75-76; Griffin, 570 F.2d at 1079.              As we elucidate\n\nbelow, those two cases are easily distinguished from the case at\n\nhand.   Here, Circuit precedent demands application of the general\n\nprinciple   of   non-intervention,     and    therefore,   we     vacate   the\n\nissuance of the preliminary injunction and direct the District\n\nCourt to dismiss the case.\n\nA.   Nature of Our Review\n\n            The Acevedo Defendants are presently before us seeking\n\nreview of the District Court's issuance of a preliminary injunction\n\nto segregate, but not adjudicate, all three-mark split vote ballots\n\ncast during the November 2, 2004 election.             It appears from the\n\nlanguage in the order implementing the injunction that the District\n\nCourt issued the injunction merely to preserve its jurisdiction,\n\nand therefore we will treat it as such.27\n\n\n27\n   Although we are skeptical that the only purpose or effect of the\ninjunction was to preserve jurisdiction, especially considering the\nfact that this \"jurisdiction-preserving\" injunction is still in\n\n                                 -24-\n\fB.   Temporary Injunctions to Preserve Jurisdiction\n\n          Congress has provided \"[t]he Supreme Court and all courts\n\nestablished by Act of Congress [with the authority to] issue all\n\nwrits   necessary   or   appropriate     in   aid   of   their   respective\n\njurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).     Acting pursuant to § 1651(a), a federal court\n\nmay issue an injunction as a means to preserve its jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., 376 F.3d 1092, 1099\n\n(11th Cir. 2004).   But, for a court to invoke § 1651(a) and issue\n\nan injunction to protect its jurisdiction over an action, there\n\nmust be at least the possibility that the complaint states a\n\njusticiable federal claim.      Thus, implicit in our review of the\n\nissuance of the injunction is our review of whether the Rosselló\n\ncomplaint, taking all claims alleged therein as proven, had the\n\npotential to present a justiciable federal claim under existing\n\nCircuit precedent. Mercury Motor Express, Inc. v. Brinke, 475 F.2d\n\n\nplace after approximately three weeks worth of \"marathon hearings\"\non the merits, we find that our skepticism is irrelevant in light\nof the manner in which we resolve the case. Furthermore, although\nwe believe that we properly review the non-adjudication order as an\nappealable interlocutory injunction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(a)(1), we note that even if we were incorrect in this\nconclusion, we would, in the alternative, exercise our discretion\nto treat the Acevedo Defendants' notice of appeal as a petition for\nmandamus under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), thus\npreserving our jurisdiction in any event. See, e.g., United States\nv. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 769 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"We are fortified in our\nresolve to hear and determine this appeal by the knowledge that,\neven if no appeal lies as of right, we possess--and can\nappropriately exercise--the power of discretionary review via\nmandamus, to address the important question raised in this case.\").\n\n                                  -25-\n\f1086, 1091 (5th Cir. 1973) (\"Once a case is lawfully before a court\n\nof appeals, it does not lack power to do what plainly ought to be\n\ndone. . . . [It has] the power . . . to reach the merits of a case\n\nbefore it on an interlocutory appeal and [to] dismiss the action.\")\n\n(internal quotation marks, alterations, and citations omitted); see\n\nalso Aerojet-Gen. Corp. v. Am. Arbitration Ass'n, 478 F.2d 248, 252\n\n(9th Cir. 1973) (\"[I]t is well established that in [an equity]\n\ncase, . . . an interlocutory appeal brings the entire case before\n\nthe court.\").\n\n           Our review is for abuse of discretion. Klay, 376 F.3d at\n\n1096.\n\nC.   Federal Jurisdiction Over § 1983 Complaints\n\n           Having   determined   that    we   must   inquire   whether   the\n\nDistrict Court should have intervened in this local election\n\ndispute based on the claims alleged in the complaint, our first\n\nstep necessarily begins at the broadest level –- that is, whether\n\nthe District Court had federal subject matter jurisdiction over the\n\naction.   See Bonas, 265 F.3d at 73.      \"Federal courts are courts of\n\nlimited jurisdiction, and therefore must be certain that they have\n\nexplicit authority to decide a case.\" Id. (citing Irving v. United\n\nStates, 162 F.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc)).            \"Thus, we\n\nsubject the plaintiffs' choice of a federal forum to careful\n\nscrutiny.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\f             In Griffin, we set forth the analytical framework to\n\nevaluate whether a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over\n\na local electoral dispute.          See 570 F.2d at 1070; see also Bonas,\n\n265 F.3d at 73.           As this case is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, we turn to the language of the jurisdictional counterpart\n\nof that statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3), which mirrors § 1983, and\n\nprovides that \"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of\n\nany civil action . . . [t]o redress the deprivation, under color of\n\nState law, statute, . . . custom or usage, of any right, privilege\n\nor immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by\n\nany Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . .\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1343(3).          Thus, federal jurisdiction hinges on whether\n\nplaintiffs have a colorable claim under § 1983.28                See Griffin, 570\n\nF.2d at 1070; see also Bonas, 265 F.3d at 73-74 (\"In other words,\n\nfederal courts have jurisdiction over claims arising out of a state\n\nor   local   electoral       dispute   if,   and    to   the   extent   that,   the\n\ncomplaint limns a set of facts that bespeaks the violation of a\n\nconstitutionally guaranteed right.\").\n\n             There is no doubt that the Rosselló complaint alleges the\n\nviolation        of   a   constitutionally     guaranteed      right,   and   thus,\n\npresents     a    colorable    claim   under    §   1983   for   subject-matter-\n\n\n28\n   The standard for determining the existence of original federal\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343 is, of course, much more\nliberal than the standard for determining the existence of removal\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, at least outside of the\ncomplete preemption context. See BIW Deceived, 824 F.2d at 832.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fjurisdiction purposes. The Federal Constitution protects the right\n\nof all qualified citizens to vote in local elections.                See Bonas,\n\n265 F.3d at 74.         This conclusion, however, does not end our\n\ninquiry.   Having determined that the District Court could have\n\nexercised jurisdiction in this case, we must now inquire whether it\n\nshould have intervened.         See Griffin, 570 F.2d at 170.\n\n           As mentioned above, and discussed more extensively below,\n\n\"[e]lection law, as it pertains to state and local elections, is\n\nfor the most part a preserve that lies within the exclusive\n\ncompetence of the [local] courts.\"           Bonas, 265 F.3d at 74.     We have\n\nthus   stated   that    \"with    only   a    few   narrow   and    well-defined\n\nexceptions, federal courts are not authorized to meddle in local\n\nelections.\"     Id.    This general rule of non-intervention dictates\n\nthat the District Court should not have intervened in this case.\n\nD.   District Court's Decision to Intervene\n\n           As   discussed   above,      we   review   the   decision    of   the\n\nDistrict Court to intervene in this local election dispute for\n\nabuse of discretion.        Klay, 376 F.3d at 1096.               In evaluating\n\nwhether federal intervention into a local election dispute is\n\nappropriate, this Court has inquired into factors such as whether\n\na discrete group of voters has been disenfranchised, whether there\n\nwas a state process in place to handle the question posed by the\n\nplaintiffs, and whether the plaintiffs had availed themselves of\n\nthat state process.      See Griffin, 570 F.2d at 1078-79; Bonas, 265\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fF.3d at 75-76; see also Partido Nuevo Progresista v. Barreto Pérez,\n\n639 F.2d 825, 828 (1st Cir. 1980).            As we stated in Bonas, however,\n\n\"[w]e do not pretend that it is a simple matter to segregate the\n\nrun-of-the-mill electoral disputes from those that appropriately\n\ncan be characterized as harbingers of patent and fundamental\n\nfairness.\"    265 F.3d at 75.         Indeed, \"each case must be evaluated\n\non its own facts.\"        Id.       But, as this Court implied in Barreto\n\nPérez, there is a heavy presumption in favor of non-intervention if\n\nthe party requesting intervention cannot show that a discrete group\n\nof voters has been disenfranchised by the challenged local action.\n\nSee 639 F.2d at 828.\n\n            Here,   the     final    decision    under     Puerto   Rico   law   to\n\nadjudicate all three-mark ballots under one consistent standard\n\ndoes not disenfranchise any Puerto Rico voters -– indeed, it is the\n\nposition    espoused   by     the    Rosselló    Plaintiffs    that   stands     to\n\ndisenfranchise an estimated 28,000 voters.                   Thus, because the\n\nRosselló Plaintiffs cannot claim that federal intervention is\n\nnecessary    because      a     discrete      group   of     voters   has    been\n\ndisenfranchised, and because they cannot allege any other harm\n\nsufficient to overcome the general rule of non-intervention,29 we\n\n\n29\n   We do not foreclose the possibility of a case in which federal\nintervention   would   be   appropriate   without  a   showing   of\ndisenfranchisement. The most obvious example of this would be a\ncase involving vote dilution. See Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 105\n(2000) (per curiam) (\"It must be remembered that 'the right of\nsuffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of\na citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the\n\n                                       -29-\n\fconclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court\n\nto intervene in this local election dispute.\n\n          In Griffin v. Burns, this Court determined that federal\n\nintervention   into   a   state   election   was   appropriate   where   a\n\nsignificant percentage of the qualified and voting electorate was,\n\nin effect, denied its vote.       See 570 F.2d at 1078-79.       In that\n\ncase, although it was undisputed that Rhode Island had issued and\n\ncounted absentee and shut-in ballots in prior primaries, and that\n\nvoters utilizing such ballots had relied on that prior practice and\n\non instructions from state officials in so doing, the Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court said the Rhode Island Secretary of State was without\n\nthe authority to issue and count absentee and shut-in ballots in a\n\nprimary election, effectively disenfranchising all absentee and\n\nshut-in voters that had already voted.       Id. at 1075-76.\n\n\n\nfree exercise of the franchise.'\") (quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377\nU.S. 533, 555 (1964)).\n     Here, however, the Rosselló Plaintiffs' claim that the\nCommission's \"change in the rules\" after the election somehow\n\"diluted\" their vote for their political party of choice is without\nmerit because there was no clear rule prior to the election that\nthe three-mark split ballots were invalid.\n     The Rosselló Plaintiffs' claim that the three-mark split\nballots were adjudicated inconsistently on election night (and\nimmediately thereafter), on the other hand, presents a much\nstronger claim for federal intervention without a showing of\ndisenfranchisement. That claim, however is rendered moot by the\nfact that all ballots will be adjudicated in the same uniform\nmanner during the recount. See Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 106 (per\ncuriam) (addressing situation where \"the standards for accepting or\nrejecting contested ballots might vary not only from county to\ncounty but indeed within a single county from one recount team to\nanother.\").\n\n                                  -30-\n\f              In     Bonas,      this     Court        held     that        complete\n\ndisenfranchisement of all voters, by a municipality's decision not\n\nto   hold     a     municipal    election      at    all,     warranted      federal\n\nintervention.        See 265 F.3d at 75-76.           In that case, after the\n\nvoters   of       North   Smithfield,    Rhode      Island    agreed   in    a   1998\n\nreferendum to transition the Town from an odd-year election cycle\n\nto an even-year cycle, with the first even-year election to take\n\nplace in 2002, town officials, without authorization, held the 1999\n\nelection, but held no election in either 2000 or 2001, effectively\n\ndisenfranchising all persons eligible to vote in the 2001 municipal\n\nelection.      Id. at 71-72.\n\n              In Barreto Pérez, however, this Court determined that\n\nfederal intervention was inappropriate in a case challenging the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico where \"[the] case\n\n[did] not involve a state court order that dis enfranchise[d]\n\nvoters; rather it involve[d] a Commonwealth decision that en\n\nfranchise[d] them.\"           639 F.2d at 828.        That case is remarkably\n\nsimilar to the case at hand.            In that case, the disputed ballots\n\ncontained marks outside the designated spaces and squares, and\n\ntherefore were allegedly invalid under the literal terms of Article\n\n1.033(b) of the Electoral Law of Puerto Rico, which provided that\n\nstray marks such as the ones on the disputed ballots \"shall be null\n\nand void, and deemed unmarked.\"          See id. at 826.       The Administrator\n\nof the Election Commission ruled the ballots invalid, and his\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fdecision was upheld on appeal by the Electoral Review Board.              See\n\nid.    The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico reversed, finding that\n\ndespite 16 L.P.R.A. § 3033(b)'s literal prohibition of counting\n\nsuch   mismarked   ballots,   the    provision   could   be   construed    as\n\npermitting the tallying of such ballots where the \"intent of the\n\nvoter was clear.\"     See id. (discussing Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\ndecision).     The PNP subsequently brought suit in federal court\n\npursuant to § 1983,      alleging that the Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico's \"retroactive\" changing of the law after an election violated\n\nthe plaintiffs' rights not to be deprived of their liberty and\n\nFirst Amendment rights without procedural and substantive due\n\nprocess of law.     Id. at 827.      The district court agreed, stating\n\nthat \"[i]n our opinion the lesson to be learned from Griffin is[]\n\nthat changing the rules of the game after it has been played and\n\nthe score is known, violates fundamental rules of fair play.\"\n\nPartido Nuevo Progresista v. Gerineldo Barreto-Pérez, 507 F. Supp.\n\n1164, 1174 (D. P.R. 1980).     It found that the \"counting of ballots\n\nafter an election which, under the rules prevalent at the time of\n\nthe vote-casting were considered void and invalid, [was] the\n\npractical and functional equivalent of alteration of ballots or of\n\nstuffing the ballot box.\"      Id.     On appeal, this court disagreed.\n\nSee Barreto Pérez, 639 F.2d at 828.\n\n             We emphasized that unlike in Griffin, where the disputed\n\nlocal action involved the disenfranchisement of a discrete group of\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fvoters,    the    local    action   at   issue   in   Barreto   Pérez   actually\n\nenfranchised voters.         See id.     Instead of disenfranchisement, the\n\nplaintiffs in Barreto Pérez claimed that \"votes were 'diluted' by\n\nthe votes of others, not that they themselves were prevented from\n\nvoting.\"    Id.    Moreover, the case was also unlike Griffin in that\n\n\"had   those     casting    absentee     ballots   known   of   their   possible\n\ninvalidity, many might have gone to the polls and voted in person.\"\n\nId. In Barreto Pérez, however, \"there was no such reliance upon an\n\nofficial interpretation of the local election law; no party or\n\nperson is likely to have acted to their detriment by relying upon\n\nthe invalidity of ballots with marks outside the ballots' drawn\n\nrectangles.\"      Id.     The court concluded that the case did not fall\n\n\"within the purview of Griffin but within the area delineated by\n\nthe Second Circuit, in Powell v. Power, 436 F.2d 84 (1970), as\n\ninappropriate for federal court review in a civil rights action,\n\nlest the federal court 'be thrust into the details of virtually\n\nevery election.'        Id. at 86.\"      Id.\n\n            The case presented by the Rosselló Plaintiffs, even\n\nassuming that all claims alleged in their complaint could be\n\nproven, presents even less cause for federal intervention than the\n\ncircumstances which we found lacking in Barrreto Pérez.                     Here,\n\nthere is no clearly articulated Commonwealth policy, much less a\n\nstatute,    to    indicate    the   three-mark     split   vote   ballots    were\n\ninvalid.    At most, the decision of the Commission merely clarified\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fpreviously     unsettled      law.         Furthermore,      this     case    is\n\ndistinguishable from Griffin and Bonas, because \"this case does not\n\ninvolve a state court order that dis enfranchise[d] voters; rather\n\nit involves a Commonwealth decision that en franchises them.\"\n\nBarreto Pérez, 639 F.2d at 828.             Therefore, it was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for the District Court to determine that the Rosselló\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint could possibly state a claim with grounds for\n\nfederal intervention, and as a result, it was necessarily an abuse\n\nof   discretion   for   the   District     Court   to   grant   a   preliminary\n\ninjunction preserving jurisdiction in a case in which our Circuit\n\nprecedent clearly required the District Court not to intervene.\n\n                              IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n            For the above reasons:\n\n            The Petitions for Writ of Mandamus are DENIED, as the\n\nDistrict Court has no choice but to remand the Suárez action to the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico in light our disposition of the\n\nRosselló appeal.\n\n             We VACATE the issuance of the preliminary injunction\n\nwith the direction that the District Court dismiss with prejudice\n\nall claims in the Rosselló complaint relating to the adjudication\n\nof   the   three-mark   ballots,     and    all    claims   relating    to   the\n\nsimultaneous general canvass/recount issue.             The District Court is\n\nalso directed to dismiss without prejudice the claims relating to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fthe absentee ballots, and any alleged violations of Puerto Rico Law\n\n197.\n\n            Because   the   supplemental     materials    proffered   by   the\n\nappellants   are   unnecessary    to   our    decision,    the   motions    to\n\nsupplement the record on appeal are DENIED AS MOOT.              We likewise\n\nDENY the appellees' request for judicial notice.\n\n            Leave to file an amicus brief is GRANTED to the Puerto\n\nRico Association of Mayors, the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Employee\n\nAssociation and the Board of Directors of Cumbre Social, the\n\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (oversized brief), Efraím\n\nCintrón García, and Gerardo Ramírez.

Gore, 531 U.S.\n\n98 (2000), inapplicable.     The present circumstances do not support\n\na justiciable federal vote-dilution claim by voters who cast\n\nballots that were clearly valid under rules changed after the\n\nelection.      See   Bush,   531   U.S.   at   106-107   (criticizing   as\n\ninconsistent with equal protection Miami-Dade County's alteration,\n\nduring recount, between 1990 rules for ballot validity and new, ad\n\nhoc rules).    What happened here was not a change in Puerto Rico's\n\nestablished rules with regard to three-mark split vote ballots, but\n\nrather a clarification of the status of the ballots, whose validity\n\nor invalidity had not before been clearly established as a matter\n\nof Puerto Rico election policy.\n\n            More important in my opinion, the preeminent truth to be\n\ngleaned from the Bush opinion is that the United States is, first\n\nand foremost, a nation of laws and that the meaning of these laws\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fis interpreted by the courts, whose rulings become the Law of the\n\nLand.    Thus, notwithstanding the unprecedented nature of the Bush\n\nv. Gore decision, issued in the face of a very divided nation, its\n\nbinding    finality       was    accepted      by   the   citizenry     as    a    whole,\n\nirrespective of individual or collective disagreement with its\n\noutcome.     Although undoubtedly there was much dissonance, as there\n\nmay   well     presently    be    in     Puerto     Rico,   the    nation     turned    a\n\nfigurative page and acquiesced.                     This response reflected our\n\nnation's longstanding recognition that:\n\n               [c]ompliance    with    decisions    of   [the\n               judiciary],   as   the   constitutional  organ\n               [interpreting] the supreme Law of the Land,\n               has often, throughout our history, depended on\n               active support by state and local authorities.\n               It presupposes such support.\n\nCooper    v.

I urge the People of\n\nPuerto Rico, and the parties in these appeals, to remember these\n\nwords as they stand at this important crossroads in our shared\n\nhistory as a society joined by our respect for democratic values,\n\n\n\n                                          -37-\n\funderpinned by the rule of law.        For, as Justice Frankfurter so\n\nably stated:\n\n          [F]rom their own experience and their deep\n          reading in history, the Founders knew that Law\n          alone saves a society from being rent by\n          internecine strife or ruled by mere brute\n          power however disguised . . . . The duty to\n          abstain from resistance to \"the supreme Law of\n          the Land\" . . . as declared by the organ of\n          our Government for ascertaining it, does not\n          require immediate approval of it nor does it\n          deny the right of dissent. Criticism need not\n          be stilled. [However] active obstruction or\n          defiance is barred . . . .\n\nId. at 23-25.\n\n          As    important   as   the   outcome   of   this   election   may\n\npresently be, there are more fundamental issues at stake.\n\n\n\n\n                      \"Concurrence to follow.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  -38-\n\f              HOWARD, Circuit Judge (in additional concurrence).\n\n              I have joined in the court's disposition of these cases.\n\nI am less sure about our resolution of certain, discrete issues\n\nraised by the Rosselló appeal, and I identify those concerns here.\n\n              1.   The district court did not categorize the order\n\npreventing the Commission from adjudicating the ballots.                    See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 65(d); Ben David v. Travisono, 495 F.2d 562, 563 (1st\n\nCir.    1974).      As    I    see    it,    the   order     might   plausibly   be\n\ncharacterized      as    an    All   Writs   Act     Injunction,     a   traditional\n\ninjunction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65, or a case management order.\n\nUnder the first two possibilities, we have appellate jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1); under the third we do not.                         See\n\nMatter of City of Springfield, 818 F.2d 565, 567-68 (7th Cir.\n\n1987).\n\n              In the end, we need not decide this issue.                 Even if the\n\norder    is    properly       characterized     as    only    a   case    management\n\ndirective, we are entitled to review it under our mandamus power.\n\nSee Ramírez v. Rivera-Dueño, 861 F.2d 328, 334 (1st Cir. 1988).                  In\n\nmy view, we should do so, given the jurisdictional issue at the\n\nheart of this case, the coercive and intrusive nature of the order,\n\nthe federalism and comity concerns that it raises, and the highly\n\ncharged circumstances in which it was issued.                     And because the\n\nquestion of the order's propriety cannot be decided without an\n\nanalysis of whether the Rosselló action is justiciable, I concur in\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fthe decision to proceed directly to the merits and to order the\n\naction dismissed.\n\n             2. Notwithstanding our statement that the district court\n\nhas federal question jurisdiction over the case, we have concluded\n\nthat   the   district   court   abused    its   discretion   by   asserting\n\njurisdiction over it.      I would rather we characterize the matter\n\nsomewhat differently.      There is no question, of course, that the\n\ndistrict court has subject matter jurisdiction of a federal civil\n\nrights claim pleaded under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.         The issue is whether\n\nthe pleaded federal claim is justiciable.         This question is not a\n\nmatter of discretion; it is an issue of law.         See Bonas v. Town of\n\nN. Smithfield, 265 F.3d 69, 73-75 (1st Cir. 2001).           And it is an\n\nissue of law that implicates the court's \"jurisdiction\" only in the\n\nsense that justiciability is regarded as a jurisdictional doctrine.\n\nSee id.\n\n             3.   Finally, citing Partido Nuevo Progresista v. Barreto\n\nPérez, 639 F.2d 825, 827-28 (1st Cir. 1980), we have emphasized\n\nthat the \"change of rules\" claim fails because, even if there was\n\nsuch a change, it would result in enfranchising some voters rather\n\nthan disenfranchising them.      But after Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98\n\n(2000), I cannot discount the possibility that a viable federal\n\nvote-dilution claim might lie in some circumstances where a post-\n\nelection rule change has the effect of causing previously invalid\n\nballots to be adjudicated.       I do, however, think that the vote-\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fdilution claims pleaded in this case were properly rejected because\n\nI agree with Judge Torruella that, on the pleadings and the record,\n\nonly one conclusion is possible:   the Commission's ruling involved\n\nonly the clarification of previously unsettled law.    In my view,\n\nthis is not a \"change in the rules\" sufficient to implicate federal\n\ninterests.\n\n\n\n\n                               -41-\n\f-42-\n\f",

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico held\n\ngeneral elections on November 2, 2004 for a variety of offices,\n\nincluding Governor and Resident Commissioner.    Although over two\n\nmillion votes were cast, preliminary results indicate that the\n\ncandidates from the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\") and the New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\"), Aníbal Acevedo Vilá (\"Acevedo\") and\n\nPedro Rosselló González (\"Rosselló\"), respectively, are separated\n\nby a very narrow margin -- a few thousand votes.    This extremely\n\nclose election has raised emotions in Puerto Rico and spawned the\n\nactions that are before us.\n\n          Plaintiffs-Appellees include NPP candidate Rosselló and\n\na number of voters who voted for him in the November 2, 2004\n\nelection (collectively, \"the Rosselló Plaintiffs\").1   Defendants-\n\nAppellants include PDP candidate Acevedo, the Puerto Rico Electoral\n\nCommission (\"the Commission\"), the president of the Commission,\n\nAurelio Gracia Morales (\"Gracia\"), and its three Commissioners\n\n(collectively, \"the Acevedo Defendants\").2   On November 10, 2004,\n\nthe Rosselló Plaintiffs filed suit (\"the Rosselló action\") in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico (\"the\n\n\n\n1\n   Luis Fortuño, the NPP candidate for Resident Commissioner, is\nalso a Plaintiff-Appellee.\n2\n   Sila M.

On November 24, 2004, the District\n\nCourt issued an order that the Commission identify and set aside,\n\nbut not consider, the contested ballots.           The Acevedo Defendants\n\nseek review of that order.\n\n          Also   part   of   this    appeal   is    an   action   filed   on\n\nNovember 16, 2004 in the Court of First Instance for San Juan,\n\nPuerto Rico, the local trial court, by four voters (collectively,\n\n\"the Suárez Plaintiffs\") who claim to have cast, and want to\n\nestablish the validity of, the ballots at issue in the Rosselló\n\naction (\"the Suárez action\").3      After the Court of First Instance\n\ndismissed the Suárez action on November 18, 2004 as moot, the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico (\"Supreme Court\") assumed jurisdiction\n\nover the case.   Yet, before the Supreme Court took any meaningful\n\naction, the case was removed to the District Court.           Motions were\n\npromptly filed to remand the action to the Supreme Court, and we\n\nhave since been asked to exercise our power of mandamus and\n\ninstruct the District Court to remand the action.\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The following are the defendants in the Suárez action: (1) the\nCommission, (2) the President of the Commission, (3) the three\nCommissioners, (4) Rosselló, and (5) the NPP.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                             I.   BACKGROUND\n\nA.    The November 2, 2004 Election\n\n            On November 2, 2004, general elections were held for the\n\noffices of Governor and Resident Commissioner.4           The ballot that\n\nwas to be cast in connection with those two offices (\"the ballot\")\n\nlisted only the candidates for those two offices under the insignia\n\nof their respective political parties.5        Puerto Rico's three major\n\nparties had candidates on the ballot for Governor:            (1) Rosselló,\n\nfrom the NPP; (2) Acevedo, from the PDP; and (3) Rubén Berríos\n\nMartínez, from the Independence Party (\"PIP\").            The parties also\n\nhad candidates on the ballot for Resident Commissioner.\n\n            The   ballot   instructed    voters   to   vote   for    only   one\n\ncandidate for Governor and one for Resident Commissioner.                    On\n\nelection day, voters filled in the ballots in the following ways:\n\n(1) by placing a mark under a party insignia, thereby voting for\n\nall of the candidates in that party's column (\"a straight vote\");\n\n(2) by placing a mark next to the name of each desired candidate\n\nbut not under a party insignia; (3) by placing a mark under a party\n\ninsignia and next to a desired candidate of a party other than the\n\none that had its insignia previously marked;6 or (4) by placing a\n\n\n4\n     The Resident Commissioner           is   Puerto    Rico's      non-voting\nrepresentative in Congress.\n5\n     The ballot is reproduced in Appendix A of this Opinion.\n6\n  The Commission has determined that such a ballot reflects a vote\nfor the desired candidate and the remaining candidate under the\n\n                                   -5-\n\fmark    under    a    party     insignia     and      marks    next   to   two   desired\n\ncandidates associated with a party or parties other than the one\n\nthat had its insignia previously marked (\"a three-mark split\n\nvote\").7\n\n            Prior to the November 2, 2004 election, the Commission,\n\nacting pursuant to its statutory authority, enacted regulations\n\nwhich    outlined         the   procedures    that      were    to    be   followed   in\n\nadjudicating ballots, that is, in determining the validity of\n\nballots    and       in   awarding   votes       to    the    deserving    candidates.8\n\nAccording to the procedures in place during the election in issue,\n\neach ballot was to be initially adjudicated, and each vote was to\n\nbe tallied, at the polling location at which it was cast.9                            If\n\n\n\nparty insignia.\n7\n   As determined by the Commission, see infra, a three-mark split\nvote ballot reflects a vote for the two marked candidates, as well\nas a vote for the party. A vote for a party on a three-mark ballot\nis credited to the party itself (and not to any of its candidates)\nfor purposes of its reclassification as a \"principal party,\" which\nentitles it to certain benefits, including the right to receive\nfunding.   See 16 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 3003, 3116.      A party is a\nprincipal party if, for example, it \"obtained a number of votes\nunder . . . its insignia on the ballot of Governor and Resident\nCommissioner[] of not less [than] seven (7) percent of the total\nnumber of votes cast for all the parties' insignias in the\npreceding general election.\"    § 3003(42) (second alteration in\noriginal).\n8\n    See 16 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 3007(k), 3013(l).\n9\n    Each ballot was to be adjudicated by a group of three\ninspectors, consisting of one representative from each of the three\nprincipal parties. If the inspectors were unable to agree, there\nwere additional levels of review at each polling location. The\nadjudicatory bodies at each level were comprised of one\n\n                                           -6-\n\fthose reviewing a ballot at a polling location were unable to\n\nunanimously agree on the adjudication of the ballot, it was to\n\nremain unadjudicated and be sent to the Commission, along with the\n\nresults of the adjudicated ballots, for review. The Commission was\n\nthen to engage in a \"general canvass,\" during which the results of\n\nthe adjudicated ballots were to be checked and the contested\n\nballots were to be counted or rejected according to the judgment of\n\nthe three Commissioners -- each of whom represented one of the\n\nthree principal parties.10   If they could not reach a unanimous\n\nconsensus, the ballot was to be forwarded to the president of the\n\nCommission for a final determination.11\n\n          Over two million votes were cast in the November 2, 2004\n\ngubernatorial election. Within seventy-two hours of the closing of\n\nthe polls, the Commission issued a preliminary report that Acevedo\n\nwas leading Rosselló by 3,880 votes.   As a result of the closeness\n\nof the election, and in accordance with its regulations, the\n\nCommission, on November 4, 2004, ordered that a recount occur\n\nsimultaneously with the general canvass.    But, the next day, the\n\n\n\n\nrepresentative from each of the three principal parties.\n10\n   Although this is a somewhat simplified account of the general\ncanvass procedures, the omitted details are irrelevant to this\nappeal.\n11\n   \"Any party affected by a resolution, ruling or order of the []\nCommission may, within the ten (10) days following the notice\nthereof, appeal to the Court of First Instance . . . .\" 16 P.R.\nLaws Ann. § 3016a.\n\n                               -7-\n\fpresident of the Commission, Gracia, announced that the recount\n\nwould not begin until the completion of the general canvass.\n\n           During the election, thousands of three-mark split vote\n\nballots -– as many as 28,000 -– were cast.             Apparently, the vast\n\nmajority of these ballots contained a mark under the insignia of\n\nthe PIP and marks next to the two PDP candidates.12\n\n           A number of the three-mark ballots were adjudicated at\n\nthe polling centers on election night.13          And, for the first two or\n\nthree days of the general canvass, which began on November 8, 2004,\n\nsome of the three-mark ballots that had been contested at the\n\npolling    centers,   and   thus,   had     not    been    adjudicated,     were\n\ndetermined to be valid.     But, on November 11, 2004, a dispute arose\n\nwhen the NPP Commissioner took the position that the ballots in\n\nquestion   were   void.     Because   the    PDP     and    PIP   Commissioners\n\ndisagreed, the issue was referred to Gracia. On November 12, 2004,\n\nGracia decided that the ballots contained valid votes for both the\n\nmarked candidates     and   the   marked    party,    and    later   that   day,\n\n\n\n12\n   It has been alleged that, on some of the three-mark split vote\nballots: (1) the mark under the PIP insignia was made in pencil\nwhile the marks next to the PDP candidates were made in pen; and\n(2) the marks next to the PDP candidates were noticeably dissimilar\nfrom the mark made under the PIP insignia.\n13\n   There is, however, a dispute as to whether these ballots were\nadjudicated in a consistent fashion. It has been alleged that some\nof the ballots were declared void, some were adjudicated as\ncontaining valid straight votes for the PIP candidates, and some\nwere adjudicated as containing valid split votes for the PDP\ncandidates, as well as the PIP.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fGracia's decision was memorialized in a written resolution of the\n\nCommission.\n\n             1.   The Federal and State Court Actions\n\n             On November 10, 2004, the Rosselló Plaintiffs filed a\n\ncomplaint against the Acevedo Defendants in the District Court that\n\nasserted various federal constitutional claims under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§    1983   arising   out   of   the   November    2,   2004   election.   On\n\nNovember 12, 2004, an amended complaint was filed alleging that the\n\nCommission's decision to (1) regard the three-mark ballots as valid\n\nand count the votes contained therein, (2) suspend the recount\n\npending completion of the general canvass,14 and (3) disregard\n\ncertain late-filed absentee ballots15 violated a variety of their\n\nfederal constitutional rights.16             The Rosselló Plaintiffs sought\n\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the above\n\n\n\n\n14\n   The Rosselló Plaintiffs, by their own concession, \"have achieved\ncomplete and substantial relief\" on this claim, and therefore, we\nneed not give it any further consideration.\n15\n    The Rosselló Plaintiffs have conceded, both in their opening\nbrief and at oral argument, that they \"have achieved complete and\nsubstantial relief\" from the Commission with respect to this claim.\nTo be sure, there is still a question as to whether the Commission\nwill follow through with the relief it has promised.       But, any\nclaim concerning this open question is not yet ripe.\n16\n    In addition, the Rosselló Plaintiffs have alleged that the\nCommission violated their constitutional rights when it made\n\"substantial changes\" to the rules governing the election after the\nvotes had been cast.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fchallenges.17    The   District    Court   scheduled   a   hearing   for\n\nNovember 18, 2004.18\n\n          Meanwhile, on November 16, 2004, the Suárez Plaintiffs,\n\nwho claim to have cast three-mark ballots, filed suit in the Court\n\nof First Instance seeking, among other things, a declaratory\n\njudgment as to the validity of the three-mark ballots and an\n\ninjunction requiring the Commission to adjudicate the ballots.19\n\nThe Suárez Plaintiffs insisted that an invalidation of the ballots\n\nwould deprive them of their right to vote and, thus, their \"right\n\nto due process of law and to equal protection under the law.\"20\n\n\n\n\n17\n   The Rosselló Plaintiffs also sought injunctive and declaratory\nrelief in connection with their claim that Puerto Rico Law No. 197,\n1 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 456 et seq., \"is unconstitutional to the extent\nthat it purports to authorize or allow the transition process [for\nthe next governor] to proceed before the next governor . . . has\nbeen determined.\" We need not address this issue. The District\nCourt denied preliminary injunctive relief on this claim, and the\nRosselló Plaintiffs did not bother to appeal that ruling.\nMoreover, whether Law No. 197 allows the transition process to go\nforward during a recount is a question of local law that will soon\nbe mooted by the recount.\n18\n    We note that the Rosselló Plaintiffs chose to challenge the\ndecisions of the Commission in federal court rather than exercise\ntheir statutory right to appeal to the Court of First Instance.\nSee 16 P.R. Laws Ann. § 3016a.\n19\n    The Suárez Plaintiffs also sought declaratory and injunctive\nrelief requiring the Commission to (1) complete the general canvass\nbefore conducting a recount and (2) certify the winning\ngubernatorial candidate by December 22, 2004.\n20\n     The Suárez Plaintiffs filed this action even though the\nCommission had already decided that the three-mark ballots are\nvalid.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f            The Court of First Instance dismissed the Suárez action\n\nwithout prejudice on November 18, 2004 on the ground that no actual\n\ncontroversy existed because the Commission had already upheld the\n\nvalidity of the ballots.21      That same day, the Suárez Plaintiffs,\n\nconcerned that the validity of the ballots had not been adequately\n\nestablished, requested that the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico review\n\nthe Court of First Instance's dismissal.         The Supreme Court agreed\n\nto do so.    On the morning of November 20, 2004, the Commissioner of\n\nthe NPP and the NPP itself, defendants in the Suárez action,\n\nremoved the action to the District Court.             Notice of removal was\n\nfiled with the Supreme Court at 11:48 a.m.        In response, the Suárez\n\nPlaintiffs and a defendant in the Suárez action, alleging various\n\nprocedural    defects   in   removal,22   as   well   as   lack   of   federal\n\njurisdiction, moved the District Court to remand. Soon thereafter,\n\ntwo mandamus petitions were filed in this court, each one seeking\n\nan order requiring that the District Court remand the action.\n\n             Despite the removal, the Supreme Court purported to enter\n\na judgment on the Suárez action on the evening of November 20,\n\n2004.   By a vote of four to three, it ordered that the three-mark\n\nballots were to be adjudicated as containing valid votes for the\n\n\n21\n   Significantly, the Commissioner of the NPP, a defendant in the\nSuárez action, had requested dismissal on several grounds, one of\nwhich was lack of jurisdiction because the Commission had already\nadjudicated the contested ballots as valid.\n22\n    Because of the disposition of the removal issue on other\ngrounds, we need not address the alleged procedural defects.\n\n                                   -11-\n\fmarked candidates for Governor and Resident Commissioner, as well\n\nas the identified party for purposes of maintaining its principal\n\nparty status.    See supra note 7.\n\n            On November 20, 2004, the District Court issued an order\n\nin   the   Rosselló    action     that   the   Commission    \"set   aside    and\n\nsegregate\" the three-mark ballots and refrain from announcing the\n\nwinner of the gubernatorial election.           Then, on November 24, 2004,\n\nthe District Court issued an order that:               (1) stated that the\n\nSupreme Court's judgment was void because the removal rendered the\n\nSupreme Court without jurisdiction to enter the judgment;23 and (2)\n\nordered that a recount be conducted by \"counting the number of\n\n[three-mark] split ballots, identifying and segregating the same,\n\nbut not adjudicating the ballots.\"             (Emphasis in original.)       The\n\nAcevedo Defendants appealed from the order that the three-vote\n\nballots not be adjudicated.\n\n                      II.   THE PETITIONS FOR MANDAMUS\n\n            We begin with the two Emergency Petitions for Writ of\n\nMandamus that    request     we    exercise    our   power   of   mandamus   and\n\ninstruct the District Court to remand the Suárez action to the\n\n\n23\n    We agree with the District Court that the Supreme Court's\njudgment was void. The governing statute provides that the filing\nof \"a copy of the notice [of removal] with the clerk of [the] State\ncourt . . . effect[s] the removal and the State court shall proceed\nno further unless and until the case is remanded.\" 28 U.S.C. §\n1446(d) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court received notice of the\nremoval at 11:48 a.m. on November 20, 2004 but did not issue\njudgment until that evening. The judgment is thus, as the District\nCourt found, a nullity.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fPuerto Rico courts.        These mandamus petitions contest the validity\n\nof removal on two principal grounds: (1) the absence of federal\n\nquestion jurisdiction over the Suárez action, and (2) the failure\n\nof the removing parties to obtain the consent of all Suárez action\n\ndefendants    (including         Petitioners)    to    removal.        Since   both\n\npetitions are substantially the same, they will be discussed as\n\none.\n\n             We note at the outset that we have given the District\n\nCourt ample opportunity to decide whether removal of the Suárez\n\naction was proper, and despite the time-sensitive nature of this\n\ncase, and three weeks of hearings on the merits of the Rosselló\n\naction which has been consolidated with this case for appeal, we\n\nare now faced with the extreme decision of whether we should compel\n\nremand through a Writ of Mandamus.\n\n             In order to stave off the need for mandamus, we invited\n\nthe District       Court    to   address   these      mandamus   petitions.      In\n\nresponse,    the    court    appended      a   footnote    to    the   opinion   of\n\nNovember 30, 2004 in which the District Court asserted jurisdiction\n\nover the parallel federal case.            Pedro Rosselló, et al. v. Sila M.\n\nCalderón, et al., No. 04-2251, slip op. at 3, n.2 (D.P.R. Nov. 30,\n\n2004).      The footnote indicated that a hearing was needed to\n\nproperly evaluate the jurisdictional issues raised in the pending\n\nmotions to remand.          Specifically, the District Court indicated:\n\n(1) that the Suárez Plaintiffs' complaint had alleged violations of\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fdue process and equal protection without specifying whether the\n\nsource   of    these    protections    was     the   Commonwealth   or   Federal\n\nConstitution; (2) that federal jurisdiction might be required under\n\nFranchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110990\"><a href=\"/opinion/110990/franchise-tax-bd-of-cal-v-construction-laborers-vacation-trust-for/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1983); and finally, (3) that the legal interests of\n\nsome Suárez Defendants might require their realignment with the\n\nplaintiffs in that action.\n\n              Following a hearing on December 8, 2004, the District\n\nCourt issued an opinion resolving various challenges to the removal\n\njurisdiction. Manuel R. Suárez, et al. v. Comisión Estatal de\n\nElecciones,     et     al.,   No.   04-2288,    slip   op.   (D.P.R.   Dec.   10,\n\n2004)(hereinafter \"Remand Opinion\"). In that opinion, the District\n\nCourt held that \"examining the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the defendants . . . an overvote issue may exist[] in violation\n\nof Due Process and Equal Protection principles under the case of\n\nBonas v. Town of North Smithfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199603\"><a href=\"/opinion/199603/bonas-v-north-smithfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2001).\"\n\nRemand Opinion at 12-13; see also Bonas, 265 F.3d at 73-74.24\n\nAlthough it evaluated and rejected the majority of the arguments\n\nagainst removal before it, the District Court still has not made a\n\nfinal decision on the ultimate question of whether to remand the\n\ncase to the Puerto Rico courts.          Nevertheless, the District Court\n\ndetermined in its December 10 opinion that a federal question had\n\n\n\n24\n   We address the applicability of Bonas below in our discussion\nof the Rosselló action.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fbeen presented in the Suárez complaint.     That determination was\n\nplainly erroneous, and our resolution of the Rosselló action today\n\nis decisive of the motion to remand.     Because the District Court\n\nplainly erred, and because every additional day spent adjudicating\n\nthis issue before the District Court or on appeal before this court\n\nincreases the risk of irreparable harm, our intervention by Writ of\n\nMandamus would be appropriate.\n\nA.   Availability of Mandamus\n\n          Although it is an extraordinary remedy, mandamus can be\n\nappropriate in those rare cases in which the issuance (or non-\n\nissuance) of an order (1) raises a question about the limits of\n\njudicial power, (2) poses a risk of irreparable harm to the\n\nappellant, and (3) is plainly erroneous.         See Christopher v.\n\nStanley-Bostich, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199287\"><a href=\"/opinion/199287/christopher-v-stanley-bostitch/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99 (1st Cir. 2001).    Moreover,\n\n\"the case for mandamus is particularly compelling where the order\n\nposes an elemental question of judicial authority.\" Id. at 99-100.\n\nThe instant petitions clearly meet the first requirement, as they\n\nconcern the boundaries of the District Court's power to remove\n\ncases from Commonwealth courts.     See, e.g.,   Hernández-Agosto v.\n\nRomero-Barceló, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444350\"><a href=\"/opinion/444350/miguel-hernandez-agosto-president-of-the-senate-of-puerto-rico-on-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1984) (issuing mandamus\n\nto remand improperly removed action to Puerto Rico court). Second,\n\nthe risk of irreparable harm from the continued pendency of removal\n\njurisdiction is acute:    there are now fewer than three weeks\n\nremaining before inauguration day on January 2, 2005.     Third, as\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\felucidated below, we find that the District Court's failure to\n\nremand is plainly erroneous because the Suárez Plaintiffs presented\n\nno claim of right arising under federal law.         See 28 U.S.C. § 1441.\n\nB.    Validity of Removal\n\n            We find that the exercise of removal jurisdiction is\n\nplainly erroneous in this case because no federal question was\n\npresented in the Suárez action either procedurally (because the\n\nfour corners of the complaint do not plead a federal question) or\n\nsubstantively (because we have decided in the Rosselló action that\n\nthe   federal    courts   will   not    intervene   in   a   local   electoral\n\ndispute).   Because we find that remand to the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt is necessary due to the absence of a federal question, we do\n\nnot address the petitioners' second argument, that removal was\n\nimproper because it did not receive the consent of all defendants\n\nto the Suárez action.\n\n            1.   Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule\n\n            A case may be removed to federal court if it presents a\n\n\"claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of\n\nthe United States.\"       28 U.S.C. § 1441(b).       \"The Supreme Court of\n\nthe United States has made clear that, in deciding (for removal\n\npurposes) whether a case presents a federal 'claim or right,' a\n\ncourt is to ask whether the plaintiff's claim to relief rests upon\n\na federal right, and the court is to look only to plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint to find the answer.\" Hernández-Agosto v.

The\n\nexistence of a federal defense is not sufficient for removal\n\njurisdiction.   Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 10-11.       Thus, we must\n\nturn to the Suárez complaint to ascertain whether, within its four\n\ncorners, a federal \"claim or right\" has been presented.              Our\n\nevaluation centers on the complaint's allegations of violations of\n\n\"due process\" and \"equal protection.\"25            These   claims do not\n\nexplicitly   state   whether   the   source   of   these   constitutional\n\nprotections is the Commonwealth or the Federal Constitution.26\n\n\n25\n    Respondents also note that the Suárez complaint attached and\nmade reference to the complaint filed four days earlier in federal\ncourt by Rosselló.    No federal claim can be inferred from this\nreference to the federal action; rather, it was included in the\nSuárez complaint as factual background. See Suárez complaint at\npara. 8.    Further, even assuming it is proper for us to look\noutside the four corners of the Suárez complaint to the previously-\nfiled federal action, as we discuss below, the Rosselló complaint\ndoes not state a claim warranting federal intervention into this\nlocal electoral dispute, and therefore cannot be considered\nsufficiently substantial to give rise to removal jurisdiction under\nFranchise Tax Board.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Tex.\n1999), a federal district court evaluated a situation very much\nlike the one we face here. In Dardeau, a complaint was filed in\nstate court that made explicit reference only to state law, but\nalso claimed a violation of \"due process.\" Ambiguity with regard\nto the source of this right was heightened relative to our case\nbecause, while those words appear in the United States\nConstitution, the Texas Constitution uses the phrase \"due course of\nlaw.\" Id. at 732. For reasons substantially similar to those we\nset out below, the district court nevertheless interpreted the\ncomplaint narrowly to find no federal cause of action to sustain\nremoval jurisdiction. Id. at 730-34.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f          Read as a whole, we cannot say that this complaint\n\npresents a claim under the Federal Constitution.                    No explicit\n\nreference to the United States Constitution or any other federal\n\nlaw is contained in the complaint; instead, all references are to\n\nPuerto   Rico   state       laws,   regulations,       and   the    Commonwealth\n\nConstitution.    Specifically, paragraph 11 of the complaint bases\n\nthe Suárez Plaintiffs' claims in the right to vote guaranteed in\n\nArticle II, Section 2, of the Commonwealth Constitution.                        The\n\ncomplaint's subsequent references to the plaintiffs' rights to vote\n\nand to have their votes counted in accordance with equal protection\n\nand due process, while not expressly premised on the Puerto Rico\n\nConstitution, logically refer back to the antecedent citation to\n\nArticle II, Section 2 of the Commonwealth Constitution.\n\n          Moreover, it is well-settled that \"the plaintiff [is] the\n\nmaster of the claim; he or she may avoid federal jurisdiction by\n\nexclusive reliance on state law.\"            Caterpillar Inc. v.

Federal Ingredient\n\n            Respondents also argue that even in the absence of a\n\nclaim arising under federal law on the face of plaintiffs' well-\n\npleaded complaint, federal removal jurisdiction is still proper\n\nunder the Supreme Court's statement in Franchise Tax Board that\n\nremoval    would       be    appropriate         \"if    a   well-pleaded     complaint\n\nestablished that [the plaintiff's] right to relief under state law\n\nrequires resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\" 463\n\nU.S. at 13.        Under this \"federal ingredient\" doctrine, a case\n\narises    under    federal      law    for       purposes   of     removal   when    \"the\n\nplaintiff's right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a\n\nsubstantial question of federal law.\"                   Id. at 27-28.\n\n            Federal ingredient jurisdiction remains \"controversial,\"\n\nAlmond, 212 F.3d at 23, because\n\n            [t]he Supreme Court has periodically affirmed\n            this basis for jurisdiction in the abstract\n            . . ., occasionally cast doubt upon it, rarely\n            applied it in practice, and left the very\n            scope of the concept unclear.

With\n\nthis caution in mind, we turn to the respondents' argument.\n\n           Respondents        hang    their   jurisdictional     hat   on   two\n\ndoctrines that they allege exist in the caselaw of the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme Court.     The first stems from the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt's    statements    in    a     1964   case   that,   in   accepting    the\n\nCommonwealth's Bill of Rights, the United States Congress \"was to\n\npresume -- and in fact it is so and ought to be -- that the public\n\npowers and the courts of the Commonwealth shall render effective\n\nand construe the provisions of the [Puerto Rico] Bill of Rights in\n\na manner consistent with the protection afforded . . . by the same\n\nor similar provisions of the Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nR.C.A.

The second comes into play when a federal\n\ncourt certifies a question of state law to the Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt.    According to the Supreme Court:\n\n            [W]hen the question before us refers to the\n            validity of a state law under a clause of the\n            state constitution that is similar to a clause\n            in the federal Constitution . . . the issue is\n            a mixed question of federal and state rights\n            that must be resolved by the federal court,\n            because the validity of the statute under the\n\n                                       -21-\n\f            federal Constitution necessarily disposes of\n            the question under state law. . . . In these\n            circumstances we must refuse certification,\n            since our decision would be only advisory.\n\nPan Am. Computer Corp. v. Data Gen. Corp., 112 D.P.R. 780, 793-94\n\n(1982)    (translation    supplied    by    this    court).        According    to\n\nRespondents, these two provisions mean that the Supreme Court's\n\nevaluation of the Suárez Plaintiffs' claims under the due process\n\nand equal protection doctrines of the Commonwealth Constitution\n\nwill require the resolution of a federal question:                   whether the\n\nparallel provisions of the United States Constitution would be\n\nviolated by the acts in question.          Accordingly, Respondents argue,\n\nthe District Court has removal jurisdiction under the federal\n\ningredient doctrine.\n\n            These arguments fundamentally misconstrue the federal\n\ningredient doctrine.       Whether a state court will adopt as the\n\nmeaning    of   the    state's      constitution      the       federal     courts'\n\ninterpretation    of     parallel     language      in    the     United     States\n\nConstitution is a matter of state law.             See, e.g., Nieves, 7 F.3d\n\nat 274.    Federal law does not compel such an outcome.                    Thus, a\n\ndetermination    of    whether   a    violation      of     the    Puerto     Rican\n\nConstitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection has\n\noccurred does not \"require resolution\" of whether the conduct\n\ncomplained of would violate the Federal Constitution.

First\n\nNat'l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102703\"><a href=\"/opinion/102703/gully-v-first-nat-bank-in-meridian/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112-13 (1936) (\"To bring a case within\n\n                                     -22-\n\fthe   [removal]    statute,      a    right    or    immunity    created    by   the\n\nConstitution . . . must be an element, and an essential one, of the\n\nplaintiff's     cause   of    action.\")       (emphasis    added).     To   decide\n\notherwise would mean that any case brought under a provision of the\n\nPuerto Rico Constitution that mirrors the language of the United\n\nStates   Constitution         could    be     removed     into   federal    court.\n\nAccordingly, we find that removal jurisdiction over the Suárez\n\naction is lacking, and it must be remanded to the Commonwealth\n\ncourt from which it was removed.              28 U.S.C. § 1447.\n\n           4.     Effect of the Rosselló Decision\n\n           Lastly,      and    perhaps      most    significantly,   the    Suárez\n\ncomplaint cannot be said to state a federal question, because, as\n\nwe will discuss now, the federal courts will not intervene in a\n\nlocal electoral dispute such as this.               Although we find that it was\n\nplain error for the District Court not to remand the Suárez action\n\nback to the Puerto Rico courts on the basis of the well-pleaded\n\ncomplaint rule, and therefore we could issue a Writ of Mandamus\n\ncompelling remand, we realize that the District Court now has the\n\nbenefit of both our above discussion and our decision in the\n\nRosselló action.        Therefore, we are confident that the District\n\nCourt will immediately remand the Suárez action back to the Supreme\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico without the need for mandamus.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\f             III.   APPEAL OF THE NON-ADJUDICATION ORDER\n\n            We now turn to the appeal of the non-adjudication order\n\nthat is before us in connection with the Rosselló action.            We have\n\nrepeatedly held that federal courts \"normally may not . . .\n\nundertake     the   resolution    of         'garden    variety     election\n\nirregularities.'\" Bonas, 265 F.3d at 74 (quoting Griffin v.

We have departed from this\n\ngeneral rule of non-intervention on only two occasions. See Bonas,\n\n265 F.3d at 75-76; Griffin, 570 F.2d at 1079.              As we elucidate\n\nbelow, those two cases are easily distinguished from the case at\n\nhand.   Here, Circuit precedent demands application of the general\n\nprinciple   of   non-intervention,     and    therefore,   we     vacate   the\n\nissuance of the preliminary injunction and direct the District\n\nCourt to dismiss the case.\n\nA.   Nature of Our Review\n\n            The Acevedo Defendants are presently before us seeking\n\nreview of the District Court's issuance of a preliminary injunction\n\nto segregate, but not adjudicate, all three-mark split vote ballots\n\ncast during the November 2, 2004 election.             It appears from the\n\nlanguage in the order implementing the injunction that the District\n\nCourt issued the injunction merely to preserve its jurisdiction,\n\nand therefore we will treat it as such.27\n\n\n27\n   Although we are skeptical that the only purpose or effect of the\ninjunction was to preserve jurisdiction, especially considering the\nfact that this \"jurisdiction-preserving\" injunction is still in\n\n                                 -24-\n\fB.   Temporary Injunctions to Preserve Jurisdiction\n\n          Congress has provided \"[t]he Supreme Court and all courts\n\nestablished by Act of Congress [with the authority to] issue all\n\nwrits   necessary   or   appropriate     in   aid   of   their   respective\n\njurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1651(a).     Acting pursuant to § 1651(a), a federal court\n\nmay issue an injunction as a means to preserve its jurisdiction.\n\nSee, e.g., Klay v. United Healthgroup, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76607\"><a href=\"/opinion/76607/leonard-j-klay-v-humana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1099\n\n(11th Cir. 2004).   But, for a court to invoke § 1651(a) and issue\n\nan injunction to protect its jurisdiction over an action, there\n\nmust be at least the possibility that the complaint states a\n\njusticiable federal claim.      Thus, implicit in our review of the\n\nissuance of the injunction is our review of whether the Rosselló\n\ncomplaint, taking all claims alleged therein as proven, had the\n\npotential to present a justiciable federal claim under existing\n\nCircuit precedent. Mercury Motor Express, Inc. v. Brinke, 475 F.2d\n\n\nplace after approximately three weeks worth of \"marathon hearings\"\non the merits, we find that our skepticism is irrelevant in light\nof the manner in which we resolve the case. Furthermore, although\nwe believe that we properly review the non-adjudication order as an\nappealable interlocutory injunction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n1292(a)(1), we note that even if we were incorrect in this\nconclusion, we would, in the alternative, exercise our discretion\nto treat the Acevedo Defendants' notice of appeal as a petition for\nmandamus under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), thus\npreserving our jurisdiction in any event.

Federal Jurisdiction Over § 1983 Complaints\n\n           Having   determined   that    we   must   inquire   whether   the\n\nDistrict Court should have intervened in this local election\n\ndispute based on the claims alleged in the complaint, our first\n\nstep necessarily begins at the broadest level –- that is, whether\n\nthe District Court had federal subject matter jurisdiction over the\n\naction.   See Bonas, 265 F.3d at 73.      \"Federal courts are courts of\n\nlimited jurisdiction, and therefore must be certain that they have\n\nexplicit authority to decide a case.\" Id. (citing Irving v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759695\"><a href=\"/opinion/759695/gail-merchant-irving-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 160 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc)).            \"Thus, we\n\nsubject the plaintiffs' choice of a federal forum to careful\n\nscrutiny.\"   Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -26-\n\f             In Griffin, we set forth the analytical framework to\n\nevaluate whether a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over\n\na local electoral dispute.          See 570 F.2d at 1070; see also Bonas,\n\n265 F.3d at 73.           As this case is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983, we turn to the language of the jurisdictional counterpart\n\nof that statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3), which mirrors § 1983, and\n\nprovides that \"district courts shall have original jurisdiction of\n\nany civil action . . . [t]o redress the deprivation, under color of\n\nState law, statute, . . . custom or usage, of any right, privilege\n\nor immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by\n\nany Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . .\"\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1343(3).          Thus, federal jurisdiction hinges on whether\n\nplaintiffs have a colorable claim under § 1983.28                See Griffin, 570\n\nF.2d at 1070; see also Bonas, 265 F.3d at 73-74 (\"In other words,\n\nfederal courts have jurisdiction over claims arising out of a state\n\nor   local   electoral       dispute   if,   and    to   the   extent   that,   the\n\ncomplaint limns a set of facts that bespeaks the violation of a\n\nconstitutionally guaranteed right.\").\n\n             There is no doubt that the Rosselló complaint alleges the\n\nviolation        of   a   constitutionally     guaranteed      right,   and   thus,\n\npresents     a    colorable    claim   under    §   1983   for   subject-matter-\n\n\n28\n   The standard for determining the existence of original federal\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343 is, of course, much more\nliberal than the standard for determining the existence of removal\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, at least outside of the\ncomplete preemption context. See BIW Deceived, 824 F.2d at 832.\n\n                                       -27-\n\fjurisdiction purposes. The Federal Constitution protects the right\n\nof all qualified citizens to vote in local elections.                See Bonas,\n\n265 F.3d at 74.         This conclusion, however, does not end our\n\ninquiry.   Having determined that the District Court could have\n\nexercised jurisdiction in this case, we must now inquire whether it\n\nshould have intervened.         See Griffin, 570 F.2d at 170.\n\n           As mentioned above, and discussed more extensively below,\n\n\"[e]lection law, as it pertains to state and local elections, is\n\nfor the most part a preserve that lies within the exclusive\n\ncompetence of the [local] courts.\"           Bonas, 265 F.3d at 74.     We have\n\nthus   stated   that    \"with    only   a    few   narrow   and    well-defined\n\nexceptions, federal courts are not authorized to meddle in local\n\nelections.\"     Id.    This general rule of non-intervention dictates\n\nthat the District Court should not have intervened in this case.\n\nD.   District Court's Decision to Intervene\n\n           As   discussed   above,      we   review   the   decision    of   the\n\nDistrict Court to intervene in this local election dispute for\n\nabuse of discretion.        Klay, 376 F.3d at 1096.               In evaluating\n\nwhether federal intervention into a local election dispute is\n\nappropriate, this Court has inquired into factors such as whether\n\na discrete group of voters has been disenfranchised, whether there\n\nwas a state process in place to handle the question posed by the\n\nplaintiffs, and whether the plaintiffs had availed themselves of\n\nthat state process.      See Griffin, 570 F.2d at 1078-79; Bonas, 265\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fF.3d at 75-76; see also Partido Nuevo Progresista v.

As we stated in Bonas, however,\n\n\"[w]e do not pretend that it is a simple matter to segregate the\n\nrun-of-the-mill electoral disputes from those that appropriately\n\ncan be characterized as harbingers of patent and fundamental\n\nfairness.\"    265 F.3d at 75.         Indeed, \"each case must be evaluated\n\non its own facts.\"        Id.       But, as this Court implied in Barreto\n\nPérez, there is a heavy presumption in favor of non-intervention if\n\nthe party requesting intervention cannot show that a discrete group\n\nof voters has been disenfranchised by the challenged local action.\n\nSee 639 F.2d at 828.\n\n            Here,   the     final    decision    under     Puerto   Rico   law   to\n\nadjudicate all three-mark ballots under one consistent standard\n\ndoes not disenfranchise any Puerto Rico voters -– indeed, it is the\n\nposition    espoused   by     the    Rosselló    Plaintiffs    that   stands     to\n\ndisenfranchise an estimated 28,000 voters.                   Thus, because the\n\nRosselló Plaintiffs cannot claim that federal intervention is\n\nnecessary    because      a     discrete      group   of     voters   has    been\n\ndisenfranchised, and because they cannot allege any other harm\n\nsufficient to overcome the general rule of non-intervention,29 we\n\n\n29\n   We do not foreclose the possibility of a case in which federal\nintervention   would   be   appropriate   without  a   showing   of\ndisenfranchisement. The most obvious example of this would be a\ncase involving vote dilution. See Bush v. Gore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105\n(2000) (per curiam) (\"It must be remembered that 'the right of\nsuffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of\na citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the\n\n                                       -29-\n\fconclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court\n\nto intervene in this local election dispute.\n\n          In Griffin v.

That claim, however is rendered moot by the\nfact that all ballots will be adjudicated in the same uniform\nmanner during the recount. See Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. at 106 (per\ncuriam) (addressing situation where \"the standards for accepting or\nrejecting contested ballots might vary not only from county to\ncounty but indeed within a single county from one recount team to\nanother.\").\n\n                                  -30-\n\f              In     Bonas,      this     Court        held     that        complete\n\ndisenfranchisement of all voters, by a municipality's decision not\n\nto   hold     a     municipal    election      at    all,     warranted      federal\n\nintervention.        See 265 F.3d at 75-76.           In that case, after the\n\nvoters   of       North   Smithfield,    Rhode      Island    agreed   in    a   1998\n\nreferendum to transition the Town from an odd-year election cycle\n\nto an even-year cycle, with the first even-year election to take\n\nplace in 2002, town officials, without authorization, held the 1999\n\nelection, but held no election in either 2000 or 2001, effectively\n\ndisenfranchising all persons eligible to vote in the 2001 municipal\n\nelection.      Id. at 71-72.\n\n              In Barreto Pérez, however, this Court determined that\n\nfederal intervention was inappropriate in a case challenging the\n\ndecision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico where \"[the] case\n\n[did] not involve a state court order that dis enfranchise[d]\n\nvoters; rather it involve[d] a Commonwealth decision that en\n\nfranchise[d] them.\"           639 F.2d at 828.        That case is remarkably\n\nsimilar to the case at hand.            In that case, the disputed ballots\n\ncontained marks outside the designated spaces and squares, and\n\ntherefore were allegedly invalid under the literal terms of Article\n\n1.033(b) of the Electoral Law of Puerto Rico, which provided that\n\nstray marks such as the ones on the disputed ballots \"shall be null\n\nand void, and deemed unmarked.\"          See id. at 826.       The Administrator\n\nof the Election Commission ruled the ballots invalid, and his\n\n\n                                        -31-\n\fdecision was upheld on appeal by the Electoral Review Board.              See\n\nid.    The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico reversed, finding that\n\ndespite 16 L.P.R.A. § 3033(b)'s literal prohibition of counting\n\nsuch   mismarked   ballots,   the    provision   could   be   construed    as\n\npermitting the tallying of such ballots where the \"intent of the\n\nvoter was clear.\"     See id. (discussing Puerto Rico Supreme Court\n\ndecision).     The PNP subsequently brought suit in federal court\n\npursuant to § 1983,      alleging that the Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico's \"retroactive\" changing of the law after an election violated\n\nthe plaintiffs' rights not to be deprived of their liberty and\n\nFirst Amendment rights without procedural and substantive due\n\nprocess of law.     Id. at 827.      The district court agreed, stating\n\nthat \"[i]n our opinion the lesson to be learned from Griffin is[]\n\nthat changing the rules of the game after it has been played and\n\nthe score is known, violates fundamental rules of fair play.\"\n\nPartido Nuevo Progresista v.

It found that the \"counting of ballots\n\nafter an election which, under the rules prevalent at the time of\n\nthe vote-casting were considered void and invalid, [was] the\n\npractical and functional equivalent of alteration of ballots or of\n\nstuffing the ballot box.\"      Id.     On appeal, this court disagreed.\n\nSee Barreto Pérez, 639 F.2d at 828.\n\n             We emphasized that unlike in Griffin, where the disputed\n\nlocal action involved the disenfranchisement of a discrete group of\n\n\n                                     -32-\n\fvoters,    the    local    action   at   issue   in   Barreto   Pérez   actually\n\nenfranchised voters.         See id.     Instead of disenfranchisement, the\n\nplaintiffs in Barreto Pérez claimed that \"votes were 'diluted' by\n\nthe votes of others, not that they themselves were prevented from\n\nvoting.\"    Id.    Moreover, the case was also unlike Griffin in that\n\n\"had   those     casting    absentee     ballots   known   of   their   possible\n\ninvalidity, many might have gone to the polls and voted in person.\"\n\nId. In Barreto Pérez, however, \"there was no such reliance upon an\n\nofficial interpretation of the local election law; no party or\n\nperson is likely to have acted to their detriment by relying upon\n\nthe invalidity of ballots with marks outside the ballots' drawn\n\nrectangles.\"      Id.     The court concluded that the case did not fall\n\n\"within the purview of Griffin but within the area delineated by\n\nthe Second Circuit, in Powell v. Power, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"293987\"><a href=\"/opinion/293987/adam-clayton-powell-esther-mccall-john-w-duncan-robbie-clark-martha-p/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970), as\n\ninappropriate for federal court review in a civil rights action,\n\nlest the federal court 'be thrust into the details of virtually\n\nevery election.'        Id. at 86.\"      Id.\n\n            The case presented by the Rosselló Plaintiffs, even\n\nassuming that all claims alleged in their complaint could be\n\nproven, presents even less cause for federal intervention than the\n\ncircumstances which we found lacking in Barrreto Pérez.                     Here,\n\nthere is no clearly articulated Commonwealth policy, much less a\n\nstatute,    to    indicate    the   three-mark     split   vote   ballots    were\n\ninvalid.    At most, the decision of the Commission merely clarified\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fpreviously     unsettled      law.         Furthermore,      this     case    is\n\ndistinguishable from Griffin and Bonas, because \"this case does not\n\ninvolve a state court order that dis enfranchise[d] voters; rather\n\nit involves a Commonwealth decision that en franchises them.\"\n\nBarreto Pérez, 639 F.2d at 828.             Therefore, it was an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for the District Court to determine that the Rosselló\n\nPlaintiffs' complaint could possibly state a claim with grounds for\n\nfederal intervention, and as a result, it was necessarily an abuse\n\nof   discretion   for   the   District     Court   to   grant   a   preliminary\n\ninjunction preserving jurisdiction in a case in which our Circuit\n\nprecedent clearly required the District Court not to intervene.\n\n                              IV.    CONCLUSION\n\n            For the above reasons:\n\n            The Petitions for Writ of Mandamus are DENIED, as the\n\nDistrict Court has no choice but to remand the Suárez action to the\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico in light our disposition of the\n\nRosselló appeal.\n\n             We VACATE the issuance of the preliminary injunction\n\nwith the direction that the District Court dismiss with prejudice\n\nall claims in the Rosselló complaint relating to the adjudication\n\nof   the   three-mark   ballots,     and    all    claims   relating    to   the\n\nsimultaneous general canvass/recount issue.             The District Court is\n\nalso directed to dismiss without prejudice the claims relating to\n\n\n\n\n                                     -34-\n\fthe absentee ballots, and any alleged violations of Puerto Rico Law\n\n197.\n\n            Because   the   supplemental     materials    proffered   by   the\n\nappellants   are   unnecessary    to   our    decision,    the   motions    to\n\nsupplement the record on appeal are DENIED AS MOOT.              We likewise\n\nDENY the appellees' request for judicial notice.\n\n            Leave to file an amicus brief is GRANTED to the Puerto\n\nRico Association of Mayors, the Puerto Rico Commonwealth Employee\n\nAssociation and the Board of Directors of Cumbre Social, the\n\nColegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (oversized brief), Efraím\n\nCintrón García, and Gerardo Ramírez.

Gore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118395\"><a href=\"/opinion/118395/bush-v-gore/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), inapplicable.     The present circumstances do not support\n\na justiciable federal vote-dilution claim by voters who cast\n\nballots that were clearly valid under rules changed after the\n\nelection.      See   Bush,   531   U.S.   at   106-107   (criticizing   as\n\ninconsistent with equal protection Miami-Dade County's alteration,\n\nduring recount, between 1990 rules for ballot validity and new, ad\n\nhoc rules).    What happened here was not a change in Puerto Rico's\n\nestablished rules with regard to three-mark split vote ballots, but\n\nrather a clarification of the status of the ballots, whose validity\n\nor invalidity had not before been clearly established as a matter\n\nof Puerto Rico election policy.\n\n            More important in my opinion, the preeminent truth to be\n\ngleaned from the Bush opinion is that the United States is, first\n\nand foremost, a nation of laws and that the meaning of these laws\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fis interpreted by the courts, whose rulings become the Law of the\n\nLand.    Thus, notwithstanding the unprecedented nature of the Bush\n\nv. Gore decision, issued in the face of a very divided nation, its\n\nbinding    finality       was    accepted      by   the   citizenry     as    a    whole,\n\nirrespective of individual or collective disagreement with its\n\noutcome.     Although undoubtedly there was much dissonance, as there\n\nmay   well     presently    be    in     Puerto     Rico,   the    nation     turned    a\n\nfigurative page and acquiesced.                     This response reflected our\n\nnation's longstanding recognition that:\n\n               [c]ompliance    with    decisions    of   [the\n               judiciary],   as   the   constitutional  organ\n               [interpreting] the supreme Law of the Land,\n               has often, throughout our history, depended on\n               active support by state and local authorities.\n               It presupposes such support.\n\nCooper    v.

The district court did not categorize the order\n\npreventing the Commission from adjudicating the ballots.                    See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 65(d); Ben David v.

As    I    see    it,    the   order     might   plausibly   be\n\ncharacterized      as    an    All   Writs   Act     Injunction,     a   traditional\n\ninjunction under Fed. R. Civ.

Even if the\n\norder    is    properly       characterized     as    only    a   case    management\n\ndirective, we are entitled to review it under our mandamus power.\n\nSee Ramírez v.

In\n\nmy view, we should do so, given the jurisdictional issue at the\n\nheart of this case, the coercive and intrusive nature of the order,\n\nthe federalism and comity concerns that it raises, and the highly\n\ncharged circumstances in which it was issued.                     And because the\n\nquestion of the order's propriety cannot be decided without an\n\nanalysis of whether the Rosselló action is justiciable, I concur in\n\n\n                                        -39-\n\fthe decision to proceed directly to the merits and to order the\n\naction dismissed.\n\n             2. Notwithstanding our statement that the district court\n\nhas federal question jurisdiction over the case, we have concluded\n\nthat   the   district   court   abused    its   discretion   by   asserting\n\njurisdiction over it.      I would rather we characterize the matter\n\nsomewhat differently.      There is no question, of course, that the\n\ndistrict court has subject matter jurisdiction of a federal civil\n\nrights claim pleaded under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.         The issue is whether\n\nthe pleaded federal claim is justiciable.         This question is not a\n\nmatter of discretion; it is an issue of law.         See Bonas v. Town of\n\nN.

And it is an\n\nissue of law that implicates the court's \"jurisdiction\" only in the\n\nsense that justiciability is regarded as a jurisdictional doctrine.\n\nSee id.\n\n             3.   Finally, citing Partido Nuevo Progresista v.

I do, however, think that the vote-\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fdilution claims pleaded in this case were properly rejected because\n\nI agree with Judge Torruella that, on the pleadings and the record,\n\nonly one conclusion is possible:   the Commission's ruling involved\n\nonly the clarification of previously unsettled law.
