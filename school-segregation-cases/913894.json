Campbell, Lawrence S.\nCampbell, and Laurinda Claus. The parties were originally coequal beneficiaries of a\ntrust executed by Helen and her husband James W. Campbell (father). After father died\nand Helen was mentally and physically impaired, and while Dennis was a cotrustee,\ndefendants impinged on Helen to amend her trust to give ownership of her home to\ndefendants, to execute a promissory note for $65,000 secured by a trust deed on the home\nin favor of Dennis, and to execute a 10-year lease with defendants allowing them to live\nin the house rent free until Helen‟s death. Plaintiffs petitioned to invalidate all these\ndocuments (the 2010 documents) and to remove Dennis as a cotrustee. The court\ngranted the petition and also found defendants should be treated as if they had\npredeceased Helen.\n              Defendants appeal, arguing the judgment should be reversed because the\nstatement of decision is legally insufficient and the judgment is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence. We disagree and affirm.\n\n\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n1. The Original Trust\n              In 1993 father and Helen, parents of the parties, had their family attorney,\nTimothy Blied, draw up the inter vivos Campbell Family Trust. In 2001 Blied was\nretained to amend and restate the trust. In 2007 Blied again was retained to amend the\ntrust to change the trustees from father and Helen to Helen, Dennis, and James. All\ntrustees had the power to act independently. From creation of the trust until 2010 all\nparties were to share equally in the trust assets upon death of both settlors.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f2. The Parties’ Interactions with Father and Helen\n              Doreen lived with her parents in their home (residence) beginning in 1989.\nShe paid rent until 2007. Dennis moved in with his parents in 2001; he paid no rent.\nJames and Laurinda regularly visited Helen. There was no evidence of any falling out\nbetween Helen and plaintiffs. Laurinda held Helen‟s healthcare power of attorney until\nHelen‟s death. Dennis testified Helen was not capable of taking care of her finances and\nDoreen testified Helen had never done so.\n              Beginning in 2007, without telling James, Dennis comingled his own\npersonal funds with money in a bank account in the name of his parents. These included\napproximately $19,000 he and a third party won at the racetrack. Father paid the income\ntax on the winnings. Dennis paid the third party money from this account.\n              Before father died in 2008 Dennis obtained a line of credit secured by a\ndeed of trust against the residence. Laurinda testified that before father died he and\nHelen told her they were unhappy Doreen did not pay rent. After father died Helen never\ntold her she intended to amend the trust, give Dennis a $65,000 note secured by a trust\ndeed, or grant defendants a 10-year lease.\n\n\n3. Helen’s Health\n              In 2007 Helen was placed on hospice and, though expected to live only\nanother six months, did not die until May 2010.\n              From February 2009 up to the date Helen signed the 2010 documents when\nshe was 90 years old, her physical and mental condition declined severely. In September\n2009 she had “[c]ognitive decline with impaired short memory and decreased attention\nspan,” did not eat well, and could not feed herself or perform any daily activities without\nassistance. It was difficult for her to answer questions. In October she was diagnosed\nwith “significant cognitive decline.” By December she slept up to 20 hours a day.\n\n                                             3\n\f              After 2009 Helen could not read and only shadows were visible on the\ntelevision. By 2010 she could barely see due to macular degeneration. At that time she\nhad a pacemaker and suffered from emphysema, using oxygen continuously. She could\nnot walk and had to use a wheelchair. The day after she signed the 2010 documents her\nhospice physician reported “[c]ontinued cognitive decline.”\n\n\n4. Hiring the Lawyer\n              According to defendants, in 2009 Helen decided she wanted to amend her\ntrust and asked them to find a lawyer for her. Without telling cotrustee James, Dennis\nmade an appointment for her with attorney Lee Goldberg; Dennis had met him at a bar\nand grill where Dennis worked. Goldberg1 testified he sees Dennis only at the restaurant,\nabout twice a month. He is a real estate attorney and has drafted only about 36 estate\ndocuments in his 25 years of practice. Doreen also testified she had set up the meeting\nwith Goldberg.\n              Goldberg did not prepare a retainer agreement, kept no timesheets, and did\nnot bill for his services nor for any costs associated with his services, although he did tell\nHelen and Dennis the fee would be $750. Dennis testified he thought Goldberg\nperformed the services because he was his friend.\n\n\n5. The Note and Trust Deed\n              Dennis testified that over 20 years during father‟s life, father borrowed\n$65,000 from him. After father died he found Post-it notes with amounts written on them\nbut they did not add up to $65,000. Father never gave Dennis any receipts or signed\ndocuments evidencing any loan. Dennis testified he gave the Post-it notes to Goldberg\nbefore the latter prepared the promissory note, and he also testified he gave them to him\n\n       1\n       The parties stipulated that in lieu of live testimony, the judge could read all of\nGoldberg‟s deposition testimony.\n\n                                              4\n\fafterward. Dennis said he spoke to Goldberg about the loan but also testified he did not\neven know about the promissory note. Dennis testified Goldberg instructed him to throw\naway some of the evidence supporting the amount of the loan.\n               Goldberg testified the only evidence he saw supporting a loan were some\nhandwritten notations, which did not equal $65,000. Moreover, Helen was unable to\npoint to any evidence of owing that amount. Goldberg testified the slips of paper Dennis\nsupplied did not total $65,000 but Helen “was adamant” that she owed him that sum.\nGoldberg prepared a promissory note for that amount in favor of Dennis and a deed of\ntrust on the residence securing the note.\n\n\n6. The Lease\n               Goldberg also prepared a 10-year lease in favor of defendants, which\nrequired no payment of rent until Helen‟s death. The term of the lease began in February\n2010. Doreen testified the lease was a “complete surprise.”\n\n\n7. The Amendment to the Trust\n               The final document Goldberg prepared was an amendment to the trust,\nwhich gave the residence to defendants, eliminating plaintiffs‟ portion of the gift.\n\n\n8. Execution of the 2010 Documents\n               Helen signed the 2010 documents on February 8, 2010. Doreen testified\nshe had to help Helen sign the documents because Helen could not see. The only way\nHelen knew where to sign was the location of Doreen‟s finger. Doreen also said\nGoldberg read all the February 2010 documents to Helen. Goldberg testified he did as\nwell. At that time Helen could not hear and did not wear her hearing aids. Doreen “did\nnot pay attention to what [Goldberg] was reading.” Goldberg testified Helen did not have\nanyone assist her in signing the documents and Doreen was not present.\n\n                                             5\n\f              Defendants never told James, as cotrustee, or the other plaintiffs about any\nof Goldberg‟s visits or that Helen signed the 2010 documents; Goldberg did not provide\nthem with copies of those documents. Dennis informed Goldberg he was a cotrustee but\nprobably did not tell him James was as well.\n              After Helen died, defendants obtained James‟s consent to use about\n$48,000 in a bank account to pay down the line of credit. Under the residual clause of the\ntrust, the money would have been divided equally among the parties.\n\n\n9. The Petition, Trial, Statement of Decision and Judgment\n              Plaintiffs filed a petition for financial elder abuse (Elder Abuse and\nDependent Adult Civil Protection Act; Welf. & Inst. Code, §15600 et seq.) (Elder Abuse\nAct), undue influence, and breach of trust, seeking rescission of the 2010 documents and\nreturn of the property. Defendants‟ cross-petition for a declaration plaintiffs breached the\nno-contest clause is not part of this appeal.\n              After trial the court found in favor of plaintiffs and ordered them to prepare\na statement of decision. The proposed statement of decision addressed the 11 joint\ndisputed factual issues set out in the joint pretrial statement. Defendants‟ request for the\nstatement of decision included 47 questions for which they sought a ruling, many of\nwhich were included in the original statement of decision.\n              In response to an objection to the statement of decision, the court ordered\nplaintiffs to revise the statement of decision to include findings as to Doreen, the burden\nof proof for each cause of action, and a statement that credible evidence supported each\nof them, which plaintiffs did. After an objection to the revised statement, the court\nordered one additional change, i.e., that Doreen‟s testimony she did not know the nature\nof the documents being discussed at the meetings between Goldberg and Helen was not\ncredible. All other objections were overruled. That change was made and judgment was\nentered.\n\n                                                6\n\f               The judgment stated defendants had committed financial elder abuse\nagainst Helen and the 2010 documents were a product of undue influence. All the 2010\ndocuments were cancelled, Dennis was removed as a cotrustee, and defendants were\ndeemed to have predeceased Helen under Probate Code section 259;2 the court ruled that,\npursuant to that section, plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney fees. The\nstatement of decision also ruled plaintiffs had not violated the no contest clause.\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n\n1. Introduction and Basic Legal Principles\n               Before we get to the substance of the appeal, we must address the parties‟\nviolations of the court rules governing appeals. California Rules of Court, rule\n8.204(a)(1)(C) requires “any reference to a matter in the record” to be supported by a\ncitation to its location. These citations must be included in both the summary of facts and\nthe argument portion of the brief even if duplicative. (City of Lincoln v. Barringer (2002)\n102 Cal.App.4th 1211, 1239, fn. 16.)\n       Although both parties included some record references, neither party fully cited to\nthe record, improperly requiring the court to do counsel‟s work. (Schmidlin v. City of\nPalo Alto (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 728, 738 [“„It is neither practical nor appropriate for us\nto comb the record on [a party‟s] behalf‟”].) In defendants‟ case, failure to comply with\nthis rule could have lead to a forfeiture of their arguments. (Evans v. CenterStone\nDevelopment Co. (2005) 134 Cal.App.4th 151, 166-167.) We have reluctantly\noverlooked this deficiency to decide the case on the merits.\n               Turning to the substance of the appeal, a statement of decision must\n“explain[] the factual and legal basis for [the court‟s] decision as to each of the principal\n\n\n       2   All further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated.\n\n                                               7\n\fcontroverted issues at trial . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 632.) But it need not make findings\non subsidiary issues even if they are material to the ultimate issues. (Kuffel v. Seaside Oil\nCo. (1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 555, 565-566.)\n              Defendants devote a substantial portion of their briefs arguing the statement\nof decision was insufficient because it either relied on incorrect legal standards or failed\nto state a legal standard. They also contend it failed to set out required factual findings\nfor the various causes of action. The material issues here are those set out in the\nstipulated facts. Even if we look at each cause of action separately, the trial court\nexplained the required legal standards and factual findings to support the statement of\ndecision. Defendants‟ arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.\n\n\n2. Undue Influence\n              a. Trust Amendment\n              Defendants argue the statement of decision failed to set out the legal\nstandard       for undue influence concerning the trust amendment. They claim the court\nincorrectly relied on Civil Code section 1575, which applies to irrevocable inter vivos\ntransfers such as contracts and not to testamentary transfers such as the trust amendment.\n              Undue influence in a testamentary context “is pressure brought to bear\ndirectly on the testamentary act, sufficient to overcome the testator‟s free will, amounting\nin effect to coercion destroying the testator‟s free agency.” (Rice v. Clark (2002) 28\nCal.4th 89, 96.) It is “extraordinary and abnormal pressure [that] subverts independent\nfree will and diverts it from its natural course in accordance with the dictates of another\nperson.” (Estate of Sarabia (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 599, 605, superseded by statute on\nother grounds as stated in Rice v. Clark, supra, 28 Cal.4th 89.) “„“[T]he circumstances\nmust be inconsistent with voluntary action on the part of the testator” [citation]; and\n“[the] mere opportunity to influence the mind of the testator, even coupled with an\ninterest or a motive to do so, is not sufficient.”‟ [Citation.]” (Estate of Sarabia, supra,\n\n                                              8\n\f221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 604-605.) Defendants assert this standard was omitted from the\nstatement of decision as it made a finding Helen‟s execution of the trust amendment was\nnot based on her free will or true intent.\n              But this argument is irrelevant because the statement of decision relied on\nthe presumption of undue influence, which supplants the usual burden of proof resting on\nthe party attacking a testamentary document. (§ 8252, subd. (a).) The presumption shifts\nthe burden of proof if the challenger shows “(1) the person alleged to have exerted undue\ninfluence had a confidential relationship with the testator; (2) the person actively\nparticipated in procuring the instrument‟s preparation or execution; and (3) the person\nwould benefit unduly by the testamentary instrument.” (Rice v. Clark, supra, 28 Cal.4th\nat pp. 96-97.) The trier of fact decides whether the presumption will be applied and if it\nhas been rebutted. (Conservatorship of Davidson (2003) 113 Cal.App.4th 1035, 1060\ndisapproved on another ground in Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 816, fn. 14.)\n              The statement of decision set out the standard and the factual basis for the\nfinding. First, Dennis, as cotrustee, had a confidential relationship with Helen. Helen\n“relied greatly” on both Doreen and Dennis, her children, as caregivers, and, although not\nmentioned, both lived with Helen for several years. We reject defendants‟ conclusory\nclaim there is no evidence they pressured Helen.\n              The second factor, procurement of execution of the amendment, which may\nbe shown by circumstantial evidence (Estate of Baker (1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 471, 481),\nincludes the alleged wrongdoers‟ “„“control over the decedent‟s business affairs,\ndependency of the decedent upon the beneficiary for care and attention, or domination on\nthe part of the beneficiary and subserviency on the part of the deceased”‟” (ibid.). Here,\nas set out in the statement of decision, defendants were extensively involved in procuring\nthe amendment, hiring Goldberg, instead of Helen‟s usual estate planning lawyer, and\nscheduling meetings with him. Helen could not hear or see and Doreen had to point to\nwhere she should sign documents. Dennis was heavily involved in Helen‟s financial\n\n                                              9\n\faffairs. This evidence controverts defendants‟ claim they did nothing more than help\nHelen find a lawyer and, in accordance with her wishes, attend certain meetings. (Cf.\nEstate of Mann (1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 593, 607 [beneficiaries‟ selection of lawyer to\nprepare trust or presence at signing alone not sufficient to support undue influence].)\n              Contrary to defendants‟ rather conclusory claim, there are also facts\nshowing they received undue profit, the third factor. Before the amendment, the five\nchildren were to share in the house equally. Afterwards, the three plaintiffs were to\nreceive no share. The house was the primary asset of the estate so the effect of the\namendment was to virtually disinherit plaintiffs.\n              Defendants argue undue profit is determined “based on a qualitative\nassessment of the evidence, not a quantitative one.” (Conservatorship of Davidson,\nsupra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) In other words, “„undue‟” depends on “„what profit\nwould be “due.”‟” (Ibid.) There was evidence Helen would not want to amend the trust\nto cut plaintiffs out of her estate. James was a cotrustee and assisted Helen with some of\nher finances. He and Laurinda lived near Helen and visited her regularly. Laurinda was\nHelen‟s attorney in fact in her health care power of attorney. Thus, under this standard\nand based on these facts, the trust amendment gave defendants an undue profit.\n              Defendants assert there was “uncontroverted evidence” of both Helen‟s true\nintent and the lack of undue profit that the court failed to consider. They set out nine\npages of evidence they claim warrants reversal. This includes testimony from caregivers\nother than defendants that Helen told them she wanted the house to go to defendants, and\nGoldberg‟s testimony he gave Helen several options as to how to divide her estate. They\nalso refer to their own testimony about outings with and care of Helen and a friend‟s\ntestimony Helen was unhappy plaintiffs did not visit more often.\n              This argument fails. The court did not have to believe any of this\ntestimony. It is reasonable to infer the court found the evidence suspect given\ndefendants‟ relationship with Helen. In addition, there was contrary evidence supporting\n\n                                             10\n\fthe presumption. Even the testimony of one witness can constitute substantial evidence,\ndespite conflicting testimony from several witnesses. (Evid. Code, § 411; City and\nCounty of San Francisco v. Givens (2000) 85 Cal.App.4th 51, 56.) The trier of fact\nevaluates evidence and rules on the credibility of witnesses. It is not our function to\nreweigh those decisions. (White v. Inbound Aviation (1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 910, 927.)\nLikewise, when the evidence supports two or more reasonable inferences, we may not\nsubstitute our conclusion for that of the trial court. (Ortega v. Pajara Valley Unified\nSchool Dist. (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1043.)\n              We reject defendants‟ argument the court erroneously relied on Civil Code\nsection 1575 as the standard for undue influence as to the trust amendment. The court\nrelied on the presumption of undue influence. As set out below, Civil Code section 1575\nwas the the basis for the finding of undue influence as to the promissory note, trust deed,\nand lease (other documents).\n\n\n              b. Other Documents\n              Civil Code section 1575 states undue influence occurs when a party\n“tak[es] an unfair advantage of another‟s weakness of mind; or, [¶] . . . tak[es] a grossly\noppressive and unfair advantage of another‟s necessities or distress.” (Civ. Code, § 1575,\nsubds. 2, 3.) The court found the other documents were all the product of undue\ninfluence by defendants and should be set aside.\n              Defendants claim there is insufficient evidence to support the finding.\nThey assert seven factors (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist. (1966) 246 Cal.App.2d\n123) are required to prove undue influence and maintain the statement of decision makes\nfindings as to none of them. These include things such as a demand a transaction be\nconcluded immediately, discussions of the transaction at an odd time, the lack of a third-\nparty adviser, and the inability to consult such an adviser. (Id. at p. 133.) But the very\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fpremise of this argument is incorrect. Odorizzi does not presume to set out an exclusive\nlist of facts necessary to show undue influence. (Id. at p. 133.)\n              “What constitutes undue influence and what constitutes sufficient proof\nthereof depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. It „is a species\nof constructive fraud which the courts will not undertake to define by any fixed\nprinciples, lest the very definition itself furnish a finger-board pointing out the path by\nwhich it may be evaded.‟ [Citation.]” (Sparks v. Sparks (1950) 101 Cal.App.2d 129,\n135.) Undue influence “involves the use of excessive pressure to persuade one\nvulnerable to such pressure . . . .” (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist., supra, 246\nCal.App.2d at p. 131.) It “may consist of total weakness of mind which leaves a person\nentirely without understanding [citation]; or, a lesser weakness which destroys the\ncapacity of a person to make a contract even though he is not totally incapacitated . . . .”\n(Ibid.) It “need not be longlasting nor wholly incapacitating, but may be merely a lack of\nfull vigor due to age [citation], physical condition [citation] . . ., or a combination of such\nfactors. The reported cases have usually involved elderly, sick, senile persons alleged to\nhave executed wills or deeds under pressure. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n              A review of the evidence set out in detail above and the findings in the\nstatement of decision demonstrates there is substantial evidence to show undue influence.\nHelen was 90 years old and had “mental deficits,” including severe cognitive decline.\nShe slept 20 hours a day. Defendants lived with her and acted as her caregivers part of\nthe time. They secured her attorney, and Doreen had to point to where Helen should sign\nthe other documents because she could not see or hear. The court ruled Doreen‟s\ntestimony she did not know the contents of the other documents was not credible. Based\non this evidence the court reasonably found defendants exerted undue influence on\nHelen.\n              In the second argument, defendants claim the finding they did not rebut the\npresumption of undue influence under Civil Code section 1575 is legally insufficient.\n\n                                              12\n\fUndue influence in this context is “[i]n the use, by one in whom a confidence is reposed\nby another, or who holds a real or apparent authority over him, of such confidence or\nauthority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage over him [or her].” (Civ.\nCode, § 1575, subd. 1.) Section 16004, subdivision (c) states, “A transaction between the\ntrustee and a beneficiary which occurs during the existence of the trust or while the\ntrustee‟s influence with the beneficiary remains and by which the trustee obtains an\nadvantage from the beneficiary is presumed to be a violation of the trustee‟s fiduciary\nduties. This presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.”\n              “There are certain relations from the existence of which the law will infer\nspecial confidence . . . . [Citation.] A confidential relation in fact should be the test.\nWhere a grantor has trust and confidence in the integrity and fidelity of the grantee and\nthe latter takes advantage of the grantor relief will be afforded. [Citation.] One who\nholds a confidential relationship will be presumed to have taken undue advantage of his\ntrusting friend unless it shall appear that the latter had independent advice and acted not\nonly of his own volition but with full comprehension of the results of his action.\n[Citation.]” (Sparks v. Sparks, supra, 101 Cal.App.2d at pp. 135-136.)\n              The court found Dennis, as cotrustee of the trust, had a confidential\nrelationship with Helen. It also determined the note and the rent free lease gave Dennis\nan advantage. Dennis failed to meet his burden to show the other documents were not a\nresult of undue influence.\n              Defendants assert the statement of decision lacked findings showing Helen\nwas not fully informed when she agreed to execute the other documents or that these\ndocuments were unfair, claiming there was uncontroverted evidence Helen wanted to\nexecute these documents. They point to testimony of the caregivers and Goldberg that\nHelen told them Dennis was owed the money. They also maintain the note and trust deed\nwere fair because Dennis had loaned father money over the years. They likewise argue\nthe lease was fair because defendants had to pay on the line of credit and because they\n\n                                              13\n\fhad not previously paid rent. But this testimony is not unrebutted, as discussed above,\nand again, defendants are asking us to reweigh evidence, a task not within our province.\nThe statement of decision was sufficient in this regard.\n              In a related argument, defendants claim there is no substantial evidence\nHelen lacked contractual capacity. Under section 811, subdivision (b) and as shown by\nthe evidence already laid out, Helen lacked the capacity to execute the other documents\nbecause her mental deficits “significantly impair[ed her] ability to understand and\nappreciate the consequences of . . . [her] actions with regard to” them. There was a direct\ncorrelation between her deficits and execution of the other documents. Defendants‟\nclaim there was insufficient evidence is another instance of their inappropriate request we\nreweigh evidence.\n\n\n3. Elder Abuse\n              a. Trust Amendment\n              Defendants argue the statement of decision finding they engaged in\nfinancial elder abuse to procure the trust amendment did not use the correct legal\nstandard. They claim Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30, which sets out the\nelements of financial elder abuse, does not apply to the trust amendment because it did\nnot transfer any property rights to them.\n              Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30 financial elder abuse\noccurs when a person “[t]akes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal\nproperty of an elder,” among other things, for “wrongful use or or with intent to defraud,\nor both,” or “by undue influence, as defined in Section 1575 of the Civil Code.” (Welf.\n& Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1), (2).) A person “takes, secretes, appropriates,\nobtains, or retains real or personal property when an elder . . . is deprived of any property\nright, including by means of an agreement, donative transfer, or testamentary\nbequest . . . .” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (c), italics added.)\n\n                                             14\n\f              Although ownership of the residence did not vest in defendants at the time\nHelen signed the amendment, given her medical condition, defendants‟ control over her,\nand the fact she died three months after signing the trust amendment, at minimum\ndefendants “secrete[d]” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1), (3)) the residence\nfrom her. The effect of defendants‟ undue influence was to deprive Helen of her interest\nat the time she executed the trust amendment.\n\n\n              b. Other Documents\n              As to the other documents, defendants make only a passing reference in one\nof their headings that there was no substantial evidence of elder abuse “relying\nexclusively” on undue influence. (Boldface and capitalization omitted.) Failure to make\nany reasoned legal argument forfeits this claim. (Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007)\n149 Cal.App.4th 836, 852.)\n\n\n4. Section 259\n              Defendants maintain that even if they committed elder abuse, full\ndisinheritance under section 259 was erroneous. This argument has no merit.\n              Section 259 provides four conditions that must be met before disinheritance\napplies. They are that defendants committed financial abuse (requiring proof by clear\nand convincing evidence), they acted in bad faith and were “reckless, oppressive,\nfraudulent or malicious,” and Helen was “substantially unable to manage . . . her financial\nresources or to resist fraud or undue influence” at the time of the abuse and thereafter\nuntil her death. (§ 259, subd. (a).) We have already determined these conditions were\nproven and in this argument defendants do not challenge these conditions, except to state\na conclusion there was no financial elder abuse.\n              As a result of the abuse, defendants may not “receive any property,\ndamages, or costs that are awarded to [Helen‟s] estate” resulting from an action arising\n\n                                             15\n\fout of the abuse. (§ 259, subd. (c)(1).) They are also barred from serving as Helen‟s\nfiduciary since the will or trust designating them was executed while Helen was unable to\nmanage her finances or resist undue influence of fraud. (§ 259, subd. (c)(2).) In other\nwords, section 259 “does not necessarily disinherit an abuser entirely but rather restricts\nthe abuser‟s right to benefit from his or her abusive conduct. [Citations.]” (Estate of\nDito (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 791, 803, fn. omitted.) The statute “restricts the value of\nthe estate to which the abuser‟s percentage share is applied and prevents that person from\nbenefiting from his or her own wrongful conduct.” (Id. at p. 804.) The abusers are\nconsidered “to have predeceased the decedent only to the extent the person would have\nbeen entitled through a will, trust, or laws of intestacy to receive a distribution of the\ndamages and costs the person is found to be liable to pay to the estate as a result of the\nabuse.” (Id. at pp. 803-804, fn. omitted.)\n              The statement of decision provides that the 2010 documents were procured\nby defendants‟ undue influence. It also specifies that, because defendants committed\nfinancial elder abuse by taking an interest in Helen‟s real property by virtue of the lease,\nthey are deemed to have predeceased her. The judgment states defendants are considered\nto have predeceased Helen and the assets of the trust “are to be distributed accordingly.”\n              Defendants argue they should not be disinherited because they never “took\nany [of Helen‟s] property . . . into their own names.” They are not correct. They lived in\nthe residence rent free, Dennis received $65,000 under the note secured by a trust deed on\nthe residence, and they “secrete[d]” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (c)) the\nresidence from her. The 2010 documents were all cancelled and defendants were\nrequired to return all the interests they obtained via the 2010 documents.\n              Section 259 is a forfeiture statute, the purpose of which is “to deter the\nabuse of elders by prohibiting abusers from benefiting from the abuse. . . . By enacting\nthis statute, the Legislature hoped that the threat of extinguishing inheritance rights, and\nthe financial incentive to others to report abuse, would deter abuse.” (Estate of Lowrie\n\n                                              16\n\f(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 220, 229.) In giving effect to a statute we presume the\nLegislature did not intend absurd results. (Jurcoane v. Superior Court (2001) 93\nCal.App.4th 886, 893.)\n              There would be no need for the statute if defendants could engage in the\nconduct described here to pressure Helen to transfer the various interests to them and\navoid any consequences. Merely cancelling the 2010 documents and then allowing\ndefendants to share in the estate as they would have absent the abuse is no deterrence at\nall. Defendants would be in no worse position than if they had not employed the undue\ninfluence. That result would violate both the spirit and the intent of section 259.\n\n\n5. Fraud\n              Defendants complain the court failed to make a finding as to whether fraud\nwas “an independent cause of action” and challenge the statement of decision for failing\nto discuss elements or findings of fraud. This argument borders on frivolous. Review of\nthe petition shows there is no fraud cause of action, nor is the judgment for fraud.\nTherefore, there would be no need to discuss it in the statement of decision or to make\nfactual findings. The statement in the judgment the trust amendment was procured by\n“fraud/undue influence” is superfluous since the statement of decision supports a finding\nof undue influence.\n\n\n6. Testamentary Capacity\n              Defendants claim the statement of decision conflates the standard for\ntestamentary capacity with that of contractual capacity in the context of the trust\namendment. This is incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f              Section 6100.5, subdivision (a)3 provides a person is “not mentally\ncompetent to make a will if at the time of making” it the person “does not have sufficient\nmental capacity to be able to (A) understand the nature of the testamentary act, (B)\nunderstand and recollect the nature and situation of the individual‟s property, or (C)\nremember and understand the individual‟s relations to living descendants . . . and those\nwhose interests are affected by the will.” (Italics added.) Section 6100.5 applies to the\ncapacity to amend a trust by virtue of section 811. (Andersen v. Hunt (2011) 196\nCal.App.4th 722, 731.)\n              Section 811, cited in the statement of decision, lists the “mental functions”\nto be considered when a court is making a decision a person “lacks the capacity to . . . to\ncontract . . . or to execute trusts . . . .” (§ 811, subd. (a).) They include “(1) Alertness and\nattention, including, but not limited to, . . . [¶] (A) Level of arousal or\nconsciousness[ and] [¶] (B) Orientation to time, place, person, and situation.” (Ibid.) “A\ndeficit in the mental functions listed above may be considered only if the deficit, by itself\nor in combination with one or more other mental function deficits, significantly impairs\nthe person‟s ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions\nwith regard to the type of act or decision in question.” (§ 811, subd. (b).) The court also\npointed to section 810, subdivision (c), which states that a finding a person “lack[s] the\nlegal capacity to perform a specific act” must rest on “evidence of a deficit in one or\nmore of the person‟s mental functions rather than on a diagnosis of a person‟s mental or\nphysical disorder.”\n              The statement of decision met these requirements. It laid out the evidence\nshowing Helen‟s necessity and distress based on her poor health and her heavy reliance\non defendants as caregivers. It also found Helen had “weakness of mind” “evidenced by\n\n      3 Contrary to defendants‟ claim, the statement of decision did not “dismiss” the\napplicability of section 6100.5, subdivision (a).\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fdocumented mental deficits that affected her testamentary capacity,” which defendants\ntook advantage of. It further specified there was credible evidence Helen “was not\noriented to time, place, person and situation in and around February 2010.” She slept as\nmuch as 20 hours a day around the time she executed the 2010 documents. This, and the\nevidence she could not read or hear and of her severe cognitive decline at the time she\nexecuted the trust amendment, was sufficient to show Helen was mentally incompetent.\n              The absence of a finding Helen suffered from hallucinations or delusions is\ninconsequential; that is an alternate factor proving incompetence (§ 6100.5, subd. (a)(2))\nand not required. For the same reasons as stated above, we again reject defendants‟ claim\nthere is uncontroverted evidence to show plaintiffs did not prove the section 6100.5\nfactors.\n\n\n7. Breach of Trust\n              The statement of decision found Dennis breached the trust, both as to Helen\nduring her lifetime and as to the plaintiffs after Helen‟s death. Defendants rely on trust\nlanguage that Dennis should not be liable for breach of trust if he acts in good faith and\nwithout gross negligence. He argues the statement of decision fails to include findings to\nsupport these two factors and the evidence shows he was neither grossly negligent nor\nacted in bad faith. This argument is easily disposed of.\n              There is not only sufficient evidence, there is overwhelming evidence\nDennis did not act in good faith. As set out in the statement of decision, he exerted undue\ninfluence to obtain the trust amendment whereby Helen transferred all of the interest in\nthe residence to defendants, to the exclusion of plaintiffs. He procured the $65,000 note\nin his favor secured by a deed of trust on the residence, a trust asset, and there was\nsubstantial evidence there was no consideration for the note. He also procured the lease\nof the residence on behalf of himself and Doreen, providing they were not obligated to\npay rent until after Helen‟s death. He never revealed his actions or the existence of the\n\n                                             19\n\f2010 documents to James, his cotrustee, or to any of the other plaintiffs who were trust\nbeneficiaries. He fraudulently induced James to agree to use a trust bank account to\nsubstantially pay down the line of credit secured by the residence when it would have\nbeen his personal responsibility to pay that off. And this is just some of the evidence\nshowing a breach of trust.\n              Dennis‟s one contrary argument that he had no intent to breach the trust and\ndid not know the contents of the trust amendment again improperly seeks to have us\nreweigh evidence. Since he did not act in good faith we need not discuss whether he was\nnegligent since the trust required both elements to be satisfied.\n\n\n8. Attorney Fees\n              The amount of attorney fees to be awarded is within the court‟s sound\ndiscretion, taking into account the type and difficulty of the matter, counsel‟s skill vis-à-\nvis the skill required to handle the case, counsel‟s age and experience, the time and\nattention counsel gave to the case, and the outcome. (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v.\nWestway Contractors, Inc. (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 152, 168.) An experienced trial judge\nis best qualified to decide the value of an attorney‟s services in a given matter, and on\nappeal we will not reverse that decision unless it is clearly wrong. (11382 Beach\nPartnership v. Libaw (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 212, 220.) We are not persuaded the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in its apportionment of the fees. The fact the court did not\nconsider all of the transactions on which plaintiffs relied to prove elder abuse is\nirrelevant. In deciding whether to segregate attorney fees, the court does not look at\nindividual pieces of evidence but at the various causes of action.\n\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n\n\n           The judgment is affirmed. Plaintiffs are entitled to costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              THOMPSON, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nO‟LEARY, P.

Campbell, Lawrence S.\nCampbell, and Laurinda Claus. The parties were originally coequal beneficiaries of a\ntrust executed by Helen and her husband James W. Campbell (father). After father died\nand Helen was mentally and physically impaired, and while Dennis was a cotrustee,\ndefendants impinged on Helen to amend her trust to give ownership of her home to\ndefendants, to execute a promissory note for $65,000 secured by a trust deed on the home\nin favor of Dennis, and to execute a 10-year lease with defendants allowing them to live\nin the house rent free until Helen‟s death. Plaintiffs petitioned to invalidate all these\ndocuments (the 2010 documents) and to remove Dennis as a cotrustee. The court\ngranted the petition and also found defendants should be treated as if they had\npredeceased Helen.\n              Defendants appeal, arguing the judgment should be reversed because the\nstatement of decision is legally insufficient and the judgment is not supported by\nsubstantial evidence. We disagree and affirm.\n\n\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n1. The Original Trust\n              In 1993 father and Helen, parents of the parties, had their family attorney,\nTimothy Blied, draw up the inter vivos Campbell Family Trust. In 2001 Blied was\nretained to amend and restate the trust. In 2007 Blied again was retained to amend the\ntrust to change the trustees from father and Helen to Helen, Dennis, and James. All\ntrustees had the power to act independently. From creation of the trust until 2010 all\nparties were to share equally in the trust assets upon death of both settlors.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f2. The Parties’ Interactions with Father and Helen\n              Doreen lived with her parents in their home (residence) beginning in 1989.\nShe paid rent until 2007. Dennis moved in with his parents in 2001; he paid no rent.\nJames and Laurinda regularly visited Helen. There was no evidence of any falling out\nbetween Helen and plaintiffs. Laurinda held Helen‟s healthcare power of attorney until\nHelen‟s death. Dennis testified Helen was not capable of taking care of her finances and\nDoreen testified Helen had never done so.\n              Beginning in 2007, without telling James, Dennis comingled his own\npersonal funds with money in a bank account in the name of his parents. These included\napproximately $19,000 he and a third party won at the racetrack. Father paid the income\ntax on the winnings. Dennis paid the third party money from this account.\n              Before father died in 2008 Dennis obtained a line of credit secured by a\ndeed of trust against the residence. Laurinda testified that before father died he and\nHelen told her they were unhappy Doreen did not pay rent. After father died Helen never\ntold her she intended to amend the trust, give Dennis a $65,000 note secured by a trust\ndeed, or grant defendants a 10-year lease.\n\n\n3. Helen’s Health\n              In 2007 Helen was placed on hospice and, though expected to live only\nanother six months, did not die until May 2010.\n              From February 2009 up to the date Helen signed the 2010 documents when\nshe was 90 years old, her physical and mental condition declined severely. In September\n2009 she had “[c]ognitive decline with impaired short memory and decreased attention\nspan,” did not eat well, and could not feed herself or perform any daily activities without\nassistance. It was difficult for her to answer questions. In October she was diagnosed\nwith “significant cognitive decline.” By December she slept up to 20 hours a day.\n\n                                             3\n\f              After 2009 Helen could not read and only shadows were visible on the\ntelevision. By 2010 she could barely see due to macular degeneration. At that time she\nhad a pacemaker and suffered from emphysema, using oxygen continuously. She could\nnot walk and had to use a wheelchair. The day after she signed the 2010 documents her\nhospice physician reported “[c]ontinued cognitive decline.”\n\n\n4. Hiring the Lawyer\n              According to defendants, in 2009 Helen decided she wanted to amend her\ntrust and asked them to find a lawyer for her. Without telling cotrustee James, Dennis\nmade an appointment for her with attorney Lee Goldberg; Dennis had met him at a bar\nand grill where Dennis worked. Goldberg1 testified he sees Dennis only at the restaurant,\nabout twice a month. He is a real estate attorney and has drafted only about 36 estate\ndocuments in his 25 years of practice. Doreen also testified she had set up the meeting\nwith Goldberg.\n              Goldberg did not prepare a retainer agreement, kept no timesheets, and did\nnot bill for his services nor for any costs associated with his services, although he did tell\nHelen and Dennis the fee would be $750. Dennis testified he thought Goldberg\nperformed the services because he was his friend.\n\n\n5. The Note and Trust Deed\n              Dennis testified that over 20 years during father‟s life, father borrowed\n$65,000 from him. After father died he found Post-it notes with amounts written on them\nbut they did not add up to $65,000. Father never gave Dennis any receipts or signed\ndocuments evidencing any loan. Dennis testified he gave the Post-it notes to Goldberg\nbefore the latter prepared the promissory note, and he also testified he gave them to him\n\n       1\n       The parties stipulated that in lieu of live testimony, the judge could read all of\nGoldberg‟s deposition testimony.\n\n                                              4\n\fafterward. Dennis said he spoke to Goldberg about the loan but also testified he did not\neven know about the promissory note. Dennis testified Goldberg instructed him to throw\naway some of the evidence supporting the amount of the loan.\n               Goldberg testified the only evidence he saw supporting a loan were some\nhandwritten notations, which did not equal $65,000. Moreover, Helen was unable to\npoint to any evidence of owing that amount. Goldberg testified the slips of paper Dennis\nsupplied did not total $65,000 but Helen “was adamant” that she owed him that sum.\nGoldberg prepared a promissory note for that amount in favor of Dennis and a deed of\ntrust on the residence securing the note.\n\n\n6. The Lease\n               Goldberg also prepared a 10-year lease in favor of defendants, which\nrequired no payment of rent until Helen‟s death. The term of the lease began in February\n2010. Doreen testified the lease was a “complete surprise.”\n\n\n7. The Amendment to the Trust\n               The final document Goldberg prepared was an amendment to the trust,\nwhich gave the residence to defendants, eliminating plaintiffs‟ portion of the gift.\n\n\n8. Execution of the 2010 Documents\n               Helen signed the 2010 documents on February 8, 2010. Doreen testified\nshe had to help Helen sign the documents because Helen could not see. The only way\nHelen knew where to sign was the location of Doreen‟s finger. Doreen also said\nGoldberg read all the February 2010 documents to Helen. Goldberg testified he did as\nwell. At that time Helen could not hear and did not wear her hearing aids. Doreen “did\nnot pay attention to what [Goldberg] was reading.” Goldberg testified Helen did not have\nanyone assist her in signing the documents and Doreen was not present.\n\n                                             5\n\f              Defendants never told James, as cotrustee, or the other plaintiffs about any\nof Goldberg‟s visits or that Helen signed the 2010 documents; Goldberg did not provide\nthem with copies of those documents. Dennis informed Goldberg he was a cotrustee but\nprobably did not tell him James was as well.\n              After Helen died, defendants obtained James‟s consent to use about\n$48,000 in a bank account to pay down the line of credit. Under the residual clause of the\ntrust, the money would have been divided equally among the parties.\n\n\n9. The Petition, Trial, Statement of Decision and Judgment\n              Plaintiffs filed a petition for financial elder abuse (Elder Abuse and\nDependent Adult Civil Protection Act; Welf. & Inst. Code, §15600 et seq.) (Elder Abuse\nAct), undue influence, and breach of trust, seeking rescission of the 2010 documents and\nreturn of the property. Defendants‟ cross-petition for a declaration plaintiffs breached the\nno-contest clause is not part of this appeal.\n              After trial the court found in favor of plaintiffs and ordered them to prepare\na statement of decision. The proposed statement of decision addressed the 11 joint\ndisputed factual issues set out in the joint pretrial statement. Defendants‟ request for the\nstatement of decision included 47 questions for which they sought a ruling, many of\nwhich were included in the original statement of decision.\n              In response to an objection to the statement of decision, the court ordered\nplaintiffs to revise the statement of decision to include findings as to Doreen, the burden\nof proof for each cause of action, and a statement that credible evidence supported each\nof them, which plaintiffs did. After an objection to the revised statement, the court\nordered one additional change, i.e., that Doreen‟s testimony she did not know the nature\nof the documents being discussed at the meetings between Goldberg and Helen was not\ncredible. All other objections were overruled. That change was made and judgment was\nentered.\n\n                                                6\n\f               The judgment stated defendants had committed financial elder abuse\nagainst Helen and the 2010 documents were a product of undue influence. All the 2010\ndocuments were cancelled, Dennis was removed as a cotrustee, and defendants were\ndeemed to have predeceased Helen under Probate Code section 259;2 the court ruled that,\npursuant to that section, plaintiffs were entitled to reasonable attorney fees. The\nstatement of decision also ruled plaintiffs had not violated the no contest clause.\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n\n1. Introduction and Basic Legal Principles\n               Before we get to the substance of the appeal, we must address the parties‟\nviolations of the court rules governing appeals. California Rules of Court, rule\n8.204(a)(1)(C) requires “any reference to a matter in the record” to be supported by a\ncitation to its location. These citations must be included in both the summary of facts and\nthe argument portion of the brief even if duplicative. (City of Lincoln v. Barringer (2002)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246225\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246225/city-of-lincoln-v-barringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1239, fn. 16.)\n       Although both parties included some record references, neither party fully cited to\nthe record, improperly requiring the court to do counsel‟s work. (Schmidlin v. City of\nPalo Alto (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 738 [“„It is neither practical nor appropriate for us\nto comb the record on [a party‟s] behalf‟”].) In defendants‟ case, failure to comply with\nthis rule could have lead to a forfeiture of their arguments. (Evans v. CenterStone\nDevelopment Co. (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251243\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251243/evans-v-centerstone-development-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166-167.) We have reluctantly\noverlooked this deficiency to decide the case on the merits.\n               Turning to the substance of the appeal, a statement of decision must\n“explain[] the factual and legal basis for [the court‟s] decision as to each of the principal\n\n\n       2   All further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated.\n\n                                               7\n\fcontroverted issues at trial . . . .” (Code Civ. Proc., § 632.) But it need not make findings\non subsidiary issues even if they are material to the ultimate issues. (Kuffel v. Seaside Oil\nCo. (1977) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2169955\"><a href=\"/opinion/2169955/kuffel-v-seaside-oil-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565-566.)\n              Defendants devote a substantial portion of their briefs arguing the statement\nof decision was insufficient because it either relied on incorrect legal standards or failed\nto state a legal standard. They also contend it failed to set out required factual findings\nfor the various causes of action. The material issues here are those set out in the\nstipulated facts. Even if we look at each cause of action separately, the trial court\nexplained the required legal standards and factual findings to support the statement of\ndecision. Defendants‟ arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.\n\n\n2. Undue Influence\n              a. Trust Amendment\n              Defendants argue the statement of decision failed to set out the legal\nstandard       for undue influence concerning the trust amendment. They claim the court\nincorrectly relied on Civil Code section 1575, which applies to irrevocable inter vivos\ntransfers such as contracts and not to testamentary transfers such as the trust amendment.\n              Undue influence in a testamentary context “is pressure brought to bear\ndirectly on the testamentary act, sufficient to overcome the testator‟s free will, amounting\nin effect to coercion destroying the testator‟s free agency.” (Rice v. Clark (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521106\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521106/rice-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 96.) It is “extraordinary and abnormal pressure [that] subverts independent\nfree will and diverts it from its natural course in accordance with the dictates of another\nperson.” (Estate of Sarabia (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2126433\"><a href=\"/opinion/2126433/estate-of-sarabia/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 605, superseded by statute on\nother grounds as stated in Rice v. Clark, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521106\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521106/rice-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) “„“[T]he circumstances\nmust be inconsistent with voluntary action on the part of the testator” [citation]; and\n“[the] mere opportunity to influence the mind of the testator, even coupled with an\ninterest or a motive to do so, is not sufficient.”‟ [Citation.]” (Estate of Sarabia, supra,\n\n                                              8\n\f221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 604-605.) Defendants assert this standard was omitted from the\nstatement of decision as it made a finding Helen‟s execution of the trust amendment was\nnot based on her free will or true intent.\n              But this argument is irrelevant because the statement of decision relied on\nthe presumption of undue influence, which supplants the usual burden of proof resting on\nthe party attacking a testamentary document. (§ 8252, subd. (a).) The presumption shifts\nthe burden of proof if the challenger shows “(1) the person alleged to have exerted undue\ninfluence had a confidential relationship with the testator; (2) the person actively\nparticipated in procuring the instrument‟s preparation or execution; and (3) the person\nwould benefit unduly by the testamentary instrument.” (Rice v. Clark, supra, 28 Cal.4th\nat pp. 96-97.) The trier of fact decides whether the presumption will be applied and if it\nhas been rebutted. (Conservatorship of Davidson (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1060\ndisapproved on another ground in Bernard v. Foley (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600573\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600573/bernard-v-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 816, fn. 14.)\n              The statement of decision set out the standard and the factual basis for the\nfinding. First, Dennis, as cotrustee, had a confidential relationship with Helen. Helen\n“relied greatly” on both Doreen and Dennis, her children, as caregivers, and, although not\nmentioned, both lived with Helen for several years. We reject defendants‟ conclusory\nclaim there is no evidence they pressured Helen.\n              The second factor, procurement of execution of the amendment, which may\nbe shown by circumstantial evidence (Estate of Baker (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2153878\"><a href=\"/opinion/2153878/estate-of-baker/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 481),\nincludes the alleged wrongdoers‟ “„“control over the decedent‟s business affairs,\ndependency of the decedent upon the beneficiary for care and attention, or domination on\nthe part of the beneficiary and subserviency on the part of the deceased”‟” (ibid.). Here,\nas set out in the statement of decision, defendants were extensively involved in procuring\nthe amendment, hiring Goldberg, instead of Helen‟s usual estate planning lawyer, and\nscheduling meetings with him. Helen could not hear or see and Doreen had to point to\nwhere she should sign documents. Dennis was heavily involved in Helen‟s financial\n\n                                              9\n\faffairs. This evidence controverts defendants‟ claim they did nothing more than help\nHelen find a lawyer and, in accordance with her wishes, attend certain meetings. (Cf.\nEstate of Mann (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2121907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2121907/estate-of-mann/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 [beneficiaries‟ selection of lawyer to\nprepare trust or presence at signing alone not sufficient to support undue influence].)\n              Contrary to defendants‟ rather conclusory claim, there are also facts\nshowing they received undue profit, the third factor. Before the amendment, the five\nchildren were to share in the house equally. Afterwards, the three plaintiffs were to\nreceive no share. The house was the primary asset of the estate so the effect of the\namendment was to virtually disinherit plaintiffs.\n              Defendants argue undue profit is determined “based on a qualitative\nassessment of the evidence, not a quantitative one.” (Conservatorship of Davidson,\nsupra, 113 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) In other words, “„undue‟” depends on “„what profit\nwould be “due.”‟” (Ibid.) There was evidence Helen would not want to amend the trust\nto cut plaintiffs out of her estate. James was a cotrustee and assisted Helen with some of\nher finances. He and Laurinda lived near Helen and visited her regularly. Laurinda was\nHelen‟s attorney in fact in her health care power of attorney. Thus, under this standard\nand based on these facts, the trust amendment gave defendants an undue profit.\n              Defendants assert there was “uncontroverted evidence” of both Helen‟s true\nintent and the lack of undue profit that the court failed to consider. They set out nine\npages of evidence they claim warrants reversal. This includes testimony from caregivers\nother than defendants that Helen told them she wanted the house to go to defendants, and\nGoldberg‟s testimony he gave Helen several options as to how to divide her estate. They\nalso refer to their own testimony about outings with and care of Helen and a friend‟s\ntestimony Helen was unhappy plaintiffs did not visit more often.\n              This argument fails. The court did not have to believe any of this\ntestimony. It is reasonable to infer the court found the evidence suspect given\ndefendants‟ relationship with Helen. In addition, there was contrary evidence supporting\n\n                                             10\n\fthe presumption. Even the testimony of one witness can constitute substantial evidence,\ndespite conflicting testimony from several witnesses. (Evid. Code, § 411; City and\nCounty of San Francisco v. Givens (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2257892\"><a href=\"/opinion/2257892/city-county-of-san-francisco-v-givens/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56.) The trier of fact\nevaluates evidence and rules on the credibility of witnesses. It is not our function to\nreweigh those decisions. (White v. Inbound Aviation (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2297992\"><a href=\"/opinion/2297992/white-v-inbound-aviation/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927.)\nLikewise, when the evidence supports two or more reasonable inferences, we may not\nsubstitute our conclusion for that of the trial court. (Ortega v. Pajara Valley Unified\nSchool Dist. (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1023</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1043.)\n              We reject defendants‟ argument the court erroneously relied on Civil Code\nsection 1575 as the standard for undue influence as to the trust amendment. The court\nrelied on the presumption of undue influence. As set out below, Civil Code section 1575\nwas the the basis for the finding of undue influence as to the promissory note, trust deed,\nand lease (other documents).\n\n\n              b. Other Documents\n              Civil Code section 1575 states undue influence occurs when a party\n“tak[es] an unfair advantage of another‟s weakness of mind; or, [¶] . . . tak[es] a grossly\noppressive and unfair advantage of another‟s necessities or distress.” (Civ. Code, § 1575,\nsubds. 2, 3.) The court found the other documents were all the product of undue\ninfluence by defendants and should be set aside.\n              Defendants claim there is insufficient evidence to support the finding.\nThey assert seven factors (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist. (1966) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2186877\"><a href=\"/opinion/2186877/odorizzi-v-bloomfield-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">) are required to prove undue influence and maintain the statement of decision makes\nfindings as to none of them. These include things such as a demand a transaction be\nconcluded immediately, discussions of the transaction at an odd time, the lack of a third-\nparty adviser, and the inability to consult such an adviser. (Id. at p. 133.) But the very\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\fpremise of this argument is incorrect. Odorizzi does not presume to set out an exclusive\nlist of facts necessary to show undue influence. (Id. at p. 133.)\n              “What constitutes undue influence and what constitutes sufficient proof\nthereof depend upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case. It „is a species\nof constructive fraud which the courts will not undertake to define by any fixed\nprinciples, lest the very definition itself furnish a finger-board pointing out the path by\nwhich it may be evaded.‟ [Citation.]” (Sparks v. Sparks (1950) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1419544\"><a href=\"/opinion/1419544/sparks-v-sparks/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n135.) Undue influence “involves the use of excessive pressure to persuade one\nvulnerable to such pressure . . . .” (Odorizzi v. Bloomfield School Dist., supra, 246\nCal.App.2d at p. 131.) It “may consist of total weakness of mind which leaves a person\nentirely without understanding [citation]; or, a lesser weakness which destroys the\ncapacity of a person to make a contract even though he is not totally incapacitated . . . .”\n(Ibid.) It “need not be longlasting nor wholly incapacitating, but may be merely a lack of\nfull vigor due to age [citation], physical condition [citation] . . ., or a combination of such\nfactors. The reported cases have usually involved elderly, sick, senile persons alleged to\nhave executed wills or deeds under pressure. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n              A review of the evidence set out in detail above and the findings in the\nstatement of decision demonstrates there is substantial evidence to show undue influence.\nHelen was 90 years old and had “mental deficits,” including severe cognitive decline.\nShe slept 20 hours a day. Defendants lived with her and acted as her caregivers part of\nthe time. They secured her attorney, and Doreen had to point to where Helen should sign\nthe other documents because she could not see or hear. The court ruled Doreen‟s\ntestimony she did not know the contents of the other documents was not credible. Based\non this evidence the court reasonably found defendants exerted undue influence on\nHelen.\n              In the second argument, defendants claim the finding they did not rebut the\npresumption of undue influence under Civil Code section 1575 is legally insufficient.\n\n                                              12\n\fUndue influence in this context is “[i]n the use, by one in whom a confidence is reposed\nby another, or who holds a real or apparent authority over him, of such confidence or\nauthority for the purpose of obtaining an unfair advantage over him [or her].” (Civ.\nCode, § 1575, subd. 1.) Section 16004, subdivision (c) states, “A transaction between the\ntrustee and a beneficiary which occurs during the existence of the trust or while the\ntrustee‟s influence with the beneficiary remains and by which the trustee obtains an\nadvantage from the beneficiary is presumed to be a violation of the trustee‟s fiduciary\nduties. This presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.”\n              “There are certain relations from the existence of which the law will infer\nspecial confidence . . . . [Citation.] A confidential relation in fact should be the test.\nWhere a grantor has trust and confidence in the integrity and fidelity of the grantee and\nthe latter takes advantage of the grantor relief will be afforded. [Citation.] One who\nholds a confidential relationship will be presumed to have taken undue advantage of his\ntrusting friend unless it shall appear that the latter had independent advice and acted not\nonly of his own volition but with full comprehension of the results of his action.\n[Citation.]” (Sparks v. Sparks, supra, 101 Cal.App.2d at pp. 135-136.)\n              The court found Dennis, as cotrustee of the trust, had a confidential\nrelationship with Helen. It also determined the note and the rent free lease gave Dennis\nan advantage. Dennis failed to meet his burden to show the other documents were not a\nresult of undue influence.\n              Defendants assert the statement of decision lacked findings showing Helen\nwas not fully informed when she agreed to execute the other documents or that these\ndocuments were unfair, claiming there was uncontroverted evidence Helen wanted to\nexecute these documents. They point to testimony of the caregivers and Goldberg that\nHelen told them Dennis was owed the money. They also maintain the note and trust deed\nwere fair because Dennis had loaned father money over the years. They likewise argue\nthe lease was fair because defendants had to pay on the line of credit and because they\n\n                                              13\n\fhad not previously paid rent. But this testimony is not unrebutted, as discussed above,\nand again, defendants are asking us to reweigh evidence, a task not within our province.\nThe statement of decision was sufficient in this regard.\n              In a related argument, defendants claim there is no substantial evidence\nHelen lacked contractual capacity. Under section 811, subdivision (b) and as shown by\nthe evidence already laid out, Helen lacked the capacity to execute the other documents\nbecause her mental deficits “significantly impair[ed her] ability to understand and\nappreciate the consequences of . . . [her] actions with regard to” them. There was a direct\ncorrelation between her deficits and execution of the other documents. Defendants‟\nclaim there was insufficient evidence is another instance of their inappropriate request we\nreweigh evidence.\n\n\n3. Elder Abuse\n              a. Trust Amendment\n              Defendants argue the statement of decision finding they engaged in\nfinancial elder abuse to procure the trust amendment did not use the correct legal\nstandard. They claim Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30, which sets out the\nelements of financial elder abuse, does not apply to the trust amendment because it did\nnot transfer any property rights to them.\n              Under Welfare and Institutions Code section 15610.30 financial elder abuse\noccurs when a person “[t]akes, secretes, appropriates, obtains, or retains real or personal\nproperty of an elder,” among other things, for “wrongful use or or with intent to defraud,\nor both,” or “by undue influence, as defined in Section 1575 of the Civil Code.” (Welf.\n& Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1), (2).) A person “takes, secretes, appropriates,\nobtains, or retains real or personal property when an elder . . . is deprived of any property\nright, including by means of an agreement, donative transfer, or testamentary\nbequest . . . .” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (c), italics added.)\n\n                                             14\n\f              Although ownership of the residence did not vest in defendants at the time\nHelen signed the amendment, given her medical condition, defendants‟ control over her,\nand the fact she died three months after signing the trust amendment, at minimum\ndefendants “secrete[d]” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (a)(1), (3)) the residence\nfrom her. The effect of defendants‟ undue influence was to deprive Helen of her interest\nat the time she executed the trust amendment.\n\n\n              b. Other Documents\n              As to the other documents, defendants make only a passing reference in one\nof their headings that there was no substantial evidence of elder abuse “relying\nexclusively” on undue influence. (Boldface and capitalization omitted.) Failure to make\nany reasoned legal argument forfeits this claim. (Benach v. County of Los Angeles (2007)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2276194\"><a href=\"/opinion/2276194/benach-v-county-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 852.)\n\n\n4. Section 259\n              Defendants maintain that even if they committed elder abuse, full\ndisinheritance under section 259 was erroneous. This argument has no merit.\n              Section 259 provides four conditions that must be met before disinheritance\napplies. They are that defendants committed financial abuse (requiring proof by clear\nand convincing evidence), they acted in bad faith and were “reckless, oppressive,\nfraudulent or malicious,” and Helen was “substantially unable to manage . . . her financial\nresources or to resist fraud or undue influence” at the time of the abuse and thereafter\nuntil her death. (§ 259, subd. (a).) We have already determined these conditions were\nproven and in this argument defendants do not challenge these conditions, except to state\na conclusion there was no financial elder abuse.\n              As a result of the abuse, defendants may not “receive any property,\ndamages, or costs that are awarded to [Helen‟s] estate” resulting from an action arising\n\n                                             15\n\fout of the abuse. (§ 259, subd. (c)(1).) They are also barred from serving as Helen‟s\nfiduciary since the will or trust designating them was executed while Helen was unable to\nmanage her finances or resist undue influence of fraud. (§ 259, subd. (c)(2).) In other\nwords, section 259 “does not necessarily disinherit an abuser entirely but rather restricts\nthe abuser‟s right to benefit from his or her abusive conduct. [Citations.]” (Estate of\nDito (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 803, fn. omitted.) The statute “restricts the value of\nthe estate to which the abuser‟s percentage share is applied and prevents that person from\nbenefiting from his or her own wrongful conduct.” (Id. at p. 804.) The abusers are\nconsidered “to have predeceased the decedent only to the extent the person would have\nbeen entitled through a will, trust, or laws of intestacy to receive a distribution of the\ndamages and costs the person is found to be liable to pay to the estate as a result of the\nabuse.” (Id. at pp. 803-804, fn. omitted.)\n              The statement of decision provides that the 2010 documents were procured\nby defendants‟ undue influence. It also specifies that, because defendants committed\nfinancial elder abuse by taking an interest in Helen‟s real property by virtue of the lease,\nthey are deemed to have predeceased her. The judgment states defendants are considered\nto have predeceased Helen and the assets of the trust “are to be distributed accordingly.”\n              Defendants argue they should not be disinherited because they never “took\nany [of Helen‟s] property . . . into their own names.” They are not correct. They lived in\nthe residence rent free, Dennis received $65,000 under the note secured by a trust deed on\nthe residence, and they “secrete[d]” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.30, subd. (c)) the\nresidence from her. The 2010 documents were all cancelled and defendants were\nrequired to return all the interests they obtained via the 2010 documents.\n              Section 259 is a forfeiture statute, the purpose of which is “to deter the\nabuse of elders by prohibiting abusers from benefiting from the abuse. . . . By enacting\nthis statute, the Legislature hoped that the threat of extinguishing inheritance rights, and\nthe financial incentive to others to report abuse, would deter abuse.” (Estate of Lowrie\n\n                                              16\n\f(2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229.) In giving effect to a statute we presume the\nLegislature did not intend absurd results. (Jurcoane v. Superior Court (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2282331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2282331/jurcoane-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 893.)\n              There would be no need for the statute if defendants could engage in the\nconduct described here to pressure Helen to transfer the various interests to them and\navoid any consequences. Merely cancelling the 2010 documents and then allowing\ndefendants to share in the estate as they would have absent the abuse is no deterrence at\nall. Defendants would be in no worse position than if they had not employed the undue\ninfluence. That result would violate both the spirit and the intent of section 259.\n\n\n5. Fraud\n              Defendants complain the court failed to make a finding as to whether fraud\nwas “an independent cause of action” and challenge the statement of decision for failing\nto discuss elements or findings of fraud. This argument borders on frivolous. Review of\nthe petition shows there is no fraud cause of action, nor is the judgment for fraud.\nTherefore, there would be no need to discuss it in the statement of decision or to make\nfactual findings. The statement in the judgment the trust amendment was procured by\n“fraud/undue influence” is superfluous since the statement of decision supports a finding\nof undue influence.\n\n\n6. Testamentary Capacity\n              Defendants claim the statement of decision conflates the standard for\ntestamentary capacity with that of contractual capacity in the context of the trust\namendment. This is incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f              Section 6100.5, subdivision (a)3 provides a person is “not mentally\ncompetent to make a will if at the time of making” it the person “does not have sufficient\nmental capacity to be able to (A) understand the nature of the testamentary act, (B)\nunderstand and recollect the nature and situation of the individual‟s property, or (C)\nremember and understand the individual‟s relations to living descendants . . . and those\nwhose interests are affected by the will.” (Italics added.) Section 6100.5 applies to the\ncapacity to amend a trust by virtue of section 811. (Andersen v. Hunt (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">722</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 731.)\n              Section 811, cited in the statement of decision, lists the “mental functions”\nto be considered when a court is making a decision a person “lacks the capacity to . . . to\ncontract . . . or to execute trusts . . . .” (§ 811, subd. (a).) They include “(1) Alertness and\nattention, including, but not limited to, . . . [¶] (A) Level of arousal or\nconsciousness[ and] [¶] (B) Orientation to time, place, person, and situation.” (Ibid.) “A\ndeficit in the mental functions listed above may be considered only if the deficit, by itself\nor in combination with one or more other mental function deficits, significantly impairs\nthe person‟s ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of his or her actions\nwith regard to the type of act or decision in question.” (§ 811, subd. (b).) The court also\npointed to section 810, subdivision (c), which states that a finding a person “lack[s] the\nlegal capacity to perform a specific act” must rest on “evidence of a deficit in one or\nmore of the person‟s mental functions rather than on a diagnosis of a person‟s mental or\nphysical disorder.”\n              The statement of decision met these requirements. It laid out the evidence\nshowing Helen‟s necessity and distress based on her poor health and her heavy reliance\non defendants as caregivers. It also found Helen had “weakness of mind” “evidenced by\n\n      3 Contrary to defendants‟ claim, the statement of decision did not “dismiss” the\napplicability of section 6100.5, subdivision (a).\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fdocumented mental deficits that affected her testamentary capacity,” which defendants\ntook advantage of. It further specified there was credible evidence Helen “was not\noriented to time, place, person and situation in and around February 2010.” She slept as\nmuch as 20 hours a day around the time she executed the 2010 documents. This, and the\nevidence she could not read or hear and of her severe cognitive decline at the time she\nexecuted the trust amendment, was sufficient to show Helen was mentally incompetent.\n              The absence of a finding Helen suffered from hallucinations or delusions is\ninconsequential; that is an alternate factor proving incompetence (§ 6100.5, subd. (a)(2))\nand not required. For the same reasons as stated above, we again reject defendants‟ claim\nthere is uncontroverted evidence to show plaintiffs did not prove the section 6100.5\nfactors.\n\n\n7. Breach of Trust\n              The statement of decision found Dennis breached the trust, both as to Helen\nduring her lifetime and as to the plaintiffs after Helen‟s death. Defendants rely on trust\nlanguage that Dennis should not be liable for breach of trust if he acts in good faith and\nwithout gross negligence. He argues the statement of decision fails to include findings to\nsupport these two factors and the evidence shows he was neither grossly negligent nor\nacted in bad faith. This argument is easily disposed of.\n              There is not only sufficient evidence, there is overwhelming evidence\nDennis did not act in good faith. As set out in the statement of decision, he exerted undue\ninfluence to obtain the trust amendment whereby Helen transferred all of the interest in\nthe residence to defendants, to the exclusion of plaintiffs. He procured the $65,000 note\nin his favor secured by a deed of trust on the residence, a trust asset, and there was\nsubstantial evidence there was no consideration for the note. He also procured the lease\nof the residence on behalf of himself and Doreen, providing they were not obligated to\npay rent until after Helen‟s death. He never revealed his actions or the existence of the\n\n                                             19\n\f2010 documents to James, his cotrustee, or to any of the other plaintiffs who were trust\nbeneficiaries. He fraudulently induced James to agree to use a trust bank account to\nsubstantially pay down the line of credit secured by the residence when it would have\nbeen his personal responsibility to pay that off. And this is just some of the evidence\nshowing a breach of trust.\n              Dennis‟s one contrary argument that he had no intent to breach the trust and\ndid not know the contents of the trust amendment again improperly seeks to have us\nreweigh evidence. Since he did not act in good faith we need not discuss whether he was\nnegligent since the trust required both elements to be satisfied.\n\n\n8. Attorney Fees\n              The amount of attorney fees to be awarded is within the court‟s sound\ndiscretion, taking into account the type and difficulty of the matter, counsel‟s skill vis-à-\nvis the skill required to handle the case, counsel‟s age and experience, the time and\nattention counsel gave to the case, and the outcome. (Contractors Labor Pool, Inc. v.\nWestway Contractors, Inc. (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2273186\"><a href=\"/opinion/2273186/contractors-labor-pool-inc-v-westway-con/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168.) An experienced trial judge\nis best qualified to decide the value of an attorney‟s services in a given matter, and on\nappeal we will not reverse that decision unless it is clearly wrong. (11382 Beach\nPartnership v. Libaw (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2258470\"><a href=\"/opinion/2258470/11382-beach-partnership-v-libaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220.) We are not persuaded the trial\ncourt abused its discretion in its apportionment of the fees. The fact the court did not\nconsider all of the transactions on which plaintiffs relied to prove elder abuse is\nirrelevant. In deciding whether to segregate attorney fees, the court does not look at\nindividual pieces of evidence but at the various causes of action.\n\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n\n\n           The judgment is affirmed.
