In 2009, the plaintiffs --\n\nfourteen maintenance, domestic, and warehouse workers -- embarked\n\non a quest to seek some relief after being abruptly fired from the\n\nPuerto      Rico   executive   mansion   shortly     after        a   newly   elected\n\ngovernor took the helm.1        The plaintiffs -- to whom we'll refer as\n\n\"the       workers\"    --   sued     then-Governor         Luis       Fortuño-Burset\n\n(\"Fortuño\"), his wife, and two executive staffers, alleging that\n\nthey were terminated solely because they affiliated with Fortuño's\n\nrival political parties. The firings, the workers have maintained,\n\namounted      to   political   discrimination       prohibited        by   the   First\n\nAmendment.\n\n              After six years and two appeals, this voyage has reached\n\nits end -- for the reasons discussed below, we affirm the district\n\ncourt's      summary   judgment     disposal   of    the    workers'       political\n\ndiscrimination claim.2\n\n                                   I. BACKGROUND\n\n                            A. The Factual Skeleton\n\n              Because we are reviewing a summary judgment motion, we\n\nrecite the facts \"in a light as favorable to [the workers] as the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n       One of the fourteen plaintiffs worked at the governor's\ncountry home, and not at the executive mansion. This variance does\nnot affect our analysis.\n       2\n      The workers also appeal the district court's denial of their\nmotion to reconsider the summary judgment decisions, which we\naddress below.\n\n                                        -3-\n\frecord will reasonably allow.\"              Velázquez-Pérez v. Developers\n\nDiversified Realty Corp., 753 F.3d 265, 267 (1st Cir. 2014).\n\n            In   November   2008,     Fortuño,    of   Puerto   Rico's   New\n\nProgressive political party (\"NPP\"), defeated the incumbent, a\n\nmember of the NPP's primary rival, to become Puerto Rico's newly\n\nelected governor. Fortuño took office on January 2, 2009, bringing\n\non board a chief of staff, Juan Carlos Blanco-Urrutia (\"Blanco\"),\n\nand an administrator, Velmarie Berlingeri-Marín (\"Berlingeri\").\n\nThrough an executive order, Fortuño authorized Berlingeri to \"take\n\nany necessary actions and sign any necessary official documents\n\nrelated to the administration of the Office of the Governor,\" which\n\nincluded administering the executive mansion, where the governor\n\nlived and worked.\n\n            A few days after taking office, Fortuño issued another\n\nexecutive order declaring a statewide fiscal emergency, authorizing\n\na hiring freeze across state agencies, and requiring certain\n\nspending cuts.     The executive order required each state agency to\n\neliminate     thirty   percent   of    \"all    authorized   trust   service\n\npositions.\"      Relevant to this case, \"trust service\" employees --\n\none of several categories of employment types within the Puerto\n\nRico government -- could be \"freely remove[d],\" or, in other words,\n\nterminated without cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Shortly after the executive order was issued, each of the\n\nplaintiffs (all of whom were trust employees)3 was let go either in\n\nFebruary or March 2009, by way of written termination letters\n\nsigned by Berlingeri.       The termination letters (which were all\n\nidentical in substance) did not provide a specific reason for the\n\nfirings,   citing   only   to   the   regulations   allowing   for   \"trust\n\nservice\" employees to be \"freely selected and freely dismissed.\"\n\nBerlingeri has since asserted that some of the workers were fired\n\n-- based on the recommendation of their immediate supervisors --\n\nbecause of their poor work performance; others, she claimed, were\n\nfired due to the budget cuts.\n\n                    B. The (Long) Procedural History\n\n           Wasting no time, in March 2009, the workers sued Fortuño,\n\nhis chief of staff (Blanco), his administrator (Berlingeri), and\n\nhis wife, First Lady Luz E. Vela-Gutiérrez (\"Vela\"), asserting that\n\neach of the defendants had a role in their allegedly unlawful\n\nterminations and claiming they were fired because they affiliated\n\nwith non-NPP political parties.        The workers' complaint brought §\n\n1983 claims,4 alleging violation of their due process and equal\n\n\n\n     3\n       During the summary judgment proceedings before the district\ncourt, the workers took issue with documentation the defendants\nused to verify that a few of the plaintiffs were trust employees.\nBut the plaintiffs did not dispute there (or in their briefing to\nus) that they were in fact part of the trust service.\n     4\n      42 U.S.C. § 1983 allows plaintiffs to sue for constitutional\nviolations.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fprotection rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and\n\ntheir right to free speech under the First Amendment.5           They also\n\nsought relief under numerous Puerto Rico laws and the Puerto Rico\n\nconstitution.\n\n          In    July   2009,   the   defendants   moved   to   dismiss   the\n\nworkers' claims, arguing that the complaint failed to state a\n\nplausible claim for relief. The district court allowed that motion\n\nand dismissed all of the federal and state claims against all of\n\nthe defendants.\n\n          Apparently     abandoning    their   due   process   claim,    the\n\nemployees appealed only the dismissal of their First Amendment and\n\nstate law causes of action;6 we vacated the dismissal of those\n\nclaims and remanded them to the district court.                See Ocasio-\n\nHernández v. Fortuño-Burset, 640 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n          With the case back before the trial court, discovery\n\nensued. At its close, the defendants moved for summary judgment on\n\nthe remaining political discrimination claim, arguing that the\n\nworkers could not show that the defendants knew of their political\n\n\n\n     5\n       The workers later amended their complaint. We refer to the\namended complaint (which is the operative one in this case) as \"the\ncomplaint.\"\n     6\n       Readers may be wondering why this case feels so familiar.\nThe answer is likely because our 2011 decision, which involved the\nsame parties, has become well known (and frequently cited) for its\ndetailed explanation of the applicable standard of review for a\nmotion to dismiss. See Ocasio-Hernández v. Fortuño-Burset, 640\nF.3d 1, 12-13 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fviews or that politics was a reason for the terminations.         In a\n\nwritten order, the court allowed the motion as to Fortuño, Vela,\n\nand Blanco on the grounds that there was no evidence that these\n\ndefendants were aware of the workers' political affiliations or\n\nthat they were personally involved in the terminations.      The court\n\nheld off on Berlingeri because it wanted to engage in \"additional\n\nand deeper analysis\" and hear oral argument before deciding whether\n\nto dismiss the claim against her.          The court later ended up\n\ndismissing Berlingeri from the case as well, in a separate written\n\ndecision concluding that there was insufficient evidence that\n\npolitical affiliation was the reason for the dismissals.7 The\n\nworkers then moved the district court to reconsider its judgment,\n\nwhich the court denied.\n\n              The workers now bring the case to us once again; on\n\nresurgence, they ask us to reverse the district court's summary\n\njudgment disposal of their First Amendment claim, as well as the\n\ncourt's subsequent denial of their motion to amend the judgment.\n\n              We address both rulings in turn.\n\n                         II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n              We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.       Velázquez-Pérez, 753 F.3d at 270.     Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate only if the moving party \"shows that there is no\n\n\n\n        7\n       The court also dismissed the state law claims against all\nthe defendants, which the workers do not appeal.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fgenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).      We\n\nconsider a dispute genuine if \"a reasonable jury, drawing favorable\n\ninferences, could resolve it in favor of the nonmoving party.\"\n\nVelázquez-Pérez, 753 F.3d at 270 (citation and quotations omitted).\n\nBut   \"[c]onclusory     allegations,    improbable     inferences,   and\n\nunsupported speculation[] are insufficient to establish a genuine\n\ndispute of fact.\"     Id. (citation and quotations omitted).\n\n          To succeed in showing that there is no genuine dispute of\n\nmaterial fact, the moving party must direct us to specific evidence\n\nin the record that would be admissible at trial.       That is, it must\n\n\"affirmatively produce evidence that negates an essential element\n\nof the non-moving party's claim,\" or, using \"evidentiary materials\n\nalready on file . . . demonstrate that the non-moving party will be\n\nunable to carry its burden of persuasion at trial.\"          Carmona v.\n\nToledo, 215 F.3d 124, 132 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations omitted).\n\n\"[I]f the summary judgment record satisfactorily demonstrates that\n\nthe plaintiff's case is, and may be expected to remain, deficient\n\nin vital evidentiary support, this may suffice to show that the\n\nmovant has met its initial burden.\"      Id. at 133.\n\n                            III. DISCUSSION\n\n                          A. Summary Judgment\n\n          The dispute before us arises from the well established\n\nconstitutional mandate prohibiting government officials from firing\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fpublic employees on the basis of their political affiliations.8                To\n\nprove political discrimination, the workers must show that: (1)\n\nthey and the defendants have \"opposing political affiliations,\" (2)\n\nthe defendants were aware of the workers' political affiliations,\n\n(3)   an    \"adverse    employment        action\"   (e.g.,    an     employment\n\ntermination)   occurred,     and    (4)     \"political    affiliation    was    a\n\nsubstantial    or   motivating      factor    for   the   adverse    employment\n\naction.\"9   Ocasio-Hernández, 640 F.3d at 13.\n\n            Here, the district court held in a written ruling that\n\nthe workers \"failed to come up with any evidence to the effect that\n\n[Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco] were aware of their adverse political\n\naffiliation,    and    as   such,    that    partisan     politics    played   a\n\n\n\n\n      8\n      While not applicable in this case, an exception to this rule\nis when \"political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for\nthe position.\" García-González v. Puig-Morales, 761 F.3d 81, 92\n(1st Cir. 2014) (citation and quotations omitted).\n      9\n       The workers expend a good bit of effort in their opening\nbrief trying to convince us that they have successfully\ncircumvented   the    defendants'  Mt.   Healthy  defense.      See\nPadilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez, 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir.\n2000) (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)) (holding that after the plaintiffs make\na prima facie showing of political discrimination, the government\nofficial is then \"given the opportunity to establish that it would\nhave taken the same action regardless of the plaintiff's political\nbeliefs\"); Padilla-Garcia, 212 F.3d at 77 (\"[T]he plaintiff may\ndiscredit   the    proffered   nondiscriminatory   reason,   either\ncircumstantially    or   directly,   by  adducing   evidence   that\ndiscrimination was more likely than not a motivating factor [in the\ntermination decision].\"). We need not reach Mt. Healthy at all in\nthis case because -- as we explain below -- the workers have not\nmet their threshold prima facie burden.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fsubstantial or motivating role\" in the terminations.10            Later, in\n\na separate written ruling addressing the remaining defendant,\n\nBerlingeri, the trial judge acknowledged that the \"parties disagree\n\nwhether     Berlingeri    had   knowledge      of   Plaintiffs'   political\n\naffiliations,\"    but    \"refrain[ed]   from    passing   judgment   on    the\n\nknowledge requirement\" because it was \"dismiss[ing] Plaintiffs'\n\nclaims on alternative grounds,\" i.e., causation.\n\n            As we explain below, we agree with the district court\n\nthat the record lacks sufficient evidence that Fortuño, Vela, and\n\nBlanco were aware of the plaintiffs' political affiliations.              And,\n\nalthough the district court did not address Berlingeri's knowledge,\n\nwe conclude that the record does not provide enough evidence of\n\nhers either, and affirm both summary judgment rulings on that\n\nground.11\n\n\n     10\n        The court also found that there was no evidence that\nFortuño, Vela, or Blanco were personally involved in the\nterminations, which is also a requirement for any constitutional\nclaim against a government official. See Ocasio-Hernández, 640\nF.3d at 16. Because we are affirming on other grounds, we need not\naddress that issue.\n     11\n       With the exception discussed below, the defendants do not\nmake an issue of elements one or three of the political\ndiscrimination test on appeal. They do argue (as they did before\nthe district court) that the workers' case fails as to both the\nknowledge and causation prongs (elements two and four) as to all\nthe defendants.\n          The district court dismissed the claim against Berlingeri\nas to a single plaintiff, Iván Rivera, on the ground that he did\nnot have an opposing political affiliation (element one of the\npolitical discrimination test).    Following suit, the defendants\nargue that because Rivera \"is a member of the NPP and admittedly\nvoted for Fortuño . . . in the 2008 general elections,\" he does not\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          We delve into our discussion by first noting that the\n\nworkers' opening brief does not address the sufficiency of evidence\n\nof knowledge, focusing instead on causation.     At oral argument,\n\ncounsel explained the workers' position that \"given that the\n\n[trial] judge did not decide [knowledge,] . . . [that issue] was to\n\nbe decided in favor of the plaintiff, and that for purposes of\n\nappeal, [the court] must assume that the defendants knew of [the\n\nworkers'] political affiliation.\"\n\n          As we suggested at oral argument, counsel's statement is\n\nincorrect in three respects.\n\n          First, the workers appear to have imparted a holding that\n\nwas specific to Berlingeri on the rest of the defendants.    As we\n\nnoted above, the district court did rule on knowledge as to\n\ndefendants Fortuño, Blanco, and Vela, but separately from its\n\nruling on Berlingeri.12\n\n\nhave an opposing political affiliation. As we have noted before,\nhowever, being a member of the same political party does not\nnecessarily alter the \"constitutionally protected status\" of a\nperson's political affiliations. Padilla-Garcia, 212 F.3d at 76 &\nn.6. See also Anthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir.\n1991) (\"We do not think that liability in a political\ndiscrimination    case   involving    non-policymaking    positions\nnecessarily depends on a finding that the defendants knew to a\ncertainty that the ousted jobholders were members of the opposition\nparty.\"). We need not address the specifics of what might save\nRivera on the first prong, however, because in any event, we affirm\non the lack of evidence regarding the defendants' knowledge of any\nof the plaintiffs' political affiliations.\n     12\n       Given that the summary judgment ruling that addressed the\nclaims against Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco was not included in the\nnotice of appeal, perhaps the workers simply overlooked the fact\n\n                               -11-\n\f          Second, the workers incorrectly suggest that the district\n\ncourt's choice not to address Berlingeri's knowledge equated to a\n\nruling in their favor on that particular issue.\n\n          Third, based on their misapprehension that the district\n\ncourt ruled in their favor on Berlingeri's knowledge, the workers\n\nassume that we are now obligated to adopt the district court's\n\nruling in that regard, thus choosing to focus their arguments on\n\nthe causation element.\n\n          Here are the problems with the workers' logic.      On de\n\nnovo review of a summary judgment motion, we undertake the same\n\ninquiry as the district court -- we look at whether the supported\n\nfacts, when considered as a whole, are legally sufficient to\n\nsatisfy each element of a claim.    Here, the district court did not\n\ndecide one way or another whether the knowledge element was\n\nsatisfied as to Berlingeri.        It simply found that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence in the record to satisfy a different element\n\n\n\n\nthat those particular defendants were dismissed in a separate\nruling from Berlingeri.\n     Despite the workers' failure to include both summary judgment\nrulings in the notice of appeal, a mistake that generally divests\nus of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n3(c)(1)(C), we still review them both.      The notice of appeal\nreferences the judgment entered against all the defendants, and\nboth parties briefed (and argued) the merits of the dismissals of\nthe First Amendment claim as to all the defendants. Therefore,\ndespite it being \"carelessly drafted,\" the notice of appeal\n\"provides a sufficient foundation for the exercise of appellate\njurisdiction over the original order of dismissal.\" Chamorro v.\nPuerto Rican Cars, Inc., 304 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                               -12-\n\fof the workers' claim (i.e., causation), and dismissed Berlingeri\n\non that ground.\n\n          Even if the district court had ruled, in the workers'\n\nfavor, that the record showed sufficient evidence of Berlingeri's\n\nknowledge, on de novo review, we do not just assume the district\n\ncourt was correct in its ruling.   Rather, we take a fresh look at\n\nthe record to determine for ourselves whether the plaintiffs met\n\ntheir evidentiary burden.13   In so doing, \"we are not bound by the\n\ndistrict court's decisional calculus but, rather, may affirm the\n\ndecision below on any ground made manifest by the record.\" Ruiz v.\n\nBally Total Fitness Holding Corp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          As we will explain, upon our review of the record, a jury\n\ncould not reasonably infer that any of the defendants were aware of\n\nthe workers' political affiliations.      Because the plaintiffs' case\n\nfails on that element, we need not address any others.\n\n                              Knowledge\n\n          Even though the workers mistakenly presumed that the\n\nknowledge element was satisfied as to all of the defendants, we\n\ngave the workers a chance at oral argument to point us to what, if\n\nany, evidence in the record suggests that any of the defendants\n\nwere aware of their political affiliations.      The workers conceded\n\n\n\n     13\n       We further note that we allowed the workers' motion to waive\nthe filing of an appendix and, per the workers' request, conducted\nour review of this case \"on the original record.\" Thus, we had no\nchoice but to independently scour the summary judgment record.\n\n                                -13-\n\fthat the record offered no direct evidence that the defendants knew\n\nof their political inclinations, but urged us to infer that because\n\nthe workers were hired by a prior administration, the defendants\n\nmust have known that they were not affiliated with Fortuño's party.\n\n            We recognize that political discrimination, which often\n\nturns on an employer's cloaked motives, can be hard for a worker to\n\nto prove.     In so recognizing, we have consistently held that\n\ncircumstantial evidence can suffice to show a defendant's knowledge\n\nof a plaintiff's political party.           See, e.g., Martinez-Vélez v.\n\nRey-Hernández, 506 F.3d 32, 44 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that a jury\n\ncould   reasonably   infer   that     the   defendant    was   aware   of   the\n\nplaintiff's NPP affiliation based on testimony that the plaintiff\n\n\"spoke openly about her political views and sat in the NPP portion\n\nof the de facto segregated cafeteria\").          We have also held that a\n\ngovernment official's knowledge that an employee was hired by a\n\nprior administration -- when considered in tandem with other\n\nrelevant facts -- could certainly help prove the defendant's\n\nknowledge of the employee's political affiliation.                 See, e.g.,\n\nAnthony v. Sundlun, 952 F.2d 603, 606 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Given the\n\nnature of the [employees'] positions, the defendants' knowledge\n\nthat the plaintiffs had originally been hired by the previous []\n\nadministration, the timing of the moves, the identities of those\n\nconsulted, the lack of any legitimate reason for ousting the\n\nincumbents,   and    the   partisan    connections      of   the   replacement\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fworkers, it seems disingenuous to suggest that [the defendant]\n\nacted without regard to the politics of the situation.\").\n\n          Beside the fact that here, the workers' argument lies on\n\na shaky factual premise (the defendants claim, and the workers do\n\nnot refute, that two of the plaintiffs were actually hired under an\n\nNPP administration), more generally, a defendant's mere knowledge\n\nthat an employee was hired by a prior governor -- without more --\n\nis not sufficient to show political discrimination.    Were that the\n\ncase, a newly elected governor could never impose budget-related\n\n(or other legitimate) layoffs.   See Martinez-Vélez, 506 F.3d at 42\n\n(concluding that if reorganization \"was hatched as a plan to clear\n\nthe decks of NPP [employees] so that PDP [employees] could be\n\nfavored, it was up to plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery\n\nand offer the evidence [at trial].      Liability without such proof\n\nwould effectively preclude any post-election reorganization that\n\nhappens to affect adversely employees connected to the previously\n\ndominant party.\").\n\n          Significantly, as the defendants have pointed out, the\n\nworkers here have directed us to no evidence showing that the\n\ndefendants they sued had knowledge of their particular political\n\naffiliations.   The record actually suggests the opposite -- a\n\nnumber of the plaintiffs testified at their depositions that\n\nmansion employees did not usually discuss at work the political\n\nparties to which they belonged, employees' political affiliations\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fwere not common knowledge within the mansion, and the plaintiffs\n\ndid not discuss politics in general at work.             The workers have\n\ndirected us to no evidence in the voluminous record to refute the\n\nveracity of their own testimony. See Torres-Martínez v. P.R. Dep't\n\nof Corr., 485 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"[A]s to issues on which\n\nthe summary judgment target[s] bear[] the ultimate burden of proof,\n\n[they] cannot rely on an absence of competent evidence, but must\n\naffirmatively    point   to   specific   facts    that   demonstrate   the\n\nexistence of an authentic dispute.\") (citation and quotations\n\nomitted).    When all is said and done, the workers have offered no\n\nproof that others in the mansion -- let alone the higher ups -- had\n\nknowledge of their political leanings.           As we have held in the\n\npast, while \"an incoming administration may not use a systematic\n\nreorganization to effectuate otherwise impermissible terminations,\"\n\nin order to defeat summary judgment, the plaintiffs have the burden\n\nof directing us to sufficient record evidence to \"create a triable\n\nissue.\"     Rodríguez-Sanchez v. Municipality of Santa Isabel, 658\n\nF.3d 125, 130-31 (1st Cir. 2011) (citation omitted).\n\n            We acknowledge that it is certainly curious that more\n\nthan a dozen workers -- almost none of whom affiliated with their\n\nnew boss's political party -- were all terminated within a couple\n\nmonths of the new governor's move into the mansion.14 But we cannot\n\n\n     14\n        While the \"temporal proximity between the change in\npolitical administration and the turnover of staff . . .\nunquestionably contributes . . . to the reasonable inference that\n\n                                  -16-\n\fallow    a     case   to   proceed   to    trial   based    on    unsubstantiated\n\nsuspicion.       The workers do not even offer generalized statistical\n\nevidence showing how many NPP employees were retained after the\n\nlayoffs (as compared to non-NPP employees), whether NPP employees\n\nwere also given the boot, or whether the terminated workers were\n\nreplaced with NPP affiliates. See Anthony, 952 F.2d at 606 (noting\n\nthat    even    though     the   record   showed   that    most   of   the   ousted\n\nplaintiffs were replaced by members of the opposing political\n\nparty, \"these raw numbers alone [still] are likely insufficient to\n\nground a finding of patronage dismissal\"); Figueroa-Serrano v.\n\nRamos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting that in their\n\nunsuccessful attempt to defeat summary judgment, \"plaintiffs' most\n\nviable claim, the allegation that similarly situated [opposing\n\nparty] members were not fired, lacked factual support,\" and that\n\nplaintiffs \"failed to provide names or other specific factual\n\ninformation supporting their claim that the [government] replaced\n\nthem with new hires from the [opposing political party]\"). Because\n\nthe workers have simply failed to meet their burden, we must affirm\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment.\n\n\n\n\nthe employment decision was politically motivated,\" Ocasio-\nHernández, 640 F.3d at 18, dubious timing, on its own, is still not\nenough to prove the defendants had a discriminatory motive, id.,\nlet alone knowledge of a plaintiffs' politics. See also Anthony,\n952 F.2d at 606 (considering timing of the terminations as one of\nseveral circumstantial facts used to infer the defendants'\nknowledge of plaintiffs' political affiliations).\n\n                                          -17-\n\f                     B. Motion to Alter Judgment\n\n           The workers also argue that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their request to reconsider the judgment, pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e).           We grant Rule 59(e) relief\n\n\"when the original judgment evidenced a manifest error of law, if\n\nthere is newly discovered evidence, or in certain other narrow\n\nsituations.\"    Biltcliffe v. CitiMortgage, Inc., 772 F.3d 925, 930\n\n(1st Cir. 2014)   (citation and quotations omitted).           The workers'\n\nonly articulated basis for appealing the denial of the motion to\n\nreconsider is the \"permitting of the evidence which was not\n\nproperly before the Court.\"       While the workers do not elaborate on\n\nwhat evidence they refer to, based on discussion earlier in their\n\nbrief, we assume they object to the district court's apparent\n\nreliance on deposition testimony stating that Berlingeri received\n\nnegative employee evaluations from the workers' direct supervisors.\n\nThe   workers   contend    that   this    testimony    evidence   would   be\n\ninadmissible.\n\n           Whether   the    district     court    considered   inadmissible\n\nhearsay to resolve the causation question is an orthogonal issue,\n\ngiven that we are affirming on other of this case's shortfalls. We\n\nneedn't say more on the point.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\f                           IV. THE FAREWELL\n\n             The first time this case was before us, we expressed\n\noutright our appreciation that the workers' allegations, as set out\n\nin   their   complaint,   \"unquestionably   describe[d]   a   plausible\n\ndiscriminatory sequence that is all too familiar in this circuit.\"\n\nOcasio-Hernández, 640 F.3d at 19.       For laundry room workers, and\n\nmaintenance staff, and warehouse employees -- who have no direct\n\nsay in or influence on the policies of the government by which they\n\nare employed -- to face recurring fear that their livelihood will\n\nbe pulled out from under them every time the state sees a change in\n\nleadership is, to say the least, a sad state of affairs.        As the\n\ndistrict court judge suggested, perhaps the workers here were\n\nunable to prove their case because they were stymied by the\n\nmechanics of litigation deadlines.      Or perhaps the facts of their\n\ncase simply didn't stack up.      But unlike our assessment of the\n\nsufficiency of a complaint, where we take the veracity of the\n\nallegations at face-value, once summary judgment rolls around, the\n\nproof is in the pudding.\n\n             For the reasons discussed above, we affirm both summary\n\njudgment dismissals of the workers' First Amendment claim, as well\n\nas the denial of their motion to reconsider.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f",

In 2009, the plaintiffs --\n\nfourteen maintenance, domestic, and warehouse workers -- embarked\n\non a quest to seek some relief after being abruptly fired from the\n\nPuerto      Rico   executive   mansion   shortly     after        a   newly   elected\n\ngovernor took the helm.1        The plaintiffs -- to whom we'll refer as\n\n\"the       workers\"    --   sued     then-Governor         Luis       Fortuño-Burset\n\n(\"Fortuño\"), his wife, and two executive staffers, alleging that\n\nthey were terminated solely because they affiliated with Fortuño's\n\nrival political parties.

Fortuño took office on January 2, 2009, bringing\n\non board a chief of staff, Juan Carlos Blanco-Urrutia (\"Blanco\"),\n\nand an administrator, Velmarie Berlingeri-Marín (\"Berlingeri\").\n\nThrough an executive order, Fortuño authorized Berlingeri to \"take\n\nany necessary actions and sign any necessary official documents\n\nrelated to the administration of the Office of the Governor,\" which\n\nincluded administering the executive mansion, where the governor\n\nlived and worked.\n\n            A few days after taking office, Fortuño issued another\n\nexecutive order declaring a statewide fiscal emergency, authorizing\n\na hiring freeze across state agencies, and requiring certain\n\nspending cuts.     The executive order required each state agency to\n\neliminate     thirty   percent   of    \"all    authorized   trust   service\n\npositions.\"      Relevant to this case, \"trust service\" employees --\n\none of several categories of employment types within the Puerto\n\nRico government -- could be \"freely remove[d],\" or, in other words,\n\nterminated without cause.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Shortly after the executive order was issued, each of the\n\nplaintiffs (all of whom were trust employees)3 was let go either in\n\nFebruary or March 2009, by way of written termination letters\n\nsigned by Berlingeri.       The termination letters (which were all\n\nidentical in substance) did not provide a specific reason for the\n\nfirings,   citing   only   to   the   regulations   allowing   for   \"trust\n\nservice\" employees to be \"freely selected and freely dismissed.\"\n\nBerlingeri has since asserted that some of the workers were fired\n\n-- based on the recommendation of their immediate supervisors --\n\nbecause of their poor work performance; others, she claimed, were\n\nfired due to the budget cuts.\n\n                    B. The (Long) Procedural History\n\n           Wasting no time, in March 2009, the workers sued Fortuño,\n\nhis chief of staff (Blanco), his administrator (Berlingeri), and\n\nhis wife, First Lady Luz E. Vela-Gutiérrez (\"Vela\"), asserting that\n\neach of the defendants had a role in their allegedly unlawful\n\nterminations and claiming they were fired because they affiliated\n\nwith non-NPP political parties.        The workers' complaint brought §\n\n1983 claims,4 alleging violation of their due process and equal\n\n\n\n     3\n       During the summary judgment proceedings before the district\ncourt, the workers took issue with documentation the defendants\nused to verify that a few of the plaintiffs were trust employees.\nBut the plaintiffs did not dispute there (or in their briefing to\nus) that they were in fact part of the trust service.\n     4\n      42 U.S.C. § 1983 allows plaintiffs to sue for constitutional\nviolations.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fprotection rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and\n\ntheir right to free speech under the First Amendment.5           They also\n\nsought relief under numerous Puerto Rico laws and the Puerto Rico\n\nconstitution.\n\n          In    July   2009,   the   defendants   moved   to   dismiss   the\n\nworkers' claims, arguing that the complaint failed to state a\n\nplausible claim for relief. The district court allowed that motion\n\nand dismissed all of the federal and state claims against all of\n\nthe defendants.\n\n          Apparently     abandoning    their   due   process   claim,    the\n\nemployees appealed only the dismissal of their First Amendment and\n\nstate law causes of action;6 we vacated the dismissal of those\n\nclaims and remanded them to the district court.

We refer to the\namended complaint (which is the operative one in this case) as \"the\ncomplaint.\"\n     6\n       Readers may be wondering why this case feels so familiar.\nThe answer is likely because our 2011 decision, which involved the\nsame parties, has become well known (and frequently cited) for its\ndetailed explanation of the applicable standard of review for a\nmotion to dismiss.

In a\n\nwritten order, the court allowed the motion as to Fortuño, Vela,\n\nand Blanco on the grounds that there was no evidence that these\n\ndefendants were aware of the workers' political affiliations or\n\nthat they were personally involved in the terminations.      The court\n\nheld off on Berlingeri because it wanted to engage in \"additional\n\nand deeper analysis\" and hear oral argument before deciding whether\n\nto dismiss the claim against her.          The court later ended up\n\ndismissing Berlingeri from the case as well, in a separate written\n\ndecision concluding that there was insufficient evidence that\n\npolitical affiliation was the reason for the dismissals.7 The\n\nworkers then moved the district court to reconsider its judgment,\n\nwhich the court denied.\n\n              The workers now bring the case to us once again; on\n\nresurgence, they ask us to reverse the district court's summary\n\njudgment disposal of their First Amendment claim, as well as the\n\ncourt's subsequent denial of their motion to amend the judgment.\n\n              We address both rulings in turn.\n\n                         II.

And,\n\nalthough the district court did not address Berlingeri's knowledge,\n\nwe conclude that the record does not provide enough evidence of\n\nhers either, and affirm both summary judgment rulings on that\n\nground.11\n\n\n     10\n        The court also found that there was no evidence that\nFortuño, Vela, or Blanco were personally involved in the\nterminations, which is also a requirement for any constitutional\nclaim against a government official. See Ocasio-Hernández, 640\nF.3d at 16. Because we are affirming on other grounds, we need not\naddress that issue.\n     11\n       With the exception discussed below, the defendants do not\nmake an issue of elements one or three of the political\ndiscrimination test on appeal. They do argue (as they did before\nthe district court) that the workers' case fails as to both the\nknowledge and causation prongs (elements two and four) as to all\nthe defendants.\n          The district court dismissed the claim against Berlingeri\nas to a single plaintiff, Iván Rivera, on the ground that he did\nnot have an opposing political affiliation (element one of the\npolitical discrimination test).    Following suit, the defendants\nargue that because Rivera \"is a member of the NPP and admittedly\nvoted for Fortuño . . . in the 2008 general elections,\" he does not\n\n                                   -10-\n\f          We delve into our discussion by first noting that the\n\nworkers' opening brief does not address the sufficiency of evidence\n\nof knowledge, focusing instead on causation.     At oral argument,\n\ncounsel explained the workers' position that \"given that the\n\n[trial] judge did not decide [knowledge,] . . . [that issue] was to\n\nbe decided in favor of the plaintiff, and that for purposes of\n\nappeal, [the court] must assume that the defendants knew of [the\n\nworkers'] political affiliation.\"\n\n          As we suggested at oral argument, counsel's statement is\n\nincorrect in three respects.\n\n          First, the workers appear to have imparted a holding that\n\nwas specific to Berlingeri on the rest of the defendants.

We need not address the specifics of what might save\nRivera on the first prong, however, because in any event, we affirm\non the lack of evidence regarding the defendants' knowledge of any\nof the plaintiffs' political affiliations.\n     12\n       Given that the summary judgment ruling that addressed the\nclaims against Fortuño, Vela, and Blanco was not included in the\nnotice of appeal, perhaps the workers simply overlooked the fact\n\n                               -11-\n\f          Second, the workers incorrectly suggest that the district\n\ncourt's choice not to address Berlingeri's knowledge equated to a\n\nruling in their favor on that particular issue.\n\n          Third, based on their misapprehension that the district\n\ncourt ruled in their favor on Berlingeri's knowledge, the workers\n\nassume that we are now obligated to adopt the district court's\n\nruling in that regard, thus choosing to focus their arguments on\n\nthe causation element.\n\n          Here are the problems with the workers' logic.      On de\n\nnovo review of a summary judgment motion, we undertake the same\n\ninquiry as the district court -- we look at whether the supported\n\nfacts, when considered as a whole, are legally sufficient to\n\nsatisfy each element of a claim.    Here, the district court did not\n\ndecide one way or another whether the knowledge element was\n\nsatisfied as to Berlingeri.        It simply found that there was\n\ninsufficient evidence in the record to satisfy a different element\n\n\n\n\nthat those particular defendants were dismissed in a separate\nruling from Berlingeri.\n     Despite the workers' failure to include both summary judgment\nrulings in the notice of appeal, a mistake that generally divests\nus of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\n3(c)(1)(C), we still review them both.      The notice of appeal\nreferences the judgment entered against all the defendants, and\nboth parties briefed (and argued) the merits of the dismissals of\nthe First Amendment claim as to all the defendants.
