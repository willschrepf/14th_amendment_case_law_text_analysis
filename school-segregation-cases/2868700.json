INTRODUCTION\n\nThis matter comes before this court on an appeal by\n plaintiffs United States Land Resources, L.P. (\"USLR\"),\n United States Realty Resources, Inc. (\"USRR\"), Black Horse\n Lane Associates, L.P. (\"Black Horse\"), and Lawrence S.\n Berger (\"Berger\") (collectively \"appellants\") from two orders\n entered by the district court in this matter: (1) the order\n entered August 10, 1999, granting a motion by appellees\n Dow Chemical Corporation (\"Dow\") and Essex Chemical\n Corporation (\"Essex\") for summary judgment pursuant to\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and denying appellants' cross-motion for\n summary judgment on appellees' counterclaim; and (2) the\n \"Final Order\" entered December 16, 1999, affirming the\n June 30, 1999 order of the magistrate judge imposing\n sanctions against appellants, and dismissing appellees'\n counterclaim without prejudice for lack of subject matter\n jurisdiction. This litigation arises out of a sale of\n environmentally distressed real property located at 120\n Black Horse Lane, South Brunswick, New Jersey\n (hereinafter \"the Property\"), by Essex to USLR.\n\n                                 2\n\n\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we will affirm the August 10,\n 1999 and December 16, 1999 orders of the district court in\n all respects.\n\nII. FACTS and PROCEEDINGS\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nThe historical facts in this case are rather straightforward\n and, insofar as material to this appeal, essentially are not\n disputed. Appellants, USLR, USRR, Black Horse, and\n Berger, are related entities: USLR is the general partner in\n Black Horse, USRR is the general partner of USLR, and\n Berger is the president of USRR.1 Appellees Essex and Dow\n also are related entities as Essex is Dow's wholly-owned\n subsidiary by virtue of its purchase of all of Essex's stock\n in 1988.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Essex owned and operated the\n Property, where it engaged in the business of preparing\n\f adhesive-backed paper products. On or about August 17,\n 1984, Essex discovered that chemicals it used in that\n process had leaked into the ground of the Property. In\n October 1984, Essex entered into environmental cleanup\n and decommission negotiations with the New Jersey\n Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\"). Essex\n submitted a \"Clean-Up Plan\" to the DEP on December 19,\n 1985, which the DEP conditionally approved on December\n 20, 1985.\n\nPrior to Essex's submission of the Clean-Up Plan to the\n DEP, it entered into a sales agreement (\"the Agreement\") on\n September 5, 1985, with USLR to sell the Property to USLR\n for $3.6 million. The parties do not dispute that appellants\n were aware of the Property's environmental problems at the\n time that USLR and Essex entered into the Agreement. The\n Agreement required Essex to obtain and implement an\n approved Clean-Up Plan at its sole expense. Paragraph 16\n of the Agreement set forth Essex's responsibilities with\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Also, Berger is a named partner in the lawfirm representing\n appellants.\n\n                                3\n\n\n\nrespect to the remediation and detoxification of the\n Property:\n\n       The parties acknowledge that the Subject Premises to\n        be conveyed are subject to the provisions of the\n        Environmental Clean-Up Responsibility Act, N.J.S.A.\n        13:1K-6 et seq. (`ECRA') [now named the Industrial Site\n        Recovery Act (`ISRA')]. Seller agrees to obtain approval\n        of a Clean-Up Plan from the Department of\n        Environmental Protection (`DEP'), post the necessary\n        financial security for performance pursuant to ECRA,\n        will implement the approved Clean-Up Plan and\n        complete the detoxification of the Subject Premises in\n        accordance with and to the approval of the DEP.\n        Pending DEP approval of a Clean-Up Plan, Seller will\n        attempt to obtain the consent of the DEP to the\n        conveyance of the Subject Premises. `ECRA Approval'\n        will be deemed to have taken place upon the receipt by\n        Seller from the DEP of the approval of the\n        implementation of the Clean-Up Plan and satisfactory\n        detoxification of the Subject Premises or a consent\n        from the DEP to convey the Subject Premises to\n        Purchaser in the form of an Administrative Consent\n        Order and bond securing the detoxification of the\n        Subject Premises by Seller, all in a form and substance\n        satisfactory to Purchaser's mortgage lender. In no event\n\f       shall Purchaser be obligated under this Contract to\n       assume any ECRA Clean-Up responsibilities. If ECRA\n       Approval is not obtained prior to January 1, 1986,\n       Purchaser shall have the continuing right to terminate\n       this Contract by giving Seller notice at any time up to\n       January 20, 1986. If ECRA Approval is not obtained by\n       June 1, 1986, this Contract shall be automatically\n       terminated and after the refund of the Deposit to\n       Purchaser, neither party shall have any rights or\n       claims against the other arising out of this Contract.\n\nApp. at 93a-94a. Title to the Property closed on December\n 23, 1985, three days after the DEP conditionally approved\n the Clean-Up Plan, and on that day USLR assigned its\n rights in the Property to its present owner, appellant Black\n Horse.\n\n                                4\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, at some point in 1988, appellee\n Dow purchased all of Essex's stock, and Essex became a\n wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow. Since that time, Dow\n employees have been involved in the remediation and\n detoxification of the Property, but these Dow employees\n have been acting as \"consultants\" to Essex in that\n connection. SA at 546, 549.\n\nEssex began its soil remediation efforts shortly after it\n sold the Property in 1985. While we are not able to\n ascertain the exact date of completion from the record,\n appellants' counsel confirmed at oral argument that soil\n remediation was finished within two years of the sale of the\n Property. See generally app. at 235a; SA at 536; appellees'\n br. at 17. Essex commenced groundwater remediation in\n 1988, app. at 236a, but, to date, it has not completed that\n remediation. It is Essex's alleged failure to complete\n remediation and detoxification of the Property within a\n \"reasonable time\" that forms the crux of the parties' dispute\n in this case.\n\nOne specific example that appellants cite as proof of\n Essex's alleged failure to remediate the Property within a\n reasonable time pertains to Essex's cleanup efforts with\n respect to certain \"chlorinated volatile organic compounds\"\n (\"CVOCs\") found in the soil and groundwater in certain\n areas of the Property.2 In 1991, the DEP ordered Essex to\n perform a \"temporary well point survey\" to investigate the\n presence and source of CVOCs found in the groundwater\n and soil gas. See app. at 304a. After Essex conducted\n extensive investigations into the source and levels of\n CVOCs found in the soil gas and groundwater, Essex\n proposed to remediate the areas of the Property\n\f contaminated with CVOCs by means of soil vapor\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n2. \"CVOCs\" is a shorthand reference to those volatile organic compounds\n that Essex used to clean the plant's adhesive-backed paper rolls.\n The CVOCs found on the northeastern and eastern portions of\n the Property include tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, trans-1,2-\n dichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. App. at 237a. Essex discovered\n trace amounts of CVOCs on the eastern and northeast corners of the\n Property in 1985, but the concentrations were so low that at that time\n DEP did not require Essex to address them. See appellees' br. at 19;\n App. at 200a, 237a; SA at 553.\n\n                                5\n\n\n\nextraction (\"SVE\") technology, specifically, a \"dual phase\n extraction system.\" App. at 307a. In May 1992, DEP\n approved this proposal. App. at 307a, 240a.\n\nNotwithstanding DEP's approval of Essex's proposed\n system, Essex did not begin to install and operate the\n system immediately. Rather, from 1992 to 1997, Essex\n continued to investigate the source of the various CVOCs\n found on the Property, and conducted various tests at\n DEP's request. See app. at 238a-40a. This additional\n investigation required Essex to modify the SVE design,\n which requirement might account for the delay in its\n installation. App. at 240a. In any event, Essex completed\n its installation of the dual-phase extraction system in\n August 1997. We note, however, that Essex experienced\n some \"start up\" difficulties at the outset of its operation of\n the system. App. at 240a. Insofar as we can determine from\n the record, Essex is continuing its remediation efforts in\n connection with the CVOCs detected on the Property.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\nAppellants commenced this action in the district court in\n 1997, and filed an amended complaint shortly thereafter.\n The amended complaint sets forth five causes of action\n against appellees Essex and Dow:3 (1) a claim based on a\n breach of Paragraph 16 of the sales contract as a result of\n Essex's failure to complete its cleanup of the Property\n within a \"reasonable time\", (count I);4 (2) a claim based on\n a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair\n dealing based on \"defendants' \" actions in connection with\n their cleanup efforts, (count II); (3) a claim for damages\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of the Comprehensive\n Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act\n (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. S 9607(a)(4)(B), based on appellants'\n alleged expenditure of \"necessary costs of response,\" and\n _________________________________________________________________\n\f3. Inasmuch as the amended complaint refers to Essex and Dow\n collectively as \"defendants\" and asserts allfive claims against each\n entity, we refer to the defendants together as \"appellees\" unless\n otherwise noted.\n\n4. The count does not use the term \"reasonable time\" but appellants\n contend that a reasonable time provision is implicit in the Agreement.\n\n                                6\n\n\n\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief, (count III); (4) a claim\n for contribution for the costs of \"clean-up and removal\" and\n for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to the New\n Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann.\n S 58:10-23.11 et seq. (\"the Spill Act\"), (count IV); and (5) a\n claim for \"damages\" based on appellees' breach of the\n Agreement \"as well as the contamination with respect to the\n subject Property for which defendants are responsible,\"\n (count V). See app. at 67a. Appellees filed an answer to the\n amended complaint and a counterclaim seeking declaratory\n relief that remediation of the Property under Paragraph 16\n of the Agreement included use of \"engineering and\n institutional controls\" and an order requiring appellants to\n consent to them. App. at 80a-81a.\n\nThe parties commenced discovery on November 7, 1997.\n Appellants designated Berger as their Fed. R. Civ. P.\n 30(b)(6) witness to testify on behalf of USLR, USRR and\n Black Horse. On October 2, 1998, appellees' counsel began\n to depose Berger, but counsel was not able to obtain a date\n to reconvene the deposition. As a result of counsels'\n inability to agree on the date that Berger's deposition\n should resume, appellees' counsel sought an order from the\n magistrate judge overseeing discovery to set the date for the\n resumption of the deposition. After a teleconference with\n the parties on October 6, 1998, the magistrate judge signed\n an order dated October, 9, 1998, which provided the\n following:\n\n       IT IS on this 9th day of October, 1998, ORDERED, as\n        follows:\n\n       1. Lawrence S. Berger, as Plaintiffs' Fed. R. Civ. P.\n        30(b)(6) designated witness and fact witness, shall\n        appear for oral deposition commencing on Tuesday,\n        October 13, 1998, at 10:00 a.m. and continuing from\n        day to day thereafter until completed.\n\nApp. at 657a.\n\nNotwithstanding the court's directive, when appellees'\n\f counsel appeared at Berger's law office to continue his\n deposition on October 13, 1998, Berger failed to appear and\n his counsel, Paul Schafhauser, was \"in trial\" and not in the\n\n                                7\n\n\n\noffice. SA at 60-61. At that point, appellees' counsel again\n sought the court's intervention.\n\nOn October 15, 1998, the magistrate judge signed and\n entered an order which directed that Berger's deposition\n recommence on Monday, October 19, 1998, at 10:00 a.m.\n App. at 660a. The order also provided that \"[a]s a sanction\n for failure by Lawrence Berger to appear for depositions on\n Tuesday, October 13, Plaintiffs shall promptly pay the fees\n and costs of counsel fees for defendants (a) for appearing at\n Mr. Berger's non-deposition on October 13, and (b) for\n bringing this application and appearance today.\" App. at\n 660a. While Berger appeared for his deposition at the\n designated date and time, appellees claim that he provided\n evasive and non-responsive answers to many of counsel's\n questions relating to the negotiation and execution of the\n Agreement, and appellants' damages allegations. See\n generally app. at 540a-655a.\n\nAfter the completion of discovery, the parties filed several\n motions germane to this appeal. First, appelleesfiled a\n motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n 56, seeking dismissal of the amended complaint in its\n entirety. Appellants opposed the motion, and filed a cross-\n motion for summary judgment on appellees' counterclaim\n for declaratory relief. In addition, appellees filed a motion\n before the magistrate judge for discovery sanctions\n pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b), (d), seeking to preclude\n appellants \"from asserting, at trial, a position which differs\n from the testimony of their Rule 30(b)(6) witness.\" App. at\n 20a. Appellees also sought reimbursement of the attorney's\n fees and costs associated with Berger's deposition and their\n filing of the second sanctions motion.\n\nThe magistrate judge granted appellees' request for\n sanctions pursuant to Rule 37 by letter opinion and order\n entered June 30, 1999. Relying on Rule 37(b) and (d), he\n agreed that Berger's conduct warranted the sanction\n appellees requested, namely that appellants would be\n precluded from asserting a position and introducing\n evidence contrary to the positions Berger asserted during\n his deposition. The court also concluded that Berger's lack\n of preparedness at his deposition warranted the imposition\n of monetary sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d) in the form of\n\n                                8\n\f costs and attorney's fees associated with taking the\n  deposition and bringing the sanctions motion before the\n  court. App. at 22a. Appellants filed an appeal from the\n  magistrate judge's order to the district court.\n\n In the meantime, after hearing oral argument on the\n  cross-motions for summary judgment on June 28, 1999,\n  see app. at 806a-831a, the district court granted appellees'\n  motion on the amended complaint and denied appellants'\n  cross-motion on the counterclaim by letter opinion and\n  order entered August 10, 1999. Addressing appellees'\n  motion first, the district court determined that dismissal of\n  the amended complaint in its entirety was appropriate for\n  several reasons, each of which we will discuss in greater\n  detail in the discussion that follows.5\n\n With respect to the breach of contract claim (count I), the\n  court held that Paragraph 16 of the Agreement did not\n  contain a provision requiring Essex to remediate the\n  Property in a \"reasonable time,\" and, given the commercial\n  context in which the parties negotiated and executed the\n  Agreement and appellants' subsequent conduct, the court\n  should not imply that the contract had a reasonable time\n  provision. See app. at 10a. Alternatively, it stated that even\n  if it were to assume that there is an implicit \"reasonable\n  time\" provision in Paragraph 16 of the Agreement,\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 5. Before engaging in a substantive analysis of appellants' claims\nagainst\n  Essex, the district court dismissed with prejudice all claims appellants\n  asserted against Dow, reasoning that\n\n           (1) plaintiffs' causes of action arise solely out of plaintiffs'\n            contractual relationship with defendant Essex; (2) Dow and Essex\n            are not related except to the extent that Dow acquired Essex's\n  stock;\n           (3) Essex is a responsible party and not insolvent; and (4) there\n  is\n         not even a scintilla of evidence that would justify piercing\n  Essex's\n         corporate veil.\n\n App. at 7a n.1. Appellants assert that the district court erred in\n  dismissing outright the claims against Dow, claiming that there are\n  factual issues concerning whether it is a proper party in this suit. We\n  will affirm the court's dismissal of Dow without further discussion as\n  appellants' argument clearly is without merit. In any event, our\n  affirmance of the summary judgment for Essex means that Dow cannot\n  be liable to appellants.\n\f                                9\n\n\n\nappellants failed to adduce any evidence from which a\n reasonable jury could conclude that 14 years, i.e., from\n 1985 to the date of the district court's decision, was an\n unreasonably long time period to complete the type of\n detoxification and remediation called for in the Clean-Up\n Plan. App. at 11a. Turning next to appellants' claim based\n on the alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith\n and fair dealing (count II), the court found that appellants\n failed to produce sufficient evidence that Essex acted in bad\n faith or engaged in misconduct that caused the delay in\n completing the cleanup of the Property. App. at 13a.\n\nThird, the court dismissed the CERCLA and Spill Act\n claims for damages on the ground that appellants could not\n demonstrate that they incurred any compensable costs\n under either statute. The court pointed out that the only\n costs that appellants allegedly incurred were the fees they\n paid to their consultant, Enviro-Sciences, Inc. (\"ESI\"), but\n that such fees were not compensable under either the\n CERCLA or the Spill Act. App. at 15a. The court also denied\n appellants' request for injunctive and declaratory relief\n under CERCLA and the Spill Act, reasoning that\n declaratory relief was inappropriate because \"plaintiffs have\n utterly failed to make any showing that they are likely to\n incur any future costs that will be recoverable\" under either\n statute. It further found that injunctive relief was not\n warranted in view of the circumstance that Essex\"is\n contractually and statutorily bound to detoxify the\n Property,\" and there was no evidence that Essex had\n breached the contract or violated CERCLA or the Spill Act.\n App. at 15a-16a. Next, the court dismissed count V, stating\n that \"because plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient\n evidence in support of their breach of contract claims, they\n cannot recover the damages outlined in Count Five of the\n Complaint.\" App. at 16a.\n\nFinally, the district court addressed and denied\n appellants' cross-motion for summary judgment on the\n counterclaim, noting that appellants \"cite no authority in\n support of their motion,\" but \"merely allege that `Plaintiffs\n do not and need not consent to any [engineering and\n institutional controls] with respect to the Property.' \"\n Ultimately the court found that \"[o]n the present record,\n\n                                10\n\n\n\nthis Court is unable to say that the plaintiffs are entitled,\n as a matter of law, to a judgment dismissing defendants'\n\f  counterclaims.\"6 App. at 17a. The court's order stated that\n  appellants' amended complaint was dismissed with\n  prejudice.\n\n After the district court ruled on the parties' dispositive\n  motions, on or about August 13, 1999, the district court\n  ordered the parties to file cross-motions with respect to\n  Essex's counterclaim. App. at 775a. On December 13,\n  1999, the district court heard oral argument on the cross-\n  motions, and also considered appellants' outstanding\n  appeal from the magistrate judge's sanctions order. Ruling\n  on the outstanding motions the district court (1) affirmed\n  the magistrate judge's sanctions order, and (2) dismissed\n  Essex's counterclaim against appellants without prejudice\n  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the\n  controversy set forth in the counterclaim was not ripe. See\n  app. at 832a-49a. The district court then memorialized its\n  record rulings in its \"Final Order\" entered December 16,\n  1999. App. at 23a. The monetary sanctions have been\n  quantified and we understand that appellants have paid\n  them.\n\n Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal to this court\n  from the district court's orders of August 10, 1999, and\n  December 16, 1999. App. at 34a. The appellees do not\n  cross-appeal from the dismissal of their counterclaim. We\n  have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291.7 Of course,\n  the fact that the dismissal of the counterclaim was without\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 6. The court also addressed and denied appellees' motion for sanctions\n  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. That aspect of the court's ruling is not\n  in issue in this appeal, and we need not address it any further.\n\n 7. The district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n28\n   U.S.C. S 1331 inasmuch as count III of the amended complaint asserted\n   a claim pursuant to CERCLA. The district court exercised supplemental\n   jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n   S 1367. We exercise plenary review over the district court's dismissal\nof\n   appellants' amended complaint and the counterclaim, see Nelson v.\n   Upsala College, 51 F.3d 383, 385 (3d Cir. 1995), and review the court's\n   disposition of the sanctions issue pursuant to Rule 37 for an abuse of\n   discretion.

DISCUSSION\n\nAs is evident from our recitation of the procedural history\n leading to this appeal, appellants challenge several of the\n district court's rulings made during the proceedings in this\n matter. First, we will address the court's August 10, 1999\n order dismissing the amended complaint. Then, we will\n review the district court's December 16, 1999 order\n dismissing appellees' counterclaim without prejudice, and\n affirming the magistrate judge's sanctions order.\n\nA. District Court's Dismissal of\n        the Amended Complaint\n\n1. Breach of Contract Claim (Count I)\n\nAppellants focus most of their attention on the district\n court's dismissal of their breach of contract claim pleaded\n in count I of the amended complaint. While recognizing that\n under New Jersey law, courts generally find that there is a\n \"reasonable time\" term implicit in contracts that do not set\n forth any time limitation for performance, the district court\n nevertheless held that \"[i]n this case, the Court finds no\n justification for implying a `reasonable time' for\n performance because such a term is not `necessary to give\n business efficacy to the contract as written.' \" App. at 8a.\n The court explained that \"[a] main purpose of the\n Agreement, and the only purpose of Paragraph 16, was to\n require Essex to remediate the Property to the full\n satisfaction of the DEP and thereby make the land freely\n marketable.\" App. at 8a. The court found that\"a\n `reasonable time' limitation is not necessary because\n Essex's performance under the contract--obtainingfinal\n DEP approval--must be evaluated solely by reference to the\n DEP.\" App. at 9a. Accordingly, the court stated that \"such\n a contract simply does not lend itself to a reasonable time\n limitation.\" Id.\n\n                                   12\n\n\n\nIt also dismissed the breach of contract claim on the\n alternative ground that appellants presented insufficient\n evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that\n Essex breached its obligation to perform remediation and\n obtain DEP approval pursuant to the Clean-Up Plan within\n a \"reasonable time.\" On this point, the district court held as\n follows:\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that Essex has breached its contractual\n\f       obligation to complete the detoxification and obtain\n       final DEP approval `within a reasonable time.'\n       Therefore, to prevail, plaintiffs must show that a\n       `reasonable time' has already expired. The Agreement\n       was executed in 1985. This Court cannot say that\n       fourteen years is unreasonable as a matter of law. In\n       the context of an ISRA clean-up, which plaintiff Berger\n       understood to be a `cumbersome' and `long' process,\n       plaintiffs must adduce evidence that a `reasonable time'\n       for completion of the clean-up is less then fourteen\n       years. . . .\n\n       Such evidence might be in the form of reprimands or\n       other statements from regulatory agencies like the\n       DEP. Plaintiffs might also carry their evidentiary\n       burden with expert testimony that, under the\n       circumstances of this site and comparing it to other\n       sites, fourteen years is an unreasonable length of time.\n       In this case, however, plaintiffs have simply failed to\n       adduce any evidence that fourteen years is\n       unreasonable. The only evidence that even remotely\n       addresses this issue is contained in plaintiffs' expert\n       report. . . .\n\n       Giving plaintiffs the best of Mr. Cohen's report, `the\n       environmental program undertaken on this site has\n       been slow and ineffective in treating the contaminants\n       that were release by Essex Chemical.' But evidence of\n       a slow and ineffective clean-up process, without more,\n       cannot reasonably support an inference that fourteen\n       years is unreasonable.\n\nApp. at 11a-12a.\n\nAppellants contend that the court erred in dismissing\n their breach of contract claim because, notwithstanding the\n\n                                13\n\n\n\nabsence in Paragraph 16 of the Agreement of an explicit\n date by which Essex was to complete its cleanup of the\n Property and obtain DEP approval, by implication the\n Agreement requires Essex to fulfill its contractual\n obligations within a reasonable time. Appellants rely on the\n well-established principle of New Jersey law, which is\n applicable here on the contractual issues, that\" `[w]here no\n time is fixed for the performance of a contract, by\n implication a reasonable time was intended.' \" Br. at 41\n (quoting, inter alia, Becker v. Sunrise at Elkridge, 543 A.2d\n 977, 983 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1988)). They claim that\n the district court erred in concluding that the nature of this\n particular contract, and Essex's obligation with respect to\n\f the remediation of the Property, rendered a \"reasonable\n time\" limitation unreasonable in the circumstances.\n Alternatively, they assert that at a minimum, there was a\n genuine issue of material fact as to whether the parties\n intended that Essex complete its remediation obligations\n within a reasonable time, thus precluding summary\n judgment in appellees' favor. Second, appellants contend\n that contrary to the district court's finding, they presented\n sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n conclude that Essex failed to remediate the Property within\n a \"reasonable time.\"\n\nAppellees respond that the district court correctly\n dismissed the breach of contract claim because appellants\n base their argument on the incorrect premise that\n Paragraph 16 omits a contractual provision which in turn\n requires the court to supply a \"reasonable time\" limitation.\n Br. at 36. They claim that contrary to appellants'\n construction of the contract, Paragraph 16 does contain a\n definite term for completion of the Property's remediation\n and therefore does not omit a contractual provision. In\n appellees' view the contract unambiguously provides the\n only term for completion that is reasonable in the\n circumstances--namely, that Essex's obligation is satisfied\n if the detoxification is undertaken \"in accordance with and\n to the approval of DEP.\" Br. at 35-36. They claim that the\n district court correctly determined that it would be\n unreasonable to find that the Agreement included an\n implied reasonable time limitation, given the commercial\n context of the sale and purchase.\n\n                                14\n\n\n\nAppellees further assert that, in any event, even if we\n agreed with appellants that the district court should have\n implied a \"reasonable time\" limitation on Essex's\n remediation obligations pursuant to Paragraph 16,\n summary judgment was appropriate because there is no\n evidence that Essex breached its contractual obligations in\n that connection. They claim that the district court correctly\n determined that appellants failed to meet their burden of\n producing evidence demonstrating that as of the date that\n appellants filed their complaint in the district court, Essex\n had failed to remediate and detoxify the Property in\n accordance with the Clean-Up Plan, and obtain DEP\n approval of its efforts, within a reasonable time.\n\nAppellees' protestations notwithstanding, we reject the\n district court's conclusion that a reasonable time provision\n was not implicit in Paragraph 16 of the Agreement. After\n all, New Jersey courts uniformly have applied the principle\n that \"where no time is fixed for the performance of a\n\f contract, by implication a reasonable time was intended.\"\n See Becker, 543 A.2d at 983 (contract for sale of real\n property); see also, e.g., River Dev. Corp. v. Liberty Corp.,\n 148 A.2d 721, 722 (N.J. 1959) (license to reclaim land must\n be exercised within a reasonable time); Ridge Chevrolet-\n Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Scarano, 569 A.2d 296, 300 (N.J. Super.\n Ct. App. Div. 1990) (performance under real estate\n contract); Mazzeo v. Kartman, 560 A.2d 733, 737 (N.J.\n Super. Ct. App. Div. 1989) (\"If the trial judge cannot\n determine the parties' actual intent [concerning the\n temporal limits of a right of first refusal], he should\n determine a `reasonable time' for the expiration of the\n right.\"); Ocean Cape Hotel Corp. v. Masefield Corp., 164\n A.2d 607, 614 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1960) (where\n plaintiff claimed that defendant was obligated to make\n certain repairs to property, if plaintiff 's claim had been\n based on breach of contract, the court would have implied\n a term that required completion of performance within a\n reasonable time and would not have permitted parol\n evidence that defendant promised repairs as of a certain\n fixed date); McGraw v. Johnson, 126 A.2d 203, 206 (N.J.\n Super. Ct. App. Div. 1956) (noting that performance under\n contract must be completed within reasonable time where\n claim was based on contractor's alleged failure to complete\n\n                               15\n\n\n\nbuilding of home within a reasonable time); Curtis Elevator\n Co. v. Hampshire House, Inc., 362 A.2d 73, 76 (N.J. Super.\n Ct. Law Div. 1976) (performance under contract to install\n elevators; where no specific date for completion was\n provided in contract, court implied term requiring\n completion within a reasonable time).\n\nThe district court predicated its analysis on statements in\n New Jersey cases to the effect that terms are implied to\n \"give business efficacy to the contract as written.\" See app.\n at 8a (citing McGarry v. Saint Anthony of Padua Roman\n Catholic Church, 704 A.2d 1353, 1357 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\n Div. 1998)). But appellants argue persuasively that it would\n be commercially unreasonable to construe the terms of\n Paragraph 16 so as to permit Essex to begin its cleanup at\n its leisure, and to continue its efforts in perpetuity without\n the threat or even the slightest possibility of adverse legal\n consequences flowing from inordinate delay. We also doubt\n that the parties could have intended such a bizarre result.\n See Onderdonk v. The Presbyterian Homes of N.J., 425 A.2d\n 1057, 1063 (N.J. 1981) (\"Central to this inquiry of\n ascertaining what, if any, terms are implied is the intent of\n the parties. Intent may be determined by examination of\n the contract and in particular the setting in which it was\n executed.\").\n\fNevertheless, notwithstanding our holding that a\n \"reasonable time\" term is implicit is Paragraph 16 of the\n Agreement, we agree with the district court's alternative\n basis for dismissing appellants' breach of contract claim,\n i.e., that a reasonable time period has not expired.8 We are\n mindful that \"[w]hat constitutes a reasonable time under\n New Jersey law `is usually an implication of fact, and not of\n law, derivable from the language used by the parties\n considered in the context of the subject matter and the\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n8. In view of our result appellees should understand that they do not\n have forever to complete the remediation and detoxification. To the\n contrary, they must diligently pursue their efforts to obtain the DEP\n approval within a reasonable time. Of course, it is not our intention by\n making this point to invite further litigation. We believe that if\n appellees\n are diligent in these efforts and keep appellants advised of the steps\n they\n are taking that the parties should be able to avoid additional judicial\n proceedings.\n\n                                16\n\n\n\nattendant circumstances, in aid of the apparent intention.' \"\n Mazzeo, 560 A.2d at 737 (quoting Borough of West Caldwell\n v. Borough of Caldwell, 138 A.2d 402, 412 (N.J. 1958)).\n Nevertheless, appellants would bear the burden of proof on\n this issue at trial, to show that a reasonable time has\n expired, and to survive summary judgment, they must\n adduce evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n conclude that Essex breached its contractual obligation to\n complete its remediation and detoxification efforts within a\n reasonable time. Here, even viewing the facts in the light\n most favorable to appellants, we agree with the district\n court's assessment of the weakness of appellants' evidence\n as well as the court's conclusion that appellants failed to\n demonstrate that there was a genuine issue of material fact\n on the issue of whether Essex had breached its obligation\n to remediate the Property and obtain DEP approval within\n a reasonable time. Simply put, the record does not support\n the conclusion that appellants posit, i.e., that Essex\n breached its contractual duties to complete the remediation\n and detoxification efforts within a reasonable time.\n\nFor example, appellants first point to an Essex\"Expense\n Appropriation Request\" which indicated that the\n \"completion date\" of the entire project would be \"1987.\"9\n App. at 777a. But we do not share appellants' view that\n this evidence can support a conclusion that Essex breached\n Paragraph 16 of the Agreement. Obviously, the fact that\n\f Essex estimated its completion date incorrectly does not\n support the conclusion that it has failed to cleanup the\n Property within a reasonable time. While a party's advance\n estimate of the time to complete a project might be\n persuasive evidence of the reasonable time for that\n undertaking, it is not in the circumstances here in which\n the scope of the project was so uncertain.\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n9. According to the deposition testimony of Irwin Zonis, Essex's Chief\n Environmental Officer who was involved in the remediation and\n detoxification of the Property, the purpose of the Expense Appropriation\n Request was to notify Essex's financial department of the amount of\n funds deemed necessary for the completion of the project. He further\n explained that the document \"told the financial department that the\n $320,000 would be expended by the end of 1987.\" App. at 189a.\n\n                                17\n\n\n\nAppellants also rely on the fact that in March 1986,\n shortly after the DEP approved Essex's Clean-Up Plan, Dr.\n Calvin J. Benning (\"Benning\"), Director of Environmental\n Affairs for Essex, wrote to the DEP questioning whether\n certain of the standards set forth in the Clean-Up Plan with\n respect to the contemplated soil remediation and whether\n the Clean-Up Plan's requirements were reasonable in the\n circumstances. App. at 225a-26a. For convenience, we will\n refer to this correspondence as Essex's \"March 1986 letter.\"\n Appellants claim that the March 1986 letter was Essex's\n \"attempt[ ] to circumvent the parameters and conditions\" of\n its Clean-Up Plan, and that it demonstrates that Essex\n failed to proceed \"reasonably and diligently\" with the\n Property's detoxification. Br. at 46.\n\nWe cannot agree. The March 1986 letter questions the\n cleanup levels relating to the soil remediation which Essex\n completed within two years of the sale of the Property. See\n generally app. at 235a; appellees' br. at 17. Certainly if\n Essex also had completed the groundwater remediation\n within that period appellants would not have instituted\n litigation alleging a breach of Paragraph 16. Thus,\n inasmuch as appellants' breach of contract claim\n essentially is predicated on Essex's failure to complete\n groundwater remediation, we fail to see how this letter\n supports appellants' argument.\n\nSimilarly, appellants cite the fact that Essex did not\n begin groundwater remediation efforts until 1988 or\n remediation of the CVOCs until 1997. See br. at 47-48.\n However, appellants do not present evidence indicating that\n the delays were avoidable, and in any event, were\n unreasonable. Also they rely on the circumstance that\n\f groundwater pumping \"was frequently interrupted\n throughout the years,\" br. at 47, and that the DEP gave\n Essex a rating of \"unacceptable due to `failure to operate the\n groundwater remediation system in the capacity it was\n designed.' \" App. at 298a (emphasis added). But a review of\n the evidence in the record confirms that the interruptions\n Essex experienced are not a basis for holding that it\n unreasonably delayed its performance under Paragraph 16.\n To the contrary, intermittent delays are to be expected on\n a remediation project which cannot be compared to an\n\n                               18\n\n\n\nordinary construction project built in accordance with fixed\n plans which is thus far less likely to encounter problems\n than a remediation undertaking. Moreover, as appellees\n correctly point out, the DEP's \"unacceptable\" rating did not\n relate to the length of time that Essex had expended on the\n remediation and detoxification of the Property. Rather, the\n DEP comments related to the need for Essex to implement\n a sufficient maintenance program so that it could manage\n the problems it had been experiencing with the wells more\n efficiently in the future. See app. at 298a. Thus, we cannot\n view the DEP's comments as tantamount to a statement\n that Essex was taking too long to finish the Property\n cleanup.\n\nAs the district court correctly observed, app. at 11a-12a,\n appellants' strongest evidence on this score is a statement\n by their environmental consultant, Irving Cohen of ESI.\n Cohen issued a report in which he opined that \"the\n environmental program undertaken on this site has been\n slow and ineffective in treating the contaminants that were\n released by Essex Chemical.\" App. at 418a. In our view,\n however, this statement does not create a factual issue for\n the jury on the issue of unreasonable delay. Importantly,\n Cohen stops short of stating definitively that, given the\n circumstances, Essex had taken too long to complete its\n remediation and detoxification efforts. Moreover, even if he\n had stated such a conclusion it would not have an\n adequate foundation as he does not analyze specifically the\n types of contaminants involved in this project and the\n circumstances surrounding the remediation of this site. Nor\n does he compare Essex's efforts to other sites plagued with\n similar environmental contaminants. Given the vague\n nature of Cohen's conclusion, we agree with the district\n court's observation that \"evidence of a slow and ineffective\n cleanup process, without more, cannot reasonably support\n an inference that fourteen years is unreasonable.\" App. at\n 12a.\n\nWhen boiled down to its essence, appellants' argument is\n\f that because the cleanup of the Property has taken longer\n to finish than the parties originally anticipated, Essex has\n breached Paragraph 16 of the Agreement as it has not\n completed the cleanup within a \"reasonable time.\" While it\n\n                                19\n\n\n\nmay be unfortunate that it has taken Essex an extended\n period of time to complete the cleanup of this Property, the\n delay does not support a conclusion that the amount of\n time it already has spent is unreasonable given the nature\n of Essex's contractual obligation. By appellants' own\n admission, the remediation and detoxification of the\n Property is a large effort which, by its very nature, is a\n lengthy and time-consuming process. Given the realities of\n the situation, appellants simply have failed to point to any\n evidence in this record demonstrating that the length of\n time that Essex has taken to detoxify the Property and\n obtain DEP approval is unreasonable in the circumstances.\n Accordingly, we will affirm the district court's dismissal the\n breach of contract claim.\n\n2. Breach of the Implied Duty of Good Faith\n        and Fair Dealing (Count II)\n\nThe district court also dismissed appellants' claim based\n on Essex's alleged breach of the implied duty of good faith\n and fair dealing, reasoning:\n\n       In this case, plaintiffs allege only that Essex has failed\n        to complete the clean-up process and obtain final DEP\n        approval within a reasonable time. They point to no\n        acts or omissions done in bad faith. There is no\n        allegation, and certainly no evidence, that Essex has\n        committed any misconduct. Summary judgment is\n        therefore appropriate.\n\nApp. at 13a. Appellants claim that the district court erred\n in granting summary judgment on this claim because it\n ignored evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n conclude that Essex breached the implied duty of good faith\n and fair dealing during the course of its cleanup of the\n Property. Appellants point to the following evidence in\n support of their claim: (1) documents confirming that\n appellees \"attempted to renege upon the standards set forth\n in the Clean-Up Plan\"; (2) evidence showing that appellees\n \"inexplicably failed to even begin remediation for many\n years after delineating contamination on the Property\"; and\n (3) DEP documents reprimanding Essex for \" `violations' and\n `unacceptable' progress.\" Br. at 49.\n\n                                20\n\fTo be sure, \"every contract in New Jersey contains an\n implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\" Sons of\n Thunder, Inc. v. Borden, Inc., 690 A.2d 575, 587 (N.J.\n 1997); see also Restatement (Second) of Contracts S 205\n (1981) (\"Every contract imposes upon each party a duty of\n good faith and fair dealing in its performance and its\n enforcement.\"). \"The implied covenant is an independent\n duty and may be breached even where there is no breach\n of the contract's express terms.\" Emerson Radio Corp. v.\n Orion Sales, Inc., 80 F. Supp.2d 307, 311 (D.N.J. 2000)\n (citing, inter alia, Sons of Thunder, Inc., 690 A.2d at 575);\n see also Bak-a-Lum Corp. v. Alcoa Bldg. Prods., Inc. , 351\n A.2d 349, 352 (N.J. 1976).\n\nThe implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\n requires that \"neither party shall do anything which will\n have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the\n other party to receive the fruits of the contract.\" Sons of\n Thunder, Inc., 690 A.2d at 587 (internal quotation marks\n omitted); Palisades Properties, Inc. v. Brunetti , 207 A.2d\n 522, 531 (N.J. 1965). A party to a contract breaches the\n covenant if it acts in bad faith or engages in some other\n form of inequitable conduct in the performance of a\n contractual obligation. See, e.g., Sons of Thunder, Inc., 690\n A.2d at 589 (distinguishing prior decision in Karl's Sales &\n Service, Inc. v Gimbel Bros. Inc., 592 A.2d 647 (N.J. Super.\n Ct. App. Div. 1991), in which \"there were no allegations of\n bad faith or dishonesty on the part of the terminating\n party\" to the contract); Association Group Life, Inc. v.\n Catholic War Veterans, 293 A.2d 382, 384 (N.J. 1972)\n (stating that a contracting party breaches duty of good faith\n and fair dealing by engaging in behavior that was\"not\n contemplated by the spirit of the contract and fell short of\n fair dealing\"); Emerson Radio Corp., 80 F. Supp.2d at 311\n (\"The Restatement and the [New Jersey] cases note a state\n of mind or malice-like element to breach of good faith and\n fair dealing, holding that the duty excludes activity that is\n unfair, not decent or reasonable, nor dishonest.\"); Kapossy\n v.

But the obligation goes further:\n         bad faith may be overt or may consist of inaction, and\n         fair dealing may require more than honesty. A complete\n         catalogue of types of bad faith is impossible, but the\n         following types are among those which have been\n         recognized in judicial decisions: evasion of the spirit of\n         the bargain, lack of diligence and slacking off , willful\n         rendering of imperfect performance, abuse of power to\n         specify terms, and interference with or failure to\n         cooperate in the other party's performance.\n\n Id.

Quite coincidentally this very panel on the same day that it heard\n  argument in this case also heard argument in a case under Pennsylvania\n  law involving the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing.

Plainly, New Jersey law\n  imposes a broader obligation on a party to a contract than Pennsylvania\n  law to act in good faith in its performance. The parties, however, do\nnot\n  dispute that New Jersey law applies in this case, and we will decide the\n  case on that basis.\n\n                                 22\n\n\n\n performance of its obligation to remediate the Property and\n  obtain DEP in accordance with Paragraph 16 of the\n  Agreement. They claim that since the DEP approved the\n  Clean-Up Plan in 1985, Essex has not performed its\n  cleanup in a diligent manner, and in fact, has engaged in\n\f bad faith conduct purposely to protract the process.\n According to appellants, Essex's conduct has precluded\n them from obtaining the fruits of their contract, i.e., a\n property that is not environmentally distressed.\n\nWe cannot agree that the evidence in this case supports\n the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on the\n issue of Essex's good faith in its performance of its\n obligation to remediate and detoxify the Property. In reality,\n appellants' argument rests exclusively on their subjective\n interpretation of the March 1986 letter in which Benning\n set forth the following reservations as to whether certain\n aspects of the Clean-Up Plan were reasonable in the\n circumstances:\n\n       The clean-up plan calls for the excavation and disposal\n        of the contaminated soil to a level of 1 ppm, . . . based\n        on the requirements of the case manager at BISE. I\n        believe these levels are extremely low and not\n        warranted. . . . We fully intend to remove the\n        contaminated dirt from the former tank farm area. . . .\n        However to satisfy BISE we are required to perform 15\n        separate sample analyses in the laboratory instead of\n        using a portable field analyzer to determine the extent\n        of pollution and excavation, and to excavate to 1 ppm\n        residual total VOC in the soil. I believe these\n        requirements are both unreasonable and unwarranted.\n        The clean up plan had to be approved by the end of\n        1985 and time was not available to question the\n        requirement or to rationally discuss these points.\n        However, the IAG discussion [which Benning attended\n        on March 18, 1986] indicate [sic] that the[DEP] has\n        also been rethinking some of their procedures and\n        actions. I believe hexane and heptane are classified as\n        hydrocarbon and I believe that a higher level than 1\n        ppm is perfectly justified.\n\nApp. at 225a-26a. Appellants claim that this letter exhibits\n Essex's lack of good faith and confirms that Essex\n\n                                23\n\n\n\nattempted to \"renege upon the standards set forth in the\n Cleanup Plan.\" Br. at 49; reply br. at 22-23.\n\nWhile the letter questions whether the cleanup level of 1\n ppm is warranted and whether lab analysis of soil samples\n is necessary as opposed to Essex merely conductingfield\n measurements of the soil, the letter does not demonstrate\n a lack of good faith on Essex's part in performing its\n obligations pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the Agreement.\n First, as we previously mentioned, the letter discusses\n\f Essex's obligations under the Clean-Up Plan relating to soil\n remediation, but appellants do not dispute that Essex has\n completed its soil remediation and detoxification efforts. In\n fact, appellants confirmed that Essex began its cleanup of\n the soil shortly after the sale, and that it completed soil\n remediation sometime within two years. Thus, we fail to see\n how this letter can demonstrate Essex's lack of diligence in\n that regard, or how Essex's conduct in questioning certain\n aspects of the Clean-Up Plan compromised appellants' right\n \"to receive the fruits of the contract.\" See Sons of Thunder,\n Inc., 690 A.2d at 587 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nMoreover, and perhaps more importantly, Benning wrote\n the March 1986 letter after he met with DEP officials and\n discussed the topic of appropriate cleanup levels in soil.\n The letter specifically states that the \"IAG discussion on\n March 18 indicate [sic] that the department has also been\n rethinking some of their procedures and actions.\" App. at\n 225a. Thus, while the letter questioned the reasonableness\n of certain aspects of the Clean-Up Plan, Benning's\n comments indicate that he did so because of his previous\n discussions with DEP officials which apparently led him to\n believe that the DEP might no longer view some of its\n requirements as necessary or appropriate. Thus, when\n viewed in context, the letter does not indicate that Essex\n intended to renege on its obligation to cleanup the Property,\n and it does not indicate that Essex performed its\n contractual obligations with a lack of good faith.\n\nIn any event, Benning's concern over certain aspects of\n the Clean-Up Plan is of no consequence when we consider\n that less than two months later, he wrote a memorandum\n to Essex officials in which he recognized and re-emphasized\n\n                                24\n\n\n\nEssex's obligation to adhere to the requirements set forth in\n Clean-Up Plan. The memorandum states:\n\n       Lately we have received letters from NJDEP and have\n        discussed our program and permit applications with\n        both state and local officials. These discussions have\n        led to some very specific program requirements and\n        items we must `keep in mind.'\n\n       For example:\n\n       1. The NJDEP's ECRA office and the department of\n        solid waste management have made it very clear\n        that we must adhere to the Clean Up Plan .\n\nApp. at 227a.\n\fSimply put, the fact that Benning questioned certain\n aspects of the Clean-Up Plan is not evidence that Essex\n acted in bad faith, as the DEP obviously responded to\n Benning's concerns by indicating that Essex was obligated\n to remediate the Property in accordance with the Clean-Up\n Plan, and Benning expressly reaffirmed Essex's intent to\n comply with its contractual and statutory obligations in\n that regard. Moreover, appellants do not demonstrate that\n Essex ever failed to implement a substantive remediation\n measure that the DEP required in connection with Essex's\n cleanup of the Property, and do not dispute that Essex\n completed soil remediation on the Property within two years\n of the sale. In our view, Benning's May 1986 memorandum\n reaffirming Essex's commitment to remediate the Property\n in accordance with the Clean-Up Plan belies appellants'\n assertion that the March 1986 letter evidences Essex's\n intent from the outset to conduct its remediation and\n detoxification efforts in \"bad faith.\" Reply br. at 23. In the\n circumstances, we will affirm the district court's dismissal\n of appellants' claim that Essex breached the duty of good\n faith and fair dealing.\n\n3. Appellants' CERCLA Claim (Count III)\n        and Spill Act Claim (Count IV)\n\nCount III of the amended complaint asserts a claim for\n damages and injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to\n CERCLA, and count IV seeks the same relief pursuant to\n\n                                25\n\n\n\nthe Spill Act. As previously mentioned, the district court\n dismissed the CERCLA claim, reasoning that appellants\n had not incurred any compensable \"necessary costs of\n response\" pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA. See\n 42 U.S.C. S 9607(a)(4)(B). In particular, the court explained\n that the only costs that appellants claimed to have incurred\n were the fees they paid to their environmental consultant,\n ESI. The district court found that those fees were not\n recoverable under CERCLA \"because they had nothing to\n do with any effort by plaintiffs to detoxify the Property or to\n prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances.\"\n App. at 14a (emphasis added). The district court explained\n that the fees were not recoverable because ESI merely\n reviewed the quarterly reports that Essex submitted to\n appellants and the DEP; ESI never visited the Property,\n monitored the contamination or the cleanup of the\n Property, or gathered data related to the investigation or\n remediation of the Property. The district court stated that\n \"ESI's fees are those of an ordinary expert witness: the fees\n represent litigation costs, not environmental monitoring\n\f  costs.\" App. at 15a. Similarly, the court dismissed\n  appellants' Spill Act claim seeking to recover ESI's fees\n  because the fees \"are unrelated to any prevention,\n  mitigation, or remediation of contamination on the\n  Property.\" App. at 14a.\n\n The district court also denied appellants' request for a\n  declaration that Essex is liable to appellants for any future\n  costs pursuant to CERCLA or the Spill Act. The court\n  stated that \"[p]laintiffs have utterly failed to make any\n  showing that they are likely to incur any future costs that\n  will be recoverable under CERCLA or the Spill Act. Indeed,\n  it is undisputed that Essex is contractually obligated to\n  remediate the Property at its own expense.\" App. at 15a.\n  Inasmuch as there was \"no evidence--or even an allegation\n  --that the plaintiffs intend to participate in future clean-up\n  activities or incur any costs that might be recoverable\n  under CERCLA,\" the court concluded that granting\n  declaratory relief would be inappropriate.\n\n Finally, the court denied appellants' request for an\n  injunction compelling Essex to commence and complete the\n  cleanup on the basis that there was no present case or\n\n                                 26\n\n\n\n controversy. The court reasoned that \"[t]here is no dispute\n  that Essex is under both a contractual and statutory duty\n  to detoxify the Property; nor is there any dispute that Essex\n  has worked continuously to remediate the Property.\" The\n  court further explained that \"[i]n the absence of evidence\n  that Essex has breached the Agreement or violated CERCLA\n  or IRSA, there is no basis for the injunction that plaintiffs\n  seek.\" App. at 16a.\n\n On appeal from the CERCLA and Spill Act dispositions,\n  appellants primarily claim that the district court erred in\n  dismissing their CERCLA claim for monetary relief. 11 While\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 11. We will address only briefly the several other issues appellants\nraise\n  in connection with their CERCLA and Spill Act claims pleaded in counts\n  III and IV of the amended complaint. Specifically, appellants maintain\n  that the district court erred in rejecting their request for injunctive\n  and\n  declaratory relief pursuant to CERCLA, and in dismissing count IV of the\n  amended complaint, their Spill Act claim. First, appellants contend that\n  they are entitled to declaratory relief under CERCLA even if they have\n  not incurred any compensable response costs as of yet, \"[p]articularly\n  [because] in light of the inexplicable lack of progress by Defendants in\n  detoxifying the Property to date, Plaintiffs may well be forced to incur\n\f  future response costs to complete [the] detoxification. . . .\" Br. at 52\n  (citing Bowen Eng'g v. Estate of Reeve, 799 F. Supp. 467, 476 (D.N.J.\n  1992), aff 'd, 19 F.3d 642 (3d Cir. 1994) (table)). They also state\n  generally that injunctive relief pursuant to CERCLA is appropriate in\nthe\n  circumstances, but fail to explain the reason for their position on that\n  point. See id.\n\n We reject appellants' arguments in their entirety. First, appellants have\n  not presented any evidence with respect to their request for a\ndeclaratory\n  judgment as to future response costs under CERCLA demonstrating that\n  such relief is appropriate. Given our discussion in the text that\nfollows,\n  it is clear that appellants have not incurred any response costs to\ndate,\n  and it is undisputed that Essex, rather than appellants, is bound\n  contractually to complete the cleanup of the Property and obtain final\n  DEP approval. Thus, there is nothing in the record suggesting that\n  appellants ever will incur response costs, and there is no potential for\n  injury that is \"sufficiently immediate and real\" so as to warrant\n  declaratory relief pursuant to section 113(g)(2) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C.\n  S 9613(g)(2). See Kelley v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., 17 F.3d 836,\n  845 (6th Cir. 1994) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also United\n  States v. USX Corp., 68 F.3d 811, 819 (3d Cir. 1995) (quoting statement\n  in Kelly, 17 F.3d at 844, that \" `[i]n providing for the recovery of\n  response\n\n                                 27\n\n\n\n appellants have not set forth their CERCLA argument in\n  any detail, we understand they predicate it on a belief that\n  they are entitled to recover the amounts paid to appellants'\n  environmental consultant, ESI, as \"necessary costs of\n  response\" pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA, because\n  those \"oversight costs\" fall within the scope of either\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n costs, Congress included language [in section 113(g)(2)] to insure that a\n  responsible party's liability [for response costs], once established,\n  would\n  not have to be relitigated. . . .' \") (emphasis added)); The Southland\n  Corp.\n  v. Ashland Oil, Inc., 696 F. Supp. 994, 999 (D.N.J. 1988) (\"To be\ngranted\n  a declaratory judgment on the issue of liability, . . . plaintiff[ ]\nmust\n  establish four factors to satisfy the requirements of section 107(a),\"\n  including \"that, as a result [of defendants' conduct], [plaintiff] has\n  incurred response costs.\"); compare Bowen Eng'g, 799 F. Supp. at 476\n  (stating that \"[O]nce some expenditure [for response costs] has been\n\f     made, the controversy is sufficiently real to permit the court to issue\na\n  declaratory judgment on defendant's liability.\") (internal quotation\nmarks\n  omitted). Second, appellants' vague assertion that injunctive relief is\n  appropriate in this case, without any further elaboration on that point,\n  is unconvincing.\n\n Finally, we agree with the district court's disposition of the Spill Act\n   claim seeking both monetary and equitable relief. While we have\n   considered appellants' argument on this score, which essentially\nconsists\n   only of a citation to T&E Industries, Inc. v. Safety Light Corp., 587\nA.2d\n   1249 (N.J. 1991), we fail to see how the case is germane here because\n   it did not present claims under the Spill Act. In any event, after\n   reviewing the applicable statutory provisions and case law on point, we\n   are convinced that the district court did not err in dismissing count\nIV.\n   Accordingly, we will affirm the court's dismissal of the Spill Act claim\n   without further discussion. See N.J. Stat. Ann. S 58:10-23.11b.d.\n   (providing definition of \"cleanup and removal costs\" for purposes of\nSpill\n   Act); id. S 58:10-23.11g.c.(1) (stating that responsible persons are\n   \"strictly liable, jointly and severally, without regard to fault, for\nall\n   cleanup and removal costs no matter by whom incurred\") (emphasis\n   added); compare Analytical Measurements, Inc. v. The Keuffel & Esser\n   Co., 843 F. Supp. 920, 929-30 (D.N.J. 1993) (stating that costs of the\n   initial soil and groundwater investigation, analysis of problems and\n   alternatives, excavation of soil, removal of thefirst 600 tons of soil\nto\n   Ohio, and design of a groundwater investigation plan were \"clearly\n   recoverable under the Spill Act since they are associated with the\n   cleanup and removal of discharged hazardous substances\"; court also\n   noted that declaratory relief was appropriate because it would \"resolve\n   any uncertainties over who is responsible for future cleanups\").\n\n                                   28\n\n\n\n    \"removal\" or \"remedial\" action as defined by section 101 of\n     CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. S 9601(23), (24). See generally br. at 53\n     (citing United States v. Lowe, 118 F.3d 399, 401-02 (5th\n     Cir. 1997), which held, contrary to our decision in United\n     States v. Rohm and Haas Co., 2 F.3d 1265 (3d Cir. 1993),\n     that EPA's costs incurred in oversight of the private party\n     cleanup of site were compensable \"response costs\"\n     pursuant to section 107(a) of CERCLA). Appellants state\n     that the court erred in finding that ESI's fees were those of\n     \"an ordinary expert witness,\" inasmuch as\"an `expert\n     witness' is clearly required only in the context of litigation\n     while, by contrast, Plaintiffs have been forced to retain and\n\f utilize the expertise of ESI, an environmental consultant,\n for the past fifteen years due to the lack of progress made\n by Essex with respect to the Property's `detoxification.' \" Br.\n at 53.\n\nAppellants' argument thus raises the issue of whether\n ESI's fees are \"necessary costs of response\" for which\n appellants, as private parties, may recover in a suit\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) against Essex, the party\n indisputably responsible for the cleanup of the Property\n pursuant to the Clean-Up Plan approved by the DEP. To\n answer that question, we must ascertain the character of\n the costs in question, and determine whether they fall\n within the types of costs recoverable by an innocent party\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA.\n\nWe begin with the relevant statutory language. Section\n 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. S 9607(a)(4), provides that\n certain enumerated parties \"shall be liable for .. . all costs\n of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States\n Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent\n with the national contingency plan; [and] . . . any other\n necessary costs of response incurred by any other person\n consistent with the national contingency plan. . . .\" The\n statute defines \"response\" as \"remove, removal, remedy,\n and remedial action,\" and states that these terms include\n \"enforcement activities related thereto.\" See CERCLA\n section 101(25), 42 U.S.C. S 9601(25). It then defines\n \"remove or removal\" and \"remedy or remedial action\" as\n follows:\n\n                               29\n\n\n\n       (23) The terms `remove' or `removal' means[sic] the\n        cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances\n        from the environment, such actions as may be\n        necessary taken in the event of the threat of release of\n        hazardous substances into the environment, such\n        actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and\n        evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous\n        substances, the disposal of removed material, or the\n        taking of such other actions as may be necessary to\n        prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public\n        health or welfare or to the environment, which may\n        otherwise result from a release or threat of release. The\n        term includes, in addition, without being limited to,\n        security fencing or other measures to limit access,\n        provision of alternative water supplies, temporary\n        evacuation and housing of threatened individuals not\n        otherwise provided for, action taken under section\n        9604(b) of this title, and any emergency assistance\n        which may be provided under the Disaster Relief and\n\f       Emergency Assistance Act. . . .\n\n       (24) The terms `remedy' or `remedial action' means [sic]\n        those actions consistent with permanent remedy taken\n        instead of or in addition to removal actions in the event\n        of a release or threatened release of a hazardous\n        substance into the environment, to prevent or minimize\n        the release of hazardous substances so that they do\n        not migrate to cause substantial danger to present or\n        future public health or welfare or the environment. The\n        term includes, but is not limited to, such actions at the\n        location of the release as storage, confinement,\n        perimeter protection using dikes, trenches, or ditches,\n        clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released\n        hazardous substances and associated contaminated\n        materials, recycling or reuse, diversion, destruction,\n        segregation of reactive wastes, dredging or excavations,\n        repair or replacement of leaking containers, collection\n        of leachate and runoff, onsite treatment or\n        incineration, provision of alternative water supplies,\n        and any monitoring reasonably required to assure that\n        such actions protect the public health and welfare and\n        the environment. The term includes the costs of\n        permanent relocation of residents and businesses and\n\n                               30\n\n\n\n       community facilities where the President determines\n        that, alone or in combination with other measures,\n        such relocation is more cost-effective than and\n        environmentally preferable to the transportation,\n        storage, treatment, destruction, or secure disposition\n        offsite of hazardous substances, or may otherwise be\n        necessary to protect the public health or welfare; the\n        term includes offsite transport and offsite storage,\n        treatment, destruction, or secure disposition of\n        hazardous substances and associated contaminated\n        materials.\n\nSection 101(23)(24), 42 U.S.C. S 9601(23), (24) (footnotes\n omitted).\n\nAs we explained in United States v. Rohm and Haas Co.,\n \"[i]n general, removal actions are short term responses to a\n release or threat of release while remedial actions involve\n long term remedies.\" 2 F.3d at 1271. Here, while appellants\n fail to recognize explicitly the distinction between\"removal\"\n and \"remedial\" actions and do not attempt to place ESI's\n consultant fees in either category, given the character of the\n costs at issue we believe that if the activities involved here\n are included within the definition of \"response costs,\" it is\n because they are \"removal\" rather than \"remedial\" actions.\n\f Cf. id. (noting that the parties agreed that if the\n government's oversight activities were deemed \"necessary\n costs of response,\" it would be because they were removal\n actions rather than remedial actions).\n\nAlthough the district court believed that ESI's consulting\n fees are best characterized as those of an \"ordinary expert\n witness,\" appellants contest that statement by indicating\n rather cryptically in their brief that ESI has been\n appellants' environmental consultant for \"fifteen years with\n respect to the Property's `detoxification,' \" and therefore\n contend that we cannot consider ESI to be an \"expert\n witness\" retained only for litigation purposes. While\n appellants fail to cite an applicable portion of the record in\n support of that statement, our review of the parties'\n submissions confirms that Cohen testified at his deposition\n that appellants had retained ESI as a consultant as early\n as 1987 or 1988. See SA at 527.\n\n                                31\n\n\n\nNevertheless, based on our study of the record, exercising\n plenary review we conclude that the district court did not\n err in concluding that ESI's consulting fees for which\n appellants seek reimbursement were litigation-related\n expenses. Inasmuch as private parties may not recoup\n litigation-related expenses in an action to recover response\n costs pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA, see Key\n Tronic Corp. v. United States, 511 U.S. 809, 819-20, 114\n S.Ct. 1960, 1967 (1994); Redland Soccer Club, Inc. v.\n Department of the Army, 55 F.3d 827, 850 (3d Cir. 1995),\n and appellants do not claim to have incurred any other\n costs which fall within the definition of \"necessary costs of\n response,\" we agree with the district court's disposition of\n the CERCLA claim.\n\nIn Redland Soccer Club, we determined that the Redland\n plaintiffs' litigation costs, which included attorney's fees,\n health risk assessments and expert witness fees, were not\n \"response costs\" under any of the statutory definitions\n found in section 9601 of CERCLA. 55 F.3d at 849-50 &\n n.12 (citing, inter alia, Key Tronic Corp., 511 U.S. at 819,\n 114 S.Ct. at 1967, which held that litigation-related\n attorney's fees were not recoverable in a private response\n cost recovery action). In reaching our result, wefirst\n observed that \"under section [107], plaintiffs may only\n recover response costs which are necessary and consistent\n with the [National Contingency Plan].\" Id. at 850. Second,\n we found that \"[t]he heart of these definitions of removal\n and remedy are `directed at containing and cleaning up\n hazardous releases.' . . . [T]herefore[,] . . . `necessary costs\n of response' must be necessary to the containment and\n\f cleanup of hazardous releases.\" Id. (quoting United States v.\n Hardage, 982 F.2d 1436, 1448 (10th Cir. 1992) (alteration\n in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Given that\n the costs incurred were all litigation-related expenses\n unrelated to any remedial or response action at the\n property itself, we stated that \"we do not believe the district\n court erred in determining that plaintiffs' costs are not\n response costs because they are not `monies . . . expended\n to clean up sites or to prevent further releases of hazardous\n chemicals.' \" Id. (quoting Redland Soccer Club, Inc. v.\n Department of Army, 801 F. Supp. 1432, 1435 (M.D. Pa.\n 1992), aff 'd in relevant part, 55 F.3d 827 (3d Cir. 1995)).\n\n                               32\n\n\n\nHere, as in Redland, the record required the district court\n to reach its conclusion that the costs for which the parties\n involved were seeking reimbursement were litigation-related\n expenses, and thus do not fall within the definition of\n \"necessary costs of response.\" We first point out that,\n notwithstanding appellants' use of ESI's services prior to\n the commencement of this litigation, the billing statements\n that appellants submitted as proof of the amounts\n expended for ESI's service were for \"consulting fees.\"\n Importantly, the billing statements cover services that ESI\n rendered in connection with the Property intermittently\n from November 1996 to May 1998. See SA at 1-17.\n Obviously, inasmuch as appellants filed their complaint in\n the district court in March 1997, appellants are seeking\n reimbursement for consulting services rendered just prior\n to the time that they commenced this litigation, as well as\n reimbursement for services during the duration of the\n proceedings in the district court. The timing of the\n transactions demonstrates that the district court correctly\n concluded that ESI performed consulting services in\n anticipation of appellants instituting this litigation, and also\n performed consulting work during the pendency of this\n litigation.\n\nIn this connection, we find it significant that Cohen\n prepared an expert report for purposes of this litigation on\n behalf of ESI for appellants dated April 28, 1998, see app.\n at 412a, and that ESI correspondingly recorded a\n significant charge on its billing statement to USLR for that\n billing period. See SA at 13. The only reasonable inference\n we can draw from these circumstances is that the\n \"consulting fee\" that appellants paid to ESI for that time\n period represented, at least in significant part, ESI's\n payment for its preparation of the expert report.\n\nSecond, we note that the record reflects, and it is not\n disputed, that as appellants' environmental consultant,\n\f ESI's responsibilities were limited to reviewing Essex's\n quarterly reports it submitted to the DEP, and to providing\n appellants with a summary or analysis of Essex's progress\n in completing its remediation and detoxification efforts in\n accordance with the approved Clean-Up Plan. See app. at\n 466a; see also SA at 527. Indeed, ESI was not involved in\n\n                                33\n\n\n\nEssex's cleanup effort; it neither performed an investigation\n of the Property nor gathered data for that purpose. In our\n view, the nature of Essex's responsibilities toward its\n clients as described in the record thus confirms that it was\n retained to assess, for litigation purposes, whether Essex\n was complying with its contractual responsibility to cleanup\n the Property pursuant to the requirements set out in the\n Clean-Up Plan.\n\nMoreover, it is relevant to our analysis that Berger's\n deposition testimony, as appellants' designated Rule\n 30(b)(6) witness, is far from illuminating on the necessary\n costs of response issue. Contrary to the spirit of Rule\n 30(b)(6), Berger's evasive answers provide us with little\n assistance in determining the exact purpose for which\n appellants retained ESI, the nature of ESI's services that\n are referenced cryptically in the billing invoices in the\n record, and whether the costs incurred in relation thereto\n were the result of litigation-related consultation or were\n incurred in connection with work performed for some other\n purpose. Berger's responses clearly do not suggest that\n ESI's consulting fees were anything other than expenses\n incurred in connection with the lawsuit that appellants\n eventually might file if they were not satisfied with Essex's\n progress (and ultimately did file) against appellees. We only\n need cite the following colloquy between Essex's counsel\n and Berger, which occurred at his deposition, to illustrate\n our point:\n\n       Q: [Referring to the invoices for ESI] Mr. Berger, have\n        you ever seen those bills before?\n\n       A. I have no idea.\n\n       Q. Well, then look through them.\n\n       A. I could look through them for the next five hours\n        and I would have no idea. We've 90 properties. I get\n        bills from people. There are bills going into 1997 and\n        before. I have no idea whether I have ever seen these\n        bills or any other bills you might put in front of me\n        today.\n\fQ. Mr. Berger, other than the charges represented in\n those bills, are there any other costs that have been\n\n                         34\n\n\n\nexpended by any plaintiff for any environmental\n consulting or removal or remediation with respect to\n the Black Horse Lane property?\n\nA. I have no idea.\n\nQ. Do you know a man named Mr. Irving Cohen?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How long have you known him?\n\nA. I would say about ten years.\n\nQ. And in what capacity do you know him?\n\nA. Mr. Cohen was the president of Enviro-Sciences. It's\n an environmental consulting firm.\n\nQ. Has that firm ever been used by [appellant] Black\n Horse Lane Associates?\n\nA. I have no idea.\n\nQ. Looking through the exhibits, if you could, could\n you tell me whether those bills appear to indicate that\n such was the case?\n\nA. These bills are--at least the ones that I can see here\n --are from Enviro-Sciences, Inc. They reference Essex\n Chem, and I will tell you that every one references\n Essex Chem, except for those that reference Black\n Horse Lane, which is the subject property of this\n lawsuit. Other than that, I can't tell you anything\n about these bills. All I'm doing is reading from the bills\n for you.\n\nQ. Turn to the bills that talk about Black Horse Lane,\n Phase One, I believe.\n\nA. There's a bill dated 10-16-97 that says `Phase One,\n Black Horse Lane.'\n\nQ. All right. To what does that bill refer?\n\nA. I don't understand the question.\n\f       Q. What does Phase One, Black Horse Lane refer to?\n\n       A. I have no idea.\n\n                                35\n\n\n\n       Q. Did you ever order a Phase One on Black Horse\n        Lane?\n\n       A. I have no idea.\n\n       Q. Do you have an understanding what the phrase\n        `Phase One' means?\n\n       A. Yes, I do.\n\n       Q. What is that?\n\n       A. It's a preliminary environmental report which\n        basically points out areas of potential environmental\n        concern.\n\n       Q. Does it include any invasive testing, as far as you\n        know?\n\n       A. Typically, no.\n\n       Q. Do you have any idea why Black Horse Lane would\n        have ordered a Phase One at or about the time period\n        for which the bill is indicated?\n\n       A. Sitting here today, I have no idea why we did or\n        didn't. I suspect if we did, in fact, order one a year ago,\n        at that point I had a reason for it, but I don't know\n        what that reason would be sitting here today. If, in\n        fact, we did order a Phase One. I don't recall that\n        either.\n\nApp. at 544a. Our review of the remainder of Berger's\n deposition testimony regarding the nature of ESI's\n consulting work for appellants confirms that he failed to\n offer any useful information concerning the factual basis for\n appellants' CERCLA response cost claim relating to the fees\n paid for ESI's services. See generally app. at 544a-49a.\n\nGiven the totality of the information in the record, we\n agree with the district court's assessment of the nature of\n ESI's consulting responsibilities to its client during the time\n period for which appellants seek reimbursement. We believe\n that the record requires the conclusion that ESI's work was\n designed to assess, for potential or actual litigation\n purposes, the extent of Essex's remediation efforts and its\n\f progress in that regard. Accordingly, ESI's consulting fees\n charged in connection with its services are not\"response\n\n                                36\n\n\n\ncosts\" that are recoverable in a private cost recovery suit\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA.12\n\nIn any event, assuming arguendo that we were to accept\n appellants' position that ESI's consulting fees were not for\n strictly \"litigation costs\" in the sense that appellants\n retained ESI's services during the relevant time period\n solely to assist them in preparing to litigate this matter, we\n nevertheless would reach the result we do, primarily for two\n reasons. First, appellants cannot reasonably deny that the\n record demonstrates that ESI's role was limited to\n evaluating Essex's progress on the cleanup effort and to\n reporting its progress (or lack thereof) to appellants. Indeed,\n it is significant that neither appellants nor ESI have played\n any role in the containment and cleanup of the Property. At\n best, it appears that ESI served as appellants'\n environmental advisor in relation to the Property, and that\n appellants simply monitored, for their own benefit, Essex's\n progress in its cleanup efforts. Given that neither ESI nor\n appellants were involved in any capacity in the actual\n environmental cleanup of the Property, it is clear that the\n fees appellants paid in connection with ESI's consulting\n work did not relate to any remedial or response action at\n the Property. As in Redland, the funds for which appellants\n seek reimbursement were not \"necessary to the\n containment and clean up of hazardous releases,\" see\n Redland, 55 F.3d at 850 (emphasis added), inasmuch as\n appellants simply had no involvement in any remedial or\n removal actions on the Property. Cf. Key Tronic Corp., 511\n U.S. at 820, 114 S.Ct. at 1967 (stating that \"some lawyers'\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Again, we have not overlooked the circumstance that there are\n references in the record to the fact that Cohen performed some\n undefined environmental work for appellants prior to the dates found on\n the billing invoices in the record. See, e.g. , app. at 546a (Berger\n testifying\n that he had a \"general recollection\" that Cohen of ESI performed\n \"environmental work\" for Black Horse Lane Associates prior to February\n 14, 1997). Nevertheless, as we previously stated, the invoices submitted\n indicate that the environmental consulting for which appellants seek\n reimbursement in this cost recovery claim began in November 1996 and\n continued intermittently through May 1998. Thus, while it appears that\n ESI performed work for appellants prior to its work for which they seek\n reimbursement, that fact is irrelevant inasmuch as appellants only seek\n reimbursement for those amounts listed on the billing invoices.\n\f                                37\n\n\n\nwork that is closely tied to the actual cleanup may\n constitute a necessary cost of response in and of itself\n under the terms of S 104(a)(4)(B),\" andfinding that the\n component of claim that covers attorneys' work in\n identifying other potentially responsible parties fell within\n that category).\n\nSecond, inasmuch as ESI's role was limited to reviewing\n the manner in which Essex was performing its legal\n obligation to remediate the Property and reporting Essex's\n progress to appellants, we think it fair to characterize ESI\n as an \"overseer\" of Essex's progress on behalf of appellants.\n But our decision in Rohm & Haas precludes appellants\n from recovering such \"oversight\" costs as\"response costs\"\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA. In Rohm &\n Haas, we held that the EPA could not recover from the\n statutory responsible party the cost of its \"oversight\" of the\n remedial actions performed and paid for by the private\n party. See 2 F.3d at 1278. The oversight costs the EPA\n incurred there included \"direct costs (i.e. , hiring contractors\n to provide sampling support and field investigation) and\n indirect costs (i.e., travel costs, payroll, hiring contractors to\n review [defendants'] work\"). Id. at 1269 n.4 (emphasis\n added). We stated that the \"key issue\" was whether\n CERCLA's definition of \"removal\" should be read \"to\n encompass the government's activity in overseeing a\n removal or remedial action paid for and conducted by\n private parties.\" Id. at 1275.\n\nIn reaching our conclusion, we looked to the definition of\n \"removal\" found in section 101(23) of CERCLA, and noted\n that \"[n]owhere in the definition of removal is there an\n explicit reference to oversight of activities conducted and\n paid for by a private party.\" Id. at 1275. Moreover, we\n reviewed the five categories in the definition of removal,\n with particular focus on the third of the five, i.e., \"such\n actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and\n evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous\n substances,\" as the EPA argued that it was that aspect of\n the definition that applied to permit recovery of the\n oversight costs it sought. In analyzing this language, we\n rejected the EPA's argument that it supported the relief\n requested, explaining our holding as follows:\n\n                                38\n\n\n\n       Examined in a vacuum, this language could be\n       understood to encompass at least some oversight of the\n\f         activities of a private party, particularly private\n         activities focusing on assessment of the risk. On the\n         other hand, it is at least as plausible to read this\n         language as referring only to actual monitoring of a\n         release or threat of release rather than oversight of the\n         monitoring and assessment activities of others. This\n         latter reading would be consistent with an\n         understanding of the definition that distinguishes at all\n         stages--assessment, response formulation, and\n         execution--between actions taken to define the scope\n         of the risk created by a release or threatened release\n         and actions taken to evaluate the performance of\n         others to determine whether they are meeting their\n         legal obligations. We believe a reading of the statutory\n         definition that embraces this distinction is\n         linguistically the more plausible one.\n\n Id. at 1275-76. We further concluded that\"[a]ll things\n  considered, we cannot say that clause [3] of the removal\n  definition is sufficient to constitute the clear statement of\n  intent required by [National Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v.\n  United States, 415 U.S. 336, 342, 94 S.Ct. 1146, 1149-50\n  (1974) (\"NCTA\")].\"13 Id. at 1276.\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 13. Obviously, we premised our result in Rohm & Haas on our\n  application of the NCTA doctrine, which we believed required the EPA to\n  demonstrate \"a clear statement of congressional intent\" for it to\nrecover\n  the oversight costs as response costs. See 2 F.3d at 1273, 1276. But our\n  application of the NCTA doctrine does not undermine our reliance on our\n  statutory interpretation analysis in Rohm & Haas as germane here.\n  Plainly put, we reach our result because the language of the relevant\n  statutory provisions requires that we do so. Indeed, the only plausible\n  basis for finding that appellants' oversight actions through ESI are\n  \"removal\" activities is if they fall within the third category of\n\"removal\"\n  actions, i.e., actions \"necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the\n  release or threat of release of hazardous substances.\" But as we\n  explained in Rohm & Haas, this language plainly refers to actual\n  monitoring, assessment or evaluation \"of a release or a threat of\nrelease.\"\n  Id. at 1275 (emphasis added). Here, ESI's oversight activities, to the\n  extent that we are willing for the sake of argument to deem them\n  monitoring, assessment or evaluation activities, were not related to the\n  release or threat of release of hazardous substances. Rather, the object\n  of ESI's reports, insofar as we can tell from the record, was to analyze\n  Essex's removal activities, including its cleanup, disposal, monitoring\n  and assessment actions, as described in its quarterly reports to the\nDEP.\n\n                                 39\n\fOur interpretation of the removal definition as excluding\n the sort of \"oversight\" costs that the EPA sought in Rohm &\n Haas compels the conclusion that appellants cannot\n recover the funds paid to ESI for its consultant work, even\n though appellants are private entities rather than a\n governmental agency. As in Rohm & Haas, appellants seek\n reimbursement from Essex, the responsible party, for costs\n appellants incurred in monitoring the responsible party's\n compliance with its legal obligations. See Rohm & Haas, 2\n F.3d at 1279 n.23 (\"The oversight costs here held to be\n non-recoverable are incurred at a different level of\n supervision. They are the costs of overseeing the\n performance of the entity that has assumed responsibility\n for the cleanup.\"). Indeed, there is no dispute in this case\n that Essex is bound contractually to complete remediation\n and detoxification of the Property, and that appellants have\n not assisted Essex in meeting its statutory and contractual\n obligations. In this sense, then, the district court was\n correct in its observation that the costs for which\n appellants seek reimbursement were not incurred as a\n result of appellants' actions in cleaning up the Property.\n\nObviously then, inasmuch as our holding in Rohm &\n Haas precludes the EPA from seeking reimbursement for\n \"oversight\" costs incurred in overseeing the performance of\n a private entity where a private party has assumed\n responsibility for the cleanup, an analysis of the scope of\n the \"removal\" definition necessarily requires us to reach the\n same result in a situation where a private party seeks\n reimbursement for overseeing another private party's legal\n obligation to cleanup a property. In short, we are satisfied\n that Congress did not intend section 107(a)(4)(B) to provide\n a private party with a cause of action against a responsible\n party for reimbursement of the party's expenses in\n retaining an environmental consultant for oversight\n purposes without direct involvement in the responsible\n party's remediation and detoxification efforts.\n\nIn sum, we are convinced that the district court correctly\n determined that appellants could not recover, pursuant to\n section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA, the monies they expended\n in consulting fees in connection with ESI's services during\n the relevant time period. We will affirm the district court's\n\n                                40\n\n\n\ndismissal of appellants' private cost recovery action pleaded\n in count III of the amended complaint.14\n\nB. District Court's Final Order of\n December 16, 1999\n\f Appellants next contend that the district court erred in\n  affirming the magistrate judge's letter opinion and order\n  entered June 30, 1999, which granted appellees' motion for\n  discovery sanctions against appellants pursuant to Rule\n  37(b) and (d).15 As we previously mentioned, the magistrate\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 14. We also will dismiss appellants' Spill Act claim under Count IV. See\n  n.11, supra. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, count V of the\n  complaint pleaded a claim for \"damages\" stemming from appellees'\n  alleged \"acts, omissions and breaches.\" App. at 66a. The district court\n  dismissed this count, stating that \"[b]ecause plaintiffs have failed to\n  adduce sufficient evidence in support of their breach of contract\nclaims,\n  they cannot recover the damages outlined in Count Five of the\n  Complaint.\" Id. at 16a. Inasmuch as we agree with the district court's\n  dismissal of counts I through IV of the complaint, we will affirm the\n  district court's dismissal of count V, as there is no independent\n  substantive basis for appellants' claim for relief.\n\n 15. Appellants also maintain that the district court erred in dismissing\n  appellees' counterclaim without prejudice. The counterclaim sought a\n  declaratory judgment that remediation of the Property under the\n  Agreement included use of \"engineering and institutional controls,\" and\n  an order requiring appellants to consent to them. App. at 80a-81a.\n  Appellees explain that their counterclaim actually sought an order\n  compelling appellants to consent to their use of a Classification\n  Exception Area (\"CEA\"), which is \"a remediation by passive rather than\n  active means.\" App. at 845a.\n\n As we previously mentioned, appellants initially sought partial\n   summary judgment to dismiss the counterclaim with prejudice, but the\n   district court denied their motion in its order of August 10, 1999,\n   reasoning that appellants failed to demonstrate that they were entitled\nto\n   judgment as a matter of law. The court observed that appellants failed\n   to cite any authority in support of the motion, and\"merely allege[d]\nthat\n   `Plaintiffs do not and need not consent' to the engineering and\n   institutional controls.\" App. at 16. After the court dismissed the\n   amended complaint in its entirety, appellees moved for summary\n   judgment on the counterclaim. After oral argument on appellees' motion,\n   the court entered an order dismissing the counterclaim without\n\n                                 41\n\n\n\n judge agreed with appellees' argument that Berger's\n  conduct warranted a sanction in the form of precluding\n  appellants from asserting a position and introducing\n  evidence contrary to the position Berger asserted during his\n  deposition. In addition, the magistrate judge concluded that\n\f  Berger's lack of preparedness at his deposition justified the\n  imposition of monetary sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d) in\n  the form of costs and attorney's fees associated with taking\n  the deposition and bringing the sanctions motion before the\n  court. App. at 22a. The magistrate judge clearly set forth\n  the factual and legal basis for his ruling, relying primarily\n  on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Southern Union Co., 985 F.2d 196\n  (5th Cir. 1993) (\"Southern Union\"):\n\n        Here, Berger was not completely prepared on any\n         occasion for which he sat for a deposition. Further, his\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n prejudice, because, in its view, there was no current case or controversy\n  with respect to the subject matter of the counterclaim.\n\n We have reviewed the entire record, and we agree with the district\n  court's disposition of the counterclaim. It appears that the appellees\n  instituted the counterclaim in response to certain statements by\n  appellants to the effect that they would not consent to the use of a CEA\n  to remediate the Property, and would oppose any application that Essex\n  made to the DEP for that purpose. Appellees' br. at 14. Nevertheless,\nthe\n  court's dismissal of the counterclaim was appropriate because appellees\n  do not dispute that Essex has not applied for a CEA, and presently\n  cannot do so. Accordingly, appellants' threats to the effect that they\n  would not consent to the use of a CEA do not present a controversy ripe\n  for resolution, and the court did not err in dismissing the counterclaim\n  without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See, e.g.,\n  Philadelphia Fed'n of Teachers v. Ridge, 150 F.3d 319, 323 (3d Cir.\n  1998) (discussing and applying ripeness doctrine in context of claims\n  seeking declaratory relief, and noting that \"[t]he function of the\n  ripeness\n  doctrine is to prevent federal courts, `through avoidance of premature\n  adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.' \")\n  (quoting Abbot Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507\n  (1967), overruled on other grounds, Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99,\n  105, 97 S.Ct. 980 (1977)); The Presbytery of N.J. v. Florio, 40 F.3d at\n  1462 (addressing ripeness issue in context of suit seeking declaratory\n  relief and stating that \"[i]t is the plaintiff 's responsibility to\nallege\n  facts\n  that invoke the court's jurisdiction\").\n\n                                 42\n\n\n\n        lack of preparation cannot be a mere oversight but is,\n         instead, a clear demonstration of bad faith. This is\n         obvious from Berger's repeated denial of any knowledge\n         of his status as a 30(b)(6) witness despite being present\n         at the deposition and being asked each and every time\n\f       he appeared if he had knowledge of his status. Further,\n       Berger, as did the plaintiffs' witness in Resolution Trust\n       Corp., even denied knowledge of documents which he\n       himself had signed, claiming that he had no\n       recollection of such documents despite acknowledging\n       that he normally did not sign anything that he did not\n       read first. These infractions would not be so\n       detrimental if Berger were no so consistent with his\n       apparent incompetence and lack of cooperation. Had\n       he taken the time to prepare in the slightest as Rule\n       30(b)(6) requires, he might have been fully prepared for\n       at least one deposition. Additionally, Berger's actions\n       are magnified by his status as a member of the Bar.\n\nApp. at 21a.\n\nIn affirming the magistrate judge's order, the district\n court provided its reasons on the record:\n\n       I read the record. It is appalling. It is appalling.\n\n       [Berger] did nothing except show his face only under\n       the threat of court orders. When he showed up, he\n       knew he was a 30(b)(6) witness and, notwithstanding\n       the fact that he knew he was a 30(b)(6) witness, he\n       refused to answer questions in an intelligent way. He\n       refused to prepare, as you are required to prepare\n       under 30(b)(6), to intelligently answer questions and\n       just literally thumbed his nose at the defendants and,\n       frankly, at the Court.\n\n       . . . .\n\n       I'm satisfied, based upon my review of the record--and\n        I defy anyone to look at the record here which was\n        created by Mr. Berger--that the actions taken by[the\n        magistrate judge] were well within his discretion and\n        do not constitute either an abuse of discretion or are\n        they contrary to law or shocking to the conscience of\n        the Court.\n\n                                43\n\n\n\n       One, in order to come to that conclusion, one must\n       live in the shoes of [the magistrate judge] in trying to\n       conduct orderly discovery in this matter.\n\n       One must review meticulously the record of\n       noncompliance by Mr. Berger in this matter.\n\n       [The magistrate judge] did not issue this opinion\n       lightly. [The magistrate judge] was fully cognizant of\n\f         the totality of the facts surrounding this matter, which\n         border upon almost conscious disregard of the Court\n         and the court rules. . . .\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n App. at 836a, 843a-44a.\n\n Appellants make two arguments in support of their\n  request to vacate the monetary sanctions order. 16 They first\n  claim that the district court abused its discretion in\n  affirming the magistrate judge's monetary sanctions\n  because the court misunderstood the requirements for\n\n  imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d). They assert\n  that Rule 37 required as a prerequisite to imposing a\n  monetary sanction that the court first issue an order\n  compelling appellants to supply the requested discovery\n  responses, and then find that they failed to do so. See\n  Reply Br. at 29. They further claim that pursuant to Rule\n  37(d), \"a party making a motion based upon an alleged\n  violation of Rule 37(d) must certify that the movant has in\n  good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party\n  failing to answer or respond in an effort to obtain such\n  answer or response without court action,\" but that there\n  was no such \"good faith\" effort by appellees to resolve the\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 16. Appellants also claim that the court abused its discretion in\ngranting\n  appellees' motion pursuant to Rule 37(b) to the extent that it precluded\n  appellants from asserting at trial a position which differs from\nBerger's\n  testimony. Given that we are affirming the summary judgment\n  dismissing the amended complaint in its entirety, we need not address\n  this argument. Also, appellants apparently contend that the court erred\n  in awarding a monetary sanction pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2). This\n  argument is without merit, as it is clear to us that the court awarded\n  attorney's fees and costs pursuant to subdivision (d) of Rule 37 rather\n  than subdivision (b). See App. at 22a (citing Rule 37(d)).\n\n                                 44\n\n\n\n dispute without court action. Reply Br. at 30 (internal\n  quotation marks omitted).\n\n Finally, they rely on the fact that Rule 37(d) states that\n  sanctions may be imposed when a party, inter alia, \"fails\n  . . . to appear before the officer who is to take the\n  deposition, after being served with a proper notice.\" Here,\n  they argue that we should apply the \"fails to appear\"\n  language literally, and that sanctions were inappropriate in\n\f     this case because Berger appeared for his deposition after\n     the magistrate judge's October 15, 1998 order and\"testified\n     under oath for more than seventeen hours.\" Br. at 59-60. In\n     support of their literal reading of Rule 37(d), they rely\n     primarily on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's\n     opinion in R.W. International Corp. v. Welsh Foods, Inc., 937\n     F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1991), which stated that \"Rule 37(d)\n     sanctions apply only when a deponent `literally fails to\n     show up for a deposition session.' \" Id. at 15 n.2 (quoting\n     Salahuddin v. Harris, 782 F.2d 1127, 1131 (2d Cir. 1986)).\n\n Their second argument is based on their interpretation of\n  Berger's behavior during his deposition. They claim that\n  even if we agree with the magistrate judge's finding that\n  Rule 37(d) could support the imposition of sanctions when\n  a Rule 30(b)(6) witness provides inadequate and evasive\n  answers, the record demonstrates that Berger's deposition\n  did not present a situation warranting sanctions. They\n  claim that \"[a] fair examination of the transcript of Mr.\n  Berger's 570-page deposition confirms that Mr. Berger\n  testified fully and in good faith in response to Defendants'\n  questioning.\" In any event, they maintain that\"any\n  `violation' of Rule 30(b)(6) which might be said to have\n  existed was minimal, and indeed, paled in comparison with\n  the extraordinarily broad discovery obtained by Defendants\n  in this matter.\" Br. at 63.\n\n We are not persuaded by either contention. Beginning\n  with appellants' interpretation of the language of Rule 37(d),17\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 17. Rule 37(d) provides:\n\n          (d) Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers\n     to\n           Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection. If a party\nor\n     an\n            officer, director, or managing agent of a party or a person\n     designated\n\n                                   45\n\n\n\n they simply are incorrect that the magistrate judge\n  committed an error of law in awarding a monetary sanction\n  to appellees. Initially, we point out that unlike subdivision\n  (b) of Rule 37, on its face subdivision (d) does not require\n  the court, prior to imposing sanctions, to have issued an\n  order compelling discovery. See Al Barnett & Son, Inc. v.\n  Outboard Marine Corp., 611 F.2d 32, 35 (3d Cir. 1979) (\"[A]\n  direct order by the Court, as Rule 37(a) and (b) requires, is\n  not a necessary predicate to imposing penalties under Rule\n\f    37(d).\"), repudiated on other grounds, Alexander v. Gino's\n    Inc., 621 F.2d 71 (3d Cir. 1980); compare Fed. R. Civ. P.\n    37(b)(2) (\"If a party . . . or a person designated under Rule\n    30(b)(6) . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit\n    discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of\n    this rule . . . .\") with Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(d) (stating that if the\n    party fails, inter alia, to appear for a deposition, \"the court\n    . . . may make such orders in regard to the failure as are\n    just\"). Moreover, while appellants claim that subdivision (d)\n    _________________________________________________________________\n\n            under Rule 30(b)(6) or 31(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails\n(\n    1) to\n            appear before the officer who is to take the deposition, after\n    being\n          served with a proper notice, or (2) to serve answers or\nobjections\n   to\n          interrogatories submitted under Rule 33, after proper service of\n   the\n          interrogatories, or (3) to serve a written response to a request\n   for\n          inspection submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the\n          request, the court in which the action is pending on motion may\n          make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among\n          others it may take any action authorized under subparagraphs (A),\n          (B), and (C) of subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. Any motion\n   specifying\n          a failure under clause (2) or (3) of this subdivision shall\ninclude\n   a\n          certification that the movant has in good faith conferred or\n          attempted to confer with the party failing to answer or respond\nin\n   an\n          effort to obtain such answer or response without court action. In\n          lieu of any order or in addition thereto, the court shall require\n   the\n          party failing to act or the attorney advising that party or both\nto\n   pay\n          the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the\n          failure unless the court finds that the failure was substantially\n          justified or that other circumstances make an award of expenses\n          unjust.\n\n           The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be\n           excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable\n           unless the party failing to act has a pending motion for a\n    protective\n           order as provided by Rule 26(c).\n\n                                    46\n\frequires the party seeking sanctions to certify in their\n motion papers that they conferred or attempted to confer in\n good faith with the party failing to answer or respond in an\n effort to avoid court intervention, subdivision (d) explicitly\n only requires such a certification where the motion specifies\n a failure \"under clause (2) or (3) of this subdivision.\" Fed.\n R. Civ. P. 37(d). Here, appellees made the motion for\n sanctions based on clause (1) of subdivision (d), which\n deals with a party's failure \"(1) to appear before the officer\n who is to take the deposition.\" Id.\n\nIn addition, while we recognize that the court's statement\n in Welsh Foods supports appellants' interpretation of the\n language of Rule 37(d)--namely that it requires an actual\n \"no show\" to satisfy the \"fails to appear\" requirement in\n subdivision (1)--they apparently have overlooked the\n circumstance that the magistrate judge's decision relied on\n Southern Union, 985 F.2d 196. Importantly, in Southern\n Union the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a\n literal interpretation of Rule 37(d) in situations where\n the uncooperative deponent is a party's Rule 30(b)(6)\n designated witness.\n\nIn Southern Union the defendant Southern Union Co.\n (\"Southern Union\") served notice on the RTC that it\n intended to depose it pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6), and set\n forth with specificity ten discrete topics with which the\n deponent was to be familiar. After the RTC designated two\n individuals as Rule 30(b)(6) deponents, Southern Union's\n representatives traveled from Washington, D.C. to Dallas,\n Texas, to conduct the depositions. Neither representative,\n however, possessed any knowledge relevant to the matters\n designated in the Rule 30(b)(6) notice. Consequently,\n Southern Union moved for sanctions, and the district court\n granted the motion, awarding costs and fees incurred in\n deposing the RTC's two witnesses and in identifying\n ultimately the proper deponent with knowledge of the\n relevant facts. See id. at 196-97.\n\nRelying upon the Court of Appeals for the Second\n Circuit's opinion in Salahuddin, a case cited subsequently\n in Welsh Foods, the RTC contended that sanctions\n pursuant to Rule 37(d) were not appropriate because both\n witnesses literally appeared for their depositions, albeit that\n\n                                47\n\n\n\nneither was helpful or forthcoming with pertinent\n information. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\n\f rejected that argument, reasoning:\n\n       Were we here faced with a case involving the deposition\n        of a natural person we might be inclined to agree with\n        the reading of Rule 37(d) by our Second Circuit\n        colleagues [in Salahuddin]. The deposition of a\n        corporation, however, poses a different problem, as\n        reflected by Rule 30(b)(6). Rule 30(b)(6) streamlines the\n        discovery process. It places the burden of identifying\n        responsive witnesses for a corporation on the\n        corporation. Obviously, this presents a potential for\n        abuse which is not extant where the party noticing the\n        deposition specifies the deponent. When a corporation\n        or association designates a person to testify on its\n        behalf, the corporation appears vicariously through\n        that agent. If that agent is not knowledgeable about\n        relevant facts, and the principal has failed to designate\n        an available, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable\n        witness, then the appearance is, for all practical\n        purposes, no appearance at all.\n\n       In the instant case, RTC possessed documents that\n       clearly identified [the eventual deponent] as having\n       personal knowledge of the subject of the deposition.\n       RTC did not furnish those documents or designate\n       [that deponent] until after it had designated Perry and\n       Wieting, obliged Southern Union's counsel to travel\n       from Washington, D.C. to Dallas for a useless\n       deposition, and been served with Southern Union's\n       motion for sanctions. The finding that RTC did not\n       make a meaningful effort to acquit its duty to designate\n       an appropriate witness is manifest. The district court\n       did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees and costs\n       under Rule 37(d).\n\nId. at 197-98.\n\nFollowing the reasoning in Southern Union, several courts\n similarly have read the phrase \"fails . . . to appear\" in Rule\n 37(d) pragmatically in light of the purposes of Rule 30(b)(6)\n and the parties' obligations thereunder. See, e.g., Starlight\n Int'l Inc. v. Herlihy, 186 F.R.D. 626, 639 (D. Kan. 1999)\n\n                               48\n\n\n\n(\"Corporations, partnerships, and joint ventures have a\n duty to make a conscientious, good-faith effort to designate\n knowledgeable persons for Rule 30(b)(6) depositions and to\n prepare them to fully and unevasively answer questions\n about the designated subject matter.\"); The Bank of New\n York v. Meridien Biao Bank Tanzania Ltd., 171 F.R.D. 135,\n 151 (S.D.N.Y. 1997) (\" `Producing an unprepared witness is\n\f tantamount to a failure to appear.' \") (quoting United States\n v.

P. 30(b)(6) notice); see also, e.g., Turner v. Hudson\n Transit Lines, Inc., 142 F.R.D. 68, 78-79 (S.D.N.Y. 1991)\n (\"[A] party that fails to provide witnesses knowledgeable in\n the areas requested in a Rule 30(b)(6) notice is likewise\n subject to sanctions.\"); Thomas v.

Miss. 1989) (\"Sanctions are\n appropriate when a party fails to comply with a request\n under Rule 30(b)(6) to provide a knowledgeable deponent to\n testify on behalf of the organization.\"); see generally Boland\n Marine & Mfg. Co. v. M/V Bright Field, No. 97-3097, 1999\n WL 280451, at *3 (E.D. La. May 3, 1999) (acknowledging\n the rule announced in Southern Union butfinding that\n deponent was prepared adequately and that sanctions were\n not warranted).\n\nWe agree with the distinction the Court of Appeals drew\n\n                                49\n\n\n\nin Southern Union, and find its analysis persuasive.18 In\n reality if a Rule 30(b)(6) witness is unable to give useful\n information he is no more present for the deposition than\n would be a deponent who physically appears for the\n deposition but sleeps through it. Indeed, we believe that the\n purpose behind Rule 30(b)(6) undoubtedly is frustrated in\n the situation in which a corporate party produces a witness\n who is unable and/or unwilling to provide the necessary\n factual information on the entity's behalf. See generally\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 30 advisory committee's notes (stating that\n the procedure outlined in subdivision (b)(6) should be\n viewed as \"an added facility for discovery\" and would \"curb\n the `bandying' by which officers or managing agents of a\n corporation are deposed in turn but each disclaims\n\f knowledge\" of relevant facts). \"For courts to permit litigants\n to disregard the responsibilities that attend the conduct of\n litigation would be tantamount to `encouraging dilatory\n tactics.' \" Al Barnett & Son, Inc., 611 F.2d at 35 (quoting\n Cine Forty-Second Street Theatre v. Allied Artists Pictures\n Corp., 602 F.2d 1062, 1068 (2d Cir. 1979)). Thus, we hold\n that when a witness is designated by a corporate party to\n speak on its behalf pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6), \"[p]roducing\n an unprepared witness is tantamount to a failure to\n appear\" that is sanctionable under Rule 37(d). See Taylor,\n 166 F.R.D. at 363. Accordingly, we conclude that the\n district court did not commit an error of law in affirming\n the magistrate judge's sanctions order entered pursuant to\n Rule 37(d), as the magistrate correctly applied the Court of\n Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's construction, which we\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n18. We point out that the cases appellants cite in addition to Welsh\n Foods in further support of their argument are equally unhelpful, as\n none of them involved a situation in which the uncooperative and/or\n unknowledgeable witness was a corporate entity's Rule 30(b)(6) designee.\n See, e.g., Estrada v. Rowland, 69 F.3d 405, 405-06 (9th Cir. 1995)\n (deponent was plaintiff pursuing action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983\n against prison officials); Aziz v. Wright, 34 F.3d 587, 588-89 (8th Cir.\n 1994) (same); Salahuddin, 782 F.2d at 1131 (same); Stevens v.\n Greyhound Lines, Inc., 710 F.2d 1224, 1228 (7th Cir. 1983) (deponent\n was plaintiff in employment discrimination suit); SEC v. Research\n Automation Corp., 521 F.2d 585, 587 (2d Cir. 1975) (deponent was\n individual defendant and president of corporate defendant).\n\n                                50\n\n\n\napprove, of the phrase \"fails . . . to appear\" in Southern\n Union.\n\nWe reject appellants' final contention that Berger's\n responses during his deposition did not support the district\n court's finding that he failed to cooperate with appellees'\n attorneys, and that his conduct was tantamount to a\n failure to appear that warranted sanctions under Rule\n 37(d). To the contrary, our review of Berger's deposition\n testimony in its entirety confirms the observations of both\n the magistrate judge and the district court on this point.\n Indeed, throughout his lengthy deposition, Berger failed to\n offer meaningful testimony about most, if not all, of the\n items specified in the notice of deposition. While we need\n not recite every instance in which Berger's testimony was\n incomplete and unhelpful on the specified topics, we believe\n that two examples of his uncooperative attitude and his\n flagrant disregard for his obligation as a Rule 30(b)(6)\n witness amply illustrate our point.\n\fFirst, when Berger was asked about the Agreement he\n signed between USLR and Essex, he stated that he had no\n recollection of (1) seeing or signing the Agreement, (2)\n negotiating the Agreement (or who participated in its\n negotiation), (3) drafting the various provisions in the\n Agreement (or who participated in its drafting), or (4) the\n circumstances surrounding the purchase of the Property,\n i.e., if he attended the closing and where it occurred, even\n though he admitted that he was personally involved in the\n purchase of the Property and \"probably negotiated the\n contract.\" See app. at 525a. Second, when asked about any\n and all cleanup costs appellants' incurred as a result of the\n contamination on the Property, Berger testified that he did\n not know: (1) whether appellants spent any money to\n cleanup hazardous waste; (2) whether appellants performed\n any environmental evaluation or investigation on the\n Property, whether they incurred costs in doing so, and\n whether there are any records that such tests were\n performed; (3) whether appellants hired ESI to perform\n consulting services for the Property, and if so, the dates\n and purposes for which appellants retained ESI; (4)\n whether ESI's billing statements in the record reflected\n work performed on the Property or other unrelated services;\n\n                                51\n\n\n\nand (5) whether appellants performed any removal or\n remedial actions on the Property. App. at 521a, 523-25a,\n 544a-49a.\n\nObviously, as appellants' Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Berger\n should have been prepared to discuss these and other\n topics designated in the notice of deposition. Instead, he\n divulged as little information as possible in every area that\n appellees identified. Moreover, Berger's uncooperative\n attitude is demonstrated further by statements in which he\n claimed that he was unaware that he was appellants'\n designated Rule 30(b)(6) representative, did not know what\n the phrase \"Rule 30(b)(6) representative\" meant, and was\n not familiar with Rule 30(b)(6) or what it required him to\n do. App. at 513a-14a, 527a, 544a. He also admitted at one\n point that he did not recall whether he reviewed the notice\n of deposition prior to the date of the deposition, app. at\n 527a, and later stated clearly that he had not bothered to\n read it at all. App. at 610. Simply put, we find his professed\n ignorance on these points particularly unconvincing given\n that he obtained undergraduate and law degrees from\n prestigious universities and has been licensed to practice\n law since \"either [19]65 or [19]66.\" App. at 508a.\n\nIn any event, we believe that the magistrate judge's\n finding that Berger engaged in discovery abuses plainly is\n\f justified on this record. The magistrate judge had ample\n evidence of Berger's failure to cooperate, which in turn\n rendered his deposition a virtual non-event. Accordingly, we\n will affirm the monetary sanctions ordered pursuant to\n Rule 37(d).\n\nIV.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis matter comes before this court on an appeal by\n plaintiffs United States Land Resources, L.P. (\"USLR\"),\n United States Realty Resources, Inc. (\"USRR\"), Black Horse\n Lane Associates, L.P. (\"Black Horse\"), and Lawrence S.\n Berger (\"Berger\") (collectively \"appellants\") from two orders\n entered by the district court in this matter: (1) the order\n entered August 10, 1999, granting a motion by appellees\n Dow Chemical Corporation (\"Dow\") and Essex Chemical\n Corporation (\"Essex\") for summary judgment pursuant to\n Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, and denying appellants' cross-motion for\n summary judgment on appellees' counterclaim; and (2) the\n \"Final Order\" entered December 16, 1999, affirming the\n June 30, 1999 order of the magistrate judge imposing\n sanctions against appellants, and dismissing appellees'\n counterclaim without prejudice for lack of subject matter\n jurisdiction. This litigation arises out of a sale of\n environmentally distressed real property located at 120\n Black Horse Lane, South Brunswick, New Jersey\n (hereinafter \"the Property\"), by Essex to USLR.\n\n                                 2\n\n\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we will affirm the August 10,\n 1999 and December 16, 1999 orders of the district court in\n all respects.\n\nII. FACTS and PROCEEDINGS\n\nA. Factual Background\n\nThe historical facts in this case are rather straightforward\n and, insofar as material to this appeal, essentially are not\n disputed. Appellants, USLR, USRR, Black Horse, and\n Berger, are related entities: USLR is the general partner in\n Black Horse, USRR is the general partner of USLR, and\n Berger is the president of USRR.1 Appellees Essex and Dow\n also are related entities as Essex is Dow's wholly-owned\n subsidiary by virtue of its purchase of all of Essex's stock\n in 1988.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Essex owned and operated the\n Property, where it engaged in the business of preparing\n\f adhesive-backed paper products. On or about August 17,\n 1984, Essex discovered that chemicals it used in that\n process had leaked into the ground of the Property. In\n October 1984, Essex entered into environmental cleanup\n and decommission negotiations with the New Jersey\n Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\"). Essex\n submitted a \"Clean-Up Plan\" to the DEP on December 19,\n 1985, which the DEP conditionally approved on December\n 20, 1985.\n\nPrior to Essex's submission of the Clean-Up Plan to the\n DEP, it entered into a sales agreement (\"the Agreement\") on\n September 5, 1985, with USLR to sell the Property to USLR\n for $3.6 million. The parties do not dispute that appellants\n were aware of the Property's environmental problems at the\n time that USLR and Essex entered into the Agreement. The\n Agreement required Essex to obtain and implement an\n approved Clean-Up Plan at its sole expense. Paragraph 16\n of the Agreement set forth Essex's responsibilities with\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Also, Berger is a named partner in the lawfirm representing\n appellants.\n\n                                3\n\n\n\nrespect to the remediation and detoxification of the\n Property:\n\n       The parties acknowledge that the Subject Premises to\n        be conveyed are subject to the provisions of the\n        Environmental Clean-Up Responsibility Act, N.J.S.A.\n        13:1K-6 et seq. (`ECRA') [now named the Industrial Site\n        Recovery Act (`ISRA')]. Seller agrees to obtain approval\n        of a Clean-Up Plan from the Department of\n        Environmental Protection (`DEP'), post the necessary\n        financial security for performance pursuant to ECRA,\n        will implement the approved Clean-Up Plan and\n        complete the detoxification of the Subject Premises in\n        accordance with and to the approval of the DEP.\n        Pending DEP approval of a Clean-Up Plan, Seller will\n        attempt to obtain the consent of the DEP to the\n        conveyance of the Subject Premises. `ECRA Approval'\n        will be deemed to have taken place upon the receipt by\n        Seller from the DEP of the approval of the\n        implementation of the Clean-Up Plan and satisfactory\n        detoxification of the Subject Premises or a consent\n        from the DEP to convey the Subject Premises to\n        Purchaser in the form of an Administrative Consent\n        Order and bond securing the detoxification of the\n        Subject Premises by Seller, all in a form and substance\n        satisfactory to Purchaser's mortgage lender. In no event\n\f       shall Purchaser be obligated under this Contract to\n       assume any ECRA Clean-Up responsibilities. If ECRA\n       Approval is not obtained prior to January 1, 1986,\n       Purchaser shall have the continuing right to terminate\n       this Contract by giving Seller notice at any time up to\n       January 20, 1986. If ECRA Approval is not obtained by\n       June 1, 1986, this Contract shall be automatically\n       terminated and after the refund of the Deposit to\n       Purchaser, neither party shall have any rights or\n       claims against the other arising out of this Contract.\n\nApp. at 93a-94a. Title to the Property closed on December\n 23, 1985, three days after the DEP conditionally approved\n the Clean-Up Plan, and on that day USLR assigned its\n rights in the Property to its present owner, appellant Black\n Horse.\n\n                                4\n\n\n\nAs previously mentioned, at some point in 1988, appellee\n Dow purchased all of Essex's stock, and Essex became a\n wholly-owned subsidiary of Dow. Since that time, Dow\n employees have been involved in the remediation and\n detoxification of the Property, but these Dow employees\n have been acting as \"consultants\" to Essex in that\n connection. SA at 546, 549.\n\nEssex began its soil remediation efforts shortly after it\n sold the Property in 1985. While we are not able to\n ascertain the exact date of completion from the record,\n appellants' counsel confirmed at oral argument that soil\n remediation was finished within two years of the sale of the\n Property. See generally app. at 235a; SA at 536; appellees'\n br. at 17. Essex commenced groundwater remediation in\n 1988, app. at 236a, but, to date, it has not completed that\n remediation. It is Essex's alleged failure to complete\n remediation and detoxification of the Property within a\n \"reasonable time\" that forms the crux of the parties' dispute\n in this case.\n\nOne specific example that appellants cite as proof of\n Essex's alleged failure to remediate the Property within a\n reasonable time pertains to Essex's cleanup efforts with\n respect to certain \"chlorinated volatile organic compounds\"\n (\"CVOCs\") found in the soil and groundwater in certain\n areas of the Property.2 In 1991, the DEP ordered Essex to\n perform a \"temporary well point survey\" to investigate the\n presence and source of CVOCs found in the groundwater\n and soil gas. See app. at 304a. After Essex conducted\n extensive investigations into the source and levels of\n CVOCs found in the soil gas and groundwater, Essex\n proposed to remediate the areas of the Property\n\f contaminated with CVOCs by means of soil vapor\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n2. \"CVOCs\" is a shorthand reference to those volatile organic compounds\n that Essex used to clean the plant's adhesive-backed paper rolls.\n The CVOCs found on the northeastern and eastern portions of\n the Property include tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, trans-1,2-\n dichloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. App. at 237a. Essex discovered\n trace amounts of CVOCs on the eastern and northeast corners of the\n Property in 1985, but the concentrations were so low that at that time\n DEP did not require Essex to address them. See appellees' br. at 19;\n App. at 200a, 237a; SA at 553.\n\n                                5\n\n\n\nextraction (\"SVE\") technology, specifically, a \"dual phase\n extraction system.\" App. at 307a. In May 1992, DEP\n approved this proposal. App. at 307a, 240a.\n\nNotwithstanding DEP's approval of Essex's proposed\n system, Essex did not begin to install and operate the\n system immediately. Rather, from 1992 to 1997, Essex\n continued to investigate the source of the various CVOCs\n found on the Property, and conducted various tests at\n DEP's request. See app. at 238a-40a. This additional\n investigation required Essex to modify the SVE design,\n which requirement might account for the delay in its\n installation. App. at 240a. In any event, Essex completed\n its installation of the dual-phase extraction system in\n August 1997. We note, however, that Essex experienced\n some \"start up\" difficulties at the outset of its operation of\n the system. App. at 240a. Insofar as we can determine from\n the record, Essex is continuing its remediation efforts in\n connection with the CVOCs detected on the Property.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\nAppellants commenced this action in the district court in\n 1997, and filed an amended complaint shortly thereafter.\n The amended complaint sets forth five causes of action\n against appellees Essex and Dow:3 (1) a claim based on a\n breach of Paragraph 16 of the sales contract as a result of\n Essex's failure to complete its cleanup of the Property\n within a \"reasonable time\", (count I);4 (2) a claim based on\n a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair\n dealing based on \"defendants' \" actions in connection with\n their cleanup efforts, (count II); (3) a claim for damages\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of the Comprehensive\n Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act\n (\"CERCLA\"), 42 U.S.C. S 9607(a)(4)(B), based on appellants'\n alleged expenditure of \"necessary costs of response,\" and\n _________________________________________________________________\n\f3. Inasmuch as the amended complaint refers to Essex and Dow\n collectively as \"defendants\" and asserts allfive claims against each\n entity, we refer to the defendants together as \"appellees\" unless\n otherwise noted.\n\n4. The count does not use the term \"reasonable time\" but appellants\n contend that a reasonable time provision is implicit in the Agreement.\n\n                                6\n\n\n\nfor declaratory and injunctive relief, (count III); (4) a claim\n for contribution for the costs of \"clean-up and removal\" and\n for injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to the New\n Jersey Spill Compensation and Control Act, N.J. Stat. Ann.\n S 58:10-23.11 et seq. (\"the Spill Act\"), (count IV); and (5) a\n claim for \"damages\" based on appellees' breach of the\n Agreement \"as well as the contamination with respect to the\n subject Property for which defendants are responsible,\"\n (count V). See app. at 67a. Appellees filed an answer to the\n amended complaint and a counterclaim seeking declaratory\n relief that remediation of the Property under Paragraph 16\n of the Agreement included use of \"engineering and\n institutional controls\" and an order requiring appellants to\n consent to them. App. at 80a-81a.\n\nThe parties commenced discovery on November 7, 1997.\n Appellants designated Berger as their Fed. R. Civ. P.\n 30(b)(6) witness to testify on behalf of USLR, USRR and\n Black Horse. On October 2, 1998, appellees' counsel began\n to depose Berger, but counsel was not able to obtain a date\n to reconvene the deposition. As a result of counsels'\n inability to agree on the date that Berger's deposition\n should resume, appellees' counsel sought an order from the\n magistrate judge overseeing discovery to set the date for the\n resumption of the deposition. After a teleconference with\n the parties on October 6, 1998, the magistrate judge signed\n an order dated October, 9, 1998, which provided the\n following:\n\n       IT IS on this 9th day of October, 1998, ORDERED, as\n        follows:\n\n       1. Lawrence S. Berger, as Plaintiffs' Fed. R. Civ. P.\n        30(b)(6) designated witness and fact witness, shall\n        appear for oral deposition commencing on Tuesday,\n        October 13, 1998, at 10:00 a.m. and continuing from\n        day to day thereafter until completed.\n\nApp. at 657a.\n\nNotwithstanding the court's directive, when appellees'\n\f counsel appeared at Berger's law office to continue his\n deposition on October 13, 1998, Berger failed to appear and\n his counsel, Paul Schafhauser, was \"in trial\" and not in the\n\n                                7\n\n\n\noffice. SA at 60-61. At that point, appellees' counsel again\n sought the court's intervention.\n\nOn October 15, 1998, the magistrate judge signed and\n entered an order which directed that Berger's deposition\n recommence on Monday, October 19, 1998, at 10:00 a.m.\n App. at 660a. The order also provided that \"[a]s a sanction\n for failure by Lawrence Berger to appear for depositions on\n Tuesday, October 13, Plaintiffs shall promptly pay the fees\n and costs of counsel fees for defendants (a) for appearing at\n Mr. Berger's non-deposition on October 13, and (b) for\n bringing this application and appearance today.\" App. at\n 660a. While Berger appeared for his deposition at the\n designated date and time, appellees claim that he provided\n evasive and non-responsive answers to many of counsel's\n questions relating to the negotiation and execution of the\n Agreement, and appellants' damages allegations. See\n generally app. at 540a-655a.\n\nAfter the completion of discovery, the parties filed several\n motions germane to this appeal. First, appelleesfiled a\n motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n 56, seeking dismissal of the amended complaint in its\n entirety. Appellants opposed the motion, and filed a cross-\n motion for summary judgment on appellees' counterclaim\n for declaratory relief. In addition, appellees filed a motion\n before the magistrate judge for discovery sanctions\n pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b), (d), seeking to preclude\n appellants \"from asserting, at trial, a position which differs\n from the testimony of their Rule 30(b)(6) witness.\" App. at\n 20a. Appellees also sought reimbursement of the attorney's\n fees and costs associated with Berger's deposition and their\n filing of the second sanctions motion.\n\nThe magistrate judge granted appellees' request for\n sanctions pursuant to Rule 37 by letter opinion and order\n entered June 30, 1999. Relying on Rule 37(b) and (d), he\n agreed that Berger's conduct warranted the sanction\n appellees requested, namely that appellants would be\n precluded from asserting a position and introducing\n evidence contrary to the positions Berger asserted during\n his deposition. The court also concluded that Berger's lack\n of preparedness at his deposition warranted the imposition\n of monetary sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d) in the form of\n\n                                8\n\f costs and attorney's fees associated with taking the\n  deposition and bringing the sanctions motion before the\n  court. App. at 22a. Appellants filed an appeal from the\n  magistrate judge's order to the district court.\n\n In the meantime, after hearing oral argument on the\n  cross-motions for summary judgment on June 28, 1999,\n  see app. at 806a-831a, the district court granted appellees'\n  motion on the amended complaint and denied appellants'\n  cross-motion on the counterclaim by letter opinion and\n  order entered August 10, 1999. Addressing appellees'\n  motion first, the district court determined that dismissal of\n  the amended complaint in its entirety was appropriate for\n  several reasons, each of which we will discuss in greater\n  detail in the discussion that follows.5\n\n With respect to the breach of contract claim (count I), the\n  court held that Paragraph 16 of the Agreement did not\n  contain a provision requiring Essex to remediate the\n  Property in a \"reasonable time,\" and, given the commercial\n  context in which the parties negotiated and executed the\n  Agreement and appellants' subsequent conduct, the court\n  should not imply that the contract had a reasonable time\n  provision. See app. at 10a. Alternatively, it stated that even\n  if it were to assume that there is an implicit \"reasonable\n  time\" provision in Paragraph 16 of the Agreement,\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 5. Before engaging in a substantive analysis of appellants' claims\nagainst\n  Essex, the district court dismissed with prejudice all claims appellants\n  asserted against Dow, reasoning that\n\n           (1) plaintiffs' causes of action arise solely out of plaintiffs'\n            contractual relationship with defendant Essex; (2) Dow and Essex\n            are not related except to the extent that Dow acquired Essex's\n  stock;\n           (3) Essex is a responsible party and not insolvent; and (4) there\n  is\n         not even a scintilla of evidence that would justify piercing\n  Essex's\n         corporate veil.\n\n App. at 7a n.1. Appellants assert that the district court erred in\n  dismissing outright the claims against Dow, claiming that there are\n  factual issues concerning whether it is a proper party in this suit. We\n  will affirm the court's dismissal of Dow without further discussion as\n  appellants' argument clearly is without merit. In any event, our\n  affirmance of the summary judgment for Essex means that Dow cannot\n  be liable to appellants.\n\f                                9\n\n\n\nappellants failed to adduce any evidence from which a\n reasonable jury could conclude that 14 years, i.e., from\n 1985 to the date of the district court's decision, was an\n unreasonably long time period to complete the type of\n detoxification and remediation called for in the Clean-Up\n Plan. App. at 11a. Turning next to appellants' claim based\n on the alleged breach of the implied covenant of good faith\n and fair dealing (count II), the court found that appellants\n failed to produce sufficient evidence that Essex acted in bad\n faith or engaged in misconduct that caused the delay in\n completing the cleanup of the Property. App. at 13a.\n\nThird, the court dismissed the CERCLA and Spill Act\n claims for damages on the ground that appellants could not\n demonstrate that they incurred any compensable costs\n under either statute. The court pointed out that the only\n costs that appellants allegedly incurred were the fees they\n paid to their consultant, Enviro-Sciences, Inc. (\"ESI\"), but\n that such fees were not compensable under either the\n CERCLA or the Spill Act. App. at 15a. The court also denied\n appellants' request for injunctive and declaratory relief\n under CERCLA and the Spill Act, reasoning that\n declaratory relief was inappropriate because \"plaintiffs have\n utterly failed to make any showing that they are likely to\n incur any future costs that will be recoverable\" under either\n statute. It further found that injunctive relief was not\n warranted in view of the circumstance that Essex\"is\n contractually and statutorily bound to detoxify the\n Property,\" and there was no evidence that Essex had\n breached the contract or violated CERCLA or the Spill Act.\n App. at 15a-16a. Next, the court dismissed count V, stating\n that \"because plaintiffs have failed to adduce sufficient\n evidence in support of their breach of contract claims, they\n cannot recover the damages outlined in Count Five of the\n Complaint.\" App. at 16a.\n\nFinally, the district court addressed and denied\n appellants' cross-motion for summary judgment on the\n counterclaim, noting that appellants \"cite no authority in\n support of their motion,\" but \"merely allege that `Plaintiffs\n do not and need not consent to any [engineering and\n institutional controls] with respect to the Property.' \"\n Ultimately the court found that \"[o]n the present record,\n\n                                10\n\n\n\nthis Court is unable to say that the plaintiffs are entitled,\n as a matter of law, to a judgment dismissing defendants'\n\f  counterclaims.\"6 App. at 17a. The court's order stated that\n  appellants' amended complaint was dismissed with\n  prejudice.\n\n After the district court ruled on the parties' dispositive\n  motions, on or about August 13, 1999, the district court\n  ordered the parties to file cross-motions with respect to\n  Essex's counterclaim. App. at 775a. On December 13,\n  1999, the district court heard oral argument on the cross-\n  motions, and also considered appellants' outstanding\n  appeal from the magistrate judge's sanctions order. Ruling\n  on the outstanding motions the district court (1) affirmed\n  the magistrate judge's sanctions order, and (2) dismissed\n  Essex's counterclaim against appellants without prejudice\n  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the\n  controversy set forth in the counterclaim was not ripe. See\n  app. at 832a-49a. The district court then memorialized its\n  record rulings in its \"Final Order\" entered December 16,\n  1999. App. at 23a. The monetary sanctions have been\n  quantified and we understand that appellants have paid\n  them.\n\n Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal to this court\n  from the district court's orders of August 10, 1999, and\n  December 16, 1999. App. at 34a. The appellees do not\n  cross-appeal from the dismissal of their counterclaim. We\n  have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1291.7 Of course,\n  the fact that the dismissal of the counterclaim was without\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 6. The court also addressed and denied appellees' motion for sanctions\n  pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. That aspect of the court's ruling is not\n  in issue in this appeal, and we need not address it any further.\n\n 7. The district court exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n28\n   U.S.C. S 1331 inasmuch as count III of the amended complaint asserted\n   a claim pursuant to CERCLA. The district court exercised supplemental\n   jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n   S 1367. We exercise plenary review over the district court's dismissal\nof\n   appellants' amended complaint and the counterclaim, see Nelson v.\n   Upsala College, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692976\"><a href=\"/opinion/692976/johnetta-nelson-v-upsala-college-robert-e-karsten-george-w-freyberger/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 385 (3d Cir. 1995), and review the court's\n   disposition of the sanctions issue pursuant to Rule 37 for an abuse of\n   discretion.

DISCUSSION\n\nAs is evident from our recitation of the procedural history\n leading to this appeal, appellants challenge several of the\n district court's rulings made during the proceedings in this\n matter. First, we will address the court's August 10, 1999\n order dismissing the amended complaint. Then, we will\n review the district court's December 16, 1999 order\n dismissing appellees' counterclaim without prejudice, and\n affirming the magistrate judge's sanctions order.\n\nA. District Court's Dismissal of\n        the Amended Complaint\n\n1. Breach of Contract Claim (Count I)\n\nAppellants focus most of their attention on the district\n court's dismissal of their breach of contract claim pleaded\n in count I of the amended complaint. While recognizing that\n under New Jersey law, courts generally find that there is a\n \"reasonable time\" term implicit in contracts that do not set\n forth any time limitation for performance, the district court\n nevertheless held that \"[i]n this case, the Court finds no\n justification for implying a `reasonable time' for\n performance because such a term is not `necessary to give\n business efficacy to the contract as written.' \" App. at 8a.\n The court explained that \"[a] main purpose of the\n Agreement, and the only purpose of Paragraph 16, was to\n require Essex to remediate the Property to the full\n satisfaction of the DEP and thereby make the land freely\n marketable.\" App. at 8a. The court found that\"a\n `reasonable time' limitation is not necessary because\n Essex's performance under the contract--obtainingfinal\n DEP approval--must be evaluated solely by reference to the\n DEP.\" App. at 9a. Accordingly, the court stated that \"such\n a contract simply does not lend itself to a reasonable time\n limitation.\" Id.\n\n                                   12\n\n\n\nIt also dismissed the breach of contract claim on the\n alternative ground that appellants presented insufficient\n evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that\n Essex breached its obligation to perform remediation and\n obtain DEP approval pursuant to the Clean-Up Plan within\n a \"reasonable time.\" On this point, the district court held as\n follows:\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that Essex has breached its contractual\n\f       obligation to complete the detoxification and obtain\n       final DEP approval `within a reasonable time.'\n       Therefore, to prevail, plaintiffs must show that a\n       `reasonable time' has already expired. The Agreement\n       was executed in 1985. This Court cannot say that\n       fourteen years is unreasonable as a matter of law. In\n       the context of an ISRA clean-up, which plaintiff Berger\n       understood to be a `cumbersome' and `long' process,\n       plaintiffs must adduce evidence that a `reasonable time'\n       for completion of the clean-up is less then fourteen\n       years. . . .\n\n       Such evidence might be in the form of reprimands or\n       other statements from regulatory agencies like the\n       DEP. Plaintiffs might also carry their evidentiary\n       burden with expert testimony that, under the\n       circumstances of this site and comparing it to other\n       sites, fourteen years is an unreasonable length of time.\n       In this case, however, plaintiffs have simply failed to\n       adduce any evidence that fourteen years is\n       unreasonable. The only evidence that even remotely\n       addresses this issue is contained in plaintiffs' expert\n       report. . . .\n\n       Giving plaintiffs the best of Mr. Cohen's report, `the\n       environmental program undertaken on this site has\n       been slow and ineffective in treating the contaminants\n       that were release by Essex Chemical.' But evidence of\n       a slow and ineffective clean-up process, without more,\n       cannot reasonably support an inference that fourteen\n       years is unreasonable.\n\nApp. at 11a-12a.\n\nAppellants contend that the court erred in dismissing\n their breach of contract claim because, notwithstanding the\n\n                                13\n\n\n\nabsence in Paragraph 16 of the Agreement of an explicit\n date by which Essex was to complete its cleanup of the\n Property and obtain DEP approval, by implication the\n Agreement requires Essex to fulfill its contractual\n obligations within a reasonable time. Appellants rely on the\n well-established principle of New Jersey law, which is\n applicable here on the contractual issues, that\" `[w]here no\n time is fixed for the performance of a contract, by\n implication a reasonable time was intended.' \" Br. at 41\n (quoting, inter alia, Becker v.

They claim that\n the district court erred in concluding that the nature of this\n particular contract, and Essex's obligation with respect to\n\f the remediation of the Property, rendered a \"reasonable\n time\" limitation unreasonable in the circumstances.\n Alternatively, they assert that at a minimum, there was a\n genuine issue of material fact as to whether the parties\n intended that Essex complete its remediation obligations\n within a reasonable time, thus precluding summary\n judgment in appellees' favor. Second, appellants contend\n that contrary to the district court's finding, they presented\n sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n conclude that Essex failed to remediate the Property within\n a \"reasonable time.\"\n\nAppellees respond that the district court correctly\n dismissed the breach of contract claim because appellants\n base their argument on the incorrect premise that\n Paragraph 16 omits a contractual provision which in turn\n requires the court to supply a \"reasonable time\" limitation.\n Br. at 36. They claim that contrary to appellants'\n construction of the contract, Paragraph 16 does contain a\n definite term for completion of the Property's remediation\n and therefore does not omit a contractual provision. In\n appellees' view the contract unambiguously provides the\n only term for completion that is reasonable in the\n circumstances--namely, that Essex's obligation is satisfied\n if the detoxification is undertaken \"in accordance with and\n to the approval of DEP.\" Br. at 35-36. They claim that the\n district court correctly determined that it would be\n unreasonable to find that the Agreement included an\n implied reasonable time limitation, given the commercial\n context of the sale and purchase.\n\n                                14\n\n\n\nAppellees further assert that, in any event, even if we\n agreed with appellants that the district court should have\n implied a \"reasonable time\" limitation on Essex's\n remediation obligations pursuant to Paragraph 16,\n summary judgment was appropriate because there is no\n evidence that Essex breached its contractual obligations in\n that connection. They claim that the district court correctly\n determined that appellants failed to meet their burden of\n producing evidence demonstrating that as of the date that\n appellants filed their complaint in the district court, Essex\n had failed to remediate and detoxify the Property in\n accordance with the Clean-Up Plan, and obtain DEP\n approval of its efforts, within a reasonable time.\n\nAppellees' protestations notwithstanding, we reject the\n district court's conclusion that a reasonable time provision\n was not implicit in Paragraph 16 of the Agreement. After\n all, New Jersey courts uniformly have applied the principle\n that \"where no time is fixed for the performance of a\n\f contract, by implication a reasonable time was intended.\"\n See Becker, 543 A.2d at 983 (contract for sale of real\n property); see also, e.g., River Dev.

Here, even viewing the facts in the light\n most favorable to appellants, we agree with the district\n court's assessment of the weakness of appellants' evidence\n as well as the court's conclusion that appellants failed to\n demonstrate that there was a genuine issue of material fact\n on the issue of whether Essex had breached its obligation\n to remediate the Property and obtain DEP approval within\n a reasonable time. Simply put, the record does not support\n the conclusion that appellants posit, i.e., that Essex\n breached its contractual duties to complete the remediation\n and detoxification efforts within a reasonable time.\n\nFor example, appellants first point to an Essex\"Expense\n Appropriation Request\" which indicated that the\n \"completion date\" of the entire project would be \"1987.\"9\n App. at 777a. But we do not share appellants' view that\n this evidence can support a conclusion that Essex breached\n Paragraph 16 of the Agreement. Obviously, the fact that\n\f Essex estimated its completion date incorrectly does not\n support the conclusion that it has failed to cleanup the\n Property within a reasonable time. While a party's advance\n estimate of the time to complete a project might be\n persuasive evidence of the reasonable time for that\n undertaking, it is not in the circumstances here in which\n the scope of the project was so uncertain.\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n9. According to the deposition testimony of Irwin Zonis, Essex's Chief\n Environmental Officer who was involved in the remediation and\n detoxification of the Property, the purpose of the Expense Appropriation\n Request was to notify Essex's financial department of the amount of\n funds deemed necessary for the completion of the project. He further\n explained that the document \"told the financial department that the\n $320,000 would be expended by the end of 1987.\" App. at 189a.\n\n                                17\n\n\n\nAppellants also rely on the fact that in March 1986,\n shortly after the DEP approved Essex's Clean-Up Plan, Dr.\n Calvin J. Benning (\"Benning\"), Director of Environmental\n Affairs for Essex, wrote to the DEP questioning whether\n certain of the standards set forth in the Clean-Up Plan with\n respect to the contemplated soil remediation and whether\n the Clean-Up Plan's requirements were reasonable in the\n circumstances. App. at 225a-26a. For convenience, we will\n refer to this correspondence as Essex's \"March 1986 letter.\"\n Appellants claim that the March 1986 letter was Essex's\n \"attempt[ ] to circumvent the parameters and conditions\" of\n its Clean-Up Plan, and that it demonstrates that Essex\n failed to proceed \"reasonably and diligently\" with the\n Property's detoxification. Br. at 46.\n\nWe cannot agree. The March 1986 letter questions the\n cleanup levels relating to the soil remediation which Essex\n completed within two years of the sale of the Property. See\n generally app. at 235a; appellees' br. at 17. Certainly if\n Essex also had completed the groundwater remediation\n within that period appellants would not have instituted\n litigation alleging a breach of Paragraph 16. Thus,\n inasmuch as appellants' breach of contract claim\n essentially is predicated on Essex's failure to complete\n groundwater remediation, we fail to see how this letter\n supports appellants' argument.\n\nSimilarly, appellants cite the fact that Essex did not\n begin groundwater remediation efforts until 1988 or\n remediation of the CVOCs until 1997. See br. at 47-48.\n However, appellants do not present evidence indicating that\n the delays were avoidable, and in any event, were\n unreasonable. Also they rely on the circumstance that\n\f groundwater pumping \"was frequently interrupted\n throughout the years,\" br. at 47, and that the DEP gave\n Essex a rating of \"unacceptable due to `failure to operate the\n groundwater remediation system in the capacity it was\n designed.' \" App. at 298a (emphasis added). But a review of\n the evidence in the record confirms that the interruptions\n Essex experienced are not a basis for holding that it\n unreasonably delayed its performance under Paragraph 16.\n To the contrary, intermittent delays are to be expected on\n a remediation project which cannot be compared to an\n\n                               18\n\n\n\nordinary construction project built in accordance with fixed\n plans which is thus far less likely to encounter problems\n than a remediation undertaking. Moreover, as appellees\n correctly point out, the DEP's \"unacceptable\" rating did not\n relate to the length of time that Essex had expended on the\n remediation and detoxification of the Property. Rather, the\n DEP comments related to the need for Essex to implement\n a sufficient maintenance program so that it could manage\n the problems it had been experiencing with the wells more\n efficiently in the future. See app. at 298a. Thus, we cannot\n view the DEP's comments as tantamount to a statement\n that Essex was taking too long to finish the Property\n cleanup.\n\nAs the district court correctly observed, app. at 11a-12a,\n appellants' strongest evidence on this score is a statement\n by their environmental consultant, Irving Cohen of ESI.\n Cohen issued a report in which he opined that \"the\n environmental program undertaken on this site has been\n slow and ineffective in treating the contaminants that were\n released by Essex Chemical.\" App. at 418a. In our view,\n however, this statement does not create a factual issue for\n the jury on the issue of unreasonable delay. Importantly,\n Cohen stops short of stating definitively that, given the\n circumstances, Essex had taken too long to complete its\n remediation and detoxification efforts. Moreover, even if he\n had stated such a conclusion it would not have an\n adequate foundation as he does not analyze specifically the\n types of contaminants involved in this project and the\n circumstances surrounding the remediation of this site. Nor\n does he compare Essex's efforts to other sites plagued with\n similar environmental contaminants. Given the vague\n nature of Cohen's conclusion, we agree with the district\n court's observation that \"evidence of a slow and ineffective\n cleanup process, without more, cannot reasonably support\n an inference that fourteen years is unreasonable.\" App. at\n 12a.\n\nWhen boiled down to its essence, appellants' argument is\n\f that because the cleanup of the Property has taken longer\n to finish than the parties originally anticipated, Essex has\n breached Paragraph 16 of the Agreement as it has not\n completed the cleanup within a \"reasonable time.\" While it\n\n                                19\n\n\n\nmay be unfortunate that it has taken Essex an extended\n period of time to complete the cleanup of this Property, the\n delay does not support a conclusion that the amount of\n time it already has spent is unreasonable given the nature\n of Essex's contractual obligation. By appellants' own\n admission, the remediation and detoxification of the\n Property is a large effort which, by its very nature, is a\n lengthy and time-consuming process. Given the realities of\n the situation, appellants simply have failed to point to any\n evidence in this record demonstrating that the length of\n time that Essex has taken to detoxify the Property and\n obtain DEP approval is unreasonable in the circumstances.\n Accordingly, we will affirm the district court's dismissal the\n breach of contract claim.\n\n2. Breach of the Implied Duty of Good Faith\n        and Fair Dealing (Count II)\n\nThe district court also dismissed appellants' claim based\n on Essex's alleged breach of the implied duty of good faith\n and fair dealing, reasoning:\n\n       In this case, plaintiffs allege only that Essex has failed\n        to complete the clean-up process and obtain final DEP\n        approval within a reasonable time. They point to no\n        acts or omissions done in bad faith. There is no\n        allegation, and certainly no evidence, that Essex has\n        committed any misconduct. Summary judgment is\n        therefore appropriate.\n\nApp. at 13a. Appellants claim that the district court erred\n in granting summary judgment on this claim because it\n ignored evidence from which a reasonable jury could\n conclude that Essex breached the implied duty of good faith\n and fair dealing during the course of its cleanup of the\n Property. Appellants point to the following evidence in\n support of their claim: (1) documents confirming that\n appellees \"attempted to renege upon the standards set forth\n in the Clean-Up Plan\"; (2) evidence showing that appellees\n \"inexplicably failed to even begin remediation for many\n years after delineating contamination on the Property\"; and\n (3) DEP documents reprimanding Essex for \" `violations' and\n `unacceptable' progress.\" Br. at 49.\n\n                                20\n\fTo be sure, \"every contract in New Jersey contains an\n implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\" Sons of\n Thunder, Inc. v.

The parties, however, do\nnot\n  dispute that New Jersey law applies in this case, and we will decide the\n  case on that basis.\n\n                                 22\n\n\n\n performance of its obligation to remediate the Property and\n  obtain DEP in accordance with Paragraph 16 of the\n  Agreement. They claim that since the DEP approved the\n  Clean-Up Plan in 1985, Essex has not performed its\n  cleanup in a diligent manner, and in fact, has engaged in\n\f bad faith conduct purposely to protract the process.\n According to appellants, Essex's conduct has precluded\n them from obtaining the fruits of their contract, i.e., a\n property that is not environmentally distressed.\n\nWe cannot agree that the evidence in this case supports\n the existence of a genuine issue of material fact on the\n issue of Essex's good faith in its performance of its\n obligation to remediate and detoxify the Property. In reality,\n appellants' argument rests exclusively on their subjective\n interpretation of the March 1986 letter in which Benning\n set forth the following reservations as to whether certain\n aspects of the Clean-Up Plan were reasonable in the\n circumstances:\n\n       The clean-up plan calls for the excavation and disposal\n        of the contaminated soil to a level of 1 ppm, . . . based\n        on the requirements of the case manager at BISE. I\n        believe these levels are extremely low and not\n        warranted. . . . We fully intend to remove the\n        contaminated dirt from the former tank farm area. . . .\n        However to satisfy BISE we are required to perform 15\n        separate sample analyses in the laboratory instead of\n        using a portable field analyzer to determine the extent\n        of pollution and excavation, and to excavate to 1 ppm\n        residual total VOC in the soil. I believe these\n        requirements are both unreasonable and unwarranted.\n        The clean up plan had to be approved by the end of\n        1985 and time was not available to question the\n        requirement or to rationally discuss these points.\n        However, the IAG discussion [which Benning attended\n        on March 18, 1986] indicate [sic] that the[DEP] has\n        also been rethinking some of their procedures and\n        actions. I believe hexane and heptane are classified as\n        hydrocarbon and I believe that a higher level than 1\n        ppm is perfectly justified.\n\nApp. at 225a-26a. Appellants claim that this letter exhibits\n Essex's lack of good faith and confirms that Essex\n\n                                23\n\n\n\nattempted to \"renege upon the standards set forth in the\n Cleanup Plan.\" Br. at 49; reply br. at 22-23.\n\nWhile the letter questions whether the cleanup level of 1\n ppm is warranted and whether lab analysis of soil samples\n is necessary as opposed to Essex merely conductingfield\n measurements of the soil, the letter does not demonstrate\n a lack of good faith on Essex's part in performing its\n obligations pursuant to Paragraph 16 of the Agreement.\n First, as we previously mentioned, the letter discusses\n\f Essex's obligations under the Clean-Up Plan relating to soil\n remediation, but appellants do not dispute that Essex has\n completed its soil remediation and detoxification efforts. In\n fact, appellants confirmed that Essex began its cleanup of\n the soil shortly after the sale, and that it completed soil\n remediation sometime within two years. Thus, we fail to see\n how this letter can demonstrate Essex's lack of diligence in\n that regard, or how Essex's conduct in questioning certain\n aspects of the Clean-Up Plan compromised appellants' right\n \"to receive the fruits of the contract.\" See Sons of Thunder,\n Inc., 690 A.2d at 587 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nMoreover, and perhaps more importantly, Benning wrote\n the March 1986 letter after he met with DEP officials and\n discussed the topic of appropriate cleanup levels in soil.\n The letter specifically states that the \"IAG discussion on\n March 18 indicate [sic] that the department has also been\n rethinking some of their procedures and actions.\" App. at\n 225a. Thus, while the letter questioned the reasonableness\n of certain aspects of the Clean-Up Plan, Benning's\n comments indicate that he did so because of his previous\n discussions with DEP officials which apparently led him to\n believe that the DEP might no longer view some of its\n requirements as necessary or appropriate. Thus, when\n viewed in context, the letter does not indicate that Essex\n intended to renege on its obligation to cleanup the Property,\n and it does not indicate that Essex performed its\n contractual obligations with a lack of good faith.\n\nIn any event, Benning's concern over certain aspects of\n the Clean-Up Plan is of no consequence when we consider\n that less than two months later, he wrote a memorandum\n to Essex officials in which he recognized and re-emphasized\n\n                                24\n\n\n\nEssex's obligation to adhere to the requirements set forth in\n Clean-Up Plan. The memorandum states:\n\n       Lately we have received letters from NJDEP and have\n        discussed our program and permit applications with\n        both state and local officials. These discussions have\n        led to some very specific program requirements and\n        items we must `keep in mind.'\n\n       For example:\n\n       1. The NJDEP's ECRA office and the department of\n        solid waste management have made it very clear\n        that we must adhere to the Clean Up Plan .\n\nApp. at 227a.\n\fSimply put, the fact that Benning questioned certain\n aspects of the Clean-Up Plan is not evidence that Essex\n acted in bad faith, as the DEP obviously responded to\n Benning's concerns by indicating that Essex was obligated\n to remediate the Property in accordance with the Clean-Up\n Plan, and Benning expressly reaffirmed Essex's intent to\n comply with its contractual and statutory obligations in\n that regard. Moreover, appellants do not demonstrate that\n Essex ever failed to implement a substantive remediation\n measure that the DEP required in connection with Essex's\n cleanup of the Property, and do not dispute that Essex\n completed soil remediation on the Property within two years\n of the sale. In our view, Benning's May 1986 memorandum\n reaffirming Essex's commitment to remediate the Property\n in accordance with the Clean-Up Plan belies appellants'\n assertion that the March 1986 letter evidences Essex's\n intent from the outset to conduct its remediation and\n detoxification efforts in \"bad faith.\" Reply br. at 23. In the\n circumstances, we will affirm the district court's dismissal\n of appellants' claim that Essex breached the duty of good\n faith and fair dealing.\n\n3. Appellants' CERCLA Claim (Count III)\n        and Spill Act Claim (Count IV)\n\nCount III of the amended complaint asserts a claim for\n damages and injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to\n CERCLA, and count IV seeks the same relief pursuant to\n\n                                25\n\n\n\nthe Spill Act. As previously mentioned, the district court\n dismissed the CERCLA claim, reasoning that appellants\n had not incurred any compensable \"necessary costs of\n response\" pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA. See\n 42 U.S.C. S 9607(a)(4)(B). In particular, the court explained\n that the only costs that appellants claimed to have incurred\n were the fees they paid to their environmental consultant,\n ESI. The district court found that those fees were not\n recoverable under CERCLA \"because they had nothing to\n do with any effort by plaintiffs to detoxify the Property or to\n prevent or minimize the release of hazardous substances.\"\n App. at 14a (emphasis added). The district court explained\n that the fees were not recoverable because ESI merely\n reviewed the quarterly reports that Essex submitted to\n appellants and the DEP; ESI never visited the Property,\n monitored the contamination or the cleanup of the\n Property, or gathered data related to the investigation or\n remediation of the Property. The district court stated that\n \"ESI's fees are those of an ordinary expert witness: the fees\n represent litigation costs, not environmental monitoring\n\f  costs.\" App. at 15a. Similarly, the court dismissed\n  appellants' Spill Act claim seeking to recover ESI's fees\n  because the fees \"are unrelated to any prevention,\n  mitigation, or remediation of contamination on the\n  Property.\" App. at 14a.\n\n The district court also denied appellants' request for a\n  declaration that Essex is liable to appellants for any future\n  costs pursuant to CERCLA or the Spill Act. The court\n  stated that \"[p]laintiffs have utterly failed to make any\n  showing that they are likely to incur any future costs that\n  will be recoverable under CERCLA or the Spill Act. Indeed,\n  it is undisputed that Essex is contractually obligated to\n  remediate the Property at its own expense.\" App. at 15a.\n  Inasmuch as there was \"no evidence--or even an allegation\n  --that the plaintiffs intend to participate in future clean-up\n  activities or incur any costs that might be recoverable\n  under CERCLA,\" the court concluded that granting\n  declaratory relief would be inappropriate.\n\n Finally, the court denied appellants' request for an\n  injunction compelling Essex to commence and complete the\n  cleanup on the basis that there was no present case or\n\n                                 26\n\n\n\n controversy. The court reasoned that \"[t]here is no dispute\n  that Essex is under both a contractual and statutory duty\n  to detoxify the Property; nor is there any dispute that Essex\n  has worked continuously to remediate the Property.\" The\n  court further explained that \"[i]n the absence of evidence\n  that Essex has breached the Agreement or violated CERCLA\n  or IRSA, there is no basis for the injunction that plaintiffs\n  seek.\" App. at 16a.\n\n On appeal from the CERCLA and Spill Act dispositions,\n  appellants primarily claim that the district court erred in\n  dismissing their CERCLA claim for monetary relief. 11 While\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 11. We will address only briefly the several other issues appellants\nraise\n  in connection with their CERCLA and Spill Act claims pleaded in counts\n  III and IV of the amended complaint. Specifically, appellants maintain\n  that the district court erred in rejecting their request for injunctive\n  and\n  declaratory relief pursuant to CERCLA, and in dismissing count IV of the\n  amended complaint, their Spill Act claim. First, appellants contend that\n  they are entitled to declaratory relief under CERCLA even if they have\n  not incurred any compensable response costs as of yet, \"[p]articularly\n  [because] in light of the inexplicable lack of progress by Defendants in\n  detoxifying the Property to date, Plaintiffs may well be forced to incur\n\f  future response costs to complete [the] detoxification. . . .\" Br. at 52\n  (citing Bowen Eng'g v.

First, appellants have\n  not presented any evidence with respect to their request for a\ndeclaratory\n  judgment as to future response costs under CERCLA demonstrating that\n  such relief is appropriate.

Thus, there is nothing in the record suggesting that\n  appellants ever will incur response costs, and there is no potential for\n  injury that is \"sufficiently immediate and real\" so as to warrant\n  declaratory relief pursuant to section 113(g)(2) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C.\n  S 9613(g)(2).

Appellants state\n     that the court erred in finding that ESI's fees were those of\n     \"an ordinary expert witness,\" inasmuch as\"an `expert\n     witness' is clearly required only in the context of litigation\n     while, by contrast, Plaintiffs have been forced to retain and\n\f utilize the expertise of ESI, an environmental consultant,\n for the past fifteen years due to the lack of progress made\n by Essex with respect to the Property's `detoxification.' \" Br.\n at 53.\n\nAppellants' argument thus raises the issue of whether\n ESI's fees are \"necessary costs of response\" for which\n appellants, as private parties, may recover in a suit\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) against Essex, the party\n indisputably responsible for the cleanup of the Property\n pursuant to the Clean-Up Plan approved by the DEP. To\n answer that question, we must ascertain the character of\n the costs in question, and determine whether they fall\n within the types of costs recoverable by an innocent party\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA.\n\nWe begin with the relevant statutory language. Section\n 107 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. S 9607(a)(4), provides that\n certain enumerated parties \"shall be liable for .. . all costs\n of removal or remedial action incurred by the United States\n Government or a State or an Indian tribe not inconsistent\n with the national contingency plan; [and] . . . any other\n necessary costs of response incurred by any other person\n consistent with the national contingency plan. . . .\" The\n statute defines \"response\" as \"remove, removal, remedy,\n and remedial action,\" and states that these terms include\n \"enforcement activities related thereto.\" See CERCLA\n section 101(25), 42 U.S.C. S 9601(25). It then defines\n \"remove or removal\" and \"remedy or remedial action\" as\n follows:\n\n                               29\n\n\n\n       (23) The terms `remove' or `removal' means[sic] the\n        cleanup or removal of released hazardous substances\n        from the environment, such actions as may be\n        necessary taken in the event of the threat of release of\n        hazardous substances into the environment, such\n        actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and\n        evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous\n        substances, the disposal of removed material, or the\n        taking of such other actions as may be necessary to\n        prevent, minimize, or mitigate damage to the public\n        health or welfare or to the environment, which may\n        otherwise result from a release or threat of release. The\n        term includes, in addition, without being limited to,\n        security fencing or other measures to limit access,\n        provision of alternative water supplies, temporary\n        evacuation and housing of threatened individuals not\n        otherwise provided for, action taken under section\n        9604(b) of this title, and any emergency assistance\n        which may be provided under the Disaster Relief and\n\f       Emergency Assistance Act. . . .\n\n       (24) The terms `remedy' or `remedial action' means [sic]\n        those actions consistent with permanent remedy taken\n        instead of or in addition to removal actions in the event\n        of a release or threatened release of a hazardous\n        substance into the environment, to prevent or minimize\n        the release of hazardous substances so that they do\n        not migrate to cause substantial danger to present or\n        future public health or welfare or the environment. The\n        term includes, but is not limited to, such actions at the\n        location of the release as storage, confinement,\n        perimeter protection using dikes, trenches, or ditches,\n        clay cover, neutralization, cleanup of released\n        hazardous substances and associated contaminated\n        materials, recycling or reuse, diversion, destruction,\n        segregation of reactive wastes, dredging or excavations,\n        repair or replacement of leaking containers, collection\n        of leachate and runoff, onsite treatment or\n        incineration, provision of alternative water supplies,\n        and any monitoring reasonably required to assure that\n        such actions protect the public health and welfare and\n        the environment.

S 9601(23), (24) (footnotes\n omitted).\n\nAs we explained in United States v. Rohm and Haas Co.,\n \"[i]n general, removal actions are short term responses to a\n release or threat of release while remedial actions involve\n long term remedies.\" 2 F.3d at 1271. Here, while appellants\n fail to recognize explicitly the distinction between\"removal\"\n and \"remedial\" actions and do not attempt to place ESI's\n consultant fees in either category, given the character of the\n costs at issue we believe that if the activities involved here\n are included within the definition of \"response costs,\" it is\n because they are \"removal\" rather than \"remedial\" actions.\n\f Cf. id. (noting that the parties agreed that if the\n government's oversight activities were deemed \"necessary\n costs of response,\" it would be because they were removal\n actions rather than remedial actions).\n\nAlthough the district court believed that ESI's consulting\n fees are best characterized as those of an \"ordinary expert\n witness,\" appellants contest that statement by indicating\n rather cryptically in their brief that ESI has been\n appellants' environmental consultant for \"fifteen years with\n respect to the Property's `detoxification,' \" and therefore\n contend that we cannot consider ESI to be an \"expert\n witness\" retained only for litigation purposes. While\n appellants fail to cite an applicable portion of the record in\n support of that statement, our review of the parties'\n submissions confirms that Cohen testified at his deposition\n that appellants had retained ESI as a consultant as early\n as 1987 or 1988. See SA at 527.\n\n                                31\n\n\n\nNevertheless, based on our study of the record, exercising\n plenary review we conclude that the district court did not\n err in concluding that ESI's consulting fees for which\n appellants seek reimbursement were litigation-related\n expenses.

See SA at 1-17.\n Obviously, inasmuch as appellants filed their complaint in\n the district court in March 1997, appellants are seeking\n reimbursement for consulting services rendered just prior\n to the time that they commenced this litigation, as well as\n reimbursement for services during the duration of the\n proceedings in the district court. The timing of the\n transactions demonstrates that the district court correctly\n concluded that ESI performed consulting services in\n anticipation of appellants instituting this litigation, and also\n performed consulting work during the pendency of this\n litigation.\n\nIn this connection, we find it significant that Cohen\n prepared an expert report for purposes of this litigation on\n behalf of ESI for appellants dated April 28, 1998, see app.\n at 412a, and that ESI correspondingly recorded a\n significant charge on its billing statement to USLR for that\n billing period. See SA at 13. The only reasonable inference\n we can draw from these circumstances is that the\n \"consulting fee\" that appellants paid to ESI for that time\n period represented, at least in significant part, ESI's\n payment for its preparation of the expert report.\n\nSecond, we note that the record reflects, and it is not\n disputed, that as appellants' environmental consultant,\n\f ESI's responsibilities were limited to reviewing Essex's\n quarterly reports it submitted to the DEP, and to providing\n appellants with a summary or analysis of Essex's progress\n in completing its remediation and detoxification efforts in\n accordance with the approved Clean-Up Plan. See app. at\n 466a; see also SA at 527. Indeed, ESI was not involved in\n\n                                33\n\n\n\nEssex's cleanup effort; it neither performed an investigation\n of the Property nor gathered data for that purpose. In our\n view, the nature of Essex's responsibilities toward its\n clients as described in the record thus confirms that it was\n retained to assess, for litigation purposes, whether Essex\n was complying with its contractual responsibility to cleanup\n the Property pursuant to the requirements set out in the\n Clean-Up Plan.\n\nMoreover, it is relevant to our analysis that Berger's\n deposition testimony, as appellants' designated Rule\n 30(b)(6) witness, is far from illuminating on the necessary\n costs of response issue. Contrary to the spirit of Rule\n 30(b)(6), Berger's evasive answers provide us with little\n assistance in determining the exact purpose for which\n appellants retained ESI, the nature of ESI's services that\n are referenced cryptically in the billing invoices in the\n record, and whether the costs incurred in relation thereto\n were the result of litigation-related consultation or were\n incurred in connection with work performed for some other\n purpose. Berger's responses clearly do not suggest that\n ESI's consulting fees were anything other than expenses\n incurred in connection with the lawsuit that appellants\n eventually might file if they were not satisfied with Essex's\n progress (and ultimately did file) against appellees. We only\n need cite the following colloquy between Essex's counsel\n and Berger, which occurred at his deposition, to illustrate\n our point:\n\n       Q: [Referring to the invoices for ESI] Mr. Berger, have\n        you ever seen those bills before?\n\n       A. I have no idea.\n\n       Q. Well, then look through them.\n\n       A. I could look through them for the next five hours\n        and I would have no idea. We've 90 properties. I get\n        bills from people. There are bills going into 1997 and\n        before. I have no idea whether I have ever seen these\n        bills or any other bills you might put in front of me\n        today.\n\fQ. Mr. Berger, other than the charges represented in\n those bills, are there any other costs that have been\n\n                         34\n\n\n\nexpended by any plaintiff for any environmental\n consulting or removal or remediation with respect to\n the Black Horse Lane property?\n\nA. I have no idea.\n\nQ. Do you know a man named Mr. Irving Cohen?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. How long have you known him?\n\nA. I would say about ten years.\n\nQ. And in what capacity do you know him?\n\nA. Mr. Cohen was the president of Enviro-Sciences. It's\n an environmental consulting firm.\n\nQ. Has that firm ever been used by [appellant] Black\n Horse Lane Associates?\n\nA. I have no idea.\n\nQ. Looking through the exhibits, if you could, could\n you tell me whether those bills appear to indicate that\n such was the case?\n\nA. These bills are--at least the ones that I can see here\n --are from Enviro-Sciences, Inc. They reference Essex\n Chem, and I will tell you that every one references\n Essex Chem, except for those that reference Black\n Horse Lane, which is the subject property of this\n lawsuit. Other than that, I can't tell you anything\n about these bills. All I'm doing is reading from the bills\n for you.\n\nQ. Turn to the bills that talk about Black Horse Lane,\n Phase One, I believe.\n\nA. There's a bill dated 10-16-97 that says `Phase One,\n Black Horse Lane.'\n\nQ. All right. To what does that bill refer?\n\nA. I don't understand the question.\n\f       Q. What does Phase One, Black Horse Lane refer to?\n\n       A. I have no idea.\n\n                                35\n\n\n\n       Q. Did you ever order a Phase One on Black Horse\n        Lane?\n\n       A. I have no idea.\n\n       Q. Do you have an understanding what the phrase\n        `Phase One' means?\n\n       A. Yes, I do.\n\n       Q. What is that?\n\n       A. It's a preliminary environmental report which\n        basically points out areas of potential environmental\n        concern.\n\n       Q. Does it include any invasive testing, as far as you\n        know?\n\n       A. Typically, no.\n\n       Q. Do you have any idea why Black Horse Lane would\n        have ordered a Phase One at or about the time period\n        for which the bill is indicated?\n\n       A. Sitting here today, I have no idea why we did or\n        didn't. I suspect if we did, in fact, order one a year ago,\n        at that point I had a reason for it, but I don't know\n        what that reason would be sitting here today. If, in\n        fact, we did order a Phase One. I don't recall that\n        either.\n\nApp. at 544a. Our review of the remainder of Berger's\n deposition testimony regarding the nature of ESI's\n consulting work for appellants confirms that he failed to\n offer any useful information concerning the factual basis for\n appellants' CERCLA response cost claim relating to the fees\n paid for ESI's services. See generally app. at 544a-49a.\n\nGiven the totality of the information in the record, we\n agree with the district court's assessment of the nature of\n ESI's consulting responsibilities to its client during the time\n period for which appellants seek reimbursement. We believe\n that the record requires the conclusion that ESI's work was\n designed to assess, for potential or actual litigation\n purposes, the extent of Essex's remediation efforts and its\n\f progress in that regard. Accordingly, ESI's consulting fees\n charged in connection with its services are not\"response\n\n                                36\n\n\n\ncosts\" that are recoverable in a private cost recovery suit\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA.12\n\nIn any event, assuming arguendo that we were to accept\n appellants' position that ESI's consulting fees were not for\n strictly \"litigation costs\" in the sense that appellants\n retained ESI's services during the relevant time period\n solely to assist them in preparing to litigate this matter, we\n nevertheless would reach the result we do, primarily for two\n reasons. First, appellants cannot reasonably deny that the\n record demonstrates that ESI's role was limited to\n evaluating Essex's progress on the cleanup effort and to\n reporting its progress (or lack thereof) to appellants. Indeed,\n it is significant that neither appellants nor ESI have played\n any role in the containment and cleanup of the Property. At\n best, it appears that ESI served as appellants'\n environmental advisor in relation to the Property, and that\n appellants simply monitored, for their own benefit, Essex's\n progress in its cleanup efforts. Given that neither ESI nor\n appellants were involved in any capacity in the actual\n environmental cleanup of the Property, it is clear that the\n fees appellants paid in connection with ESI's consulting\n work did not relate to any remedial or response action at\n the Property. As in Redland, the funds for which appellants\n seek reimbursement were not \"necessary to the\n containment and clean up of hazardous releases,\" see\n Redland, 55 F.3d at 850 (emphasis added), inasmuch as\n appellants simply had no involvement in any remedial or\n removal actions on the Property. Cf. Key Tronic Corp., 511\n U.S. at 820, 114 S.Ct. at 1967 (stating that \"some lawyers'\n _________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Again, we have not overlooked the circumstance that there are\n references in the record to the fact that Cohen performed some\n undefined environmental work for appellants prior to the dates found on\n the billing invoices in the record. See, e.g. , app. at 546a (Berger\n testifying\n that he had a \"general recollection\" that Cohen of ESI performed\n \"environmental work\" for Black Horse Lane Associates prior to February\n 14, 1997). Nevertheless, as we previously stated, the invoices submitted\n indicate that the environmental consulting for which appellants seek\n reimbursement in this cost recovery claim began in November 1996 and\n continued intermittently through May 1998. Thus, while it appears that\n ESI performed work for appellants prior to its work for which they seek\n reimbursement, that fact is irrelevant inasmuch as appellants only seek\n reimbursement for those amounts listed on the billing invoices.\n\f                                37\n\n\n\nwork that is closely tied to the actual cleanup may\n constitute a necessary cost of response in and of itself\n under the terms of S 104(a)(4)(B),\" andfinding that the\n component of claim that covers attorneys' work in\n identifying other potentially responsible parties fell within\n that category).\n\nSecond, inasmuch as ESI's role was limited to reviewing\n the manner in which Essex was performing its legal\n obligation to remediate the Property and reporting Essex's\n progress to appellants, we think it fair to characterize ESI\n as an \"overseer\" of Essex's progress on behalf of appellants.\n But our decision in Rohm & Haas precludes appellants\n from recovering such \"oversight\" costs as\"response costs\"\n pursuant to section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA. In Rohm &\n Haas, we held that the EPA could not recover from the\n statutory responsible party the cost of its \"oversight\" of the\n remedial actions performed and paid for by the private\n party. See 2 F.3d at 1278. The oversight costs the EPA\n incurred there included \"direct costs (i.e. , hiring contractors\n to provide sampling support and field investigation) and\n indirect costs (i.e., travel costs, payroll, hiring contractors to\n review [defendants'] work\"). Id. at 1269 n.4 (emphasis\n added). We stated that the \"key issue\" was whether\n CERCLA's definition of \"removal\" should be read \"to\n encompass the government's activity in overseeing a\n removal or remedial action paid for and conducted by\n private parties.\" Id. at 1275.\n\nIn reaching our conclusion, we looked to the definition of\n \"removal\" found in section 101(23) of CERCLA, and noted\n that \"[n]owhere in the definition of removal is there an\n explicit reference to oversight of activities conducted and\n paid for by a private party.\" Id. at 1275. Moreover, we\n reviewed the five categories in the definition of removal,\n with particular focus on the third of the five, i.e., \"such\n actions as may be necessary to monitor, assess, and\n evaluate the release or threat of release of hazardous\n substances,\" as the EPA argued that it was that aspect of\n the definition that applied to permit recovery of the\n oversight costs it sought. In analyzing this language, we\n rejected the EPA's argument that it supported the relief\n requested, explaining our holding as follows:\n\n                                38\n\n\n\n       Examined in a vacuum, this language could be\n       understood to encompass at least some oversight of the\n\f         activities of a private party, particularly private\n         activities focusing on assessment of the risk. On the\n         other hand, it is at least as plausible to read this\n         language as referring only to actual monitoring of a\n         release or threat of release rather than oversight of the\n         monitoring and assessment activities of others. This\n         latter reading would be consistent with an\n         understanding of the definition that distinguishes at all\n         stages--assessment, response formulation, and\n         execution--between actions taken to define the scope\n         of the risk created by a release or threatened release\n         and actions taken to evaluate the performance of\n         others to determine whether they are meeting their\n         legal obligations. We believe a reading of the statutory\n         definition that embraces this distinction is\n         linguistically the more plausible one.\n\n Id. at 1275-76. We further concluded that\"[a]ll things\n  considered, we cannot say that clause [3] of the removal\n  definition is sufficient to constitute the clear statement of\n  intent required by [National Cable Television Ass'n, Inc. v.\n  United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108977\"><a href=\"/opinion/108977/national-cable-television-assn-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">336</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108977\"><a href=\"/opinion/108977/national-cable-television-assn-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Obviously, we premised our result in Rohm & Haas on our\n  application of the NCTA doctrine, which we believed required the EPA to\n  demonstrate \"a clear statement of congressional intent\" for it to\nrecover\n  the oversight costs as response costs. See 2 F.3d at 1273, 1276. But our\n  application of the NCTA doctrine does not undermine our reliance on our\n  statutory interpretation analysis in Rohm & Haas as germane here.\n  Plainly put, we reach our result because the language of the relevant\n  statutory provisions requires that we do so. Indeed, the only plausible\n  basis for finding that appellants' oversight actions through ESI are\n  \"removal\" activities is if they fall within the third category of\n\"removal\"\n  actions, i.e., actions \"necessary to monitor, assess, and evaluate the\n  release or threat of release of hazardous substances.\" But as we\n  explained in Rohm & Haas, this language plainly refers to actual\n  monitoring, assessment or evaluation \"of a release or a threat of\nrelease.\"\n  Id. at 1275 (emphasis added). Here, ESI's oversight activities, to the\n  extent that we are willing for the sake of argument to deem them\n  monitoring, assessment or evaluation activities, were not related to the\n  release or threat of release of hazardous substances. Rather, the object\n  of ESI's reports, insofar as we can tell from the record, was to analyze\n  Essex's removal activities, including its cleanup, disposal, monitoring\n  and assessment actions, as described in its quarterly reports to the\nDEP.\n\n                                 39\n\fOur interpretation of the removal definition as excluding\n the sort of \"oversight\" costs that the EPA sought in Rohm &\n Haas compels the conclusion that appellants cannot\n recover the funds paid to ESI for its consultant work, even\n though appellants are private entities rather than a\n governmental agency. As in Rohm & Haas, appellants seek\n reimbursement from Essex, the responsible party, for costs\n appellants incurred in monitoring the responsible party's\n compliance with its legal obligations. See Rohm & Haas, 2\n F.3d at 1279 n.23 (\"The oversight costs here held to be\n non-recoverable are incurred at a different level of\n supervision. They are the costs of overseeing the\n performance of the entity that has assumed responsibility\n for the cleanup.\"). Indeed, there is no dispute in this case\n that Essex is bound contractually to complete remediation\n and detoxification of the Property, and that appellants have\n not assisted Essex in meeting its statutory and contractual\n obligations. In this sense, then, the district court was\n correct in its observation that the costs for which\n appellants seek reimbursement were not incurred as a\n result of appellants' actions in cleaning up the Property.\n\nObviously then, inasmuch as our holding in Rohm &\n Haas precludes the EPA from seeking reimbursement for\n \"oversight\" costs incurred in overseeing the performance of\n a private entity where a private party has assumed\n responsibility for the cleanup, an analysis of the scope of\n the \"removal\" definition necessarily requires us to reach the\n same result in a situation where a private party seeks\n reimbursement for overseeing another private party's legal\n obligation to cleanup a property. In short, we are satisfied\n that Congress did not intend section 107(a)(4)(B) to provide\n a private party with a cause of action against a responsible\n party for reimbursement of the party's expenses in\n retaining an environmental consultant for oversight\n purposes without direct involvement in the responsible\n party's remediation and detoxification efforts.\n\nIn sum, we are convinced that the district court correctly\n determined that appellants could not recover, pursuant to\n section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA, the monies they expended\n in consulting fees in connection with ESI's services during\n the relevant time period. We will affirm the district court's\n\n                                40\n\n\n\ndismissal of appellants' private cost recovery action pleaded\n in count III of the amended complaint.14\n\nB. District Court's Final Order of\n December 16, 1999\n\f Appellants next contend that the district court erred in\n  affirming the magistrate judge's letter opinion and order\n  entered June 30, 1999, which granted appellees' motion for\n  discovery sanctions against appellants pursuant to Rule\n  37(b) and (d).15 As we previously mentioned, the magistrate\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 14. We also will dismiss appellants' Spill Act claim under Count IV. See\n  n.11, supra. Moreover, as we previously mentioned, count V of the\n  complaint pleaded a claim for \"damages\" stemming from appellees'\n  alleged \"acts, omissions and breaches.\" App. at 66a. The district court\n  dismissed this count, stating that \"[b]ecause plaintiffs have failed to\n  adduce sufficient evidence in support of their breach of contract\nclaims,\n  they cannot recover the damages outlined in Count Five of the\n  Complaint.\" Id. at 16a. Inasmuch as we agree with the district court's\n  dismissal of counts I through IV of the complaint, we will affirm the\n  district court's dismissal of count V, as there is no independent\n  substantive basis for appellants' claim for relief.\n\n 15. Appellants also maintain that the district court erred in dismissing\n  appellees' counterclaim without prejudice. The counterclaim sought a\n  declaratory judgment that remediation of the Property under the\n  Agreement included use of \"engineering and institutional controls,\" and\n  an order requiring appellants to consent to them. App. at 80a-81a.\n  Appellees explain that their counterclaim actually sought an order\n  compelling appellants to consent to their use of a Classification\n  Exception Area (\"CEA\"), which is \"a remediation by passive rather than\n  active means.\" App. at 845a.\n\n As we previously mentioned, appellants initially sought partial\n   summary judgment to dismiss the counterclaim with prejudice, but the\n   district court denied their motion in its order of August 10, 1999,\n   reasoning that appellants failed to demonstrate that they were entitled\nto\n   judgment as a matter of law. The court observed that appellants failed\n   to cite any authority in support of the motion, and\"merely allege[d]\nthat\n   `Plaintiffs do not and need not consent' to the engineering and\n   institutional controls.\" App. at 16. After the court dismissed the\n   amended complaint in its entirety, appellees moved for summary\n   judgment on the counterclaim. After oral argument on appellees' motion,\n   the court entered an order dismissing the counterclaim without\n\n                                 41\n\n\n\n judge agreed with appellees' argument that Berger's\n  conduct warranted a sanction in the form of precluding\n  appellants from asserting a position and introducing\n  evidence contrary to the position Berger asserted during his\n  deposition. In addition, the magistrate judge concluded that\n\f  Berger's lack of preparedness at his deposition justified the\n  imposition of monetary sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d) in\n  the form of costs and attorney's fees associated with taking\n  the deposition and bringing the sanctions motion before the\n  court. App. at 22a. The magistrate judge clearly set forth\n  the factual and legal basis for his ruling, relying primarily\n  on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's decision in\n  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Southern Union Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n  (5th Cir. 1993) (\"Southern Union\"):\n\n        Here, Berger was not completely prepared on any\n         occasion for which he sat for a deposition. Further, his\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n prejudice, because, in its view, there was no current case or controversy\n  with respect to the subject matter of the counterclaim.\n\n We have reviewed the entire record, and we agree with the district\n  court's disposition of the counterclaim. It appears that the appellees\n  instituted the counterclaim in response to certain statements by\n  appellants to the effect that they would not consent to the use of a CEA\n  to remediate the Property, and would oppose any application that Essex\n  made to the DEP for that purpose. Appellees' br. at 14. Nevertheless,\nthe\n  court's dismissal of the counterclaim was appropriate because appellees\n  do not dispute that Essex has not applied for a CEA, and presently\n  cannot do so. Accordingly, appellants' threats to the effect that they\n  would not consent to the use of a CEA do not present a controversy ripe\n  for resolution, and the court did not err in dismissing the counterclaim\n  without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

Additionally, Berger's actions\n       are magnified by his status as a member of the Bar.\n\nApp. at 21a.\n\nIn affirming the magistrate judge's order, the district\n court provided its reasons on the record:\n\n       I read the record. It is appalling. It is appalling.\n\n       [Berger] did nothing except show his face only under\n       the threat of court orders. When he showed up, he\n       knew he was a 30(b)(6) witness and, notwithstanding\n       the fact that he knew he was a 30(b)(6) witness, he\n       refused to answer questions in an intelligent way. He\n       refused to prepare, as you are required to prepare\n       under 30(b)(6), to intelligently answer questions and\n       just literally thumbed his nose at the defendants and,\n       frankly, at the Court.\n\n       . . . .\n\n       I'm satisfied, based upon my review of the record--and\n        I defy anyone to look at the record here which was\n        created by Mr. Berger--that the actions taken by[the\n        magistrate judge] were well within his discretion and\n        do not constitute either an abuse of discretion or are\n        they contrary to law or shocking to the conscience of\n        the Court.\n\n                                43\n\n\n\n       One, in order to come to that conclusion, one must\n       live in the shoes of [the magistrate judge] in trying to\n       conduct orderly discovery in this matter.\n\n       One must review meticulously the record of\n       noncompliance by Mr. Berger in this matter.\n\n       [The magistrate judge] did not issue this opinion\n       lightly. [The magistrate judge] was fully cognizant of\n\f         the totality of the facts surrounding this matter, which\n         border upon almost conscious disregard of the Court\n         and the court rules. . . .\n\n        Affirmed.\n\n App. at 836a, 843a-44a.\n\n Appellants make two arguments in support of their\n  request to vacate the monetary sanctions order. 16 They first\n  claim that the district court abused its discretion in\n  affirming the magistrate judge's monetary sanctions\n  because the court misunderstood the requirements for\n\n  imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 37(d). They assert\n  that Rule 37 required as a prerequisite to imposing a\n  monetary sanction that the court first issue an order\n  compelling appellants to supply the requested discovery\n  responses, and then find that they failed to do so. See\n  Reply Br. at 29. They further claim that pursuant to Rule\n  37(d), \"a party making a motion based upon an alleged\n  violation of Rule 37(d) must certify that the movant has in\n  good faith conferred or attempted to confer with the party\n  failing to answer or respond in an effort to obtain such\n  answer or response without court action,\" but that there\n  was no such \"good faith\" effort by appellees to resolve the\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 16. Appellants also claim that the court abused its discretion in\ngranting\n  appellees' motion pursuant to Rule 37(b) to the extent that it precluded\n  appellants from asserting at trial a position which differs from\nBerger's\n  testimony. Given that we are affirming the summary judgment\n  dismissing the amended complaint in its entirety, we need not address\n  this argument. Also, appellants apparently contend that the court erred\n  in awarding a monetary sanction pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2). This\n  argument is without merit, as it is clear to us that the court awarded\n  attorney's fees and costs pursuant to subdivision (d) of Rule 37 rather\n  than subdivision (b). See App. at 22a (citing Rule 37(d)).\n\n                                 44\n\n\n\n dispute without court action. Reply Br. at 30 (internal\n  quotation marks omitted).\n\n Finally, they rely on the fact that Rule 37(d) states that\n  sanctions may be imposed when a party, inter alia, \"fails\n  . . . to appear before the officer who is to take the\n  deposition, after being served with a proper notice.\" Here,\n  they argue that we should apply the \"fails to appear\"\n  language literally, and that sanctions were inappropriate in\n\f     this case because Berger appeared for his deposition after\n     the magistrate judge's October 15, 1998 order and\"testified\n     under oath for more than seventeen hours.\" Br. at 59-60. In\n     support of their literal reading of Rule 37(d), they rely\n     primarily on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's\n     opinion in R.W. International Corp. v. Welsh Foods, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563789\"><a href=\"/opinion/563789/rw-international-corp-and-t-h-ward-de-la-cruz-inc-v-welch-foods/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span>\n     <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1991), which stated that \"Rule 37(d)\n     sanctions apply only when a deponent `literally fails to\n     show up for a deposition session.' \" Id. at 15 n.2 (quoting\n     Salahuddin v.

They claim that\n  even if we agree with the magistrate judge's finding that\n  Rule 37(d) could support the imposition of sanctions when\n  a Rule 30(b)(6) witness provides inadequate and evasive\n  answers, the record demonstrates that Berger's deposition\n  did not present a situation warranting sanctions. They\n  claim that \"[a] fair examination of the transcript of Mr.\n  Berger's 570-page deposition confirms that Mr. Berger\n  testified fully and in good faith in response to Defendants'\n  questioning.\" In any event, they maintain that\"any\n  `violation' of Rule 30(b)(6) which might be said to have\n  existed was minimal, and indeed, paled in comparison with\n  the extraordinarily broad discovery obtained by Defendants\n  in this matter.\" Br. at 63.\n\n We are not persuaded by either contention. Beginning\n  with appellants' interpretation of the language of Rule 37(d),17\n  _________________________________________________________________\n\n 17. Rule 37(d) provides:\n\n          (d) Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers\n     to\n           Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection.

Importantly, in Southern\n Union the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rejected a\n literal interpretation of Rule 37(d) in situations where\n the uncooperative deponent is a party's Rule 30(b)(6)\n designated witness.\n\nIn Southern Union the defendant Southern Union Co.\n (\"Southern Union\") served notice on the RTC that it\n intended to depose it pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6), and set\n forth with specificity ten discrete topics with which the\n deponent was to be familiar. After the RTC designated two\n individuals as Rule 30(b)(6) deponents, Southern Union's\n representatives traveled from Washington, D.C. to Dallas,\n Texas, to conduct the depositions. Neither representative,\n however, possessed any knowledge relevant to the matters\n designated in the Rule 30(b)(6) notice. Consequently,\n Southern Union moved for sanctions, and the district court\n granted the motion, awarding costs and fees incurred in\n deposing the RTC's two witnesses and in identifying\n ultimately the proper deponent with knowledge of the\n relevant facts. See id. at 196-97.\n\nRelying upon the Court of Appeals for the Second\n Circuit's opinion in Salahuddin, a case cited subsequently\n in Welsh Foods, the RTC contended that sanctions\n pursuant to Rule 37(d) were not appropriate because both\n witnesses literally appeared for their depositions, albeit that\n\n                                47\n\n\n\nneither was helpful or forthcoming with pertinent\n information. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\n\f rejected that argument, reasoning:\n\n       Were we here faced with a case involving the deposition\n        of a natural person we might be inclined to agree with\n        the reading of Rule 37(d) by our Second Circuit\n        colleagues [in Salahuddin]. The deposition of a\n        corporation, however, poses a different problem, as\n        reflected by Rule 30(b)(6). Rule 30(b)(6) streamlines the\n        discovery process. It places the burden of identifying\n        responsive witnesses for a corporation on the\n        corporation. Obviously, this presents a potential for\n        abuse which is not extant where the party noticing the\n        deposition specifies the deponent. When a corporation\n        or association designates a person to testify on its\n        behalf, the corporation appears vicariously through\n        that agent. If that agent is not knowledgeable about\n        relevant facts, and the principal has failed to designate\n        an available, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable\n        witness, then the appearance is, for all practical\n        purposes, no appearance at all.\n\n       In the instant case, RTC possessed documents that\n       clearly identified [the eventual deponent] as having\n       personal knowledge of the subject of the deposition.\n       RTC did not furnish those documents or designate\n       [that deponent] until after it had designated Perry and\n       Wieting, obliged Southern Union's counsel to travel\n       from Washington, D.C. to Dallas for a useless\n       deposition, and been served with Southern Union's\n       motion for sanctions. The finding that RTC did not\n       make a meaningful effort to acquit its duty to designate\n       an appropriate witness is manifest. The district court\n       did not abuse its discretion in awarding fees and costs\n       under Rule 37(d).\n\nId. at 197-98.\n\nFollowing the reasoning in Southern Union, several courts\n similarly have read the phrase \"fails . . . to appear\" in Rule\n 37(d) pragmatically in light of the purposes of Rule 30(b)(6)\n and the parties' obligations thereunder.

Indeed, we believe that the\n purpose behind Rule 30(b)(6) undoubtedly is frustrated in\n the situation in which a corporate party produces a witness\n who is unable and/or unwilling to provide the necessary\n factual information on the entity's behalf. See generally\n Fed. R. Civ.

To the contrary, our review of Berger's deposition\n testimony in its entirety confirms the observations of both\n the magistrate judge and the district court on this point.\n Indeed, throughout his lengthy deposition, Berger failed to\n offer meaningful testimony about most, if not all, of the\n items specified in the notice of deposition. While we need\n not recite every instance in which Berger's testimony was\n incomplete and unhelpful on the specified topics, we believe\n that two examples of his uncooperative attitude and his\n flagrant disregard for his obligation as a Rule 30(b)(6)\n witness amply illustrate our point.\n\fFirst, when Berger was asked about the Agreement he\n signed between USLR and Essex, he stated that he had no\n recollection of (1) seeing or signing the Agreement, (2)\n negotiating the Agreement (or who participated in its\n negotiation), (3) drafting the various provisions in the\n Agreement (or who participated in its drafting), or (4) the\n circumstances surrounding the purchase of the Property,\n i.e., if he attended the closing and where it occurred, even\n though he admitted that he was personally involved in the\n purchase of the Property and \"probably negotiated the\n contract.\" See app. at 525a. Second, when asked about any\n and all cleanup costs appellants' incurred as a result of the\n contamination on the Property, Berger testified that he did\n not know: (1) whether appellants spent any money to\n cleanup hazardous waste; (2) whether appellants performed\n any environmental evaluation or investigation on the\n Property, whether they incurred costs in doing so, and\n whether there are any records that such tests were\n performed; (3) whether appellants hired ESI to perform\n consulting services for the Property, and if so, the dates\n and purposes for which appellants retained ESI; (4)\n whether ESI's billing statements in the record reflected\n work performed on the Property or other unrelated services;\n\n                                51\n\n\n\nand (5) whether appellants performed any removal or\n remedial actions on the Property. App. at 521a, 523-25a,\n 544a-49a.\n\nObviously, as appellants' Rule 30(b)(6) witness, Berger\n should have been prepared to discuss these and other\n topics designated in the notice of deposition. Instead, he\n divulged as little information as possible in every area that\n appellees identified. Moreover, Berger's uncooperative\n attitude is demonstrated further by statements in which he\n claimed that he was unaware that he was appellants'\n designated Rule 30(b)(6) representative, did not know what\n the phrase \"Rule 30(b)(6) representative\" meant, and was\n not familiar with Rule 30(b)(6) or what it required him to\n do. App. at 513a-14a, 527a, 544a. He also admitted at one\n point that he did not recall whether he reviewed the notice\n of deposition prior to the date of the deposition, app. at\n 527a, and later stated clearly that he had not bothered to\n read it at all. App. at 610. Simply put, we find his professed\n ignorance on these points particularly unconvincing given\n that he obtained undergraduate and law degrees from\n prestigious universities and has been licensed to practice\n law since \"either [19]65 or [19]66.\" App. at 508a.\n\nIn any event, we believe that the magistrate judge's\n finding that Berger engaged in discovery abuses plainly is\n\f justified on this record. The magistrate judge had ample\n evidence of Berger's failure to cooperate, which in turn\n rendered his deposition a virtual non-event. Accordingly, we\n will affirm the monetary sanctions ordered pursuant to\n Rule 37(d).\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court's orders of\n August 10, 1999, and December 16, 1999, will be affirmed.\n\nA True Copy:\n Teste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n        for the Third Circuit\n\n                                52\n\f</pre>",
