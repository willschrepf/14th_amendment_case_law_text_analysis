Plaintif fs, a group\nof African-Americans, brought a civil rights action,\ncontending that, with this knowledge, defendant tobacco\ncompanies have targeted the marketing of mentholated\ntobacco products at African-Americans.\n\nPlaintiffs, who designate themselves the \"Black Smokers,\"\nare the Rev. Jesse Brown, the Uptown Coalition for Tobacco\nControl and Healing, Aaron Eleazar , Pansy Smith, Ellen\nIrving, and the National Association of African Americans\nfor Positive Imagery, Inc. They brought this civil rights\naction on behalf of a class of all living Black Americans who\nhave, since 1954, purchased or consumed mentholated\n\n                               4\n\ftobacco products. They named as defendants the tobacco\ncompanies: Philip Morris, Inc., R.J. Reynolds T obacco\nCompany, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, Br own &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corporation, B.A.T . Industries, the\nAmerican Tobacco Company, Lorillard T obacco Company,\nInc., Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, Liggett Group Inc.\nand United States Tobacco Company; the non-pr ofit\norganizations supported by the tobacco-industry: the\nTobacco Institute, Inc., the Council for T obacco Research --\nU.S.A., Inc., and Smokeless Tobacco Council, Inc.; and the\npublic relations firm Hill & Knowlton, Inc. Black Smokers\ncontend that each of the defendants has unlawfully\nengaged in targeted marketing and sales of mentholated\ntobacco products to African-Americans on the basis of their\nrace in violation of the civil rights statutes codified at 42\nU.S.C. SS 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1985(3). Black Smokers\nalso assert a cause of action against defendants under\nBivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents , 403 U.S.\n388, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (1971), and the Fifth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution, arguing that defendants should\nbe considered federal actors by virtue of the federal\nregulatory scheme to which the tobacco industry is subject.\n\nThe District Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim. We will affirm that decision. We\nagree with the District Court that Black Smokers'\nallegations of racially targeted marketing of mentholated\ntobacco products cannot, in the absence of any disparity\nbetween the products sold to African-Americans and the\nproducts sold to others, constitute a deprivation of contract\nor property rights actionable under SS 1981 or 1982. We\nalso concur with the District Court that ther e is no\nallegation that defendants are state actors to support the\nS 1983 claim and that defendants cannot be r egarded as\nfederal actors as is required to maintain the claims under\nBivens and the Fifth Amendment. Although we agree with\nthe District Court that Black Smokers failed to state a\nclaim under S 1985(3), we need not reach the further\nquestion whether SS 1981 and 1982 claims can, as a matter\nof law, support a claim under S 1985(3). As the District\nCourt noted, even assuming arguendo that Black Smokers\ncould properly premise a S 1985(3) cause of action on a\n\n                               5\n\fviolation of SS1981 and 1982, they have failed to state a\nclaim under SS 1981 and 1982.\n\nI. FACTS\n\nIn their Second Amended Complaint, Black Smokers\nallege that the defendants have unlawfully tar geted African-\nAmericans with billboard, magazine, and other types of\nadvertising in order to promote the sale to and\nconsumption by African-Americans of various mentholated\ntobacco products. It is not disputed that the tobacco\nindustry has designed certain menthol cigarettes\nspecifically to appeal to African-American consumers,\nincluding R.J. Reynolds' \"Uptown,\" a high tar , high nicotine\nmenthol cigarette.1 Black Smokers contend, and defendants\ndo not dispute, that medical research has demonstrated\nthat mentholated tobacco products pose gr eater health\nrisks than non-mentholated ones, including an incr eased\nincidence of cancers of the lung and pharynx. It is not\ndisputed that, although African-Americans account for only\n10.3% of the U.S. population, they account for a\nsignificantly greater share of menthol cigarette smokers.\nBlack Smokers cite reports fixing the per centage of African-\nAmerican menthol smokers at, variously, 31%, 61.5% and\n66%. Apparently relying upon the 31% figure, defendants\nclaim that a significant majority (69%) of menthol cigarette\nsmokers are not African-Americans and that Black\nSmokers admit that fact. In addition to the allegation of\nracially targeted marketing, Black Smokers also charge\ndefendants with \"intentional racial discrimination\" and a\n\"conspiracy of deception and misrepr esentation against the\nAfrican American public.\"\n\nBlack Smokers also accuse defendants of \"a massive\nconspiracy to mislead the Black American public r egarding\nthe safety of menthol tobacco products.\" Black Smokers\nidentify three courses of conduct underlying the purported\nconspiracy: \"(1) acting in concert to repr esent falsely that\ntheir menthol tobacco products are safe for African\nAmericans to use; (2) engaging in a concerted campaign to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The Uptown brand was withdrawn from the market by R.J. Reynolds\nin 1990 as a result of negative national publicity.\n\n                               6\n\fsaturate the African American community with danger ous,\ndefective and hazardous tobacco products, which Tobacco\nIndustry knew caused harm, in violation of the civil and\nconstitutional rights of African Americans; and (3)\nmisrepresenting, suppressing, distorting, and confusing the\ntruth about the health dangers of mentholated tobacco\nproducts.\" Notwithstanding these allegations, Black\nSmokers apparently concede in their opening appellate brief\nthat African-Americans demonstrated their pr eference for\nmenthol cigarettes before defendants initiated targeted\nadvertising. In their reply brief and at oral argument,\nhowever, Black Smokers denied making such a concession\nand asserted that defendants created the African-American\npreference for menthol cigarettes. Black Smokers did not\nallege in their opening appellate brief that defendants\ninterfere with the right of African-Americans to purchase\nnon-menthol cigarettes or that menthol cigar ettes are not\nmarketed and sold to persons other than African-\nAmericans. However, in their reply brief and at oral\nargument, Black Smokers made the surprising statement\nthat they \"do not concede that Black Americans ar e free to\npurchase non-menthol cigarettes.\"\n\nBlack Smokers do not contend that the menthol\ncigarettes marketed and sold to African-Americans are\nthemselves different from those sold to whites or other\npersons. Additionally, Black Smokers do not aver that\nAfrican-Americans receive information about menthol\ncigarettes that differs in any respect from the information\nprovided to others. However, in their r eply brief and at oral\nargument, Black Smokers made another surprising claim --\nthat while defendants suggest to African-Americans in\nadvertising that menthol cigarettes are healthier than non-\nmenthol cigarettes, are of high quality, enhance the\nsmoker's image, and are glamorous, pr estigious and\nsocially acceptable, \"none of these sales messages or terms\nare targeted to white consumers.\" Black Smokers agree,\nhowever, that defendants have employed tar geted marketing\n(e.g., advertising using African-American models and\nathletes) to sell non-menthol cigarettes such as Camel,\nLucky Strike, Kent and Eve. In addition, no party to the\ninstant litigation alleges that defendants pr ovide any\nconsumers with warnings concerning the additional health\n\n                               7\n\frisks posed by menthol cigarettes in comparison to non-\nmentholated tobacco products.\n\nBlack Smokers filed this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on\nOctober 19, 1998. A month later, Black Smokers filed a\nFirst Amended Class Action Complaint correcting the\ncaption. By leave of the court, Black Smokers filed a\nSecond Amended Complaint on December 9, 1998, in or der\nto add claims purportedly arising under the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nand 42 U.S.C. S 1985(3). On January 8, 1999, defendants\nfiled a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.\nThe District Court granted the motion to dismiss on\nSeptember 23, 1999. Jesse Brown et al. v. Philip Morris,\nInc., et al., No. Civ. A. 98-5518, 1999 WL 783712 (E.D. Pa.\nSept. 22, 1999). Black Smokers filed a timely Notice of\nAppeal on October 19, 1999.\n\nII. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nThe District Court had subject matter jurisdiction\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. SS 1331, 1343(a)(1), (3) and (4), and\n1332. We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\nS 1291. We exercise plenary r eview over the District Court's\ndismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim\npursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). Gallas v. Supreme Court\nof Pennsylvania, 211 F.3d 760, 768 (3d Cir. 2000). We must\naccept as true all of the factual allegations in the complaint\nas well as the reasonable inferences that can be drawn\nfrom them. Moore v. Tartler, 986 F.2d 682, 685 (3d Cir.\n1993). We may dismiss the complaint only if it is clear that\nno relief could be granted under any set of facts that could\nbe proved consistent with the allegations. Hishon v. King &\nSpaulding, 476 U.S. 69, 73, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 81 L.Ed.2d 59\n(1984).\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\n\nA. REGULATING TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\nA brief summary of the federal regulation of the tobacco\nindustry is a necessary prerequisite to a discussion of\n\n                                 8\n\fBlack Smokers' civil rights claims. Manufactur ers of\ncigarettes are subject to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and\nAdvertising Act of 1965 and its successor, the Public Health\nCigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 15 U.S.C. S 1331, et seq.\n(together, the Labeling Act). The Labeling Act provides a\ncomprehensive program of federal r equirements addressing\nthe labeling and advertising of cigarettes and preempts\ncertain state law damages actions relating to smoking and\nhealth which challenge the adequacy of warnings on\ncigarette packages or the propriety of a manufacturer's\nadvertising or promotion of cigarettes. See Cipollone v.\nLiggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 511, 112 S.Ct. 2608\n(1992). In Cipollone, the Supreme Court was called upon to\ndetermine the contours of the federal pr eemption of state\nlaw actions under the Labeling Act. The Court held that (i)\nthe 1965 Act does not preempt state law damages actions\nin general; (ii) the 1969 Act does preempt claims based on\na failure to warn and on the neutralization of federally\nmandated warnings to the extent that such claims rely on\nomissions or inclusions in a manufacturer's advertising or\npromotions; and (iii) the 1969 Act does not pr eempt claims\nbased on express warranty, intentional fraud and\nmisrepresentation, or conspiracy. See Cipollone v. Liggett,\n505 U.S. at 530-31.\n\nB. CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS: SECTIONS 1981 AND 1982\n\nSection 1981, which prohibits racial discrimination in the\nmaking and enforcement of contracts and pr operty\ntransactions, provides:\n\n       All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States\n       shall have the same right in every State and T erritory\n       to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give\n       evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws\n       and proceedings for the security of persons and\n       property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n       subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes,\n       licenses and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1981(a). Section 1981 is derived from the Civil\nRights Act of 1866 and from the reenactment of Section 1\nof the 1866 Act in 1870. Mahone v. Waddle , 564 F.2d 1018,\n\n                                9\n\f1030 (3d Cir. 1977), citing Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.\n160, 168-70 & n.8; Civil Rights Act of 1866, ch. 31, section\nI, 14 Stat. 27, reenacted, Civil Rights Act of 1870, ch. 114\nSS 16, 18, 16 Stat. 144, codified at 42 U.S.C. SS 1981, 1982.\nThe legislative history of the 1866 Act makes clear\nCongress's intent to enact \"sweeping legislation\nimplementing the thirteenth amendment to abolish all the\nremaining badges and vestiges of the slavery system.\"\nMahone v. Waddle, 564 F.2d at 1030. As a result, the\ncurrent statute rests not only on the Fourteenth\nAmendment but also on the Thirteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. at 190 (Stevens,\nJ., concurring).\n\nSection 1982, which prohibits racial discrimination in\ntransactions relating to real and personal property,\nprovides:\n\n       All citizens of the United States shall have the same\n       right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by\n       white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell,\n       hold, and convey real and personal property.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1982. Like S 1981, S 1982 is a Reconstruction\nstatute enacted to effectuate the aims of the Thirteenth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Because of\nthe historic interrelationship between the two statutes,\ncourts have consistently construed them together . See\nSaunders v. General Services Corp., 659 F .Supp. 1042,\n1063 (E.D. Va. 1987), citing Tillman v. Wheaton-Haven\nRecreation Association, 410 U.S. 431 (1973); McCrary v.\nRunyon, 427 U.S. 160 (1976).\n\nAlthough not identical, the requisite elements of claims\nunder SS 1981 and 1982 are quite similar . In neither case\nneed a plaintiff allege state action on the part of the\ndefendant. See Stirgus v. Benoit, 720 F.Supp. 119 (N.D. Ill.\n1989) (S 1982). In order to state a claim under S 1981, a\nplaintiff \"must allege facts in support of the following\nelements: (1) [that plaintiff] is a member of a racial\nminority; (2) intent to discriminate on the basis of race by\nthe defendant; and (3) discrimination concer ning one or\nmore of the activities enumerated in the statute[,] which\nincludes the right to make and enforce contracts. . . .\"\n\n                               10\n\fYelverton v. Lehman, No. Civ. A. 94-6114, 1996 WL 296551,\nat *7 (E.D. Pa. June 3, 1996), aff 'd mem., 175 F.3d 1012\n(3d Cir. 1999). In order to bring an action under S 1982, a\nplaintiff \"must allege with specificity facts sufficient to show\nor raise a plausible inference of 1) the defendant's racial\nanimus; (2) intentional discrimination; and 3) that the\ndefendant deprived plaintiff of his rights because of race.\"\nGarg v. Albany Indus. Dev. Agency, 899 F . Supp. 961, 968\n(N.D.N.Y. 1995), aff 'd, 104 F.3d 351 (Table), 1996 WL\n547184 (2d Cir. Sept. 26, 1996). See also Shaare Tefila\nCongregation v. Cobb, 481 U.S. 615, 616-17, 107 S.Ct.\n2019 (1987).\n\nAccepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint, we\nconclude that Black Smokers have not alleged a claim\ncognizable under either S 1981 or S 1982. Black Smokers do\nnot make the sort of claim that is most readily actionable\nunder the statute: that they have been deprived by\ndefendants of the right to contract for, pur chase, own or\nuse either menthol or non-menthol cigarettes. Black\nSmokers do not aver that defendants have engaged in a\ndiscriminatory refusal to deal with African-Americans with\nrespect to either menthol or non-menthol cigar ettes. Nor do\nBlack Smokers claim that defendants have dealt with\ncustomers on differing terms on the basis of race; Black\nSmokers concede that defendants sell menthol cigar ettes to\nAfrican-Americans at the same price and on the same\nterms as such products are of fered to whites. Significantly,\nBlack Smokers do not allege that the mentholated tobacco\nproducts sold to African-Americans differ from those sold to\nwhites. Furthermore, at no place in their submissions do\nBlack Smokers argue any disparities with r espect to the\nmarketing or sales of non-menthol tobacco pr oducts on the\nbasis of race. Consequently, it is difficult to understand\nBlack Smokers' allegations to constitute a deprivation of\ncontract or property rights actionable underSS 1981 or\n1982. Indeed, Black Smokers' complaint appears instead to\npresent quite the opposite situation. Defendants are alleged\nto encourage the consumption by African-Americans of\ncertain of their products: mentholated cigar ettes, snuff, and\nchewing tobacco.\n\nThe question at the heart of Black Smokers' SS 1981 and\n1982 claims, then, is whether such encouragement is\n\n                               11\n\funlawful under the civil rights statutes. At the outset, we\nnote that neither party has alerted us to the existence of\nany authority standing for the proposition that an\nencouragement to deal is actionable under such statutes.\nSome authority does exist in support of the notion that\ntargeting consumers for sales of defective pr oducts on the\nbasis of race is actionable under SS 1981 and 1982. For\nexample, in Roper v. Edwards, 815 F .2d 1474 (11th Cir.\n1987), a case cited by Black Smokers, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit suggests that a cause of action\nunder S1981 exists where a burial vault manufacturer\nmade targeted sales of defective burial vaults to Black\nconsumers. Although the case was brought by white\nplaintiffs who were inadvertently sold a defective vault, and\nalthough the Court of Appeals ultimately rejected plaintiffs'\nclaims on other grounds, Black Smokers corr ectly argue\nthat the Eleventh Circuit did not reject the cause of action.\nNevertheless, Roper is readily distinguishable from the case\nat bar because unlike Roper, which involved deceptive sales\nto African-Americans of products that dif fered from those\nsold to whites, this case concerns identical products;\ndefendants sell the same menthol cigarettes to everyone.\n\nOne might argue that if racially directed marketing of\nmenthol cigarettes resulted in a situation in which virtually\nall mentholated tobacco products were consumed by\nAfrican-Americans and substantially all non-mentholated\ntobacco products by others, that case might come within\nthe sweep of Roper. However, Black Smokers have not\nalleged such a situation.\n\nIn order to salvage their S 1981 claims, Black Smokers\nresort to several alternative theories of recovery. First, they\nsuggest that defendants' advertisements for menthol\ncigarettes constitute express warranties containing\nmisrepresentations and false statements. This argument\nseems to constitute a claim of breach of expr ess warranty,\nintentional fraud or misrepresentation. Although it is true\nthat the Labeling Act does not preempt such an action,\nCipollone v. Liggett, 505 U.S. at 526-529, 530-31, Black\nSmokers fail to make sufficiently detailed allegations with\nrespect to any of these potential causes of action. Black\nSmokers imply in their submissions, and asserted at oral\n\n                               12\n\fargument, that defendants fail to disclose the increased\nhealth risks of menthol cigarettes and that the African-\nAmerican community suffers damages as a r esult of its\nhigher consumption of mentholated tobacco pr oducts.\nAlthough that claim may be factually true, it is not\nactionable. The Supreme Court has held that the 1969 Act\npreempts claims based on a failure to war n and on the\nneutralization of federally mandated warnings to the extent\nthat such claims rely on omissions or inclusions in\nadvertising or promotions. Cipollone v. Liggett, 505 U.S.\n504, 530-531.\n\nSecond, Black Smokers attempt to raise a claim of\nsegregated market exploitation by arguing that defendants'\npractices fall within the ambit of segregated housing cases\nsuch as Clark v. Universal Builders, Inc., 501 F.2d 324 (7th\nCir. 1973). This claim also fails on both factual and legal\ngrounds. In the segregated housing cases, unlike the\ninstant case, the defendants sold houses to Black\npurchasers on substantially differ ent and more onerous\nterms than to others, effectively cr eating two separate,\nracially-segregated markets. See, e.g., Clark v. Universal\nBuilders, 501 F.2d at 328. Black Smokers, however, point\nto no such disparities in the sale of mentholated tobacco\nproducts, apart from the generalized allegation that African-\nAmericans are more likely than others to buy mentholated\ntobacco products as a result of tar geted advertising.\n\nMoreover, even if Black Smokers' segr egated market\nexploitation claims were cognizable on the facts alleged, we\nmust reject them on procedural grounds. It does not appear\nthat Black Smokers advanced such claims in the District\nCourt; arguments asserted for the first time on appeal are\ndeemed to be waived and consequently are not susceptible\nof review in this Court absent exceptional cir cumstances\n(e.g., the public interest requir es that the issues be heard\nor manifest injustice would result from the failure to\nconsider such issues). See, e.g., United States v. Anthony\nDell'acquilla Enter. & Subsidiaries, 150 F.3d 329, 335 (3d\nCir. 1998) (citations omitted); United Parcel Serv. Inc. v.\nInternational Brotherhood of T eamsters, 55 F.3d 138, 140\nn.5 (3d Cir. 1995). No such exceptional cir cumstances are\napparent here.\n\n                               13\n\fThird, Black Smokers assert that defendants' targeted\nmarketing practices violate the \"full and equal benefit\"\nclause of S1981, which provides that \"[a]ll persons within\nthe jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\nright in every State and Territory . . . to the full and equal\nbenefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\npersons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens . . ..\"\n42 U.S.C. S 1981(a). Again, we must reject Black Smokers'\n\"full and equal benefit\" claims because they do not appear\nto have been raised in the District Court and no exceptional\ncircumstances suggest review of such claims\nnotwithstanding Black Smokers' failure to ar gue them\npreviously. United States v. Anthony Dell'acquilla Enter. &\nSubsidiaries, 150 F.3d at 335 (citations omitted). Moreover,\neven if we were to consider them, such \"full and equal\nbenefit\" claims would fail in light of a substantial line of\nauthority holding that only state actors can be sued under\nthe \"full and equal benefit\" clause of S1981. Mahone v.\nWaddle, 563 F.2d 1018, 1029 (3d Cir. 1977); Sheppard v.\nDickstein, Shapiro, Morin & Oshinsky, 59 F.Supp.2d 27, 30\nn.1 (D.D.C. 1999) (dictum); Lewis v. J.C. Penney Co., 948\nF.Supp. 367, 371 (D.Del. 1996) (citations omitted); Sterling\nv. Kazmierczak, 983 F.Supp. 1186, 1192 (N.D. Ill. 1997). As\nwe explain in Sections III C and D, infra, the defendants in\nthe instant case cannot be regarded as federal or state\nactors.\n\nNotwithstanding Black Smokers' arguments to the\ncontrary, their complaints essentially constitute\ndiscriminatory advertising claims. Black Smokers virtually\nadmit as much when they characterize their claims as\nallegations of discriminatory targeting in sales of allegedly\ndefective products. Although Black Smokers ar gue that\ntheir claims resemble racial profiling and racially-motivated\nprepayment cases, all such fact patterns are\ndistinguishable from the instant case because they involve\neither a naked, racially-motivated restriction on dealing or\na race-based variation of the terms of the contract at issue.\nConsequently, Black Smokers' claims remain\nfundamentally allegations of discriminatory advertising and\nare not therefore cognizable underSS 1981 or 1982.\n\nEven in the context of housing discrimination -- arguably\na paradigmatic example of the rights Congress sought to\n\n                               14\n\fprotect under the Civil Rights Acts -- ample authority\nexists in support of the proposition that discriminatory\nadvertising is not actionable under SS 1981 and 1982. See\nJones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 413, 88 S.Ct.\n2186 (1968) (noting that S1982 does not pr ohibit\n\"advertising or other representations that indicate\ndiscriminatory preferences\"); Span v. Colonial Village, Inc.,\n899 F.2d 24, 35 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (holding that SS 1981 and\n1982 do not prohibit real estate advertisements indicating\ndiscriminatory preferences); Saunders v. General Services\nCorp., 659 F.Supp. 1042 (E.D. Va. 1987) (declining to apply\nSS 1981 or 1982 to racially discriminatory advertising for\nrental housing); Ragin v. Steiner, Clateman and Assocs.,\n714 F.Supp. 709, 713 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (same in context of\ncooperative apartment complex).\n\nC. SECTION 1983\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1983 provides a cause of action against any\n\"person who, under color of any statute, or dinance,\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State or T erritory or\nthe District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be\nsubjected\" any person to the deprivation of any right\nprotected by federal law or the United States Constitution.\nUnlike SS 1981 and 1982, S 1983 is derived from the Civil\nRights Act of 1871, which was enacted to enfor ce the\nFourteenth Amendment. Mahone v. Waddle , 564 F.2d 1018,\n1031 (3d Cir. 1977). Moreover, the Act of 1871, unlike the\nAct of 1866, is addressed only to the state and to those\nacting under color of state authority. Id. (citations omitted).\nIt is well established that liability under S 1983 will not\nattach for actions taken under color of federal law. Bethea\nv. Reid, 445 F.2d 1163, 1164 (3d Cir . 1971). In light of the\nfact that Black Smokers have not alleged that defendants\nare state, rather than federal actors, the District Court\nproperly granted defendants' motion to dismiss as to Black\nSmokers' S 1983 claims.\n\nD. THE BIVENS AND FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS\n\nThe controlling question with respect to Black Smokers'\nclaims under Bivens, supra, and the federal Constitution is\n\n                               15\n\fwhether defendant tobacco companies should be r egarded\nas federal actors. In Bivens, the Supr eme Court found that\na damages claim arose under the federal Constitution\nwhere a federal agent acting under color of federal authority\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. Id. A Bivens action, which\nis the federal equivalent of the S 1983 cause of action\nagainst state actors, will lie where the defendant has\nviolated the plaintiff 's rights under color of federal law.\nAlexander v. Pennsylvania Dep't of Banking, No. Civ. 93-\n5510, 1994 WL 144305, at *3 (E.D. Pa. April 21, 1994).\nBlack Smokers also make \"direct constitutional\" claims\nunder the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments. As the\nDistrict Court noted in its opinion, the Fourteenth\nAmendment only applies to actions of the states and not to\nthe federal government; therefore, the District Court\nproperly granted defendants' motion to dismiss the\nFourteenth Amendment claims. For Black Smokers' Bivens\nand Fifth Amendment claims to succeed, Black Smokers\nmust establish that defendants are federal actors. Because\ndefendants' conduct cannot properly be r egarded as federal,\nthese claims must fail.\n\nIn order to determine whether the conduct of a private\nparty should be attributed to the federal gover nment,\ncourts apply the \"state action\" analysis set forth by the\nSupreme Court in Lugar v. Edmonson Oil Co. , 457 U.S. 922,\n937-42, 102 S.Ct. 2744 (1982). The Supreme Court\nsuccinctly summarized the two-part test of Lugar in its\ndecision in Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete, 500 U.S. 614,\n620, 111 S.Ct. 2077 (1991). There, the Court stated that\nLugar requires courts to ask \"first whether the claimed\nconstitutional deprivation resulted from the exercise of a\nright or privilege having its source in [federal] authority . . .\nand second, whether the private party charged with the\ndeprivation could be described in all fairness as a [federal]\nactor.\" Leesville Concrete, 500 U.S. at 620 (applying Lugar)\n(citations omitted). Citing American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nSullivan, 526 U.S. 40, 119 S.Ct. 977 (1999), Black Smokers\nargue that their claims satisfy the first pr ong of Lugar\ninsofar as defendants had acted \"with knowledge of and\npursuant to\" the statute in question: the Labeling Act. This\nargument is unavailing because it fails to allege a\ndeprivation of a right protected by the Constitution.\n\n                               16\n\fMoreover, the averment that defendants should be\nsubject to the mandates of the Constitution because their\nactivities have been allegedly approved by the federal\ngovernment through defendants' compliance with the\nLabeling Act is unconvincing. The mere fact that a tobacco\ncompany has complied with the requirements of a federal\nlaw cannot suffice to transform it into a federal actor any\nmore than the compliance of a myriad of private enterprises\nwith federal law and administrative regulations could of\nitself work such a transformation.2 Additionally, because\nthe alleged wrongdoing (the targeted advertising of\nmentholated tobacco products to African-Americans) is not\nrequired by the Labeling Act, it is difficult to view such\ntargeted advertising as federal action by defendants which\ncan serve as the basis for a Bivens action.\n\nThe second requirement of the Lugar analysis -- that the\nprivate party could in all fairness be r egarded as a federal\nactor -- may be met under one of three interr elated theories\nof government action: (i) the \"public function\" test, (ii) the\n\"close nexus\" test and (iii) the \"symbiotic relationship\" test.\nIn addition, Black Smokers discern in case law a fourth,\nmore synthetic \"totality of the circumstances\" test, the\nexistence of which is doubtful, as we explain infra. In order\nto determine which test should be applied to a given set of\nfacts, courts must investigate carefully the circumstances\nof each case. See Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority,\n365 U.S. 715, 722, 81 S.Ct. 856 (1961); Community Med.\nCenter v. Emergency Med. Services, 712 F .2d 878, 880 (3d.\nCir. 1983) (citations omitted). Regar dless of what test is\nultimately applied, the object of the inquiry is to determine\nwhether a private entity has exercised powers traditionally\nreserved exclusively to the government, Jackson v.\nMetropolitan Edison Co., 419 U.S. 345, 352, 95 S.Ct. 449\n(1974), or whether \"the defendant exercised power\npossessed by virtue of [federal] law and made possible only\nbecause the wrongdoer is clothed in the authority of\n[federal] law.\" Groman v. T ownship of Manalapan, 47 F.3d\n628, 639 n.17 (3d. Cir. 1995) (citations omitted).\n\nThe gravamen of the \"public function\" test is whether the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. See our discussion of the \"public function\" test in this Section,\ninfra.\n\n                               17\n\fgovernment is effectively using the private entity in\nquestion to avoid a constitutional obligation or to engage in\nactivities reserved to the government. See Goussis v.\nKimball, 813 F.Supp. 352, 357 (E.D. Pa. 1993). We cannot\nagree with Black Smokers' assertion that defendants'\nactions satisfy the \"public function\" test. The \"public\nfunction\" test is the most rigorous of the inquiries. In Blum\nv. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. at 1004-5, the Supreme Court\nstressed that the traditionally public function must be the\n\"exclusive prerogative of the [gover nment],\" id. (citation\nomitted). Courts generally emphasize this \"exclusivity\"\nrequirement and thus seldom find that high standard to\nhave been satisfied. Mark v. Borough of Hatboro, 51 F.3d\n1137, 1142 (3d. Cir. 1995). Even in cases involving\narguably semi-public functions, such as pr oviding utility\nservices, see Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., supra, or\nfurnishing remedial education to high school students, see\nRendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 102 S.Ct. 2764\n(1982), the Supreme Court has declined to characterize\nsuch activities as government functions for purposes of the\npublic function analysis.\n\nIn the case at bar, the action complained of is the lawful\nsale and marketing of a legal, albeit federally r egulated,\nconsumer product: a private rather than public, and a\nfortiori not \"exclusively\" public, function. Even if the\nactivities at issue extended, as Black Smokers suggest,\nbeyond the mere marketing and sale of mentholated\ntobacco products to the testing and labeling of such\nproducts, Black Smokers' argument would fail because it\nwould not meet the exclusivity requirement under the\npublic function test. Given that many products, including\nmentholated tobacco, are tested, marketed and labeled by\ntheir manufacturers, often in accordance with applicable\nregulatory requirements, such activities cannot be\ncharacterized as the exclusive prerogative of the\ngovernment. As the District Court noted, it is simply\ninaccurate to suggest that the testing, labeling and\nmarketing of cigarettes is the exclusive pr ovince of the\nfederal government. Finally, Black Smokers' averment that\ndefendants' compliance with various federal labeling\nrequirements transforms defendants into government\nactors is without support in applicable case law. Such\n\n                               18\n\fpropositions have been flatly rejected by the Supreme Court\non several occasions; see American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. v.\nSullivan, 526 U.S. 40 (1999); Blum v. Y aretsky, 457 U.S. at\n1004; Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co ., 419 U.S. 345,\n350 (1974) (holding that the fact that a business is subject\nto government regulation does not by itself convert the\nbusiness's action into that of the government).\n\nBlack Smokers' allegations that defendants' actions\nsatisfy the \"close nexus\" test under the gover nment action\nanalysis are also unavailing. As with the public function\nanalysis, Black Smokers apparently discer n the purported\nnexus between the private action complained of and the\nfederal government in the operation of the Labeling Act.\nThey assert that the Labeling Act encourages tobacco\nmanufacturers to conceal the dangers of mentholated\ncigarettes, mandates inadequate warnings on such\nproducts and preempts most tort actions against\ndefendants. However, because the Labeling Act does not\ncompel, influence or encourage the actions upon which this\nsuit is based -- the targeted marketing of menthol\ncigarettes to African-Americans -- but rather only requires\nthe disclosure of certain risks on tobacco pr oduct\npackaging, defendants' conduct in compliance with the\nLabeling Act does not create the \"close nexus\" necessary for\na finding of state action. See Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457\nU.S. 830 (1982); American Mfrs. Mut. Inc. Co. v. Sullivan,\n526 U.S. at 52; Goussis v. Kimball, 813 F .Supp. at 357.\nAdditionally, Black Smokers' \"close nexus\" ar gument is\ndefective to the extent that it does not allege the violation\nof a federal right, a prerequisite under that analysis. See\nGoussis v. Kimball, 813 F.Supp. at 357.\n\nBlack Smokers' attempt to classify this case under the\n\"symbiotic relationship\" category of state action cases is\nsimilarly tenuous. In the seminal, albeit somewhat\nidiosyncratic, case of Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth.,\nsupra, the Supreme Court held that a cof fee shop, which\nleased property located in a government owned parking\ngarage, was integrated with the parking facility as an\norganic part of the government operation and was party to\na mutually beneficial relationship with the government. Out\nof these facts arose the \"symbiotic r elationship test,\" which\n\n                               19\n\fasks whether the government has \"insinuated itself into a\nposition of interdependence\" with the defendant. Burton v.\nWilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. at 725.\n\nBlack Smokers' allegations concerning defendants'\nrelationship with the federal government prove both too\nlittle and too much; and in any case, they scar cely suffice\nto make out a \"symbiotic relationship\" within the meaning\nof Burton. Black Smokers aver that (i) the government\nbenefits from its relationship with defendants by virtue of\ncollecting \"enormous tax revenues\" from the tobacco\nindustry and (ii) the interests of the gover nment and\ndefendants are \"explicitly intertwined\" under the terms of\nthe Labeling Act, id. While these aver ments are\nundoubtedly true, they are inadequate to demonstrate\ngovernment action. Virtually all enterprises are subject to\ntax collection and, to varying degrees, to r egimes of\nadministrative regulation; were these attributes sufficient to\nsatisfy the test of Burton, substantially all businesses in the\ncountry would effectively become federal actors. See\nHadges v. Yonkers Racing Corp., 918 F .2d 1079, 1082 (2d\nCir. 1990). Moreover, although Burton retains much of its\nprecedential value, it should be noted that the Supreme\nCourt has recently cast some degree of doubt upon that\ndecision. In American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, supra,\nwhich reversed our finding that certain private insurance\ncompanies were to be regarded as state actors under\nBurton, the Supreme Court noted that \" Burton was one of\nour early cases dealing with `state action' under the\nFourteenth Amendment, and later cases have r efined the\nvague `joint participation' test embodied in that case.\" Id.,\n526 U.S. at 57 (citations omitted).3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. We recently applied the doctrine of Burton, as refined by the Supreme\nCourt in Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 92 S.Ct. 1965\n(1972), in Crissman v. Dover Downs Entertainment Inc., No. 00-5178, ___\nF.3d ___ (2001). The instant case is distinguishable from Crissman\nbecause in the latter case, which involved state-licensed harness racing\nand related gambling activities, state involvement extended far beyond\nregulation and revenue collection. In Crissman, the harness racing\noperator functioned as the state's agent with r espect to video lottery\noperations and was obligated to enforce a state statute relating to\nharness racing. See Crissman, ___ F.3d at ___ - ___ [Section III]. Such an\nagency relationship coupled with law enfor cement authority confers\nupon the operator attributes of government sovereignty wholly absent in\nthe federal government's regulation of tobacco manufacturers.\n\n                                20\n\fFinally, Black Smokers contend that an expansive, fact-\noriented \"totality of the circumstances\" approach to the\nquestion of government action exists wholly apart from the\nthree inquiries discussed supra and that such an approach\nis grounded in Third Circuit cases such as Sullivan v.\nBarnett, 139 F.3d 158 (3d Cir . 1998), rev'd 526 U.S. 40\n(1999), and Mark v. Borough of Hatbor o, 151 F.3d 1137 (3d.\nCir. 1995). Although our cases place \"the factual context in\nwhich the case arises,\" Sullivan v. Bar nett, 139 F.3d at 170,\nat the heart of the government action analysis, such\nemphasis constitutes no more than proper adherence to the\nmethodology set forth in the government action cases\ndiscussed supra and consequently cannot be said to\nrepresent a novel development in or distinct branch of\ngovernment action doctrine.\n\nPurporting to use this asserted \"totality of the\ncircumstances\" test as the basis of their r emaining\ngovernment action analysis, Black Smokers compare the\ninstant case to Edmonson v. Leesville Concr ete, 500 U.S.\n614 (1991). Leaving aside the question whether the federal\ncourts have ever explicitly recognized Black Smokers'\n\"totality of the circumstances\" appr oach, the facts of the\ninstant case are readily distinguishable from those of\nEdmonson. In Edmonson, the Supreme Court held that\nlawyers' use of peremptory challenges was pursuant to a\ncourse of government action and consequently that any\nracially discriminatory use of such challenges violates\njurors' equal protection rights. Edmonson v. Leesville\nConcrete, 500 U.S. at 622-23. The sine qua non of the\nCourt's decision in Edmonson was the pr esence of\ngovernment involvement so pervasive in the context of the\nchallenged actions as to render such actions virtually\ninseparable from the participation of the gover nment. The\nEdmonson Court therefore emphasized that peremptory\nchallenges \"simply could not exist\" without the\ngovernment's \"significant participation.\" Id. at 622. The\nCourt went on to characterize the jury as \"a quintessential\ngovernment body, having no attributes of a private actor,\"\nid. at 624, and to note that peremptory challenges are\nperformed in the context of an inar guably \"traditional\ngovernment function\": trial by jury. Id . By contrast, in the\ninstant case, the federal government does not in any\n\n                               21\n\fmanner design, mandate or approve the alleged racially\ntargeted advertising of which Black Smokers complain,\nnotwithstanding the fact that such advertising is subject to\ncertain requirements and restrictions set forth in the\nLabeling Act. Black Smokers' insistence at oral ar gument\nthat the preemption of certain categories of tort actions by\nthe Labeling Act in some way constitutes the exer cise of a\ntraditional government function or significant governmental\nparticipation within the meaning of Edmonson is also\nwithout support in applicable precedent; indeed, such\npreemption provisions are commonplace in federal product\nsafety and information disclosure legislation. See, e.g.,\nFederal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.,\nnote (b)(1)(A); Moss v. Parks Corp., 985 F .2d 736, 739-41\n(4th Cir. 1993) (construing preemption provision of Federal\nHazardous Substances Act). Moreover , the marketing and\nadvertising practices of defendants, including their research\nand safety testing activities, are functions typical of various\nprivate enterprises and, even in light of the federal\nregulation to which such activities are subject under the\nLabeling Act and other legislation, are difficult to regard as\n\"traditional government function[s]\" within the meaning of\nEdmonson.\n\nE. SECTION 1985(3) CLAIM\n\nBlack Smokers' 42 U.S.C. S 1985(3) claims ar e deficient\nin several respects and consequently may be disposed of\nrelatively quickly. Section 1985(3) provides, in pertinent\npart:\n\n       If two or more persons in any State or T erritory\n       conspire, or go in disguise on the highway or on the\n       premises of another, for the purpose of depriving,\n       either directly or indirectly, any person or class of\n       persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal\n       privileges and immunities under the laws; . . .[and] in\n       any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one\n       or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be\n       done, any act in furtherance of the object of such\n       conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or\n       property, or deprived of having and exer cising any right\n       or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party\n\n                                22\n\f       so injured or deprived may have an action for r ecovery\n       of the damages, occasioned by such injury or\n       deprivation, against any one or more of the\n       conspirators.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1985(3). In general, the conspiracy provision of\nS 1985(3) provides a cause of action under rather limited\ncircumstances against both private and state actors. In\norder successfully to bring an action underS 1985(3) for\nprivate conspiracy, a plaintiff must show, inter alia, \"(a)\nthat a racial or other class-based invidious discriminatory\nanimus lay behind the coconspirators' actions, (b) that the\ncoconspirators intended to deprive the victim of a right\nguaranteed by the Constitution against private impairment,\nand (c) that that right was consciously targeted and not\njust incidentally affected.\" Spencer v. Casavila, 44 F.3d 74,\n77 (2d Cir. 1994) (citation omitted); see also Tilton v.\nRichardson, 6 F.3d 683, 686 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding that\nthe same elements are required forS1985(3) claims against\nprivate actors). In order to prevent the use of S1985(3) as a\ngeneral federal tort law, courts have been car eful to limit\ncauses of action thereunder to conspiracies that deprive\npersons of constitutionally protected rights, privileges and\nimmunities \"that are protected against private, as well as\nofficial encroachment.\" Libertad v. W elch, 53 F.3d 428, 446-\n50 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nIt is well established that S 1985(3) does not itself create\nany substantive rights; rather, it serves only as a vehicle for\nvindicating federal rights and privileges which have been\ndefined elsewhere. See Great Am. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v.\nNovotny, 442 U.S. 366, 376, 99 S.Ct. 2345 (1979).\nMoreover, in the context of actions br ought against private\nconspirators, the Supreme Court has thus far r ecognized\nonly two rights protected under S 1985(3): the right to be\nfree from involuntary servitude and the right to interstate\ntravel. See Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 506\nU.S. 263, 278, 113 S.Ct. 753 (1993); Caswell v. The\nMorning Call, Inc., No. Civ. A. 95-7081, 1996 WL 560355,\nat *6 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 30, 1996); Welch v. Board of Dirs. of\nWildwood Golf Club, 877 F.Supp. 955, 959 (W.D. Pa. 1995).\n\nThe instant case is distinguishable from the cases cited\nabove because Black Smokers assert the deprivation of a\n\n                               23\n\fdifferent type of rights: those of pr operty and contract.\nAdditionally, the District Court correctly observed that\nbecause such rights -- which entail freedom from\ndiscrimination by a private actor -- are statutorily enacted,\nrather than of purely constitutional pr ovenance, they\ncannot be vindicated under S 1985(3).\n\nBlack Smokers attempt to salvage their S 1985(3) claims\nby arguing that defendants' alleged violations of SS 1981\nand 1982 may support a claim under S 1985(3). In light of\nthe overwhelming preponderance of authority on the\nquestion, this argument, too, must fail. Contrary to Black\nSmokers' claims, Bray does not support the proposition\nthat SS 1981 or 1982 claims can form the basis of a\nS 1985(3) claim or the notion that the contract and property\nrights protected by SS 1981 and 1982 fall within the\ncategory of \"involuntary servitude\" violations that may\nsupport a S 1985(3) claim. Isolated authority from the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia does exist in\nsupport of the theory that a S 1985(3) claim may be based\non a S 1981 claim. See Johnson v. Gr eater Southeast\nCommunity Hospital Corp., 903 F.Supp. 140, 153-154, citing\nAlder v. Columbia Historical Society, 690 F .Supp. 9 (D.D.C.\n1988); Thompson v. Int'l Assoc. of Machinists , 580 F.Supp.\n662 (D.D.C. 1984). The great weight of pr ecedential\nauthority, however, supports the traditional limitation of\nS 1985(3) to questions of interstate travel and involuntary\nservitude and does not suggest that SS 1981 or 1982 claims\nin general may form the basis of a S 1985(3) action. See,\ne.g., Sanders v. Prentice-Hall Corp. , 178 F.3d. 1296 (Table),\n1999 WL 115517, at *2 (6th Cir. Feb. 8, 1999); Libertad v.\nWelch, 53 F.3d 428, 447 n.15 (1st Cir. 1995); Tilton v.\nRichardson, 6 F.3d 683, 686 (10th Cir. 1993). We need not,\nhowever, resolve the question whether violations of SS 1981\nand 1982 can support a S 1985(3) claim because Black\nSmokers have failed to state a claim under eitherS 1981 or\nS 1982.4 The District Court therefore correctly dismissed\nBlack Smokers' claims under S1985(3).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. See Section III B, supra.\n\n                               24\n\fIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affir m the decision of\nthe District Court in all respects. The District Court\ncorrectly held that Black Smokers' claims of racially\ntargeted advertising and marketing of mentholated tobacco\nproducts were inadequate to state a cause of action under\n42 U.S.C. SS 1981 and 1982. Because Black Smokers do\nnot demonstrate that defendants should be regar ded as\nstate actors, the District Court properly dismissed their\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 as well. Finally, we will\naffirm the District Court's conclusion that Black Smokers\nfail to allege adequately that defendants ar e federal actors\nfor purposes of claims asserted either pursuant to Bivens or\ndirectly under the federal Constitution and that they fail to\nstate a cause of action under S 1985(3).\n\n                               25\n\fSHADUR, District Judge, Dissenting in part:\n\nWhat has been said in the majority opinion may pr operly\nbe viewed as having put forth the best possible case for\naffirmance of the District Court's dismissal of the Black\nSmokers' Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\"). But\nthat presentation, I believe, has despite itself highlighted\nthe basic flaws in such a threshold Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"Rule\")\n12(b)(6) dismissal. Accordingly I dissent fr om the portion of\nthe majority opinion that rejects Black Smokers' claims\nunder Sections 1981, 1982 and 1985(3) at the thr eshold of\nthe case.1\n\nBoth the panel majority and I necessarily pr oceed from\nthe seminal statement in Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467\nU.S. 69, 73 (1984) of the quite undemanding bur den that\nRule 12(b)(6) imposes on a plaintiff 's complaint:\n\n       A court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that\n       no relief could be granted under any set of facts that\n       could be proved consistent with the allegations. Conley\n       v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957).\n\nAnd the majority opinion also correctly r ecognizes, though\nI fear it does not fairly apply, the proposition that all\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn fr om the\nallegations in the Complaint, as well as the allegations\nthemselves, must be accepted as true (Moor e v. Tartler, 986\nF.2d 682, 685 (3d Cir. 1993)).\n\nBecause we deal with a Complaint whose allegations\nmust thus be credited, there is no need to dwell at length\non the appalling record disclosed by Black Smokers'\npleading. Their 110-page 211-paragraph Complaint does\nnot comport with the Rule 8(a)(2) requir ement of \"a short\nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Because I agree that there is no pr edicate for ascribing state actor\nor\nfederal actor status to the tobacco companies or the other defendants, I\nconcur in the majority's rejection of Black Smokers' claims under Section\n1983 and under the Bivens line of authority. And while speaking of the\nother defendants, to simplify the ensuing discussion I will refer solely\nto\nthe defendant tobacco companies, for in my view any sorting out among\nthe defendants ought to be done by the district court on remand in light\nof what is said here.\n\n                                26\n\fis entitled to relief,\" but they can scar cely be faulted for\nwhat would normally be viewed as overkill in light of the\nundue judicial skepticism with which their ef fort has been\nmet. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the\nsubstantially higher carcinogenic effects of the tobacco\ncompanies' mentholated products, the use of which an\nextensively quoted 1998 Surgeon General's r eport and other\nmedical research discloses as having led to a much higher\nrate of lung cancer, pharyngeal cancer and other\nmalignancies among Blacks (Complaint PP80-91),\nphenomena that had been confirmed by the tobacco\ncompanies' own significant research (which the companies\nhad suppressed). And the Complaint further alleges that\ndespite that knowledge, the companies nevertheless\nengaged in extensive conduct that adversely impacted on\nBlack Smokers (id. PP48, 63), even including the actual\ndesign and introduction (though it was then abandoned in\nthe face of public outrage) of a mentholated pr oduct\nexpressly for Blacks (id. P45.c).\n\nIn that light, where I first part company with the majority\nopinion is in its having ruled as a matter of law \"that Black\nSmokers' allegations of racially targeted marketing of\nmentholated tobacco products cannot, in the absence of\nany disparity between the products sold to African-\nAmericans and the products sold to others, constitute a\ndeprivation of contract or property rights actionable under\nSS1981 or 1982.\" And my departure fr om that\nunsupportable proposition flows directly from the straw\nman first erected by the majority opinion when it says:\n\n       Black Smokers do not make the sort of claim that is\n       most readily actionable under the statute: that they\n       have been deprived by defendants of the right to\n       contract for, purchase, own or use either menthol or\n       non-menthol cigarettes.\n\nWhat must be understood instead is that both Section\n1981 and Section 1982 are not at all limited by their terms\nto the outright deprivation of the Black community's right\nto contract. Instead each of those statutes mandates an\nequal playing field that is violated by conduct that imposes\ndifferent and race-discriminatory conditions (however\ncreated) on the exercise of seemingly comparable\n\n                               27\n\fcontractual rights: Section 1981 guarantees to Black\nSmokers \"the same right . . . to make . .. contracts . . . as\nis enjoyed by white citizens,\" while Section 1982 assures to\nBlack Smokers \"the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white\ncitizens . . . to . . . purchase . . . personal property.\" And\nthat is the gravamen of the Complaint--that by the tobacco\ncompanies' deliberate and successful targeting of Black\nSmokers to persuade them to purchase and smoke the\nconcededly more dangerous menthol cigar ettes and\nsmokeless tobacco--conduct whose actionability is akin to\nthe prohibition of actual \"steering\" under the Fair Housing\nAct--those companies have impaired that equality of rights.\n\nNor should it avail the tobacco companies to attempt to\ntrot out \"freedom of contract\" principles. On the\nuncontested allegations of the Complaint, they have\ndeliberately suppressed the added perils cr eated by the\nmentholated products, concealing them fr om Black\nSmokers. And it just will not do for the tobacco companies\nto argue that they are somehow equal opportunity deceivers\n--that they have betrayed Whites and Blacks alike by their\ndeception. When their alleged concealment of the known\nrisks (known to them, that is) is coupled with their express\nefforts to maximize the sales of mentholated coffin nails\nand mentholated smokeless tobacco to Blacks, the\ninequality of treatment forbidden by Sections 1981 and\n1982 is demonstrated by the fairly-read Complaint.\n\nAnd this is not at all speculative. Defendants' r epeated\n(and it must be said hypocritical) emphasis on the fact that\n69% of the mentholated products are used by non-Blacks\nis as deceptive as their historical conduct of denying the\nextraordinarily harmful effects of nicotine generally and of\nmenthol in particular. What that repeated emphasis glosses\nover is the enormous disparity between the 10+% of the\npopulation represented by Blacks and the Black Smokers'\n31%2 consumption of the menthol cigarettes. It will be\nrecalled that the rule of thumb for demonstrating\ndiscrimination has been recognized in these ter ms for a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. As the majority opinion indicates, 31% is the most charitable (to the\ntobacco companies) of the numbers reflected by statistics cited in the\nComplaint. Other studies put that number as high as 61.5% and 66%.\n\n                               28\n\fquarter century (Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 483, 496-\n97 n.17 (1976)):\n\n       As a general rule for such large samples, if the\n       difference between the expected value and the observed\n       number is more than 2 or 3 standard deviations, then\n       the hypothesis that the difference was random will be\n       suspect to a social scientist.\n\nTwo standard deviations equate to a 5% likelihood of\nchance distribution. And by contrast the probability that a\n10% versus 31% disparity is a matter of mere chance\nrepresents, as an approximation (and essentially a\nconservative one) of the normal distribution, some 7\nstandard deviations--producing a figur e so small as to\nbeggar the imagination: 1.28 in a trillion. 3\n\nThat extraordinary imbalance (truly an understatement,\nfor such a huge disparity is almost beyond human\ncomprehension) really cuts the legs out fr om under the\nmajority opinion's attempt to distinguish the decision in\nRoper v. Edwards, 815 F.2d 1474 (11th Cir. 1987) by\nstating:\n\n       One might argue that if racially directed marketing of\n       menthol cigarettes resulted in a situation in which\n       virtually all mentholated tobacco products wer e\n       consumed by African-Americans and substantially all\n       non-mentholated tobacco products by others, that case\n       might come within the sweep of Roper. However, Black\n       Smokers have not alleged such a situation.\n\nIn real world terms there is no conceptual difference\nbetween the notion that \"virtually all mentholated tobacco\nproducts were consumed by African-Americans\" and the\nsituation in which that group's comparative consumption is\nso close to 100% of total consumption in the meaningful\nstatistical sense.\n\nIt is surely unreasonable to ascribe such an enormous\ndisparity to chance rather than to the purposeful steering\nthat has been alleged by Black Smokers--at a minimum,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. That figure is derived from William Knight, Tables of the Normal\nDistribution, at http://www.math.unb.ca/~knight/utility/NormTble.htm.\n\n                                29\n\fthey should be allowed their day in court to pr ove that\nracial animus may reasonably be inferred from the tobacco\ncompanies' deliberate targeting of African-Americans as\ntheir far-preferred targets of the more dangerous products\nat issue. There is no question that even the far, far smaller\nbut still statistically significant disparity of two standard\ndeviations suffices to warrant an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination--see, e.g., such cases as Smith v. Xerox\nCorp., 196 F.3d 358, 365-66 (2d Cir . 1999).\n\nNor I suggest will it do (as the tobacco companies have\nurged and as the majority opinion has cr edited) to say that\nBlack Smokers cannot complain about that deliberate\nsteering because Blacks were already pr edisposed to prefer\nthe mentholated products. We are after all dealing with the\ncase at its very outset. Nothing has been shown--because\nno opportunity has been given to Black Smokers--as to\nwhether that preference was itself the pr oduct of the same\nkind of improper steering at the outset, or even if not, as to\nwhether the earlier preference even began to approach (let\nalone to account for) the enormous disparity that now\nexists (a showing that might for example be accomplished,\nagain to deal with statistical probabilities, through the\napplication of multiple regression analysis).\n\nIn response to Black Smokers' uncontroverted allegations\nabout the tobacco companies' purposeful steering of their\nknown extra-harmful mentholated products to the African-\nAmerican market, the majority opinion accepts the\nargument that this was no more than conventional\nadvertising, something that Jones v. Alfr ed H. Mayer Co.,\n392 U.S. 409, 413 (1968) characterized as nonactionable\nunder Section 1982. But Jones v. Mayer, id. said only this\nin the course of announcing for the first time that Section\n1982 applies to private as well as public racial\ndiscrimination in the sale of property (a statement made in\nthe course of contrasting that statute with the full-bore\nopen housing law that was then brand new on the books):\n\n       It [Section 1982] does not prohibit advertising or\n       other representations that indicate discriminatory\n       preferences.\n\nThat sanitization of mere statements of discriminatory\npreferences does not control her e, however, for when such\n\n                                30\n\fdiscriminatory preferences are translated into\ndiscriminatory action, as is alleged her e (and as we must\ncredit), the actor cannot fairly be insulated from the impact\nof Section 1982 (or of Section 1981) by asserting that its\nadvertising was a means by which it accomplished that\nforbidden end.\n\nIndeed, that is precisely the thrust of the eloquent\nopinion by the late Judge Luther Swygert in Clark v.\nUniversal Builders, 501 F.2d 324 (7th Cir . 1974), which\nfound support rather than a lack of support in Jones v.\nMayer, but which the majority opinion seeks to distinguish\nbecause the sales of housing to Black purchasers in Clark\nwere on more onerous terms than the sales to non-Blacks.\nBut once again I suggest that the attempted distinction is\nhollow--that defendants' conduct set out in the Complaint\nin this case effectively created the same type of separate,\nracially-segregated market as was found actionable in\nClark. Such cases as Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, 895\nF.2d 1521, 1525, 1529 (7th Cir. 1990) teach that racial\nsteering is forbidden both by Section 1982 and by the Fair\nHousing Act (each of which was implicated ther e)--and of\ncourse Section 1982 is not limited to anti-Black\ndiscrimination in housing, as is the Fair Housing Act.4\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Even brief reflection on what Jones v. Mayer did not say, as well as on\nwhat it did say, demonstrates that the majority opinion loads that\nopinion's single sentence quoted above with mor e baggage than it can\nreasonably carry. Just as there is nothing actionable (for example) in the\nseller of clothing deciding that it wishes to expand its market by\ndepicting Black as well as White models in its clothing ads, so too a\nmere indication of racial preferences in advertising is not actionable as\nsuch under Section 1982. But what I believe is just as obviously\nprohibited by that statute is using such advertising to deny Blacks the\nsame treatment as Whites--the rights to contract and to purchase under\nthe same conditions--by deliberately subjecting Blacks to the far greater\nimpact of the seriously (often fatally) deleterious effects of the\nadvertised\nproduct--effects well known to but undisclosed by the tobacco\ncompanies. And as for the majority opinion's ef fort to distinguish Clark\nv. Universal Builders, it is necessarily appar ent (though it was\nundiscussed because not placed into issue ther e) that the Black\npurchasers in that case were the victims of sales of substandard housing\n--in violation of Section 1982--that had to be accomplished through\nadvertising. After all, the alternative pr emise of assuming that those\n\n                               31\n\fFinally, what of the required showing of racial animus? Is\nit a defense for the tobacco companies to ur ge that their\npattern of general concealment and deception r eflected\nnothing more than a free market desir e to make profit, and\nthat their targeting of Black Smokers was nothing more\nthan a desire to maximize those profits because the Blacks\nwere most vulnerable to the most deleterious pr oducts?\nAgain, unlawfully discriminatory intent under the\ndiscrimination laws generally has been recognized as\nreasonably inferable from far less evidence of disparate\nimpact--should any different principle apply here? Once\nmore the tobacco companies' callous indif ference to\nsmokers' health has been demonstrably more marked\ntoward Black Smokers--that is the combined ef fect (1) of\nthe tobacco companies' knowledge (and their concealment\nof that knowledge) about the special deadliness of the\nmentholated products that they have been marketing and\n(2) of their express targeting of those products toward the\nAfrican-American community.\n\nIt is not of course my purpose to express any conclusion\nas to the existence or nonexistence of the pr ohibited intent.\nInstead the focus of this opinion is to stress the\nrequirement that, as with all other factual issues, intent\nmust be resolved by a factfinding jury (or perhaps by a\njudge in the summary judgment context of Rule 56, rather\nthan at the preliminary pleading stage under Rule 12(b)(6),\nwhere plaintiffs' allegations must be accepted as true). And\nto that end I find it particularly poignant that we deal here\nwith a group of defendants whose industry is centered in\nan area where Blacks were once chattels, viewed as\nsubhuman--again ironically in terms of the present\nlitigation, chattels whose slave labor was r esponsible in\nlarge part for the economic success of the tobacco industry.\nEven though a century and a half has elapsed since that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsales were spontaneously generated would r equire turning the aphorism\ncredited to Emerson on its head to read:\n\n       If a man can make a worse mouse-trap than his neighbor, though\n       he builds his house in the woods the world will make a beaten path\n       to his door.\n\n                               32\n\fmindset was supposed to have been eliminated by the Civil\nWar and by the post-War Civil Rights Acts (including\nSections 1981 and 1982), all of us know that the r eality of\nracial prejudice has unfortunately long outlived the theory\nembodied in those statutes. Whether any such pr ejudice\nhas been at work here should not, I believe, be resolved on\na threshold determination of the likelihood or unlikelihood\nof Black Smokers' ability to prove their allegations in that\nrespect.\n\nWe would do well to remember what Justice O'Connor\n(speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court on this issue)\nsaid in rejecting the threshold dismissal of a pro se\nprisoner's complaint because of a judicial view that its\nallegations were unlikely (Denton v. Her nandez, 504 U.S.\n25, 33 (1992)):\n\n       Some improbable allegations might properly be\n       disposed of on summary judgment, but to dismiss\n       them as frivolous without any factual development is to\n       disregard the age-old insight that many allegations\n       might be \"strange, but true; for truth is always strange,\n       Stranger than fiction.\" Lord Byron, Don Juan, canto\n       XIV, stanza 101 (T. Steffan, E. Steffan, & W. Pratt eds.\n       1977).\n\nBlack Smokers are surely entitled to no less, where their\nfactual assertions are so solidly supported (and not in the\nleast fanciful), and where the perceived problems with their\nComplaint really represent skepticism as to their ability to\nprove causation and intent--classic issues of fact to be\nresolved by a factfinding jury and not by judicial\nprescreening.\n\nIn sum, I suggest that cutting Black Smokers of f before\nthey have had the opportunity to demonstrate that they can\ndeliver as advertised5 in their Complaint does violence to\nthe fundamental principles of judicial reading of\ncomplaints, as acknowledged both in the majority opinion\nand in this dissent. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent in\nthe respects spoken of here.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5.

Plaintif fs, a group\nof African-Americans, brought a civil rights action,\ncontending that, with this knowledge, defendant tobacco\ncompanies have targeted the marketing of mentholated\ntobacco products at African-Americans.\n\nPlaintiffs, who designate themselves the \"Black Smokers,\"\nare the Rev. Jesse Brown, the Uptown Coalition for Tobacco\nControl and Healing, Aaron Eleazar , Pansy Smith, Ellen\nIrving, and the National Association of African Americans\nfor Positive Imagery, Inc. They brought this civil rights\naction on behalf of a class of all living Black Americans who\nhave, since 1954, purchased or consumed mentholated\n\n                               4\n\ftobacco products. They named as defendants the tobacco\ncompanies: Philip Morris, Inc., R.J. Reynolds T obacco\nCompany, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, Br own &\nWilliamson Tobacco Corporation, B.A.T . Industries, the\nAmerican Tobacco Company, Lorillard T obacco Company,\nInc., Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company, Liggett Group Inc.\nand United States Tobacco Company; the non-pr ofit\norganizations supported by the tobacco-industry: the\nTobacco Institute, Inc., the Council for T obacco Research --\nU.S.A., Inc., and Smokeless Tobacco Council, Inc.; and the\npublic relations firm Hill & Knowlton, Inc. Black Smokers\ncontend that each of the defendants has unlawfully\nengaged in targeted marketing and sales of mentholated\ntobacco products to African-Americans on the basis of their\nrace in violation of the civil rights statutes codified at 42\nU.S.C. SS 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1985(3). Black Smokers\nalso assert a cause of action against defendants under\nBivens v. Six Unknown Federal Narcotics Agents , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), and the Fifth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution, arguing that defendants should\nbe considered federal actors by virtue of the federal\nregulatory scheme to which the tobacco industry is subject.\n\nThe District Court granted defendants' motion to dismiss\nfor failure to state a claim. We will affirm that decision. We\nagree with the District Court that Black Smokers'\nallegations of racially targeted marketing of mentholated\ntobacco products cannot, in the absence of any disparity\nbetween the products sold to African-Americans and the\nproducts sold to others, constitute a deprivation of contract\nor property rights actionable under SS 1981 or 1982. We\nalso concur with the District Court that ther e is no\nallegation that defendants are state actors to support the\nS 1983 claim and that defendants cannot be r egarded as\nfederal actors as is required to maintain the claims under\nBivens and the Fifth Amendment. Although we agree with\nthe District Court that Black Smokers failed to state a\nclaim under S 1985(3), we need not reach the further\nquestion whether SS 1981 and 1982 claims can, as a matter\nof law, support a claim under S 1985(3). As the District\nCourt noted, even assuming arguendo that Black Smokers\ncould properly premise a S 1985(3) cause of action on a\n\n                               5\n\fviolation of SS1981 and 1982, they have failed to state a\nclaim under SS 1981 and 1982.\n\nI. FACTS\n\nIn their Second Amended Complaint, Black Smokers\nallege that the defendants have unlawfully tar geted African-\nAmericans with billboard, magazine, and other types of\nadvertising in order to promote the sale to and\nconsumption by African-Americans of various mentholated\ntobacco products. It is not disputed that the tobacco\nindustry has designed certain menthol cigarettes\nspecifically to appeal to African-American consumers,\nincluding R.J. Reynolds' \"Uptown,\" a high tar , high nicotine\nmenthol cigarette.1 Black Smokers contend, and defendants\ndo not dispute, that medical research has demonstrated\nthat mentholated tobacco products pose gr eater health\nrisks than non-mentholated ones, including an incr eased\nincidence of cancers of the lung and pharynx. It is not\ndisputed that, although African-Americans account for only\n10.3% of the U.S. population, they account for a\nsignificantly greater share of menthol cigarette smokers.\nBlack Smokers cite reports fixing the per centage of African-\nAmerican menthol smokers at, variously, 31%, 61.5% and\n66%. Apparently relying upon the 31% figure, defendants\nclaim that a significant majority (69%) of menthol cigarette\nsmokers are not African-Americans and that Black\nSmokers admit that fact. In addition to the allegation of\nracially targeted marketing, Black Smokers also charge\ndefendants with \"intentional racial discrimination\" and a\n\"conspiracy of deception and misrepr esentation against the\nAfrican American public.\"\n\nBlack Smokers also accuse defendants of \"a massive\nconspiracy to mislead the Black American public r egarding\nthe safety of menthol tobacco products.\" Black Smokers\nidentify three courses of conduct underlying the purported\nconspiracy: \"(1) acting in concert to repr esent falsely that\ntheir menthol tobacco products are safe for African\nAmericans to use; (2) engaging in a concerted campaign to\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. The Uptown brand was withdrawn from the market by R.J. Reynolds\nin 1990 as a result of negative national publicity.\n\n                               6\n\fsaturate the African American community with danger ous,\ndefective and hazardous tobacco products, which Tobacco\nIndustry knew caused harm, in violation of the civil and\nconstitutional rights of African Americans; and (3)\nmisrepresenting, suppressing, distorting, and confusing the\ntruth about the health dangers of mentholated tobacco\nproducts.\" Notwithstanding these allegations, Black\nSmokers apparently concede in their opening appellate brief\nthat African-Americans demonstrated their pr eference for\nmenthol cigarettes before defendants initiated targeted\nadvertising. In their reply brief and at oral argument,\nhowever, Black Smokers denied making such a concession\nand asserted that defendants created the African-American\npreference for menthol cigarettes. Black Smokers did not\nallege in their opening appellate brief that defendants\ninterfere with the right of African-Americans to purchase\nnon-menthol cigarettes or that menthol cigar ettes are not\nmarketed and sold to persons other than African-\nAmericans. However, in their reply brief and at oral\nargument, Black Smokers made the surprising statement\nthat they \"do not concede that Black Americans ar e free to\npurchase non-menthol cigarettes.\"\n\nBlack Smokers do not contend that the menthol\ncigarettes marketed and sold to African-Americans are\nthemselves different from those sold to whites or other\npersons. Additionally, Black Smokers do not aver that\nAfrican-Americans receive information about menthol\ncigarettes that differs in any respect from the information\nprovided to others. However, in their r eply brief and at oral\nargument, Black Smokers made another surprising claim --\nthat while defendants suggest to African-Americans in\nadvertising that menthol cigarettes are healthier than non-\nmenthol cigarettes, are of high quality, enhance the\nsmoker's image, and are glamorous, pr estigious and\nsocially acceptable, \"none of these sales messages or terms\nare targeted to white consumers.\" Black Smokers agree,\nhowever, that defendants have employed tar geted marketing\n(e.g., advertising using African-American models and\nathletes) to sell non-menthol cigarettes such as Camel,\nLucky Strike, Kent and Eve. In addition, no party to the\ninstant litigation alleges that defendants pr ovide any\nconsumers with warnings concerning the additional health\n\n                               7\n\frisks posed by menthol cigarettes in comparison to non-\nmentholated tobacco products.\n\nBlack Smokers filed this action in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on\nOctober 19, 1998. A month later, Black Smokers filed a\nFirst Amended Class Action Complaint correcting the\ncaption. By leave of the court, Black Smokers filed a\nSecond Amended Complaint on December 9, 1998, in or der\nto add claims purportedly arising under the Fifth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\nand 42 U.S.C. S 1985(3). On January 8, 1999, defendants\nfiled a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint.\nThe District Court granted the motion to dismiss on\nSeptember 23, 1999. Jesse Brown et al. v.

REGULATING TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\nA brief summary of the federal regulation of the tobacco\nindustry is a necessary prerequisite to a discussion of\n\n                                 8\n\fBlack Smokers' civil rights claims. Manufactur ers of\ncigarettes are subject to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and\nAdvertising Act of 1965 and its successor, the Public Health\nCigarette Smoking Act of 1969, 15 U.S.C. S 1331, et seq.\n(together, the Labeling Act). The Labeling Act provides a\ncomprehensive program of federal r equirements addressing\nthe labeling and advertising of cigarettes and preempts\ncertain state law damages actions relating to smoking and\nhealth which challenge the adequacy of warnings on\ncigarette packages or the propriety of a manufacturer's\nadvertising or promotion of cigarettes. See Cipollone v.\nLiggett Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 511, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2608</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1992). In Cipollone, the Supreme Court was called upon to\ndetermine the contours of the federal pr eemption of state\nlaw actions under the Labeling Act. The Court held that (i)\nthe 1965 Act does not preempt state law damages actions\nin general; (ii) the 1969 Act does preempt claims based on\na failure to warn and on the neutralization of federally\nmandated warnings to the extent that such claims rely on\nomissions or inclusions in a manufacturer's advertising or\npromotions; and (iii) the 1969 Act does not pr eempt claims\nbased on express warranty, intentional fraud and\nmisrepresentation, or conspiracy. See Cipollone v. Liggett,\n505 U.S. at 530-31.\n\nB. CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS: SECTIONS 1981 AND 1982\n\nSection 1981, which prohibits racial discrimination in the\nmaking and enforcement of contracts and pr operty\ntransactions, provides:\n\n       All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States\n       shall have the same right in every State and T erritory\n       to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give\n       evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws\n       and proceedings for the security of persons and\n       property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be\n       subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes,\n       licenses and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1981(a). Section 1981 is derived from the Civil\nRights Act of 1866 and from the reenactment of Section 1\nof the 1866 Act in 1870. Mahone v.

SS 1981, 1982.\nThe legislative history of the 1866 Act makes clear\nCongress's intent to enact \"sweeping legislation\nimplementing the thirteenth amendment to abolish all the\nremaining badges and vestiges of the slavery system.\"\nMahone v. Waddle, 564 F.2d at 1030. As a result, the\ncurrent statute rests not only on the Fourteenth\nAmendment but also on the Thirteenth Amendment to the\nConstitution. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. at 190 (Stevens,\nJ., concurring).\n\nSection 1982, which prohibits racial discrimination in\ntransactions relating to real and personal property,\nprovides:\n\n       All citizens of the United States shall have the same\n       right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by\n       white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell,\n       hold, and convey real and personal property.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1982. Like S 1981, S 1982 is a Reconstruction\nstatute enacted to effectuate the aims of the Thirteenth and\nFourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Because of\nthe historic interrelationship between the two statutes,\ncourts have consistently construed them together . See\nSaunders v. General Services Corp., 659 F .Supp. 1042,\n1063 (E.D.

Ct.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).\n\nAccepting as true the facts alleged in the complaint, we\nconclude that Black Smokers have not alleged a claim\ncognizable under either S 1981 or S 1982. Black Smokers do\nnot make the sort of claim that is most readily actionable\nunder the statute: that they have been deprived by\ndefendants of the right to contract for, pur chase, own or\nuse either menthol or non-menthol cigarettes. Black\nSmokers do not aver that defendants have engaged in a\ndiscriminatory refusal to deal with African-Americans with\nrespect to either menthol or non-menthol cigar ettes. Nor do\nBlack Smokers claim that defendants have dealt with\ncustomers on differing terms on the basis of race; Black\nSmokers concede that defendants sell menthol cigar ettes to\nAfrican-Americans at the same price and on the same\nterms as such products are of fered to whites. Significantly,\nBlack Smokers do not allege that the mentholated tobacco\nproducts sold to African-Americans differ from those sold to\nwhites. Furthermore, at no place in their submissions do\nBlack Smokers argue any disparities with r espect to the\nmarketing or sales of non-menthol tobacco pr oducts on the\nbasis of race. Consequently, it is difficult to understand\nBlack Smokers' allegations to constitute a deprivation of\ncontract or property rights actionable underSS 1981 or\n1982. Indeed, Black Smokers' complaint appears instead to\npresent quite the opposite situation. Defendants are alleged\nto encourage the consumption by African-Americans of\ncertain of their products: mentholated cigar ettes, snuff, and\nchewing tobacco.\n\nThe question at the heart of Black Smokers' SS 1981 and\n1982 claims, then, is whether such encouragement is\n\n                               11\n\funlawful under the civil rights statutes. At the outset, we\nnote that neither party has alerted us to the existence of\nany authority standing for the proposition that an\nencouragement to deal is actionable under such statutes.\nSome authority does exist in support of the notion that\ntargeting consumers for sales of defective pr oducts on the\nbasis of race is actionable under SS 1981 and 1982. For\nexample, in Roper v. Edwards, 815 F .2d 1474 (11th Cir.\n1987), a case cited by Black Smokers, the Court of Appeals\nfor the Eleventh Circuit suggests that a cause of action\nunder S1981 exists where a burial vault manufacturer\nmade targeted sales of defective burial vaults to Black\nconsumers. Although the case was brought by white\nplaintiffs who were inadvertently sold a defective vault, and\nalthough the Court of Appeals ultimately rejected plaintiffs'\nclaims on other grounds, Black Smokers corr ectly argue\nthat the Eleventh Circuit did not reject the cause of action.\nNevertheless, Roper is readily distinguishable from the case\nat bar because unlike Roper, which involved deceptive sales\nto African-Americans of products that dif fered from those\nsold to whites, this case concerns identical products;\ndefendants sell the same menthol cigarettes to everyone.\n\nOne might argue that if racially directed marketing of\nmenthol cigarettes resulted in a situation in which virtually\nall mentholated tobacco products were consumed by\nAfrican-Americans and substantially all non-mentholated\ntobacco products by others, that case might come within\nthe sweep of Roper. However, Black Smokers have not\nalleged such a situation.\n\nIn order to salvage their S 1981 claims, Black Smokers\nresort to several alternative theories of recovery. First, they\nsuggest that defendants' advertisements for menthol\ncigarettes constitute express warranties containing\nmisrepresentations and false statements. This argument\nseems to constitute a claim of breach of expr ess warranty,\nintentional fraud or misrepresentation. Although it is true\nthat the Labeling Act does not preempt such an action,\nCipollone v. Liggett, 505 U.S. at 526-529, 530-31, Black\nSmokers fail to make sufficiently detailed allegations with\nrespect to any of these potential causes of action. Black\nSmokers imply in their submissions, and asserted at oral\n\n                               12\n\fargument, that defendants fail to disclose the increased\nhealth risks of menthol cigarettes and that the African-\nAmerican community suffers damages as a r esult of its\nhigher consumption of mentholated tobacco pr oducts.\nAlthough that claim may be factually true, it is not\nactionable. The Supreme Court has held that the 1969 Act\npreempts claims based on a failure to war n and on the\nneutralization of federally mandated warnings to the extent\nthat such claims rely on omissions or inclusions in\nadvertising or promotions. Cipollone v. Liggett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112777\"><a href=\"/opinion/112777/cipollone-v-liggett-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530-531.\n\nSecond, Black Smokers attempt to raise a claim of\nsegregated market exploitation by arguing that defendants'\npractices fall within the ambit of segregated housing cases\nsuch as Clark v. Universal Builders, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1973). This claim also fails on both factual and legal\ngrounds. In the segregated housing cases, unlike the\ninstant case, the defendants sold houses to Black\npurchasers on substantially differ ent and more onerous\nterms than to others, effectively cr eating two separate,\nracially-segregated markets. See, e.g., Clark v. Universal\nBuilders, 501 F.2d at 328. Black Smokers, however, point\nto no such disparities in the sale of mentholated tobacco\nproducts, apart from the generalized allegation that African-\nAmericans are more likely than others to buy mentholated\ntobacco products as a result of tar geted advertising.\n\nMoreover, even if Black Smokers' segr egated market\nexploitation claims were cognizable on the facts alleged, we\nmust reject them on procedural grounds. It does not appear\nthat Black Smokers advanced such claims in the District\nCourt; arguments asserted for the first time on appeal are\ndeemed to be waived and consequently are not susceptible\nof review in this Court absent exceptional cir cumstances\n(e.g., the public interest requir es that the issues be heard\nor manifest injustice would result from the failure to\nconsider such issues). See, e.g., United States v. Anthony\nDell'acquilla Enter. & Subsidiaries, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756455\"><a href=\"/opinion/756455/united-states-v-anthony-dellaquilla-enterprises-and-subsidiaries-harry/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 335 (3d\nCir. 1998) (citations omitted); United Parcel Serv.

No such exceptional cir cumstances are\napparent here.\n\n                               13\n\fThird, Black Smokers assert that defendants' targeted\nmarketing practices violate the \"full and equal benefit\"\nclause of S1981, which provides that \"[a]ll persons within\nthe jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same\nright in every State and Territory . . . to the full and equal\nbenefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of\npersons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens . . ..\"\n42 U.S.C. S 1981(a). Again, we must reject Black Smokers'\n\"full and equal benefit\" claims because they do not appear\nto have been raised in the District Court and no exceptional\ncircumstances suggest review of such claims\nnotwithstanding Black Smokers' failure to ar gue them\npreviously. United States v. Anthony Dell'acquilla Enter. &\nSubsidiaries, 150 F.3d at 335 (citations omitted). Moreover,\neven if we were to consider them, such \"full and equal\nbenefit\" claims would fail in light of a substantial line of\nauthority holding that only state actors can be sued under\nthe \"full and equal benefit\" clause of S1981.

As\nwe explain in Sections III C and D, infra, the defendants in\nthe instant case cannot be regarded as federal or state\nactors.\n\nNotwithstanding Black Smokers' arguments to the\ncontrary, their complaints essentially constitute\ndiscriminatory advertising claims. Black Smokers virtually\nadmit as much when they characterize their claims as\nallegations of discriminatory targeting in sales of allegedly\ndefective products. Although Black Smokers ar gue that\ntheir claims resemble racial profiling and racially-motivated\nprepayment cases, all such fact patterns are\ndistinguishable from the instant case because they involve\neither a naked, racially-motivated restriction on dealing or\na race-based variation of the terms of the contract at issue.\nConsequently, Black Smokers' claims remain\nfundamentally allegations of discriminatory advertising and\nare not therefore cognizable underSS 1981 or 1982.\n\nEven in the context of housing discrimination -- arguably\na paradigmatic example of the rights Congress sought to\n\n                               14\n\fprotect under the Civil Rights Acts -- ample authority\nexists in support of the proposition that discriminatory\nadvertising is not actionable under SS 1981 and 1982.

THE BIVENS AND FIFTH AMENDMENT CLAIMS\n\nThe controlling question with respect to Black Smokers'\nclaims under Bivens, supra, and the federal Constitution is\n\n                               15\n\fwhether defendant tobacco companies should be r egarded\nas federal actors. In Bivens, the Supr eme Court found that\na damages claim arose under the federal Constitution\nwhere a federal agent acting under color of federal authority\nviolated the Fourth Amendment. Id. A Bivens action, which\nis the federal equivalent of the S 1983 cause of action\nagainst state actors, will lie where the defendant has\nviolated the plaintiff 's rights under color of federal law.\nAlexander v.

As the\nDistrict Court noted in its opinion, the Fourteenth\nAmendment only applies to actions of the states and not to\nthe federal government; therefore, the District Court\nproperly granted defendants' motion to dismiss the\nFourteenth Amendment claims. For Black Smokers' Bivens\nand Fifth Amendment claims to succeed, Black Smokers\nmust establish that defendants are federal actors. Because\ndefendants' conduct cannot properly be r egarded as federal,\nthese claims must fail.\n\nIn order to determine whether the conduct of a private\nparty should be attributed to the federal gover nment,\ncourts apply the \"state action\" analysis set forth by the\nSupreme Court in Lugar v.

This\nargument is unavailing because it fails to allege a\ndeprivation of a right protected by the Constitution.\n\n                               16\n\fMoreover, the averment that defendants should be\nsubject to the mandates of the Constitution because their\nactivities have been allegedly approved by the federal\ngovernment through defendants' compliance with the\nLabeling Act is unconvincing. The mere fact that a tobacco\ncompany has complied with the requirements of a federal\nlaw cannot suffice to transform it into a federal actor any\nmore than the compliance of a myriad of private enterprises\nwith federal law and administrative regulations could of\nitself work such a transformation.2 Additionally, because\nthe alleged wrongdoing (the targeted advertising of\nmentholated tobacco products to African-Americans) is not\nrequired by the Labeling Act, it is difficult to view such\ntargeted advertising as federal action by defendants which\ncan serve as the basis for a Bivens action.\n\nThe second requirement of the Lugar analysis -- that the\nprivate party could in all fairness be r egarded as a federal\nactor -- may be met under one of three interr elated theories\nof government action: (i) the \"public function\" test, (ii) the\n\"close nexus\" test and (iii) the \"symbiotic relationship\" test.\nIn addition, Black Smokers discern in case law a fourth,\nmore synthetic \"totality of the circumstances\" test, the\nexistence of which is doubtful, as we explain infra.

Even if the\nactivities at issue extended, as Black Smokers suggest,\nbeyond the mere marketing and sale of mentholated\ntobacco products to the testing and labeling of such\nproducts, Black Smokers' argument would fail because it\nwould not meet the exclusivity requirement under the\npublic function test. Given that many products, including\nmentholated tobacco, are tested, marketed and labeled by\ntheir manufacturers, often in accordance with applicable\nregulatory requirements, such activities cannot be\ncharacterized as the exclusive prerogative of the\ngovernment. As the District Court noted, it is simply\ninaccurate to suggest that the testing, labeling and\nmarketing of cigarettes is the exclusive pr ovince of the\nfederal government. Finally, Black Smokers' averment that\ndefendants' compliance with various federal labeling\nrequirements transforms defendants into government\nactors is without support in applicable case law.

As with the public function\nanalysis, Black Smokers apparently discer n the purported\nnexus between the private action complained of and the\nfederal government in the operation of the Labeling Act.\nThey assert that the Labeling Act encourages tobacco\nmanufacturers to conceal the dangers of mentholated\ncigarettes, mandates inadequate warnings on such\nproducts and preempts most tort actions against\ndefendants. However, because the Labeling Act does not\ncompel, influence or encourage the actions upon which this\nsuit is based -- the targeted marketing of menthol\ncigarettes to African-Americans -- but rather only requires\nthe disclosure of certain risks on tobacco pr oduct\npackaging, defendants' conduct in compliance with the\nLabeling Act does not create the \"close nexus\" necessary for\na finding of state action.

See\nGoussis v. Kimball, 813 F.Supp. at 357.\n\nBlack Smokers' attempt to classify this case under the\n\"symbiotic relationship\" category of state action cases is\nsimilarly tenuous. In the seminal, albeit somewhat\nidiosyncratic, case of Burton v. Wilmington Parking Auth.,\nsupra, the Supreme Court held that a cof fee shop, which\nleased property located in a government owned parking\ngarage, was integrated with the parking facility as an\norganic part of the government operation and was party to\na mutually beneficial relationship with the government. Out\nof these facts arose the \"symbiotic r elationship test,\" which\n\n                               19\n\fasks whether the government has \"insinuated itself into a\nposition of interdependence\" with the defendant. Burton v.\nWilmington Parking Auth., 365 U.S. at 725.\n\nBlack Smokers' allegations concerning defendants'\nrelationship with the federal government prove both too\nlittle and too much; and in any case, they scar cely suffice\nto make out a \"symbiotic relationship\" within the meaning\nof Burton. Black Smokers aver that (i) the government\nbenefits from its relationship with defendants by virtue of\ncollecting \"enormous tax revenues\" from the tobacco\nindustry and (ii) the interests of the gover nment and\ndefendants are \"explicitly intertwined\" under the terms of\nthe Labeling Act, id. While these aver ments are\nundoubtedly true, they are inadequate to demonstrate\ngovernment action. Virtually all enterprises are subject to\ntax collection and, to varying degrees, to r egimes of\nadministrative regulation; were these attributes sufficient to\nsatisfy the test of Burton, substantially all businesses in the\ncountry would effectively become federal actors. See\nHadges v. Yonkers Racing Corp., 918 F .2d 1079, 1082 (2d\nCir. 1990). Moreover, although Burton retains much of its\nprecedential value, it should be noted that the Supreme\nCourt has recently cast some degree of doubt upon that\ndecision. In American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, supra,\nwhich reversed our finding that certain private insurance\ncompanies were to be regarded as state actors under\nBurton, the Supreme Court noted that \" Burton was one of\nour early cases dealing with `state action' under the\nFourteenth Amendment, and later cases have r efined the\nvague `joint participation' test embodied in that case.\" Id.,\n526 U.S. at 57 (citations omitted).3\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3.

The instant case is distinguishable from Crissman\nbecause in the latter case, which involved state-licensed harness racing\nand related gambling activities, state involvement extended far beyond\nregulation and revenue collection. In Crissman, the harness racing\noperator functioned as the state's agent with r espect to video lottery\noperations and was obligated to enforce a state statute relating to\nharness racing. See Crissman, ___ F.3d at ___ - ___ [Section III]. Such an\nagency relationship coupled with law enfor cement authority confers\nupon the operator attributes of government sovereignty wholly absent in\nthe federal government's regulation of tobacco manufacturers.\n\n                                20\n\fFinally, Black Smokers contend that an expansive, fact-\noriented \"totality of the circumstances\" approach to the\nquestion of government action exists wholly apart from the\nthree inquiries discussed supra and that such an approach\nis grounded in Third Circuit cases such as Sullivan v.\nBarnett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752420\"><a href=\"/opinion/752420/delores-scott-sullivan-william-battle-anthony-cancila-charles-matthews/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir . 1998), rev'd </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118268\"><a href=\"/opinion/118268/american-mfrs-mut-ins-co-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1999), and Mark v.

Although our cases place \"the factual context in\nwhich the case arises,\" Sullivan v.

Leesville Concr ete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112610\"><a href=\"/opinion/112610/edmonson-v-leesville-concrete-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991). Leaving aside the question whether the federal\ncourts have ever explicitly recognized Black Smokers'\n\"totality of the circumstances\" appr oach, the facts of the\ninstant case are readily distinguishable from those of\nEdmonson. In Edmonson, the Supreme Court held that\nlawyers' use of peremptory challenges was pursuant to a\ncourse of government action and consequently that any\nracially discriminatory use of such challenges violates\njurors' equal protection rights. Edmonson v. Leesville\nConcrete, 500 U.S. at 622-23. The sine qua non of the\nCourt's decision in Edmonson was the pr esence of\ngovernment involvement so pervasive in the context of the\nchallenged actions as to render such actions virtually\ninseparable from the participation of the gover nment. The\nEdmonson Court therefore emphasized that peremptory\nchallenges \"simply could not exist\" without the\ngovernment's \"significant participation.\" Id. at 622. The\nCourt went on to characterize the jury as \"a quintessential\ngovernment body, having no attributes of a private actor,\"\nid. at 624, and to note that peremptory challenges are\nperformed in the context of an inar guably \"traditional\ngovernment function\": trial by jury. Id . By contrast, in the\ninstant case, the federal government does not in any\n\n                               21\n\fmanner design, mandate or approve the alleged racially\ntargeted advertising of which Black Smokers complain,\nnotwithstanding the fact that such advertising is subject to\ncertain requirements and restrictions set forth in the\nLabeling Act. Black Smokers' insistence at oral ar gument\nthat the preemption of certain categories of tort actions by\nthe Labeling Act in some way constitutes the exer cise of a\ntraditional government function or significant governmental\nparticipation within the meaning of Edmonson is also\nwithout support in applicable precedent; indeed, such\npreemption provisions are commonplace in federal product\nsafety and information disclosure legislation. See, e.g.,\nFederal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1261 et seq.,\nnote (b)(1)(A); Moss v. Parks Corp., 985 F .2d 736, 739-41\n(4th Cir. 1993) (construing preemption provision of Federal\nHazardous Substances Act). Moreover , the marketing and\nadvertising practices of defendants, including their research\nand safety testing activities, are functions typical of various\nprivate enterprises and, even in light of the federal\nregulation to which such activities are subject under the\nLabeling Act and other legislation, are difficult to regard as\n\"traditional government function[s]\" within the meaning of\nEdmonson.\n\nE. SECTION 1985(3) CLAIM\n\nBlack Smokers' 42 U.S.C. S 1985(3) claims ar e deficient\nin several respects and consequently may be disposed of\nrelatively quickly. Section 1985(3) provides, in pertinent\npart:\n\n       If two or more persons in any State or T erritory\n       conspire, or go in disguise on the highway or on the\n       premises of another, for the purpose of depriving,\n       either directly or indirectly, any person or class of\n       persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal\n       privileges and immunities under the laws; . . .[and] in\n       any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one\n       or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be\n       done, any act in furtherance of the object of such\n       conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or\n       property, or deprived of having and exer cising any right\n       or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party\n\n                                22\n\f       so injured or deprived may have an action for r ecovery\n       of the damages, occasioned by such injury or\n       deprivation, against any one or more of the\n       conspirators.\n\n42 U.S.C. S 1985(3). In general, the conspiracy provision of\nS 1985(3) provides a cause of action under rather limited\ncircumstances against both private and state actors. In\norder successfully to bring an action underS 1985(3) for\nprivate conspiracy, a plaintiff must show, inter alia, \"(a)\nthat a racial or other class-based invidious discriminatory\nanimus lay behind the coconspirators' actions, (b) that the\ncoconspirators intended to deprive the victim of a right\nguaranteed by the Constitution against private impairment,\nand (c) that that right was consciously targeted and not\njust incidentally affected.\" Spencer v.

In light of\nthe overwhelming preponderance of authority on the\nquestion, this argument, too, must fail. Contrary to Black\nSmokers' claims, Bray does not support the proposition\nthat SS 1981 or 1982 claims can form the basis of a\nS 1985(3) claim or the notion that the contract and property\nrights protected by SS 1981 and 1982 fall within the\ncategory of \"involuntary servitude\" violations that may\nsupport a S 1985(3) claim. Isolated authority from the\nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia does exist in\nsupport of the theory that a S 1985(3) claim may be based\non a S 1981 claim. See Johnson v.

The District Court\ncorrectly held that Black Smokers' claims of racially\ntargeted advertising and marketing of mentholated tobacco\nproducts were inadequate to state a cause of action under\n42 U.S.C. SS 1981 and 1982. Because Black Smokers do\nnot demonstrate that defendants should be regar ded as\nstate actors, the District Court properly dismissed their\nclaims under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 as well. Finally, we will\naffirm the District Court's conclusion that Black Smokers\nfail to allege adequately that defendants ar e federal actors\nfor purposes of claims asserted either pursuant to Bivens or\ndirectly under the federal Constitution and that they fail to\nstate a cause of action under S 1985(3).\n\n                               25\n\fSHADUR, District Judge, Dissenting in part:\n\nWhat has been said in the majority opinion may pr operly\nbe viewed as having put forth the best possible case for\naffirmance of the District Court's dismissal of the Black\nSmokers' Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\"). But\nthat presentation, I believe, has despite itself highlighted\nthe basic flaws in such a threshold Fed. R. Civ. P. (\"Rule\")\n12(b)(6) dismissal. Accordingly I dissent fr om the portion of\nthe majority opinion that rejects Black Smokers' claims\nunder Sections 1981, 1982 and 1985(3) at the thr eshold of\nthe case.1\n\nBoth the panel majority and I necessarily pr oceed from\nthe seminal statement in Hishon v. King & Spalding, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111188\"><a href=\"/opinion/111188/hishon-v-king-spalding/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 (1984) of the quite undemanding bur den that\nRule 12(b)(6) imposes on a plaintiff 's complaint:\n\n       A court may dismiss a complaint only if it is clear that\n       no relief could be granted under any set of facts that\n       could be proved consistent with the allegations. Conley\n       v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45-46 (1957).\n\nAnd the majority opinion also correctly r ecognizes, though\nI fear it does not fairly apply, the proposition that all\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn fr om the\nallegations in the Complaint, as well as the allegations\nthemselves, must be accepted as true (Moor e v. Tartler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600746\"><a href=\"/opinion/600746/charles-e-moore-am-2804-v-hermann-tartler-board-secretary-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">986</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">682</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (3d Cir. 1993)).\n\nBecause we deal with a Complaint whose allegations\nmust thus be credited, there is no need to dwell at length\non the appalling record disclosed by Black Smokers'\npleading. Their 110-page 211-paragraph Complaint does\nnot comport with the Rule 8(a)(2) requir ement of \"a short\nand plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Because I agree that there is no pr edicate for ascribing state actor\nor\nfederal actor status to the tobacco companies or the other defendants, I\nconcur in the majority's rejection of Black Smokers' claims under Section\n1983 and under the Bivens line of authority. And while speaking of the\nother defendants, to simplify the ensuing discussion I will refer solely\nto\nthe defendant tobacco companies, for in my view any sorting out among\nthe defendants ought to be done by the district court on remand in light\nof what is said here.\n\n                                26\n\fis entitled to relief,\" but they can scar cely be faulted for\nwhat would normally be viewed as overkill in light of the\nundue judicial skepticism with which their ef fort has been\nmet. It is sufficient for present purposes to refer to the\nsubstantially higher carcinogenic effects of the tobacco\ncompanies' mentholated products, the use of which an\nextensively quoted 1998 Surgeon General's r eport and other\nmedical research discloses as having led to a much higher\nrate of lung cancer, pharyngeal cancer and other\nmalignancies among Blacks (Complaint PP80-91),\nphenomena that had been confirmed by the tobacco\ncompanies' own significant research (which the companies\nhad suppressed). And the Complaint further alleges that\ndespite that knowledge, the companies nevertheless\nengaged in extensive conduct that adversely impacted on\nBlack Smokers (id. PP48, 63), even including the actual\ndesign and introduction (though it was then abandoned in\nthe face of public outrage) of a mentholated pr oduct\nexpressly for Blacks (id. P45.c).\n\nIn that light, where I first part company with the majority\nopinion is in its having ruled as a matter of law \"that Black\nSmokers' allegations of racially targeted marketing of\nmentholated tobacco products cannot, in the absence of\nany disparity between the products sold to African-\nAmericans and the products sold to others, constitute a\ndeprivation of contract or property rights actionable under\nSS1981 or 1982.\" And my departure fr om that\nunsupportable proposition flows directly from the straw\nman first erected by the majority opinion when it says:\n\n       Black Smokers do not make the sort of claim that is\n       most readily actionable under the statute: that they\n       have been deprived by defendants of the right to\n       contract for, purchase, own or use either menthol or\n       non-menthol cigarettes.\n\nWhat must be understood instead is that both Section\n1981 and Section 1982 are not at all limited by their terms\nto the outright deprivation of the Black community's right\nto contract. Instead each of those statutes mandates an\nequal playing field that is violated by conduct that imposes\ndifferent and race-discriminatory conditions (however\ncreated) on the exercise of seemingly comparable\n\n                               27\n\fcontractual rights: Section 1981 guarantees to Black\nSmokers \"the same right . . . to make . .. contracts . . . as\nis enjoyed by white citizens,\" while Section 1982 assures to\nBlack Smokers \"the same right . . . as is enjoyed by white\ncitizens . . . to . . . purchase . . . personal property.\" And\nthat is the gravamen of the Complaint--that by the tobacco\ncompanies' deliberate and successful targeting of Black\nSmokers to persuade them to purchase and smoke the\nconcededly more dangerous menthol cigar ettes and\nsmokeless tobacco--conduct whose actionability is akin to\nthe prohibition of actual \"steering\" under the Fair Housing\nAct--those companies have impaired that equality of rights.\n\nNor should it avail the tobacco companies to attempt to\ntrot out \"freedom of contract\" principles. On the\nuncontested allegations of the Complaint, they have\ndeliberately suppressed the added perils cr eated by the\nmentholated products, concealing them fr om Black\nSmokers. And it just will not do for the tobacco companies\nto argue that they are somehow equal opportunity deceivers\n--that they have betrayed Whites and Blacks alike by their\ndeception. When their alleged concealment of the known\nrisks (known to them, that is) is coupled with their express\nefforts to maximize the sales of mentholated coffin nails\nand mentholated smokeless tobacco to Blacks, the\ninequality of treatment forbidden by Sections 1981 and\n1982 is demonstrated by the fairly-read Complaint.\n\nAnd this is not at all speculative. Defendants' r epeated\n(and it must be said hypocritical) emphasis on the fact that\n69% of the mentholated products are used by non-Blacks\nis as deceptive as their historical conduct of denying the\nextraordinarily harmful effects of nicotine generally and of\nmenthol in particular. What that repeated emphasis glosses\nover is the enormous disparity between the 10+% of the\npopulation represented by Blacks and the Black Smokers'\n31%2 consumption of the menthol cigarettes. It will be\nrecalled that the rule of thumb for demonstrating\ndiscrimination has been recognized in these ter ms for a\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. As the majority opinion indicates, 31% is the most charitable (to the\ntobacco companies) of the numbers reflected by statistics cited in the\nComplaint. Other studies put that number as high as 61.5% and 66%.\n\n                               28\n\fquarter century (Castaneda v. Partida, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496-\n97 n.17 (1976)):\n\n       As a general rule for such large samples, if the\n       difference between the expected value and the observed\n       number is more than 2 or 3 standard deviations, then\n       the hypothesis that the difference was random will be\n       suspect to a social scientist.\n\nTwo standard deviations equate to a 5% likelihood of\nchance distribution. And by contrast the probability that a\n10% versus 31% disparity is a matter of mere chance\nrepresents, as an approximation (and essentially a\nconservative one) of the normal distribution, some 7\nstandard deviations--producing a figur e so small as to\nbeggar the imagination: 1.28 in a trillion. 3\n\nThat extraordinary imbalance (truly an understatement,\nfor such a huge disparity is almost beyond human\ncomprehension) really cuts the legs out fr om under the\nmajority opinion's attempt to distinguish the decision in\nRoper v. Edwards, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"486489\"><a href=\"/opinion/486489/jessie-roper-individually-joe-roper-individually-and-joe-roper-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">815</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1987) by\nstating:\n\n       One might argue that if racially directed marketing of\n       menthol cigarettes resulted in a situation in which\n       virtually all mentholated tobacco products wer e\n       consumed by African-Americans and substantially all\n       non-mentholated tobacco products by others, that case\n       might come within the sweep of Roper. However, Black\n       Smokers have not alleged such a situation.\n\nIn real world terms there is no conceptual difference\nbetween the notion that \"virtually all mentholated tobacco\nproducts were consumed by African-Americans\" and the\nsituation in which that group's comparative consumption is\nso close to 100% of total consumption in the meaningful\nstatistical sense.\n\nIt is surely unreasonable to ascribe such an enormous\ndisparity to chance rather than to the purposeful steering\nthat has been alleged by Black Smokers--at a minimum,\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. That figure is derived from William Knight, Tables of the Normal\nDistribution, at http://www.math.unb.ca/~knight/utility/NormTble.htm.\n\n                                29\n\fthey should be allowed their day in court to pr ove that\nracial animus may reasonably be inferred from the tobacco\ncompanies' deliberate targeting of African-Americans as\ntheir far-preferred targets of the more dangerous products\nat issue. There is no question that even the far, far smaller\nbut still statistically significant disparity of two standard\ndeviations suffices to warrant an inference of intentional\ndiscrimination--see, e.g., such cases as Smith v. Xerox\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766733\"><a href=\"/opinion/766733/john-b-smith-harold-wado-john-s-bernhard-philip-d-cufari-salvatore/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365-66 (2d Cir . 1999).\n\nNor I suggest will it do (as the tobacco companies have\nurged and as the majority opinion has cr edited) to say that\nBlack Smokers cannot complain about that deliberate\nsteering because Blacks were already pr edisposed to prefer\nthe mentholated products. We are after all dealing with the\ncase at its very outset. Nothing has been shown--because\nno opportunity has been given to Black Smokers--as to\nwhether that preference was itself the pr oduct of the same\nkind of improper steering at the outset, or even if not, as to\nwhether the earlier preference even began to approach (let\nalone to account for) the enormous disparity that now\nexists (a showing that might for example be accomplished,\nagain to deal with statistical probabilities, through the\napplication of multiple regression analysis).\n\nIn response to Black Smokers' uncontroverted allegations\nabout the tobacco companies' purposeful steering of their\nknown extra-harmful mentholated products to the African-\nAmerican market, the majority opinion accepts the\nargument that this was no more than conventional\nadvertising, something that Jones v.

Mayer Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107748\"><a href=\"/opinion/107748/jones-v-alfred-h-mayer-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413 (1968) characterized as nonactionable\nunder Section 1982. But Jones v. Mayer, id. said only this\nin the course of announcing for the first time that Section\n1982 applies to private as well as public racial\ndiscrimination in the sale of property (a statement made in\nthe course of contrasting that statute with the full-bore\nopen housing law that was then brand new on the books):\n\n       It [Section 1982] does not prohibit advertising or\n       other representations that indicate discriminatory\n       preferences.\n\nThat sanitization of mere statements of discriminatory\npreferences does not control her e, however, for when such\n\n                                30\n\fdiscriminatory preferences are translated into\ndiscriminatory action, as is alleged her e (and as we must\ncredit), the actor cannot fairly be insulated from the impact\nof Section 1982 (or of Section 1981) by asserting that its\nadvertising was a means by which it accomplished that\nforbidden end.\n\nIndeed, that is precisely the thrust of the eloquent\nopinion by the late Judge Luther Swygert in Clark v.\nUniversal Builders, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir . 1974), which\nfound support rather than a lack of support in Jones v.\nMayer, but which the majority opinion seeks to distinguish\nbecause the sales of housing to Black purchasers in Clark\nwere on more onerous terms than the sales to non-Blacks.\nBut once again I suggest that the attempted distinction is\nhollow--that defendants' conduct set out in the Complaint\nin this case effectively created the same type of separate,\nracially-segregated market as was found actionable in\nClark. Such cases as Village of Bellwood v. Dwivedi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536509\"><a href=\"/opinion/536509/village-of-bellwood-v-chandra-dwivedi/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1525, 1529 (7th Cir. 1990) teach that racial\nsteering is forbidden both by Section 1982 and by the Fair\nHousing Act (each of which was implicated ther e)--and of\ncourse Section 1982 is not limited to anti-Black\ndiscrimination in housing, as is the Fair Housing Act.4\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Even brief reflection on what Jones v. Mayer did not say, as well as on\nwhat it did say, demonstrates that the majority opinion loads that\nopinion's single sentence quoted above with mor e baggage than it can\nreasonably carry. Just as there is nothing actionable (for example) in the\nseller of clothing deciding that it wishes to expand its market by\ndepicting Black as well as White models in its clothing ads, so too a\nmere indication of racial preferences in advertising is not actionable as\nsuch under Section 1982. But what I believe is just as obviously\nprohibited by that statute is using such advertising to deny Blacks the\nsame treatment as Whites--the rights to contract and to purchase under\nthe same conditions--by deliberately subjecting Blacks to the far greater\nimpact of the seriously (often fatally) deleterious effects of the\nadvertised\nproduct--effects well known to but undisclosed by the tobacco\ncompanies. And as for the majority opinion's ef fort to distinguish Clark\nv. Universal Builders, it is necessarily appar ent (though it was\nundiscussed because not placed into issue ther e) that the Black\npurchasers in that case were the victims of sales of substandard housing\n--in violation of Section 1982--that had to be accomplished through\nadvertising. After all, the alternative pr emise of assuming that those\n\n                               31\n\fFinally, what of the required showing of racial animus? Is\nit a defense for the tobacco companies to ur ge that their\npattern of general concealment and deception r eflected\nnothing more than a free market desir e to make profit, and\nthat their targeting of Black Smokers was nothing more\nthan a desire to maximize those profits because the Blacks\nwere most vulnerable to the most deleterious pr oducts?\nAgain, unlawfully discriminatory intent under the\ndiscrimination laws generally has been recognized as\nreasonably inferable from far less evidence of disparate\nimpact--should any different principle apply here? Once\nmore the tobacco companies' callous indif ference to\nsmokers' health has been demonstrably more marked\ntoward Black Smokers--that is the combined ef fect (1) of\nthe tobacco companies' knowledge (and their concealment\nof that knowledge) about the special deadliness of the\nmentholated products that they have been marketing and\n(2) of their express targeting of those products toward the\nAfrican-American community.\n\nIt is not of course my purpose to express any conclusion\nas to the existence or nonexistence of the pr ohibited intent.\nInstead the focus of this opinion is to stress the\nrequirement that, as with all other factual issues, intent\nmust be resolved by a factfinding jury (or perhaps by a\njudge in the summary judgment context of Rule 56, rather\nthan at the preliminary pleading stage under Rule 12(b)(6),\nwhere plaintiffs' allegations must be accepted as true). And\nto that end I find it particularly poignant that we deal here\nwith a group of defendants whose industry is centered in\nan area where Blacks were once chattels, viewed as\nsubhuman--again ironically in terms of the present\nlitigation, chattels whose slave labor was r esponsible in\nlarge part for the economic success of the tobacco industry.\nEven though a century and a half has elapsed since that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsales were spontaneously generated would r equire turning the aphorism\ncredited to Emerson on its head to read:\n\n       If a man can make a worse mouse-trap than his neighbor, though\n       he builds his house in the woods the world will make a beaten path\n       to his door.\n\n                               32\n\fmindset was supposed to have been eliminated by the Civil\nWar and by the post-War Civil Rights Acts (including\nSections 1981 and 1982), all of us know that the r eality of\nracial prejudice has unfortunately long outlived the theory\nembodied in those statutes. Whether any such pr ejudice\nhas been at work here should not, I believe, be resolved on\na threshold determination of the likelihood or unlikelihood\nof Black Smokers' ability to prove their allegations in that\nrespect.\n\nWe would do well to remember what Justice O'Connor\n(speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court on this issue)\nsaid in rejecting the threshold dismissal of a pro se\nprisoner's complaint because of a judicial view that its\nallegations were unlikely (Denton v. Her nandez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112729\"><a href=\"/opinion/112729/denton-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33 (1992)):\n\n       Some improbable allegations might properly be\n       disposed of on summary judgment, but to dismiss\n       them as frivolous without any factual development is to\n       disregard the age-old insight that many allegations\n       might be \"strange, but true; for truth is always strange,\n       Stranger than fiction.\" Lord Byron, Don Juan, canto\n       XIV, stanza 101 (T. Steffan, E. Steffan, & W. Pratt eds.\n       1977).\n\nBlack Smokers are surely entitled to no less, where their\nfactual assertions are so solidly supported (and not in the\nleast fanciful), and where the perceived problems with their\nComplaint really represent skepticism as to their ability to\nprove causation and intent--classic issues of fact to be\nresolved by a factfinding jury and not by judicial\nprescreening.\n\nIn sum, I suggest that cutting Black Smokers of f before\nthey have had the opportunity to demonstrate that they can\ndeliver as advertised5 in their Complaint does violence to\nthe fundamental principles of judicial reading of\ncomplaints, as acknowledged both in the majority opinion\nand in this dissent.
