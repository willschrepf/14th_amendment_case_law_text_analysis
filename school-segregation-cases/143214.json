HHS claims that the\n\ninformation is properly withheld under FOIA’s Exemption Four because the release of the\n\ninformation would cause substantial competitive harm to the private health insurance companies\n\nthat submitted the requested data to HHS in 2010 and would impair HHS’s ability to obtain\n\naccurate information in the future.\n\n       Before the Court is defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 20, April 30,\n\n2012, and plaintiff’s Cross Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 24, July 13, 2012. Upon\n\nconsideration of defendant’s motion, plaintiff’s cross motion and opposition, defendant’s reply\n\nand opposition, ECF No. 27, Aug. 13, 2012, plaintiff’s reply, ECF No. 30, Sept. 10, 2012, the\n\napplicable law, and the record herein, the Court will DENY defendant’s motion and GRANT\n\nplaintiff’s motion.\n\fI.     BACKGROUND\n\n       On July 18, 2011, plaintiff Dr. Biles—a professor at The George Washington University\n\nSchool of Public Health and Health Services who studies the Medicare Advantage (“MA”)\n\nprogram—filed a FOIA request with defendant HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nServices (“CMS”), which oversees the Medicare Advantage (“MA”) program. Pl.’s Mem. in\n\nOpp’n to Def.’s M. Summ. J. & in Supp. of Pl.’s M. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) 2, ECF No. 24-1;\n\nBiles Decl. ¶ 1, Exh. A (CV), ECF No. 24-2; Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Def.’s M. Summ. J.\n\n(“Def.’s Mem.”) 4, ECF No. 20. In order to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the MA\n\nand Medicare programs, Dr. Biles requested “specific data and other information for 2009\n\nprovided to CMS, in or about June 2010, by all Medicare Part C Medicare Advantage\n\nOrganizations on WORKSHEET 1—MA BASE PERIOD EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTION\n\nASSUMPTIONS.” Pl.’s Complaint ¶ 1; Def.’s Mem. 4; Biles Decl. Ex. F, at 1 (FOIA Request).\n\n       Medicare Advantage organizations (“MAOs”) are private insurance companies that offer\n\nhealth insurance coverage to Medicare beneficiaries and are required, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. §\n\n422.254, to submit a Bid Pricing Tool to CMS by the first Monday of June each year. Rice Decl.\n\n¶¶ 5, 7–9, ECF No. 20-1; Pl.’s Mem. 2. The Bid Pricing Tool is an Excel workbook comprised\n\nof seven worksheets of data that determine the projected costs and revenue for an MAO to\n\nprovide coverage to MA beneficiaries in the next calendar year. Def.’s Mem. 4; Pl.’s Mem. 1–3;\n\nRice Decl. ¶¶ 5–7, 12.    The “bid” submitted by MAOs is not like a traditional bid in a\n\ncompetitive arena where one winner takes all, as in bids for government contracts. Pl.’s Mem. 7.\n\nCMS explains:\n\n       [T]he MA . . . program[] [is] not competitive in the way that term is normally\n       understood. Although [MAOs] do compete for members, primarily through the\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        benefits offered and the cost (member cost sharing and premium) of those\n        benefits, they do not directly compete for the payments that CMS makes. 1\n\nCMS “approve[s] all sustainable bids that are otherwise qualified without preference for the\n\nlowest bidder.” 2 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518.\n\n        Further unlike a competitive bid for a contract where the bidder can choose his desired\n\nbid amount, an MAO’s “bid” is based on the MAO’s actual costs expended by the MAO in the\n\nprevious year to provide its offered Medicare benefits; this data is called the MAO’s “base\n\nperiod” data and is the category from which Dr. Biles has requested specific data. Pl.’s Mem. 7;\n\nsee Rice Decl. ¶ 6. Base period data must be verified by an actuary. Pl.’s Mem. 15, 42; Rice\n\nDecl. ¶ 12; 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518 (statement by CMS/HHS) (“Utilization, costs, and trends must\n\nbe certified by a qualified, independent actuary prior to bid submission.”); 42 C.F.R. §\n\n422.254(b)(5) (2012).\n\n        Ultimately, the “bid” data is trended forward to the next year by a series of formulae, like\n\ninflation and other factors, embedded in the seven Excel worksheets of the Bid Pricing Tool.\n\nPl.’s Mem. 7; see Rice Decl. ¶ 6; 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,517. The formulae calculate the bid data to\n\ndetermine the expected revenue needed to cover the MAO’s projected Medicare costs for the\n\nnext year. Pl.’s Mem. 7; Rice Decl. ¶ 6; 42 C.F.R. § 422.245(a)(1) (2012). This “payment plan”\n\nis the basis for CMS’s payments to an MAO, and CMS pays MAOs one year in advance to cover\n\nits portion of the MAOs’ projected cost and revenue requirements for the next year. See id; Rice\n\n1\n  Medicare Program; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for\nContract Year 2012 and Other Changes, 76 Fed. Reg. 21,432, 21,518 (Apr. 15, 2011) (final rule) (CMS/HHS\nresponding to and refuting claims by MAOs that some of the payment data collected by the bidding process should\nnot be released to the public due to a risk of competitive harm).\n2\n CMS “may decline to approve a bid if the [MAO] proposes significant increases in cost sharing or decreases in\nbenefits offered under the plan” and CMS may only approve bids where (1) “[t]he bid amount and proportions are\nsupported by the actuarial bases provided by [the MAO],” (2) “[t]he bid amount and proportions reasonably and\nequitably reflects the plan’s estimated revenue requirements for providing the benefits under that plan,” (3) the bid\nplaces limitations on enrollee cost sharing, and (4) the bid’s benefit package and plan costs are “substantially\ndifferent from [the MAO’s] other bid submissions . . . of [the same] plan type with respect to premiums, benefits, or\ncost-sharing structure.” 42 C.F.R. § 422.256(a)–(b) (2012).\n\n                                                         3\n\fDecl. ¶¶ 6–11; Pl.’s Mem. 7; 42 C.F.R. § 422.254(a)(1) (2012). For example, an MAO’s 2011\n\npayment plan is based on 2009 actuarial data. See Pl.’s Mem. 7; Rice Decl. ¶ 12.\n\n        Additionally, while the payment plan is determined according to the MAO’s estimated\n\ninternal costs, the payment amount is limited by a federally-set benchmark, which is the\n\nmaximum amount CMS will pay an MAO in a given locality.                             See 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-\n\n23(b)(1)(B) (2012); 42 C.F.R. § 422.258 (2012). The benchmarks are publicly announced by the\n\nfirst Monday in April of the year prior to the bid submissions to which the benchmarks will\n\napply. 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-23(b)(1)(B).\n\n        Dr. Biles requested “retroactive,” “historical” cost and utilization data from Sections I, II,\n\nIII, and VI of Worksheet One 3 of the Bid Pricing Tool and claims to have not requested any data\n\nthat “disclose[s] MAO assumptions, predictions, projections, or expectations for how th[o]se\n\ncosts may change in the future.” Pl.’s Mem. 8; Def.’s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1; Def.’s Mem 4\n\n(“Def.’s Statement of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute”) ¶ 3; Biles Decl. ¶¶ 58–60, 95.\n\nSection I was released to Dr. Biles by CMS and is therefore not in dispute. Biles Decl. ¶ 96;\n\nDef.’s M. Summ. J. Exs. 1–3, Ex. 4 at 2. Sections II, III, and VI are in dispute, as CMS refuses\n\nto disclose those sections in their entirety pursuant to FOIA’s Exemption Four. Pl.’s Mem. 3,\n\nExs. 3–4; Marquis Decl. ¶¶ 21–27, ECF No. 20-2.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  Worksheet One of the Bid Pricing Tool requires an MAO to submit the following information from the prior year:\n(1) member months (the number of months each enrollee was enrolled in the plan during the year; (2) risk score (an\nindicator of the risk profile, or cost potential, of the enrolled population); (3) plan list (what type of plans are\nincluded in the reporting); (4) utilization by service area (how many times enrollees received each service); (5)\naverage cost by service category; (6) projection factors; (7) revenue from CMS and enrollee premiums; (8)\nadministrative costs. Rice Decl. ¶ 6. Dr. Biles has requested only some of these categories of information. Pl.’s\nMem. 3, Exs. 3–4; Marquis Decl. ¶¶ 21–27.\n\n\n                                                         4\n\f           Section II contains base period background information that defines the period of time\n\nthat Section III data 4 reflects and includes the “Paid Through Date,” 5 “Member Months,” 6 and\n\nthe “Non ESRD Risk Score,” 7 along with other background data. Biles Decl. ¶ 97–107.\n\n           Section III is retrospective 2009 cost and utilization data for various types of health\n\nservices the MAO covers in its offered plans. Biles Decl. ¶ 108. Section III includes the rates\n\nthat each service was utilized during 2009 and automatically populates the average cost per\n\nutilization. Biles Decl. ¶¶ 111–12. Section III also provides the costs per member per month\n\n(“PMPM”) by service category for the base period; the total PMPM costs for a type of health\n\nservice are the result of three factors—the price paid for services, the quantity of services used,\n\nand the intensity of services (the extent that highly expensive new technology was used). Biles\n\nDecl. ¶¶ 112–13.\n\n           Section VI reflects the MAO’s revenue for the calendar year as well as non-benefit\n\nexpenses, like internal operating costs, that were required to provide the services described in\n\nSection III for the 2009 calendar year. Biles Decl. ¶ 114.\n\n\n\n\n4\n The experience data is based on costs incurred for providing MA benefits during calendar year 2009. Biles Decl. ¶\n97.\n5\n    This is the date in 2010 through which the MAO has paid its 2009 claims. Biles Decl. ¶ 98.\n6\n    This is the number of months each enrollee was covered by the MAO plan during 2009. Biles Decl. ¶ 99.\n7\n  This is a projected risk score upon which the 2010 payment plan was based. Biles Decl. ¶¶ 103–05. A risk score\nis essentially the health of the MAO’s enrollee population and is used to adjust CMS’s payment to an MAO based\non their beneficiaries’ health. Id. A “Non ESRD” risk score means the risk score of the MAO’s enrollees that does\nnot includes ESRD (“End Stage Renal Disease”) enrollees. However, ESRD Medicare beneficiaries are generally\nprohibited by CMS from joining MAO plans, and ESRD patients comprise only 0.9 % of all Medicare beneficiaries.\nBiles Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 38–39, ECF No. 30-1. Thus, the Non ESRD Risk Score appears to be, for all practical\npurposes, the projected risk score of an MAO upon which the MAO’s payment plan is based. Id.\n\n\n                                                           5\n\fII.    LEGAL STANDARD\n\n       A.      Summary Judgment\n\n       “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that (1) there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a) (emphasis added); see Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\n\n247 (1986). The mere existence of any factual dispute will not defeat summary judgment; the\n\nrequirement is that there be no genuine dispute about a material fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. 247–\n\n48. A fact is material if, under the applicable law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Id. A\n\ndispute is genuine if the “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\n\nnonmoving party.” Id. In order for the dispute to be genuine, a nonmoving party must present\n\nenough specific facts, beyond mere allegations or conclusory statements, that would enable a\n\nreasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmoving party. Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; Greene v.\n\nDalton, 164 F.3d 671, 675 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Because the court cannot try issues of fact when\n\ndetermining summary judgment but can only determine whether there are issues to be tried, the\n\nnonmoving party’s evidence is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the\n\nnonmoving party’s favor. Id. at 255; see Freeman v. Continental Gin Co., 381 F.2d 459, 469\n\n(5th Cir. 1967).\n\n       The court must find that the movant is entitled to “judgment as a matter of law” in order\n\nto grant summary judgment, Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), and therefore must find that there is no\n\ngenuine issue for trial. There is no genuine issue for trial unless the nonmoving party provides\n\nsufficient favorable evidence to enable a jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 250–51 (explaining that the summary judgment inquiry is whether “there\n\nare any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fmay reasonably be resolved in favor of either party,” agreeing that the standard for summary\n\njudgment mirrors the standard for a directed verdict under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 50(a), and\n\ninstructing that “[i]f reasonable minds could differ as to the import of the evidence . . . a verdict\n\n[or a summary judgment] should not be directed [or granted]”). The burden is on the moving\n\nparty to show that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party’s case.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986).\n\n       If the moving party would have the burden of persuasion at trial, the moving party must\n\nprovide enough credible evidence to show that it is entitled to a directed verdict if not\n\ncontroverted at trial, which shifts the burden to the nonmoving party to show, by credible\n\nevidence, that a “genuine issue” exists.       477 U.S. at 331 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (not\n\ninconsistent with the majority opinion); see 10A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2727 (Charles Alan\n\nWright et al. eds., 3d ed. 2012). If the moving party would not have the burden of persuasion at\n\ntrial, the moving party may satisfy Rule 56’s burden of production by either submitting evidence\n\nthat negates an essential element of the nonmoving party’s claim so that the nonmoving party\n\ncannot meet their required burden of production or by affirmatively showing that there is no\n\nevidence on the record to support a judgment for the nonmoving party. Celotex, 477 U.S. at\n\n331–32 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (not inconsistent with the majority opinion); see 10A Fed. Prac.\n\n& Proc. Civ. § 2727 (Charles Alan Wright et al. eds., 3d ed. 2012).\n\n       FOIA cases are typically and appropriately decided by summary judgment. Brayton v.\n\nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative, 641 F.3d 521, 527 (D.C. Cir. 2011). By statute, the\n\nagency bears the burden in litigation to justify withholding any records. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4).\n\nThis is in part because of the “strong presumption in favor of disclosure,” Dep’t. of State v. Ray,\n\n502 U.S. 164, 173 (1991), and because FOIA requesters face an information asymmetry given\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fthat the agency possesses the requested information and decides whether it should be withheld\n\nor disclosed. See Judicial Watch, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 141, 145–46 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus,\n\neven where the requester has moved for summary judgment, the Government “‘ultimately [has]\n\nthe onus of proving that the [documents] are exempt from disclosure.’” Pub. Citizen Health\n\nResearch Grp. v. FDA, 185 F.3d 898, 904–05 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (quoting Nat’l Ass’n of Gov’t\n\nEmps. v. Campbell, 593 F.2d 1023, 1027 (D.C. Cir. 1978)).              To show an exemption’s\n\napplicability, an agency may rely on reasonably detailed and non-conclusory declarations to\n\nsatisfy its burden of production. See McGehee v. CIA, 697 F.2d 1095, 1102 (D.C. Cir. 1983);\n\nMilitary Audit Project v. Casey, 656 F.2d 724, 738 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“[I]t is now well\n\nestablished that summary judgment on the basis of such agency affidavits is warranted if the\n\naffidavits describe the documents and the justifications for nondisclosure with reasonably\n\nspecific detail, demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed\n\nexemption, and are not controverted by either contrary evidence in the record nor by evidence of\n\nagency bad faith.”); Morley v. CIA, 508 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“‘Conclusory and\n\ngeneralized allegations of exemptions’ are unacceptable.” ) (citations omitted).\n\n       B.      Freedom of Information Act\n\n       The Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552 (2012), generally provides\n\nthat any person has a statutory right, enforceable in court, to obtain access to executive branch\n\nfederal agency records, except to the extent that such records, or portions of them, are protected\n\nfrom public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or by one of three additional special law\n\nenforcement record exclusions. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (2012); Newport Aeronautical Sales v.\n\nDep’t of Air Force, 684 F.3d 160, 162 (D.C. Cir. 2012). The Supreme Court noted that “[t]he\n\nbasic purpose of [the] FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fdemocratic society, needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to\n\nthe governed.” NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978). Exemptions\n\n“must be narrowly construed” so that the “limited exemptions do not obscure the basic policy\n\nthat disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act.” John Doe Agency v. John Doe\n\nCorp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989).\n\n       The FOIA exemptions exemplify various policy interests that conflict with and ultimately\n\nsupersede the basic FOIA policies of government transparency and an informed citizenry. John\n\nDoe, 493 U.S. at 152 (“‘Congress realized that legitimate governmental and private interests\n\ncould be harmed by release of certain types of information,’ and therefore provided the ‘specific\n\nexemptions under which disclosure could be refused.’”) (citing FBI v. Abramson, 456 U.S. 615,\n\n621 (1982)). An agency seeking to withhold information under a FOIA exemption has the\n\nburden of proving that the information falls under the claimed exemption, and the district court\n\nmust review the agency’s decision de novo. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B); Quinon v. FBI, 86 F.3d\n\n1222, 1227 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Further, “[i]f a document contains exempt information, the agency\n\nmust still release ‘any reasonably segregable portion’ after deletion of the nondisclosable\n\nportions.” Oglesby v. U.S. Dep’t of the Army, 79 F.3d 1172, 1176 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (citing 5\n\nU.S.C. § 552(b)). To ensure that all reasonably segregable information has been disclosed to the\n\nrequester, the district court is required to enter a finding on segregability, even if the issue of\n\nsegregability has not been raised by the plaintiff. Trans-Pacific Policing Agreement v. U.S.\n\nCustoms Serv., 177 F.3d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\n       Exemption Four to FOIA exempts from disclosure some information relating to trade\n\nsecrets or commercial or financial information. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4) (2012). For Exemption\n\nFour to apply, the information must (1) involve trade secrets and commercial or financial\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\finformation, (2) be obtained from a person outside the government, and (3) be privileged or\n\nconfidential. Id. Exemption Four was drafted to balance the strong public interest in favor of\n\ndisclosure against the right of private businesses to protect sensitive information. National Parks\n\n& Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 768–69 (D.C. Cir. 1974); see Worthington\n\nCompressors, Inc. v. Costle, 662 F.2d 45, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (“‘[A]s a matter basic to our free\n\nenterprise system, private business information should be afforded appropriate protection, at\n\nleast from competitors.”).     Under Exemption Four, documents or information that the\n\ngovernment requires an entity to provide are less rigorously protected than documents or\n\ninformation voluntarily provided to the government by the entity. Critical Mass Energy Project\n\nv. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 975 F.2d 871, 878–880 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (en banc) (creating the\n\ntwo tests for “voluntary” and “required” information and assigning the above-stated National\n\nParks test to the analysis for “required” information); see also National Parks, 498 F.2d at 766.\n\nIII.   DISCUSSION\n\n       For Exemption Four to apply, the information must (1) involve trade secrets or\n\ncommercial or financial information, (2) be obtained from a person outside the government, and\n\n(3) be privileged or confidential. National Parks, 498 F.2d at 766. It is undisputed that the\n\ninformation in this case is financial or commercial and was obtained from a “person” outside of\n\nthe government, and HHS has not claimed that the information is privileged. Pl.’s Mem. 18;\n\nDef.’s Mem. 12–13. Thus, the only disputed issue is whether or not the requested information is\n\nconfidential. Id.\n\n       To determine whether information is confidential, the court must first determine whether\n\nthe information was submitted to the government voluntarily or whether the government required\n\nthe information to be submitted. See Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878–80. A submission is\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\fcompelled when the government requires a private party to submit information as a condition of\n\ndoing business with the government. See Lepelletier v. F.D.I.C., 977 F. Supp. 456, 460 n.3\n\n(D.D.C. 1997), rev’d in part on other grounds, 164. F.3d 37 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (“Information is\n\nconsidered ‘required’ if any legal authority compels its submission, including informal mandates\n\nthat call for the submission of the information as a condition of doing business with the\n\ngovernment”); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank, 108 F. Supp. 2d 19, 28 (D.D.C. 2000). In\n\nthe present case, because the requested data is required by law to be submitted to CMS by all\n\nparticipating MAOs, 42 C.F.R. § 422.254 (2012), the National Parks test for “required\n\ninformation” applies. Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878–80.\n\n       Under National Parks, information is confidential if its disclosure is likely to (1) “impair\n\nthe Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future” or (2) “cause substantial\n\nharm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.” Nat’l\n\nParks, 498 F.2d at 770; see Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878. Here, HHS contends that both\n\nprongs of the test are satisfied as a matter of law (though HHS need only prove one of the prongs\n\nto prevail) and that there are no genuine issues of material fact, thus requesting summary\n\njudgment in its favor. Def.’s Mem. 1, 14–21. Dr. Biles contends that HHS has not met its\n\nburden of proving with affirmative, non-conclusory evidence that Exemption Four applies in this\n\ncase and therefore requests summary judgment in his favor. Pl.’s Mem. 28.\n\n       A.     Impairment to Government’s Ability to Obtain Information in the Future\n\n       Because all MAOs are required by statute to submit the requested data to CMS in order to\n\nparticipate as an MAO the following year, the Government will continue to be able to obtain the\n\ndata required by the mandatory Bid Pricing Tool submission even if the requested data is\n\ndisclosed. Private companies participate as MAOs because it is profitable to them, and neither\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fan MAO official nor HHS has suggested that an MAO would refuse to participate in the MA\n\nprogram if the requested data were released. See Pl.’s Mem. 21–22; Biles Decl. ¶ 33; Rice Decl.\n\n¶¶ 9–10. See generally Rice Decl.; Marquis Decl.; Yiu Decl., ECF No. 27-5; Smith Decl., ECF\n\nNo. 27-4; Theisen Decl., ECF No. 27-3; Rice Supp. Decl., ECF No 27-2.\n\n        Because HHS will continue to be able to obtain the required data, HHS focuses on the\n\nquality of the data the Government will be able to obtain. HHS claims that the disclosure of the\n\nrequested information will cause MAOs to adjust their bids in order to compete with other\n\nMAOs’ bids or to keep other MAOs from “decipher[ing] their bids,” which would deprive CMS\n\nof the detailed and reliable information it now obtains. Def.’s Mem. 18–20; Rice Decl. ¶¶ 24–\n\n25. Dr. Biles disputes these claims, noting that “[i]f an MAO wishes to participate, but fails to\n\nprovide the voluminous and detailed information required on the Bid Pricing Tool [and abide by\n\nthe actuarial requirements], CMS is empowered not only to decline to renew their contract, but\n\nalso to impose sanctions.” Pl.’s Mem. 22 (citing 42 CFR § 422.254(a)(3)).\n\n        HHS fails to explain (1) how bids could be manipulated by MAOs by using the requested\n\ndata when the Bid Pricing Tool requires actuary-verified data and other strict structural\n\nrequirements that cannot be modified without serious consequences 8 and (2), even if MAOs were\n\nable to adjust their bids in some material way, how those adjustments would impair CMS’s\n\nability to obtain the information required by 42 C.F.R. § 422.254 in the future—as mere changes\n\nin the bid amounts do not necessarily equate to inaccurate data or CMS’s inability to obtain the\n\n\n\n\n8\n  For example, CMS can impose sanctions or choose not to renew a contract, 42 C.F.R. § 422.254(a)(3), or, worse,\nthe MAO could be subject to penalties for misrepresentation in contracting with the government under the False\nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–30 (2012). See also 42 C.F.R. § 422.254(b)(5) (a qualified actuary must certify the\nplan’s actuarial valuation); § 422.256(b)(1) (CMS can only accept applications if the “bid amount and proportions\nare supported by the actuarial bases provided.”); 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-27(d)(1) (2012) (CMS is required to audit the\nfinancial records (including cost and utilization data) of at least one-third of all MAOs each year.).\n\n                                                       12\n\frequired information in the future. 9 See Gov’t Accountability Project v. HHS, 691 F. Supp. 2d\n\n170, 175–76, 178–79 (D.D.C. 2010) (agency failed to show “how” data resulted in claimed\n\nresults).\n\n         CMS claims that “[d]isclosure of the requested information would undermine the\n\nintegrity of the bidding process.” Def.’s Mem. 19. But in a 2010 response to MAOs that were\n\nclaiming the exact same thing (that the release of certain payment data would undermine the\n\nintegrity of the bidding process), CMS claimed that there was no risk of loss to the integrity of\n\nthe bidding process, not because of the type of data that was being released, but because the\n\nbidding process consisted of actuary-verified data: “Utilization, costs, and trends must be\n\ncertified by a qualified, independent actuary prior to bid submission. Since we will continue to\n\nrequire actuarial certification, integrity is unaffected.” 75 Fed. Reg. 21,432, 21,518. HHS fails\n\nto dispute Dr. Biles’s claim that “plans cannot simply raise bids strategically [or] willy-nilly\n\n[because] [t]here must be an actuarial basis for doing so.” Pl.’s Mem. 54. HHS offers “nothing\n\nbut speculative opinion that [MAOs] may not be forthcoming in the data they submit if [HHS]\n\nallows disclosure . . ., [though] the agency has the burden of showing that requested information\n\n\n\n9\n  Further, CMS does not explain how changes in the MAOs’ bid amounts would pose a threat to the MA program\nwhen CMS has a benchmark amount over which CMS will not pay an MAO and when MAOs have strong\nincentives to remain competitive (and thus, keep their costs down and their enrollee benefits up in order to attract\nenrollees). Def.’s Mem. 20; Rice Decl. ¶ 26; 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518 (“The fact that MA-eligible Medicare\nbeneficiaries can, on average, select from over 2 dozen MA and Part D plans in every county of the nation is ample\nevidence that competition is robust.”). It seems, if anything, that the MAOs would use the information to lower their\nbid amounts in an effort to become more competitive in the market, which saves both enrollees and the Government\nmoney; pushing the bid amount higher, as HHS claims “may” happen, does not follow as the only logical\nconsequences of disclosure, especially when HHS claims that MAOs exist in a competitive enrollee market where\nenrollees, on average, have a dozen MAOs to choose from in each geographic region. Def.’s Mem. 21; 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 21,518 (“. . . MA-eligible Medicare beneficiaries can, on average, select from over 2 dozen MA and Part D plans\nin every county of the nation . . . .”). If all MAOs could ascertain the bid amounts of all the other MAOs, as would\nbe the case here if the Government is correct, it seems most likely that, in CMS’s own words, “competition, if\nanything, will be enhanced by release [of the data] rather than harmed in any way.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518; see also\nid. (“[W]here plans are free to modify the actual competitive components that are used to build up bids, such as\nbenefit offerings and member cost-sharing, little is left of the argument that revealed cost trends will have an impact\non the competitive nature of the programs.”).\n\n                                                         13\n\fcomes within a FOIA exemption.” Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 169\n\nF.3d 16, 18 (D.C. Cir. 1999) [hereinafter Mohawk].\n\n         Dr. Biles also cites a line of precedent holding that impairment is highly unlikely when\n\ndisclosure of the information is compelled. 10 In Mohawk, the court noted that disclosure of\n\nrequired data containing “hard, cold numbers”—a fitting description of the actuarial cost data\n\nrequired by the Bid Pricing Tool—refutes a conclusory claim by HHS that disclosure of the\n\ninformation will impair HHS’s ability to obtain the information in the future. 169 F.3d at 18.\n\nThis line of precedent, sourced initially from National Parks, is convincing to and binding on the\n\nCourt. Even if HHS’s contentions are true, HHS has failed to meet its burden of showing how\n\ndisclosure of the information will impair CMS from obtaining the data in the future—the first\n\nprong of the National Parks test. HHS must meet its burden of production regarding the second\n\nprong of the National Parks test (substantial competitive harm) in order to survive an overall\n\nmotion for summary judgment in Dr. Biles’s favor.\n\n         B.       Substantial Competitive Harm\n\n         To prove a likelihood of substantial competitive harm, HHS must prove that (1) the\n\nsubmitters of the information “actually face competition” and that (2) “substantial competitive\n\n10\n   Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v.

In Judicial Watch, certain information was required to be submitted in order to apply for a loan\nwith the Export-Import Bank. Id. at 30.

However,\nJudicial Watch is distinguishable from the present situation, as those applying for loans are, unlike MAOs, not\nrestricted by actuarial requirements and in competition with each other for the best loan rate.

Proof of Competition\n\n           Though HHS’s assertions of competition within the bidding process 11 are contradicted,12\n\nHHS’s assertion that MAOs compete to attract enrollees is sufficient to support HHS’s burden of\n\nproduction and persuasion on this issue, as Dr. Biles admits that “low levels” of competition\n\nexist among MAOs in the marketplace, Biles Decl. ¶¶ 116–23; see also Pl.’s Mem. 29. “Actual\n\ncompetition” does not require high levels of competition, but only “actual” competition.\n\n                   ii. Proof of Substantial Competitive Harm\n\n           “In reviewing an agency’s determination as to substantial competitive harm, we\n\nrecognize that ‘predictive judgments are not capable of exact proof,’ and we generally defer to\n\nthe agency’s predictive judgments as to “‘repercussions of disclosure,’’” but conclusory\n\nstatements from the agency do not suffice. United Technologies Corp. v. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 601\n\nF.3d 557, 563 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). “Under FOIA, an agency has the burden to\n\ndemonstrate that the withheld documents are exempt from disclosure, which it may meet by\n\nsubmitting ‘affidavits [that] show, with reasonable specificity, why the documents fall within the\n\nexemption. The affidavits will not suffice if the agency’s claims are conclusory, merely reciting\n\nstatutory standards, or if they are too vague or sweeping.’” In Def. of Animals v. U.S. Dep’t of\n\nAgric., 501 F. Supp. 2d 1, 5–8 (D.D.C. 2007). The question here is whether or not HHS’s claims\n\nare too “conclusory” or “vague” to survive Dr. Biles’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n\n\n11\n     Def.’s Mem. 19.\n12\n  76 Fed.

The last three points can be\n\ndistilled into two claims: (1) the disclosure of the information will allow MAOs to make changes\n\nto their own practices (such as design, pricing, benefits, and price negotiations with providers)\n\nthat would allow them to better compete with other MAOs, and (2) providers with which MAOs\n\ncontract could use the data to manipulate the negotiation process. See Theisen Decl. ¶ 10b.\n\n\n\n\n                                                16\n\f         HHS’s assertion that disclosure will enable MAOs to change their practices to better\n\ncompete with other MAOs is nothing more than arguing that disclosure has a likelihood of\n\ncreating competition among MAOs—an assertion that does not necessarily prove that disclosure\n\nhas a likelihood of creating substantial competitive harm, which implies an “unfair” exposure of\n\none competitor to that competitor’s detriment and to a non-exposed competitor’s gain. 13\n\nHowever, the last point regarding providers’ ability to manipulate the negotiation process when\n\ncontracting with MAOs could serve as proof of a likelihood of substantial competitive harm, as\n\nthe providers may not be similarly exposed 14 and can therefore gain a commercial advantage\n\nover the MAO.\n\n         Still, HHS’s assertions of competitive harm are rebutted by Dr. Biles, without an\n\nadequate evidentiary response from HHS, when Dr. Biles claims that (a) the 2009 requested data\n\ncannot cause competitive “harm” because the disclosure of the data is “symmetrical,” meaning\n\nthat all competitors are exposed to the same degree by the disclosure; (b) much of the data is\n\nalready publicly available, which nullifies HHS’s claims that the data is “confidential”; (c) the\n\nrequested data is now stale for purposes of predicting MAOs’ future bids, as it is retrospective,\n\nhistorical data rather than projective data and cannot be “trended” in order to make predictions\n\nbecause the data is only from a single year—2009. Pl.’s Mem. 41–44.\n\n13\n  See, e.g., Nat’l Parks II, 547 F.2d at 678 n.18 (“The district court concluded that disclosure of the information by\nthe Park Service would be useful to a competitor in devising means to improve its competitive position at the\nexpense of the concessioner. Such disclosure would reveal concessioners’ business secrets . . . without providing the\nconcessioner in most instances with similar access to the books and records of his competitors. This competitive\ndisadvantage is fundamentally unfair and would be likely to cause harm to the concessioner's basic position.”)\n(emphasis added); see also Nat’l Parks, 498 F.2d 765 at 768–69; Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. Nat’l Insts.\nfor Health, 209 F. Supp. 2d 37, 48 & n.7 (D.D.C. 2002); Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Exp.-Imp. Bank, 108 F. Supp. 2d 19,\n29 (D.D.C. 2000); Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. FDA, 997 F. Supp. 56, 65 (D.D.C. 1998).\n14\n  This is rebutted by Dr. Biles’s claims that providers are similarly exposed by publicly available data. See Biles\nDecl. ¶¶ 65–84. These claims are somewhat disputed by HHS, but for different reasons unrelated to providers’\nability to negotiate contracts with MAOs. See Def.’s Reply 20–22 (arguing that the public cost data for providers,\nwhich has not commercially harmed those providers, is “entirely different” from the requested data in order to show\nthat HHS’s claims of competitive harm to MAOs are not nullified by the lack of commercial harm to providers).\n\n\n                                                         17\n\f                         a. Asymmetrical Harm\n\n        Dr. Biles argues that, when all MAOs have access to the requested data, there is no risk\n\nof substantial competitive harm to an MAO because all of the MAOs have access to data to\n\nwhich every other MAO has access—preventing any one MAO from unfairly benefiting to the\n\ndetriment of another MAO. Pl.’s Mem. 2. Dr. Biles refers to this as a lack of “asymmetric”\n\ndisclosure and claims that asymmetric disclosure is required in order to prove substantial\n\ncompetitive harm. Pl.’s Mem. at 30–33. (citing Silverberg v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs.,\n\n1991 WL 633740, *4 (D.D.C. June 14, 1991) (reasoning that because each laboratory would\n\nhave access to the same type of information as every other laboratory in the program, that no\n\nsingle laboratory would receive a competitive advantage over the other). The Court does not\n\nneed to determine whether or not asymmetric disclosure is required for substantial competitive\n\nharm. However, precedent suggests that the “harm” aspect of “competitive harm” is an unfair\n\ncommercial disadvantage by way of exposure. 15 Thus, “asymmetric” disclosure, or the lack\n\nthereof, is valid evidence that can help establish or nullify a claim of substantial competitive\n\nharm. HHS fails to explain why symmetric disclosure still poses a likelihood of substantial\n\ncompetitive harm, and, instead, only asserts that “asymmetrical competitive harm . . . has never\n\nbeen required [under Exemption 4].” Def.’s Reply 12. Pointing out what is not required to show\n\nsubstantial competitive harm is not affirmative evidence of competitive harm nor is it sufficient\n\nevidence to rebut Dr. Biles’s claim.\n\n                         b. Public Availability of Requested Data\n\n        HHS admits that some information relating to the “bid” and the plan payment is already\n\npublicly available. Rice Decl. ¶ 19, Rice Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 4–7, ECF No. 27-2. However, HHS\n\n\n15\n   See Nat’l Parks II, 547 F.2d at 678 n.18 (“This competitive disadvantage is fundamentally unfair and would be\nlikely to cause harm to the concessioner's basic position.”); see also supra note 13 and accompanying text.\n\n                                                      18\n\fasserts: “The information requested by Dr. Biles goes far beyond the information that CMS\n\nproactively discloses to the public. Release of the specific information requested by Dr. Biles\n\nwill cause substantial harm to the competitive positions of [MAOs] . . . .” Rice Decl. ¶ 16. Dr.\n\nBiles rebuts that assertion by claiming that “[a]ny difference[s] between the data that is not\n\npublic and the Worksheet 1 data are so small that they are irrelevant for analytic purposes by\n\nresearchers[] or other MA[Os] and their consultants.” Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 24. HHS does not\n\nshow—by numbers, specific examples, or any evidence beyond conclusory statements—how the\n\nportions of data requested by Dr. Biles that Dr. Biles claims can already be obtained by public\n\nmeans are materially different than the public data for purposes of competitive use. 16\n\n         Dr. Biles argues that because “a considerable amount of the data sought is already public\n\nor can be calculated based on data published by CMS,” any likelihood of substantial competitive\n\nharm must be considered in light of analogous data that is already available to MAOs. Pl.’s\n\nMem. 33. The Court agrees. But public availability of analogous data can cut both ways, as it\n\ncan nullify claims that the requested data is confidential, but it can also make the requested data\n\nmore harmful if the public data can be combined with the requested data to obtain commercial\n\ninformation that is likely to cause substantial competitive harm.\n\n         Whether or not some of the requested data is publicly available is clearly a “disputed\n\nfact” that is both material and a “genuine issue” upon which the case could turn because the\n\npublic availability of the data would nullify HHS’s Exemption Four claim: “Public availability of\n\ninformation defeats an argument that the disclosure of the information would likely cause\n\ncompetitive harm.” Nat’l Cmty.

Thus, summary judgment in favor of HHS is inappropriate.\n\n16\n  HHS claims that Dr. Biles is “incorrect” to claim that certain portions of his requested data are essentially publicly\navailable because the public data and the requested data are “not always identical” and are “different” in that the\nrequested data is “more detail[ed]” than the public data and is “proprietary.” Rice Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9–11.\n\n                                                          19\n\fHowever, summary judgment in favor of Dr. Biles is still a possibility: if HHS fails to offer\n\nenough evidence to satisfy its burden of proof regarding competitive harm, it would be irrelevant\n\nwhether or not the data is publicly available since Dr. Biles would automatically prevail.\n\n                           c. Staleness of Requested Data\n\n         Regarding FOIA, this Circuit has recognized that “stale information is of little value.”17\n\nPayne Enterprises, Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 494 (D.C. Cir. 1988). HHS has not\n\nexplained why the requested 2009 data is valuable to MAOs in light of Dr. Biles’s claims that it\n\nis too stale and aged to be used for substantial competitive purposes. Pl.’s Reply 22–23. HHS\n\nrecognized the concept of staleness in its rule-making response in 2011 where CMS, refuting\n\nMAO objections to the release of MAO payment data, argued that two-year-old payment data\n\nwas stale and unlikely to harm MAOs: “[A]lthough trends from one year to the next might be\n\nrevealed through release of payment data for sequential years, the fact remains that such trends\n\nwill be stale (at least 2 years old) and reveal little about competitive strategies in future years.”\n\n76 Fed. Reg. at 21518. At the earliest, MAOs could make use of the 2009 data in 2014. 18 Biles\n\nSupp. Decl. ¶ 91.\n\n         Dr. Biles claims that the passing of time, as well as the changes in the health care\n\nindustry, which include rising costs, health care reform under the Patient Protection and\n17\n   See also JCI Metal Prods. v. U.S. Dep’t of the Navy, 2010 WL 2925436, *7 (S.D. Cal. July 23, 2010) (“any\nresulting competitive harm to JCI from the release of this ‘stale’ information would be minimal.”); N.Y. Times Co. v.\nU.S. Dep’t of Labor, 340 F. Supp. 2d 394, 402 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (disclosure of information used to maintain a\ncompetitive advantage would not cause competitive injury if released four years later because the information is\noutdated); Braintree Elec. Light Dep’t v. Dep’t of Energy, 494 F. Supp. 287, 291 (D.D.C. 1980) (“One of the key\nissues in any exemption 4 case is the current significance of the commercial data”); Boeing Co. v. Dep’t of Air\nForce, 616 F. Supp. 2d 40, 49 (D.D.C. 2009) (concluding that while the agency could properly withhold information\nabout future rates, it had to disclose information about past rates). But cf. Wash. Psychiatric Soc. v. U.S. Office of\nPers. Mgmt, 1988 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17609 (D.D.C. Oct. 12, 1988) (holding that documents submitted by insurance\ncompanies containing detailed compilations of benefit costs and user statistics could be used by competitors to\nredesign their benefit packages to seek a competitive advantage, even years after the data was submitted).\n18\n  Dr. Biles points out that “[c]ontracts with providers, benefits, and other internal MAO policies must be set well in\nadvance of a calendar year, as these policies must be in place when Medicare beneficiaries select an MA plan for the\nCalendar Year 2013 during the ‘open enrollment season’ that begins October 15, 2012.” Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 91.\n\n\n                                                         20\n\fAffordable Care Act, 19 changes in the way rebates are calculated, etc. 20—make the 2009 data too\n\nstale to rise to the level of “substantial” commercial harm, if it rises to the level of any type of\n\nharm at all.       Pl.’s Reply 43.      HHS responds with the puny reply that Dr. Biles has “not\n\nconnect[ed] changes in the health care system to the alleged staleness of the data” 21 and that\n\n“‘[i]nformation does not become stale merely because it is old’”—citing a completely\n\ndistinguishable case where this district held that old and no longer used air bag technology\n\ninformation was not stale because it would reveal to a competitor a “comprehensive picture of\n\nthe progression of air bag technology over almost a decade,” which would give a competitor “an\n\nedge in improving their own technology by not having to invest as much time and money in\n\nresearch and development.” Def.’s Reply 17–18 (citing Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l Highway\n\nTraffic Safety Admin., 93 F. Supp. 2d 1 (D.D.C. 2000)). Neither claim by HHS is sufficient to\n\nrebut Dr. Biles’s claim that the data is too stale to cause a likelihood of commercial harm.\n\n           HHS also contends that “competitors could ascertain (or at least closely estimate) the\n\namounts and component pieces of a given [MAO]’s recent bid,” Rice Decl. ¶ 17 (emphasis\n\nadded), and could use that knowledge to “undermine [an MAO’s] position in the marketplace”\n\n“if” that competitor could access an MAO’s bid information for all of its plans “over a several\n\nyear period.” Rice Decl. ¶ 22 (emphasis added). Dr. Biles notes that, because he has only\n\n\n19\n     26 U.S.C. § 5000A (2012).\n20\n  Dr. Biles lists the following relevant changes in the health care market since 2009: (1) The Affordable Care Act\nreduced MA payments that must continue to be reduced until the MA payments reach an average of 101% of costs\nin traditional Medicare in 2017 (down from an average of 114%), Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 93; (2) The Affordable Care\nAct also changed payment policies that revise the calculation of MA payments based on counties, phasing in a new\nnational policy based on placing all counties into one of four payment groups that benefits MAOs in areas with very\nhigh traditional Medicare costs and disadvantages MAOs in areas with low traditional Medicare costs, Id. ¶ 94, (3)\nCMS announced new bonus payments that will be awarded to MAOs based on the performance of the health care\nproviders than an MAO contracts with, Id. ¶ 96.\n21\n   This claim is not only puny, but also inaccurate. Dr. Biles clearly explains that the 2009 requested data would be\nstale in light of “major provisions” to the MA program, including a reduction in payments to MAOs, a new formula\nfor MA plan payment benchmarks, a new formula for calculating the “rebate” to MA plans, and a new quality rating\nsystem that was initiated in 2012 that affects MAO payments. Biles Decl. ¶¶ 124, 127–31.\n\n                                                        21\n\frequested historical cost data from 2009—a single year—and has not requested any projection\n\ndata, the requested data cannot be trended. Pl.’s Reply 13–14; 23; Def.’s Mem. Ex. 1. Further,\n\nDr. Biles claims that, because the 2009 data is now stale in the rapidly changing and non-linear\n\nhealthcare market, MAOs cannot use the data effectively to predict an MAO’s recent or future\n\nbid. Pl.’s Mem. 2. HHS’s only rebuttal to these claims is an assertion that if Exemption Four\n\ndoes not protect this 2009 data, Exemption Four would not protect data from subsequent years,\n\nwhich would eventually have to be released and would then give researchers and other MAOs\n\nthe ability to trend the data. Def.’s Reply 19 n.5. HHS’s conclusion does not follow, as the\n\nrequest for the release of more recent data, as well as data over multiple years that could be\n\ntrended, creates a distinguishable factual situation that requires a new analysis and new evidence\n\nof substantial competitive harm. 22 Speculative assertions do not serve as affirmative evidence.\n\n         HHS has failed to explain why the 2009 data is still commercially valuable to competitors\n\nor how that data could be used in 2014 or later to create a likelihood of substantial competitive\n\nharm, thereby failing to meet its burden of proof in light of Dr. Biles’s nullifying evidence.\n\n                           d. HHS’s Specific Claims Regarding the Requested Data\n\n         When there are various categories of data, the agency has the burden of establishing why\n\nor how each category of data is likely to cause substantial competitive harm. See S. Alliance for\n\nClean Energy v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 2012 WL 1021487, *10–11 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, 2102);\n\nGov’t Accountability Project, 691 F. Supp. 2d at 179. HHS does not explain how disclosure of\n\nWorksheet 1, Section II, Lines 1 (“Paid Through”), 4 (“Completion Factor”), 5 (“Plans in Base’),\n\nor 6 (“Describe the source of the base period experience data”) could cause competitive harm.\n\n22\n  The Court’s present holding applies only to the requested data from the single year (2009) from which it is\nrequested. Even if the exact same data were subsequently requested for, say, 2010 (a single year), the present\nholding does not act as a green light for disclosure. As the Court expresses above, requests for additional years of\ndata (even if requested in increments of single years) that would enable the presently requested data to be trended is\na distinguishable set of facts that requires an entirely separate and new analysis.\n\n                                                         22\n\f       HHS objects to disclosure of Section II, Line 2 (“Member Months”) because release of\n\nthat information would provide “insight into enrollment stability and market share.” Rice Decl. ¶\n\n18; see also Marquis Decl. ¶ 24. Dr. Biles contends that enrollment data is already publicly\n\navailable, Pl.’s Mem. 38 (citing Rice Decl. ¶ 14 (stating that each month since August 2006,\n\nCMS has posted on its website the number of enrollees in each MA plan.)), but the public data’s\n\ndetail, as compared to the requested data’s detail, is disputed by HHS. Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.\n\nStill, regardless of whether or not the data is publicly available, HHS fails to show how “insight\n\ninto enrollment stability and market share” will likely cause substantial competitive harm to an\n\nMAO, thereby failing to meet its burden of proof for this claim.\n\n       In addition to HHS/CMS employees, several MAO officials provided declarations in\n\nsupport of HHS. The MAO officials’ main objections regarded the release of Section II “risk\n\nscores,” Section III “cost structure” and “utilization patterns,” and Section VI “expenses” and\n\n“profit/loss by plan.” Theisen Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9–11; Yui Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n       HHS contends that the disclosure of risk scores would “enable . . . competitors to devise\n\nstrategies aimed at unfairly attracting beneficiaries with higher or lower [health] scores,” which\n\nwould “disrupt [an MAO’s] risk pool” and “violate CMS’s requirement that plans ‘not design\n\nbenefit packages that discourage enrollment or encourage disenrollment of severely or\n\nchronically ill beneficiaries.’” Theisen Decl. ¶¶ 5a, 10a. However, HHS does not explain how a\n\ncompetitor would use the 2009 data to “devise strategies” or what those “strategies” would be\n\nand has not offered any evidence that affirms that an MAO would actually engage in the claimed\n\nactivity that apparently violates a CMS requirement. It is difficult to understand how MAOs\n\ncould successfully violate a “requirement” of CMS for very long without repercussions, and it is\n\nequally unclear why it would be “unfair[]” for competitors to try and attract beneficiaries with\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fbetter or worse health when all MAOs would have equal access to the risk data and could\n\ntherefore all try to do the same thing. Further, “attracting beneficiaries” by way of “strategies”\n\nseems highly speculative when beneficiaries choose to enroll in a specific plan with a specific\n\nMAO based on various personal factors. See Biles Decl. ¶¶ 28–32, 135. Additionally, Dr. Biles\n\nclaims that risk scores, to the extent they would be used by competitors, are already publicly\n\navailable. Pl.’s Reply 14, 18–19 (citing Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 10). HHS asserts that the public risk\n\nscores are “not always identical” to the risk scores in Worksheet 1, but fails to explain why the\n\ndifference between the scores is commercially significant. 23 HHS’s vague, speculative claims\n\nand conclusory rebuttals to Dr. Biles’s counter evidence do not satisfy its evidentiary burden.\n\n         MAO officials claim that “cost structure” and “utilization patterns” data in Section III\n\nwould allow competitors or providers to use the information to “undercut [an MAO] in price\n\nnegotiations” when contracting. Yui Dec. ¶ 14; Theisen Decl ¶¶ 5b, 10b–c, 11. Dr. Biles claims\n\nthat the symmetric disclosure of the data, Pl.’s Reply 9–13, the stale nature of the 2009 data,\n\nBiles Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 91–96; Biles Decl. ¶ 124–27, the existing public and industry knowledge of\n\ncost and utilization information, Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 63, the inability to trend the requested data,\n\nPl.’s Reply 15–16, and the “high level of aggregation” of the Section III data 24 prevents a\n\n\n23\n   HHS notes that the non-ESRD risk score requested by Dr. Biles is “not always identical to the risk score that CMS\nmakes public.” Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 8. The actual risk score for each MAO is retroactively calculated and is publicly\navailable, while the projected risk score (the risk score Dr. Biles is requesting) is the risk score upon which the bid is\nbased is not publicly available. Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 25. Though HHS asserts that the actual risk score and the\nprojected risk score could differ, Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 8, Dr. Biles notes that HHS does not offer any data\nsubstantiating the implied assertion of actual difference between projected and actual risk scores and explains that,\nsince MAOs have until June of the submission year to submit actuarially-certified risk score data, the projected risk\nscore should be quite close to the actual risk score. Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 26. “Actuaries preparing Worksheet 1 for an\nMAO would, in light of past experience with the MAO’s enrollee pool, have a good understanding of the health\nstatus of the MAO’s enrollees” (which is the essence of the risk score). Id. Since MAO actuaries have access to\nactual risk scores for past years for all MAO plans and since the future projected risk scores are logically similar to\npast plan risk scores, any difference between the projected and actual risk scores should be so minimal as to make\nany difference irrelevant for purposes of research or competitors. Id.\n24\n  Dr. Biles explains that costs per member per month data is a combination of three factors and that the Section III\ndata “masks the relationship among [the three factors] for any individual plan, making it impossible to discern the\nextent to which a particular factor is responsible for cost.” Biles Decl. ¶ 113. “These numbers are at a high level of\n\n                                                           24\n\fcompetitor or a provider from effectively using the requested data to manipulate contract\n\nnegotiations, Biles Decl. ¶ 113. HHS fails to explain how a competing MAO or provider would\n\nuse the requested 2009 data to “undercut” an MAO in contract negotiations and does not provide\n\nsufficient evidence to rebut Dr. Biles’s contradicting and possibly nullifying claims.\n\n         Finally, HHS asserts that Section VI cost data would “provide information about the\n\nefficiency of operations and the financial position of the organization.” Rice Decl ¶ 20. Here,\n\nHHS’s claims are again too conclusory to satisfy their burden of proof. “Efficiency” and\n\n“financial position” are highly generalized terms that do not, in themselves, prove competitive\n\nharm; stating that disclosure of cost information would reveal “financial position” could describe\n\nany sort of disclosure of MAO information, including the disclosure of payment and enrollment\n\ninformation that CMS has already made public. MAO officials, on behalf of HHS, claim that the\n\n“expenses” and “profit/loss by plan” data in Section VI would “allow competitors and network\n\nproviders to build business strategies to unfairly target [an MAO’s] specific cost structure.”\n\nTheisen Decl. ¶ 5c. These claims are rebutted by Dr. Biles’s assertions of staleness, symmetric\n\ndisclosure, and public availability of the requested data. Biles Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 85–96; Pl.’s Reply\n\n9–13. But regardless of Dr. Biles’s contradicting evidence, an assertion that a competitor or\n\nprovider would “build business strategies to unfairly target [an MAO’s] specific cost structure,”\n\nwithout further explaining how the disclosure of the requested data would facilitate that activity,\n\nis exactly the sort of vague claim that is unacceptable as evidence of commercial harm.\n\n                           e. HHS’s Burden\n\n         HHS contends that releasing the requested data would “cause harm” by providing\n\n“proprietary plan information” that is not publicly available, which would result in “insight” into\n\naggregation so that a competing [MAO] could not learn anything about another [MAO’s] internal contracting\npolicies with hospitals or physicians or how their strategy for managing utilization of high costs procedures . . . is\ndesigned.” Id.\n\n                                                         25\n\fvarious aspects of an MAO’s operations like “market strategy” and “financial details.” Rice\n\nDecl. ¶ 18.    HHS asserts that disclosure of the information would be “inappropriate” and\n\n“unfair.” Rice Decl. ¶¶ 21–22; Marquis Decl, ¶ 26. Crucial, and missing, in HHS’s evidence is\n\nexactly how all of these consequences of disclosure would cause a likelihood of substantial\n\ncompetitive harm to MAOs. See Gov’t Accountability Project, 691 F. Supp. 2d at 175–76, 178–\n\n79 (agency failed to show “how” competitor would use data to its advantage or to competitor’s\n\ndisadvantage ). HHS does not even give examples of the extent of the harm or the type of harm\n\nthat would occur if the requested data were released. HHS has the burden of showing that\n\nsubstantial competitive harm is likely. HHS has failed to provide a single non-conclusory claim\n\nthat asserts anything beyond a possibility of competition and has failed to rebut Dr. Biles’s\n\nnullifying evidence with affirmative, non-conclusory counter evidence.           “Conclusory and\n\ngeneralized allegations of substantial competitive harm, of course, are unacceptable and cannot\n\nsupport an agency’s decision to withhold requested documents.” Pub. Citizen Health Research\n\nGrp. v. FDA, 704 F.2d 1280, 1291 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Assuming that HHS’s claims are true, HHS\n\nhas failed to meet its burden of proving that disclosure of the requested information will likely\n\ncause substantial competitive harm.       Thus, summary judgment in favor of Dr. Biles is\n\nappropriate.\n\nIV.    ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS\n\n       Dr. Biles has moved for attorneys’ fees and costs. Pl.’s Compl. 5 ¶ 5 (Relief). Though\n\nDr. Biles has prevailed and though FOIA gives this Court authority to award attorneys’ fees to\n\nDr. Biles, 5 U.S.C. § (a)(4)(E)(i) (2012), the Court will not address that request here. Pursuant to\n\nthe local rules, the Court shall “enter an order directing the parties to confer and to attempt to\n\nreach agreement on fee issues” and shall set a status conference at which the Court will (1)\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fdetermine whether settlement of any and or all aspects of the fee matter has been reached, (2)\n\nenter judgment for any fee on which agreement has been reached, (3) make the determination\n\nregarding pending appeals required by paragraph (b) of LCvR 54.2, and (4) set an appropriate\n\nschedule for completion of the fee litigation.\n\nV.     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be DENIED\n\nand plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to\n\ndisclose to plaintiff, in the form requested by plaintiff, all information requested in plaintiff’s\n\nJuly 18, 2011, FOIA request submitted to CMS.\n\n       A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue this date.\n\n       Signed by Royce C.

BACKGROUND\n\n       On July 18, 2011, plaintiff Dr. Biles—a professor at The George Washington University\n\nSchool of Public Health and Health Services who studies the Medicare Advantage (“MA”)\n\nprogram—filed a FOIA request with defendant HHS’s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\n\nServices (“CMS”), which oversees the Medicare Advantage (“MA”) program. Pl.’s Mem. in\n\nOpp’n to Def.’s M. Summ. J. & in Supp. of Pl.’s M. Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mem.”) 2, ECF No. 24-1;\n\nBiles Decl. ¶ 1, Exh. A (CV), ECF No. 24-2; Def.’s Mem. in Supp. of Def.’s M. Summ. J.\n\n(“Def.’s Mem.”) 4, ECF No. 20. In order to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of the MA\n\nand Medicare programs, Dr. Biles requested “specific data and other information for 2009\n\nprovided to CMS, in or about June 2010, by all Medicare Part C Medicare Advantage\n\nOrganizations on WORKSHEET 1—MA BASE PERIOD EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTION\n\nASSUMPTIONS.” Pl.’s Complaint ¶ 1; Def.’s Mem. 4; Biles Decl. Ex. F, at 1 (FOIA Request).\n\n       Medicare Advantage organizations (“MAOs”) are private insurance companies that offer\n\nhealth insurance coverage to Medicare beneficiaries and are required, pursuant to 42 C.F.R. §\n\n422.254, to submit a Bid Pricing Tool to CMS by the first Monday of June each year. Rice Decl.\n\n¶¶ 5, 7–9, ECF No. 20-1; Pl.’s Mem. 2. The Bid Pricing Tool is an Excel workbook comprised\n\nof seven worksheets of data that determine the projected costs and revenue for an MAO to\n\nprovide coverage to MA beneficiaries in the next calendar year. Def.’s Mem. 4; Pl.’s Mem. 1–3;\n\nRice Decl. ¶¶ 5–7, 12.    The “bid” submitted by MAOs is not like a traditional bid in a\n\ncompetitive arena where one winner takes all, as in bids for government contracts. Pl.’s Mem. 7.\n\nCMS explains:\n\n       [T]he MA . . . program[] [is] not competitive in the way that term is normally\n       understood. Although [MAOs] do compete for members, primarily through the\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f        benefits offered and the cost (member cost sharing and premium) of those\n        benefits, they do not directly compete for the payments that CMS makes. 1\n\nCMS “approve[s] all sustainable bids that are otherwise qualified without preference for the\n\nlowest bidder.” 2 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518.\n\n        Further unlike a competitive bid for a contract where the bidder can choose his desired\n\nbid amount, an MAO’s “bid” is based on the MAO’s actual costs expended by the MAO in the\n\nprevious year to provide its offered Medicare benefits; this data is called the MAO’s “base\n\nperiod” data and is the category from which Dr. Biles has requested specific data. Pl.’s Mem. 7;\n\nsee Rice Decl. ¶ 6. Base period data must be verified by an actuary. Pl.’s Mem. 15, 42; Rice\n\nDecl. ¶ 12; 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518 (statement by CMS/HHS) (“Utilization, costs, and trends must\n\nbe certified by a qualified, independent actuary prior to bid submission.”); 42 C.F.R. §\n\n422.254(b)(5) (2012).\n\n        Ultimately, the “bid” data is trended forward to the next year by a series of formulae, like\n\ninflation and other factors, embedded in the seven Excel worksheets of the Bid Pricing Tool.\n\nPl.’s Mem. 7; see Rice Decl. ¶ 6; 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,517. The formulae calculate the bid data to\n\ndetermine the expected revenue needed to cover the MAO’s projected Medicare costs for the\n\nnext year. Pl.’s Mem. 7; Rice Decl. ¶ 6; 42 C.F.R. § 422.245(a)(1) (2012). This “payment plan”\n\nis the basis for CMS’s payments to an MAO, and CMS pays MAOs one year in advance to cover\n\nits portion of the MAOs’ projected cost and revenue requirements for the next year. See id; Rice\n\n1\n  Medicare Program; Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs for\nContract Year 2012 and Other Changes, 76 Fed.

For example, an MAO’s 2011\n\npayment plan is based on 2009 actuarial data. See Pl.’s Mem. 7; Rice Decl. ¶ 12.\n\n        Additionally, while the payment plan is determined according to the MAO’s estimated\n\ninternal costs, the payment amount is limited by a federally-set benchmark, which is the\n\nmaximum amount CMS will pay an MAO in a given locality.                             See 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-\n\n23(b)(1)(B) (2012); 42 C.F.R. § 422.258 (2012). The benchmarks are publicly announced by the\n\nfirst Monday in April of the year prior to the bid submissions to which the benchmarks will\n\napply. 42 U.S.C. § 1395w-23(b)(1)(B).\n\n        Dr. Biles requested “retroactive,” “historical” cost and utilization data from Sections I, II,\n\nIII, and VI of Worksheet One 3 of the Bid Pricing Tool and claims to have not requested any data\n\nthat “disclose[s] MAO assumptions, predictions, projections, or expectations for how th[o]se\n\ncosts may change in the future.” Pl.’s Mem. 8; Def.’s Mot.

Biles Decl. ¶ 97–107.\n\n           Section III is retrospective 2009 cost and utilization data for various types of health\n\nservices the MAO covers in its offered plans. Biles Decl. ¶ 108. Section III includes the rates\n\nthat each service was utilized during 2009 and automatically populates the average cost per\n\nutilization. Biles Decl. ¶¶ 111–12. Section III also provides the costs per member per month\n\n(“PMPM”) by service category for the base period; the total PMPM costs for a type of health\n\nservice are the result of three factors—the price paid for services, the quantity of services used,\n\nand the intensity of services (the extent that highly expensive new technology was used). Biles\n\nDecl. ¶¶ 112–13.\n\n           Section VI reflects the MAO’s revenue for the calendar year as well as non-benefit\n\nexpenses, like internal operating costs, that were required to provide the services described in\n\nSection III for the 2009 calendar year.

Biles Decl. ¶ 99.\n7\n  This is a projected risk score upon which the 2010 payment plan was based. Biles Decl. ¶¶ 103–05. A risk score\nis essentially the health of the MAO’s enrollee population and is used to adjust CMS’s payment to an MAO based\non their beneficiaries’ health. Id. A “Non ESRD” risk score means the risk score of the MAO’s enrollees that does\nnot includes ESRD (“End Stage Renal Disease”) enrollees. However, ESRD Medicare beneficiaries are generally\nprohibited by CMS from joining MAO plans, and ESRD patients comprise only 0.9 % of all Medicare beneficiaries.\nBiles Supp. Decl., ¶¶ 38–39, ECF No. 30-1. Thus, the Non ESRD Risk Score appears to be, for all practical\npurposes, the projected risk score of an MAO upon which the MAO’s payment plan is based.

Summary Judgment\n\n       “The court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that (1) there is no\n\ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.” Fed.

The mere existence of any factual dispute will not defeat summary judgment; the\n\nrequirement is that there be no genuine dispute about a material fact. Anderson, 477 U.S. 247–\n\n48. A fact is material if, under the applicable law, it could affect the outcome of the case. Id. A\n\ndispute is genuine if the “evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the\n\nnonmoving party.” Id. In order for the dispute to be genuine, a nonmoving party must present\n\nenough specific facts, beyond mere allegations or conclusory statements, that would enable a\n\nreasonable jury to find in favor of the nonmoving party.

Because the court cannot try issues of fact when\n\ndetermining summary judgment but can only determine whether there are issues to be tried, the\n\nnonmoving party’s evidence is to be believed and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in the\n\nnonmoving party’s favor.

R. Civ. P. 56(a), and therefore must find that there is no\n\ngenuine issue for trial. There is no genuine issue for trial unless the nonmoving party provides\n\nsufficient favorable evidence to enable a jury to return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\n\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 250–51 (explaining that the summary judgment inquiry is whether “there\n\nare any genuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fmay reasonably be resolved in favor of either party,” agreeing that the standard for summary\n\njudgment mirrors the standard for a directed verdict under Fed.

In\n\nthe present case, because the requested data is required by law to be submitted to CMS by all\n\nparticipating MAOs, 42 C.F.R. § 422.254 (2012), the National Parks test for “required\n\ninformation” applies. Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878–80.\n\n       Under National Parks, information is confidential if its disclosure is likely to (1) “impair\n\nthe Government’s ability to obtain necessary information in the future” or (2) “cause substantial\n\nharm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained.” Nat’l\n\nParks, 498 F.2d at 770; see Critical Mass, 975 F.2d at 878. Here, HHS contends that both\n\nprongs of the test are satisfied as a matter of law (though HHS need only prove one of the prongs\n\nto prevail) and that there are no genuine issues of material fact, thus requesting summary\n\njudgment in its favor. Def.’s Mem. 1, 14–21. Dr. Biles contends that HHS has not met its\n\nburden of proving with affirmative, non-conclusory evidence that Exemption Four applies in this\n\ncase and therefore requests summary judgment in his favor. Pl.’s Mem. 28.\n\n       A.     Impairment to Government’s Ability to Obtain Information in the Future\n\n       Because all MAOs are required by statute to submit the requested data to CMS in order to\n\nparticipate as an MAO the following year, the Government will continue to be able to obtain the\n\ndata required by the mandatory Bid Pricing Tool submission even if the requested data is\n\ndisclosed. Private companies participate as MAOs because it is profitable to them, and neither\n\n\n\n                                               11\n\fan MAO official nor HHS has suggested that an MAO would refuse to participate in the MA\n\nprogram if the requested data were released. See Pl.’s Mem. 21–22; Biles Decl. ¶ 33; Rice Decl.\n\n¶¶ 9–10.

HHS claims that the disclosure of the\n\nrequested information will cause MAOs to adjust their bids in order to compete with other\n\nMAOs’ bids or to keep other MAOs from “decipher[ing] their bids,” which would deprive CMS\n\nof the detailed and reliable information it now obtains. Def.’s Mem. 18–20; Rice Decl. ¶¶ 24–\n\n25. Dr. Biles disputes these claims, noting that “[i]f an MAO wishes to participate, but fails to\n\nprovide the voluminous and detailed information required on the Bid Pricing Tool [and abide by\n\nthe actuarial requirements], CMS is empowered not only to decline to renew their contract, but\n\nalso to impose sanctions.” Pl.’s Mem. 22 (citing 42 CFR § 422.254(a)(3)).\n\n        HHS fails to explain (1) how bids could be manipulated by MAOs by using the requested\n\ndata when the Bid Pricing Tool requires actuary-verified data and other strict structural\n\nrequirements that cannot be modified without serious consequences 8 and (2), even if MAOs were\n\nable to adjust their bids in some material way, how those adjustments would impair CMS’s\n\nability to obtain the information required by 42 C.F.R. § 422.254 in the future—as mere changes\n\nin the bid amounts do not necessarily equate to inaccurate data or CMS’s inability to obtain the\n\n\n\n\n8\n  For example, CMS can impose sanctions or choose not to renew a contract, 42 C.F.R. § 422.254(a)(3), or, worse,\nthe MAO could be subject to penalties for misrepresentation in contracting with the government under the False\nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729–30 (2012).

But in a 2010 response to MAOs that were\n\nclaiming the exact same thing (that the release of certain payment data would undermine the\n\nintegrity of the bidding process), CMS claimed that there was no risk of loss to the integrity of\n\nthe bidding process, not because of the type of data that was being released, but because the\n\nbidding process consisted of actuary-verified data: “Utilization, costs, and trends must be\n\ncertified by a qualified, independent actuary prior to bid submission. Since we will continue to\n\nrequire actuarial certification, integrity is unaffected.” 75 Fed. Reg. 21,432, 21,518. HHS fails\n\nto dispute Dr. Biles’s claim that “plans cannot simply raise bids strategically [or] willy-nilly\n\n[because] [t]here must be an actuarial basis for doing so.” Pl.’s Mem. 54. HHS offers “nothing\n\nbut speculative opinion that [MAOs] may not be forthcoming in the data they submit if [HHS]\n\nallows disclosure . . ., [though] the agency has the burden of showing that requested information\n\n\n\n9\n  Further, CMS does not explain how changes in the MAOs’ bid amounts would pose a threat to the MA program\nwhen CMS has a benchmark amount over which CMS will not pay an MAO and when MAOs have strong\nincentives to remain competitive (and thus, keep their costs down and their enrollee benefits up in order to attract\nenrollees).

Reg. at 21,518 (“The fact that MA-eligible Medicare\nbeneficiaries can, on average, select from over 2 dozen MA and Part D plans in every county of the nation is ample\nevidence that competition is robust.”). It seems, if anything, that the MAOs would use the information to lower their\nbid amounts in an effort to become more competitive in the market, which saves both enrollees and the Government\nmoney; pushing the bid amount higher, as HHS claims “may” happen, does not follow as the only logical\nconsequences of disclosure, especially when HHS claims that MAOs exist in a competitive enrollee market where\nenrollees, on average, have a dozen MAOs to choose from in each geographic region. Def.’s Mem. 21; 76 Fed. Reg.\nat 21,518 (“. . . MA-eligible Medicare beneficiaries can, on average, select from over 2 dozen MA and Part D plans\nin every county of the nation . . . .”). If all MAOs could ascertain the bid amounts of all the other MAOs, as would\nbe the case here if the Government is correct, it seems most likely that, in CMS’s own words, “competition, if\nanything, will be enhanced by release [of the data] rather than harmed in any way.” 76 Fed. Reg. at 21,518; see also\nid.

The last three points can be\n\ndistilled into two claims: (1) the disclosure of the information will allow MAOs to make changes\n\nto their own practices (such as design, pricing, benefits, and price negotiations with providers)\n\nthat would allow them to better compete with other MAOs, and (2) providers with which MAOs\n\ncontract could use the data to manipulate the negotiation process.

See Def.’s Reply 20–22 (arguing that the public cost data for providers,\nwhich has not commercially harmed those providers, is “entirely different” from the requested data in order to show\nthat HHS’s claims of competitive harm to MAOs are not nullified by the lack of commercial harm to providers).\n\n\n                                                         17\n\f                         a.

Pl.’s Mem. 2. Dr. Biles refers to this as a lack of “asymmetric”\n\ndisclosure and claims that asymmetric disclosure is required in order to prove substantial\n\ncompetitive harm.

The Court does not\n\nneed to determine whether or not asymmetric disclosure is required for substantial competitive\n\nharm. However, precedent suggests that the “harm” aspect of “competitive harm” is an unfair\n\ncommercial disadvantage by way of exposure. 15 Thus, “asymmetric” disclosure, or the lack\n\nthereof, is valid evidence that can help establish or nullify a claim of substantial competitive\n\nharm. HHS fails to explain why symmetric disclosure still poses a likelihood of substantial\n\ncompetitive harm, and, instead, only asserts that “asymmetrical competitive harm . . . has never\n\nbeen required [under Exemption 4].” Def.’s Reply 12. Pointing out what is not required to show\n\nsubstantial competitive harm is not affirmative evidence of competitive harm nor is it sufficient\n\nevidence to rebut Dr. Biles’s claim.\n\n                         b.

However, HHS\n\n\n15\n   See Nat’l Parks II, 547 F.2d at 678 n.18 (“This competitive disadvantage is fundamentally unfair and would be\nlikely to cause harm to the concessioner's basic position.”); see also supra note 13 and accompanying text.\n\n                                                      18\n\fasserts: “The information requested by Dr. Biles goes far beyond the information that CMS\n\nproactively discloses to the public. Release of the specific information requested by Dr. Biles\n\nwill cause substantial harm to the competitive positions of [MAOs] . . . .” Rice Decl. ¶ 16. Dr.\n\nBiles rebuts that assertion by claiming that “[a]ny difference[s] between the data that is not\n\npublic and the Worksheet 1 data are so small that they are irrelevant for analytic purposes by\n\nresearchers[] or other MA[Os] and their consultants.” Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 24. HHS does not\n\nshow—by numbers, specific examples, or any evidence beyond conclusory statements—how the\n\nportions of data requested by Dr. Biles that Dr. Biles claims can already be obtained by public\n\nmeans are materially different than the public data for purposes of competitive use. 16\n\n         Dr. Biles argues that because “a considerable amount of the data sought is already public\n\nor can be calculated based on data published by CMS,” any likelihood of substantial competitive\n\nharm must be considered in light of analogous data that is already available to MAOs. Pl.’s\n\nMem. 33. The Court agrees. But public availability of analogous data can cut both ways, as it\n\ncan nullify claims that the requested data is confidential, but it can also make the requested data\n\nmore harmful if the public data can be combined with the requested data to obtain commercial\n\ninformation that is likely to cause substantial competitive harm.\n\n         Whether or not some of the requested data is publicly available is clearly a “disputed\n\nfact” that is both material and a “genuine issue” upon which the case could turn because the\n\npublic availability of the data would nullify HHS’s Exemption Four claim: “Public availability of\n\ninformation defeats an argument that the disclosure of the information would likely cause\n\ncompetitive harm.” Nat’l Cmty.

Thus, summary judgment in favor of HHS is inappropriate.\n\n16\n  HHS claims that Dr. Biles is “incorrect” to claim that certain portions of his requested data are essentially publicly\navailable because the public data and the requested data are “not always identical” and are “different” in that the\nrequested data is “more detail[ed]” than the public data and is “proprietary.” Rice Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9–11.\n\n                                                          19\n\fHowever, summary judgment in favor of Dr. Biles is still a possibility: if HHS fails to offer\n\nenough evidence to satisfy its burden of proof regarding competitive harm, it would be irrelevant\n\nwhether or not the data is publicly available since Dr. Biles would automatically prevail.\n\n                           c.

HHS\n\nrecognized the concept of staleness in its rule-making response in 2011 where CMS, refuting\n\nMAO objections to the release of MAO payment data, argued that two-year-old payment data\n\nwas stale and unlikely to harm MAOs: “[A]lthough trends from one year to the next might be\n\nrevealed through release of payment data for sequential years, the fact remains that such trends\n\nwill be stale (at least 2 years old) and reveal little about competitive strategies in future years.”\n\n76 Fed.

Neither claim by HHS is sufficient to\n\nrebut Dr. Biles’s claim that the data is too stale to cause a likelihood of commercial harm.\n\n           HHS also contends that “competitors could ascertain (or at least closely estimate) the\n\namounts and component pieces of a given [MAO]’s recent bid,” Rice Decl. ¶ 17 (emphasis\n\nadded), and could use that knowledge to “undermine [an MAO’s] position in the marketplace”\n\n“if” that competitor could access an MAO’s bid information for all of its plans “over a several\n\nyear period.” Rice Decl. ¶ 22 (emphasis added). Dr. Biles notes that, because he has only\n\n\n19\n     26 U.S.C. § 5000A (2012).\n20\n  Dr. Biles lists the following relevant changes in the health care market since 2009: (1) The Affordable Care Act\nreduced MA payments that must continue to be reduced until the MA payments reach an average of 101% of costs\nin traditional Medicare in 2017 (down from an average of 114%), Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 93; (2) The Affordable Care\nAct also changed payment policies that revise the calculation of MA payments based on counties, phasing in a new\nnational policy based on placing all counties into one of four payment groups that benefits MAOs in areas with very\nhigh traditional Medicare costs and disadvantages MAOs in areas with low traditional Medicare costs, Id. ¶ 94, (3)\nCMS announced new bonus payments that will be awarded to MAOs based on the performance of the health care\nproviders than an MAO contracts with, Id. ¶ 96.\n21\n   This claim is not only puny, but also inaccurate. Dr. Biles clearly explains that the 2009 requested data would be\nstale in light of “major provisions” to the MA program, including a reduction in payments to MAOs, a new formula\nfor MA plan payment benchmarks, a new formula for calculating the “rebate” to MA plans, and a new quality rating\nsystem that was initiated in 2012 that affects MAO payments. Biles Decl. ¶¶ 124, 127–31.\n\n                                                        21\n\frequested historical cost data from 2009—a single year—and has not requested any projection\n\ndata, the requested data cannot be trended. Pl.’s Reply 13–14; 23; Def.’s Mem. Ex. 1. Further,\n\nDr. Biles claims that, because the 2009 data is now stale in the rapidly changing and non-linear\n\nhealthcare market, MAOs cannot use the data effectively to predict an MAO’s recent or future\n\nbid. Pl.’s Mem. 2. HHS’s only rebuttal to these claims is an assertion that if Exemption Four\n\ndoes not protect this 2009 data, Exemption Four would not protect data from subsequent years,\n\nwhich would eventually have to be released and would then give researchers and other MAOs\n\nthe ability to trend the data. Def.’s Reply 19 n.5. HHS’s conclusion does not follow, as the\n\nrequest for the release of more recent data, as well as data over multiple years that could be\n\ntrended, creates a distinguishable factual situation that requires a new analysis and new evidence\n\nof substantial competitive harm. 22 Speculative assertions do not serve as affirmative evidence.\n\n         HHS has failed to explain why the 2009 data is still commercially valuable to competitors\n\nor how that data could be used in 2014 or later to create a likelihood of substantial competitive\n\nharm, thereby failing to meet its burden of proof in light of Dr. Biles’s nullifying evidence.\n\n                           d. HHS’s Specific Claims Regarding the Requested Data\n\n         When there are various categories of data, the agency has the burden of establishing why\n\nor how each category of data is likely to cause substantial competitive harm.

Mar. 28, 2102);\n\nGov’t Accountability Project, 691 F. Supp. 2d at 179. HHS does not explain how disclosure of\n\nWorksheet 1, Section II, Lines 1 (“Paid Through”), 4 (“Completion Factor”), 5 (“Plans in Base’),\n\nor 6 (“Describe the source of the base period experience data”) could cause competitive harm.\n\n22\n  The Court’s present holding applies only to the requested data from the single year (2009) from which it is\nrequested. Even if the exact same data were subsequently requested for, say, 2010 (a single year), the present\nholding does not act as a green light for disclosure. As the Court expresses above, requests for additional years of\ndata (even if requested in increments of single years) that would enable the presently requested data to be trended is\na distinguishable set of facts that requires an entirely separate and new analysis.\n\n                                                         22\n\f       HHS objects to disclosure of Section II, Line 2 (“Member Months”) because release of\n\nthat information would provide “insight into enrollment stability and market share.” Rice Decl. ¶\n\n18; see also Marquis Decl. ¶ 24. Dr. Biles contends that enrollment data is already publicly\n\navailable, Pl.’s Mem. 38 (citing Rice Decl. ¶ 14 (stating that each month since August 2006,\n\nCMS has posted on its website the number of enrollees in each MA plan.)), but the public data’s\n\ndetail, as compared to the requested data’s detail, is disputed by HHS. Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.\n\nStill, regardless of whether or not the data is publicly available, HHS fails to show how “insight\n\ninto enrollment stability and market share” will likely cause substantial competitive harm to an\n\nMAO, thereby failing to meet its burden of proof for this claim.\n\n       In addition to HHS/CMS employees, several MAO officials provided declarations in\n\nsupport of HHS. The MAO officials’ main objections regarded the release of Section II “risk\n\nscores,” Section III “cost structure” and “utilization patterns,” and Section VI “expenses” and\n\n“profit/loss by plan.” Theisen Decl. ¶¶ 5, 9–11; Yui Decl. ¶ 14.\n\n       HHS contends that the disclosure of risk scores would “enable . . . competitors to devise\n\nstrategies aimed at unfairly attracting beneficiaries with higher or lower [health] scores,” which\n\nwould “disrupt [an MAO’s] risk pool” and “violate CMS’s requirement that plans ‘not design\n\nbenefit packages that discourage enrollment or encourage disenrollment of severely or\n\nchronically ill beneficiaries.’” Theisen Decl. ¶¶ 5a, 10a. However, HHS does not explain how a\n\ncompetitor would use the 2009 data to “devise strategies” or what those “strategies” would be\n\nand has not offered any evidence that affirms that an MAO would actually engage in the claimed\n\nactivity that apparently violates a CMS requirement. It is difficult to understand how MAOs\n\ncould successfully violate a “requirement” of CMS for very long without repercussions, and it is\n\nequally unclear why it would be “unfair[]” for competitors to try and attract beneficiaries with\n\n\n\n                                               23\n\fbetter or worse health when all MAOs would have equal access to the risk data and could\n\ntherefore all try to do the same thing. Further, “attracting beneficiaries” by way of “strategies”\n\nseems highly speculative when beneficiaries choose to enroll in a specific plan with a specific\n\nMAO based on various personal factors. See Biles Decl. ¶¶ 28–32, 135. Additionally, Dr. Biles\n\nclaims that risk scores, to the extent they would be used by competitors, are already publicly\n\navailable. Pl.’s Reply 14, 18–19 (citing Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 10). HHS asserts that the public risk\n\nscores are “not always identical” to the risk scores in Worksheet 1, but fails to explain why the\n\ndifference between the scores is commercially significant. 23 HHS’s vague, speculative claims\n\nand conclusory rebuttals to Dr. Biles’s counter evidence do not satisfy its evidentiary burden.\n\n         MAO officials claim that “cost structure” and “utilization patterns” data in Section III\n\nwould allow competitors or providers to use the information to “undercut [an MAO] in price\n\nnegotiations” when contracting. Yui Dec. ¶ 14; Theisen Decl ¶¶ 5b, 10b–c, 11. Dr. Biles claims\n\nthat the symmetric disclosure of the data, Pl.’s Reply 9–13, the stale nature of the 2009 data,\n\nBiles Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 91–96; Biles Decl. ¶ 124–27, the existing public and industry knowledge of\n\ncost and utilization information, Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 63, the inability to trend the requested data,\n\nPl.’s Reply 15–16, and the “high level of aggregation” of the Section III data 24 prevents a\n\n\n23\n   HHS notes that the non-ESRD risk score requested by Dr. Biles is “not always identical to the risk score that CMS\nmakes public.” Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 8. The actual risk score for each MAO is retroactively calculated and is publicly\navailable, while the projected risk score (the risk score Dr. Biles is requesting) is the risk score upon which the bid is\nbased is not publicly available. Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 25. Though HHS asserts that the actual risk score and the\nprojected risk score could differ, Rice Supp. Decl. ¶ 8, Dr. Biles notes that HHS does not offer any data\nsubstantiating the implied assertion of actual difference between projected and actual risk scores and explains that,\nsince MAOs have until June of the submission year to submit actuarially-certified risk score data, the projected risk\nscore should be quite close to the actual risk score. Biles Supp. Decl. ¶ 26. “Actuaries preparing Worksheet 1 for an\nMAO would, in light of past experience with the MAO’s enrollee pool, have a good understanding of the health\nstatus of the MAO’s enrollees” (which is the essence of the risk score). Id. Since MAO actuaries have access to\nactual risk scores for past years for all MAO plans and since the future projected risk scores are logically similar to\npast plan risk scores, any difference between the projected and actual risk scores should be so minimal as to make\nany difference irrelevant for purposes of research or competitors. Id.\n24\n  Dr. Biles explains that costs per member per month data is a combination of three factors and that the Section III\ndata “masks the relationship among [the three factors] for any individual plan, making it impossible to discern the\nextent to which a particular factor is responsible for cost.” Biles Decl. ¶ 113. “These numbers are at a high level of\n\n                                                           24\n\fcompetitor or a provider from effectively using the requested data to manipulate contract\n\nnegotiations, Biles Decl. ¶ 113. HHS fails to explain how a competing MAO or provider would\n\nuse the requested 2009 data to “undercut” an MAO in contract negotiations and does not provide\n\nsufficient evidence to rebut Dr. Biles’s contradicting and possibly nullifying claims.\n\n         Finally, HHS asserts that Section VI cost data would “provide information about the\n\nefficiency of operations and the financial position of the organization.” Rice Decl ¶ 20. Here,\n\nHHS’s claims are again too conclusory to satisfy their burden of proof. “Efficiency” and\n\n“financial position” are highly generalized terms that do not, in themselves, prove competitive\n\nharm; stating that disclosure of cost information would reveal “financial position” could describe\n\nany sort of disclosure of MAO information, including the disclosure of payment and enrollment\n\ninformation that CMS has already made public. MAO officials, on behalf of HHS, claim that the\n\n“expenses” and “profit/loss by plan” data in Section VI would “allow competitors and network\n\nproviders to build business strategies to unfairly target [an MAO’s] specific cost structure.”\n\nTheisen Decl. ¶ 5c. These claims are rebutted by Dr. Biles’s assertions of staleness, symmetric\n\ndisclosure, and public availability of the requested data. Biles Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 85–96; Pl.’s Reply\n\n9–13. But regardless of Dr. Biles’s contradicting evidence, an assertion that a competitor or\n\nprovider would “build business strategies to unfairly target [an MAO’s] specific cost structure,”\n\nwithout further explaining how the disclosure of the requested data would facilitate that activity,\n\nis exactly the sort of vague claim that is unacceptable as evidence of commercial harm.\n\n                           e. HHS’s Burden\n\n         HHS contends that releasing the requested data would “cause harm” by providing\n\n“proprietary plan information” that is not publicly available, which would result in “insight” into\n\naggregation so that a competing [MAO] could not learn anything about another [MAO’s] internal contracting\npolicies with hospitals or physicians or how their strategy for managing utilization of high costs procedures . . . is\ndesigned.” Id.\n\n                                                         25\n\fvarious aspects of an MAO’s operations like “market strategy” and “financial details.” Rice\n\nDecl. ¶ 18.    HHS asserts that disclosure of the information would be “inappropriate” and\n\n“unfair.” Rice Decl. ¶¶ 21–22; Marquis Decl, ¶ 26. Crucial, and missing, in HHS’s evidence is\n\nexactly how all of these consequences of disclosure would cause a likelihood of substantial\n\ncompetitive harm to MAOs. See Gov’t Accountability Project, 691 F. Supp. 2d at 175–76, 178–\n\n79 (agency failed to show “how” competitor would use data to its advantage or to competitor’s\n\ndisadvantage ). HHS does not even give examples of the extent of the harm or the type of harm\n\nthat would occur if the requested data were released. HHS has the burden of showing that\n\nsubstantial competitive harm is likely. HHS has failed to provide a single non-conclusory claim\n\nthat asserts anything beyond a possibility of competition and has failed to rebut Dr. Biles’s\n\nnullifying evidence with affirmative, non-conclusory counter evidence.           “Conclusory and\n\ngeneralized allegations of substantial competitive harm, of course, are unacceptable and cannot\n\nsupport an agency’s decision to withhold requested documents.” Pub.

Thus, summary judgment in favor of Dr. Biles is\n\nappropriate.\n\nIV.    ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS\n\n       Dr. Biles has moved for attorneys’ fees and costs. Pl.’s Compl. 5 ¶ 5 (Relief). Though\n\nDr. Biles has prevailed and though FOIA gives this Court authority to award attorneys’ fees to\n\nDr. Biles, 5 U.S.C. § (a)(4)(E)(i) (2012), the Court will not address that request here. Pursuant to\n\nthe local rules, the Court shall “enter an order directing the parties to confer and to attempt to\n\nreach agreement on fee issues” and shall set a status conference at which the Court will (1)\n\n\n\n                                                26\n\fdetermine whether settlement of any and or all aspects of the fee matter has been reached, (2)\n\nenter judgment for any fee on which agreement has been reached, (3) make the determination\n\nregarding pending appeals required by paragraph (b) of LCvR 54.2, and (4) set an appropriate\n\nschedule for completion of the fee litigation.\n\nV.     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be DENIED\n\nand plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment will be GRANTED. Defendant is ordered to\n\ndisclose to plaintiff, in the form requested by plaintiff, all information requested in plaintiff’s\n\nJuly 18, 2011, FOIA request submitted to CMS.\n\n       A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion shall issue this date.\n\n       Signed by Royce C.
