The district court granted the couples’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment and enjoined Virginia from enforcing the laws.\n\nThis appeal followed.         Because we conclude that Virginia’s same-\n\nsex   marriage       bans   impermissibly      infringe        on    its    citizens’\n\nfundamental right to marry, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      This case concerns a series of statutory and constitutional\n\nmechanisms that Virginia employed to prohibit legal recognition\n\nfor same-sex relationships in that state. 1               Virginia enacted the\n\n\n      1\n       Three other states in this Circuit have similar bans:\nNorth Carolina, N.C. Const. art. XIV, § 6; N.C. Gen. Stat.\n§§ 51-1, 51-1.2; South Carolina, S.C. Const. art. XVII, § 15;\nS.C. Code Ann. §§ 20-1-10, 20-1-15; and West Virginia, W. Va.\nCode § 48-2-603.    The Southern District of West Virginia has\nstayed a challenge to West Virginia’s statute pending our\nresolution of this appeal.     McGee v. Cole, No. 3:13-cv-24068\n(S.D. W. Va. June 10, 2014) (order directing stay).\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\ffirst of these laws in 1975:                 Virginia Code section 20-45.2,\n\nwhich provides that “marriage between persons of the same sex is\n\nprohibited.”         After the Supreme Court of Hawaii took steps to\n\nlegalize same-sex marriage in the mid-1990s, Virginia amended\n\nsection 20-45.2 to specify that “[a]ny marriage entered into by\n\npersons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall\n\nbe void in all respects in Virginia and any contractual rights\n\ncreated by such marriage shall be void and unenforceable.”                        In\n\n2004, Virginia added civil unions and similar arrangements to\n\nthe    list     of     prohibited      same-sex    relationships        via      the\n\nAffirmation of Marriage Act.           See Va. Code Ann. § 20-45.3.\n\n       Virginia’s      efforts   to    ban    same-sex    marriage    and     other\n\nlegally      recognized    same-sex     relationships      culminated       in   the\n\nMarshall/Newman Amendment to the Virginia Constitution:\n\n       That only a union between one man and one woman may be\n       a marriage valid in or recognized by this Commonwealth\n       and its political subdivisions.\n\n       This Commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall\n       not   create   or   recognize  a   legal  status   for\n       relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to\n       approximate the design, qualities, significance, or\n       effects of marriage. Nor shall this Commonwealth or\n       its political subdivisions create or recognize another\n       union, partnership, or other legal status to which is\n       assigned the rights, benefits, obligations, qualities,\n       or effects of marriage.\n\nVa. Const. art. I, § 15-A.              The Virginia Constitution imposes\n\ntwo hurdles that a potential amendment must jump before becoming\n\nlaw:   the    General     Assembly    must   approve     the   amendment    in   two\n\n                                        21\n\fseparate legislative sessions, and the people must ratify it.\n\nVa. Const. art. XII, § 1.                    The General Assembly approved the\n\nMarshall/Newman Amendment in 2005 and 2006.                                In November 2006,\n\nVirginia’s voters ratified it by a vote of fifty-seven percent\n\nto    forty-three       percent.            In        the    aggregate,       Virginia    Code\n\nsections 20-45.2 and 20-45.3 and the Marshall/Newman Amendment\n\nprohibit same-sex marriage, ban other legally recognized same-\n\nsex     relationships,         and       render        same-sex      marriages       performed\n\nelsewhere legally meaningless under Virginia state law.\n\n\n\n                                                 B.\n\n      Same-sex couples Timothy B. Bostic and Tony C. London and\n\nCarol    Schall    and       Mary    Townley          (collectively,        the    Plaintiffs)\n\nbrought    this    lawsuit          to     challenge         the    constitutionality       of\n\nVirginia Code sections 20-45.2 and 20-45.3, the Marshall/Newman\n\nAmendment,       and    “any    other        Virginia         law    that     bars    same-sex\n\nmarriage    or    prohibits          the    State’s         recognition       of   otherwise-\n\nlawful      same-sex           marriages              from         other      jurisdictions”\n\n(collectively,         the    Virginia       Marriage         Laws).         The     Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that the “inability to marry or have their relationship\n\nrecognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia with the dignity and\n\nrespect accorded to married opposite-sex couples has caused them\n\nsignificant hardship . . . and severe humiliation, emotional\n\ndistress, pain, suffering, psychological harm, and stigma.”\n\n                                                 22\n\f       Bostic    and    London      have    been         in    a    long-term,       committed\n\nrelationship with each other since 1989 and have lived together\n\nfor more than twenty years.                 They “desire to marry each other\n\nunder the laws of the Commonwealth in order to publicly announce\n\ntheir    commitment      to     one    another        and      to     enjoy    the     rights,\n\nprivileges, and protections that the State confers on married\n\ncouples.”        On July 1, 2013, Bostic and London applied for a\n\nmarriage license from the Clerk for the Circuit Court for the\n\nCity of Norfolk.             The Clerk denied their application because\n\nthey are both men.\n\n       Schall and Townley are women who have been a couple since\n\n1985    and    have    lived   together         as   a    family      for     nearly      thirty\n\nyears.        They were lawfully married in California in 2008.                               In\n\n1998,    Townley      gave    birth    to   the      couple’s         daughter,      E.   S.-T.\n\nSchall    and    Townley      identify      a   host      of       consequences      of    their\n\ninability       to    marry    in     Virginia       and       Virginia’s       refusal      to\n\nrecognize their California marriage, including the following:\n\n  •    Schall could not visit Townley in the hospital for several\n\n       hours when Townley was admitted due to pregnancy-related\n\n       complications.\n\n  •    Schall cannot legally adopt E. S.-T., which forced her to\n\n       retain an attorney to petition for full joint legal and\n\n       physical custody.\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\f  •   Virginia will not list both Schall and Townley as E. S.-\n\n      T.’s parents on her birth certificate.\n\n  •   Until February 2013, Schall and Townley could not cover one\n\n      another    on    their     employer-provided            health       insurance.\n\n      Townley   has   been   able     to   cover     Schall    on    her   insurance\n\n      since then, but, unlike an opposite-sex spouse, Schall must\n\n      pay state income taxes on the benefits she receives.\n\n  •   Schall and Townley must pay state taxes on benefits paid\n\n      pursuant to employee benefits plans in the event of one of\n\n      their deaths.\n\n  •   Schall    and   Townley    cannot       file   joint     state   income    tax\n\n      returns, which has cost them thousands of dollars.\n\n      On July 18, 2013, Bostic and London sued former Governor\n\nRobert     F.   McDonnell,      former        Attorney     General     Kenneth    T.\n\nCuccinelli,     and   George     E.   Schaefer,       III,     in    his    official\n\ncapacity as the Clerk for the Circuit Court for the City of\n\nNorfolk.     The Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on\n\nSeptember 3, 2013.      The First Amended Complaint added Schall and\n\nTownley    as   plaintiffs,     removed        McDonnell      and   Cuccinelli    as\n\ndefendants, and added Janet M. Rainey as a defendant in her\n\nofficial capacity as the State Registrar of Vital Records.                       The\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Virginia Marriage Laws are facially\n\ninvalid under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fthe Fourteenth Amendment and that Schaefer and Rainey violated\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 by enforcing those laws.\n\n       The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The\n\nPlaintiffs also requested a permanent injunction in connection\n\nwith   their     motion     for    summary    judgment         and   moved,    in     the\n\nalternative, for a preliminary injunction in the event that the\n\ndistrict court denied their motion for summary judgment.                              The\n\ndistrict court granted a motion by Michèle McQuigg—the Prince\n\nWilliam County Clerk of Court—to intervene as a defendant on\n\nJanuary 21, 2014.           Two days later, new Attorney General Mark\n\nHerring—as       Rainey’s     counsel—submitted           a     formal     change     in\n\nposition   and     refused    to     defend   the    Virginia        Marriage       Laws,\n\nalthough Virginia continues to enforce them.                         McQuigg adopted\n\nRainey’s prior motion for summary judgment and the briefs in\n\nsupport of that motion.\n\n       The district court held that the Virginia Marriage Laws\n\nwere unconstitutional on February 14, 2014.                      Bostic v. Rainey,\n\n970 F. Supp. 2d 456, 483 (E.D. Va. 2014).                      It therefore denied\n\nSchaefer’s       and   McQuigg’s      motions   for       summary        judgment     and\n\ngranted    the     Plaintiffs’      motion.         The       district    court     also\n\nenjoined       Virginia’s         employees—including           Rainey      and      her\n\nemployees—and Schaefer, McQuigg, and their officers, agents, and\n\nemployees from enforcing the Virginia Marriage Laws.                            Id. at\n\n\n\n                                         25\n\f484.    The court stayed the injunction pending our resolution of\n\nthis appeal.      Id.\n\n       Rainey, Schaefer, and McQuigg timely appealed the district\n\ncourt’s decision.         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291.      On   March   10,    2014,    we     allowed     the    plaintiffs    from\n\nHarris v. Rainey—a similar case pending before Judge Michael\n\nUrbanski     in   the   Western    District          of   Virginia—to     intervene.\n\nJudge Urbanski had previously certified that case as a class\n\naction on behalf of “all same-sex couples in Virginia who have\n\nnot married in another jurisdiction” and “all same-sex couples\n\nin Virginia who have married in another jurisdiction,” excluding\n\nthe    Plaintiffs.      Harris    v.   Rainey,        No.   5:13-cv-077,      2014   WL\n\n352188, at *1, 12 (W.D. Va. Jan. 31, 2014).\n\n       Our analysis proceeds in three steps.                    First, we consider\n\nwhether the Plaintiffs possess standing to bring their claims.\n\nSecond,      we   evaluate      whether        the    Supreme      Court’s    summary\n\ndismissal of a similar lawsuit in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810\n\n(1972) (mem.), remains binding.                Third, we determine which level\n\nof constitutional scrutiny applies here and test the Virginia\n\nMarriage Laws using the appropriate standard.                       For purposes of\n\nthis opinion, we adopt the terminology the district court used\n\nto describe the parties in this case.                     The Plaintiffs, Rainey,\n\nand    the   Harris     class    are   the      “Opponents”        of   the   Virginia\n\nMarriage Laws.       Schaefer and McQuigg are the “Proponents.”\n\n                                          26\n\f                                             II.\n\n     Before we turn to the merits of the parties’ arguments in\n\nthis case, we consider Schaefer’s contention that “[t]he trial\n\ncourt erred as a matter of law when it found all Plaintiffs had\n\nstanding and asserted claims against all Defendants.”                            We review\n\nthe district court’s disposition of cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment—including        its        determinations         regarding       standing—de\n\nnovo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmoving party.         Libertarian Party of Va. v. Judd, 718 F.3d 308,\n\n313 (4th Cir. 2013); Covenant Media of S.C., LLC v. City of N.\n\nCharleston,     493     F.3d    421,    427-28      (4th    Cir.     2007).           Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to\n\nany material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.”         Libertarian Party of Va., 718 F.3d at 313-14\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a)).\n\n     To     establish          standing       under        Article        III        of   the\n\nConstitution, a plaintiff must “allege (1) an injury that is\n\n(2) fairly      traceable       to     the    defendant’s         allegedly          unlawful\n\nconduct and that is (3) likely to be redressed by the requested\n\nrelief.”      Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 590\n\n(1992)    (quoting      Allen    v.    Wright,      468    U.S.    737,     751       (1984))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).                      The standing requirement\n\napplies    to    each     claim       that     a   plaintiff       seeks        to    press.\n\nDaimlerChrysler        Corp.     v.    Cuno,       547    U.S.     332,    352       (2006).\n\n                                             27\n\fSchaefer premises his argument that the Plaintiffs lack standing\n\nto bring their claims on the idea that every plaintiff must have\n\nstanding as to every defendant.                 However, the Supreme Court has\n\nmade it clear that “the presence of one party with standing is\n\nsufficient      to     satisfy        Article       III’s    case-or-controversy\n\nrequirement.”         Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic & Institutional\n\nRights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006); see also Dep’t of\n\nCommerce v. U.S. House of Representatives, 525 U.S. 316, 330\n\n(1999) (holding that a case is justiciable if some, but not\n\nnecessarily     all,    of     the    plaintiffs      have   standing       as    to   a\n\nparticular    defendant);         Vill.    of    Arlington    Heights       v.   Metro.\n\nHousing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 263-64 (1977) (same).                            The\n\nPlaintiffs’    claims       can   therefore       survive    Schaefer’s      standing\n\nchallenge     as     long    as      one   couple     satisfies    the       standing\n\nrequirements with respect to each defendant.\n\n       Schaefer serves as the Clerk for the Circuit Court for the\n\nCity    of   Norfolk.        In      Virginia,     circuit    court     clerks     are\n\nresponsible for issuing marriage licenses and filing records of\n\nmarriage.      Va. Code Ann. §§ 20-14, 32.1-267.                  Although Schall\n\nand Townley did not seek a marriage license from Schaefer, the\n\ndistrict court found that Bostic and London did so and that\n\nSchaefer     denied    their      request       because   they   are    a    same-sex\n\n\n\n\n                                           28\n\fcouple. 2   Bostic, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 462, 467.                   This license\n\ndenial   constitutes   an   injury   for   standing       purposes.      See   S.\n\nBlasting Servs., Inc. v. Wilkes Cnty., 288 F.3d 584, 595 (4th\n\nCir. 2002) (explaining that the plaintiffs had not suffered an\n\ninjury because they had not applied for, or been denied, the\n\npermit in question); Scott v. Greenville Cnty., 716 F.2d 1409,\n\n1414-15 & n.6 (4th Cir. 1983) (holding that denial of building\n\npermit constituted an injury).       Bostic and London can trace this\n\ndenial      to   Schaefer’s      enforcement         of      the      allegedly\n\nunconstitutional   Virginia    Marriage    Laws, 3    and    declaring    those\n\n\n\n     2\n       Schaefer contends that Schall and Townley cannot bring a\n§ 1983 claim against him for the same reason: he did not commit\nany act or omission that harmed them.      To bring a successful\n§ 1983   claim,   a  plaintiff  must  show   that  “the  alleged\ninfringement of federal rights [is] ‘fairly attributable to the\nstate[.]’”    Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 838 (1982)\n(quoting Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982)).\nSchaefer’s action in denying Bostic and London’s application for\na marriage license is clearly attributable to the state.     The\ndistrict court could therefore entertain a § 1983 claim against\nSchaefer without ascertaining whether he committed any action\nwith respect to Schall and Townley.\n     3\n       For this reason, and contrary to Schaefer’s assertions,\nSchaefer is also a proper defendant under Ex parte Young, 209\nU.S. 123 (1908).     Pursuant to Ex parte Young, the Eleventh\nAmendment does not bar a citizen from suing a state officer to\nenjoin the enforcement of an unconstitutional law when the\nofficer has “some connection with the enforcement of the act.”\nLytle v. Griffith, 240 F.3d 404, 412 (4th Cir. 2001) (emphasis\nomitted) (quoting Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at 157).   Schaefer\nbears the requisite connection to the enforcement of the\nVirginia Marriage Laws due to his role in granting and denying\napplications for marriage licenses.\n\n\n\n                                     29\n\flaws    unconstitutional            and    enjoining          their    enforcement       would\n\nredress    Bostic       and        London’s     injuries.             Bostic    and   London\n\ntherefore possess Article III standing with respect to Schaefer.\n\nWe consequently need not consider whether Schall and Townley\n\nhave standing to sue Schaefer.                     See Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S.\n\n433,    446-47    (2009)          (declining       to   analyze       whether    additional\n\nplaintiffs had standing when one plaintiff did).\n\n       Rainey—as    the       Registrar       of    Vital      Records—is       tasked    with\n\ndeveloping       Virginia’s         marriage       license      application       form    and\n\ndistributing it to the circuit court clerks throughout Virginia.\n\nVa.     Code     Ann.        §§    32.1-252(A)(9),            32.1-267(E).            Neither\n\nSchaefer’s nor Rainey’s response to the First Amended Complaint\n\ndisputes its description of Rainey’s duties:\n\n       Defendant    Rainey   is   responsible   for    ensuring\n       compliance with the Commonwealth’s laws relating to\n       marriage   in   general  and,  more   specifically,   is\n       responsible for enforcement of the specific provisions\n       at issue in this Amended Complaint, namely those laws\n       that limit marriage to opposite-sex couples and that\n       refuse to honor the benefits of same-sex marriages\n       lawfully entered into in other states.\n\nIn    addition     to    performing         these       marriage-related         functions,\n\nRainey    develops           and     distributes          birth       certificate     forms,\n\noversees the rules relating to birth certificates, and furnishes\n\nforms    relating       to    adoption     so      that    Virginia      can    collect    the\n\ninformation       necessary         to    prepare       the    adopted     child’s       birth\n\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\fcertificate.        Id. §§ 32.1-252(A)(2)-(3), (9), 32.1-257, 32.1-\n\n261(A)(1), 32.1-262, 32.1-269.\n\n     Rainey’s      promulgation     of    a     marriage   license   application\n\nform that does not allow same-sex couples to obtain marriage\n\nlicenses resulted in Schaefer’s denial of Bostic and London’s\n\nmarriage license request.           For the reasons we describe above,\n\nthis license denial constitutes an injury.                   Bostic and London\n\ncan trace this injury to Rainey due to her role in developing\n\nthe marriage license application form in compliance with the\n\nVirginia Marriage Laws, and the relief they seek would redress\n\ntheir injuries.       Bostic and London consequently have standing to\n\nsue Rainey.\n\n     Schall and Townley also possess standing to bring their\n\nclaims against Rainey.           They satisfy the injury requirement in\n\ntwo ways.        First, in equal protection cases—such as this case—\n\n“[w]hen    the    government     erects    a    barrier    that   makes    it    more\n\ndifficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it\n\nis for members of another group, . . . . [t]he ‘injury in fact’\n\n. . . is    the    denial   of    equal        treatment   resulting      from    the\n\nimposition of the barrier[.]”              Ne. Fla. Chapter of Associated\n\nGen. Contractors of Am. v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656,\n\n666 (1993).        The Virginia Marriage Laws erect such a barrier,\n\nwhich prevents same-sex couples from obtaining the emotional,\n\nsocial, and financial benefits that opposite-sex couples realize\n\n                                          31\n\fupon marriage.       Second, Schall and Townley allege that they have\n\nsuffered     stigmatic    injuries      due    to    their     inability       to   get\n\nmarried in Virginia and Virginia’s refusal to recognize their\n\nCalifornia        marriage.         Stigmatic         injury        stemming        from\n\ndiscriminatory      treatment      is   sufficient        to   satisfy     standing’s\n\ninjury requirement if the plaintiff identifies “some concrete\n\ninterest   with     respect   to    which     [he    or    she]    [is]    personally\n\nsubject to discriminatory treatment” and “[t]hat interest . . .\n\nindependently satisf[ies] the causation requirement of standing\n\ndoctrine.”        Allen, 468 U.S. at 757 n.22, abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, 134\n\nS.   Ct.   1377    (2014).      Schall      and     Townley     point     to   several\n\nconcrete ways in which the Virginia Marriage Laws have resulted\n\nin   discriminatory      treatment.       For     example,        they    allege    that\n\ntheir marital status has hindered Schall from visiting Townley\n\nin the hospital, prevented Schall from adopting E. S.-T., 4 and\n\nsubjected Schall and Townley to tax burdens from which married\n\nopposite-sex couples are exempt.                  Because Schall and Townley\n\nhighlight specific, concrete instances of discrimination rather\n\n\n\n      4\n       Virginia does not explicitly prohibit same-sex couples\nfrom adopting children.     The Virginia Marriage Laws impose a\nfunctional ban on adoption by same-sex couples because the\nVirginia   Code  allows   only   married  couples  or  unmarried\nindividuals to adopt children. Va. Code Ann. § 63.2-1232(A)(6).\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fthan making abstract allegations, their stigmatic injuries are\n\nlegally cognizable.\n\n     Schall    and    Townley’s       injuries      are   traceable     to   Rainey’s\n\nenforcement of the Virginia Marriage Laws.                      Because declaring\n\nthe Virginia Marriage Laws unconstitutional and enjoining their\n\nenforcement would redress Schall and Townley’s injuries, they\n\nsatisfy standing doctrine’s three requirements with respect to\n\nRainey.     In sum, each of the Plaintiffs has standing as to at\n\nleast one defendant.\n\n\n\n                                         III.\n\n     Having     resolved       the     threshold      issue     of     whether     the\n\nPlaintiffs have standing to sue Schaefer and Rainey, we now turn\n\nto the merits of the Opponents’ Fourteenth Amendment arguments.\n\nWe begin with the issue of whether the Supreme Court’s summary\n\ndismissal in Baker v. Nelson settles this case.                       Baker came to\n\nthe Supreme Court as an appeal from a Minnesota Supreme Court\n\ndecision,     which    held    that    a    state     statute    that    the     court\n\ninterpreted     to    bar     same-sex     marriages      did   not    violate    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses.\n\nBaker v. Nelson, 191 N.W.2d 185, 187 (Minn. 1971).                     At the time,\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1257 required the Supreme Court to accept appeals of\n\nstate supreme court cases involving constitutional challenges to\n\nstate statutes, such as Baker.                  See Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S.\n\n                                           33\n\f332, 344 (1975).         The Court dismissed the appeal in a one-\n\nsentence opinion “for want of a substantial federal question.”\n\nBaker, 409 U.S. 810.\n\n      Summary dismissals qualify as “votes on the merits of a\n\ncase.”      Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344 (quoting Ohio ex rel. Eaton v.\n\nPrice,   360    U.S.   246,    247     (1959))      (internal       quotation     marks\n\nomitted).      They therefore “prevent lower courts from coming to\n\nopposite     conclusions      on      the    precise       issues     presented      and\n\nnecessarily    decided.”        Mandel       v.   Bradley,    432     U.S.   173,    176\n\n(1977) (per curiam).          However, the fact that Baker and the case\n\nat   hand    address   the    same     precise       issues    does    not   end     our\n\ninquiry.       Summary   dismissals         lose     their    binding    force      when\n\n“doctrinal developments” illustrate that the Supreme Court no\n\nlonger views a question as unsubstantial, regardless of whether\n\nthe Court explicitly overrules the case.                   Hicks, 422 U.S. at 344\n\n(quoting Port Auth. Bondholders Protective Comm. v. Port of N.Y.\n\nAuth., 387 F.2d 259, 263 n.3 (2d Cir. 1967)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).        The district court determined that doctrinal\n\ndevelopments stripped Baker of its status as binding precedent.\n\nBostic, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 469-70.                     Every federal court to\n\nconsider     this   issue     since    the       Supreme   Court    decided     United\n\nStates v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), has reached the same\n\nconclusion.

Jan. 29, 2014).\n\n      Windsor concerned whether section 3 of the federal Defense\n\nof    Marriage     Act    (DOMA)   contravened      the    Constitution’s            due\n\nprocess   and    equal    protection      guarantees.       Section       3    defined\n\n“marriage” and “spouse” as excluding same-sex couples when those\n\nterms appeared in federal statutes, regulations, and directives,\n\nrendering legally married same-sex couples ineligible for myriad\n\nfederal benefits.         133 S. Ct. at 2683, 2694.               When it decided\n\nthe case below, the Second Circuit concluded that Baker was no\n\nlonger precedential, Windsor v. United States, 699 F.3d 169,\n\n178-79 (2d Cir. 2012), over the dissent’s vigorous arguments to\n\n                                       35\n\fthe contrary, see id. at 192-95 (Straub, J., dissenting in part\n\nand   concurring       in    part).    Despite          this    dispute,     the   Supreme\n\nCourt     did    not   discuss     Baker     in     its    opinion      or   during      oral\n\nargument. 5\n\n      The Supreme Court’s willingness to decide Windsor without\n\nmentioning Baker speaks volumes regarding whether Baker remains\n\ngood law.        The Court’s development of its due process and equal\n\nprotection jurisprudence in the four decades following Baker is\n\neven more instructive.              On the Due Process front, Lawrence v.\n\nTexas,     539    U.S.      558    (2003),        and   Windsor      are     particularly\n\nrelevant.         In   Lawrence,      the    Court        recognized       that    the    Due\n\nProcess Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments “afford\n\nconstitutional         protection     to     personal       decisions        relating      to\n\nmarriage,        procreation,       contraception,             family      relationships,\n\nchild rearing, and education. . . . Persons in a homosexual\n\nrelationship       may      seek   autonomy       for     these   purposes,        just    as\n\n\n      5\n       The constitutionality of a law that prohibited marriage\nfrom encompassing same-sex relationships was also at issue in\nHollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652 (2013), a case that the\nSupreme Court ultimately decided on standing grounds.   Although\nthe petitioners’ attorney attempted to invoke Baker during oral\nargument, Justice Ginsburg interjected:     “Baker v. Nelson was\n1971.   The Supreme Court hadn’t even decided that gender-based\nclassifications get any kind of heightened scrutiny. . . .\n[S]ame-sex intimate conduct was considered criminal in many\nstates in 1971, so I don’t think we can extract much in Baker v.\nNelson.” Oral Argument at 11:33, Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S.\nCt. 2652 (No. 12-144), available at 2013 WL 1212745.\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\fheterosexual persons do.”             Id. at 574.             These considerations led\n\nthe Court to strike down a Texas statute that criminalized same-\n\nsex sodomy.        Id. at 563, 578-79.               The Windsor Court based its\n\ndecision     to    invalidate         section       3     of        DOMA     on   the        Fifth\n\nAmendment’s       Due    Process      Clause.           The     Court       concluded        that\n\nsection 3 could not withstand constitutional scrutiny because\n\n“the principal purpose and the necessary effect of [section 3]\n\nare    to   demean      those   persons    who          are    in     a    lawful     same-sex\n\nmarriage,” who—like the unmarried same-sex couple in Lawrence—\n\nhave a constitutional right to make “moral and sexual choices.”\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2694-95.                These cases firmly position same-sex\n\nrelationships        within     the   ambit     of      the     Due        Process    Clauses’\n\nprotection.\n\n       The Court has also issued several major equal protection\n\ndecisions since it decided Baker.                The Court’s opinions in Craig\n\nv. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411\n\nU.S. 677 (1973), identified sex-based classifications as quasi-\n\nsuspect, causing them to warrant intermediate scrutiny rather\n\nthan    rational        basis   review,       see       Craig,        429     U.S.      at    218\n\n(Rehnquist,       J.,    dissenting)      (coining            the    term     “intermediate\n\nlevel scrutiny” to describe the Court’s test (internal quotation\n\nmarks   omitted)).        Two   decades    later,         in    Romer        v.   Evans,       the\n\nSupreme Court struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment\n\nthat    prohibited       legislative,      executive,            and       judicial      action\n\n                                          37\n\faimed at protecting gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals from\n\ndiscrimination.         517   U.S.    620,    624,     635   (1996).        The   Court\n\nconcluded that the law violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal\n\nProtection Clause because “its sheer breadth is so discontinuous\n\nwith   the    reasons    offered      for     it   that      the    amendment     seems\n\ninexplicable     by     anything      but     animus      toward     the    class   it\n\naffects,” causing the law to “lack[] a rational relationship to\n\nlegitimate state interests.”            Id. at 632.          Finally, the Supreme\n\nCourt couched its decision in Windsor in both due process and\n\nequal protection terms.          133 S. Ct. at 2693, 2695.                 These cases\n\ndemonstrate     that,    since       Baker,    the     Court       has   meaningfully\n\naltered the way it views both sex and sexual orientation through\n\nthe equal protection lens.\n\n       In light of the Supreme Court’s apparent abandonment of\n\nBaker and the significant doctrinal developments that occurred\n\nafter the Court issued its summary dismissal in that case, we\n\ndecline to view Baker as binding precedent and proceed to the\n\nmeat of the Opponents’ Fourteenth Amendment arguments.\n\n\n\n                                        IV.\n\n                                         A.\n\n       Our analysis of the Opponents’ Fourteenth Amendment claims\n\nhas    two   components.         First,       we   ascertain        what    level   of\n\nconstitutional scrutiny applies:               either rational basis review\n\n                                         38\n\for some form of heightened scrutiny, such as strict scrutiny.\n\nSecond, we apply the appropriate level of scrutiny to determine\n\nwhether the Virginia Marriage Laws pass constitutional muster.\n\n       Under both the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses,\n\ninterference with a fundamental right warrants the application\n\nof strict scrutiny. 6         Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\n\n719-20 (1997); Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 383 (1978).\n\nWe therefore begin by assessing whether the Virginia Marriage\n\nLaws infringe on a fundamental right.           Fundamental rights spring\n\nfrom       the   Fourteenth   Amendment’s     protection      of     individual\n\nliberty, which the Supreme Court has described as “the right to\n\ndefine      one’s   own   concept   of   existence,   of    meaning,    of   the\n\nuniverse, and of the mystery of human life.”               Planned Parenthood\n\nof Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992).                     This liberty\n\nincludes the fundamental right to marry.              Zablocki, 434 U.S. at\n\n383; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12 (1967); see Griswold v.\n\n       6\n       The Equal Protection Clause also dictates that some form\nof heightened scrutiny applies when a law discriminates based on\na suspect or quasi-suspect classification, such as race or\ngender. See City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S.\n432, 440-41 (1985); Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307,\n313-14 (1976) (per curiam).    This Court previously declined to\nrecognize sexual orientation as a suspect classification in\nThomasson v. Perry, 80 F.3d 915, 928 (4th Cir. 1996) (en banc),\nand Veney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 731-32 (4th Cir. 2002).\nBecause we conclude that the Virginia Marriage Laws warrant\nstrict scrutiny due to their infringement of the fundamental\nright to marry, we need not reach the question of whether\nThomasson and Veney remain good law.\n\n\n\n                                         39\n\fConnecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485-86 (1965) (placing the right to\n\nmarry within the fundamental right to privacy); see also Skinner\n\nv.   Oklahoma      ex    rel.        Williamson,        316    U.S.    535,     541    (1942)\n\n(characterizing marriage as “one of the basic civil rights of\n\nman”);      Maynard     v.     Hill,    125   U.S.       190,    205    (1888)        (calling\n\nmarriage      “the      most     important         relation      in     life”    and     “the\n\nfoundation of the family and of society, without which there\n\nwould be neither civilization nor progress”).\n\n       The   Opponents         and    Proponents        agree    that    marriage        is   a\n\nfundamental right.             They strongly disagree, however, regarding\n\nwhether that right encompasses the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Opponents argue that the fundamental right to marry belongs\n\nto the individual, who enjoys the right to marry the person of\n\nhis or her choice.             By contrast, the Proponents point out that,\n\ntraditionally, states have sanctioned only man-woman marriages.\n\nThey contend that, in light of this history, the right to marry\n\ndoes not include a right to same-sex marriage.\n\n       Relying on Washington v. Glucksberg, the Proponents aver\n\nthat   the    district         court    erred      by    not    requiring       “a    careful\n\ndescription of the asserted fundamental liberty interest,” 521\n\nU.S.   at    721     (internal        quotation      marks      omitted),       which    they\n\ncharacterize as the right to “marriage to another person of the\n\nsame sex,” not the right to marry.                       In Glucksberg, the Supreme\n\nCourt described the right at issue as “a right to commit suicide\n\n                                              40\n\fwith another’s assistance.”           Id. at 724.       The Court declined to\n\ncategorize this right as a new fundamental right because it was\n\nnot, “objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and\n\ntradition.”        See id. at 720-21 (quoting Moore v. City of E.\n\nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503 (1977)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     The Proponents urge us to reject the right to same-\n\nsex marriage for the same reason.\n\n     We do not dispute that states have refused to permit same-\n\nsex marriages for most of our country’s history.                    However, this\n\nfact is irrelevant in this case because Glucksberg’s analysis\n\napplies    only     when   courts    consider      whether   to   recognize    new\n\nfundamental rights.         See id. at 720, 727 & n.19 (identifying the\n\nabove     process     as   a   way    of     “expand[ing]     the    concept    of\n\nsubstantive due process” beyond established fundamental rights,\n\nsuch as the right to marry (quoting Collins v. City of Harker\n\nHeights, 503 U.S. 115, 125 (1992)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).        Because we conclude that the fundamental right to\n\nmarry encompasses the right to same-sex marriage, Glucksberg’s\n\nanalysis is inapplicable here.\n\n     Over the decades, the Supreme Court has demonstrated that\n\nthe right to marry is an expansive liberty interest that may\n\nstretch to accommodate changing societal norms.                     Perhaps most\n\nnotably, in Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court invalidated a\n\nVirginia    law     that   prohibited      white   individuals    from   marrying\n\n                                        41\n\findividuals of other races.                388 U.S. at 4.             The Court explained\n\nthat “[t]he freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of\n\nthe vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of\n\nhappiness by free men” and that no valid basis justified the\n\nVirginia     law’s     infringement           of       that     right.         Id.     at    12.\n\nSubsequently,        in       Zablocki      v.        Redhail,       the    Supreme         Court\n\nconsidered    the     constitutionality               of   a   Wisconsin       statute       that\n\nrequired people obligated to pay child support to obtain a court\n\norder granting permission to marry before they could receive a\n\nmarriage    license.           434     U.S.      at    375,     383-84.        The     statute\n\nspecified     that        a    court      should        grant        permission       only    to\n\napplicants who proved that they had complied with their child\n\nsupport obligations and demonstrated that their children were\n\nnot likely to become “public charges.”                           Id. at 375 (internal\n\nquotation    marks        omitted).         The       Court    held     that   the     statute\n\nimpermissibly infringed on the right to marry.                             See id. at 390-\n\n91.   Finally, in Turner v. Safley, the Court determined that a\n\nMissouri    regulation         that       generally        prohibited      prison      inmates\n\nfrom marrying was an unconstitutional breach of the right to\n\nmarry.   482 U.S. 78, 82, 94-99 (1987).\n\n      These cases do not define the rights in question as “the\n\nright to interracial marriage,” “the right of people owing child\n\nsupport to marry,” and “the right of prison inmates to marry.”\n\nInstead,    they     speak      of    a    broad      right     to    marry    that    is     not\n\n                                              42\n\fcircumscribed based on the characteristics of the individuals\n\nseeking       to    exercise          that     right.             The     Supreme          Court’s\n\nunwillingness        to    constrain         the        right     to     marry      to    certain\n\nsubspecies of marriage meshes with its conclusion that the right\n\nto marry is a matter of “freedom of choice,” Zablocki, 434 U.S.\n\nat 387, that “resides with the individual,” Loving, 388 U.S. at\n\n12.     If courts limited the right to marry to certain couplings,\n\nthey    would      effectively         create       a    list     of     legally         preferred\n\nspouses, rendering the choice of whom to marry a hollow choice\n\nindeed.\n\n       The Proponents point out that Loving, Zablocki, and Turner\n\neach involved opposite-sex couples.                       They contend that, because\n\nthe     couples     in     those       cases        chose       to     enter     opposite-sex\n\nmarriages, we cannot use them to conclude that the Supreme Court\n\nwould grant the same level of constitutional protection to the\n\nchoice to marry a person of the same sex.                              However, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decisions in Lawrence and Windsor suggest otherwise.                                    In\n\nLawrence, the Court expressly refused to narrowly define the\n\nright    at    issue      as    the    right       of    “homosexuals          to    engage    in\n\nsodomy,” concluding that doing so would constitute a “failure to\n\nappreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.”                                  539 U.S. at\n\n566-67.       Just as it has done in the right-to-marry arena, the\n\nCourt identified the right at issue in Lawrence as a matter of\n\nchoice,    explaining          that    gay   and        lesbian      individuals—like          all\n\n                                               43\n\fpeople—enjoy         the     right    to     make       decisions        regarding         their\n\npersonal relationships.               Id. at 567.                 As we note above, the\n\nCourt reiterated this theme in Windsor, in which it based its\n\nconclusion that section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional, in part,\n\non     that    provision’s         disrespect       for      the     “moral       and     sexual\n\nchoices” that accompany a same-sex couple’s decision to marry.\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2694.                 Lawrence and Windsor indicate that the\n\nchoices       that   individuals        make       in     the      context       of     same-sex\n\nrelationships enjoy the same constitutional protection as the\n\nchoices accompanying opposite-sex relationships.                                 We therefore\n\nhave no reason to suspect that the Supreme Court would accord\n\nthe choice to marry someone of the same sex any less respect\n\nthan the choice to marry an opposite-sex individual who is of a\n\ndifferent       race,        owes     child        support,         or     is     imprisoned.\n\nAccordingly,         we      decline        the      Proponents’           invitation          to\n\ncharacterize the right at issue in this case as the right to\n\nsame-sex marriage rather than simply the right to marry.\n\n       Of course, “[b]y reaffirming the fundamental character of\n\nthe right to marry, we do not mean to suggest that every state\n\nregulation      which       relates    in   any     way      to    the   incidents        of   or\n\nprerequisites         for     marriage      must        be    subjected          to     rigorous\n\nscrutiny.”       Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 386.                   Strict scrutiny applies\n\nonly    when    laws       “significantly         interfere”        with     a    fundamental\n\nright.         See    id.     at    386-87.         The      Virginia        Marriage       Laws\n\n                                              44\n\funquestionably satisfy this requirement:                          they impede the right\n\nto     marry      by    preventing      same-sex          couples      from   marrying       and\n\nnullifying        the    legal     import     of       their     out-of-state      marriages.\n\nStrict scrutiny therefore applies in this case.\n\n\n\n                                                  B.\n\n       Under      strict    scrutiny,         a    law    “may    be    justified     only    by\n\ncompelling        state     interests,         and       must    be    narrowly     drawn    to\n\nexpress       only      those    interests.”             Carey    v.    Population     Servs.\n\nInt’l, 431 U.S. 678, 686 (1977).                       The Proponents bear the burden\n\nof demonstrating that the Virginia Marriage Laws satisfy this\n\nstandard, see Fisher v. Univ. of Tex. at Austin, 133 S. Ct.\n\n2411,      2420    (2013),       and   they       must    rely    on    the   laws’   “actual\n\npurpose[s]” rather than hypothetical justifications, see Shaw v.\n\nHunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908 n.4 (1996).                       The Proponents 7 contend that\n\nfive compelling interests undergird the Virginia Marriage Laws:\n\n(1) Virginia’s federalism-based interest in maintaining control\n\nover    the    definition        of    marriage        within     its    borders,     (2)    the\n\nhistory and tradition of opposite-sex marriage, (3) protecting\n\nthe     institution         of     marriage,           (4)      encouraging       responsible\n\n       7\n       Although some of these arguments appear only in McQuigg’s\nbriefs, we attribute them to the Proponents because Schaefer\n“reserved the right to adopt and incorporate in whole or in\npart” McQuigg’s discussion of the rationales underlying the\nVirginia Marriage Laws.\n\n\n\n                                                  45\n\fprocreation,         and    (5)      promoting     the     optimal       childrearing\n\nenvironment.      We discuss each of these interests in turn.\n\n\n\n                                    1.     Federalism\n\n       The Constitution does not grant the federal government any\n\nauthority      over    domestic      relations    matters,      such    as   marriage.\n\nAccordingly,      throughout         our    country’s     history,       states    have\n\nenjoyed the freedom to define and regulate marriage as they see\n\nfit.       See Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2691-92.                 States’ control over\n\nmarriage      laws     within     their      borders     has    resulted     in    some\n\nvariation      among       states’       requirements.         For     example,    West\n\nVirginia      prohibits     first     cousins     from   marrying,      W.   Va.   Code\n\n§ 48-2-302, but the remaining states in this Circuit allow first\n\ncousin marriage, see Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 2-202; N.C. Gen.\n\nStat. § 51-3; S.C. Code Ann. § 20-1-10; Va. Code Ann. § 20-38.1.\n\nStates’ power to define and regulate marriage also accounts for\n\ntheir differing treatment of same-sex couples.\n\n       The Windsor decision rested in part on the Supreme Court’s\n\nrespect for states’ supremacy in the domestic relations sphere. 8\n\n\n       8\n        In Windsor, the Court did not label the type of\nconstitutional scrutiny it applied, leaving us unsure how the\nCourt would fit its federalism discussion within a traditional\nheightened scrutiny or rational basis analysis.     The lower\ncourts have taken differing approaches, with some discussing\nWindsor and federalism as a threshold matter, see, e.g., Wolf,\n2014 WL 2558444, at *8-12; Bishop v. United States ex rel.\n\n\n                                             46\n\fThe Court recognized that section 3 of DOMA upset the status quo\n\nby robbing states of their ability to define marriage.                          Although\n\nstates could legalize same-sex marriage, they could not ensure\n\nthat the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage would\n\nbe uniform within their borders.                      See Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at\n\n2692.       However, the Court did not lament that section 3 had\n\nusurped states’ authority over marriage due to its desire to\n\nsafeguard federalism.            Id. (“[T]he State’s power in defining the\n\nmarital     relation      is   of    central        relevance    in   this   case   quite\n\napart from the principles of federalism.”).                       Its concern sprung\n\nfrom section        3’s   creation        of    two   classes    of   married    couples\n\nwithin states that had legalized same-sex marriage:                           opposite-\n\nsex couples, whose marriages the federal government recognized,\n\nand    same-sex     couples,        whose      marriages   the    federal    government\n\nignored.      Id.    The resulting injury to same-sex couples served\n\nas    the   foundation     for      the     Court’s    conclusion     that   section    3\n\nviolated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.                       Id. at 2693.\n\n\n\nHolder, 962 F. Supp. 2d 1252, 1277-79 (N.D. Okla. 2014); Kitchen\nv. Herbert, 961 F. Supp. 2d 1181, 1193-94 (D. Utah 2013), and\nothers—such as the district court in this case—considering\nfederalism as a state interest underlying the same-sex marriage\nbans at issue, see, e.g., Latta, 2014 WL 1909999, at *25-26;\nDeBoer, 973 F. Supp. 2d at 773-75; Bostic, 970 F. Supp. 2d at\n475-77.    Although we follow the district court’s lead and\nsituate our federalism discussion within our application of\nstrict scrutiny, our conclusion would remain the same even if we\nselected an alternate organizational approach.\n\n\n\n                                               47\n\f       Citing Windsor, the Proponents urge us to view Virginia’s\n\nfederalism-based        interest       in    defining        marriage        as    a   suitable\n\njustification for the Virginia Marriage Laws.                           However, Windsor\n\nis actually detrimental to their position.                          Although the Court\n\nemphasized     states’      traditional            authority       over       marriage,      it\n\nacknowledged        that    “[s]tate          laws       defining           and     regulating\n\nmarriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of\n\npersons.”     Id. at 2691 (citing Loving, 388 U.S. 1); see also id.\n\nat 2692 (“The States’ interest in defining and regulating the\n\nmarital relation[] [is] subject to constitutional guarantees.”).\n\nWindsor does not teach us that federalism principles can justify\n\ndepriving      individuals        of        their     constitutional              rights;    it\n\nreiterates     Loving’s     admonition            that    the    states       must     exercise\n\ntheir    authority      without      trampling           constitutional            guarantees.\n\nVirginia’s      federalism-based             interest        in     defining           marriage\n\ntherefore     cannot    justify        its    encroachment         on       the    fundamental\n\nright to marry.\n\n       The    Supreme      Court’s       recent          decision       in        Schuette   v.\n\nCoalition to Defend Affirmative Action, 134 S. Ct. 1623 (2014),\n\ndoes    not   change    the    conclusion           that     Windsor         dictates.       In\n\nSchuette,     the   Court     refused        to     strike      down    a    voter-approved\n\nstate constitutional amendment that barred public universities\n\nin Michigan from using race-based preferences as part of their\n\nadmissions processes.          Id. at 1629, 1638.                The Court declined to\n\n                                              48\n\fclosely scrutinize the amendment because it was not “used, or\n\n. . . likely to be used, to encourage infliction of injury by\n\nreason of race.”       See id. at 1638.          Instead, the Court dwelled\n\non the need to respect the voters’ policy choice, concluding\n\nthat “[i]t is demeaning to the democratic process to presume\n\nthat the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this\n\nsensitivity on decent and rational grounds” and the judiciary’s\n\nrole was not to “disempower the voters from choosing which path\n\nto follow.”      Id. at 1635-38.\n\n     The      Proponents    emphasize   that    Virginia’s   voters   approved\n\nthe Marshall/Newman Amendment.               Like the Michigan amendment at\n\nissue    in     Schuette,    the   Marshall/Newman       Amendment    is   the\n\ncodification of Virginians’ policy choice in a legal arena that\n\nis fraught with intense social and political debate.              Americans’\n\nability to speak with their votes is essential to our democracy.\n\nBut the people’s will is not an independent compelling interest\n\nthat warrants depriving same-sex couples of their fundamental\n\nright to marry.\n\n     The very purpose of a Bill of Rights 9 was to withdraw\n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political\n     9\n       Of course, the Fourteenth Amendment is not part of the\nBill of Rights.     This excerpt from Barnette is nevertheless\nrelevant here due to the Fourteenth Amendment’s similar goal of\nprotecting unpopular minorities from government overreaching,\nsee Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 293 (1978),\nand its role in rendering the Bill of Rights applicable to the\nstates, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 147-48 (1968).\n\n\n                                        49\n\f          controversy, to place them beyond the reach of\n          majorities and officials and to establish them as\n          legal principles to be applied by the courts. One’s\n          right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech,\n          a free press, freedom of worship and assembly, and\n          other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote;\n          they depend on the outcome of no elections.\n\nW. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 638 (1943)\n\n(footnote added); see also Romer, 517 U.S. at 623 (invalidating\n\na voter-approved amendment to Colorado’s constitution); Lucas v.\n\nForty-Fourth Gen. Assembly of Colo., 377 U.S. 713, 736-37 (1964)\n\n(“A       citizen’s    constitutional            rights    can   hardly      be    infringed\n\nsimply because a majority of the people choose that it be.”).\n\nAccordingly,          neither      Virginia’s          federalism-based       interest    in\n\ndefining marriage nor our respect for the democratic process\n\nthat codified that definition can excuse the Virginia Marriage\n\nLaws’ infringement of the right to marry.\n\n\n\n                              2.     History and Tradition\n\n          The Proponents also point to the “history and tradition” of\n\nopposite-sex marriage as a compelling interest that supports the\n\nVirginia Marriage Laws.                  The Supreme Court has made it clear\n\nthat, even under rational basis review, the “[a]ncient lineage\n\nof    a    legal   concept        does     not    give    it   immunity     from    attack.”\n\nHeller      v.   Doe    ex    rel.    Doe,       509   U.S.    312,   326    (1993).      The\n\nclosely       linked      interest         of     promoting      moral      principles    is\n\nsimilarly        infirm      in    light    of    Lawrence:       “the      fact   that   the\n\n                                                 50\n\fgoverning    majority      in   a     State       has    traditionally   viewed    a\n\nparticular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for\n\nupholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor\n\ntradition    could    save      a    law    prohibiting       miscegenation      from\n\nconstitutional attack.”             539 U.S. at 577-78 (quoting Bowers v.\n\nHardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 216 (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also id. at 601 (Scalia,\n\nJ., dissenting) (“But ‘preserving the traditional institution of\n\nmarriage’ is just a kinder way of describing the State’s moral\n\ndisapproval of same-sex couples.”).                     Preserving the historical\n\nand   traditional     status        quo    is     therefore    not   a   compelling\n\ninterest that justifies the Virginia Marriage Laws.\n\n\n\n            3.   Safeguarding the Institution of Marriage\n\n      In   addition   to     arguing       that    history    and    tradition    are\n\ncompelling interests in their own rights, the Proponents warn\n\nthat deviating from the tradition of opposite-sex marriage will\n\ndestabilize the institution of marriage.                   The Proponents suggest\n\nthat legalizing same-sex marriage will sever the link between\n\nmarriage and procreation:            they argue that, if same-sex couples—\n\nwho cannot procreate naturally—are allowed to marry, the state\n\nwill sanction the idea that marriage is a vehicle for adults’\n\nemotional fulfillment, not simply a framework for parenthood.\n\nAccording to the Proponents, if adults are the focal point of\n\n                                           51\n\fmarriage, “then no logical grounds reinforce stabilizing norms\n\nlike sexual exclusivity, permanence, and monogamy,” which exist\n\nto benefit children.\n\n      We   recognize          that,    in   some    cases,      we    owe    “substantial\n\ndeference to the predictive judgments” of the Virginia General\n\nAssembly,    for       whom    the    Proponents     purport     to    speak.           Turner\n\nBroad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 195 (1997).                                 However,\n\neven if we view the Proponents’ theories through rose-colored\n\nglasses,     we       conclude       that   they    are   unfounded         for     two    key\n\nreasons.      First,          the    Supreme     Court    rejected      the       view    that\n\nmarriage is about only procreation in Griswold v. Connecticut,\n\nin which it upheld married couples’ right not to procreate and\n\narticulated       a    view    of     marriage     that   has   nothing       to    do    with\n\nchildren:\n\n      Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse,\n      hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of\n      being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way\n      of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not\n      political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial\n      or social projects. Yet it is an association for as\n      noble a purpose as any involved in our prior\n      decisions.\n\n381   U.S.    at       485-86;       see    also    Turner,     482    U.S.        at     95-96\n\n(describing       many    non-procreative          purposes     of    marriage).            The\n\nfact that marriage’s stabilizing norms have endured in the five\n\ndecades since the Supreme Court made this pronouncement weakens\n\n\n\n\n                                              52\n\fthe argument that couples remain in monogamous marriages only\n\nfor the sake of their offspring.\n\n       Second, the primary support that the Proponents offer for\n\ntheir theory is the legacy of a wholly unrelated legal change to\n\nmarriage:           no-fault    divorce.        Although      no-fault   divorce\n\ncertainly altered the realities of married life by making it\n\neasier for couples to end their relationships, we have no reason\n\nto think that legalizing same-sex marriage will have a similar\n\ndestabilizing effect.          In fact, it is more logical to think that\n\nsame-sex couples want access to marriage so that they can take\n\nadvantage      of     its      hallmarks,      including     faithfulness    and\n\npermanence, and that allowing loving, committed same-sex couples\n\nto   marry     and    recognizing    their     out-of-state     marriages   will\n\nstrengthen the institution of marriage.                We therefore reject the\n\nProponents’ concerns.\n\n\n\n                         4.    Responsible Procreation\n\n       Next,   the    Proponents    contend     that   the   Virginia    Marriage\n\nLaws’ differentiation between opposite-sex and same-sex couples\n\nstems from the fact that unintended pregnancies cannot result\n\nfrom    same-sex      unions.        By     sanctioning      only   opposite-sex\n\nmarriages, the Virginia Marriage Laws “provid[e] stability to\n\nthe types of relationships that result in unplanned pregnancies,\n\nthereby   avoiding      or     diminishing     the   negative   outcomes    often\n\n                                          53\n\fassociated    with    unintended       children.”           The    Proponents      allege\n\nthat children born to unwed parents face a “significant risk” of\n\nbeing raised in unstable families, which is harmful to their\n\ndevelopment.        Virginia, “of course, has a duty of the highest\n\norder to protect the interests of minor children, particularly\n\nthose of tender years.”              Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 433\n\n(1984).        However,        the     Virginia       Marriage       Laws     are     not\n\nappropriately tailored to further this interest.\n\n        If Virginia sought to ensure responsible procreation via\n\nthe      Virginia      Marriage        Laws,        the     laws      are     woefully\n\nunderinclusive.        Same-sex couples are not the only category of\n\ncouples     who     cannot    reproduce          accidentally.         For    example,\n\nopposite-sex      couples     cannot     procreate        unintentionally       if   they\n\ninclude a post-menopausal woman or an individual with a medical\n\ncondition that prevents unassisted conception.\n\n      The Proponents attempt to downplay the similarity between\n\nsame-sex    couples    and     infertile         opposite-sex      couples    in     three\n\nways.      First,    they    point    out    that    sterile       individuals       could\n\nremedy their fertility through future medical advances.                               This\n\npotentiality,       however,    does     not      explain    why    Virginia       should\n\ntreat    same-sex    and     infertile      opposite-sex      couples       differently\n\nduring the course of the latter group’s infertility.                            Second,\n\nthe Proponents posit that, even if one member of a man-woman\n\ncouple is sterile, the other member may not be.                         They suggest\n\n                                            54\n\fthat,     without        marriage’s          monogamy      mandate,        this      fertile\n\nindividual is more likely to have an unintended child with a\n\nthird party.          They contend that, due to this possibility, even\n\nopposite-sex      couples        who     cannot      procreate      need     marriage       to\n\nchannel    their       procreative          activity    in    a    way     that    same-sex\n\ncouples    do     not.          The      Proponents’         argument      assumes       that\n\nindividuals      in    same-sex       relationships        never    have     opposite-sex\n\nsexual    partners,       which    is       simply   not     the   case.       Third,      the\n\nProponents       imply     that,       by    marrying,       infertile       opposite-sex\n\ncouples    set     a     positive       example      for     couples     who      can     have\n\nunintended children, thereby encouraging them to marry.                              We see\n\nno reason why committed same-sex couples cannot serve as similar\n\nrole models.           We therefore reject the Proponents’ attempts to\n\ndifferentiate         same-sex     couples      from    other      couples     who      cannot\n\nprocreate accidentally.               Because same-sex couples and infertile\n\nopposite-sex          couples      are       similarly        situated,        the      Equal\n\nProtection       Clause     counsels          against      treating        these        groups\n\ndifferently.       See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439 (explaining\n\nthat the Equal Protection Clause “is essentially a direction\n\nthat all persons similarly situated should be treated alike”).\n\n     Due to the Virginia Marriage Laws’ underinclusivity, this\n\ncase resembles City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.\n\nIn City of Cleburne, the Supreme Court struck down a city law\n\nthat required group homes for the intellectually disabled to\n\n                                              55\n\fobtain a special use permit.                   Id. at 447-50.             The city did not\n\nimpose       the    same    requirement        on    similar    structures,          such   as\n\napartment complexes and nursing homes.                      Id. at 447.          The Court\n\ndetermined         that    the   permit      requirement       was    so    underinclusive\n\nthat the city’s motivation must have “rest[ed] on an irrational\n\nprejudice,” rendering the law unconstitutional.                            Id. at 450.       In\n\nlight of the Virginia Marriage Laws’ extreme underinclusivity,\n\nwe are forced to draw the same conclusion in this case.\n\n       The    Proponents’        responsible         procreation          argument   falters\n\nfor another reason as well.                     Strict scrutiny requires that a\n\nstate’s means further its compelling interest.                              See Shaw, 517\n\nU.S.    at    915    (“Although        we    have    not   always         provided   precise\n\nguidance on how closely the means . . . must serve the end (the\n\njustification or compelling interest), we have always expected\n\nthat the legislative action would substantially address, if not\n\nachieve, the avowed purpose.”).                      Prohibiting same-sex couples\n\nfrom marrying and ignoring their out-of-state marriages does not\n\nserve    Virginia’s         goal       of    preventing     out-of-wedlock           births.\n\nAlthough      same-sex      couples         cannot   procreate       accidentally,       they\n\ncan and do have children via other methods.                               According to an\n\namicus brief filed by Dr. Gary J. Gates, as of the 2010 U.S.\n\nCensus, more than 2500 same-sex couples were raising more than\n\n4000    children      under      the    age     of   eighteen        in    Virginia.        The\n\n\n\n                                               56\n\fVirginia Marriage Laws therefore increase the number of children\n\nraised by unmarried parents.\n\n        The    Proponents       acknowledge          that       same-sex       couples       become\n\nparents.       They contend, however, that the state has no interest\n\nin   channeling         same-sex        couples’       procreative         activities          into\n\nmarriage      because        same-sex      couples        “bring    children          into    their\n\nrelationship[s] only through intentional choice and pre-planned\n\naction.”        Accordingly,            “[t]hose      couples       neither      advance        nor\n\nthreaten       society’s       public       purpose         for     marriage”—stabilizing\n\nparental relationships for the benefit of children—“in the same\n\nmanner, or to the same degree, that sexual relationships between\n\nmen and women do.”\n\n     In       support    of    this      argument,         the    Proponents          invoke    the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361\n\n(1974).       Johnson concerned educational benefits that the federal\n\ngovernment granted to military veterans who served on active\n\nduty.     Id. at 363.              The government provided these benefits to\n\nencourage enlistment and make military service more palatable to\n\nexisting       servicemembers.             Id.       at    382-83.         A    conscientious\n\nobjector—who       refused         to   serve    in       the    military       for    religious\n\nreasons—brought          suit,       contending           that    the   government            acted\n\nunconstitutionally            by    granting         benefits      to   veterans        but    not\n\nconscientious objectors.                 Id. at 363-64.              The Court explained\n\nthat,    “[w]hen,       as    in    this    case,         the    inclusion      of     one    group\n\n                                                57\n\fpromotes a legitimate governmental purpose, and the addition of\n\nother    groups       would       not,    we    cannot        say    that       the    statute’s\n\nclassification             of     beneficiaries          and        nonbeneficiaries            is\n\ninvidiously         discriminatory.”            Id.     at    383.          Because     offering\n\neducational         benefits       to     conscientious             objectors         would     not\n\nincentivize         military      service,       the    federal           government’s        line-\n\ndrawing was constitutional.                    Johnson, 415 U.S. at 382-83.                     The\n\nProponents claim that treating opposite-sex couples differently\n\nfrom    same-sex       couples      is    equally       justified           because     the    two\n\ngroups       are     not    similarly       situated          with        respect      to     their\n\nprocreative potential.\n\n       Johnson applied rational basis review, id. at 374-75, so we\n\nstrongly       doubt       its     applicability         to         our     strict      scrutiny\n\nanalysis.          In any event, we can easily distinguish Johnson from\n\nthe instant case.               In Johnson, offering educational benefits to\n\nveterans who served on active duty promoted the government’s\n\ngoal    of    making       military      service       more    attractive.             Extending\n\nthose     benefits         to    conscientious         objectors,           whose      religious\n\nbeliefs       precluded         military       service,        did        not   further       that\n\nobjective.           By     contrast,      a    stable        marital       relationship        is\n\nattractive          regardless       of    a     couple’s           procreative         ability.\n\nAllowing infertile opposite-sex couples to marry does nothing to\n\nfurther the government’s goal of channeling procreative conduct\n\ninto marriage.             Thus, excluding same-sex couples from marriage\n\n                                                58\n\fdue to their inability to have unintended children makes little\n\nsense.      Johnson therefore does not alter our conclusion that\n\nbarring same-sex couples’ access to marriage does nothing to\n\nfurther Virginia’s interest in responsible procreation.\n\n\n\n                               5.    Optimal Childrearing\n\n       We    now     shift      to     discussing            the     merit     of        the     final\n\ncompelling         interest         that    the       Proponents        invoke:                optimal\n\nchildrearing.            The Proponents aver that “children develop best\n\nwhen   reared       by    their      married      biological         parents        in    a     stable\n\nfamily      unit.”         They      dwell       on     the    importance           of     “gender-\n\ndifferentiated           parenting”        and    argue      that     sanctioning          same-sex\n\nmarriage will deprive children of the benefit of being raised by\n\na mother and a father, who have “distinct parenting styles.”                                       In\n\nessence, the Proponents argue that the Virginia Marriage Laws\n\nsafeguard children by preventing same-sex couples from marrying\n\nand starting inferior families.\n\n       The Opponents and their amici cast serious doubt on the\n\naccuracy of the Proponents’ contentions.                              For example, as the\n\nAmerican      Psychological                Association,            American         Academy         of\n\nPediatrics,          American          Psychiatric                 Association,            National\n\nAssociation         of    Social       Workers,         and        Virginia     Psychological\n\nAssociation        (collectively,           the       APA)    explain     in    their           amicus\n\nbrief,      “there        is    no     scientific             evidence       that         parenting\n\n                                                 59\n\feffectiveness is related to parental sexual orientation,” and\n\n“the      same      factors”—including                  family        stability,        economic\n\nresources,       and     the      quality    of     parent-child           relationships—“are\n\nlinked     to    children’s          positive          development,         whether    they    are\n\nraised by heterosexual, lesbian, or gay parents.”                                According to\n\nthe APA, “the parenting abilities of gay men and lesbians—and\n\nthe positive outcomes for their children—are not areas where\n\nmost credible scientific researchers disagree,” and the contrary\n\nstudies that the Proponents cite “do not reflect the current\n\nstate of scientific knowledge.”                         See also DeBoer, 973 F. Supp.\n\n2d   at   760-68       (making       factual      findings         and     reaching    the    same\n\nconclusion).            In    fact,    the       APA    explains      that,     by    preventing\n\nsame-sex        couples       from    marrying,          the       Virginia    Marriage       Laws\n\nactually harm the children of same-sex couples by stigmatizing\n\ntheir     families          and   robbing        them    of    the        stability,    economic\n\nsecurity, and togetherness that marriage fosters.                                    The Supreme\n\nCourt     reached       a    similar    conclusion            in    Windsor,     in    which    it\n\nobserved         that        failing        to     recognize              same-sex     marriages\n\n“humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by\n\nsame-sex    couples”          and    “makes       it    even       more    difficult    for    the\n\nchildren to understand the integrity and closeness of their own\n\nfamily and its concord with other families in their community\n\nand in their daily lives.”               133 S. Ct. at 2694.\n\n\n\n                                                  60\n\f       We find the arguments that the Opponents and their amici\n\nmake on this issue extremely persuasive.                          However, we need not\n\nresolve        this     dispute        because        the      Proponents’           optimal\n\nchildrearing argument falters for at least two other reasons.\n\nFirst, under heightened scrutiny, states cannot support a law\n\nusing “overbroad          generalizations          about     the    different    talents,\n\ncapacities, or preferences of” the groups in question.                                United\n\nStates    v.    Virginia,      518     U.S.    515,       533-34     (1996)    (rejecting\n\n“inherent differences” between men and women as a justification\n\nfor excluding all women from a traditionally all-male military\n\ncollege); see also Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 656-58\n\n(1972) (holding that a state could not presume that unmarried\n\nfathers     were       unfit    parents).            The     Proponents’      statements\n\nregarding same-sex couples’ parenting ability certainly qualify\n\nas   overbroad        generalizations.             Second,    as    we    explain     above,\n\nstrict scrutiny requires congruity between a law’s means and its\n\nend.     This congruity is absent here.                      There is absolutely no\n\nreason     to    suspect       that     prohibiting          same-sex      couples     from\n\nmarrying and refusing to recognize their out-of-state marriages\n\nwill cause same-sex couples to raise fewer children or impel\n\nmarried    opposite-sex         couples       to    raise     more       children.      The\n\nVirginia       Marriage    Laws       therefore      do     not    further     Virginia’s\n\ninterest in channeling children into optimal families, even if\n\n\n\n                                              61\n\fwe were to accept the dubious proposition that same-sex couples\n\nare less capable parents.\n\n       Because the Proponents’ arguments are based on overbroad\n\ngeneralizations about same-sex parents, and because there is no\n\nlink    between      banning      same-sex     marriage     and   promoting    optimal\n\nchildrearing,        this   aim     cannot     support      the   Virginia    Marriage\n\nLaws.       All of the Proponents’ justifications for the Virginia\n\nMarriage Laws therefore fail, and the laws cannot survive strict\n\nscrutiny.\n\n\n\n                                             V.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Virginia\n\nMarriage      Laws      violate    the   Due      Process   and   Equal    Protection\n\nClauses      of   the    Fourteenth      Amendment    to    the   extent     that   they\n\nprevent      same-sex     couples     from     marrying     and   prohibit    Virginia\n\nfrom        recognizing      same-sex          couples’      lawful    out-of-state\n\nmarriages.        We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and its decision to\n\nenjoin enforcement of the Virginia Marriage Laws. 10\n\n       10\n        Because we are able to resolve the merits of the\nOpponents’ claims, we need not consider their alternative\nrequest for a preliminary injunction.       We assume that the\ndistrict court’s decision to enjoin enforcement of the Virginia\nMarriage Laws encompassed a permanent injunction, which the\nPlaintiffs requested in connection with their motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n\n                                             62\n\f     We   recognize    that      same-sex     marriage   makes    some    people\n\ndeeply uncomfortable.            However, inertia and apprehension are\n\nnot legitimate bases for denying same-sex couples due process\n\nand equal protection of the laws.             Civil marriage is one of the\n\ncornerstones    of   our   way   of   life.     It   allows   individuals     to\n\ncelebrate and publicly declare their intentions to form lifelong\n\npartnerships,        which        provide        unparalleled        intimacy,\n\ncompanionship, emotional support, and security.                  The choice of\n\nwhether and whom to marry is an intensely personal decision that\n\nalters the course of an individual’s life.                 Denying same-sex\n\ncouples this choice prohibits them from participating fully in\n\nour society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the\n\nFourteenth Amendment cannot countenance.\n\n                                                                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                       63\n\fNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       To be clear, this case is not about whether courts favor or\n\ndisfavor      same-sex         marriage,         or    whether         States       recognizing      or\n\ndeclining to recognize same-sex marriage have made good policy\n\ndecisions.         It is much narrower.                 It is about whether a State’s\n\ndecision       not       to     recognize        same-sex             marriage       violates       the\n\nFourteenth         Amendment         of    the       U.S.    Constitution.                Thus,     the\n\njudicial       response         must      be    limited          to    an    analysis          applying\n\nestablished constitutional principles.\n\n       The    Commonwealth           of    Virginia         has       always       recognized      that\n\n“marriage” is based on the “mutual agreement of a man and a\n\nwoman to marry each other,” Burke v. Shaver, 23 S.E. 749, 749\n\n(Va. 1895), and that a marriage’s purposes include “establishing\n\na    family,       the    continuance           of    the    race,          the    propagation       of\n\nchildren,       and      the     general         good       of    society,”          Alexander       v.\n\nKuykendall, 63 S.E.2d 746, 748 (Va. 1951).                                  In recent years, it\n\ncodified      that       understanding           in    several         statutes,          which   also\n\nexplicitly exclude from the definition of “marriage” the union\n\nof   two     men    or    two    women.          Moreover,            in    2006    the    people    of\n\nVirginia       amended         the     Commonwealth’s             Constitution            to     define\n\nmarriage as only between “one man and one woman.”                                         Va. Const.\n\nart. I, § 15-A.\n\n       The         plaintiffs,            who         are        in        long-term           same-sex\n\nrelationships,            are        challenging            the        constitutionality             of\n\fVirginia’s      marriage       laws      under    the     Due       Process    and     Equal\n\nProtection Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.                         The district court\n\nsustained their challenge, concluding that the plaintiffs have a\n\nfundamental     right     to     marry    each    other       under   the     Due    Process\n\nClause   of     the     Fourteenth       Amendment       and    therefore       that     any\n\nregulation      of     that    right      is     subject       to     strict    scrutiny.\n\nConcluding that Virginia’s definition of marriage failed even\n\n“to display a rational relationship to a legitimate purpose and\n\nso must be viewed as constitutionally infirm,” the court struck\n\ndown Virginia’s marriage laws as unconstitutional and enjoined\n\ntheir enforcement.            Bostic v. Rainey, 970 F. Supp. 2d 456, 482\n\n(E.D. Va. 2014).\n\n     The majority agrees.                 It concludes that the fundamental\n\nright to marriage includes a right to same-sex marriage and that\n\ntherefore Virginia’s marriage laws must be reviewed under strict\n\nscrutiny.       It     holds     that    Virginia       has    failed    to    advance     a\n\ncompelling state interest justifying its definition of marriage\n\nas between only a man and a woman.                 In reaching this conclusion,\n\nhowever,      the     majority    has     failed     to       conduct    the    necessary\n\nconstitutional         analysis.          Rather,       it     has    simply        declared\n\nsyllogistically that because “marriage” is a fundamental right\n\nprotected by the Due Process Clause and “same-sex marriage” is a\n\nform of marriage, Virginia’s laws declining to recognize same-\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\fsex marriage infringe the fundamental right to marriage and are\n\ntherefore unconstitutional.\n\n       Stated   more    particularly,        the      majority’s       approach   begins\n\nwith the parties’ agreement that “marriage” is a fundamental\n\nright.       Ante at 40.           From there, the majority moves to the\n\nproposition that “the right to marry is an expansive liberty\n\ninterest,” ante at 41, “that is not circumscribed based on the\n\ncharacteristics        of    the   individuals          seeking   to    exercise     that\n\nright,” ante at 42-43.             For support, it notes that the Supreme\n\nCourt has struck down state restrictions prohibiting interracial\n\nmarriage, see Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967); prohibiting\n\nprison    inmates      from     marrying     without       special      approval,     see\n\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987); and prohibiting persons\n\nowing child support from marrying, see Zablocki v. Redhail, 434\n\nU.S.   374    (1978).         It   then   declares,        ipse   dixit,      that   “the\n\nfundamental right to marry encompasses the right to same-sex\n\nmarriage” and is thus protected by the substantive component of\n\nthe    Due   Process        Clause.       Ante     at    41.      In    reaching     this\n\nconclusion, the majority “decline[s] the Proponents’ invitation\n\nto characterize the right at issue in this case as the right to\n\nsame-sex marriage rather than simply the right to marry.”                            Ante\n\nat 44.       And in doing so, it explicitly bypasses the relevant\n\nconstitutional      analysis       required      by     Washington      v.   Glucksberg,\n\n521 U.S. 702 (1997), stating that a Glucksberg analysis is not\n\n                                           66\n\fnecessary because no new fundamental right is being recognized.\n\nAnte at 41-42.\n\n       This analysis is fundamentally flawed because it fails to\n\ntake    into    account        that     the    “marriage”         that     has     long     been\n\nrecognized      by     the     Supreme     Court      as    a     fundamental       right     is\n\ndistinct from the newly proposed relationship of a “same-sex\n\nmarriage.”          And this failure is even more pronounced by the\n\nmajority’s acknowledgment that same-sex marriage is a new notion\n\nthat    has     not     been     recognized         “for     most     of     our    country’s\n\nhistory.”       Ante at 41.           Moreover, the majority fails to explain\n\nhow this new notion became incorporated into the traditional\n\ndefinition of marriage except by linguistic manipulation.                                 Thus,\n\nthe    majority       never    asks     the   question       necessary       to     finding    a\n\nfundamental right -- whether same-sex marriage is a right that\n\nis “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and\n\n“implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither\n\nliberty       nor     justice     would       exist    if       [it   was]     sacrificed.”\n\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721 (quoting Moore v. East Cleveland,\n\n431    U.S.     494,     503      (1977)       (plurality          opinion);        Palko     v.\n\nConnecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325-26 (1937)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n       At bottom, in holding that same-sex marriage is encompassed\n\nby    the   traditional         right    to    marry,       the    majority        avoids   the\n\nnecessary constitutional analysis, concluding simply and broadly\n\n                                               67\n\fthat the fundamental “right to marry” -- by everyone and to\n\nanyone -- may not be infringed.                   And it does not anticipate or\n\naddress       the   problems   that     this       approach    causes,     failing   to\n\nexplain, for example, why this broad right to marry, as the\n\nmajority defines it, does not also encompass the “right” of a\n\nfather to marry his daughter or the “right” of any person to\n\nmarry multiple partners.\n\n       If     the   majority     were     to       recognize      and     address    the\n\ndistinction between the two relationships -- the traditional one\n\nand the new one -- as it must, it would simply be unable to\n\nreach the conclusion that it has reached.\n\n       I respectfully submit that, for the reasons that follow,\n\nVirginia was well within its constitutional authority to adhere\n\nto its traditional definition of marriage as the union of a man\n\nand a woman and to exclude from that definition the union of two\n\nmen or two women.          I would also agree that the U.S. Constitution\n\ndoes    not    prohibit    a   State    from      defining    marriage     to    include\n\nsame-sex marriage, as many States have done.                            Accordingly, I\n\nwould    reverse     the   judgment     of       the   district   court    and   uphold\n\nVirginia’s marriage laws.\n\n\n                                             I\n\n       As the majority has observed, state recognition of same-sex\n\nmarriage is a new phenomenon.                    Its history began in the early\n\n\n                                          68\n\f2000s with the recognition in some States of civil unions.                            See,\n\ne.g., Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, §§ 1201-1202 (2000); D.C. Code §\n\n32-701 (1992) (effective in 2002); Cal. Fam. Code §§ 297-298\n\n(2003); N.J. Stat. Ann. § 26:8A-2 (2003); Conn. Gen. Stat.

And the notion of same-sex\n\nmarriage   itself       first     gained       traction     in     2003,       when     the\n\nMassachusetts       Supreme           Judicial      Court         held        that      the\n\nCommonwealth’s prohibition on issuing marriage licenses to same-\n\nsex   couples     violated      the    State’s     Constitution          --   the     first\n\ndecision holding that same-sex couples had a right to marry.\n\nSee   Goodridge    v.   Dep’t     of    Pub.     Health,    798    N.E.2d      941,     968\n\n(Mass. 2003).      In 2009, Vermont became the first State to enact\n\nlegislation recognizing same-sex marriage, and, since then, 11\n\nother States and the District of Columbia have also done so.\n\nSee Conn. Gen.

See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652\n\n                                          69\n\f(2013); Varnum v.

This is indeed a recent phenomenon.\n\n     Virginia only recognizes marriage as between one man and\n\none woman, and, like a majority of States, it has codified this\n\nview.      See   Va.   Code   Ann.   §    20-45.2   (prohibiting   same-sex\n\nmarriage and declining to recognize same-sex marriages conducted\n\nin other States); id. § 20-45.3 (prohibiting civil unions and\n\nsimilar arrangements between persons of the same sex).             The bill\n\noriginally proposing what would become § 20-45.3 noted the basis\n\nfor Virginia’s legislative decision:\n\n     [H]uman marriage is a consummated two in one communion\n     of male and female persons made possible by sexual\n     differences which are reproductive in type, whether or\n     not they are reproductive in effect or motivation.\n     This present relationship recognizes the equality of\n     male and female persons, and antedates recorded\n     history.\n\nAffirmation of Marriage Act, H.D. 751, 2004 Gen. Assembly, Reg.\n\nSess. (Va. 2004).       The bill predicted that the recognition of\n\nsame-sex marriage would “radically transform the institution of\n\nmarriage with serious and harmful consequences to the social\n\norder.”    Id.   Virginia also amended its Constitution in 2006 to\n\n                                     70\n\fdefine marriage as only between “one man and one woman” and to\n\nprohibit    “a     legal    status       for   relationships        of     unmarried\n\nindividuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities,\n\nsignificance, or effects of marriage.”                Va. Const. art. I, § 15-\n\nA.   The    plaintiffs      commenced      this     action    to    challenge    the\n\nconstitutionality of Virginia’s marriage laws.\n\n     Plaintiffs Timothy B. Bostic and Tony C. London have lived\n\nin a committed same-sex relationship since 1989 and have lived\n\nin Virginia since 1991.         The two desired to marry in Virginia,\n\nand on July 1, 2013, when they applied for a marriage license at\n\nthe office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court for the City of\n\nNorfolk,    they   were    denied    a    license     and    told   that    same-sex\n\ncouples are ineligible to marry in Virginia.                  In their complaint\n\nchallenging Virginia’s marriage laws, they alleged that their\n\ninability to marry has disadvantaged them in both economic and\n\npersonal ways -- it has prevented them from filing joint tax\n\nreturns, kept them from sharing health insurance on a tax-free\n\nbasis, and signaled that they are “less than” other couples in\n\nVirginia.\n\n     Plaintiffs     Carol    Schall      and   Mary    Townley      likewise    have\n\nlived in a committed same-sex relationship since 1985 and have\n\nlived in Virginia throughout their 29-year relationship.                         In\n\n1998, Townley gave birth to a daughter, E.S.-T., whom Schall and\n\nTownley have raised together, and in 2008, the two traveled to\n\n                                         71\n\fCalifornia where they were lawfully married.                             They alleged in\n\ntheir complaint that because Virginia does not recognize their\n\nmarriage       as    valid,     they    have    been       injured      in    several      ways.\n\nSchall    is    unable     to    legally       adopt      E.S.-T.,      and    the    two    are\n\nunable to share health insurance on a tax-free basis.                                 The two\n\nalso claimed that they and E.S.-T. have experienced stigma as a\n\nresult of Virginia’s nonrecognition of their marriage.\n\n     The plaintiffs’ complaint, filed in July 2013, alleged that\n\nVirginia’s          marriage    laws    violate          their    constitutional        rights\n\nunder    the    Due     Process        and    Equal       Protection     Clauses       of    the\n\nFourteenth          Amendment.         They    named       as     defendants        George    E.\n\nSchaefer, III, Clerk of Court for the Norfolk Circuit Court, and\n\nJanet M. Rainey, the State Registrar of Vital Records.                                A third\n\nVirginia official, Michèle B. McQuigg, Clerk of Court for the\n\nPrince William County Circuit Court, was permitted to intervene\n\nas a defendant.           As elected circuit court clerks, Schaefer and\n\nMcQuigg are responsible for issuing individual marriage licenses\n\nin the localities in which they serve.                       And Rainey, as the State\n\nRegistrar       of      Vital    Records,           is    responsible         for     ensuring\n\ncompliance      with     Virginia’s          marriage      laws,    including        the     laws\n\nchallenged in this case.\n\n     After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nVirginia underwent a change in administrations, and the newly\n\nelected    Attorney       General       of    Virginia,          Mark   Herring,      filed    a\n\n                                               72\n\fnotice of a change in his office’s legal position on behalf of\n\nhis    client,    defendant     Janet     Rainey.       His   notice       stated   that\n\nbecause, in his view, the laws at issue were unconstitutional,\n\nhis office would no longer defend them on behalf of Rainey.                            He\n\nnoted, however, that Rainey would continue to enforce the laws\n\nuntil the court’s ruling.              The other officials have continued to\n\ndefend Virginia’s marriage laws, and, for convenience, I refer\n\nto the defendants herein as “Virginia.”\n\n       Following a hearing, the district court, by an order and\n\nmemorandum       dated   February       14,    2014,   granted       the    plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for summary judgment and denied Virginia’s cross-motion.\n\nThe court concluded that same-sex partners have a fundamental\n\nright to marry each other under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth     Amendment,       thus    requiring      that   Virginia’s      marriage\n\nlaws    restricting      that    right    be    narrowly      drawn    to    further    a\n\ncompelling state interest.              It concluded that the laws did not\n\nmeet    that     requirement     and,     indeed,      “fail[ed]      to    display     a\n\nrational relationship to a legitimate purpose, and so must be\n\nviewed as constitutionally infirm under even the least onerous\n\nlevel of scrutiny.”         Bostic, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 482.                    Striking\n\ndown Virginia’s marriage laws, the court also issued an order\n\nenjoining      their     enforcement      but     stayed      that    order     pending\n\nappeal.    This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                          73\n\f                                                  II\n\n       The     plaintiffs       contend          that,    as    same-sex     partners,        they\n\nhave    a    fundamental        right       to    marry    that     is   protected       by    the\n\nsubstantive          component    of    the       Due     Process    Clause      of   the     U.S.\n\nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (prohibiting any State\n\nfrom    depriving        “any     person         of     life,     liberty,    or      property,\n\nwithout due process of law”), and that Virginia’s laws defining\n\nmarriage as only between a man and a woman and excluding same-\n\nsex    marriage        infringe        on    that        right.       The    constitutional\n\nanalysis for adjudging their claim is well established.\n\n       The Constitution contains no language directly protecting\n\nthe right to same-sex marriage or even traditional marriage.\n\nAny    right    to     same-sex    marriage,             therefore,      would    have    to   be\n\nfound, through court interpretation, as a substantive component\n\nof     the     Due     Process     Clause.               See    Planned      Parenthood         of\n\nSoutheastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846 (1992) (“Although a\n\nliteral reading of the Clause might suggest that it governs only\n\nthe procedures by which a State may deprive persons of liberty,\n\nfor at least 105 years . . . the Clause has been understood to\n\ncontain a substantive component as well”).\n\n       The substantive component of the Due Process Clause only\n\nprotects “fundamental” liberty interests.                           And the Supreme Court\n\nhas held that liberty interests are only fundamental if they\n\nare, “objectively, ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and\n\n                                                  74\n\ftradition,’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’\n\nsuch that ‘neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were\n\nsacrificed.’”        Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720-21 (citation omitted)\n\n(quoting Moore, 431 U.S. at 503 (plurality opinion); Palko, 302\n\nU.S. at 325-26).         When determining whether such a fundamental\n\nright exists, a court must always make “a ‘careful description’\n\nof   the    asserted    fundamental    liberty     interest.”        Id.    at   721\n\n(emphasis     added)    (quoting    Reno    v.   Flores,    507   U.S.    292,   302\n\n(1993)).      This “careful description” involves characterizing the\n\nright asserted in its narrowest terms.                  Thus, in Glucksberg,\n\nwhere the Court was presented with a due process challenge to a\n\nstate      statute   banning   assisted      suicide,      the    Court    narrowly\n\ncharacterized the right being asserted in the following manner:\n\n      The Court of Appeals stated that “[p]roperly analyzed,\n      the first issue to be resolved is whether there is a\n      liberty interest in determining the time and manner of\n      one’s death,” or, in other words, “[i]s there a right\n      to die?”   Similarly, respondents assert a “liberty to\n      choose how to die” and a right to “control of one’s\n      final days,” and describe the asserted liberty as “the\n      right to choose a humane, dignified death,” and “the\n      liberty to shape death.”    As noted above, we have a\n      tradition of carefully formulating the interest at\n      stake in substantive-due-process cases. . . .      The\n      Washington statute at issue in this case prohibits\n      “aid[ing] another person to attempt suicide,” and,\n      thus, the question before us is whether the “liberty”\n      specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes\n      a right to commit suicide which itself includes a\n      right to assistance in doing so.\n\nGlucksberg,      521    U.S.   at    722-23      (alterations      in     original)\n\n(emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n                                       75\n\f     Under this formulation, because the Virginia laws at issue\n\nprohibit “marriage between persons of the same sex,” Va. Code\n\nAnn. § 20-45.2, “the question before us is whether the ‘liberty’\n\nspecially protected by the Due Process Clause includes a right”\n\nto same-sex marriage.            Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 723; see also\n\nJackson v. Abercrombie, 884 F. Supp. 2d 1065, 1095 (D. Haw.\n\n2012) (“[M]issing from Plaintiffs’ asserted ‘right to marry the\n\nperson of one’s choice’ is its centerpiece:                the right to marry\n\nsomeone of the same gender”).\n\n     When a fundamental right is so identified, then any statute\n\nrestricting the right is subject to strict scrutiny and must be\n\n“narrowly      tailored    to    serve    a   compelling    state    interest.”\n\nFlores, 507 U.S. at 302.           Such scrutiny is extremely difficult\n\nfor a law to withstand, and, as such, the Supreme Court has\n\nnoted   that    courts    must   be   extremely   cautious    in    recognizing\n\nfundamental rights because doing so ordinarily removes freedom\n\nof choice from the hands of the people:\n\n     [W]e “ha[ve] always been reluctant to expand the\n     concept of substantive due process because guideposts\n     for responsible decisionmaking in this unchartered\n     area are scarce and open-ended.”          By extending\n     constitutional protection to an asserted right or\n     liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place the\n     matter outside the arena of public debate and\n     legislative action.   We must therefore “exercise the\n     utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground\n     in this field,” lest the liberty protected by the Due\n     Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy\n     preferences of the Members of this Court.\n\n\n                                         76\n\fGlucksberg,    521     U.S.    at    720        (second     alteration        in   original)\n\n(emphasis added) (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503\n\nU.S. 115, 125 (1992)).\n\n       The   plaintiffs       in    this    case,      as    well      as    the   majority,\n\nrecognize that narrowly defining the asserted liberty interest\n\nwould require them to demonstrate a new fundamental right to\n\nsame-sex marriage, which they cannot do.                         Thus, they have made\n\nno attempt to argue that same-sex marriage is, “objectively,\n\ndeeply   rooted    in    this       Nation’s         history     and    tradition,”      and\n\n“implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.”                               Glucksberg, 521\n\nU.S. at 720-21 (internal quotation marks omitted).                             Indeed, they\n\nhave acknowledged that recognition of same-sex marriage is a\n\nrecent development.           See ante at 41; see also United States v.\n\nWindsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675, 2689 (2013) (“Until recent years, many\n\ncitizens had not even considered the possibility of [same-sex\n\nmarriage]”     (emphasis           added));          id.    at    2715        (Alito,    J.,\n\ndissenting) (noting that it is “beyond dispute that the right to\n\nsame-sex marriage is not deeply rooted in this Nation’s history\n\nand tradition”); Baehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 57 (Haw. 1993)\n\n(“[W]e do not believe that a right to same-sex marriage is so\n\nrooted in the traditions and collective conscience of our people\n\nthat   failure    to    recognize          it    would      violate     the     fundamental\n\nprinciples of liberty and justice that lie at the base of all\n\nour civil and political institutions”).\n\n                                                77\n\f     Instead, the plaintiffs and the majority argue that the\n\nfundamental     right        to   marriage     that    has     previously      been\n\nrecognized by the Supreme Court is a broad right that should\n\napply to the plaintiffs without the need to recognize a new\n\nfundamental right to same-sex marriage.                 They argue that this\n\napproach is supported by the fact that the Supreme Court did not\n\nnarrowly   define      the    right    to   marriage    in   its   decisions    in\n\nLoving, 388 U.S. at 12; Turner, 482 U.S. at 94-96; or Zablocki,\n\n434 U.S. at 383-86.\n\n     It    is   true    that,     in   those   cases,    the    Court    did   not\n\nrecognize new, separate fundamental rights to fit the factual\n\ncircumstances in each case.            For example, in Loving, the Court\n\ndid not examine whether interracial marriage was, objectively,\n\ndeeply rooted in our Nation’s history and tradition.                 But it was\n\nnot required to do so.            Each of those cases involved a couple\n\nasserting a right to enter into a traditional marriage of the\n\ntype that has always been recognized since the beginning of the\n\nNation -- a union between one man and one woman.                        While the\n\ncontext for asserting the right varied in each of those cases,\n\nit varied only in ways irrelevant to the concept of marriage.\n\nThe type of relationship sought was always the traditional, man-\n\nwoman relationship to which the term “marriage” was theretofore\n\nalways assumed to refer.           Thus, none of the cases cited by the\n\nplaintiffs and relied on by the majority involved the assertion\n\n                                        78\n\fof a brand new liberty interest.                 To the contrary, they involved\n\nthe assertion of one of the oldest and most fundamental liberty\n\ninterests in our society.\n\n       To now define the previously recognized fundamental right\n\nto    “marriage”    as    a    concept    that    includes     the    new    notion     of\n\n“same-sex marriage” amounts to a dictionary jurisprudence, which\n\ndefines terms as convenient to attain an end.\n\n       It   is    true    that    same-sex      and   opposite-sex      relationships\n\nshare many attributes, and, therefore, marriages involving those\n\nrelationships would, to a substantial extent, be similar.                              Two\n\npersons     who     are       attracted    to     each     other     physically       and\n\nemotionally and who love each other could publicly promise to\n\nlive    with      each    other     thereafter        in   a   mutually          desirable\n\nrelationship.        These aspects are the same whether the persons\n\nare    of   the    same     sex    or    different       sexes.       Moreover,      both\n\nrelationships       could      successfully      function      to    raise       children,\n\nalthough children in a same-sex relationship would come from one\n\npartner     or    from    adoption.        But    there     are     also    significant\n\ndistinctions        between       the     relationships        that        can     justify\n\ndifferential treatment by lawmakers.\n\n       Only the union of a man and a woman has the capacity to\n\nproduce children and thus to carry on the species.                               And more\n\nimportantly, only such a union creates a biological family unit\n\nthat also gives rise to a traditionally stable political unit.\n\n                                           79\n\fEvery       person’s      identity     includes       the     person’s        particular\n\nbiological        relationships,      which      create     unique    and     meaningful\n\nbonds of kinship that are extraordinarily strong and enduring\n\nand    that    have     been    afforded   a     privileged    place     in    political\n\norder      throughout     human     history.        Societies     have      accordingly\n\nenacted laws promoting the family unit -- such as those relating\n\nto sexual engagement, marriage rites, divorce, inheritance, name\n\nand title, and economic matters.                  And many societies have found\n\nfamilial bonds so critical that they have elevated marriage to\n\nbe    a    sacred   institution      trapped      with    religious     rituals.      In\n\nthese       respects,     the      traditional      man-woman        relationship     is\n\nunique.\n\n          Thus, when the Supreme Court has recognized, through the\n\nyears, that the right to marry is a fundamental right, it has\n\nemphasized        the    procreative       and    social     ordering       aspects   of\n\ntraditional marriage.            For example, it has said:             “[Marriage] is\n\nan institution, in the maintenance of which in its purity the\n\npublic is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the\n\nfamily      and   of    society,    without      which    there   would     be   neither\n\ncivilization nor progress,” Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 211\n\n(1888) (emphasis added); Marriage is “one of the basic civil\n\nrights of man.          Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the\n\nvery existence and survival of the race,” Skinner v. Oklahoma ex\n\nrel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942); “It is not surprising\n\n                                            80\n\fthat the decision to marry has been placed on the same level of\n\nimportance     as    decisions        relating       to    procreation,          childbirth,\n\nchildrearing, and family relationships. . . .                          [Marriage] is the\n\nfoundation of the family in our society,” Zablocki, 434 U.S. at\n\n386.\n\n       Because there exist deep, fundamental differences between\n\ntraditional       and      same-sex     marriage,          the     plaintiffs      and     the\n\nmajority   err      by     conflating        the    two    relationships          under    the\n\nloosely drawn rubric of “the right to marriage.”                                 Rather, to\n\nobtain constitutional protection, they would have to show that\n\nthe right to same-sex marriage is itself deeply rooted in our\n\nNation’s history.              They have not attempted to do so and could\n\nnot succeed if they were so to attempt.\n\n       In an effort to bridge the obvious differences between the\n\ntraditional relationship and the new same-sex relationship, the\n\nplaintiffs argue that the fundamental right to marriage “has\n\nalways been based on, and defined by, the constitutional liberty\n\nto select the partner of one’s choice.”                      (Emphasis added).            They\n\nrely heavily on Loving to assert this claim.                               In Loving, the\n\nCourt   held     that      a    state      regulation       restricting          interracial\n\nmarriage     infringed          on   the     fundamental          right     to    marriage.\n\nLoving, 388 U.S. at 12.                 But nowhere in Loving did the Court\n\nsuggest    that      the       fundamental         right    to     marry    includes       the\n\nunrestricted        right       to   marry     whomever          one   chooses,     as     the\n\n                                              81\n\fplaintiffs claim.            Indeed, Loving explicitly relied on Skinner\n\nand    Murphy,       and   both       of   those    cases    discussed        marriage     in\n\ntraditional, procreative terms.                   Id.\n\n       This reading of Loving is fortified by the Court’s summary\n\ndismissal       of   Baker       v.    Nelson,     191   N.W.2d    185       (Minn.    1971),\n\nappeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), just five years after\n\nLoving    was    decided.             In   Baker,    the    Minnesota        Supreme     Court\n\ninterpreted a state statute’s use of the term “marriage” to be\n\none of common usage meaning a union “between persons of the\n\nopposite sex” and thus not including same-sex marriage.                                Id. at\n\n186.     On appeal, the Supreme Court dismissed the case summarily\n\n“for want of a substantial federal question.”                           409 U.S. at 810.\n\nThe Court’s action in context indicates that the Court did not\n\nview    Loving       or    the    cases     that    preceded      it    as    providing     a\n\nfundamental right to an unrestricted choice of marriage partner.\n\nOtherwise, the state court’s decision in Baker would indeed have\n\npresented a substantial federal question.\n\n       In short, Loving simply held that race, which is completely\n\nunrelated to the institution of marriage, could not be the basis\n\nof    marital    restrictions.              See    Loving,   388   U.S.       at   12.      To\n\nstretch Loving’s holding to say that the right to marry is not\n\nlimited    by    gender      and       sexual      orientation     is    to    ignore     the\n\ninextricable, biological link between marriage and procreation\n\nthat the Supreme Court has always recognized.                           See Windsor, 133\n\n                                              82\n\fS. Ct. at 2689 (recognizing that throughout history, “marriage\n\nbetween a man and a woman no doubt had been thought of by most\n\npeople as essential to the very definition of that term and to\n\nits role and function”).          The state regulation struck down in\n\nLoving, like those in Zablocki and Turner, had no relationship\n\nto the foundational purposes of marriage, while the gender of\n\nthe individuals in a marriage clearly does.                Thus, the majority\n\nerrs, as did the district court, by interpreting the Supreme\n\nCourt’s marriage cases as establishing a right that includes\n\nsame-sex marriage.\n\n       The plaintiffs also largely ignore the problem with their\n\nposition that if the fundamental right to marriage is based on\n\n“the    constitutional   liberty    to     select   the    partner    of   one’s\n\nchoice,” as they contend, then that liberty would also extend to\n\nindividuals    seeking    state     recognition       of    other     types    of\n\nrelationships that States currently restrict, such as polygamous\n\nor incestuous relationships.        Cf. Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620,\n\n648-50 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting).             Such an extension would\n\nbe     a   radical    shift   in     our     understanding       of     marital\n\nrelationships.       Laws restricting polygamy are foundational to\n\nthe Union itself, having been a condition on the entrance of\n\nArizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah into statehood.                       Id.\n\nWhile the plaintiffs do attempt to assure us that such laws are\n\nsafe because “there are weighty government interests underlying”\n\n                                     83\n\fthem, such an argument does not bear on the question of whether\n\nthe   right    is   fundamental.         The    government’s       interests    would\n\ninstead be relevant only to whether the restriction could meet\n\nthe requisite standard of review.                And because laws prohibiting\n\npolygamous or incestuous marriages restrict individuals’ right\n\nto choose whom they would like to marry, they would, under the\n\nplaintiffs’ approach, have to be examined under strict scrutiny.\n\nPerhaps    the   government’s        interest     would    be    strong    enough    to\n\nenable such laws to survive strict scrutiny, but regardless,\n\ntoday’s decision would truly be a sweeping one if it could be\n\nunderstood to mean that individuals have a fundamental right to\n\nenter into a marriage with any person, or any people, of their\n\nchoosing.\n\n      At   bottom,     the       fundamental    right     to    marriage    does    not\n\ninclude    a   right   to    same-sex    marriage.         Under    the    Glucksberg\n\nanalysis that we are thus bound to conduct, there is no new\n\nfundamental      right      to     same-sex     marriage.          Virginia’s      laws\n\nrestricting marriage to man-woman relationships must therefore\n\nbe upheld if there is any rational basis for the laws.\n\n\n                                         III\n\n      Under rational-basis review, courts are required to give\n\nheavy deference to legislatures.               The standard\n\n      simply requires courts to                  determine       whether the\n      classification in  question                 is,   at       a   minimum,\n\n                                         84\n\f     rationally related to legitimate governmental goals.\n     In other words, the fit between the enactment and the\n     public purposes behind it need not be mathematically\n     precise.     As long as [the legislature] has a\n     reasonable basis for adopting the classification,\n     which can include “rational speculation unsupported by\n     evidence or empirical data,” the statute will pass\n     constitutional muster.     The rational basis standard\n     thus embodies an idea critical to the continuing\n     vitality of our democracy:       that courts are not\n     empowered to “sit as a superlegislature to judge the\n     wisdom   or    desirability   of   legislative  policy\n     determinations.”\n\nWilkins v. Gaddy, 734 F.3d 344, 347-48 (4th Cir. 2013) (emphasis\n\nadded) (citations omitted) (quoting FCC v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc.,\n\n508 U.S. 307, 315 (1993); City of New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.S.\n\n297, 303 (1976)).      Statutes subject to rational-basis review\n\n“bear[] a strong presumption of validity, and those attacking\n\nthe rationality of the legislative classification have the\n\nburden ‘to negative every conceivable basis which might support\n\n[them].’”   Beach Commc’ns, 508 U.S. at 314-15 (emphasis added)\n\n(citation omitted) (quoting Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts\n\nCo., 410 U.S. 356, 364 (1973)).\n\n     In   contending    that   there    is   a   rational   basis   for   its\n\nmarriage laws, Virginia has emphasized that children are born\n\nonly to one man and one woman and that marriage provides a\n\nfamily structure by which to nourish and raise those children.\n\nIt claims that a biological family is a more stable environment,\n\nand it renounces any interest in encouraging same-sex marriage.\n\nIt argues that the purpose of its marriage laws “is to channel\n\n                                   85\n\fthe presumptive procreative potential of man-woman relationships\n\ninto enduring marital unions so that if any children are born,\n\nthey   are   more       likely    to     be    raised      in     stable    family       units.”\n\n(Emphasis omitted).              Virginia highlights especially marriage’s\n\ntendency     to     promote       stability          in     the    event        of    unplanned\n\npregnancies, asserting that it has “a compelling interest in\n\naddressing the particular concerns associated with the birth of\n\nunplanned      children.      .    .     .         [C]hildren      born     from       unplanned\n\npregnancies where their mother and father are not married to\n\neach   other      are    at   significant           risk    of    being     raised       outside\n\nstable family units headed by their mother and father jointly.”\n\n       Virginia     states        that       its     justifications           for     promoting\n\ntraditional       marriage        also       explain       its    lack     of    interest    in\n\npromoting same-sex marriage.                    It maintains that a traditional\n\nmarriage       is       “exclusively           [an]        opposite-sex              institution\n\n. . . inextricably            linked          to     procreation           and        biological\n\nkinship,” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2718 (Alito, J., dissenting),\n\nand that same-sex marriage prioritizes the emotions and sexual\n\nattractions of the two partners without any necessary link to\n\nreproduction.       It asserts that it has no interest in “licensing\n\nadults’ love.”\n\n       The plaintiffs accept that family stability is a legitimate\n\nstate goal, but they argue that licensing same-sex relationships\n\nwill   not   burden       Virginia’s          achievement         of   that      goal.     They\n\n                                               86\n\fcontend that “there is simply no evidence or reason to believe\n\nthat     prohibiting           gay    men      and    lesbians         from      marrying    will\n\nincrease ‘responsible procreation’ among heterosexuals.”\n\n       But    this    argument         does     not    negate      any      of    the   rational\n\njustifications for Virginia’s legislation.                             States are permitted\n\nto    selectively         provide      benefits       to    only    certain         groups    when\n\nproviding those same benefits to other groups would not further\n\nthe State’s ultimate goals.                     See Johnson v. Robinson, 415 U.S.\n\n361, 383 (1974) (“When . . . the inclusion of one group promotes\n\na legitimate governmental purpose, and the addition of other\n\ngroups       would        not,       we     cannot         say     that       the       statute's\n\nclassification            of      beneficiaries            and     nonbeneficiaries            is\n\ninvidiously discriminatory”).                    Here, the Commonwealth’s goal of\n\nensuring that unplanned children are raised in stable homes is\n\nfurthered only by offering the benefits of marriage to opposite-\n\nsex    couples.           As    Virginia       correctly         asserts,        “the    relevant\n\ninquiry      here    is    not       whether     excluding        same-sex        couples    from\n\nmarriage     furthers          [Virginia’s]          interest     in    steering        man-woman\n\ncouples into marriage.”                 Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether\n\nalso    recognizing            same-sex     marriages       would       further      Virginia’s\n\ninterests.          With       regard     to    its    interest        in     ensuring      stable\n\nfamilies in the event of unplanned pregnancies, it would not.\n\n       The plaintiffs reply that even if this is so, such “line-\n\ndrawing” only makes sense if the resources at issue are scarce,\n\n                                                 87\n\fjustifying      the    State’s     limited         provision     of    those    resources.\n\nThey   argue    that    because      “[m]arriage          licenses . . . are         not   a\n\nremotely scarce commodity,” the line-drawing done by Virginia’s\n\nmarriage       laws     is       irrational.             But      this      fundamentally\n\nmisunderstands        the    nature      of    marriage         benefits.         When   the\n\nCommonwealth     grants      a    marriage,        it    does    not   simply     give   the\n\ncouple a piece of paper and a title.                            Rather, it provides a\n\nsubstantial subsidy to the married couple -- economic benefits\n\nthat, the plaintiffs repeatedly assert, are being denied them.\n\nFor example, married couples are permitted to file state income\n\ntaxes jointly, lowering their tax rates.                           See Va. Code Ann.\n\n§ 58.1-324.           Although     indirect,         such       benefits    are     clearly\n\nsubsidies that come at a cost to the Commonwealth.                             Virginia is\n\nwilling    to    provide         these   subsidies          because      they     encourage\n\nopposite-sex couples to marry, which tends to provide children\n\nfrom   unplanned       pregnancies        with       a   more     stable    environment.\n\nUnder Johnson, the Commonwealth is not obligated to similarly\n\nsubsidize same-sex marriages, since doing so could not possibly\n\nfurther its interest.             This is no different from the subsidies\n\nprovided in other cases where the Supreme Court has upheld line-\n\ndrawing, such as Medicare benefits, Matthews v. Diaz, 426 U.S.\n\n67, 83-84 (1976), or veterans’ educational benefits, Johnson,\n\n415 U.S. at 383.\n\n\n\n                                              88\n\f         As an additional argument, Virginia maintains that marriage\n\nis   a    “[c]omplex      social    institution[]”             with    a    “set    of    norms,\n\nrules, patterns, and expectations that powerfully (albeit often\n\nunconsciously)           affect        people’s          choices,            actions,        and\n\nperspectives.”            It   asserts       that    discarding             the    traditional\n\ndefinition of marriage will have far-reaching consequences that\n\ncannot easily be predicted, including “sever[ing] the inherent\n\nlink      between       procreation . . . and              marriage . . . [and]               in\n\nturn . . . powerfully             convey[ing]        that        marriage          exists     to\n\nadvance        adult    desires     rather        than    [to]        serv[e]       children’s\n\nneeds.”\n\n         The   plaintiffs      agree     that       changing          the     definition       of\n\nmarriage may have unforeseen social effects, but they argue that\n\nsuch      predictions      should      not    be     enough       to        save    Virginia’s\n\nmarriage laws because similar justifications were rejected in\n\nLoving.        The Loving Court, however, was not applying rational-\n\nbasis review.           See Loving, 388 U.S. at 11-12.                            We are on a\n\ndifferent        footing       here.           Under           rational-basis             review,\n\nlegislative         choices    “may     be    based       on     rational          speculation\n\nunsupported by evidence or empirical data.”                           Beach Commc’ns, 508\n\nU.S. at 315.           “Sound policymaking often requires legislators to\n\nforecast future events and to anticipate the likely impact of\n\nthese      events      based   on   deductions           and    inferences          for    which\n\ncomplete empirical support may be unavailable.”                               Turner Broad.\n\n                                             89\n\fSys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 665 (1994) (plurality opinion).\n\nAnd the legislature “is far better equipped than the judiciary”\n\nto make these evaluations and ultimately decide on a course of\n\naction based on its predictions.                   Id. at 665-66.          In enacting\n\nits     marriage     laws,       Virginia        predicted      that   changing         the\n\ndefinition of marriage would have a negative effect on children\n\nand on the family structure.               Although other States do not share\n\nthose    concerns,        such    evaluations       were       nonetheless      squarely\n\nwithin the province of the Commonwealth’s legislature and its\n\ncitizens, who voted to amend Virginia’s Constitution in 2006.\n\n       Virginia     has    undoubtedly      articulated         sufficient      rational\n\nbases for its marriage laws, and I would find that those bases\n\nconstitutionally justify the laws.                  Those laws are grounded on\n\nthe biological connection of men and women; the potential for\n\ntheir    having     children;       the    family     order      needed    in       raising\n\nchildren; and, on a larger scale, the political order resulting\n\nfrom    stable     family    units.        Moreover,       I   would   add      that   the\n\ntraditional marriage relationship encourages a family structure\n\nthat is intergenerational, giving children not only a structure\n\nin    which   to    be    raised    but     also    an   identity      and      a    strong\n\nrelational context.              The marriage of a man and a woman thus\n\nrationally promotes a correlation between biological order and\n\npolitical     order.             Because    Virginia’s          marriage     laws      are\n\n\n\n                                            90\n\frationally related to its legitimate purposes, they withstand\n\nrational-basis scrutiny under the Due Process Clause.\n\n\n                                        IV\n\n      The majority does not substantively address the plaintiffs’\n\nsecond    argument    --   that     Virginia’s      marriage    laws    invidiously\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, in violation of\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause -- since it finds that the laws\n\ninfringe on the plaintiffs’ fundamental right to marriage.                         But\n\nbecause I find no fundamental right is infringed by the laws, I\n\nalso address discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n      The Equal Protection Clause, which forbids any State from\n\n“deny[ing]    to     any   person    within    its    jurisdiction        the     equal\n\nprotection of the laws,” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, prohibits\n\ninvidious     discrimination        among     classes     of    persons.          Some\n\nclassifications -- such as those based on race, alienage, or\n\nnational origin -- are “so seldom relevant to the achievement of\n\nany   legitimate      state   interest       that     laws     grounded      in    such\n\nconsiderations are deemed to reflect prejudice and antipathy --\n\na view that those in the burdened class are not as worthy or\n\ndeserving as others.”         City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,\n\n473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).              Any laws based on such “suspect”\n\nclassifications are subject to strict scrutiny.                       See id.     In a\n\nsimilar     vein,    classifications        based    on      gender    are    “quasi-\n\n\n                                        91\n\fsuspect”      and      call    for     “intermediate       scrutiny”         because    they\n\n“frequently         bear[]      no   relation       to   ability        to    perform     or\n\ncontribute to society” and thus “generally provide[] no sensible\n\nground      for   differential         treatment.”         Id.   at     440-41     (quoting\n\nFrontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973) (plurality\n\nopinion)); see also Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 (1976).\n\nLaws   subject         to    intermediate       scrutiny    must      be     substantially\n\nrelated to an important government objective.                         See United States\n\nv. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996).\n\n       But when a regulation adversely affects members of a class\n\nthat     is    not      suspect      or   quasi-suspect,         the       regulation    is\n\n“presumed         to    be     valid      and    will      be    sustained         if    the\n\nclassification drawn by the statute is rationally related to a\n\nlegitimate state interest.”                City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440\n\n(emphasis added).             Moreover, the Supreme Court has made it clear\n\nthat\n\n       where individuals in the group affected by a law have\n       distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests\n       the State has the authority to implement, the courts\n       have been very reluctant, as they should be in our\n       federal system and with our respect for the separation\n       of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices\n       as to whether, how, and to what extent those interests\n       should be pursued.       In such cases, the Equal\n       Protection Clause requires only a rational means to\n       serve a legitimate end.\n\nId.    at     441-42        (emphasis     added).        This      is      based   on   the\n\nunderstanding that “equal protection of the laws must coexist\n\n\n                                            92\n\fwith the practical necessity that most legislation classifies\n\nfor    one    purpose      or    another,       with      resulting    disadvantage        to\n\nvarious groups or persons.”               Romer, 517 U.S. at 631.\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that Virginia’s marriage laws should\n\nbe subjected to some level of heightened scrutiny because they\n\ndiscriminate        on    the    basis    of     sexual     orientation.           Yet    they\n\nconcede that neither the Supreme Court nor the Fourth Circuit\n\nhas ever applied heightened scrutiny to a classification based\n\non sexual orientation.               They urge this court to do so for the\n\nfirst time.        Governing precedent, however, counsels otherwise.\n\n       In Romer v. Evans, the Supreme Court did not employ any\n\nheightened         level    of       scrutiny        in     evaluating        a     Colorado\n\nconstitutional           amendment       that       prohibited       state        and    local\n\ngovernments from enacting legislation that would allow persons\n\nto    claim    “any      minority     status,       quota    preferences,          protected\n\nstatus, or . . . discrimination” based on sexual orientation.\n\nRomer,       517    U.S.        at   624.            In     holding     the        amendment\n\nunconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, the Court\n\napplied rational-basis review.                  See id. at 631-33.\n\n       And the Supreme Court made no change as to the appropriate\n\nlevel of scrutiny in its more recent decision in Windsor, which\n\nheld Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional.\n\nThe    Court    was      presented       an    opportunity      to    alter       the    Romer\n\nstandard but did not do so.                   Although it did not state the level\n\n                                               93\n\fof scrutiny being applied, it did explicitly rely on rational-\n\nbasis cases like Romer and Department of Agriculture v. Moreno,\n\n413 U.S. 528 (1973).          See Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2693.               In his\n\ndissenting opinion in Windsor, Justice Scalia thus noted, “As\n\nnearly    as   I   can   tell,   the    Court    agrees     [that   rational-basis\n\nreview applies]; its opinion does not apply strict scrutiny, and\n\nits   central      propositions       are   taken   from    rational-basis    cases\n\nlike Moreno.”       Id. at 2706 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n\n      Finally,      we   have     concluded      that      rational-basis    review\n\napplies to classifications based on sexual orientation.                          See\n\nVeney v. Wyche, 293 F.3d 726, 731-32 (4th Cir. 2002).                    In Veney,\n\na prisoner filed a § 1983 action alleging that he had been\n\ndiscriminated       against     on    the   basis   of    sexual    preference   and\n\ngender.     Id. at 729-30.           We noted that the plaintiff “[did] not\n\nallege that he [was] a member of a suspect class.                       Rather, he\n\nclaim[ed] that he ha[d] been discriminated against on the basis\n\nof sexual preference and gender.                 Outside the prison context,\n\nthe former is subject to rational basis review, see Romer v.\n\nEvans, 517 U.S. 620, 631-32 (1996).”                     Id. at 731-32 (footnote\n\nomitted).\n\n      The vast majority of other courts of appeals have reached\n\nthe same conclusion.            See Cook v. Gates, 528 F.3d 42, 61 (1st\n\nCir. 2008) (“Romer nowhere suggested that the Court recognized a\n\nnew suspect class.

United States, 699 F.3d\n\n169,     180-85    (2d     Cir.    2012)        (finding    intermediate           scrutiny\n\nappropriate in assessing the constitutionality of Section 3 of\n\nthe Defense of Marriage Act).\n\n                                              96\n\f       Thus, following Supreme Court and Fourth Circuit precedent,\n\nI   would   hold    that   Virginia’s         marriage   laws    are   subject    to\n\nrational-basis review.           Applying that standard, I conclude that\n\nthere is a rational basis for the laws, as explained in Part\n\nIII, above.        At bottom, I agree with Justice Alito’s reasoning\n\nthat   “[i]n    asking     the    court    to    determine      that   [Virginia’s\n\nmarriage laws are] subject to and violate[] heightened scrutiny,\n\n[the plaintiffs] thus ask us to rule that the presence of two\n\nmembers of the opposite sex is as rationally related to marriage\n\nas white skin is to voting or a Y-chromosome is to the ability\n\nto administer an estate.            That is a striking request and one\n\nthat unelected judges should pause before granting.”                        Windsor,\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2717-18 (Alito, J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                          V\n\n       Whether to recognize same-sex marriage is an ongoing and\n\nhighly engaged political debate taking place across the Nation,\n\nand the States are divided on the issue.                 The majority of courts\n\nhave   struck   down     statutes    that      deny   recognition      of   same-sex\n\nmarriage, doing so almost exclusively on the idea that same-sex\n\nmarriage is encompassed by the fundamental right to marry that\n\nis protected by the Due Process Clause.                    While I express no\n\nviewpoint on the merits of the policy debate, I do strongly\n\ndisagree with the assertion that same-sex marriage is subject to\n\n\n                                          97\n\fthe same constitutional protections as the traditional right to\n\nmarry.\n\n      Because there is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage\n\nand there are rational reasons for not recognizing it, just as\n\nthere are rational reasons for recognizing it, I conclude that\n\nwe,   in   the   Third    Branch,   must     allow   the    States    to   enact\n\nlegislation on the subject in accordance with their political\n\nprocesses.       The   U.S.   Constitution    does   not,   in   my   judgment,\n\nrestrict the States’ policy choices on this issue.               If given the\n\nchoice, some States will surely recognize same-sex marriage and\n\nsome will surely not.         But that is, to be sure, the beauty of\n\nfederalism.\n\n      I would reverse the district court’s judgment and defer to\n\nVirginia’s political choice in defining marriage as only between\n\none man and one woman.\n\n\n\n\n                                     98\n\f",

The district court granted the couples’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment and enjoined Virginia from enforcing the laws.\n\nThis appeal followed.         Because we conclude that Virginia’s same-\n\nsex   marriage       bans   impermissibly      infringe        on    its    citizens’\n\nfundamental right to marry, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                         I.\n\n                                         A.\n\n      This case concerns a series of statutory and constitutional\n\nmechanisms that Virginia employed to prohibit legal recognition\n\nfor same-sex relationships in that state. 1               Virginia enacted the\n\n\n      1\n       Three other states in this Circuit have similar bans:\nNorth Carolina, N.C. Const. art. XIV, § 6; N.C. Gen. Stat.\n§§ 51-1, 51-1.2; South Carolina, S.C. Const. art. XVII, § 15;\nS.C. Code Ann. §§ 20-1-10, 20-1-15; and West Virginia, W. Va.\nCode § 48-2-603.    The Southern District of West Virginia has\nstayed a challenge to West Virginia’s statute pending our\nresolution of this appeal.     McGee v. Cole, No. 3:13-cv-24068\n(S.D. W. Va. June 10, 2014) (order directing stay).\n\n\n\n                                         20\n\ffirst of these laws in 1975:                 Virginia Code section 20-45.2,\n\nwhich provides that “marriage between persons of the same sex is\n\nprohibited.”         After the Supreme Court of Hawaii took steps to\n\nlegalize same-sex marriage in the mid-1990s, Virginia amended\n\nsection 20-45.2 to specify that “[a]ny marriage entered into by\n\npersons of the same sex in another state or jurisdiction shall\n\nbe void in all respects in Virginia and any contractual rights\n\ncreated by such marriage shall be void and unenforceable.”                        In\n\n2004, Virginia added civil unions and similar arrangements to\n\nthe    list     of     prohibited      same-sex    relationships        via      the\n\nAffirmation of Marriage Act.           See Va. Code Ann. § 20-45.3.\n\n       Virginia’s      efforts   to    ban    same-sex    marriage    and     other\n\nlegally      recognized    same-sex     relationships      culminated       in   the\n\nMarshall/Newman Amendment to the Virginia Constitution:\n\n       That only a union between one man and one woman may be\n       a marriage valid in or recognized by this Commonwealth\n       and its political subdivisions.\n\n       This Commonwealth and its political subdivisions shall\n       not   create   or   recognize  a   legal  status   for\n       relationships of unmarried individuals that intends to\n       approximate the design, qualities, significance, or\n       effects of marriage. Nor shall this Commonwealth or\n       its political subdivisions create or recognize another\n       union, partnership, or other legal status to which is\n       assigned the rights, benefits, obligations, qualities,\n       or effects of marriage.\n\nVa. Const. art. I, § 15-A.              The Virginia Constitution imposes\n\ntwo hurdles that a potential amendment must jump before becoming\n\nlaw:   the    General     Assembly    must   approve     the   amendment    in   two\n\n                                        21\n\fseparate legislative sessions, and the people must ratify it.\n\nVa. Const. art. XII, § 1.                    The General Assembly approved the\n\nMarshall/Newman Amendment in 2005 and 2006.                                In November 2006,\n\nVirginia’s voters ratified it by a vote of fifty-seven percent\n\nto    forty-three       percent.            In        the    aggregate,       Virginia    Code\n\nsections 20-45.2 and 20-45.3 and the Marshall/Newman Amendment\n\nprohibit same-sex marriage, ban other legally recognized same-\n\nsex     relationships,         and       render        same-sex      marriages       performed\n\nelsewhere legally meaningless under Virginia state law.\n\n\n\n                                                 B.\n\n      Same-sex couples Timothy B. Bostic and Tony C. London and\n\nCarol    Schall    and       Mary    Townley          (collectively,        the    Plaintiffs)\n\nbrought    this    lawsuit          to     challenge         the    constitutionality       of\n\nVirginia Code sections 20-45.2 and 20-45.3, the Marshall/Newman\n\nAmendment,       and    “any    other        Virginia         law    that     bars    same-sex\n\nmarriage    or    prohibits          the    State’s         recognition       of   otherwise-\n\nlawful      same-sex           marriages              from         other      jurisdictions”\n\n(collectively,         the    Virginia       Marriage         Laws).         The     Plaintiffs\n\nclaim that the “inability to marry or have their relationship\n\nrecognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia with the dignity and\n\nrespect accorded to married opposite-sex couples has caused them\n\nsignificant hardship . . . and severe humiliation, emotional\n\ndistress, pain, suffering, psychological harm, and stigma.”\n\n                                                 22\n\f       Bostic    and    London      have    been         in    a    long-term,       committed\n\nrelationship with each other since 1989 and have lived together\n\nfor more than twenty years.                 They “desire to marry each other\n\nunder the laws of the Commonwealth in order to publicly announce\n\ntheir    commitment      to     one    another        and      to     enjoy    the     rights,\n\nprivileges, and protections that the State confers on married\n\ncouples.”        On July 1, 2013, Bostic and London applied for a\n\nmarriage license from the Clerk for the Circuit Court for the\n\nCity of Norfolk.             The Clerk denied their application because\n\nthey are both men.\n\n       Schall and Townley are women who have been a couple since\n\n1985    and    have    lived   together         as   a    family      for     nearly      thirty\n\nyears.        They were lawfully married in California in 2008.                               In\n\n1998,    Townley      gave    birth    to   the      couple’s         daughter,      E.   S.-T.\n\nSchall    and    Townley      identify      a   host      of       consequences      of    their\n\ninability       to    marry    in     Virginia       and       Virginia’s       refusal      to\n\nrecognize their California marriage, including the following:\n\n  •    Schall could not visit Townley in the hospital for several\n\n       hours when Townley was admitted due to pregnancy-related\n\n       complications.\n\n  •    Schall cannot legally adopt E. S.-T., which forced her to\n\n       retain an attorney to petition for full joint legal and\n\n       physical custody.\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\f  •   Virginia will not list both Schall and Townley as E. S.-\n\n      T.’s parents on her birth certificate.\n\n  •   Until February 2013, Schall and Townley could not cover one\n\n      another    on    their     employer-provided            health       insurance.\n\n      Townley   has   been   able     to   cover     Schall    on    her   insurance\n\n      since then, but, unlike an opposite-sex spouse, Schall must\n\n      pay state income taxes on the benefits she receives.\n\n  •   Schall and Townley must pay state taxes on benefits paid\n\n      pursuant to employee benefits plans in the event of one of\n\n      their deaths.\n\n  •   Schall    and   Townley    cannot       file   joint     state   income    tax\n\n      returns, which has cost them thousands of dollars.\n\n      On July 18, 2013, Bostic and London sued former Governor\n\nRobert     F.   McDonnell,      former        Attorney     General     Kenneth    T.\n\nCuccinelli,     and   George     E.   Schaefer,       III,     in    his    official\n\ncapacity as the Clerk for the Circuit Court for the City of\n\nNorfolk.     The Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint on\n\nSeptember 3, 2013.      The First Amended Complaint added Schall and\n\nTownley    as   plaintiffs,     removed        McDonnell      and   Cuccinelli    as\n\ndefendants, and added Janet M. Rainey as a defendant in her\n\nofficial capacity as the State Registrar of Vital Records.                       The\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Virginia Marriage Laws are facially\n\ninvalid under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\fthe Fourteenth Amendment and that Schaefer and Rainey violated\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 by enforcing those laws.\n\n       The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The\n\nPlaintiffs also requested a permanent injunction in connection\n\nwith   their     motion     for    summary    judgment         and   moved,    in     the\n\nalternative, for a preliminary injunction in the event that the\n\ndistrict court denied their motion for summary judgment.                              The\n\ndistrict court granted a motion by Michèle McQuigg—the Prince\n\nWilliam County Clerk of Court—to intervene as a defendant on\n\nJanuary 21, 2014.           Two days later, new Attorney General Mark\n\nHerring—as       Rainey’s     counsel—submitted           a     formal     change     in\n\nposition   and     refused    to     defend   the    Virginia        Marriage       Laws,\n\nalthough Virginia continues to enforce them.                         McQuigg adopted\n\nRainey’s prior motion for summary judgment and the briefs in\n\nsupport of that motion.\n\n       The district court held that the Virginia Marriage Laws\n\nwere unconstitutional on February 14, 2014.

It therefore denied\n\nSchaefer’s       and   McQuigg’s      motions   for       summary        judgment     and\n\ngranted    the     Plaintiffs’      motion.         The       district    court     also\n\nenjoined       Virginia’s         employees—including           Rainey      and      her\n\nemployees—and Schaefer, McQuigg, and their officers, agents, and\n\nemployees from enforcing the Virginia Marriage Laws.

Id.\n\n       Rainey, Schaefer, and McQuigg timely appealed the district\n\ncourt’s decision.         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1291.      On   March   10,    2014,    we     allowed     the    plaintiffs    from\n\nHarris v.

Third, we determine which level\n\nof constitutional scrutiny applies here and test the Virginia\n\nMarriage Laws using the appropriate standard.                       For purposes of\n\nthis opinion, we adopt the terminology the district court used\n\nto describe the parties in this case.                     The Plaintiffs, Rainey,\n\nand    the   Harris     class    are   the      “Opponents”        of   the   Virginia\n\nMarriage Laws.

For the reasons we describe above,\n\nthis license denial constitutes an injury.                   Bostic and London\n\ncan trace this injury to Rainey due to her role in developing\n\nthe marriage license application form in compliance with the\n\nVirginia Marriage Laws, and the relief they seek would redress\n\ntheir injuries.       Bostic and London consequently have standing to\n\nsue Rainey.\n\n     Schall and Townley also possess standing to bring their\n\nclaims against Rainey.           They satisfy the injury requirement in\n\ntwo ways.        First, in equal protection cases—such as this case—\n\n“[w]hen    the    government     erects    a    barrier    that   makes    it    more\n\ndifficult for members of one group to obtain a benefit than it\n\nis for members of another group, . . . .

The Virginia Marriage Laws erect such a barrier,\n\nwhich prevents same-sex couples from obtaining the emotional,\n\nsocial, and financial benefits that opposite-sex couples realize\n\n                                          31\n\fupon marriage.       Second, Schall and Townley allege that they have\n\nsuffered     stigmatic    injuries      due    to    their     inability       to   get\n\nmarried in Virginia and Virginia’s refusal to recognize their\n\nCalifornia        marriage.         Stigmatic         injury        stemming        from\n\ndiscriminatory      treatment      is   sufficient        to   satisfy     standing’s\n\ninjury requirement if the plaintiff identifies “some concrete\n\ninterest   with     respect   to    which     [he    or    she]    [is]    personally\n\nsubject to discriminatory treatment” and “[t]hat interest . . .\n\nindependently satisf[ies] the causation requirement of standing\n\ndoctrine.”        Allen, 468 U.S. at 757 n.22, abrogated on other\n\ngrounds by Lexmark Int’l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, 134\n\nS.   Ct.   1377    (2014).      Schall      and     Townley     point     to   several\n\nconcrete ways in which the Virginia Marriage Laws have resulted\n\nin   discriminatory      treatment.       For     example,        they    allege    that\n\ntheir marital status has hindered Schall from visiting Townley\n\nin the hospital, prevented Schall from adopting E. S.-T., 4 and\n\nsubjected Schall and Townley to tax burdens from which married\n\nopposite-sex couples are exempt.                  Because Schall and Townley\n\nhighlight specific, concrete instances of discrimination rather\n\n\n\n      4\n       Virginia does not explicitly prohibit same-sex couples\nfrom adopting children.     The Virginia Marriage Laws impose a\nfunctional ban on adoption by same-sex couples because the\nVirginia   Code  allows   only   married  couples  or  unmarried\nindividuals to adopt children. Va. Code Ann. § 63.2-1232(A)(6).\n\n\n\n                                         32\n\fthan making abstract allegations, their stigmatic injuries are\n\nlegally cognizable.\n\n     Schall    and    Townley’s       injuries      are   traceable     to   Rainey’s\n\nenforcement of the Virginia Marriage Laws.                      Because declaring\n\nthe Virginia Marriage Laws unconstitutional and enjoining their\n\nenforcement would redress Schall and Townley’s injuries, they\n\nsatisfy standing doctrine’s three requirements with respect to\n\nRainey.     In sum, each of the Plaintiffs has standing as to at\n\nleast one defendant.\n\n\n\n                                         III.\n\n     Having     resolved       the     threshold      issue     of     whether     the\n\nPlaintiffs have standing to sue Schaefer and Rainey, we now turn\n\nto the merits of the Opponents’ Fourteenth Amendment arguments.\n\nWe begin with the issue of whether the Supreme Court’s summary\n\ndismissal in Baker v. Nelson settles this case.                       Baker came to\n\nthe Supreme Court as an appeal from a Minnesota Supreme Court\n\ndecision,     which    held    that    a    state     statute    that    the     court\n\ninterpreted     to    bar     same-sex     marriages      did   not    violate    the\n\nFourteenth Amendment’s Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses.\n\nBaker v.

The Windsor Court based its\n\ndecision     to    invalidate         section       3     of        DOMA     on   the        Fifth\n\nAmendment’s       Due    Process      Clause.

They strongly disagree, however, regarding\n\nwhether that right encompasses the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nThe Opponents argue that the fundamental right to marry belongs\n\nto the individual, who enjoys the right to marry the person of\n\nhis or her choice.             By contrast, the Proponents point out that,\n\ntraditionally, states have sanctioned only man-woman marriages.\n\nThey contend that, in light of this history, the right to marry\n\ndoes not include a right to same-sex marriage.\n\n       Relying on Washington v. Glucksberg, the Proponents aver\n\nthat   the    district         court    erred      by    not    requiring       “a    careful\n\ndescription of the asserted fundamental liberty interest,” 521\n\nU.S.   at    721     (internal        quotation      marks      omitted),       which    they\n\ncharacterize as the right to “marriage to another person of the\n\nsame sex,” not the right to marry.                       In Glucksberg, the Supreme\n\nCourt described the right at issue as “a right to commit suicide\n\n                                              40\n\fwith another’s assistance.”           Id. at 724.       The Court declined to\n\ncategorize this right as a new fundamental right because it was\n\nnot, “objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and\n\ntradition.”        See id. at 720-21 (quoting Moore v.

The Proponents urge us to reject the right to same-\n\nsex marriage for the same reason.\n\n     We do not dispute that states have refused to permit same-\n\nsex marriages for most of our country’s history.                    However, this\n\nfact is irrelevant in this case because Glucksberg’s analysis\n\napplies    only     when   courts    consider      whether   to   recognize    new\n\nfundamental rights.         See id. at 720, 727 & n.19 (identifying the\n\nabove     process     as   a   way    of     “expand[ing]     the    concept    of\n\nsubstantive due process” beyond established fundamental rights,\n\nsuch as the right to marry (quoting Collins v.

Because we conclude that the fundamental right to\n\nmarry encompasses the right to same-sex marriage, Glucksberg’s\n\nanalysis is inapplicable here.\n\n     Over the decades, the Supreme Court has demonstrated that\n\nthe right to marry is an expansive liberty interest that may\n\nstretch to accommodate changing societal norms.                     Perhaps most\n\nnotably, in Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court invalidated a\n\nVirginia    law     that   prohibited      white   individuals    from   marrying\n\n                                        41\n\findividuals of other races.                388 U.S. at 4.             The Court explained\n\nthat “[t]he freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of\n\nthe vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of\n\nhappiness by free men” and that no valid basis justified the\n\nVirginia     law’s     infringement           of       that     right.         Id.     at    12.\n\nSubsequently,        in       Zablocki      v.        Redhail,       the    Supreme         Court\n\nconsidered    the     constitutionality               of   a   Wisconsin       statute       that\n\nrequired people obligated to pay child support to obtain a court\n\norder granting permission to marry before they could receive a\n\nmarriage    license.           434     U.S.      at    375,     383-84.        The     statute\n\nspecified     that        a    court      should        grant        permission       only    to\n\napplicants who proved that they had complied with their child\n\nsupport obligations and demonstrated that their children were\n\nnot likely to become “public charges.”                           Id. at 375 (internal\n\nquotation    marks        omitted).         The       Court    held     that   the     statute\n\nimpermissibly infringed on the right to marry.                             See id. at 390-\n\n91.   Finally, in Turner v. Safley, the Court determined that a\n\nMissouri    regulation         that       generally        prohibited      prison      inmates\n\nfrom marrying was an unconstitutional breach of the right to\n\nmarry.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 82, 94-99 (1987).\n\n      These cases do not define the rights in question as “the\n\nright to interracial marriage,” “the right of people owing child\n\nsupport to marry,” and “the right of prison inmates to marry.”\n\nInstead,    they     speak      of    a    broad      right     to    marry    that    is     not\n\n                                              42\n\fcircumscribed based on the characteristics of the individuals\n\nseeking       to    exercise          that     right.             The     Supreme          Court’s\n\nunwillingness        to    constrain         the        right     to     marry      to    certain\n\nsubspecies of marriage meshes with its conclusion that the right\n\nto marry is a matter of “freedom of choice,” Zablocki, 434 U.S.\n\nat 387, that “resides with the individual,” Loving, 388 U.S. at\n\n12.     If courts limited the right to marry to certain couplings,\n\nthey    would      effectively         create       a    list     of     legally         preferred\n\nspouses, rendering the choice of whom to marry a hollow choice\n\nindeed.\n\n       The Proponents point out that Loving, Zablocki, and Turner\n\neach involved opposite-sex couples.                       They contend that, because\n\nthe     couples     in     those       cases        chose       to     enter     opposite-sex\n\nmarriages, we cannot use them to conclude that the Supreme Court\n\nwould grant the same level of constitutional protection to the\n\nchoice to marry a person of the same sex.                              However, the Supreme\n\nCourt’s decisions in Lawrence and Windsor suggest otherwise.                                    In\n\nLawrence, the Court expressly refused to narrowly define the\n\nright    at    issue      as    the    right       of    “homosexuals          to    engage    in\n\nsodomy,” concluding that doing so would constitute a “failure to\n\nappreciate the extent of the liberty at stake.”                                  539 U.S. at\n\n566-67.       Just as it has done in the right-to-marry arena, the\n\nCourt identified the right at issue in Lawrence as a matter of\n\nchoice,    explaining          that    gay   and        lesbian      individuals—like          all\n\n                                               43\n\fpeople—enjoy         the     right    to     make       decisions        regarding         their\n\npersonal relationships.               Id. at 567.                 As we note above, the\n\nCourt reiterated this theme in Windsor, in which it based its\n\nconclusion that section 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional, in part,\n\non     that    provision’s         disrespect       for      the     “moral       and     sexual\n\nchoices” that accompany a same-sex couple’s decision to marry.\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2694.                 Lawrence and Windsor indicate that the\n\nchoices       that   individuals        make       in     the      context       of     same-sex\n\nrelationships enjoy the same constitutional protection as the\n\nchoices accompanying opposite-sex relationships.                                 We therefore\n\nhave no reason to suspect that the Supreme Court would accord\n\nthe choice to marry someone of the same sex any less respect\n\nthan the choice to marry an opposite-sex individual who is of a\n\ndifferent       race,        owes     child        support,         or     is     imprisoned.\n\nAccordingly,         we      decline        the      Proponents’           invitation          to\n\ncharacterize the right at issue in this case as the right to\n\nsame-sex marriage rather than simply the right to marry.\n\n       Of course, “[b]y reaffirming the fundamental character of\n\nthe right to marry, we do not mean to suggest that every state\n\nregulation      which       relates    in   any     way      to    the   incidents        of   or\n\nprerequisites         for     marriage      must        be    subjected          to     rigorous\n\nscrutiny.”       Zablocki, 434 U.S. at 386.                   Strict scrutiny applies\n\nonly    when    laws       “significantly         interfere”        with     a    fundamental\n\nright.         See    id.     at    386-87.

The Proponents 7 contend that\n\nfive compelling interests undergird the Virginia Marriage Laws:\n\n(1) Virginia’s federalism-based interest in maintaining control\n\nover    the    definition        of    marriage        within     its    borders,     (2)    the\n\nhistory and tradition of opposite-sex marriage, (3) protecting\n\nthe     institution         of     marriage,           (4)      encouraging       responsible\n\n       7\n       Although some of these arguments appear only in McQuigg’s\nbriefs, we attribute them to the Proponents because Schaefer\n“reserved the right to adopt and incorporate in whole or in\npart” McQuigg’s discussion of the rationales underlying the\nVirginia Marriage Laws.\n\n\n\n                                                  45\n\fprocreation,         and    (5)      promoting     the     optimal       childrearing\n\nenvironment.      We discuss each of these interests in turn.\n\n\n\n                                    1.     Federalism\n\n       The Constitution does not grant the federal government any\n\nauthority      over    domestic      relations    matters,      such    as   marriage.\n\nAccordingly,      throughout         our    country’s     history,       states    have\n\nenjoyed the freedom to define and regulate marriage as they see\n\nfit.       See Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2691-92.                 States’ control over\n\nmarriage      laws     within     their      borders     has    resulted     in    some\n\nvariation      among       states’       requirements.         For     example,    West\n\nVirginia      prohibits     first     cousins     from   marrying,      W.   Va.   Code\n\n§ 48-2-302, but the remaining states in this Circuit allow first\n\ncousin marriage, see Md. Code Ann., Fam. Law § 2-202; N.C. Gen.\n\nStat. § 51-3; S.C. Code Ann. § 20-1-10; Va. Code Ann. § 20-38.1.\n\nStates’ power to define and regulate marriage also accounts for\n\ntheir differing treatment of same-sex couples.\n\n       The Windsor decision rested in part on the Supreme Court’s\n\nrespect for states’ supremacy in the domestic relations sphere. 8\n\n\n       8\n        In Windsor, the Court did not label the type of\nconstitutional scrutiny it applied, leaving us unsure how the\nCourt would fit its federalism discussion within a traditional\nheightened scrutiny or rational basis analysis.     The lower\ncourts have taken differing approaches, with some discussing\nWindsor and federalism as a threshold matter, see, e.g., Wolf,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2558444</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8-12; Bishop v. United States ex rel.\n\n\n                                             46\n\fThe Court recognized that section 3 of DOMA upset the status quo\n\nby robbing states of their ability to define marriage.                          Although\n\nstates could legalize same-sex marriage, they could not ensure\n\nthat the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage would\n\nbe uniform within their borders.                      See Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at\n\n2692.       However, the Court did not lament that section 3 had\n\nusurped states’ authority over marriage due to its desire to\n\nsafeguard federalism.            Id. (“[T]he State’s power in defining the\n\nmarital     relation      is   of    central        relevance    in   this   case   quite\n\napart from the principles of federalism.”).                       Its concern sprung\n\nfrom section        3’s   creation        of    two   classes    of   married    couples\n\nwithin states that had legalized same-sex marriage:                           opposite-\n\nsex couples, whose marriages the federal government recognized,\n\nand    same-sex     couples,        whose      marriages   the    federal    government\n\nignored.      Id.    The resulting injury to same-sex couples served\n\nas    the   foundation     for      the     Court’s    conclusion     that   section    3\n\nviolated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.

In\n\nSchuette,     the   Court     refused        to     strike      down    a    voter-approved\n\nstate constitutional amendment that barred public universities\n\nin Michigan from using race-based preferences as part of their\n\nadmissions processes.

Instead, the Court dwelled\n\non the need to respect the voters’ policy choice, concluding\n\nthat “[i]t is demeaning to the democratic process to presume\n\nthat the voters are not capable of deciding an issue of this\n\nsensitivity on decent and rational grounds” and the judiciary’s\n\nrole was not to “disempower the voters from choosing which path\n\nto follow.”      Id. at 1635-38.\n\n     The      Proponents    emphasize   that    Virginia’s   voters   approved\n\nthe Marshall/Newman Amendment.               Like the Michigan amendment at\n\nissue    in     Schuette,    the   Marshall/Newman       Amendment    is   the\n\ncodification of Virginians’ policy choice in a legal arena that\n\nis fraught with intense social and political debate.              Americans’\n\nability to speak with their votes is essential to our democracy.\n\nBut the people’s will is not an independent compelling interest\n\nthat warrants depriving same-sex couples of their fundamental\n\nright to marry.\n\n     The very purpose of a Bill of Rights 9 was to withdraw\n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political\n     9\n       Of course, the Fourteenth Amendment is not part of the\nBill of Rights.

The Proponents suggest\n\nthat legalizing same-sex marriage will sever the link between\n\nmarriage and procreation:            they argue that, if same-sex couples—\n\nwho cannot procreate naturally—are allowed to marry, the state\n\nwill sanction the idea that marriage is a vehicle for adults’\n\nemotional fulfillment, not simply a framework for parenthood.\n\nAccording to the Proponents, if adults are the focal point of\n\n                                           51\n\fmarriage, “then no logical grounds reinforce stabilizing norms\n\nlike sexual exclusivity, permanence, and monogamy,” which exist\n\nto benefit children.\n\n      We   recognize          that,    in   some    cases,      we    owe    “substantial\n\ndeference to the predictive judgments” of the Virginia General\n\nAssembly,    for       whom    the    Proponents     purport     to    speak.

FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118097\"><a href=\"/opinion/118097/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (1997).                                 However,\n\neven if we view the Proponents’ theories through rose-colored\n\nglasses,     we       conclude       that   they    are   unfounded         for     two    key\n\nreasons.      First,          the    Supreme     Court    rejected      the       view    that\n\nmarriage is about only procreation in Griswold v. Connecticut,\n\nin which it upheld married couples’ right not to procreate and\n\narticulated       a    view    of     marriage     that   has   nothing       to    do    with\n\nchildren:\n\n      Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse,\n      hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of\n      being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way\n      of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not\n      political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial\n      or social projects. Yet it is an association for as\n      noble a purpose as any involved in our prior\n      decisions.\n\n381   U.S.    at       485-86;       see    also    Turner,     482    U.S.        at     95-96\n\n(describing       many    non-procreative          purposes     of    marriage).            The\n\nfact that marriage’s stabilizing norms have endured in the five\n\ndecades since the Supreme Court made this pronouncement weakens\n\n\n\n\n                                              52\n\fthe argument that couples remain in monogamous marriages only\n\nfor the sake of their offspring.\n\n       Second, the primary support that the Proponents offer for\n\ntheir theory is the legacy of a wholly unrelated legal change to\n\nmarriage:           no-fault    divorce.        Although      no-fault   divorce\n\ncertainly altered the realities of married life by making it\n\neasier for couples to end their relationships, we have no reason\n\nto think that legalizing same-sex marriage will have a similar\n\ndestabilizing effect.          In fact, it is more logical to think that\n\nsame-sex couples want access to marriage so that they can take\n\nadvantage      of     its      hallmarks,      including     faithfulness    and\n\npermanence, and that allowing loving, committed same-sex couples\n\nto   marry     and    recognizing    their     out-of-state     marriages   will\n\nstrengthen the institution of marriage.                We therefore reject the\n\nProponents’ concerns.\n\n\n\n                         4.    Responsible Procreation\n\n       Next,   the    Proponents    contend     that   the   Virginia    Marriage\n\nLaws’ differentiation between opposite-sex and same-sex couples\n\nstems from the fact that unintended pregnancies cannot result\n\nfrom    same-sex      unions.        By     sanctioning      only   opposite-sex\n\nmarriages, the Virginia Marriage Laws “provid[e] stability to\n\nthe types of relationships that result in unplanned pregnancies,\n\nthereby   avoiding      or     diminishing     the   negative   outcomes    often\n\n                                          53\n\fassociated    with    unintended       children.”           The    Proponents      allege\n\nthat children born to unwed parents face a “significant risk” of\n\nbeing raised in unstable families, which is harmful to their\n\ndevelopment.        Virginia, “of course, has a duty of the highest\n\norder to protect the interests of minor children, particularly\n\nthose of tender years.”              Palmore v. Sidoti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111160\"><a href=\"/opinion/111160/palmore-v-sidoti/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 433\n\n(1984).        However,        the     Virginia       Marriage       Laws     are     not\n\nappropriately tailored to further this interest.\n\n        If Virginia sought to ensure responsible procreation via\n\nthe      Virginia      Marriage        Laws,        the     laws      are     woefully\n\nunderinclusive.        Same-sex couples are not the only category of\n\ncouples     who     cannot    reproduce          accidentally.         For    example,\n\nopposite-sex      couples     cannot     procreate        unintentionally       if   they\n\ninclude a post-menopausal woman or an individual with a medical\n\ncondition that prevents unassisted conception.\n\n      The Proponents attempt to downplay the similarity between\n\nsame-sex    couples    and     infertile         opposite-sex      couples    in     three\n\nways.      First,    they    point    out    that    sterile       individuals       could\n\nremedy their fertility through future medical advances.                               This\n\npotentiality,       however,    does     not      explain    why    Virginia       should\n\ntreat    same-sex    and     infertile      opposite-sex      couples       differently\n\nduring the course of the latter group’s infertility.                            Second,\n\nthe Proponents posit that, even if one member of a man-woman\n\ncouple is sterile, the other member may not be.                         They suggest\n\n                                            54\n\fthat,     without        marriage’s          monogamy      mandate,        this      fertile\n\nindividual is more likely to have an unintended child with a\n\nthird party.          They contend that, due to this possibility, even\n\nopposite-sex      couples        who     cannot      procreate      need     marriage       to\n\nchannel    their       procreative          activity    in    a    way     that    same-sex\n\ncouples    do     not.          The      Proponents’         argument      assumes       that\n\nindividuals      in    same-sex       relationships        never    have     opposite-sex\n\nsexual    partners,       which    is       simply   not     the   case.       Third,      the\n\nProponents       imply     that,       by    marrying,       infertile       opposite-sex\n\ncouples    set     a     positive       example      for     couples     who      can     have\n\nunintended children, thereby encouraging them to marry.                              We see\n\nno reason why committed same-sex couples cannot serve as similar\n\nrole models.           We therefore reject the Proponents’ attempts to\n\ndifferentiate         same-sex     couples      from    other      couples     who      cannot\n\nprocreate accidentally.               Because same-sex couples and infertile\n\nopposite-sex          couples      are       similarly        situated,        the      Equal\n\nProtection       Clause     counsels          against      treating        these        groups\n\ndifferently.       See City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439 (explaining\n\nthat the Equal Protection Clause “is essentially a direction\n\nthat all persons similarly situated should be treated alike”).\n\n     Due to the Virginia Marriage Laws’ underinclusivity, this\n\ncase resembles City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc.\n\nIn City of Cleburne, the Supreme Court struck down a city law\n\nthat required group homes for the intellectually disabled to\n\n                                              55\n\fobtain a special use permit.                   Id. at 447-50.             The city did not\n\nimpose       the    same    requirement        on    similar    structures,          such   as\n\napartment complexes and nursing homes.                      Id. at 447.          The Court\n\ndetermined         that    the   permit      requirement       was    so    underinclusive\n\nthat the city’s motivation must have “rest[ed] on an irrational\n\nprejudice,” rendering the law unconstitutional.                            Id. at 450.       In\n\nlight of the Virginia Marriage Laws’ extreme underinclusivity,\n\nwe are forced to draw the same conclusion in this case.\n\n       The    Proponents’        responsible         procreation          argument   falters\n\nfor another reason as well.                     Strict scrutiny requires that a\n\nstate’s means further its compelling interest.                              See Shaw, 517\n\nU.S.    at    915    (“Although        we    have    not   always         provided   precise\n\nguidance on how closely the means . . . must serve the end (the\n\njustification or compelling interest), we have always expected\n\nthat the legislative action would substantially address, if not\n\nachieve, the avowed purpose.”).                      Prohibiting same-sex couples\n\nfrom marrying and ignoring their out-of-state marriages does not\n\nserve    Virginia’s         goal       of    preventing     out-of-wedlock           births.\n\nAlthough      same-sex      couples         cannot   procreate       accidentally,       they\n\ncan and do have children via other methods.                               According to an\n\namicus brief filed by Dr. Gary J. Gates, as of the 2010 U.S.\n\nCensus, more than 2500 same-sex couples were raising more than\n\n4000    children      under      the    age     of   eighteen        in    Virginia.        The\n\n\n\n                                               56\n\fVirginia Marriage Laws therefore increase the number of children\n\nraised by unmarried parents.\n\n        The    Proponents       acknowledge          that       same-sex       couples       become\n\nparents.       They contend, however, that the state has no interest\n\nin   channeling         same-sex        couples’       procreative         activities          into\n\nmarriage      because        same-sex      couples        “bring    children          into    their\n\nrelationship[s] only through intentional choice and pre-planned\n\naction.”        Accordingly,            “[t]hose      couples       neither      advance        nor\n\nthreaten       society’s       public       purpose         for     marriage”—stabilizing\n\nparental relationships for the benefit of children—“in the same\n\nmanner, or to the same degree, that sexual relationships between\n\nmen and women do.”\n\n     In       support    of    this      argument,         the    Proponents          invoke    the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Johnson v. Robison, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108980\"><a href=\"/opinion/108980/johnson-v-robison/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1974).       Johnson concerned educational benefits that the federal\n\ngovernment granted to military veterans who served on active\n\nduty.     Id. at 363.              The government provided these benefits to\n\nencourage enlistment and make military service more palatable to\n\nexisting       servicemembers.             Id.       at    382-83.         A    conscientious\n\nobjector—who       refused         to   serve    in       the    military       for    religious\n\nreasons—brought          suit,       contending           that    the   government            acted\n\nunconstitutionally            by    granting         benefits      to   veterans        but    not\n\nconscientious objectors.                 Id. at 363-64.

Because     offering\n\neducational         benefits       to     conscientious             objectors         would     not\n\nincentivize         military      service,       the    federal           government’s        line-\n\ndrawing was constitutional.                    Johnson, 415 U.S. at 382-83.                     The\n\nProponents claim that treating opposite-sex couples differently\n\nfrom    same-sex       couples      is    equally       justified           because     the    two\n\ngroups       are     not    similarly       situated          with        respect      to     their\n\nprocreative potential.\n\n       Johnson applied rational basis review, id. at 374-75, so we\n\nstrongly       doubt       its     applicability         to         our     strict      scrutiny\n\nanalysis.          In any event, we can easily distinguish Johnson from\n\nthe instant case.               In Johnson, offering educational benefits to\n\nveterans who served on active duty promoted the government’s\n\ngoal    of    making       military      service       more    attractive.             Extending\n\nthose     benefits         to    conscientious         objectors,           whose      religious\n\nbeliefs       precluded         military       service,        did        not   further       that\n\nobjective.           By     contrast,      a    stable        marital       relationship        is\n\nattractive          regardless       of    a     couple’s           procreative         ability.\n\nAllowing infertile opposite-sex couples to marry does nothing to\n\nfurther the government’s goal of channeling procreative conduct\n\ninto marriage.             Thus, excluding same-sex couples from marriage\n\n                                                58\n\fdue to their inability to have unintended children makes little\n\nsense.      Johnson therefore does not alter our conclusion that\n\nbarring same-sex couples’ access to marriage does nothing to\n\nfurther Virginia’s interest in responsible procreation.\n\n\n\n                               5.    Optimal Childrearing\n\n       We    now     shift      to     discussing            the     merit     of        the     final\n\ncompelling         interest         that    the       Proponents        invoke:                optimal\n\nchildrearing.            The Proponents aver that “children develop best\n\nwhen   reared       by    their      married      biological         parents        in    a     stable\n\nfamily      unit.”         They      dwell       on     the    importance           of     “gender-\n\ndifferentiated           parenting”        and    argue      that     sanctioning          same-sex\n\nmarriage will deprive children of the benefit of being raised by\n\na mother and a father, who have “distinct parenting styles.”                                       In\n\nessence, the Proponents argue that the Virginia Marriage Laws\n\nsafeguard children by preventing same-sex couples from marrying\n\nand starting inferior families.\n\n       The Opponents and their amici cast serious doubt on the\n\naccuracy of the Proponents’ contentions.

The     Proponents’      statements\n\nregarding same-sex couples’ parenting ability certainly qualify\n\nas   overbroad        generalizations.             Second,    as    we    explain     above,\n\nstrict scrutiny requires congruity between a law’s means and its\n\nend.     This congruity is absent here.                      There is absolutely no\n\nreason     to    suspect       that     prohibiting          same-sex      couples     from\n\nmarrying and refusing to recognize their out-of-state marriages\n\nwill cause same-sex couples to raise fewer children or impel\n\nmarried    opposite-sex         couples       to    raise     more       children.      The\n\nVirginia       Marriage    Laws       therefore      do     not    further     Virginia’s\n\ninterest in channeling children into optimal families, even if\n\n\n\n                                              61\n\fwe were to accept the dubious proposition that same-sex couples\n\nare less capable parents.\n\n       Because the Proponents’ arguments are based on overbroad\n\ngeneralizations about same-sex parents, and because there is no\n\nlink    between      banning      same-sex     marriage     and   promoting    optimal\n\nchildrearing,        this   aim     cannot     support      the   Virginia    Marriage\n\nLaws.       All of the Proponents’ justifications for the Virginia\n\nMarriage Laws therefore fail, and the laws cannot survive strict\n\nscrutiny.\n\n\n\n                                             V.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the Virginia\n\nMarriage      Laws      violate    the   Due      Process   and   Equal    Protection\n\nClauses      of   the    Fourteenth      Amendment    to    the   extent     that   they\n\nprevent      same-sex     couples     from     marrying     and   prohibit    Virginia\n\nfrom        recognizing      same-sex          couples’      lawful    out-of-state\n\nmarriages.        We therefore affirm the district court’s grant of\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and its decision to\n\nenjoin enforcement of the Virginia Marriage Laws. 10\n\n       10\n        Because we are able to resolve the merits of the\nOpponents’ claims, we need not consider their alternative\nrequest for a preliminary injunction.       We assume that the\ndistrict court’s decision to enjoin enforcement of the Virginia\nMarriage Laws encompassed a permanent injunction, which the\nPlaintiffs requested in connection with their motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n\n                                             62\n\f     We   recognize    that      same-sex     marriage   makes    some    people\n\ndeeply uncomfortable.            However, inertia and apprehension are\n\nnot legitimate bases for denying same-sex couples due process\n\nand equal protection of the laws.             Civil marriage is one of the\n\ncornerstones    of   our   way   of   life.     It   allows   individuals     to\n\ncelebrate and publicly declare their intentions to form lifelong\n\npartnerships,        which        provide        unparalleled        intimacy,\n\ncompanionship, emotional support, and security.                  The choice of\n\nwhether and whom to marry is an intensely personal decision that\n\nalters the course of an individual’s life.                 Denying same-sex\n\ncouples this choice prohibits them from participating fully in\n\nour society, which is precisely the type of segregation that the\n\nFourteenth Amendment cannot countenance.\n\n                                                                         AFFIRMED\n\n\n\n\n                                       63\n\fNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n       To be clear, this case is not about whether courts favor or\n\ndisfavor      same-sex         marriage,         or    whether         States       recognizing      or\n\ndeclining to recognize same-sex marriage have made good policy\n\ndecisions.         It is much narrower.                 It is about whether a State’s\n\ndecision       not       to     recognize        same-sex             marriage       violates       the\n\nFourteenth         Amendment         of    the       U.S.    Constitution.                Thus,     the\n\njudicial       response         must      be    limited          to    an    analysis          applying\n\nestablished constitutional principles.\n\n       The    Commonwealth           of    Virginia         has       always       recognized      that\n\n“marriage” is based on the “mutual agreement of a man and a\n\nwoman to marry each other,” Burke v.

May 20,\n\n2014).    This is indeed a recent phenomenon.\n\n     Virginia only recognizes marriage as between one man and\n\none woman, and, like a majority of States, it has codified this\n\nview.      See   Va.   Code   Ann.   §    20-45.2   (prohibiting   same-sex\n\nmarriage and declining to recognize same-sex marriages conducted\n\nin other States); id. § 20-45.3 (prohibiting civil unions and\n\nsimilar arrangements between persons of the same sex).             The bill\n\noriginally proposing what would become § 20-45.3 noted the basis\n\nfor Virginia’s legislative decision:\n\n     [H]uman marriage is a consummated two in one communion\n     of male and female persons made possible by sexual\n     differences which are reproductive in type, whether or\n     not they are reproductive in effect or motivation.\n     This present relationship recognizes the equality of\n     male and female persons, and antedates recorded\n     history.\n\nAffirmation of Marriage Act, H.D. 751, 2004 Gen. Assembly, Reg.\n\nSess. (Va. 2004).       The bill predicted that the recognition of\n\nsame-sex marriage would “radically transform the institution of\n\nmarriage with serious and harmful consequences to the social\n\norder.”    Id.   Virginia also amended its Constitution in 2006 to\n\n                                     70\n\fdefine marriage as only between “one man and one woman” and to\n\nprohibit    “a     legal    status       for   relationships        of     unmarried\n\nindividuals that intends to approximate the design, qualities,\n\nsignificance, or effects of marriage.”                Va. Const. art. I, § 15-\n\nA.   The    plaintiffs      commenced      this     action    to    challenge    the\n\nconstitutionality of Virginia’s marriage laws.\n\n     Plaintiffs Timothy B. Bostic and Tony C. London have lived\n\nin a committed same-sex relationship since 1989 and have lived\n\nin Virginia since 1991.         The two desired to marry in Virginia,\n\nand on July 1, 2013, when they applied for a marriage license at\n\nthe office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court for the City of\n\nNorfolk,    they   were    denied    a    license     and    told   that    same-sex\n\ncouples are ineligible to marry in Virginia.                  In their complaint\n\nchallenging Virginia’s marriage laws, they alleged that their\n\ninability to marry has disadvantaged them in both economic and\n\npersonal ways -- it has prevented them from filing joint tax\n\nreturns, kept them from sharing health insurance on a tax-free\n\nbasis, and signaled that they are “less than” other couples in\n\nVirginia.\n\n     Plaintiffs     Carol    Schall      and   Mary    Townley      likewise    have\n\nlived in a committed same-sex relationship since 1985 and have\n\nlived in Virginia throughout their 29-year relationship.                         In\n\n1998, Townley gave birth to a daughter, E.S.-T., whom Schall and\n\nTownley have raised together, and in 2008, the two traveled to\n\n                                         71\n\fCalifornia where they were lawfully married.                             They alleged in\n\ntheir complaint that because Virginia does not recognize their\n\nmarriage       as    valid,     they    have    been       injured      in    several      ways.\n\nSchall    is    unable     to    legally       adopt      E.S.-T.,      and    the    two    are\n\nunable to share health insurance on a tax-free basis.                                 The two\n\nalso claimed that they and E.S.-T. have experienced stigma as a\n\nresult of Virginia’s nonrecognition of their marriage.\n\n     The plaintiffs’ complaint, filed in July 2013, alleged that\n\nVirginia’s          marriage    laws    violate          their    constitutional        rights\n\nunder    the    Due     Process        and    Equal       Protection     Clauses       of    the\n\nFourteenth          Amendment.         They    named       as     defendants        George    E.\n\nSchaefer, III, Clerk of Court for the Norfolk Circuit Court, and\n\nJanet M. Rainey, the State Registrar of Vital Records.                                A third\n\nVirginia official, Michèle B. McQuigg, Clerk of Court for the\n\nPrince William County Circuit Court, was permitted to intervene\n\nas a defendant.           As elected circuit court clerks, Schaefer and\n\nMcQuigg are responsible for issuing individual marriage licenses\n\nin the localities in which they serve.                       And Rainey, as the State\n\nRegistrar       of      Vital    Records,           is    responsible         for     ensuring\n\ncompliance      with     Virginia’s          marriage      laws,    including        the     laws\n\nchallenged in this case.\n\n     After the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\nVirginia underwent a change in administrations, and the newly\n\nelected    Attorney       General       of    Virginia,          Mark   Herring,      filed    a\n\n                                               72\n\fnotice of a change in his office’s legal position on behalf of\n\nhis    client,    defendant     Janet     Rainey.       His   notice       stated   that\n\nbecause, in his view, the laws at issue were unconstitutional,\n\nhis office would no longer defend them on behalf of Rainey.                            He\n\nnoted, however, that Rainey would continue to enforce the laws\n\nuntil the court’s ruling.              The other officials have continued to\n\ndefend Virginia’s marriage laws, and, for convenience, I refer\n\nto the defendants herein as “Virginia.”\n\n       Following a hearing, the district court, by an order and\n\nmemorandum       dated   February       14,    2014,   granted       the    plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for summary judgment and denied Virginia’s cross-motion.\n\nThe court concluded that same-sex partners have a fundamental\n\nright to marry each other under the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth     Amendment,       thus    requiring      that   Virginia’s      marriage\n\nlaws    restricting      that    right    be    narrowly      drawn    to    further    a\n\ncompelling state interest.              It concluded that the laws did not\n\nmeet    that     requirement     and,     indeed,      “fail[ed]      to    display     a\n\nrational relationship to a legitimate purpose, and so must be\n\nviewed as constitutionally infirm under even the least onerous\n\nlevel of scrutiny.”         Bostic, 970 F. Supp. 2d at 482.                    Striking\n\ndown Virginia’s marriage laws, the court also issued an order\n\nenjoining      their     enforcement      but     stayed      that    order     pending\n\nappeal.    This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                          73\n\f                                                  II\n\n       The     plaintiffs       contend          that,    as    same-sex     partners,        they\n\nhave    a    fundamental        right       to    marry    that     is   protected       by    the\n\nsubstantive          component    of    the       Due     Process    Clause      of   the     U.S.\n\nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1 (prohibiting any State\n\nfrom    depriving        “any     person         of     life,     liberty,    or      property,\n\nwithout due process of law”), and that Virginia’s laws defining\n\nmarriage as only between a man and a woman and excluding same-\n\nsex    marriage        infringe        on    that        right.       The    constitutional\n\nanalysis for adjudging their claim is well established.\n\n       The Constitution contains no language directly protecting\n\nthe right to same-sex marriage or even traditional marriage.\n\nAny    right    to     same-sex    marriage,             therefore,      would    have    to   be\n\nfound, through court interpretation, as a substantive component\n\nof     the     Due     Process     Clause.

And the Supreme Court\n\nhas held that liberty interests are only fundamental if they\n\nare, “objectively, ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and\n\n                                                  74\n\ftradition,’ and ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,’\n\nsuch that ‘neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were\n\nsacrificed.’”        Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720-21 (citation omitted)\n\n(quoting Moore, 431 U.S. at 503 (plurality opinion); Palko, 302\n\nU.S. at 325-26).

This “careful description” involves characterizing the\n\nright asserted in its narrowest terms.                  Thus, in Glucksberg,\n\nwhere the Court was presented with a due process challenge to a\n\nstate      statute   banning   assisted      suicide,      the    Court    narrowly\n\ncharacterized the right being asserted in the following manner:\n\n      The Court of Appeals stated that “[p]roperly analyzed,\n      the first issue to be resolved is whether there is a\n      liberty interest in determining the time and manner of\n      one’s death,” or, in other words, “[i]s there a right\n      to die?”   Similarly, respondents assert a “liberty to\n      choose how to die” and a right to “control of one’s\n      final days,” and describe the asserted liberty as “the\n      right to choose a humane, dignified death,” and “the\n      liberty to shape death.”    As noted above, we have a\n      tradition of carefully formulating the interest at\n      stake in substantive-due-process cases. . . .      The\n      Washington statute at issue in this case prohibits\n      “aid[ing] another person to attempt suicide,” and,\n      thus, the question before us is whether the “liberty”\n      specially protected by the Due Process Clause includes\n      a right to commit suicide which itself includes a\n      right to assistance in doing so.\n\nGlucksberg,      521    U.S.   at    722-23      (alterations      in     original)\n\n(emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n\n                                       75\n\f     Under this formulation, because the Virginia laws at issue\n\nprohibit “marriage between persons of the same sex,” Va.

They argue that this\n\napproach is supported by the fact that the Supreme Court did not\n\nnarrowly   define      the    right    to   marriage    in   its   decisions    in\n\nLoving, 388 U.S. at 12; Turner, 482 U.S. at 94-96; or Zablocki,\n\n434 U.S. at 383-86.\n\n     It    is   true    that,     in   those   cases,    the    Court    did   not\n\nrecognize new, separate fundamental rights to fit the factual\n\ncircumstances in each case.            For example, in Loving, the Court\n\ndid not examine whether interracial marriage was, objectively,\n\ndeeply rooted in our Nation’s history and tradition.                 But it was\n\nnot required to do so.            Each of those cases involved a couple\n\nasserting a right to enter into a traditional marriage of the\n\ntype that has always been recognized since the beginning of the\n\nNation -- a union between one man and one woman.                        While the\n\ncontext for asserting the right varied in each of those cases,\n\nit varied only in ways irrelevant to the concept of marriage.\n\nThe type of relationship sought was always the traditional, man-\n\nwoman relationship to which the term “marriage” was theretofore\n\nalways assumed to refer.           Thus, none of the cases cited by the\n\nplaintiffs and relied on by the majority involved the assertion\n\n                                        78\n\fof a brand new liberty interest.                 To the contrary, they involved\n\nthe assertion of one of the oldest and most fundamental liberty\n\ninterests in our society.\n\n       To now define the previously recognized fundamental right\n\nto    “marriage”    as    a    concept    that    includes     the    new    notion     of\n\n“same-sex marriage” amounts to a dictionary jurisprudence, which\n\ndefines terms as convenient to attain an end.\n\n       It   is    true    that    same-sex      and   opposite-sex      relationships\n\nshare many attributes, and, therefore, marriages involving those\n\nrelationships would, to a substantial extent, be similar.                              Two\n\npersons     who     are       attracted    to     each     other     physically       and\n\nemotionally and who love each other could publicly promise to\n\nlive    with      each    other     thereafter        in   a   mutually          desirable\n\nrelationship.        These aspects are the same whether the persons\n\nare    of   the    same     sex    or    different       sexes.       Moreover,      both\n\nrelationships       could      successfully      function      to    raise       children,\n\nalthough children in a same-sex relationship would come from one\n\npartner     or    from    adoption.        But    there     are     also    significant\n\ndistinctions        between       the     relationships        that        can     justify\n\ndifferential treatment by lawmakers.\n\n       Only the union of a man and a woman has the capacity to\n\nproduce children and thus to carry on the species.                               And more\n\nimportantly, only such a union creates a biological family unit\n\nthat also gives rise to a traditionally stable political unit.\n\n                                           79\n\fEvery       person’s      identity     includes       the     person’s        particular\n\nbiological        relationships,      which      create     unique    and     meaningful\n\nbonds of kinship that are extraordinarily strong and enduring\n\nand    that    have     been    afforded   a     privileged    place     in    political\n\norder      throughout     human     history.        Societies     have      accordingly\n\nenacted laws promoting the family unit -- such as those relating\n\nto sexual engagement, marriage rites, divorce, inheritance, name\n\nand title, and economic matters.                  And many societies have found\n\nfamilial bonds so critical that they have elevated marriage to\n\nbe    a    sacred   institution      trapped      with    religious     rituals.      In\n\nthese       respects,     the      traditional      man-woman        relationship     is\n\nunique.\n\n          Thus, when the Supreme Court has recognized, through the\n\nyears, that the right to marry is a fundamental right, it has\n\nemphasized        the    procreative       and    social     ordering       aspects   of\n\ntraditional marriage.            For example, it has said:             “[Marriage] is\n\nan institution, in the maintenance of which in its purity the\n\npublic is deeply interested, for it is the foundation of the\n\nfamily      and   of    society,    without      which    there   would     be   neither\n\ncivilization nor progress,” Maynard v.

[Marriage] is the\n\nfoundation of the family in our society,” Zablocki, 434 U.S. at\n\n386.\n\n       Because there exist deep, fundamental differences between\n\ntraditional       and      same-sex     marriage,          the     plaintiffs      and     the\n\nmajority   err      by     conflating        the    two    relationships          under    the\n\nloosely drawn rubric of “the right to marriage.”                                 Rather, to\n\nobtain constitutional protection, they would have to show that\n\nthe right to same-sex marriage is itself deeply rooted in our\n\nNation’s history.              They have not attempted to do so and could\n\nnot succeed if they were so to attempt.\n\n       In an effort to bridge the obvious differences between the\n\ntraditional relationship and the new same-sex relationship, the\n\nplaintiffs argue that the fundamental right to marriage “has\n\nalways been based on, and defined by, the constitutional liberty\n\nto select the partner of one’s choice.”                      (Emphasis added).            They\n\nrely heavily on Loving to assert this claim.                               In Loving, the\n\nCourt   held     that      a    state      regulation       restricting          interracial\n\nmarriage     infringed          on   the     fundamental          right     to    marriage.\n\nLoving, 388 U.S. at 12.                 But nowhere in Loving did the Court\n\nsuggest    that      the       fundamental         right    to     marry    includes       the\n\nunrestricted        right       to   marry     whomever          one   chooses,     as     the\n\n                                              81\n\fplaintiffs claim.            Indeed, Loving explicitly relied on Skinner\n\nand    Murphy,       and   both       of   those    cases    discussed        marriage     in\n\ntraditional, procreative terms.

In   Baker,    the    Minnesota        Supreme     Court\n\ninterpreted a state statute’s use of the term “marriage” to be\n\none of common usage meaning a union “between persons of the\n\nopposite sex” and thus not including same-sex marriage.                                Id. at\n\n186.     On appeal, the Supreme Court dismissed the case summarily\n\n“for want of a substantial federal question.”                           409 U.S. at 810.\n\nThe Court’s action in context indicates that the Court did not\n\nview    Loving       or    the    cases     that    preceded      it    as    providing     a\n\nfundamental right to an unrestricted choice of marriage partner.\n\nOtherwise, the state court’s decision in Baker would indeed have\n\npresented a substantial federal question.\n\n       In short, Loving simply held that race, which is completely\n\nunrelated to the institution of marriage, could not be the basis\n\nof    marital    restrictions.              See    Loving,   388   U.S.       at   12.      To\n\nstretch Loving’s holding to say that the right to marry is not\n\nlimited    by    gender      and       sexual      orientation     is    to    ignore     the\n\ninextricable, biological link between marriage and procreation\n\nthat the Supreme Court has always recognized.                           See Windsor, 133\n\n                                              82\n\fS. Ct. at 2689 (recognizing that throughout history, “marriage\n\nbetween a man and a woman no doubt had been thought of by most\n\npeople as essential to the very definition of that term and to\n\nits role and function”).          The state regulation struck down in\n\nLoving, like those in Zablocki and Turner, had no relationship\n\nto the foundational purposes of marriage, while the gender of\n\nthe individuals in a marriage clearly does.                Thus, the majority\n\nerrs, as did the district court, by interpreting the Supreme\n\nCourt’s marriage cases as establishing a right that includes\n\nsame-sex marriage.\n\n       The plaintiffs also largely ignore the problem with their\n\nposition that if the fundamental right to marriage is based on\n\n“the    constitutional   liberty    to     select   the    partner    of   one’s\n\nchoice,” as they contend, then that liberty would also extend to\n\nindividuals    seeking    state     recognition       of    other     types    of\n\nrelationships that States currently restrict, such as polygamous\n\nor incestuous relationships.        Cf. Romer v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n648-50 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting).             Such an extension would\n\nbe     a   radical    shift   in     our     understanding       of     marital\n\nrelationships.       Laws restricting polygamy are foundational to\n\nthe Union itself, having been a condition on the entrance of\n\nArizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Utah into statehood.                       Id.\n\nWhile the plaintiffs do attempt to assure us that such laws are\n\nsafe because “there are weighty government interests underlying”\n\n                                     83\n\fthem, such an argument does not bear on the question of whether\n\nthe   right    is   fundamental.         The    government’s       interests    would\n\ninstead be relevant only to whether the restriction could meet\n\nthe requisite standard of review.                And because laws prohibiting\n\npolygamous or incestuous marriages restrict individuals’ right\n\nto choose whom they would like to marry, they would, under the\n\nplaintiffs’ approach, have to be examined under strict scrutiny.\n\nPerhaps    the   government’s        interest     would    be    strong    enough    to\n\nenable such laws to survive strict scrutiny, but regardless,\n\ntoday’s decision would truly be a sweeping one if it could be\n\nunderstood to mean that individuals have a fundamental right to\n\nenter into a marriage with any person, or any people, of their\n\nchoosing.\n\n      At   bottom,     the       fundamental    right     to    marriage    does    not\n\ninclude    a   right   to    same-sex    marriage.         Under    the    Glucksberg\n\nanalysis that we are thus bound to conduct, there is no new\n\nfundamental      right      to     same-sex     marriage.          Virginia’s      laws\n\nrestricting marriage to man-woman relationships must therefore\n\nbe upheld if there is any rational basis for the laws.\n\n\n                                         III\n\n      Under rational-basis review, courts are required to give\n\nheavy deference to legislatures.               The standard\n\n      simply requires courts to                  determine       whether the\n      classification in  question                 is,   at       a   minimum,\n\n                                         84\n\f     rationally related to legitimate governmental goals.\n     In other words, the fit between the enactment and the\n     public purposes behind it need not be mathematically\n     precise.     As long as [the legislature] has a\n     reasonable basis for adopting the classification,\n     which can include “rational speculation unsupported by\n     evidence or empirical data,” the statute will pass\n     constitutional muster.     The rational basis standard\n     thus embodies an idea critical to the continuing\n     vitality of our democracy:       that courts are not\n     empowered to “sit as a superlegislature to judge the\n     wisdom   or    desirability   of   legislative  policy\n     determinations.”\n\nWilkins v.

It maintains that a traditional\n\nmarriage       is       “exclusively           [an]        opposite-sex              institution\n\n. . . inextricably            linked          to     procreation           and        biological\n\nkinship,” Windsor, 133 S.

It asserts that it has no interest in “licensing\n\nadults’ love.”\n\n       The plaintiffs accept that family stability is a legitimate\n\nstate goal, but they argue that licensing same-sex relationships\n\nwill   not   burden       Virginia’s          achievement         of   that      goal.

Here, the Commonwealth’s goal of\n\nensuring that unplanned children are raised in stable homes is\n\nfurthered only by offering the benefits of marriage to opposite-\n\nsex    couples.           As    Virginia       correctly         asserts,        “the    relevant\n\ninquiry      here    is    not       whether     excluding        same-sex        couples    from\n\nmarriage     furthers          [Virginia’s]          interest     in    steering        man-woman\n\ncouples into marriage.”                 Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether\n\nalso    recognizing            same-sex     marriages       would       further      Virginia’s\n\ninterests.

But      this      fundamentally\n\nmisunderstands        the    nature      of    marriage         benefits.         When   the\n\nCommonwealth     grants      a    marriage,        it    does    not   simply     give   the\n\ncouple a piece of paper and a title.                            Rather, it provides a\n\nsubstantial subsidy to the married couple -- economic benefits\n\nthat, the plaintiffs repeatedly assert, are being denied them.\n\nFor example, married couples are permitted to file state income\n\ntaxes jointly, lowering their tax rates.                           See Va. Code Ann.\n\n§ 58.1-324.           Although     indirect,         such       benefits    are     clearly\n\nsubsidies that come at a cost to the Commonwealth.                             Virginia is\n\nwilling    to    provide         these   subsidies          because      they     encourage\n\nopposite-sex couples to marry, which tends to provide children\n\nfrom   unplanned       pregnancies        with       a   more     stable    environment.\n\nUnder Johnson, the Commonwealth is not obligated to similarly\n\nsubsidize same-sex marriages, since doing so could not possibly\n\nfurther its interest.

Id. at 665-66.          In enacting\n\nits     marriage     laws,       Virginia        predicted      that   changing         the\n\ndefinition of marriage would have a negative effect on children\n\nand on the family structure.               Although other States do not share\n\nthose    concerns,        such    evaluations       were       nonetheless      squarely\n\nwithin the province of the Commonwealth’s legislature and its\n\ncitizens, who voted to amend Virginia’s Constitution in 2006.\n\n       Virginia     has    undoubtedly      articulated         sufficient      rational\n\nbases for its marriage laws, and I would find that those bases\n\nconstitutionally justify the laws.                  Those laws are grounded on\n\nthe biological connection of men and women; the potential for\n\ntheir    having     children;       the    family     order      needed    in       raising\n\nchildren; and, on a larger scale, the political order resulting\n\nfrom    stable     family    units.        Moreover,       I   would   add      that   the\n\ntraditional marriage relationship encourages a family structure\n\nthat is intergenerational, giving children not only a structure\n\nin    which   to    be    raised    but     also    an   identity      and      a    strong\n\nrelational context.              The marriage of a man and a woman thus\n\nrationally promotes a correlation between biological order and\n\npolitical     order.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has made it clear\n\nthat\n\n       where individuals in the group affected by a law have\n       distinguishing characteristics relevant to interests\n       the State has the authority to implement, the courts\n       have been very reluctant, as they should be in our\n       federal system and with our respect for the separation\n       of powers, to closely scrutinize legislative choices\n       as to whether, how, and to what extent those interests\n       should be pursued.

This      is      based   on   the\n\nunderstanding that “equal protection of the laws must coexist\n\n\n                                            92\n\fwith the practical necessity that most legislation classifies\n\nfor    one    purpose      or    another,       with      resulting    disadvantage        to\n\nvarious groups or persons.”               Romer, 517 U.S. at 631.\n\n       The plaintiffs contend that Virginia’s marriage laws should\n\nbe subjected to some level of heightened scrutiny because they\n\ndiscriminate        on    the    basis    of     sexual     orientation.           Yet    they\n\nconcede that neither the Supreme Court nor the Fourth Circuit\n\nhas ever applied heightened scrutiny to a classification based\n\non sexual orientation.               They urge this court to do so for the\n\nfirst time.        Governing precedent, however, counsels otherwise.\n\n       In Romer v.

Applying that standard, I conclude that\n\nthere is a rational basis for the laws, as explained in Part\n\nIII, above.        At bottom, I agree with Justice Alito’s reasoning\n\nthat   “[i]n    asking     the    court    to    determine      that   [Virginia’s\n\nmarriage laws are] subject to and violate[] heightened scrutiny,\n\n[the plaintiffs] thus ask us to rule that the presence of two\n\nmembers of the opposite sex is as rationally related to marriage\n\nas white skin is to voting or a Y-chromosome is to the ability\n\nto administer an estate.            That is a striking request and one\n\nthat unelected judges should pause before granting.”                        Windsor,\n\n133 S. Ct. at 2717-18 (Alito, J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                          V\n\n       Whether to recognize same-sex marriage is an ongoing and\n\nhighly engaged political debate taking place across the Nation,\n\nand the States are divided on the issue.                 The majority of courts\n\nhave   struck   down     statutes    that      deny   recognition      of   same-sex\n\nmarriage, doing so almost exclusively on the idea that same-sex\n\nmarriage is encompassed by the fundamental right to marry that\n\nis protected by the Due Process Clause.                    While I express no\n\nviewpoint on the merits of the policy debate, I do strongly\n\ndisagree with the assertion that same-sex marriage is subject to\n\n\n                                          97\n\fthe same constitutional protections as the traditional right to\n\nmarry.\n\n      Because there is no fundamental right to same-sex marriage\n\nand there are rational reasons for not recognizing it, just as\n\nthere are rational reasons for recognizing it, I conclude that\n\nwe,   in   the   Third    Branch,   must     allow   the    States    to   enact\n\nlegislation on the subject in accordance with their political\n\nprocesses.       The   U.S.   Constitution    does   not,   in   my   judgment,\n\nrestrict the States’ policy choices on this issue.               If given the\n\nchoice, some States will surely recognize same-sex marriage and\n\nsome will surely not.         But that is, to be sure, the beauty of\n\nfederalism.\n\n      I would reverse the district court’s judgment and defer to\n\nVirginia’s political choice in defining marriage as only between\n\none man and one woman.\n\n\n\n\n                                     98\n\f</pre>",
