Brown Univ.,  809 F.  Supp. 978 (D.R.I.  1992).   After<br>          _____     ___________<br><br>          mapping  Title IX's rugged  legal terrain and  cutting a passable<br><br>          swath through  the factual thicket that  overspreads the parties'<br><br>          arguments, we affirm.<br><br>          I.  BROWN ATHLETICS:  AN OVERVIEW<br>          I.  BROWN ATHLETICS:  AN OVERVIEW<br><br>                    College  athletics,   particularly  in  the   realm  of<br><br>          football and basketball,  has traditionally occupied  a prominent<br><br>          role  in  American  sports  and American  society.    For college<br><br>          students, athletics offers an  opportunity to exacuate leadership<br><br>          skills, learn teamwork, build  self-confidence, and perfect self-<br><br>          discipline.    In addition,  for many  student-athletes, physical<br><br>          skills  are a  passport to  college admissions  and scholarships,<br><br>          allowing them  to attend  otherwise inaccessible schools.   These<br><br>          opportunities, and the lessons learned on the playing fields, are<br><br>          invaluable in attaining career  and life successes in and  out of<br><br>          professional sports.<br><br>                    The  highway of  opportunity runs  in both  directions.<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1The individual defendants are, respectively,  the President<br>          and  Athletic Director of  the University.   Each is  sued in his<br>          official capacity.  For ease in reference, we discuss this appeal<br>          as if Brown was  the sole defendant and appellant.   Nonetheless,<br>          our opinion applies equally to all parties.<br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Not only  student-athletes, but  universities, too,  benefit from<br><br>          the magic  of intercollegiate sports.   Successful teams generate<br><br>          television   revenues   and  gate   receipts  which   often  fund<br><br>          significant   percentages  of  a  university's  overall  athletic<br><br>          program, offering  students the opportunity to  partake of sports<br><br>          that   are   not  financially   self-sustaining.     Even   those<br><br>          institutions whose teams do not fill the grandstands of cavernous<br><br>          stadiums  or attract  national television  exposure benefit  from<br><br>          increased  student  and  alumni   cohesion  and  the  support  it<br><br>          engenders.   Thus,  universities  nurture the  legends, great  or<br><br>          small, inhering  in their  athletic past, polishing  the hardware<br><br>          that adorns field-house trophy cases and reliving heroic exploits<br><br>          in the pages of alumni magazines.<br><br>                    In these terms, Brown will never be confused with Notre<br><br>          Dame or the  more muscular members of the Big  Ten.  Although its<br><br>          football  team did  play  in the  1916 Rose  Bowl  and its  men's<br><br>          basketball  team won the  Ivy League championship  as recently as<br><br>          1986, Brown's  athletic  program has  only occasionally  achieved<br><br>          national  prominence  or,  for  that  matter,  enjoyed  sustained<br><br>          success.2  Moreover,  at Brown, as  at most schools, women  are a<br><br>          relatively  inconspicuous part  of  the  storied  athletic  past.<br><br>          Historically,  colleges limited  athletics  to  the male  sphere,<br><br>          leaving  those few women's  teams that  sprouted to  scrounge for<br><br>          resources.<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2We note, not without a certain irony, that  the now-demoted<br>          women's   volleyball  and   gymnastics   teams  won   Ivy  League<br>          championships in 1988 and 1990, respectively.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    The absence  of women's  athletics at Brown  was, until<br><br>          1970, an ineluctable  consequence of the absence  of women; Brown<br><br>          sponsored a women's college   Pembroke   but did not itself admit<br><br>          women.    In 1971,  Brown  subsumed  Pembroke.    Brown  promptly<br><br>          upgraded Pembroke's  rather primitive athletic  offerings so that<br><br>          by 1977 there were fourteen women's varsity teams.  In subsequent<br><br>          years, Brown  added only one distaff team:  winter track.  Hence,<br><br>          in  the  1991-92 academic  year,  Brown  fielded fifteen  women's<br><br>          varsity teams   one fewer than the number of men's varsity teams.<br><br>          II.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS<br>          II.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS<br><br>                    In the  spring of 1991,  Brown announced that  it, like<br><br>          many other schools, was in a financial bind, and that, as a belt-<br><br>          tightening  measure,  it planned  to  drop four  sports  from its<br><br>          intercollegiate varsity  athletic roster:  women's volleyball and<br><br>          gymnastics, men's  golf and water polo.  The University permitted<br><br>          the  teams  to continue  playing  as  \"intercollegiate clubs,\"  a<br><br>          status  that allowed them  to compete against  varsity teams from<br><br>          other  colleges,3 but  cut  off financial  subsidies and  support<br><br>          services  routinely available  to  varsity teams  (e.g., salaried<br>                                                             ____<br><br>          coaches, access  to prime  facilities,  preferred practice  time,<br><br>          medical trainers, clerical  assistance, office support, admission<br><br>          preferences,  and the  like).   Brown estimated  that eliminating<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               3As a practical matter, many schools with varsity squads are<br>          reluctant  to  compete  against  club teams.    This  case  aptly<br>          illustrates  the point.   As  soon as  Brown demoted  its women's<br>          volleyball  team  from  varsity   to  club  status,  Northeastern<br>          University and  West Point  declined to include  Brown on  future<br>          volleyball schedules.  See Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 993.<br>                                 ___ _____<br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          these  four varsity  teams would save  $77,813 per  annum, broken<br><br>          down   as  follows:     women's   volleyball,  $37,127;   women's<br><br>          gymnastics,  $24,901;  men's  water  polo,  $9,250;  men's  golf,<br><br>          $6,545.<br><br>                    Before the  cuts, Brown athletics  offered an aggregate<br><br>          of  328 varsity slots for  female athletes and  566 varsity slots<br><br>          for  male  athletes.   Thus,  women  had  36.7%  of the  athletic<br><br>          opportunities and men  63.3%.  Abolishing the four  varsity teams<br><br>          took substantially more dollars  from the women's athletic budget<br><br>          than from the  men's budget,  but did not  materially affect  the<br><br>          athletic   opportunity  ratios;  women   retained  36.6%  of  the<br><br>          opportunities and men  63.4%.  At that time (and  for a number of<br><br>          years    prior   thereto),   Brown's   student   body   comprised<br><br>          approximately 52% men and 48% women.<br><br>                    Following   Brown's   announcement  of   the  cutbacks,<br><br>          disappointed  members of  the women's  volleyball and  gymnastics<br><br>          teams brought suit.  They proceeded on an implied cause of action<br><br>          under Title IX, 20 U.S.C.     1681-1688 (1988).

The<br><br>          gridiron  fueled these  concerns:   for many  schools, the  men's<br><br>          football budget far exceeded  that of any other sport,  and men's<br><br>          athletics  as  a whole  received  the lion's  share  of dedicated<br><br>          resources   a share  that, typically, was vastly disproportionate<br><br>          to the percentage of men in the student body.<br><br>                    Part of the  confusion about  the scope  of Title  IX's<br><br>          coverage  and the acceptable avenues of compliance arose from the<br><br>          absence of secondary legislative materials.  Congress included no<br><br>          committee report with  the final bill  and there were  apparently<br><br>          only   two  mentions  of  intercollegiate  athletics  during  the<br><br>          congressional debate.

Four years later, HEW's Office<br><br>          of Civil  Rights (OCR) added another layer of regulatory exegesis<br><br>          when,  after   notice  and   comment,  it  published   a  \"Policy<br><br>          Interpretation\"  that offered  a more  detailed measure  of equal<br><br>          athletic opportunity.<br><br>                    In  1984,  the  Supreme  Court  radically  altered  the<br><br>          contemporary reading of Title  IX.  The Court held that  Title IX<br><br>          was \"program-specific,\"  so that its  tenets applied only  to the<br><br>          program(s)  which actually received federal  funds and not to the<br><br>          rest  of the university.

After listing  a number of  exempt<br><br>          organizations,  section 1681  makes  clear that,  while Title  IX<br><br>          prohibits  discrimination, it  does not mandate  strict numerical<br><br>          equality  between  the gender  balance  of  a college's  athletic<br><br>          program  and the  gender  balance of  its  student body.    Thus,<br><br>          section 1681(a) shall not<br><br>                    be  interpreted  to  require any  educational<br>                    institution   to    grant   preferential   or<br>                    disparate treatment to the members of one sex<br>                    on account  of an  imbalance which  may exist<br>                    with  respect   to   the  total   number   or<br>                    percentage   of   persons    of   that    sex<br>                    participating in or receiving the benefits of<br>                    any federally supported program  or activity,<br>                    in   comparison  with  the  total  number  or<br>                    percentage of  persons  of that  sex  in  any<br>                    community,  State,  section,  or other  area:<br>                    Provided, That this  subsection shall not  be<br>                    ________<br>                    construed to prevent the consideration in any<br>                    hearing  or proceeding under  this chapter of<br>                    statistical  evidence  tending  to show  that<br>                    such an  imbalance exists with respect to the<br>                    participation in, or receipt of  the benefits<br>                    of,  any  such  program or  activity  by  the<br>                    members of one sex.<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               6This lacuna apparently results from a political compromise.<br>          After the Conference Committee  deleted an amendment to  Title IX<br>          that would have  exempted \"revenue-producing\" athletics, Congress<br>          asked the  Secretary of  HEW to provide  regulations specifically<br>          governing athletics.

Put another  way, a court assessing<br><br>          Title IX compliance may not find a violation solely because there<br>                                                       ______<br><br>          is  a disparity between the gender  composition of an educational<br><br>          institution's  student constituency,  on  the one  hand, and  its<br><br>          athletic programs, on the other hand.<br><br>                    That  is not to say,  however, that evidence  of such a<br><br>          disparity  is irrelevant.  Quite the contrary:  under the proviso<br><br>          contained in section 1681(b), a Title IX plaintiff in an athletic<br><br>          discrimination  suit  must   accompany  statistical  evidence  of<br><br>          disparate impact with  some further  evidence of  discrimination,<br><br>          such as unmet needamongst the members of thedisadvantaged gender.<br><br>                              C.

Thereafter,  in  1979,  Congress split  HEW  into  the<br><br>          Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department<br><br>          of Education  (DED).  See  20 U.S.C.     3401-3510 (1988).

Nevertheless,  DED is the  principle locus of<br><br>          ongoing  enforcement  activity.    See  20  U.S.C.     3441(a)(1)<br>                                             ___<br><br>          (transferring all education functions of HEW to DED); see also 20<br>                                                                ___ ____<br><br>          U.S.C.   3441(a)(3) (transferring  education-related OCR work  to<br><br>          DED).

The  Regulations.<br>                          ________________<br><br>          detailing  Title IX's  application  to college  athletics.8   The<br><br>          regulations also recognize, however, that an athletic program may<br><br>          consist  of  gender-segregated  teams  as  long  as  one  of  two<br><br>          conditions is met:  either the  sport in which the team  competes<br><br>          is  a contact sport or the institution offers comparable teams in<br><br>          the sport to both genders.  See 34 C.F.R.   106.41(b).<br>                                      ___<br><br>                    Finally, whether  teams are  segregated by sex  or not,<br><br>          the school  must provide gender-blind equality  of opportunity to<br><br>          its  student  body.     The  regulations  offer  a  non-exclusive<br><br>          compendium of ten  factors which OCR  will consider in  assessing<br><br>          compliance with this mandate:<br><br>                         (1) Whether the  selection of sports and<br>                    levels of competition effectively accommodate<br>                    the  interests  and abilities  of  members of<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               8The regulations provide:<br><br>                    No  person shall,  on  the basis  of sex,  be<br>                    excluded from participation in, be denied the<br>                    benefits  of,  be  treated  differently  from<br>                    another person or otherwise  be discriminated<br>                    against      in      any     interscholastic,<br>                    intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics<br>                    offered  by  a  recipient,  and  no recipient<br>                    shall provide any  such athletics  separately<br>                    on such basis.<br><br>          34 C.F.R.   106.41(a) (1992).<br><br>                                          13<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    both sexes;<br>                         (2)  The  provision  of   equipment  and<br>                    supplies;<br>                         (3)  Scheduling  of  games and  practice<br>                    time;<br>                         (4) Travel and per diem allowance;<br>                         (5) Opportunity to receive  coaching and<br>                    academic tutoring;<br>                         (6)   Assignment  and   compensation  of<br>                    coaches and tutors;<br>                         (7) Provision of locker  rooms, practice<br>                    and competitive facilities;<br>                         (8)  Provision  of medical  and training<br>                    facilities and services;<br>                         (9)  Provision  of  housing  and  dining<br>                    facilities and services;<br>                         (10) Publicity.<br><br>          34 C.F.R.    106.41(c) (1992).9   The district  court rested  its<br><br>          preliminary  injunction  on  the  first of  these  ten  areas  of<br><br>          inquiry:     Brown's  failure  effectively   to  accommodate  the<br><br>          interests  and abilities of female  students in the selection and<br><br>          level of sports.   See Cohen, 809 F.  Supp. at 994.  Hence,  this<br>                             ___ _____<br><br>          area  is the  most critical  in terms  of evaluating  the charges<br><br>          against  Brown  (although  it  is  also  the  most  difficult  to<br><br>          measure).<br><br>                    2.  The Policy Interpretation.  In the three years next<br>                    2.  The Policy Interpretation.<br>                        _________________________<br><br>          following the  initial issuance of the  regulations, HEW received<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               9The same regulation also stipulates that:<br><br>                    Unequal aggregate expenditures for members of<br>                    each sex or unequal expenditures for male and<br>                    female  teams  if  a  recipient  operates  or<br>                    sponsors separate teams  will not  constitute<br>                    noncompliance  with  this section,  but [DED]<br>                    may consider the failure to provide necessary<br>                    funds  for  teams  for one  sex  in assessing<br>                    equality of opportunity  for members of  each<br>                    sex.<br><br>          34 C.F.R.   106.41(c) (1992).<br><br>                                          14<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          over one  hundred discrimination  complaints involving  more than<br><br>          fifty schools.   In order to encourage  self-policing and thereby<br><br>          winnow complaints, HEW proposed a Policy Interpretation.   See 43<br>                                                                     ___<br><br>          Fed.  Reg.  58,070  (1978).

Reg. 71,413  (1979), a<br>                                         ___<br><br>          matter of months before the effective date of the statute through<br><br>          which Congress, emulating King  Solomon, split HEW.   The parties<br><br>          are in agreement  that, at  DED's birth, it  clutched the  Policy<br><br>          Interpretation, and,  as a practical  matter, that appears  to be<br><br>          the case.10   See, e.g., DED,  Title IX Athletics  Investigator's<br>                        ___  ____        __________________________________<br><br>          Manual  1, 2  (1990)  (Manual); see  also  Complaint Letter  from<br>          ______                          ___  ____<br><br>          Regional Civil  Rights Director,  DED, to Dr.  Martin Massengale,<br><br>          Chancellor, Univ. of  Nebraska (July 10,  1989) (noting that  DED<br><br>          \"ha[s]   followed   the   directions  provided   in   the  Policy<br><br>          Interpretation\");  Complaint Letter  from  Regional Civil  Rights<br><br>          Director, DED, to  Dr. Charles  A.

Feb.  4,  1993),  have  adopted  this<br><br>          formulation and ruled that  a university violates Title IX  if it<br><br>          ineffectively  accommodates  student   interests  and   abilities<br><br>          regardless of its performance in other Title IX areas.<br><br>                    Equal opportunity  to participate  lies at the  core of<br><br>          Title IX's purpose.  Because the third compliance area delineates<br><br>          this  heartland, we agree with  the district courts  that have so<br><br>          ruled and hold that,  with regard to the effective  accommodation<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               11The  Manual divides Title IX coverage  into the same three<br>          areas and notes  that \"an  investigation may be  limited to  less<br>          than all three of these major areas.\"  Manual at 7.<br><br>                                          16<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          of students' interests and  abilities, an institution can violate<br><br>          Title  IX  even  if  it  meets  the  \"financial  assistance\"  and<br><br>          \"athletic equivalence\" standards.  In other words, an institution<br><br>          that offers women a smaller number of athletic opportunities than<br><br>          the  statute requires may  not rectify  that violation  simply by<br><br>          lavishing more resources on  those women or achieving equivalence<br><br>          in other respects.12<br><br><br><br>                    3.

In  surveying  the dimensions  of this<br><br>          battleground, that  is, whether an  athletic program  effectively<br><br>          accommodates   students'  interests  and  abilities,  the  Policy<br><br>          Interpretation  maps   a  trinitarian   model  under  which   the<br><br>          university must meet at least one of three benchmarks:<br><br>                         (1)   Whether   intercollegiate    level<br>                    participation  opportunities   for  male  and<br>                    female  students  are  provided   in  numbers<br>                    substantially    proportionate    to    their<br>                    respective enrollments; or<br>                         (2) Where  the members  of one  sex have<br>                    been    and   are    underrepresented   among<br>                    intercollegiate    athletes,   whether    the<br>                    institution can show a history and continuing<br>                    practice  of  program   expansion  which   is<br>                    demonstrably  responsive  to  the  developing<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               12In any  event, both the financial  assistance and athletic<br>          equivalence standards are inapposite for present purposes.

Reg.  at 71,418.   The first benchmark  furnishes a safe<br><br>          harbor  for those  institutions  that  have distributed  athletic<br><br>          opportunities  in numbers  \"substantially  proportionate\" to  the<br><br>          gender composition  of their student bodies.   Thus, a university<br><br>          which does  not wish to  engage in extensive  compliance analysis<br><br>          may stay  on the  sunny side of  Title IX  simply by  maintaining<br><br>          gender parity between its student body and its athletic lineup.<br><br><br><br>                    The second  and third  parts of the  accommodation test<br><br>          recognize  that  there  are   circumstances  under  which,  as  a<br><br>          practical matter,  something short  of this proportionality  is a<br><br>          satisfactory proxy for gender balance.  For example, so long as a<br><br>          university is continually expanding athletic opportunities in  an<br><br>          ongoing effort to meet the  needs of the underrepresented gender,<br><br>          and persists in this  approach as interest and ability  levels in<br><br>          its student body and secondary feeder schools rise, benchmark two<br><br>          is  satisfied and Title IX  does not require  that the university<br><br>          leap  to complete  gender parity  in a  single bound.   Or,  if a<br><br>          school has a student body  in which one sex is demonstrably  less<br><br>          interested in  athletics,  Title IX  does  not require  that  the<br><br><br>                                          18<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          school  create   teams  for,   or  rain  money   upon,  otherwise<br><br>          disinterested students; rather, the  third benchmark is satisfied<br><br>          if the underrepresented sex's discernible interests are fully and<br><br>          effectively accommodated.13<br><br>                    It seems unlikely, even  in this day and age,  that the<br><br>          athletic  establishments  of   many  coeducational   universities<br><br>          reflect   the   gender   balance  of   their   student  bodies.14<br><br>          Similarly, the recent boom in Title IX suits suggests that, in an<br><br>          era of  fiscal austerity,  few universities  are prone  to expand<br><br>          athletic opportunities.  It is not surprising, then, that schools<br><br>          more often than not attempt  to manage the rigors of Title  IX by<br><br>          satisfying the  interests and abilities  of the  underrepresented<br><br>          gender,   that  is,  by  meeting   the  third  benchmark  of  the<br><br>          accommodation  test.

Brown  suggests that, to<br><br>          the extent students' interests in athletics are  disproportionate<br><br>          by  gender, colleges  should be  allowed to meet  those interests<br><br>          incompletely  as  long  as the  school's  response  is in  direct<br><br>          proportion to the  comparative levels of interest.   Put bluntly,<br><br>          Brown reads the \"full\" out of the duty to accommodate  \"fully and<br><br>          effectively.\"      It   argues   instead  that   an   institution<br><br>          satisfactorily  accommodates  female  athletes  if  it  allocates<br><br>          athletic  opportunities to women in accordance  with the ratio of<br>                                           ________________________________<br><br>          interested and able  women to interested and able men, regardless<br>          _____________________________________________________<br><br>          of the number of unserved women or the  percentage of the student<br><br>          body that they comprise.<br><br>                    Because  this is  mountainous terrain,  an example  may<br><br>          serve to clarify the distinction between Brown's proposal and our<br><br>          understanding of the law.   Suppose a university (Oooh U.)  has a<br><br>          student body  consisting of 1,000 men  and 1,000 women, a  one to<br><br>          one ratio.   If 500  men and  250 women are  able and  interested<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               15If  in  the  course  of  adding  and  upgrading  teams,  a<br>          university attains gender parity between its athletic program and<br>          its  student   body,  it  meets   the  first  benchmark   of  the<br>          accommodation test.  But, Title IX does not require that a school<br>          pour ever-increasing sums into its athletic establishment.  If  a<br>          university  prefers to  take  another route,  it  can also  bring<br>          itself  into   compliance  with   the  first  benchmark   of  the<br>          accommodation test  by subtraction  and downgrading, that  is, by<br>          reducing  opportunities  for  the  overrepresented  gender  while<br>          keeping opportunities stable for the underrepresented gender  (or<br>          reducing them to a much lesser extent).<br><br>                                          21<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          athletes,  the ratio of interested men to interested women is two<br><br>          to one.   Brown takes  the position that  both the actual  gender<br><br>          composition of  the  student  body  and whether  there  is  unmet<br><br>          interest among  the  underrepresented gender  are irrelevant;  in<br><br>          order to satisfy the  third benchmark, Oooh U. must  only provide<br><br>          athletic  opportunities in  line with  the two to  one interested<br><br>          athlete  ratio, say,  100 slots for  men and 50  slots for women.<br><br>          Under this view, the interest  of 200 women would be unmet    but<br><br>          there would be no Title IX violation.<br><br>                    We  think  that  Brown's  perception of  the  Title  IX<br><br>          universe  is myopic.  The fact that the overrepresented gender is<br><br>          less than fully accommodated will not, in and of itself, excuse a<br><br>          shortfall   in   the   provision   of   opportunities   for   the<br><br>          underrepresented gender.  Rather, the  law requires that, in  the<br><br>          absence of continuing program  expansion (benchmark two), schools<br><br>          either meet benchmark one  by providing athletic opportunities in<br><br>          proportion to the gender composition of the student body (in Oooh<br><br>          U.'s case, a roughly equal number  of slots for men and women, as<br><br>          the  student body is equally divided), or meet benchmark three by<br><br>          fully    accommodating    interested    athletes     among    the<br><br>          underrepresented  sex  (providing,  at  Oooh U.,  250  slots  for<br><br>          women).16<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               16Of  course, if Oooh U. takes the benchmark three route, it<br>          will also have to provide  at least the same number of  slots for<br>          men; but, so long as women remain the underrepresented gender and<br>          their  interests  are  fully  accommodated,  the  university  can<br>          provide as many (or as  few) additional slots for men as  it sees<br>          fit.<br><br>                                          22<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In  the final  analysis, Brown's view  is wrong  on two<br><br>          scores.   It  is wrong  as  a matter  of  law, for  DED's  Policy<br><br>          Interpretation,   which  requires   full  accommodation   of  the<br><br>          underrepresented gender,  draws  its essence  from  the  statute.<br><br>          Whether  Brown's concept  might  be thought  more attractive,  or<br><br>          whether  we, if  writing  on a  pristine  page, would  craft  the<br><br>          regulation  in a manner different  than the agency,  are not very<br><br>          important considerations.  Because  the agency's rendition stands<br><br>          upon a plausible, if not inevitable, reading of Title IX,  we are<br><br>          obligated  to enforce the regulation according to its tenor.

It  proceeds from the premise that  the agency's<br><br>          third  benchmark countervails  Title  IX.   But, this  particular<br><br>          imprecation of  the third benchmark  overlooks the  accommodation<br><br>          test's  general purpose:  to determine whether a student has been<br><br>          \"excluded from participation in, [or] denied the benefits  of\" an<br><br>          athletic  program \"on  the basis  of sex .  . .  .\"   20 U.S.C.  <br><br>          1681(a).

Given that the survey of  interests and abilities<br><br>          would begin under circumstances where men's athletic teams have a<br><br>          considerable head start, such a rule would almost certainly blunt<br><br>          the  exhortation  that  schools  should \"take  into  account  the<br><br>          nationally increasing levels of women's  interests and abilities\"<br><br>          and avoid \"disadvantag[ing] members  of an underrepresented sex .<br><br>          . . .\"  44 Fed.

Student plaintiffs, who  carry the burden  of proof on this<br><br>          issue, as well as  universities monitoring self-compliance, would<br><br>          be required  to assess the level of interest in both the male and<br><br>          female  student  populations   and  determine  comparatively  how<br><br>          completely the university was serving the interests of each  sex.<br><br>          By contrast, as we read the accommodation test's third benchmark,<br><br>          it requires  a relatively simple  assessment of whether  there is<br><br>          unmet need in the  underrepresented gender that rises to  a level<br><br>          sufficient to warrant a new team or the upgrading of an  existing<br><br>          team.

In this<br>          ________________<br><br>          case,  the  district  court  paid  meticulous  attention  to  the<br><br>          parties' prospects for  success over  the long haul.   The  court<br><br>          plainly  visualized  both  the  factual   intricacies  and  legal<br><br>          complexities that  characterize Title IX  litigation.  It  held a<br><br>          lengthy  adversary   hearing  and  reviewed   voluminous  written<br><br>          submissions.  And at  journey's end, it correctly focused  on the<br><br>          three-part accommodation test.<br><br>                    The court faultlessly dispatched the first two elements<br><br>          of  the test.   With  respect to  the comparison  between Brown's<br><br>          athletic  agenda and  student body,  we  adopt the  lower court's<br><br>          record-rooted  finding that the University did not meet   or even<br><br>          closely  approach    the \"substantial  proportionality\" threshold<br><br>          because  it offered too few varsity opportunities for women.  See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          Cohen, 809  F. Supp.  at 991.   Cognizant, perhaps, that  the raw<br>          _____<br><br>          numbers tell an  unambiguous tale, Brown  does not challenge  the<br><br>          inviolability of this finding.<br><br>                    As  to the  test's second  part, the court  below found<br><br>          that, although Brown  could point to  \"impressive growth\" in  its<br><br>          women's athletic  program  in  the  1970s,  the  school  had  not<br><br><br>                                          32<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          continued  filling the gap during the next  two decades.  Id.  On<br>                                                                    ___<br><br>          this  basis, the  court  concluded that  Brown  had not  met  the<br><br>          benchmark.  See id.  Brown asserts that  the district court erred<br>                      ___ ___<br><br>          by not crediting  it sufficiently for  its dramatic expansion  of<br><br>          women's   sports  in  the   1970s,  and   we  are   not  entirely<br><br>          unsympathetic  to this plea.  In the last analysis, however, this<br><br>          was  a judgment  call  and the  trial  court's judgment  was  not<br><br>          unreasonable.   While a university deserves  appreciable applause<br><br>          for  supercharging a  low-voltage athletic  program in  one burst<br><br>          rather  than powering  it  up  over  a  longer  period,  such  an<br><br>          energization,   once  undertaken,  does   not  forever  hold  the<br><br>          institution harmless.  Here, Brown labored for six years to weave<br><br>          a broad array of new activities into the fabric of its palestrian<br><br>          offerings.  The district court apparently believed, however, that<br><br>          Brown  then rested on its  laurels for at  least twice that long.<br><br>          The very length of this hiatus  suggests something far short of a<br><br>          continuing  practice  of program  expansion.    And, moreover,  a<br>          __________<br><br>          university must design expansion in whatever form and at whatever<br><br>          pace to respond  to the  flux and reflux  of unserved  interests.<br><br>          The court  below found that Brown  failed in this task.   See id.<br>                                                                    ___ ___<br><br>          The  issue  of  responsiveness  is  fact-intensive  and  in  most<br><br>          instances, as  here, its  resolution will  be within the  trier's<br><br>          province.  We find  no error, therefore, in the  district court's<br><br>          resolution of the second aspect of the accommodation test.<br><br>                    The  third  benchmark   presents  a  more   problematic<br><br>          scenario.   The district  court incorrectly held  that Brown bore<br><br><br>                                          33<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          the  burden  of  showing  that  it  had  fully  and   effectively<br><br>          accommodated the  interests and abilities of  its women athletes.<br><br>          See  id. at 997.   Section 1681(b) requires  that the plaintiffs,<br>          ___  ___<br><br>          rather than the  University, prove  a shortfall in  the full  and<br><br>          effective accommodation of interested female athletes by showing,<br><br>          initially,  both numerical  disparity  and unmet  interest.   See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          supra Part  V.   Nonetheless, we  do not think  that the  court's<br>          _____<br><br>          bevue is  fatal.  Even  when a  trial court has  misconstrued the<br><br>          law, an appellate tribunal  may avoid remanding if the  record is<br><br>          sufficiently  developed  and the  facts  necessary  to shape  the<br><br>          proper legal matrix  are sufficiently clear.   See, e.g., Societe<br>                                                         ___  ____  _______<br><br>          Des Produits Nestle, S.A.  v.

Although the full and  effective<br><br>          accommodation of athletic interests is likely to be a complicated<br><br>          issue where allegedly underrepresented  plaintiffs sue to force a<br><br>          university  to create a neoteric team or  upgrade the status of a<br><br>          club team,  see,  e.g., Cook,  802  F.

The court  found, for  example,<br><br>          that there was \"great interest and talent\" amongst Brown's female<br><br>          undergraduates  which,  following  the cuts,  would  go unserved.<br><br>          Cohen, 809 F.

Of particular moment, the court also<br>          _____<br><br>          found  the interest and talent on campus ample to support women's<br><br>          varsity volleyball and gymnastics teams, see id.   a finding that<br>                                                   ___ ___<br><br>          is hardly surprising in  view of the teams' robust  health before<br><br>          the  budget-cutters arrived on the scene.  The court proceeded to<br><br>          note that, while  club teams can be equivalent to intercollegiate<br><br>          teams when they regularly participate in varsity competition, see<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          44 Fed.

Because the record  contains nothing that  would allow a<br><br>          trier to find that Brown's athletic agenda reflects the makeup of<br><br>          its  student  body  or that  the  plaintiff  class  is so  poorly<br><br>          populated as  to warrant  a reduction  in  women's sports,21  the<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               21It  bears mentioning  in  this regard  that Judge  Pettine<br>          heard, and  apparently credited, evidence  indicating that  there<br>          were  other  women's  club teams  sufficiently  accomplished  and<br><br>                                          35<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          court's  error was harmless.

The<br><br>          district court  heard from  a variety of  athletic administration<br><br>          experts.  The court concluded that, absent judicial intervention,<br><br>          the plaintiffs would suffer irremediable injury in at least three<br><br>          respects:    competitive   posture,  recruitment,  and   loss  of<br><br>          coaching.   As  club teams,  the district  court thought  women's<br><br>          volleyball   and  gymnastics   would  increasingly   become  less<br><br>          competitive, have  fewer players,  be unable to  schedule varsity<br><br>          teams from other schools,  become unattractive to potential stars<br><br>          making college  choices, and suffer  stagnation in the  growth of<br><br>          individual talent due to  the absence of coaching.22   See Cohen,<br>                                                                 ___ _____<br><br>          809 F.

After<br><br>          hearing testimony  from Brown's Financial Vice-President  and its<br><br>          Associate Athletic Director,  the district  court concluded  that<br><br>          the cost  of the interim  injunction would be  relatively slight;<br><br>          and that, in view of discretionary funds already contained in the<br><br>          Athletic Department budget and a presidential \"contingency fund,\"<br><br>          Brown possessed the wherewithal to defray the costs without undue<br><br>          hardship.

It  is, however,  axiomatic that  a district  court,<br><br>          sitting  without a jury, may selectively discount testimony as it<br><br>          weighs  conflicting viewpoints  and adjudicates  the facts.

Summing Up.<br>                                       __________<br><br>                    We summarize succinctly, beginning with the probability<br><br>          of  plaintiffs' success.  In an era where the practices of higher<br><br>          education must  adjust to stunted revenues,  careening costs, and<br><br>          changing  demographics, colleges  might well  be obliged  to curb<br><br>          spending  on programs,  like athletics,  that do  not lie  at the<br><br>          epicenter  of their  institutional mission.    Title IX  does not<br><br>          purport to  override financial  necessity.   Yet, the  pruning of<br><br>          athletic  budgets  cannot  take  place  solely  in  comptrollers'<br><br>          offices, isolated from the legislative and regulatory imperatives<br><br>          that Title IX imposes.<br><br>                    This case aptly illustrates the point.  Brown earnestly<br><br>          professes that it has done  no more than slash women's and  men's<br><br>          athletics by  approximately the same degree, and, indeed, the raw<br><br>          numbers lend  partial credence to that  characterization.23  But,<br><br>          Brown's claim overlooks the shortcomings that plagued its program<br><br>          before it took  blade in hand.  If a  school, like Brown, eschews<br><br>          the first  two benchmarks of the accommodation  test, electing to<br><br>          stray from  substantial  proportionality  and  failing  to  march<br><br>          uninterruptedly in the direction  of equal athletic  opportunity,<br><br>          it must  comply with the third  benchmark.  To do  so, the school<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               23We note, however,  that while the  cuts proposed by  Brown<br>          eliminate a  roughly equal  number of athletic  opportunities for<br>          women as for  men, those  cuts subtract roughly  four times  more<br>          money  from  the budget  for  female pancratiasts  than  from the<br>          budget for their male counterparts.   See supra pp. 4-5.  And, as<br>                                                ___ _____<br>          a noted playwright once observed, \"where there is no money, there<br>          is no change of any kind.\"  Moss Hart, Act One (1959).<br>                                                 _______<br><br>                                          39<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          must  fully  and  effectively  accommodate  the  underrepresented<br><br>          gender's interests  and abilities,  even if  that requires  it to<br><br>          give  the  underrepresented gender  (in  this  case, women)  what<br><br>          amounts  to a  larger slice  of a  shrinking athletic-opportunity<br><br>          pie.<br><br>                    The record  reveals that the  court below paid  heed to<br><br>          these realities.  It  properly recognized that even  balanced use<br><br>          of the budget-paring knife runs afoul of Title IX where, as here,<br><br>          the  fruits  of  a  university's  athletic  program  remain  ill-<br><br>          distributed after the trimming takes place.  Because the district<br><br>          court understood this principle, and because its findings of fact<br><br>          as to  the  case's  probable  outcome are  based  on  substantial<br><br>          evidence, the court's determination that plaintiffs are likely to<br><br>          succeed on the merits is inexpugnable.<br><br>                    The  district  court  displayed  similar  dexterity  in<br><br>          touching the other three bases en  route to a grant of injunctive<br><br>          relief:    irreparability  of  injury,  the  relative  weight  of<br><br>          potential  harms, and impact on  the public interest.   The court<br><br>          found that  the harm  to  the plaintiff  class was  irremediable,<br><br>          absent  prompt  injunctive  relief;  that the  balance  of  harms<br><br>          favored such relief; and that the overriding public  interest lay<br><br>          in the firm enforcement of Title IX.   In each of these areas, as<br><br>          in  the  likelihood-of-success  arena,   the  court  made  serial<br><br>          findings  that, taken  at  face value,  amply justify  injunctive<br><br>          relief.  Because these findings derive  adequate support from the<br><br>          record, the court's  decree must  stand as long  as the  specific<br><br><br>                                          40<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          relief the court ordered  was appropriate.   It is to this  issue<br><br>          that we now turn.<br><br>          VII.  REMEDIATION<br>          VII.

Brown<br><br>          argues  that such  specific  relief is  inappropriate because  it<br><br>          intrudes on Brown's discretion.  The  point has some cogency.  We<br><br>          are a society that cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that<br><br>          universities  deserve great  leeway  in their  operations.   See,<br>                                                                       ___<br><br>          e.g., Wynne v. Tufts Univ.

In  addition,<br>          ___________<br><br>          Title  IX does not  require institutions  to fund  any particular<br><br>          number or type of athletic opportunities   only that they provide<br><br>          those opportunities  in a nondiscriminatory fashion  if they wish<br><br>          to receive federal funds.<br><br>                    Nonetheless, the district court has broad discretionary<br><br>          power to take provisional steps restoring the status quo  pending<br><br>          the conclusion of a trial.  See Ricci v. Okin, 978 F.2d  764, 767<br>                                      ___ _____    ____<br><br>          (1st Cir. 1992); Guilbert, 934 F.2d  at 7 &amp; n.3.  Considering the<br>                           ________<br><br>          district court's  proper estimation  and deft application  of the<br><br>          preliminary injunction standard, see supra Part VI, we think that<br>                                           ___ _____<br><br>          requiring Brown to maintain the women's volleyball and gymnastics<br><br>          teams in varsity status for  the time being is a remedial  choice<br><br>          within  the district  court's discretion.   That  is not  to say,<br><br><br>                                          41<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          however, that the same remedy will be suitable at trial's end  if<br><br>          the Title IX charges prove out against Brown.  The district court<br><br>          has noted, we believe appropriately, that if it  ultimately finds<br><br>          Brown's  athletic program to violate  Title IX, it will initially<br><br>          require the University to propose  a compliance plan rather  than<br><br>          mandate the  creation or  deletion of particular  athletic teams.<br><br>          Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 1001.  Although the district court has the<br>          _____<br><br>          power to  order  specific relief  if  the institution  wishes  to<br><br>          continue receiving  federal funds,  see Franklin,  112 S.  Ct. at<br>                                              ___ ________<br><br>          1035, the many routes to Title IX compliance make specific relief<br><br>          most useful in situations where the institution, after a judicial<br><br>          determination of noncompliance,  demonstrates an unwillingness or<br><br>          inability to exercise its discretion in a way that brings it into<br><br>          compliance with Title IX.<br><br>          VIII.  CONCLUSION<br>          VIII.  CONCLUSION<br><br>                    We need go  no further.   This  litigation presents  an<br><br>          array  of complicated and important issues at a crossroads of the<br><br>          law that few  courts have explored.  The beacon  by which we must<br><br>          steer is  Congress's unmistakably clear  mandate that educational<br><br>          institutions  not use  federal monies to  perpetuate gender-based<br><br>          discrimination.   At the same  time, we must  remain sensitive to<br><br>          the fact that  suits of  this genre implicate  the discretion  of<br><br>          universities  to pursue  their  missions  free from  governmental<br><br>          interference and,  in the bargain, to  deploy increasingly scarce<br><br>          resources in  the most  advantageous way.   These considerations,<br><br>          each of which is in service to desirable ends, are necessarily in<br><br><br>                                          42<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          tension in Title IX cases.  Thus, there are unlikely  to be ideal<br><br>          solutions  to  all the  vexing  problems  that might  potentially<br><br>          arise.<br><br>                    This   appeal  exemplifies  many  of  the  difficulties<br><br>          inherent in Title IX litigation.   We do not presume to  say that<br><br>          the  district court's interim solution is perfect, but it is fair<br><br>          and  it  is  lawful.    On  the  record  compiled  to  date,  the<br><br>          preliminary injunction  requiring Brown to reinstate  its women's<br><br>          volleyball  and gymnastics  teams for  the time  being came  well<br><br>          within  the encincture  of  judicial  discretion.   We  will  not<br><br>          meddle. <br><br>                    The preliminary  injunction is affirmed,  the temporary<br>                    The preliminary  injunction is affirmed,  the temporary<br>                    _______________________________________________________<br><br>          stay  is dissolved,  and the  cause is  remanded to  the district<br>          stay  is dissolved,  and the  cause is  remanded to  the district<br>          _________________________________________________________________<br><br>          court for further proceedings.

BROWN ATHLETICS:  AN OVERVIEW<br>          I.  BROWN ATHLETICS:  AN OVERVIEW<br><br>                    College  athletics,   particularly  in  the   realm  of<br><br>          football and basketball,  has traditionally occupied  a prominent<br><br>          role  in  American  sports  and American  society.    For college<br><br>          students, athletics offers an  opportunity to exacuate leadership<br><br>          skills, learn teamwork, build  self-confidence, and perfect self-<br><br>          discipline.    In addition,  for many  student-athletes, physical<br><br>          skills  are a  passport to  college admissions  and scholarships,<br><br>          allowing them  to attend  otherwise inaccessible schools.   These<br><br>          opportunities, and the lessons learned on the playing fields, are<br><br>          invaluable in attaining career  and life successes in and  out of<br><br>          professional sports.<br><br>                    The  highway of  opportunity runs  in both  directions.<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               1The individual defendants are, respectively,  the President<br>          and  Athletic Director of  the University.   Each is  sued in his<br>          official capacity.  For ease in reference, we discuss this appeal<br>          as if Brown was  the sole defendant and appellant.

Successful teams generate<br><br>          television   revenues   and  gate   receipts  which   often  fund<br><br>          significant   percentages  of  a  university's  overall  athletic<br><br>          program, offering  students the opportunity to  partake of sports<br><br>          that   are   not  financially   self-sustaining.     Even   those<br><br>          institutions whose teams do not fill the grandstands of cavernous<br><br>          stadiums  or attract  national television  exposure benefit  from<br><br>          increased  student  and  alumni   cohesion  and  the  support  it<br><br>          engenders.   Thus,  universities  nurture the  legends, great  or<br><br>          small, inhering  in their  athletic past, polishing  the hardware<br><br>          that adorns field-house trophy cases and reliving heroic exploits<br><br>          in the pages of alumni magazines.<br><br>                    In these terms, Brown will never be confused with Notre<br><br>          Dame or the  more muscular members of the Big  Ten.  Although its<br><br>          football  team did  play  in the  1916 Rose  Bowl  and its  men's<br><br>          basketball  team won the  Ivy League championship  as recently as<br><br>          1986, Brown's  athletic  program has  only occasionally  achieved<br><br>          national  prominence  or,  for  that  matter,  enjoyed  sustained<br><br>          success.2  Moreover,  at Brown, as  at most schools, women  are a<br><br>          relatively  inconspicuous part  of  the  storied  athletic  past.<br><br>          Historically,  colleges limited  athletics  to  the male  sphere,<br><br>          leaving  those few women's  teams that  sprouted to  scrounge for<br><br>          resources.<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               2We note, not without a certain irony, that  the now-demoted<br>          women's   volleyball  and   gymnastics   teams  won   Ivy  League<br>          championships in 1988 and 1990, respectively.<br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    The absence  of women's  athletics at Brown  was, until<br><br>          1970, an ineluctable  consequence of the absence  of women; Brown<br><br>          sponsored a women's college   Pembroke   but did not itself admit<br><br>          women.    In 1971,  Brown  subsumed  Pembroke.    Brown  promptly<br><br>          upgraded Pembroke's  rather primitive athletic  offerings so that<br><br>          by 1977 there were fourteen women's varsity teams.  In subsequent<br><br>          years, Brown  added only one distaff team:  winter track.  Hence,<br><br>          in  the  1991-92 academic  year,  Brown  fielded fifteen  women's<br><br>          varsity teams   one fewer than the number of men's varsity teams.<br><br>          II.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS<br>          II.  THE PLAINTIFF CLASS<br><br>                    In the  spring of 1991,  Brown announced that  it, like<br><br>          many other schools, was in a financial bind, and that, as a belt-<br><br>          tightening  measure,  it planned  to  drop four  sports  from its<br><br>          intercollegiate varsity  athletic roster:  women's volleyball and<br><br>          gymnastics, men's  golf and water polo.  The University permitted<br><br>          the  teams  to continue  playing  as  \"intercollegiate clubs,\"  a<br><br>          status  that allowed them  to compete against  varsity teams from<br><br>          other  colleges,3 but  cut  off financial  subsidies and  support<br><br>          services  routinely available  to  varsity teams  (e.g., salaried<br>                                                             ____<br><br>          coaches, access  to prime  facilities,  preferred practice  time,<br><br>          medical trainers, clerical  assistance, office support, admission<br><br>          preferences,  and the  like).   Brown estimated  that eliminating<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               3As a practical matter, many schools with varsity squads are<br>          reluctant  to  compete  against  club teams.    This  case  aptly<br>          illustrates  the point.   As  soon as  Brown demoted  its women's<br>          volleyball  team  from  varsity   to  club  status,  Northeastern<br>          University and  West Point  declined to include  Brown on  future<br>          volleyball schedules.

Thus,  women  had  36.7%  of the  athletic<br><br>          opportunities and men  63.3%.  Abolishing the four  varsity teams<br><br>          took substantially more dollars  from the women's athletic budget<br><br>          than from the  men's budget,  but did not  materially affect  the<br><br>          athletic   opportunity  ratios;  women   retained  36.6%  of  the<br><br>          opportunities and men  63.4%.  At that time (and  for a number of<br><br>          years    prior   thereto),   Brown's   student   body   comprised<br><br>          approximately 52% men and 48% women.<br><br>                    Following   Brown's   announcement  of   the  cutbacks,<br><br>          disappointed  members of  the women's  volleyball and  gymnastics<br><br>          teams brought suit.

The<br><br>          gridiron  fueled these  concerns:   for many  schools, the  men's<br><br>          football budget far exceeded  that of any other sport,  and men's<br><br>          athletics  as  a whole  received  the lion's  share  of dedicated<br><br>          resources   a share  that, typically, was vastly disproportionate<br><br>          to the percentage of men in the student body.<br><br>                    Part of the  confusion about  the scope  of Title  IX's<br><br>          coverage  and the acceptable avenues of compliance arose from the<br><br>          absence of secondary legislative materials.  Congress included no<br><br>          committee report with  the final bill  and there were  apparently<br><br>          only   two  mentions  of  intercollegiate  athletics  during  the<br><br>          congressional debate.

After listing  a number of  exempt<br><br>          organizations,  section 1681  makes  clear that,  while Title  IX<br><br>          prohibits  discrimination, it  does not mandate  strict numerical<br><br>          equality  between  the gender  balance  of  a college's  athletic<br><br>          program  and the  gender  balance of  its  student body.    Thus,<br><br>          section 1681(a) shall not<br><br>                    be  interpreted  to  require any  educational<br>                    institution   to    grant   preferential   or<br>                    disparate treatment to the members of one sex<br>                    on account  of an  imbalance which  may exist<br>                    with  respect   to   the  total   number   or<br>                    percentage   of   persons    of   that    sex<br>                    participating in or receiving the benefits of<br>                    any federally supported program  or activity,<br>                    in   comparison  with  the  total  number  or<br>                    percentage of  persons  of that  sex  in  any<br>                    community,  State,  section,  or other  area:<br>                    Provided, That this  subsection shall not  be<br>                    ________<br>                    construed to prevent the consideration in any<br>                    hearing  or proceeding under  this chapter of<br>                    statistical  evidence  tending  to show  that<br>                    such an  imbalance exists with respect to the<br>                    participation in, or receipt of  the benefits<br>                    of,  any  such  program or  activity  by  the<br>                    members of one sex.<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               6This lacuna apparently results from a political compromise.<br>          After the Conference Committee  deleted an amendment to  Title IX<br>          that would have  exempted \"revenue-producing\" athletics, Congress<br>          asked the  Secretary of  HEW to provide  regulations specifically<br>          governing athletics.  See 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (1979).<br>                                ___<br><br>                                          10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          20 U.S.C.    1681(b) (1988).  Put another  way, a court assessing<br><br>          Title IX compliance may not find a violation solely because there<br>                                                       ______<br><br>          is  a disparity between the gender  composition of an educational<br><br>          institution's  student constituency,  on  the one  hand, and  its<br><br>          athletic programs, on the other hand.<br><br>                    That  is not to say,  however, that evidence  of such a<br><br>          disparity  is irrelevant.  Quite the contrary:  under the proviso<br><br>          contained in section 1681(b), a Title IX plaintiff in an athletic<br><br>          discrimination  suit  must   accompany  statistical  evidence  of<br><br>          disparate impact with  some further  evidence of  discrimination,<br><br>          such as unmet needamongst the members of thedisadvantaged gender.<br><br>                              C.

See  40 Fed.  Reg. 24,128<br>                                __________        ___<br><br>          (1975).    Thereafter,  in  1979,  Congress split  HEW  into  the<br><br>          Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department<br><br>          of Education  (DED).  See  20 U.S.C.     3401-3510 (1988).   In a<br>                                ___<br><br>          wonderful example  of bureaucratic muddle, the  existing Title IX<br><br>          regulations were  left within  HHS's arsenal  while, at  the same<br><br>          time,  DED  replicated  them  as  part  of  its   own  regulatory<br><br>          armamentarium.   Compare 45 C.F.R.    86 (1992) (HHS regulations)<br>                           _______<br><br>          with 34  C.F.R.    106 (1992) (DED  regulations).   Both sets  of<br>          ____<br><br>          regulations were still in effect when the Restoration Act passed.<br><br>          They  are  identical,  save  only  for  changes  in  nomenclature<br><br>          reflecting the reorganization of the federal bureaucracy.<br><br><br>                                          11<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In short, like pretenders to the emirate of a  deceased<br><br>          sheik, both HHS  and DED  lay an hereditary  claim to this  oasis<br><br>          which arises  from the regulatory desert,  asserting authority to<br><br>          enforce  Title IX.  Nevertheless,  DED is the  principle locus of<br><br>          ongoing  enforcement  activity.    See  20  U.S.C.     3441(a)(1)<br>                                             ___<br><br>          (transferring all education functions of HEW to DED); see also 20<br>                                                                ___ ____<br><br>          U.S.C.   3441(a)(3) (transferring  education-related OCR work  to<br><br>          DED).   Therefore, like the parties, we treat DED, acting through<br><br>          its OCR, as the  administrative agency charged with administering<br><br>          Title IX.7<br><br>                    Recognizing  the agency's role  has important practical<br><br>          and legal  consequences.   Although DED is  not a  party to  this<br><br>          appeal, we must accord its interpretation of Title IX appreciable<br><br>          deference.  See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.

The  regulations  offer  a  non-exclusive<br><br>          compendium of ten  factors which OCR  will consider in  assessing<br><br>          compliance with this mandate:<br><br>                         (1) Whether the  selection of sports and<br>                    levels of competition effectively accommodate<br>                    the  interests  and abilities  of  members of<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               8The regulations provide:<br><br>                    No  person shall,  on  the basis  of sex,  be<br>                    excluded from participation in, be denied the<br>                    benefits  of,  be  treated  differently  from<br>                    another person or otherwise  be discriminated<br>                    against      in      any     interscholastic,<br>                    intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics<br>                    offered  by  a  recipient,  and  no recipient<br>                    shall provide any  such athletics  separately<br>                    on such basis.<br><br>          34 C.F.R.   106.41(a) (1992).<br><br>                                          13<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    both sexes;<br>                         (2)  The  provision  of   equipment  and<br>                    supplies;<br>                         (3)  Scheduling  of  games and  practice<br>                    time;<br>                         (4) Travel and per diem allowance;<br>                         (5) Opportunity to receive  coaching and<br>                    academic tutoring;<br>                         (6)   Assignment  and   compensation  of<br>                    coaches and tutors;<br>                         (7) Provision of locker  rooms, practice<br>                    and competitive facilities;<br>                         (8)  Provision  of medical  and training<br>                    facilities and services;<br>                         (9)  Provision  of  housing  and  dining<br>                    facilities and services;<br>                         (10) Publicity.<br><br>          34 C.F.R.    106.41(c) (1992).9   The district  court rested  its<br><br>          preliminary  injunction  on  the  first of  these  ten  areas  of<br><br>          inquiry:     Brown's  failure  effectively   to  accommodate  the<br><br>          interests  and abilities of female  students in the selection and<br><br>          level of sports.

In  surveying  the dimensions  of this<br><br>          battleground, that  is, whether an  athletic program  effectively<br><br>          accommodates   students'  interests  and  abilities,  the  Policy<br><br>          Interpretation  maps   a  trinitarian   model  under  which   the<br><br>          university must meet at least one of three benchmarks:<br><br>                         (1)   Whether   intercollegiate    level<br>                    participation  opportunities   for  male  and<br>                    female  students  are  provided   in  numbers<br>                    substantially    proportionate    to    their<br>                    respective enrollments; or<br>                         (2) Where  the members  of one  sex have<br>                    been    and   are    underrepresented   among<br>                    intercollegiate    athletes,   whether    the<br>                    institution can show a history and continuing<br>                    practice  of  program   expansion  which   is<br>                    demonstrably  responsive  to  the  developing<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               12In any  event, both the financial  assistance and athletic<br>          equivalence standards are inapposite for present purposes.

Reg.  at 71,418.   The first benchmark  furnishes a safe<br><br>          harbor  for those  institutions  that  have distributed  athletic<br><br>          opportunities  in numbers  \"substantially  proportionate\" to  the<br><br>          gender composition  of their student bodies.   Thus, a university<br><br>          which does  not wish to  engage in extensive  compliance analysis<br><br>          may stay  on the  sunny side of  Title IX  simply by  maintaining<br><br>          gender parity between its student body and its athletic lineup.<br><br><br><br>                    The second  and third  parts of the  accommodation test<br><br>          recognize  that  there  are   circumstances  under  which,  as  a<br><br>          practical matter,  something short  of this proportionality  is a<br><br>          satisfactory proxy for gender balance.  For example, so long as a<br><br>          university is continually expanding athletic opportunities in  an<br><br>          ongoing effort to meet the  needs of the underrepresented gender,<br><br>          and persists in this  approach as interest and ability  levels in<br><br>          its student body and secondary feeder schools rise, benchmark two<br><br>          is  satisfied and Title IX  does not require  that the university<br><br>          leap  to complete  gender parity  in a  single bound.   Or,  if a<br><br>          school has a student body  in which one sex is demonstrably  less<br><br>          interested in  athletics,  Title IX  does  not require  that  the<br><br><br>                                          18<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          school  create   teams  for,   or  rain  money   upon,  otherwise<br><br>          disinterested students; rather, the  third benchmark is satisfied<br><br>          if the underrepresented sex's discernible interests are fully and<br><br>          effectively accommodated.13<br><br>                    It seems unlikely, even  in this day and age,  that the<br><br>          athletic  establishments  of   many  coeducational   universities<br><br>          reflect   the   gender   balance  of   their   student  bodies.14<br><br>          Similarly, the recent boom in Title IX suits suggests that, in an<br><br>          era of  fiscal austerity,  few universities  are prone  to expand<br><br>          athletic opportunities.  It is not surprising, then, that schools<br><br>          more often than not attempt  to manage the rigors of Title  IX by<br><br>          satisfying the  interests and abilities  of the  underrepresented<br><br>          gender,   that  is,  by  meeting   the  third  benchmark  of  the<br><br>          accommodation  test.  Yet,  this benchmark sets  a high standard:<br><br>          it demands  not merely some accommodation, but full and effective<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               13OCR also lists a series of illustrative justifications for<br>          the  disparate treatment  of  men's and  women's athletic  teams,<br>          including (1) sports  that require more resources  because of the<br>          nature of the game (e.g.,  contact sports generally require  more<br>                              ____<br>          equipment),  (2)  special circumstances,  such  as  an influx  of<br>          first-year players, that may require an extraordinary infusion of<br>          resources,  (3) special operational expenses (e.g., crowd control<br>                                                        ____<br>          at  a  basketball tournament),  as  long  as special  operational<br>          expense needs  are  met  for  both genders  and  (4)  affirmative<br>          measures to remedy past limitations on athletic opportunities for<br>          one gender.  44 Fed.

If there is sufficient interest and ability among<br><br>          members of the statistically  underrepresented gender, not slaked<br><br>          by existing programs, an institution necessarily fails this prong<br><br>          of the test.<br><br>                    Although the  full-and-effective-accommodation standard<br><br>          is  high,  it  is   not  absolute.    Even  when   male  athletic<br><br>          opportunities  outnumber female  athletic opportunities,  and the<br><br>          university  has   not  met   the  first   benchmark  (substantial<br><br>          statistical proportionality) or  the second benchmark (continuing<br><br>          program expansion) of the accommodation test, the mere fact  that<br><br>          there are some  female students  interested in a  sport does  not<br><br>          ipso facto require the school to provide a varsity team in  order<br>          ____ _____<br><br>          to  comply with the third benchmark.  Rather, the institution can<br><br>          satisfy   the   third   benchmark   by   ensuring   participatory<br><br>          opportunities  at  the intercollegiate  level  when,  and to  the<br><br>          extent that, there is \"sufficient interest  and ability among the<br><br>          members  of the  excluded  sex to  sustain  a viable  team and  a<br><br>          reasonable  expectation of  intercollegiate competition  for that<br><br>          team .  . . .\"   44 Fed.

Brown  suggests that, to<br><br>          the extent students' interests in athletics are  disproportionate<br><br>          by  gender, colleges  should be  allowed to meet  those interests<br><br>          incompletely  as  long  as the  school's  response  is in  direct<br><br>          proportion to the  comparative levels of interest.   Put bluntly,<br><br>          Brown reads the \"full\" out of the duty to accommodate  \"fully and<br><br>          effectively.\"      It   argues   instead  that   an   institution<br><br>          satisfactorily  accommodates  female  athletes  if  it  allocates<br><br>          athletic  opportunities to women in accordance  with the ratio of<br>                                           ________________________________<br><br>          interested and able  women to interested and able men, regardless<br>          _____________________________________________________<br><br>          of the number of unserved women or the  percentage of the student<br><br>          body that they comprise.<br><br>                    Because  this is  mountainous terrain,  an example  may<br><br>          serve to clarify the distinction between Brown's proposal and our<br><br>          understanding of the law.   Suppose a university (Oooh U.)  has a<br><br>          student body  consisting of 1,000 men  and 1,000 women, a  one to<br><br>          one ratio.   If 500  men and  250 women are  able and  interested<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               15If  in  the  course  of  adding  and  upgrading  teams,  a<br>          university attains gender parity between its athletic program and<br>          its  student   body,  it  meets   the  first  benchmark   of  the<br>          accommodation test.  But, Title IX does not require that a school<br>          pour ever-increasing sums into its athletic establishment.  If  a<br>          university  prefers to  take  another route,  it  can also  bring<br>          itself  into   compliance  with   the  first  benchmark   of  the<br>          accommodation test  by subtraction  and downgrading, that  is, by<br>          reducing  opportunities  for  the  overrepresented  gender  while<br>          keeping opportunities stable for the underrepresented gender  (or<br>          reducing them to a much lesser extent).<br><br>                                          21<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          athletes,  the ratio of interested men to interested women is two<br><br>          to one.   Brown takes  the position that  both the actual  gender<br><br>          composition of  the  student  body  and whether  there  is  unmet<br><br>          interest among  the  underrepresented gender  are irrelevant;  in<br><br>          order to satisfy the  third benchmark, Oooh U. must  only provide<br><br>          athletic  opportunities in  line with  the two to  one interested<br><br>          athlete  ratio, say,  100 slots for  men and 50  slots for women.<br><br>          Under this view, the interest  of 200 women would be unmet    but<br><br>          there would be no Title IX violation.<br><br>                    We  think  that  Brown's  perception of  the  Title  IX<br><br>          universe  is myopic.  The fact that the overrepresented gender is<br><br>          less than fully accommodated will not, in and of itself, excuse a<br><br>          shortfall   in   the   provision   of   opportunities   for   the<br><br>          underrepresented gender.  Rather, the  law requires that, in  the<br><br>          absence of continuing program  expansion (benchmark two), schools<br><br>          either meet benchmark one  by providing athletic opportunities in<br><br>          proportion to the gender composition of the student body (in Oooh<br><br>          U.'s case, a roughly equal number  of slots for men and women, as<br><br>          the  student body is equally divided), or meet benchmark three by<br><br>          fully    accommodating    interested    athletes     among    the<br><br>          underrepresented  sex  (providing,  at  Oooh U.,  250  slots  for<br><br>          women).16<br><br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               16Of  course, if Oooh U. takes the benchmark three route, it<br>          will also have to provide  at least the same number of  slots for<br>          men; but, so long as women remain the underrepresented gender and<br>          their  interests  are  fully  accommodated,  the  university  can<br>          provide as many (or as  few) additional slots for men as  it sees<br>          fit.<br><br>                                          22<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>                    In  the final  analysis, Brown's view  is wrong  on two<br><br>          scores.   It  is wrong  as  a matter  of  law, for  DED's  Policy<br><br>          Interpretation,   which  requires   full  accommodation   of  the<br><br>          underrepresented gender,  draws  its essence  from  the  statute.<br><br>          Whether  Brown's concept  might  be thought  more attractive,  or<br><br>          whether  we, if  writing  on a  pristine  page, would  craft  the<br><br>          regulation  in a manner different  than the agency,  are not very<br><br>          important considerations.

Given that the survey of  interests and abilities<br><br>          would begin under circumstances where men's athletic teams have a<br><br>          considerable head start, such a rule would almost certainly blunt<br><br>          the  exhortation  that  schools  should \"take  into  account  the<br><br>          nationally increasing levels of women's  interests and abilities\"<br><br>          and avoid \"disadvantag[ing] members  of an underrepresented sex .<br><br>          . . .\"  44 Fed.

Student plaintiffs, who  carry the burden  of proof on this<br><br>          issue, as well as  universities monitoring self-compliance, would<br><br>          be required  to assess the level of interest in both the male and<br><br>          female  student  populations   and  determine  comparatively  how<br><br>          completely the university was serving the interests of each  sex.<br><br>          By contrast, as we read the accommodation test's third benchmark,<br><br>          it requires  a relatively simple  assessment of whether  there is<br><br>          unmet need in the  underrepresented gender that rises to  a level<br><br>          sufficient to warrant a new team or the upgrading of an  existing<br><br>          team.  We think the simpler reading is far more serviceable.<br><br>                    Furthermore, by moving away from OCR's third benchmark,<br><br>          which focuses on the levels of interest and ability extant in the<br><br><br>                                          24<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          student body,  Brown's theory invites thorny questions  as to the<br><br>          appropriate  survey  population,  whether  from  the  university,<br><br>          typical  feeder schools, or the regional community.

In such a setting, the men's athletic program  may well<br>          be  underdeveloped,   or  underfunded,  or   both,  while  fiscal<br>          retrenchment  offers no  reprieve.

In  the  absence  of  any  proof<br><br>          supporting  Brown's  claim,  and  in view  of  congressional  and<br><br>          administrative urging  that women,  given  the opportunity,  will<br><br>          naturally participate in athletics in numbers equal to men, we do<br><br>          not find  that  the regulation,  when  read in  the  common-sense<br><br>          manner  that its  language  suggests, see  supra Part  III(C)(3),<br>                                                ___  _____<br><br>          offends the Fifth Amendment.<br><br>                    What is more, even if we were to assume, for argument's<br><br>          sake, that the regulation creates a gender classification slanted<br><br>          somewhat  in  favor of  women,  we would  find  no constitutional<br><br>          infirmity.

The  court<br><br>          plainly  visualized  both  the  factual   intricacies  and  legal<br><br>          complexities that  characterize Title IX  litigation.

Cognizant, perhaps, that  the raw<br>          _____<br><br>          numbers tell an  unambiguous tale, Brown  does not challenge  the<br><br>          inviolability of this finding.<br><br>                    As  to the  test's second  part, the court  below found<br><br>          that, although Brown  could point to  \"impressive growth\" in  its<br><br>          women's athletic  program  in  the  1970s,  the  school  had  not<br><br><br>                                          32<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          continued  filling the gap during the next  two decades.

See id.  Brown asserts that  the district court erred<br>                      ___ ___<br><br>          by not crediting  it sufficiently for  its dramatic expansion  of<br><br>          women's   sports  in  the   1970s,  and   we  are   not  entirely<br><br>          unsympathetic  to this plea.  In the last analysis, however, this<br><br>          was  a judgment  call  and the  trial  court's judgment  was  not<br><br>          unreasonable.   While a university deserves  appreciable applause<br><br>          for  supercharging a  low-voltage athletic  program in  one burst<br><br>          rather  than powering  it  up  over  a  longer  period,  such  an<br><br>          energization,   once  undertaken,  does   not  forever  hold  the<br><br>          institution harmless.  Here, Brown labored for six years to weave<br><br>          a broad array of new activities into the fabric of its palestrian<br><br>          offerings.  The district court apparently believed, however, that<br><br>          Brown  then rested on its  laurels for at  least twice that long.<br><br>          The very length of this hiatus  suggests something far short of a<br><br>          continuing  practice  of program  expansion.    And, moreover,  a<br>          __________<br><br>          university must design expansion in whatever form and at whatever<br><br>          pace to respond  to the  flux and reflux  of unserved  interests.<br><br>          The court  below found that Brown  failed in this task.   See id.<br>                                                                    ___ ___<br><br>          The  issue  of  responsiveness  is  fact-intensive  and  in  most<br><br>          instances, as  here, its  resolution will  be within the  trier's<br><br>          province.  We find  no error, therefore, in the  district court's<br><br>          resolution of the second aspect of the accommodation test.<br><br>                    The  third  benchmark   presents  a  more   problematic<br><br>          scenario.   The district  court incorrectly held  that Brown bore<br><br><br>                                          33<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          the  burden  of  showing  that  it  had  fully  and   effectively<br><br>          accommodated the  interests and abilities of  its women athletes.<br><br>          See  id. at 997.   Section 1681(b) requires  that the plaintiffs,<br>          ___  ___<br><br>          rather than the  University, prove  a shortfall in  the full  and<br><br>          effective accommodation of interested female athletes by showing,<br><br>          initially,  both numerical  disparity  and unmet  interest.   See<br>                                                                        ___<br><br>          supra Part  V.   Nonetheless, we  do not think  that the  court's<br>          _____<br><br>          bevue is  fatal.  Even  when a  trial court has  misconstrued the<br><br>          law, an appellate tribunal  may avoid remanding if the  record is<br><br>          sufficiently  developed  and the  facts  necessary  to shape  the<br><br>          proper legal matrix  are sufficiently clear.

The court  found, for  example,<br><br>          that there was \"great interest and talent\" amongst Brown's female<br><br>          undergraduates  which,  following  the cuts,  would  go unserved.<br><br>          Cohen, 809 F.

Because the record  contains nothing that  would allow a<br><br>          trier to find that Brown's athletic agenda reflects the makeup of<br><br>          its  student  body  or that  the  plaintiff  class  is so  poorly<br><br>          populated as  to warrant  a reduction  in  women's sports,21  the<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               21It  bears mentioning  in  this regard  that Judge  Pettine<br>          heard, and  apparently credited, evidence  indicating that  there<br>          were  other  women's  club teams  sufficiently  accomplished  and<br><br>                                          35<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          court's  error was harmless.

The<br><br>          district court  heard from  a variety of  athletic administration<br><br>          experts.  The court concluded that, absent judicial intervention,<br><br>          the plaintiffs would suffer irremediable injury in at least three<br><br>          respects:    competitive   posture,  recruitment,  and   loss  of<br><br>          coaching.   As  club teams,  the district  court thought  women's<br><br>          volleyball   and  gymnastics   would  increasingly   become  less<br><br>          competitive, have  fewer players,  be unable to  schedule varsity<br><br>          teams from other schools,  become unattractive to potential stars<br><br>          making college  choices, and suffer  stagnation in the  growth of<br><br>          individual talent due to  the absence of coaching.22   See Cohen,<br>                                                                 ___ _____<br><br>          809 F.

After<br><br>          hearing testimony  from Brown's Financial Vice-President  and its<br><br>          Associate Athletic Director,  the district  court concluded  that<br><br>          the cost  of the interim  injunction would be  relatively slight;<br><br>          and that, in view of discretionary funds already contained in the<br><br>          Athletic Department budget and a presidential \"contingency fund,\"<br><br>          Brown possessed the wherewithal to defray the costs without undue<br><br>          hardship.

In an era where the practices of higher<br><br>          education must  adjust to stunted revenues,  careening costs, and<br><br>          changing  demographics, colleges  might well  be obliged  to curb<br><br>          spending  on programs,  like athletics,  that do  not lie  at the<br><br>          epicenter  of their  institutional mission.    Title IX  does not<br><br>          purport to  override financial  necessity.   Yet, the  pruning of<br><br>          athletic  budgets  cannot  take  place  solely  in  comptrollers'<br><br>          offices, isolated from the legislative and regulatory imperatives<br><br>          that Title IX imposes.<br><br>                    This case aptly illustrates the point.  Brown earnestly<br><br>          professes that it has done  no more than slash women's and  men's<br><br>          athletics by  approximately the same degree, and, indeed, the raw<br><br>          numbers lend  partial credence to that  characterization.23  But,<br><br>          Brown's claim overlooks the shortcomings that plagued its program<br><br>          before it took  blade in hand.  If a  school, like Brown, eschews<br><br>          the first  two benchmarks of the accommodation  test, electing to<br><br>          stray from  substantial  proportionality  and  failing  to  march<br><br>          uninterruptedly in the direction  of equal athletic  opportunity,<br><br>          it must  comply with the third  benchmark.  To do  so, the school<br>                              <br>          ____________________<br><br>               23We note, however,  that while the  cuts proposed by  Brown<br>          eliminate a  roughly equal  number of athletic  opportunities for<br>          women as for  men, those  cuts subtract roughly  four times  more<br>          money  from  the budget  for  female pancratiasts  than  from the<br>          budget for their male counterparts.

It  properly recognized that even  balanced use<br><br>          of the budget-paring knife runs afoul of Title IX where, as here,<br><br>          the  fruits  of  a  university's  athletic  program  remain  ill-<br><br>          distributed after the trimming takes place.  Because the district<br><br>          court understood this principle, and because its findings of fact<br><br>          as to  the  case's  probable  outcome are  based  on  substantial<br><br>          evidence, the court's determination that plaintiffs are likely to<br><br>          succeed on the merits is inexpugnable.<br><br>                    The  district  court  displayed  similar  dexterity  in<br><br>          touching the other three bases en  route to a grant of injunctive<br><br>          relief:    irreparability  of  injury,  the  relative  weight  of<br><br>          potential  harms, and impact on  the public interest.   The court<br><br>          found that  the harm  to  the plaintiff  class was  irremediable,<br><br>          absent  prompt  injunctive  relief;  that the  balance  of  harms<br><br>          favored such relief; and that the overriding public  interest lay<br><br>          in the firm enforcement of Title IX.   In each of these areas, as<br><br>          in  the  likelihood-of-success  arena,   the  court  made  serial<br><br>          findings  that, taken  at  face value,  amply justify  injunctive<br><br>          relief.  Because these findings derive  adequate support from the<br><br>          record, the court's  decree must  stand as long  as the  specific<br><br><br>                                          40<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          relief the court ordered  was appropriate.   It is to this  issue<br><br>          that we now turn.<br><br>          VII.  REMEDIATION<br>          VII.  REMEDIATION<br><br>                    After applying the preliminary injunction standard, the<br><br>          district   court  ordered   relief  pendente   lite,  temporarily<br>                                              ________   ____<br><br>          reinstating the  women's volleyball and gymnastics  teams.  Brown<br><br>          argues  that such  specific  relief is  inappropriate because  it<br><br>          intrudes on Brown's discretion.  The  point has some cogency.  We<br><br>          are a society that cherishes academic freedom and recognizes that<br><br>          universities  deserve great  leeway  in their  operations.   See,<br>                                                                       ___<br><br>          e.g., Wynne v. Tufts Univ.

In  addition,<br>          ___________<br><br>          Title  IX does not  require institutions  to fund  any particular<br><br>          number or type of athletic opportunities   only that they provide<br><br>          those opportunities  in a nondiscriminatory fashion  if they wish<br><br>          to receive federal funds.<br><br>                    Nonetheless, the district court has broad discretionary<br><br>          power to take provisional steps restoring the status quo  pending<br><br>          the conclusion of a trial.  See Ricci v. Okin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593907\"><a href=\"/opinion/593907/robert-simpson-ricci-v-robert-l-okin-md-william-f-weld-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, 767<br>                                      ___ _____    ____<br><br>          (1st Cir. 1992); Guilbert, 934 F.2d  at 7 &amp; n.3.  Considering the<br>                           ________<br><br>          district court's  proper estimation  and deft application  of the<br><br>          preliminary injunction standard, see supra Part VI, we think that<br>                                           ___ _____<br><br>          requiring Brown to maintain the women's volleyball and gymnastics<br><br>          teams in varsity status for  the time being is a remedial  choice<br><br>          within  the district  court's discretion.   That  is not  to say,<br><br><br>                                          41<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          however, that the same remedy will be suitable at trial's end  if<br><br>          the Title IX charges prove out against Brown.  The district court<br><br>          has noted, we believe appropriately, that if it  ultimately finds<br><br>          Brown's  athletic program to violate  Title IX, it will initially<br><br>          require the University to propose  a compliance plan rather  than<br><br>          mandate the  creation or  deletion of particular  athletic teams.<br><br>          Cohen, 809 F. Supp. at 1001.  Although the district court has the<br>          _____<br><br>          power to  order  specific relief  if  the institution  wishes  to<br><br>          continue receiving  federal funds,  see Franklin,  112 S.  Ct. at<br>                                              ___ ________<br><br>          1035, the many routes to Title IX compliance make specific relief<br><br>          most useful in situations where the institution, after a judicial<br><br>          determination of noncompliance,  demonstrates an unwillingness or<br><br>          inability to exercise its discretion in a way that brings it into<br><br>          compliance with Title IX.<br><br>          VIII.  CONCLUSION<br>          VIII.  CONCLUSION<br><br>                    We need go  no further.   This  litigation presents  an<br><br>          array  of complicated and important issues at a crossroads of the<br><br>          law that few  courts have explored.  The beacon  by which we must<br><br>          steer is  Congress's unmistakably clear  mandate that educational<br><br>          institutions  not use  federal monies to  perpetuate gender-based<br><br>          discrimination.   At the same  time, we must  remain sensitive to<br><br>          the fact that  suits of  this genre implicate  the discretion  of<br><br>          universities  to pursue  their  missions  free from  governmental<br><br>          interference and,  in the bargain, to  deploy increasingly scarce<br><br>          resources in  the most  advantageous way.   These considerations,<br><br>          each of which is in service to desirable ends, are necessarily in<br><br><br>                                          42<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          tension in Title IX cases.  Thus, there are unlikely  to be ideal<br><br>          solutions  to  all the  vexing  problems  that might  potentially<br><br>          arise.<br><br>                    This   appeal  exemplifies  many  of  the  difficulties<br><br>          inherent in Title IX litigation.   We do not presume to  say that<br><br>          the  district court's interim solution is perfect, but it is fair<br><br>          and  it  is  lawful.    On  the  record  compiled  to  date,  the<br><br>          preliminary injunction  requiring Brown to reinstate  its women's<br><br>          volleyball  and gymnastics  teams for  the time  being came  well<br><br>          within  the encincture  of  judicial  discretion.   We  will  not<br><br>          meddle. <br><br>                    The preliminary  injunction is affirmed,  the temporary<br>                    The preliminary  injunction is affirmed,  the temporary<br>                    _______________________________________________________<br><br>          stay  is dissolved,  and the  cause is  remanded to  the district<br>          stay  is dissolved,  and the  cause is  remanded to  the district<br>          _________________________________________________________________<br><br>          court for further proceedings.
