In seeking to promote the public’s legitimate interest in transparent\n\ngovernment, the Act imposes considerable disclosure obligations on “governmental bod[ies].”\n\nImportantly, the statutory definition of “governmental body” extends only to “the part, section, or\n\nportion of an organization, corporation, commission, committee, institution, or agency that spends\n\nor that is supported in whole or in part by public funds.”                 See TEX . GOV ’T CODE\n\n§ 552.003(1)(A)(xii) (emphasis added). This operates to prevent nominally private entities whose\n\nwork might otherwise qualify them as de facto public agencies from circumventing the Act’s\n\fdisclosure requirements. This case requires us to decide whether the term “supported” encompasses\n\nprivate entities contracting at arm’s length with the government to provide general and specific\n\nservices or whether the term properly includes only those entities that could not perform similar\n\nservices without public funds and, are thus, sustained—in whole or part—by such funds.\n\n        When a private entity enters into a contract and receives government funds in exchange for\n\nits services, the entity’s right to conduct its affairs confidentially may be in tension with the public’s\n\nright to know how government funds are spent. Transparency, openness, and accountability in the\n\ngovernment are all of fundamental importance. However, these important policy objectives cannot\n\nextinguish the privacy rights properly belonging to private business entities in Texas. By liberally\n\nauthorizing public access to government records while simultaneously shielding private business\n\nfrom unwarranted interference, the Legislature carefully balanced these conflicting interests.\n\nMindful of the delicate equilibrium between these equally compelling concerns, we conclude that\n\nthe term “supported,” which helps define the breadth of the Act, unambiguously includes only those\n\nentities at least partially sustained by public funding.          Because the statutory language is\n\nunambiguous, we need not consider the accuracy or vitality of the test articulated in Kneeland v.\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 850 F.2d 224 (5th Cir. 1988), which the Attorney General’s Open\n\nRecords Division has traditionally applied to private entities in cases involving open-record requests.\n\n        Here, Greater Houston Partnership, a nonprofit corporation providing economic-development\n\nservices to the City and other clients pursuant to quid pro quo contracts, contests whether it is a\n\n“governmental body” in whole or in part. Applying Kneeland, the Attorney General and lower\n\ncourts held that it is. We hold, however, that Greater Houston Partnership is not a “governmental\n\nbody” under the Texas Public Information Act because it is not wholly or partially sustained by\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fpublic funds; we therefore reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment for Greater\n\nHouston Partnership.\n\n                            I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Greater Houston Partnership (GHP) is a private, nonprofit corporation that promotes regional\n\neconomic growth and an attractive business climate for a ten-county area centered around Houston,\n\nTexas. GHP’s stated purpose is to enhance economic prosperity, facilitate business relocation and\n\nexpansion, encourage international outreach initiatives, and provide strategic planning to advocate\n\nfor “the improvement of commercial, industrial, agricultural, civic, and cultural affairs” in the\n\nHouston region. In furtherance of this objective, GHP provides consulting, event planning, and\n\nmarketing services (including advertising and market research) to its roughly 2,100 member\n\ncompanies on a contractual basis.      GHP also hosts numerous networking and professional\n\ndevelopment events, including several weekly GHP Council meetings on topics relevant to the\n\nregional economy. GHP operates on an annual budget of approximately $11.7 million, and these\n\nfunds emanate primarily from membership revenue. In short, GHP functions much like thousands\n\nof chambers of commerce across the nation that promote municipal and regional economies.\n\n       Consistent with its business model, GHP contracted to provide consulting, event planning,\n\nand marketing services to the City of Houston, pursuant to an “Agreement for Professional\n\nServices.” GHP and the City signed similar agreements annually for several years, including 2007\n\nand 2008, the time periods at issue here. The contracts included a “Scope of Services” exhibit that\n\ndelineated, under general headers, the specific services that GHP would provide to the City. Under\n\nthese contracts, GHP received quarterly payments in arrears contingent upon the City’s approval of\n\nperformance reports detailing the particular services GHP provided in that quarter. If GHP failed\n\n\n                                                3\n\fto deliver the contracted-for services to the City’s satisfaction, the contracts authorized the City to\n\npay GHP for the portion of services satisfactorily rendered. Notably, however, the two contracts\n\ndiffered in one significant respect: the 2008 contract expressly provided that “[n]othing in this\n\nAgreement shall be construed to imply that [GHP] is subject to the Texas Public Information Act.”\n\n       The instant suit arose from a May 2008 request Houston-area resident Jim Jenkins submitted\n\nto GHP in which he sought “a copy of the check register for [GHP] for all checks issued for the year\n\n2007.” Jenkins grounded his request in the Texas Public Information Act (TPIA), claiming that\n\n“[p]ublic records show that [GHP] is an organization that spends or that is supported in whole or in\n\npart by public funds,” and GHP is, therefore, “subject to the Public Information Act in the same\n\nmanner as a governmental body.”          See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(xii) (defining\n\n“governmental body” for purposes of the TPIA).\n\n       GHP objected to Jenkin’s request and did not disclose the information. GHP acknowledged\n\nit received public funds from the City but disagreed it qualified as a “governmental body” under the\n\nTPIA because the public funds were compensation for vendor services provided pursuant to an\n\narm’s-length contract with the City. The City’s annual payments under the contract amounted to less\n\nthan 8% of GHP’s total annual revenue; member contributions, on the other hand, totaled more than\n\n90% of its revenue. GHP further noted that of the roughly 2,100 companies that comprise its\n\nmembership, only four could be described as governmental bodies. Refusing to disclose the\n\nrequested information, GHP referred the matter to the Texas Attorney General as required under the\n\nTPIA. See id. §§ 552.301(a), .307.\n\n       In an informal letter ruling, the Attorney General’s Open Records Division agreed with\n\nJenkins, and concluded that GHP was a “governmental body” subject to the TPIA’s disclosure\n\n\n                                                  4\n\frequirements—specifically with respect to the 2007 contract with the City.1 Tex. Att’y Gen.\n\nOR2008-16062; see also TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.306. In reaching this conclusion, the Attorney\n\nGeneral determined that GHP’s operations were “supported” by the City because: (1) GHP provided\n\nvague and indefinite services to the City aimed at advancing the City’s overall economic\n\ndevelopment; (2) GHP and the City shared a common purpose and objective centered around the\n\nCity’s economy; and (3) GHP provided services traditionally supplied by the government. Tex.\n\nAtt’y Gen. OR2008-16062.\n\n        In response to the Attorney General’s informal ruling, GHP filed a declaratory-judgment\n\naction against the Attorney General seeking a declaration that: (1) the Attorney General lacked\n\njurisdiction over the dispute and (2) even if jurisdiction was proper, GHP was not a “governmental\n\nbody” under the TPIA. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE §§ 552.3215(e), .321, .325(a). Shortly after GHP\n\nfiled suit, Jenkins filed an additional request seeking a copy of GHP’s 2008 “disbursement registers\n\nand/or check registers,” including the number, date, payee name, amount, and purpose. Noting that\n\nGHP had already filed suit regarding the 2007 check-register request, the Attorney General closed\n\nthe second request without a finding and directed the trial court to resolve the dispute. Jenkins\n\nintervened in the lawsuit shortly thereafter. See id. § 552.325 (authorizing a requestor to intervene\n\nin the suit).\n\n        After a bench trial, the trial court found GHP was a “governmental body” supported by public\n\nfunds and ordered disclosure of the 2007 and 2008 check registers.2 The trial court determined that:\n\n        1\n         GHP did not claim any exemptions from mandatory disclosure and only challenged that it is a governmental\nbody subject to the TPIA in the first instance.\n\n        2\n           The sole witness was Tracye McDaniel, GHP’s executive vicepresident and chief operating officer.\nDocumentary evidence included: six other contracts between GHP and other governmental bodies executed after 2008;\nthe contracts between the City and GHP for fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009; GHP’s Articles of Incorporation;\n\n                                                       5\n\f         •        GHP received public funds to provide economic development and promotion services\n                  for or on behalf of the City;\n\n         •        GHP and the City shared the common purpose of economic development and\n                  promotion; and\n         •        An agency-type relationship was created between GHP and the City of Houston.\n\n\n         The court of appeals agreed with the trial court and affirmed its judgment, albeit over a\n\nstrongly worded dissent. 407 S.W.3d at 786, 787. Finding the phrase “supported in whole or in part\n\nby public funds” ambiguous, the lower court relied on an extra-textual analytical construct known\n\nas the Kneeland test to conclude GHP qualified as a governmental body under the TPIA.3 Id. at 782-\n\n83. The dissent criticized the court’s reliance on the Kneeland test, finding the statutory context\n\nunambiguously dictated only the narrow construction of “supported” as applied to a private entity.\n\nId. at 788 (Jones, C.J., dissenting).\n\n\n         On appeal to this Court, GHP advances three principal reasons why it is not a “governmental\n\nbody” under the TPIA. First, GHP contends the phrase “supported . . . by public funds”\n\nunambiguously excludes the City’s payments to GHP. Second, even if the language is ambiguous,\n\nthe Court should reject the Kneeland test because it is unclear and not grounded in the statutory\n\n\n\nJenkins’s requests for the 2007 and 2008 check registers; all four quarterly performance reports GHP submitted to the\nCity in 2007; and performance reports GHP submitted to other governmental bodies in 2007 and 2010.\n\n         3\n           Derived from a handful of nascent open-records rulings, the Kneeland test originated in a 1986 case\nconsidering whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Southwest Athletic Conference were “supported\nin whole or in part by public funds” under the TPIA’s predecessor statute. See Kneeland v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic\nAss’n, 650 F. Supp. 1047 (W .D. Tex. 1986), rev’d, 850 F.2d 224 (5th Cir. 1988). “Finding no dispositive Texas\njurisprudence on this issue,” the Fifth Circuit “closely examine[d] the opinions of the Texas Attorney General” and\ndiscovered “helpful signs, albeit mixed signals, in the [Attorney General] opinions.” Id. at 228. Despite a rather tepid\nendorsement, and without considering the statutory language, the court identified and applied “three distinct patterns of\nanalysis in opinions interpreting [the funding-source element] of the Act” to private entities. Id. Those “patterns of\nanalysis” provided the foundation for what became the three-pronged Kneeland test.\n\n                                                           6\n\flanguage. Third, GHP argues it is not “supported . . . by public funds” even under the Kneeland test.\n\nThe Attorney General disputes all three points. First, it contends that GHP plainly qualifies as a\n\n“governmental body” under the TPIA; limiting the statute’s reach to entities that exist solely to carry\n\nout government functions would frustrate its purpose of openness, and GHP is “supported” by public\n\nfunds. Second, the Kneeland test is not only the relevant framework in which to evaluate the TPIA’s\n\napplication to otherwise private entities, the Legislature has effectively endorsed the Kneeland test.4\n\nThird, the court of appeals properly applied the three Kneeland elements to GHP, a “governmental\n\nbody” subject to regulation under the TPIA.\n\n\n         We granted GHP’s petition for review to determine the proper scope of the funding source\n\nelement of the TPIA’s “governmental body” definition.\n\n\n                                                    II. Discussion\n\n\n                                                A. Background Law\n\n\n         The Legislature enacted the Texas Open Records Act in 1973 to increase government\n\ntransparency in the wake of public scandals, including a massive stock-fraud imbroglio known as\n\nthe Sharpstown scandal.5 In 1993, the Open Records Act was recodified without substantive revision\n\n\n\n\n         4\n           The Legislature has amended the TPIA several times without materially altering the funding-source element\nof the “governmental body” definition. See Act of M ay 29, 1995, 74th Leg., R.S., ch. 1035, § 2, 1995 Tex. Gen. Laws\n5127, 5128; see also Act of May 20, 1991, 72nd Leg., R.S., ch. 306, § 5, 1991 Tex. Gen. Laws 1340, 1341-42; Act of\nMay 17, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 633, § 2, 2001 Tex. Gen. Laws 1194, 1194-95; Act of April 23, 1999, 76th Leg., R.S.,\nch. 62, § 18.24, 1999 Tex. Gen. Laws 127, 403; Act of May 24, 2001, 77th Leg., R.S., ch. 1004, § 2, 2001 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 2186, 2187; Act of May 20, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., ch. 1276, § 9.014, 2003 Tex. Gen. Laws 4158, 4218.\n\n         5\n              See Act of M ay 19, 1973, 63rd Leg., R.S., ch. 424, § 1-16, 1973 Tex. Gen. Laws 1112, 1112-18 (codified at\nT EX . R EV . C IV . S TAT . art. 6252-17a); see generally Mutscher v. State, 514 S.W .2d 905, 910-11 (Tex. Crim. App. 1974)\n(summarizing events of Sharpstown scandal).\n\n                                                             7\n\fas the Texas Public Information Act.6 Currently codified in Chapter 552 of the Texas Government\n\nCode, the TPIA’s stated policy objectives are to provide accountability and transparency in\n\ngovernment by establishing mechanisms to foster public access to government records. See TEX .\n\nGOV ’T CODE §§ 552.001-.353. Importantly, an entity’s disclosure obligations under the TPIA hinge\n\non whether it is in fact a “governmental body.”\n\n\n         The TPIA defines a “governmental body” as one of twelve different types of entities. See\n\nid. § 552.003(1)(A). Most of the entities listed in section 552.003(1)(A) are identified quite\n\nprecisely; for example, a “school district board of trustees” is statutorily defined as a “governmental\n\nbody.” Id. § 552.003(1)(A)(v). Others are more amorphous, including the section at issue here,\n\nwhich subjects “the part, section, or portion of an organization, corporation, commission, committee,\n\ninstitution, or agency that spends or that is supported in whole or in part by public funds” to the\n\nTPIA. Id. § 552.003(1)(A)(xii). The crux of our inquiry in this case is the meaning of “supported\n\nin whole or in part by public funds.” The proper scope of this phrase is significant because the\n\nconsequences of being characterized as a governmental body are considerable. The most obvious\n\nis that under section 552.221 of the Texas Government Code, a “governmental body” must promptly\n\nproduce “public information” on request unless an exemption from disclosure applies and is timely\n\nasserted.7 See id. §§ 552.101-.123, .221; see also Tex. Comptroller of Pub. Accounts v. Att’y Gen.\n\n\n         6\n            Act of May 4, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 268, § 1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 986 (codified at T EX . G O V ’T\nC O D E §§ 552.001-.353).\n\n         7\n           To claim an exemption, a governmental body must, within ten business days after receiving a request, submit\na written statement to the Attorney General explaining why the information should be withheld and request an Attorney\nGeneral opinion. T EX . G O V ’T C O D E § 552.301(a), (b). If the Attorney General rules that the Act does not exempt the\ninformation from required disclosure, the governmental body must make it available to the requesting party or seek a\njudicial determination that the information does not have to be disclosed. Id. §§ 552.3215(e), .324, .325(a); see also City\nof Garland v. Dall. Morning News, 22 S.W .3d 351, 356 (Tex. 2000). If the governmental body refuses to disclose the\nrequested information, the Attorney General may seek to compel disclosure through a mandamus proceeding. T EX .\n\n                                                            8\n\fof Tex., 354 S.W.3d 336, 341-48 (Tex. 2010) (construing an exemption under the TPIA). The term\n\n“public information” broadly includes “information that is collected, assembled, or maintained under\n\na law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business” either: (1) “by a\n\ngovernmental body” or (2) “for a governmental body and the governmental body owns the\n\ninformation or has a right of access to it.” TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.002(a).\n\n\n                                      B. Statutory Construction\n\n\n          GHP argues that as a private entity, it is not subject to the TPIA’s disclosure requirements\n\nbecause it does not qualify as a “governmental body” under the statute’s plain language. GHP\n\ntherefore contends that it is entitled to seek the privacy protections typically afforded to non-\n\ngovernmental entities. Determining whether GHP is a “governmental body” whose records are\n\nsubject to disclosure under the TPIA presents a matter of statutory construction that we review de\n\nnovo. City of Garland v. Dall. Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 357 (Tex. 2000). When interpreting\n\na statute, our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the Legislature’s intent without\n\nunduly restricting or expanding the Act’s scope. City of Lorena v. BMTP Holdings, L.P., 409\n\nS.W.3d 634, 641 (Tex. 2013). We seek that intent first and foremost in the plain meaning of the text.\n\nId.; see also Tex. Lottery Comm’n v. First State Bank of DeQueen, 325 S.W.3d 628, 635 (Tex.\n\n2010). “Undefined terms in a statute are typically given their ordinary meaning, but if a different\n\nor more precise definition is apparent from the term’s use in the context of the statute, we apply that\n\nmeaning.” TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co. v. Combs, 340 S.W.3d 432, 439 (Tex. 2011). “However,\n\nwe will not give an undefined term a meaning that is out of harmony or inconsistent with other terms\n\n\n\nG O V ’T C O D E § 552.321.\n\n                                                   9\n\fin the statute.” State v. $1,760.00 in U.S. Currency, 406 S.W.3d 177, 180 (Tex. 2013). Therefore,\n\neven if an undefined term has multiple meanings, we recognize and apply only the meanings that are\n\nconsistent with the statutory scheme as a whole. Id. at 180-81. We only resort to rules of\n\nconstruction or extrinsic aids when a statute’s words are ambiguous. Entergy Gulf States, Inc. v.\n\nSummers, 282 S.W.3d 433, 437 (Tex. 2009). Finally, in construing the TPIA, we are mindful of the\n\nlegislative mandate that the TPIA be “liberally construed in favor of granting a request for\n\ninformation.” TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.001(b).\n\n\n         As an initial matter, we observe the parties’ agreement that GHP is a “governmental body”\n\nonly if it, or a “part, section, or portion” of it “is supported in whole or in part by public funds.” It\n\nis likewise undisputed that GHP receives “public funds.”8 The parties disagree, however, on the\n\nmeaning and application of the statutory phrase, “supported in whole or in part by.” GHP argues that\n\nthe TPIA cannot reasonably be interpreted to apply to privately-controlled corporations that perform\n\nservices under quid pro quo government contracts.                          According to GHP, the Legislature\n\nunambiguously intended “supported in whole or in part by public funds” to identify entities that were\n\ncreated or exist to carry out government functions and whose existence are maintained in whole or\n\nin part with public funds. Conversely, the Attorney General declares the statutory language\n\nambiguous because it could reasonably be read to apply to any contract between the government and\n\na private entity. We agree with GHP.\n\n\n         “Supported” is an undefined term with multiple and varied dictionary definitions. However,\n\nonly two of the definitions are even remotely possible as applied to the TPIA and only one of those\n\n\n         8\n            “Public funds” refers to the “funds of the state or of a governmental subdivision of the state.” T EX . G O V ’T\nC O D E § 552.003(5).\n\n                                                            10\n\fdefinitions is reasonable when the statute is considered as a whole. Reading the definition of\n\n“governmental body” in its contextual environment—as we are bound to do—reveals that the TPIA\n\napplies only to entities acting as the functional equivalent of a governmental body that are\n\n“sustained” at least in part, by public funds. In reaching this conclusion, we remain ever mindful of\n\nthe statute’s liberal-construction clause. But liberal-construction objectives do not permit a\n\nconstruction of the Act untethered from its statutory moorings.\n\n\n        Familiar interpretive guides and established canons of construction inform our reading of\n\nsection 552.003(1)(A)(xii). In determining the meaning of “supported . . . by public funds,” we\n\nbegin, as we must, with the statute’s plain language. Tex. Lottery Comm’n, 325 S.W.3d at 635.\n\nCommon English words frequently have a number of dictionary definitions, some quite abstruse and\n\nesoteric, others more comprehensible and commonplace. See, e.g., $1,760.00 in U.S. Currency, 406\n\nS.W.3d at 180-81 (noting that “novelty” has multiple dictionary definitions). Not surprisingly,\n\n“supported,” the key term here, is subject to at least six disparate definitions in its verb form alone,\n\nwith many of those including more nuanced sub-definitions. See WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L\n\nDICTIONARY 2297 (2002). By reading the term in context, however, we can narrow the universe of\n\npossible definitions to the most apposite. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co., 340 S.W.3d at 439.\n\n\n        As always, we are cognizant of the “fundamental principle of statutory construction and\n\nindeed of language itself that words’ meanings cannot be determined in isolation but must be drawn\n\nfrom the context in which they are used.” Id. at 441. We must therefore analyze the reasonableness\n\nof each definition in light of the statutory context. See Jaster v. Comet II Const., Inc., 438 S.W.3d\n\n556, 562 (Tex. 2014); see also R.R. Comm’n v. Tex. Citizens for a Safe Future & Clean Water, 336\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fS.W.3d 619, 628 (Tex. 2011) (“We generally avoid construing individual provisions of a statute in\n\nisolation from the statute as a whole.”). The statute’s first contextual clue emerges from the words\n\nimmediately surrounding “supported.” To avoid disharmony with the rest of the statute, “supported”\n\nmust bear reference to “public funds,” so it is clear that non-monetary definitions of “supported”\n\nmake little sense in context. See WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L DICTIONARY 921 (2002) (defining\n\n“funds” as “available pecuniary resources”). Applying this limitation, we winnow the field down\n\nto two potential meanings for “supported,” both of which are faithful to the statutory context:\n\n\n        (1) to pay the costs of: maintain; to supply with the means of maintenance (as lodging, food\n        or clothing) or to earn or furnish funds for maintaining; or\n        (2) to provide a basis for the existence or subsistence of: serve as the source of material or\n        immaterial supply, nourishment, provender, fuel, raw material, or sustenance of.\n\n\nSee WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L DICTIONARY 2297 (2002); accord BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY\n\n1668 (10th ed. 2009) (defining the term “support” to mean “[s]ustenance or maintenance”). In\n\nstatutory context, “supported” must thus mean sustenance, maintenance, or both.\n\n\n        Another contextual clue derives from the Act’s purpose. The statutory context indicates that\n\nall section 552.001(a) entities are either the government or its functional equivalent. First, the statute\n\nprovides the public with “complete information about the affairs of government and the official acts\n\nof public officials and employees.” TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.001(a). The stated purpose of\n\npermitting access to this information is to allow the public to “retain control over the instruments\n\nthey have created.” Id. A reasonable definition of “supported” must be compatible with this stated\n\npurpose. The statute also specially defines the term “governmental body.” In defining that term, the\n\nLegislature carefully omitted any broad reference to private entities, instead including private entities\n\n\n                                                   12\n\finsofar as they are “supported . . . by public funds.” Compare id., with FLA . STAT . § 119.011(2).\n\nIn light of this omission, which we presume the Legislature purposefully selected, the scope of the\n\nterm “governmental body,” as applied to private entities, must be filtered through the Act’s purpose\n\nand function of allowing access to instrumentalities of government. Thus, the Act only applies to\n\nprivate entities acting as the functional equivalent of the government. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical\n\nCo., 340 S.W.3d at 439.\n\n\n       Defining “supported” to mean “maintenance” is untenable because doing so risks sweeping\n\nany private entity that received any public funds within the definition of a “governmental body.” See\n\n407 S.W.3d at 781 (citing Tex. Ass’n of Appraisal Dists., Inc. v. Hart, 382 S.W.3d 587, 591-92 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2012, no pet.)). To resurrect the example provided by the court of appeals, if we\n\nequate “supported” with supplying an entity with a means by which the entity can pay for necessities,\n\nthen even a paper vendor with hundreds of clients would qualify as a “governmental body” merely\n\nby virtue of getting paid for selling office supplies to a single state office. See 407 S.W.3d at 781.\n\nEvery company must expend funds to stay in business; it would be impossible to conclude that any\n\nbusiness compensated for providing goods or services to a governmental entity pursuant to a quid\n\npro quo contract was not using public funds to pay for necessities. Thus, any entity doing business\n\nwith the government would be a “governmental body.”\n\n\n        “Quid pro quo” means “[a]n action or thing that is exchanged for another action or thing of\n\nmore or less equal value.” See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1443 (10th ed. 2009). As the dissent\n\nagrees, the Legislature did not intend for the statute to reach entities involved in quid pro quo\n\ntransactions with the government, and it is undisputed that a fair reading of the statute cannot\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fcountenance such a result. 407 S.W.3d at 789. We reject any reading of “supported” that would\n\ninjudiciously apply public transparency laws to private businesses merely because they receive public\n\nfunds under a contract with the government. Accordingly, the “maintenance” definition of\n\n“supported” is not textually viable.\n\n\n       In contrast, defining “supported” as “sustenance” ensures that only an entity, or its “part,\n\nsection or portion,” whose existence is predicated on the continued receipt of government funds\n\nwould qualify as a “governmental body.” Among the meanings of “sustain” are “to cause to\n\ncontinue; to keep up; to carry or withstand; to nourish; to prevent from sinking or giving way.” See\n\nWEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L DICTIONARY 2304 (2002); see also BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1676\n\n(10th ed. 2009) (defining “sustain” to mean “to nourish and encourage”). Applying this construction,\n\nthe universe of private entities constituting governmental bodies is obviously more circumscribed\n\nbecause only a small segment of private entities could fairly be considered to be sustained by the\n\ngovernment. To be “sustained” by public funds suggests the existence of a financially dependent\n\nrelationship between the governmental body and a private entity or its subdivision redolent of that\n\nbetween a parent and child or principal and agent. Financial dependency need not be absolute,\n\nhowever. Rather, the government could be one of several contributing sources. But sustenance\n\nimplies that if the government ceased to provide financial support, the entity would be unable to\n\nmeet its financial obligations. Unquestionably, a private entity would qualify under a financially\n\ndependent construction of “supported” if it could not pursue its mission and objectives without the\n\nreceipt of public funds, even if that funding only partially financed the entity’s endeavors. In short,\n\nan entity “supported” by public funds would not just receive government funds; it would require\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fthem to operate in whole or in part.9 If we construe “supported . . . by public funds” in this manner,\n\nwe must conclude GHP is not “supported” by public funds because it receives only a small portion\n\nof its revenue from government contracts. And even if these government contracts were eliminated,\n\nit could continue to operate given the substantial revenue derived from other non-governmental\n\nsources. Moreover, GHP could and would continue to promote the greater Houston economy to\n\nadvance its own interests and those of its more than 2,000 non-government members. GHP, in sum,\n\ndoes not require public funds and thus, is not sustained by public funds.\n\n\n         Because only one definition fits the statutory context, we conclude that “supported . . . by\n\npublic funds” must be appropriately defined to only include those entities “sustained” by public\n\nfunds—thereby ensuring that the statute encompasses only those private entities dependent on the\n\npublic fisc to operate as a going concern. Although not dispositive, our conclusion is reinforced by\n\nthe fact that this construction of the term “supported” is consistent with the scope and nature of the\n\neleven other types of entities more clearly described as a “governmental body” in the same provision.\n\nSee TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A). The canon of statutory construction known as noscitur a\n\nsociis—“it is known by its associates”—holds that the meaning of a word or phrase, especially one\n\nin a list, should be known by the words immediately surrounding it. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical\n\nCo., 340 S.W.3d at 441. We rely on this principle to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad\n\nthat it is incommensurate with the statutory context. Accordingly, in evaluating the breadth of\n\n“supported in whole or in part by public funds,” we may consider the scope of the enumerated\n\n\n\n         9\n           It is possible, of course, that a portion of a private entity could be sustained by public funds even where the\nprivate entity, as a whole, is not. In such instances, if the department or division is sustained by public funds, the division\nmay be subject to the TPIA’s disclosure obligations. Here, GHP did not segregate funds, and it argued that such\nsegregation would be logistically impossible.\n\n                                                              15\n\fcategories preceding it. See Fiess v. State Farm Lloyds, 202 S.W.3d 744, 750-51 (Tex. 2006). Of\n\nthe eleven other examples of a “governmental body” listed in the statutory definition of the term, two\n\nstand out as arguably the most analogous to a private nonprofit like GHP. Thus, we briefly consider\n\neach in comparison.\n\n\n        First, the statute expressly identifies as a “governmental body” the governing board of a\n\nnonprofit water supply or wastewater service corporation that is organized under Chapter 67 of the\n\nTexas Water Code and exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Texas Tax Code. See TEX .\n\nGOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(ix). A nonprofit corporation of this type is authorized to engage in\n\nseveral traditional governmental functions, such as the right to build and operate water- and waste-\n\ntreatment facilities and sell water to political subdivisions, private entities, or individuals. See TEX .\n\nWATER CODE § 67.002. Additionally, depending on the size of the county it serves, a nonprofit\n\nwater or waste-water service provider may even establish and enforce “customer water conservation\n\npractices” through the assessment of “reasonable penalties as provided in the corporation’s tariff.”\n\nSee id. § 67.011(a)(5), (b). By virtue of their special powers and privileges, these nonprofit utility\n\noperators essentially function as quasi-public corporations servicing the public. See Garwood Irr.\n\nCo. v. Williams, 243 S.W.2d 453, 456 (Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1951, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n\n        The second potentially private “governmental body” identified in the statute is a nonprofit\n\ncorporation eligible to receive federal funding, in the form of block grants, for anti-poverty programs\n\nat the state level. TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(xi). Under this federal initiative, a nonprofit\n\nmay receive funds if it demonstrates “expertise in providing training to individuals and organizations\n\non methods of effectively addressing the needs of low-income families and communities” through\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fa detailed application process.10 42 U.S.C. § 9913(c)(2) (2012); see also OFFICE OF CMTY . SERVS.,\n\nU.S. DEP ’T    OF   HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS., COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT STATE                          AND\n\n\nELIGIBLE ENTITY TECHNICAL ASSISTANT SERVICES 16-17(2015) (listing eligibility requirements).11\n\nA section 552.003(i)(A)(xi) “governmental body” must be “authorized by this state to serve a\n\ngeographic area of the state.” See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(xi). This requirement\n\npresupposes that the nonprofit has a close working relationship with the state government. See 10\n\nTEX . ADMIN . CODE § 5.211 (requiring an authorized nonprofit to submit monthly performance\n\nreports to the state agency monitoring the program).\n\n\n        The foregoing examples describe ostensibly private entities deputized by the government to\n\nprovide services traditionally considered governmental prerogatives or responsibilities. Thus,\n\nalthough nominally private, each is in fact acting as a quasi-public entity performing a core\n\ngovernmental function. There is a significant difference between an entity of this nature and one like\n\nGHP, and our construction of “supported in whole or in part by public funds” reflects as much by\n\ncapturing only those entities acting as the functional equivalent of the government. See Fiess, 202\n\nS.W.3d at 751.\n\n\n        Our construction of the term “supported” remains faithful to the TPIA’s liberal-construction\n\nclause. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.001(b) (“This chapter shall be liberally construed in favor of\n\ngranting a request for information.”). We have consistently recognized this clause expresses an\n\nimportant statement of legislative purpose, and we continue to adhere to it today. See, e.g., City of\n\n\n       10\n          The federal program is codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 9901-9926 (2012) and is administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Office of Community Service. See 42 U.S.C. § 9912 (2012).\n\n       11\n            Available at http://www.acf.hhs.gov/grants/open/foa/files/ HHS-2015-ACF-OCS-ET-1007_1.pdf.\n\n                                                      17\n\fGarland, 22 S.W.3d at 364 (“Unlike the [Freedom of Information Act], our Act contains a strong\n\nstatement of public policy favoring public access to governmental information and a statutory\n\nmandate to construe the Act to implement that policy and to construe it in favor of granting a request\n\nfor information.”). Still, even a liberal construction must remain grounded in the statute’s language\n\nand cannot overwhelm contextual indicators limiting public intrusion into the private affairs of non-\n\ngovernmental entities.12\n\n\n         In sum, we define “supported in whole or in part by public funds” to include only those\n\nprivate entities or their sub-parts sustained, at least in part, by public funds, meaning they could not\n\nperform the same or similar services without the public funds. If GHP (as a private entity that\n\nreceives government funds even while not being supported by them) presents the hard case, entities\n\non the ends of the spectrum—those that receive no government money, and those that receive only\n\ngovernment money—will obviously present much more straightforward questions. Determining\n\nwhether a partially funded entity qualifies as a “governmental body” will likely require case-specific\n\nanalysis and a close examination of the facts. Nonetheless, we recognize as a general proposition\n\nthat an entity, like GHP, that does not depend on any particular revenue source to survive—public\n\nor private—is not sustained even in part by government funds.\n\n\n         12\n            There is little to support the view that open-records laws were envisioned as tools to pry open the sensitive\nrecords of private entities or to function as a private discovery tool. See N.L.R.B. v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437\nU.S. 214, 242 (1978) (describing the Freedom of Information Act). Instead, we have recognized:\n\n         The Texas Legislature promulgated the TPIA with the express purpose of providing the public\n         “complete information about the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and\n         employees.” The Act is aimed at preserving a fundamental tenet of representative democracy: “that\n         the government is the servant and not the master of the people.” At its core, the TPIA reflects the\n         public policy that the people of Texas “insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control\n         over the instruments they have created.”\n\nJackson v. State Office of Admin. Hearings, 351 S.W .3d 290, 293 (Tex. 2011) (citations omitted).\n\n                                                           18\n\f                                      C. Other Jurisdictions\n\n\n       While our construction of the TPIA is supported by a plain-meaning reading of the statute,\n\nan examination of similar open-records statutes from other jurisdictions is also instructive. In states\n\nwhere open-records acts apply to entities “supported in whole or in part by public funds,” our sister\n\ncourts have unanimously construed the phrase to exclude, as a general matter, private entities\n\nreceiving public funds pursuant to quid pro quo agreements without regard to whether such an\n\nagreement is the entity’s only funding source. See, e.g., Indianapolis Convention & Visitors Ass’n,\n\nInc. v. Indianapolis Newspapers, Inc., 577 N.E.2d 208, 214 (Ind. 1991) (“In situations involving a\n\nquid pro quo, that is, measured goods or services given in exchange for payment based on\n\nidentifiable quantities of goods or services, a private entity would not be transformed into a public\n\nentity because it would not be maintained and supported by public funds.”); Weston v. Carolina\n\nResearch & Dev. Found., 401 S.E.2d 161, 165 (S.C. 1991) (“[T]his decision does not mean that the\n\n[open-records act] would apply to business enterprises that receive payment from public bodies in\n\nreturn for supplying specific goods or services on an arms length basis.”); Adams Cnty. Record v.\n\nGreater N.D. Ass’n, 529 N.W.2d 830, 836 (N.D. 1995) (“When there is a bargained-for exchange\n\nof value, a quid pro quo, the entity is not supported by public funds.”). Additionally, even in those\n\nstates whose open-records acts fail to define “governmental body” or an equivalent term, our sister\n\ncourts still narrowly construe the statute to include only private entities that have a relationship so\n\nintertwined with the government that they are the “functional equivalent of a governmental agency.”\n\nMemphis Publ’g Co. v. Cherokee Children & Family Servs., Inc., 87 S.W.3d 67, 78-79 (Tenn. 2002);\n\nsee also State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, 854 N.E.2d 193, 198-99 (Ohio 2006).\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f       Recognizing the right of private businesses to conduct their affairs autonomously, at least one\n\ncourt has adopted a presumption that a private entity is not subject to an open-records request absent\n\nclear and convincing evidence that the private entity is the functional equivalent of a governmental\n\nbody. See, e.g., State ex rel Oriana House, Inc., 854 N.E.2d at 200. In Florida, the only state whose\n\nstatute expressly includes private entities, the Florida Supreme Court narrowly interpreted its open-\n\nrecords act to exclude private entities merely providing professional services to a governmental body.\n\nSee News & Sun-Sentinel Co. v. Schwab, Twitty & Hanser Architectural Group, Inc., 596 So. 2d\n\n1029, 1031 (Fla. 1992) (construing FLA . STAT . § 119.011(2)). In fact, of those states with similar\n\nstatutes, we have not encountered one that has construed an open-records act to include a private\n\nentity providing specific and measurable vendor services to a governmental body, even if that entity\n\nreceives public funds. We find it difficult to ignore this interpretative uniformity, especially\n\nconsidering the gravitas of the interests at stake.\n\n\n       Our plain-meaning construction also comports with federal precedent interpreting the federal\n\nanalogue—the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See Tex. Comptroller of Pub. Accounts, 354\n\nS.W.3d at 342 (noting that because the Legislature modeled the TPIA on the FOIA, federal precedent\n\nis persuasive in construing the Act). Under the FOIA, “agency,” the federal equivalent of\n\n“governmental body,” is defined to include:\n\n\n       any executive department, military department, Government corporation,\n       Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch\n       of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any\n       independent regulatory agency.\n\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) (2012). In interpreting this broad language, the United States Supreme Court\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fheld that a private entity receiving federal funding is considered a “government controlled\n\ncorporation” and subject to FOIA disclosure requirements only if the private entity is also subjected\n\nto “extensive, detailed, and virtually day-to-day supervision” by the government. Forsham v. Harris,\n\n445 U.S. 169, 180 (1980). The federal supervision must be “substantial . . . and not just the exercise\n\nof regulatory authority necessary to assure compliance with the goals of the federal grant.” Id. at 180\n\nn.11. Thus, narrowly defining “supported in whole or in part by public funds” under Texas law is\n\nconsistent with the approach of other jurisdictions featuring similar acts and the United States\n\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of the federal act on which the TPIA is based.\n\n\n                                     D. Response to the Dissent\n\n\n        We briefly address some of the contentions in the dissenting opinion. Regarding statutory\n\nconstruction, there is little disagreement about the guiding principles and relevant canons involved\n\nhere, and we agree, of course, that the canon of noscitur a sociis “cannot be used to render express\n\nstatutory language meaningless.” Slip Op. at 27 (Boyd, J., dissenting). We disagree as to the proper\n\nimplementation of the canon, however. The dissent asserts that the first eleven definitions of\n\n“governmental body” in the TPIA should be cabined off from the twelfth definition of that term\n\nbecause the twelfth definition “uses specific language, inherently different than the language of the\n\nother definitions.” Id. at 27. The dissent, thus, argues that the nature of the first eleven definitions\n\ncannot inform the twelfth. We disagree. All twelve are definitions of governmental bodies, and\n\ngiven that the twelfth definition is the most open-ended, blinders would be required to construe it\n\nin isolation from its statutory predecessors. Separating the definitions in this way would not only\n\nbe artificial, it would also deprive us of a key source of insight into the parameters of the more\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fexpansive twelfth definition.\n\n\n         More significant, however, is the dissent’s suggestion that the statute is ambiguous. The\n\ndissent, building on this imprudent reading, would look to Attorney General decisions and the\n\nKneeland test for “further guidance.” Id. at 31. In canvassing the landscape of informal Attorney\n\nGeneral rulings and divining instruction therefrom, the dissent resurrects Kneeland’s questionable\n\nmethodology, which did the same. And as that court itself noted, even if “[o]ne may have no quarrel\n\nwith the formulae,” “the direction given is a mite uncertain.” Kneeland, 850 F.2d at 228. The\n\ndissent finds Kneeland “persuasive” but we do not reach that analysis because of our determination\n\nthat the statutory language unambiguously excludes GHP from qualifying as a “governmental body.”\n\nNonetheless, we think it worth brief pause to note Kneeland’s questionable foundation, as it—along\n\nwith the raft of informal Attorney General rulings that bookend the decision—constitute the “forty\n\nyears of legal interpretations” that we supposedly ignore in today’s opinion.13 Slip Op. at 3 (Boyd,\n\nJ., dissenting). But many of these rulings were informal and, as such lack any precedential value.\n\nPut simply, the weight of this legal authority is considerably less august than the dissent’s\n\nformulation implies.\n\n\n         While the dissent purports to rehabilitate Kneeland, its revised test is at best a partial\n\nimprovement. The revised test makes it virtually impossible for an entity that provides intangible\n\ndeliverables, such as consulting, advertising, or legal services, to satisfy the “specific and measurable\n\n\n         13\n             The Kneeland test gained prominence by happenstance rather than design. It derived from a single federal\ndistrict court opinion based on five conclusory Attorney General opinions written without any attempt to construe the\nstatutory language. After Kneeland issued, the Attorney General adopted the test without further analysis. Thereafter,\nthe lower courts used the Kneeland test out of deference to the Attorney General, also without scrutinizing the test in light\nof the statutory text and legislative intent embodied therein. W e decline to defer to a test created without consideration\nof the statutory language.\n\n                                                             22\n\fservices” prong of the test. The dissent portrays GHP as sharing only broad, amorphous goals with\n\nthe City. Yet, the “broad” contract language referenced by the dissent actually refers to GHP’s more\n\ngeneral overarching objectives (essentially, these statements of objectives function as titles under\n\nwhich specific obligations of the contract are delineated). Each broad objective is followed by a list\n\nof specific services GHP promised to provide to achieve those objectives. For example, GHP was\n\nhired “to identify new business opportunities, secure economic incentives and increase outreach and\n\nrecruitment activities to the region’s targeted key industries to strengthen the City of Houston as a\n\ncompetitive place to do business.” In furtherance of that objective, GHP is contractually obligated\n\nto develop business relationships with the top twenty-five companies not currently headquartered\n\nin the City; create and implement a business-retention program to provide quick responses to\n\ncompanies in the City; and arrange and host ten recruiting trips, or “Signature Events,” for Houston-\n\nbased executives to visit target companies and pitch them on the City’s business advantages. These\n\nservices are specific and measurable and are the sort of quid pro quo exchanges typical of a vendor\n\nservices contract in that industry.\n\n\n       Thus, we do not believe that the monetary payments due to GHP under the 2007 and 2008\n\nagreements are “general or unrestricted payment[s] provided to subsidize or underwrite the entity’s\n\nactivities” rather than “specific measurable services.” Id. at 34. Even the dissent admits that\n\nsome—but not all—of GHP’s activities qualify as “specific measurable services,” so the\n\ndisagreement here is more a matter of degree than anything else.\n\n\n       The dissent’s revised test would also require that “the funds be intended to promote a\n\npurpose, interest, or mission that the governmental and private entities share and would both pursue\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\feven in the absence of their contractual relationship.” Id. at 36. The dissent posits that a law firm\n\nmay share a broad goal with a client, but the firm’s interest remains “transaction specific” in a way\n\nthat GHP’s engagement is not. Id. at 38. At the risk of quibbling, we dispute that this metaphorical\n\ndividing line is nearly that clear or marked. Many law firms are hired not merely for a specific\n\nlitigation matter but rather to provide more enduring and wide-ranging counsel. And more\n\nimportantly, while the dissent takes for granted that GHP and the City’s interests are perfectly\n\naligned (and presumably always will be), that assumption is debatable. For instance, although the\n\nvast majority of cities presumably welcome financial investment, growth can prove politically\n\ndivisive—just witness the debates over gentrification that grip many major cities experiencing\n\nexplosive economic expansion. Regardless, the point is that GHP is hardly the auxiliary and mirror\n\nof the City that the dissent portrays it to be, and the proposed revision of the Kneeland test will not\n\nsignificantly clarify this confused area of the law.\n\n\n       The dissent also contends that “the Court writes the words ‘in part’ completely out of the\n\nstatutory definition.” Id. at 21. Nothing so drastic is occurring here. The statute’s “in part”\n\nlanguage may envision a multi-division entity that does business with the government, but not\n\nuniformly and not across all units. For instance, one can conceptualize a subdivision of a large\n\ncorporation wholly funded by government contracts; nevertheless, because the subdivision is only\n\na small part of the large organization, the government business forms a relatively small portion of\n\nthe corporation’s total revenue. In this scenario, the organization may be said to be supported “in\n\npart” by public funds. Moreover, there may be more overlap between “in part” and the neighboring\n\nstatutory language than the dissent allows. While we generally attempt to avoid treating statutory\n\nlanguage as surplusage, “there are times when redundancies are precisely what the Legislature\n\n                                                  24\n\fintended.” In re Estate of Nash, 220 S.W.3d 914, 917-18 (Tex. 2007); see also In re City of\n\nGeorgetown, 53 S.W.3d 328, 336 (Tex. 2001) (noting that statutory redundancies may mean that\n\n“the Legislature repeated itself out of an abundance of caution, for emphasis, or both”). Regardless\n\nof whether such drafting caution is at work here, the point remains that there are a host of possible\n\nexplanations addressing the dissent’s concerns.\n\n\n                                          III. Conclusion\n\n\n       Amidst all the argument attempting to classify GHP as a governmental body, it is worth\n\nrecalling precisely what GHP is not: GHP is not a government agency, nor is it a quasi-public\n\nagency specifically listed under the Texas Government Code as a “governmental body.” GHP does\n\nnot rely on its government contracts to sustain itself as a going concern; as all parties acknowledge,\n\nthe government funds it receives constitute a relatively minuscule portion of GHP’s annual budget.\n\nThe only way GHP can qualify as a “governmental body,” then, is if it can be said to be “supported\n\nin whole or in part by public funds.”\n\n\n       GHP, like countless chambers of commerce nationwide, provides marketing, consulting, and\n\nevent-planning services to the City and other clients pursuant to quid pro quo contracts. Like the\n\nlobbying shops and law firms that also populate the State payroll, GHP shares many common\n\nobjectives with the City, but without more, such shared interests can hardly transform a service\n\nprovider into a government appendage. A private entity engaged in economically delicate work\n\nshould not be subjected to invasive disclosure requirements merely because it counts the government\n\nas one client among many. Transparency is a real concern, to be sure, and the TPIA’s liberal-\n\nconstruction mandate reflects the depth of this interest. But liberal construction is not tantamount\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fto boundless reach. Yet, even if not directly subject to disclosure obligations under the TPIA, GHP’s\n\ntransactions with the government are hardly in a black box; the City—which is indisputably a\n\n“governmental body”—must disclose information regarding its contractors, including GHP.\n\n\n       Applying the TPIA’s plain and unambiguous language, we hold that GHP is not “supported\n\nin whole or in part by public funds” and thus is not a “governmental body” under the TPIA. Because\n\nthe relevant provisions of the TPIA are unambiguous, we do not apply the analysis outlined in\n\nKneeland v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, 850 F.2d 224 (5th Cir. 1986), nor any other extra-\n\ntextual construct. We therefore reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment for\n\nGreater Houston Partnership.\n\n\n                                                      ____________________________________\n                                                      Eva M.

In seeking to promote the public’s legitimate interest in transparent\n\ngovernment, the Act imposes considerable disclosure obligations on “governmental bod[ies].”\n\nImportantly, the statutory definition of “governmental body” extends only to “the part, section, or\n\nportion of an organization, corporation, commission, committee, institution, or agency that spends\n\nor that is supported in whole or in part by public funds.”                 See TEX . GOV ’T CODE\n\n§ 552.003(1)(A)(xii) (emphasis added). This operates to prevent nominally private entities whose\n\nwork might otherwise qualify them as de facto public agencies from circumventing the Act’s\n\fdisclosure requirements. This case requires us to decide whether the term “supported” encompasses\n\nprivate entities contracting at arm’s length with the government to provide general and specific\n\nservices or whether the term properly includes only those entities that could not perform similar\n\nservices without public funds and, are thus, sustained—in whole or part—by such funds.\n\n        When a private entity enters into a contract and receives government funds in exchange for\n\nits services, the entity’s right to conduct its affairs confidentially may be in tension with the public’s\n\nright to know how government funds are spent. Transparency, openness, and accountability in the\n\ngovernment are all of fundamental importance. However, these important policy objectives cannot\n\nextinguish the privacy rights properly belonging to private business entities in Texas. By liberally\n\nauthorizing public access to government records while simultaneously shielding private business\n\nfrom unwarranted interference, the Legislature carefully balanced these conflicting interests.\n\nMindful of the delicate equilibrium between these equally compelling concerns, we conclude that\n\nthe term “supported,” which helps define the breadth of the Act, unambiguously includes only those\n\nentities at least partially sustained by public funding.          Because the statutory language is\n\nunambiguous, we need not consider the accuracy or vitality of the test articulated in Kneeland v.\n\nNational Collegiate Athletic Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508193\"><a href=\"/opinion/508193/carole-kneeland-and-belo-broadcasting-corp-and-ah-belo-corp-dba-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1988), which the Attorney General’s Open\n\nRecords Division has traditionally applied to private entities in cases involving open-record requests.\n\n        Here, Greater Houston Partnership, a nonprofit corporation providing economic-development\n\nservices to the City and other clients pursuant to quid pro quo contracts, contests whether it is a\n\n“governmental body” in whole or in part. Applying Kneeland, the Attorney General and lower\n\ncourts held that it is. We hold, however, that Greater Houston Partnership is not a “governmental\n\nbody” under the Texas Public Information Act because it is not wholly or partially sustained by\n\n\n                                                    2\n\fpublic funds; we therefore reverse the court of appeals’ judgment and render judgment for Greater\n\nHouston Partnership.\n\n                            I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Greater Houston Partnership (GHP) is a private, nonprofit corporation that promotes regional\n\neconomic growth and an attractive business climate for a ten-county area centered around Houston,\n\nTexas. GHP’s stated purpose is to enhance economic prosperity, facilitate business relocation and\n\nexpansion, encourage international outreach initiatives, and provide strategic planning to advocate\n\nfor “the improvement of commercial, industrial, agricultural, civic, and cultural affairs” in the\n\nHouston region. In furtherance of this objective, GHP provides consulting, event planning, and\n\nmarketing services (including advertising and market research) to its roughly 2,100 member\n\ncompanies on a contractual basis.      GHP also hosts numerous networking and professional\n\ndevelopment events, including several weekly GHP Council meetings on topics relevant to the\n\nregional economy. GHP operates on an annual budget of approximately $11.7 million, and these\n\nfunds emanate primarily from membership revenue. In short, GHP functions much like thousands\n\nof chambers of commerce across the nation that promote municipal and regional economies.\n\n       Consistent with its business model, GHP contracted to provide consulting, event planning,\n\nand marketing services to the City of Houston, pursuant to an “Agreement for Professional\n\nServices.” GHP and the City signed similar agreements annually for several years, including 2007\n\nand 2008, the time periods at issue here. The contracts included a “Scope of Services” exhibit that\n\ndelineated, under general headers, the specific services that GHP would provide to the City. Under\n\nthese contracts, GHP received quarterly payments in arrears contingent upon the City’s approval of\n\nperformance reports detailing the particular services GHP provided in that quarter. If GHP failed\n\n\n                                                3\n\fto deliver the contracted-for services to the City’s satisfaction, the contracts authorized the City to\n\npay GHP for the portion of services satisfactorily rendered. Notably, however, the two contracts\n\ndiffered in one significant respect: the 2008 contract expressly provided that “[n]othing in this\n\nAgreement shall be construed to imply that [GHP] is subject to the Texas Public Information Act.”\n\n       The instant suit arose from a May 2008 request Houston-area resident Jim Jenkins submitted\n\nto GHP in which he sought “a copy of the check register for [GHP] for all checks issued for the year\n\n2007.” Jenkins grounded his request in the Texas Public Information Act (TPIA), claiming that\n\n“[p]ublic records show that [GHP] is an organization that spends or that is supported in whole or in\n\npart by public funds,” and GHP is, therefore, “subject to the Public Information Act in the same\n\nmanner as a governmental body.”          See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(xii) (defining\n\n“governmental body” for purposes of the TPIA).\n\n       GHP objected to Jenkin’s request and did not disclose the information. GHP acknowledged\n\nit received public funds from the City but disagreed it qualified as a “governmental body” under the\n\nTPIA because the public funds were compensation for vendor services provided pursuant to an\n\narm’s-length contract with the City. The City’s annual payments under the contract amounted to less\n\nthan 8% of GHP’s total annual revenue; member contributions, on the other hand, totaled more than\n\n90% of its revenue. GHP further noted that of the roughly 2,100 companies that comprise its\n\nmembership, only four could be described as governmental bodies. Refusing to disclose the\n\nrequested information, GHP referred the matter to the Texas Attorney General as required under the\n\nTPIA. See id. §§ 552.301(a), .307.\n\n       In an informal letter ruling, the Attorney General’s Open Records Division agreed with\n\nJenkins, and concluded that GHP was a “governmental body” subject to the TPIA’s disclosure\n\n\n                                                  4\n\frequirements—specifically with respect to the 2007 contract with the City.1 Tex. Att’y Gen.\n\nOR2008-16062; see also TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.306. In reaching this conclusion, the Attorney\n\nGeneral determined that GHP’s operations were “supported” by the City because: (1) GHP provided\n\nvague and indefinite services to the City aimed at advancing the City’s overall economic\n\ndevelopment; (2) GHP and the City shared a common purpose and objective centered around the\n\nCity’s economy; and (3) GHP provided services traditionally supplied by the government. Tex.\n\nAtt’y Gen. OR2008-16062.\n\n        In response to the Attorney General’s informal ruling, GHP filed a declaratory-judgment\n\naction against the Attorney General seeking a declaration that: (1) the Attorney General lacked\n\njurisdiction over the dispute and (2) even if jurisdiction was proper, GHP was not a “governmental\n\nbody” under the TPIA. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE §§ 552.3215(e), .321, .325(a). Shortly after GHP\n\nfiled suit, Jenkins filed an additional request seeking a copy of GHP’s 2008 “disbursement registers\n\nand/or check registers,” including the number, date, payee name, amount, and purpose. Noting that\n\nGHP had already filed suit regarding the 2007 check-register request, the Attorney General closed\n\nthe second request without a finding and directed the trial court to resolve the dispute. Jenkins\n\nintervened in the lawsuit shortly thereafter. See id. § 552.325 (authorizing a requestor to intervene\n\nin the suit).\n\n        After a bench trial, the trial court found GHP was a “governmental body” supported by public\n\nfunds and ordered disclosure of the 2007 and 2008 check registers.2 The trial court determined that:\n\n        1\n         GHP did not claim any exemptions from mandatory disclosure and only challenged that it is a governmental\nbody subject to the TPIA in the first instance.\n\n        2\n           The sole witness was Tracye McDaniel, GHP’s executive vicepresident and chief operating officer.\nDocumentary evidence included: six other contracts between GHP and other governmental bodies executed after 2008;\nthe contracts between the City and GHP for fiscal years 2007, 2008, and 2009; GHP’s Articles of Incorporation;\n\n                                                       5\n\f         •        GHP received public funds to provide economic development and promotion services\n                  for or on behalf of the City;\n\n         •        GHP and the City shared the common purpose of economic development and\n                  promotion; and\n         •        An agency-type relationship was created between GHP and the City of Houston.\n\n\n         The court of appeals agreed with the trial court and affirmed its judgment, albeit over a\n\nstrongly worded dissent. 407 S.W.3d at 786, 787. Finding the phrase “supported in whole or in part\n\nby public funds” ambiguous, the lower court relied on an extra-textual analytical construct known\n\nas the Kneeland test to conclude GHP qualified as a governmental body under the TPIA.3 Id. at 782-\n\n83. The dissent criticized the court’s reliance on the Kneeland test, finding the statutory context\n\nunambiguously dictated only the narrow construction of “supported” as applied to a private entity.\n\nId. at 788 (Jones, C.J., dissenting).\n\n\n         On appeal to this Court, GHP advances three principal reasons why it is not a “governmental\n\nbody” under the TPIA. First, GHP contends the phrase “supported . . . by public funds”\n\nunambiguously excludes the City’s payments to GHP. Second, even if the language is ambiguous,\n\nthe Court should reject the Kneeland test because it is unclear and not grounded in the statutory\n\n\n\nJenkins’s requests for the 2007 and 2008 check registers; all four quarterly performance reports GHP submitted to the\nCity in 2007; and performance reports GHP submitted to other governmental bodies in 2007 and 2010.\n\n         3\n           Derived from a handful of nascent open-records rulings, the Kneeland test originated in a 1986 case\nconsidering whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Southwest Athletic Conference were “supported\nin whole or in part by public funds” under the TPIA’s predecessor statute.

Despite a rather tepid\nendorsement, and without considering the statutory language, the court identified and applied “three distinct patterns of\nanalysis in opinions interpreting [the funding-source element] of the Act” to private entities. Id. Those “patterns of\nanalysis” provided the foundation for what became the three-pronged Kneeland test.\n\n                                                           6\n\flanguage. Third, GHP argues it is not “supported . . . by public funds” even under the Kneeland test.\n\nThe Attorney General disputes all three points. First, it contends that GHP plainly qualifies as a\n\n“governmental body” under the TPIA; limiting the statute’s reach to entities that exist solely to carry\n\nout government functions would frustrate its purpose of openness, and GHP is “supported” by public\n\nfunds. Second, the Kneeland test is not only the relevant framework in which to evaluate the TPIA’s\n\napplication to otherwise private entities, the Legislature has effectively endorsed the Kneeland test.4\n\nThird, the court of appeals properly applied the three Kneeland elements to GHP, a “governmental\n\nbody” subject to regulation under the TPIA.\n\n\n         We granted GHP’s petition for review to determine the proper scope of the funding source\n\nelement of the TPIA’s “governmental body” definition.\n\n\n                                                    II.

See TEX .\n\nGOV ’T CODE §§ 552.001-.353. Importantly, an entity’s disclosure obligations under the TPIA hinge\n\non whether it is in fact a “governmental body.”\n\n\n         The TPIA defines a “governmental body” as one of twelve different types of entities. See\n\nid. § 552.003(1)(A). Most of the entities listed in section 552.003(1)(A) are identified quite\n\nprecisely; for example, a “school district board of trustees” is statutorily defined as a “governmental\n\nbody.” Id. § 552.003(1)(A)(v). Others are more amorphous, including the section at issue here,\n\nwhich subjects “the part, section, or portion of an organization, corporation, commission, committee,\n\ninstitution, or agency that spends or that is supported in whole or in part by public funds” to the\n\nTPIA. Id. § 552.003(1)(A)(xii). The crux of our inquiry in this case is the meaning of “supported\n\nin whole or in part by public funds.” The proper scope of this phrase is significant because the\n\nconsequences of being characterized as a governmental body are considerable. The most obvious\n\nis that under section 552.221 of the Texas Government Code, a “governmental body” must promptly\n\nproduce “public information” on request unless an exemption from disclosure applies and is timely\n\nasserted.7 See id. §§ 552.101-.123, .221; see also Tex. Comptroller of Pub. Accounts v. Att’y Gen.\n\n\n         6\n            Act of May 4, 1993, 73rd Leg., R.S., ch. 268, § 1, 1993 Tex. Gen. Laws 583, 986 (codified at T EX . G O V ’T\nC O D E §§ 552.001-.353).\n\n         7\n           To claim an exemption, a governmental body must, within ten business days after receiving a request, submit\na written statement to the Attorney General explaining why the information should be withheld and request an Attorney\nGeneral opinion. T EX . G O V ’T C O D E § 552.301(a), (b). If the Attorney General rules that the Act does not exempt the\ninformation from required disclosure, the governmental body must make it available to the requesting party or seek a\njudicial determination that the information does not have to be disclosed. Id. §§ 552.3215(e), .324, .325(a); see also City\nof Garland v. Dall. Morning News, 22 S.W .3d 351, 356 (Tex. 2000). If the governmental body refuses to disclose the\nrequested information, the Attorney General may seek to compel disclosure through a mandamus proceeding.

Finally, in construing the TPIA, we are mindful of the\n\nlegislative mandate that the TPIA be “liberally construed in favor of granting a request for\n\ninformation.” TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.001(b).\n\n\n         As an initial matter, we observe the parties’ agreement that GHP is a “governmental body”\n\nonly if it, or a “part, section, or portion” of it “is supported in whole or in part by public funds.” It\n\nis likewise undisputed that GHP receives “public funds.”8 The parties disagree, however, on the\n\nmeaning and application of the statutory phrase, “supported in whole or in part by.” GHP argues that\n\nthe TPIA cannot reasonably be interpreted to apply to privately-controlled corporations that perform\n\nservices under quid pro quo government contracts.                          According to GHP, the Legislature\n\nunambiguously intended “supported in whole or in part by public funds” to identify entities that were\n\ncreated or exist to carry out government functions and whose existence are maintained in whole or\n\nin part with public funds. Conversely, the Attorney General declares the statutory language\n\nambiguous because it could reasonably be read to apply to any contract between the government and\n\na private entity. We agree with GHP.\n\n\n         “Supported” is an undefined term with multiple and varied dictionary definitions. However,\n\nonly two of the definitions are even remotely possible as applied to the TPIA and only one of those\n\n\n         8\n            “Public funds” refers to the “funds of the state or of a governmental subdivision of the state.” T EX . G O V ’T\nC O D E § 552.003(5).\n\n                                                            10\n\fdefinitions is reasonable when the statute is considered as a whole. Reading the definition of\n\n“governmental body” in its contextual environment—as we are bound to do—reveals that the TPIA\n\napplies only to entities acting as the functional equivalent of a governmental body that are\n\n“sustained” at least in part, by public funds. In reaching this conclusion, we remain ever mindful of\n\nthe statute’s liberal-construction clause. But liberal-construction objectives do not permit a\n\nconstruction of the Act untethered from its statutory moorings.\n\n\n        Familiar interpretive guides and established canons of construction inform our reading of\n\nsection 552.003(1)(A)(xii). In determining the meaning of “supported . . . by public funds,” we\n\nbegin, as we must, with the statute’s plain language. Tex. Lottery Comm’n, 325 S.W.3d at 635.\n\nCommon English words frequently have a number of dictionary definitions, some quite abstruse and\n\nesoteric, others more comprehensible and commonplace. See, e.g., $1,760.00 in U.S. Currency, 406\n\nS.W.3d at 180-81 (noting that “novelty” has multiple dictionary definitions). Not surprisingly,\n\n“supported,” the key term here, is subject to at least six disparate definitions in its verb form alone,\n\nwith many of those including more nuanced sub-definitions. See WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L\n\nDICTIONARY 2297 (2002). By reading the term in context, however, we can narrow the universe of\n\npossible definitions to the most apposite. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical Co., 340 S.W.3d at 439.\n\n\n        As always, we are cognizant of the “fundamental principle of statutory construction and\n\nindeed of language itself that words’ meanings cannot be determined in isolation but must be drawn\n\nfrom the context in which they are used.” Id. at 441. We must therefore analyze the reasonableness\n\nof each definition in light of the statutory context. See Jaster v. Comet II Const., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">556</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (Tex. 2014); see also R.R.

The statute’s first contextual clue emerges from the words\n\nimmediately surrounding “supported.” To avoid disharmony with the rest of the statute, “supported”\n\nmust bear reference to “public funds,” so it is clear that non-monetary definitions of “supported”\n\nmake little sense in context. See WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L DICTIONARY 921 (2002) (defining\n\n“funds” as “available pecuniary resources”). Applying this limitation, we winnow the field down\n\nto two potential meanings for “supported,” both of which are faithful to the statutory context:\n\n\n        (1) to pay the costs of: maintain; to supply with the means of maintenance (as lodging, food\n        or clothing) or to earn or furnish funds for maintaining; or\n        (2) to provide a basis for the existence or subsistence of: serve as the source of material or\n        immaterial supply, nourishment, provender, fuel, raw material, or sustenance of.\n\n\nSee WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L DICTIONARY 2297 (2002); accord BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY\n\n1668 (10th ed. 2009) (defining the term “support” to mean “[s]ustenance or maintenance”). In\n\nstatutory context, “supported” must thus mean sustenance, maintenance, or both.\n\n\n        Another contextual clue derives from the Act’s purpose. The statutory context indicates that\n\nall section 552.001(a) entities are either the government or its functional equivalent. First, the statute\n\nprovides the public with “complete information about the affairs of government and the official acts\n\nof public officials and employees.” TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.001(a). The stated purpose of\n\npermitting access to this information is to allow the public to “retain control over the instruments\n\nthey have created.” Id. A reasonable definition of “supported” must be compatible with this stated\n\npurpose. The statute also specially defines the term “governmental body.” In defining that term, the\n\nLegislature carefully omitted any broad reference to private entities, instead including private entities\n\n\n                                                   12\n\finsofar as they are “supported . . . by public funds.” Compare id., with FLA . STAT . § 119.011(2).\n\nIn light of this omission, which we presume the Legislature purposefully selected, the scope of the\n\nterm “governmental body,” as applied to private entities, must be filtered through the Act’s purpose\n\nand function of allowing access to instrumentalities of government. Thus, the Act only applies to\n\nprivate entities acting as the functional equivalent of the government. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical\n\nCo., 340 S.W.3d at 439.\n\n\n       Defining “supported” to mean “maintenance” is untenable because doing so risks sweeping\n\nany private entity that received any public funds within the definition of a “governmental body.” See\n\n407 S.W.3d at 781 (citing Tex. Ass’n of Appraisal Dists., Inc. v. Hart, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591-92 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Austin 2012, no pet.)). To resurrect the example provided by the court of appeals, if we\n\nequate “supported” with supplying an entity with a means by which the entity can pay for necessities,\n\nthen even a paper vendor with hundreds of clients would qualify as a “governmental body” merely\n\nby virtue of getting paid for selling office supplies to a single state office. See 407 S.W.3d at 781.\n\nEvery company must expend funds to stay in business; it would be impossible to conclude that any\n\nbusiness compensated for providing goods or services to a governmental entity pursuant to a quid\n\npro quo contract was not using public funds to pay for necessities. Thus, any entity doing business\n\nwith the government would be a “governmental body.”\n\n\n        “Quid pro quo” means “[a]n action or thing that is exchanged for another action or thing of\n\nmore or less equal value.” See BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1443 (10th ed. 2009). As the dissent\n\nagrees, the Legislature did not intend for the statute to reach entities involved in quid pro quo\n\ntransactions with the government, and it is undisputed that a fair reading of the statute cannot\n\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fcountenance such a result. 407 S.W.3d at 789. We reject any reading of “supported” that would\n\ninjudiciously apply public transparency laws to private businesses merely because they receive public\n\nfunds under a contract with the government. Accordingly, the “maintenance” definition of\n\n“supported” is not textually viable.\n\n\n       In contrast, defining “supported” as “sustenance” ensures that only an entity, or its “part,\n\nsection or portion,” whose existence is predicated on the continued receipt of government funds\n\nwould qualify as a “governmental body.” Among the meanings of “sustain” are “to cause to\n\ncontinue; to keep up; to carry or withstand; to nourish; to prevent from sinking or giving way.” See\n\nWEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INT ’L DICTIONARY 2304 (2002); see also BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1676\n\n(10th ed. 2009) (defining “sustain” to mean “to nourish and encourage”). Applying this construction,\n\nthe universe of private entities constituting governmental bodies is obviously more circumscribed\n\nbecause only a small segment of private entities could fairly be considered to be sustained by the\n\ngovernment. To be “sustained” by public funds suggests the existence of a financially dependent\n\nrelationship between the governmental body and a private entity or its subdivision redolent of that\n\nbetween a parent and child or principal and agent. Financial dependency need not be absolute,\n\nhowever. Rather, the government could be one of several contributing sources. But sustenance\n\nimplies that if the government ceased to provide financial support, the entity would be unable to\n\nmeet its financial obligations. Unquestionably, a private entity would qualify under a financially\n\ndependent construction of “supported” if it could not pursue its mission and objectives without the\n\nreceipt of public funds, even if that funding only partially financed the entity’s endeavors. In short,\n\nan entity “supported” by public funds would not just receive government funds; it would require\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fthem to operate in whole or in part.9 If we construe “supported . . . by public funds” in this manner,\n\nwe must conclude GHP is not “supported” by public funds because it receives only a small portion\n\nof its revenue from government contracts. And even if these government contracts were eliminated,\n\nit could continue to operate given the substantial revenue derived from other non-governmental\n\nsources. Moreover, GHP could and would continue to promote the greater Houston economy to\n\nadvance its own interests and those of its more than 2,000 non-government members. GHP, in sum,\n\ndoes not require public funds and thus, is not sustained by public funds.\n\n\n         Because only one definition fits the statutory context, we conclude that “supported . . . by\n\npublic funds” must be appropriately defined to only include those entities “sustained” by public\n\nfunds—thereby ensuring that the statute encompasses only those private entities dependent on the\n\npublic fisc to operate as a going concern. Although not dispositive, our conclusion is reinforced by\n\nthe fact that this construction of the term “supported” is consistent with the scope and nature of the\n\neleven other types of entities more clearly described as a “governmental body” in the same provision.\n\nSee TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A). The canon of statutory construction known as noscitur a\n\nsociis—“it is known by its associates”—holds that the meaning of a word or phrase, especially one\n\nin a list, should be known by the words immediately surrounding it. See TGS-NOPEC Geophysical\n\nCo., 340 S.W.3d at 441. We rely on this principle to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad\n\nthat it is incommensurate with the statutory context. Accordingly, in evaluating the breadth of\n\n“supported in whole or in part by public funds,” we may consider the scope of the enumerated\n\n\n\n         9\n           It is possible, of course, that a portion of a private entity could be sustained by public funds even where the\nprivate entity, as a whole, is not. In such instances, if the department or division is sustained by public funds, the division\nmay be subject to the TPIA’s disclosure obligations. Here, GHP did not segregate funds, and it argued that such\nsegregation would be logistically impossible.\n\n                                                              15\n\fcategories preceding it.

Of\n\nthe eleven other examples of a “governmental body” listed in the statutory definition of the term, two\n\nstand out as arguably the most analogous to a private nonprofit like GHP. Thus, we briefly consider\n\neach in comparison.\n\n\n        First, the statute expressly identifies as a “governmental body” the governing board of a\n\nnonprofit water supply or wastewater service corporation that is organized under Chapter 67 of the\n\nTexas Water Code and exempt from ad valorem taxation under the Texas Tax Code. See TEX .\n\nGOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(ix). A nonprofit corporation of this type is authorized to engage in\n\nseveral traditional governmental functions, such as the right to build and operate water- and waste-\n\ntreatment facilities and sell water to political subdivisions, private entities, or individuals. See TEX .\n\nWATER CODE § 67.002. Additionally, depending on the size of the county it serves, a nonprofit\n\nwater or waste-water service provider may even establish and enforce “customer water conservation\n\npractices” through the assessment of “reasonable penalties as provided in the corporation’s tariff.”\n\nSee id. § 67.011(a)(5), (b). By virtue of their special powers and privileges, these nonprofit utility\n\noperators essentially function as quasi-public corporations servicing the public. See Garwood Irr.\n\nCo. v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 456 (Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1951, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n\n        The second potentially private “governmental body” identified in the statute is a nonprofit\n\ncorporation eligible to receive federal funding, in the form of block grants, for anti-poverty programs\n\nat the state level. TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(xi). Under this federal initiative, a nonprofit\n\nmay receive funds if it demonstrates “expertise in providing training to individuals and organizations\n\non methods of effectively addressing the needs of low-income families and communities” through\n\n\n\n                                                   16\n\fa detailed application process.10 42 U.S.C. § 9913(c)(2) (2012); see also OFFICE OF CMTY . SERVS.,\n\nU.S. DEP ’T    OF   HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS., COMMUNITY SERVICES BLOCK GRANT STATE                          AND\n\n\nELIGIBLE ENTITY TECHNICAL ASSISTANT SERVICES 16-17(2015) (listing eligibility requirements).11\n\nA section 552.003(i)(A)(xi) “governmental body” must be “authorized by this state to serve a\n\ngeographic area of the state.” See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.003(1)(A)(xi). This requirement\n\npresupposes that the nonprofit has a close working relationship with the state government. See 10\n\nTEX . ADMIN . CODE § 5.211 (requiring an authorized nonprofit to submit monthly performance\n\nreports to the state agency monitoring the program).\n\n\n        The foregoing examples describe ostensibly private entities deputized by the government to\n\nprovide services traditionally considered governmental prerogatives or responsibilities. Thus,\n\nalthough nominally private, each is in fact acting as a quasi-public entity performing a core\n\ngovernmental function. There is a significant difference between an entity of this nature and one like\n\nGHP, and our construction of “supported in whole or in part by public funds” reflects as much by\n\ncapturing only those entities acting as the functional equivalent of the government. See Fiess, 202\n\nS.W.3d at 751.\n\n\n        Our construction of the term “supported” remains faithful to the TPIA’s liberal-construction\n\nclause. See TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 552.001(b) (“This chapter shall be liberally construed in favor of\n\ngranting a request for information.”). We have consistently recognized this clause expresses an\n\nimportant statement of legislative purpose, and we continue to adhere to it today. See, e.g., City of\n\n\n       10\n          The federal program is codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 9901-9926 (2012) and is administered by the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Office of Community Service.

Still, even a liberal construction must remain grounded in the statute’s language\n\nand cannot overwhelm contextual indicators limiting public intrusion into the private affairs of non-\n\ngovernmental entities.12\n\n\n         In sum, we define “supported in whole or in part by public funds” to include only those\n\nprivate entities or their sub-parts sustained, at least in part, by public funds, meaning they could not\n\nperform the same or similar services without the public funds. If GHP (as a private entity that\n\nreceives government funds even while not being supported by them) presents the hard case, entities\n\non the ends of the spectrum—those that receive no government money, and those that receive only\n\ngovernment money—will obviously present much more straightforward questions. Determining\n\nwhether a partially funded entity qualifies as a “governmental body” will likely require case-specific\n\nanalysis and a close examination of the facts. Nonetheless, we recognize as a general proposition\n\nthat an entity, like GHP, that does not depend on any particular revenue source to survive—public\n\nor private—is not sustained even in part by government funds.\n\n\n         12\n            There is little to support the view that open-records laws were envisioned as tools to pry open the sensitive\nrecords of private entities or to function as a private discovery tool.

STAT . § 119.011(2)). In fact, of those states with similar\n\nstatutes, we have not encountered one that has construed an open-records act to include a private\n\nentity providing specific and measurable vendor services to a governmental body, even if that entity\n\nreceives public funds. We find it difficult to ignore this interpretative uniformity, especially\n\nconsidering the gravitas of the interests at stake.\n\n\n       Our plain-meaning construction also comports with federal precedent interpreting the federal\n\nanalogue—the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See Tex. Comptroller of Pub. Accounts, 354\n\nS.W.3d at 342 (noting that because the Legislature modeled the TPIA on the FOIA, federal precedent\n\nis persuasive in construing the Act). Under the FOIA, “agency,” the federal equivalent of\n\n“governmental body,” is defined to include:\n\n\n       any executive department, military department, Government corporation,\n       Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch\n       of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President), or any\n       independent regulatory agency.\n\n\n5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) (2012).

Harris,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110218\"><a href=\"/opinion/110218/forsham-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 180 (1980). The federal supervision must be “substantial . . . and not just the exercise\n\nof regulatory authority necessary to assure compliance with the goals of the federal grant.” Id. at 180\n\nn.11. Thus, narrowly defining “supported in whole or in part by public funds” under Texas law is\n\nconsistent with the approach of other jurisdictions featuring similar acts and the United States\n\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of the federal act on which the TPIA is based.\n\n\n                                     D. Response to the Dissent\n\n\n        We briefly address some of the contentions in the dissenting opinion. Regarding statutory\n\nconstruction, there is little disagreement about the guiding principles and relevant canons involved\n\nhere, and we agree, of course, that the canon of noscitur a sociis “cannot be used to render express\n\nstatutory language meaningless.” Slip Op. at 27 (Boyd, J., dissenting). We disagree as to the proper\n\nimplementation of the canon, however. The dissent asserts that the first eleven definitions of\n\n“governmental body” in the TPIA should be cabined off from the twelfth definition of that term\n\nbecause the twelfth definition “uses specific language, inherently different than the language of the\n\nother definitions.” Id. at 27. The dissent, thus, argues that the nature of the first eleven definitions\n\ncannot inform the twelfth. We disagree. All twelve are definitions of governmental bodies, and\n\ngiven that the twelfth definition is the most open-ended, blinders would be required to construe it\n\nin isolation from its statutory predecessors. Separating the definitions in this way would not only\n\nbe artificial, it would also deprive us of a key source of insight into the parameters of the more\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\fexpansive twelfth definition.\n\n\n         More significant, however, is the dissent’s suggestion that the statute is ambiguous. The\n\ndissent, building on this imprudent reading, would look to Attorney General decisions and the\n\nKneeland test for “further guidance.” Id. at 31. In canvassing the landscape of informal Attorney\n\nGeneral rulings and divining instruction therefrom, the dissent resurrects Kneeland’s questionable\n\nmethodology, which did the same. And as that court itself noted, even if “[o]ne may have no quarrel\n\nwith the formulae,” “the direction given is a mite uncertain.” Kneeland, 850 F.2d at 228. The\n\ndissent finds Kneeland “persuasive” but we do not reach that analysis because of our determination\n\nthat the statutory language unambiguously excludes GHP from qualifying as a “governmental body.”\n\nNonetheless, we think it worth brief pause to note Kneeland’s questionable foundation, as it—along\n\nwith the raft of informal Attorney General rulings that bookend the decision—constitute the “forty\n\nyears of legal interpretations” that we supposedly ignore in today’s opinion.13 Slip Op. at 3 (Boyd,\n\nJ., dissenting). But many of these rulings were informal and, as such lack any precedential value.\n\nPut simply, the weight of this legal authority is considerably less august than the dissent’s\n\nformulation implies.\n\n\n         While the dissent purports to rehabilitate Kneeland, its revised test is at best a partial\n\nimprovement. The revised test makes it virtually impossible for an entity that provides intangible\n\ndeliverables, such as consulting, advertising, or legal services, to satisfy the “specific and measurable\n\n\n         13\n             The Kneeland test gained prominence by happenstance rather than design. It derived from a single federal\ndistrict court opinion based on five conclusory Attorney General opinions written without any attempt to construe the\nstatutory language. After Kneeland issued, the Attorney General adopted the test without further analysis. Thereafter,\nthe lower courts used the Kneeland test out of deference to the Attorney General, also without scrutinizing the test in light\nof the statutory text and legislative intent embodied therein. W e decline to defer to a test created without consideration\nof the statutory language.\n\n                                                             22\n\fservices” prong of the test. The dissent portrays GHP as sharing only broad, amorphous goals with\n\nthe City. Yet, the “broad” contract language referenced by the dissent actually refers to GHP’s more\n\ngeneral overarching objectives (essentially, these statements of objectives function as titles under\n\nwhich specific obligations of the contract are delineated). Each broad objective is followed by a list\n\nof specific services GHP promised to provide to achieve those objectives. For example, GHP was\n\nhired “to identify new business opportunities, secure economic incentives and increase outreach and\n\nrecruitment activities to the region’s targeted key industries to strengthen the City of Houston as a\n\ncompetitive place to do business.” In furtherance of that objective, GHP is contractually obligated\n\nto develop business relationships with the top twenty-five companies not currently headquartered\n\nin the City; create and implement a business-retention program to provide quick responses to\n\ncompanies in the City; and arrange and host ten recruiting trips, or “Signature Events,” for Houston-\n\nbased executives to visit target companies and pitch them on the City’s business advantages. These\n\nservices are specific and measurable and are the sort of quid pro quo exchanges typical of a vendor\n\nservices contract in that industry.\n\n\n       Thus, we do not believe that the monetary payments due to GHP under the 2007 and 2008\n\nagreements are “general or unrestricted payment[s] provided to subsidize or underwrite the entity’s\n\nactivities” rather than “specific measurable services.” Id. at 34. Even the dissent admits that\n\nsome—but not all—of GHP’s activities qualify as “specific measurable services,” so the\n\ndisagreement here is more a matter of degree than anything else.\n\n\n       The dissent’s revised test would also require that “the funds be intended to promote a\n\npurpose, interest, or mission that the governmental and private entities share and would both pursue\n\n\n\n                                                 23\n\feven in the absence of their contractual relationship.” Id. at 36. The dissent posits that a law firm\n\nmay share a broad goal with a client, but the firm’s interest remains “transaction specific” in a way\n\nthat GHP’s engagement is not. Id. at 38. At the risk of quibbling, we dispute that this metaphorical\n\ndividing line is nearly that clear or marked. Many law firms are hired not merely for a specific\n\nlitigation matter but rather to provide more enduring and wide-ranging counsel. And more\n\nimportantly, while the dissent takes for granted that GHP and the City’s interests are perfectly\n\naligned (and presumably always will be), that assumption is debatable. For instance, although the\n\nvast majority of cities presumably welcome financial investment, growth can prove politically\n\ndivisive—just witness the debates over gentrification that grip many major cities experiencing\n\nexplosive economic expansion. Regardless, the point is that GHP is hardly the auxiliary and mirror\n\nof the City that the dissent portrays it to be, and the proposed revision of the Kneeland test will not\n\nsignificantly clarify this confused area of the law.\n\n\n       The dissent also contends that “the Court writes the words ‘in part’ completely out of the\n\nstatutory definition.” Id. at 21. Nothing so drastic is occurring here. The statute’s “in part”\n\nlanguage may envision a multi-division entity that does business with the government, but not\n\nuniformly and not across all units. For instance, one can conceptualize a subdivision of a large\n\ncorporation wholly funded by government contracts; nevertheless, because the subdivision is only\n\na small part of the large organization, the government business forms a relatively small portion of\n\nthe corporation’s total revenue. In this scenario, the organization may be said to be supported “in\n\npart” by public funds. Moreover, there may be more overlap between “in part” and the neighboring\n\nstatutory language than the dissent allows. While we generally attempt to avoid treating statutory\n\nlanguage as surplusage, “there are times when redundancies are precisely what the Legislature\n\n                                                  24\n\fintended.” In re Estate of Nash, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894845\"><a href=\"/opinion/894845/in-re-estate-of-nash/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 917-18 (Tex. 2007); see also In re City of\n\nGeorgetown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1984210\"><a href=\"/opinion/1984210/in-re-city-of-georgetown/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336 (Tex. 2001) (noting that statutory redundancies may mean that\n\n“the Legislature repeated itself out of an abundance of caution, for emphasis, or both”). Regardless\n\nof whether such drafting caution is at work here, the point remains that there are a host of possible\n\nexplanations addressing the dissent’s concerns.\n\n\n                                          III. Conclusion\n\n\n       Amidst all the argument attempting to classify GHP as a governmental body, it is worth\n\nrecalling precisely what GHP is not: GHP is not a government agency, nor is it a quasi-public\n\nagency specifically listed under the Texas Government Code as a “governmental body.” GHP does\n\nnot rely on its government contracts to sustain itself as a going concern; as all parties acknowledge,\n\nthe government funds it receives constitute a relatively minuscule portion of GHP’s annual budget.\n\nThe only way GHP can qualify as a “governmental body,” then, is if it can be said to be “supported\n\nin whole or in part by public funds.”\n\n\n       GHP, like countless chambers of commerce nationwide, provides marketing, consulting, and\n\nevent-planning services to the City and other clients pursuant to quid pro quo contracts. Like the\n\nlobbying shops and law firms that also populate the State payroll, GHP shares many common\n\nobjectives with the City, but without more, such shared interests can hardly transform a service\n\nprovider into a government appendage. A private entity engaged in economically delicate work\n\nshould not be subjected to invasive disclosure requirements merely because it counts the government\n\nas one client among many. Transparency is a real concern, to be sure, and the TPIA’s liberal-\n\nconstruction mandate reflects the depth of this interest. But liberal construction is not tantamount\n\n\n                                                  25\n\fto boundless reach. Yet, even if not directly subject to disclosure obligations under the TPIA, GHP’s\n\ntransactions with the government are hardly in a black box; the City—which is indisputably a\n\n“governmental body”—must disclose information regarding its contractors, including GHP.\n\n\n       Applying the TPIA’s plain and unambiguous language, we hold that GHP is not “supported\n\nin whole or in part by public funds” and thus is not a “governmental body” under the TPIA. Because\n\nthe relevant provisions of the TPIA are unambiguous, we do not apply the analysis outlined in\n\nKneeland v.
