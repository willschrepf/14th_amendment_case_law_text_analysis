Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., Civ. No. 03-5702,\n\n2009 WL 2461892, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 12, 2009) (Stagi II).\n\n       Although it is a close call, we will reverse and remand for further proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                             I.\n\n       At issue in this case is Amtrak’s policy referred to as the “one-year blocking rule.”\n\nUnder that rule, a union member must be in her current union position for at least one\n\nyear in order to be eligible for promotion into a management position. The policy states,\n\n“[a]n agreement covered employee may not apply for a posted non-agreement covered\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fposition unless he or she has been in his or her current union for one year.” App. 299.1\n\nThe rule has no exceptions. The rule was first promulgated on May 1, 1994 and was\n\nrevised in September 2000, which revision was in force during the time period relevant\n\nfor this case.\n\n       Plaintiffs Stagi and Ladd are long-time Amtrak employees who have been\n\nemployed in both its union and management ranks during their careers. Stagi began her\n\ncareer at Amtrak in 1973 as a reservation and information clerk, and eventually worked\n\nher way up to various union positions until the early 1990s, when she was promoted to a\n\nmanagement position. She was in a management position in April 2002 when she was\n\nlaid off as a result of a corporate-wide management restructuring effort. Ladd was\n\npromoted to management in 1986 and continued to be promoted through management\n\nuntil April 2002, when her job was similarly eliminated. Because they had previously\n\nworked in Amtrak’s union ranks, they were both entitled to “bump down” into a union\n\nposition based on their retained union seniority. In the year following their layoffs, both\n\napplied for management vacancies, some of which they had previously held or\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Although the policy says “in his or her current union[,]” the parties agree that the\npolicy has been interpreted and applied by Amtrak as blocking an employee who has not\nbeen in his or her current union position for at least one year. See Stagi II, 2009 WL\n2461892, at *1 n.4 (“Although the way the rule is written appears to prevent\nconsideration of agreement-covered employees based on time-in-current-union, since at\nleast 1999 or 2000, the Policy has been applied consistently to consider time-in-position,\nnot time-in-union . . . . The language of the policy [sic] was changed in 2004 (after the\ncommencement of this litigation).”).\n\n                                              4\n\fsupervised. They were both blocked by the one-year rule from being considered for those\n\npositions. Stagi remains in her union position. Ladd was not able to return to\n\nmanagement before 2004, when she left on long-term disability and retired with benefits\n\ninferior to those she would have enjoyed had she been permitted to access a management\n\nposition.\n\n       In October 2003, Stagi filed a class complaint, and later amended it to add Ladd.\n\nPlaintiffs’ complaint alleges that Amtrak violated Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.,\n\nand the Equal Protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\n\nby adopting and applying the one-year rule to plaintiffs.\n\n       In May 2005, Amtrak moved for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c) of\n\nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court denied Amtrak’s motion holding\n\nthat plaintiffs had “made out a prima facie case” of disparate impact by the blocking rule\n\nat issue here. Stagi v. Amtrak, 407 F. Supp. 2d 671, 676 (E.D. Pa. 2005) (Stagi I).\n\n       The District Court held a discovery conference on January 2, 2006, and plaintiffs\n\nmoved to compel production of discovery material related to the qualifications of the\n\nvarious management positions as well as the work histories and other qualifications of\n\nunion employees who might have been qualified for management positions (although they\n\nmight be blocked by the one-year rule). The court held additional discovery conferences\n\non April 4, 2007 and May 4, 2007. One of the issues discussed at each conference was\n\nthe use and availability of qualifications data. Amtrak subsequently produced certain\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\femployee data in July 2007. Based in part on this data, plaintiffs submitted an expert\n\nreport by Mark R. Killingsworth on October 23, 2007. Amtrak submitted a responsive\n\nexpert report by David W. Griffin on January 25, 2008.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification under Rule 23 on February 29, 2008.\n\nBefore that motion was fully briefed, Amtrak moved for summary judgment on April 21,\n\n2008. Briefing was complete for the class certification motion on June 6, 2008 and for\n\nthe summary judgment motion on November 17, 2008. A hearing was held on July 21,\n\n2009, at which each party’s expert testified. By memorandum and order dated August 12,\n\n2009, the District Court granted Amtrak’s summary judgment motion.2 Stagi II, 2009 WL\n\n2461892, at *13. Plaintiffs timely appealed.3\n\n                                            II.\n\n                            A. Title VII and Disparate Impact\n\n       Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, it is unlawful for an employer to\n\n“limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way\n\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or\n\notherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race,\n\n       2\n         On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the District Court erred in ruling on the summary\njudgment motion when it did because the District Court had informed the parties that the\nJuly 21 hearing would be limited to questions relating to class certification. Because we\nwill reverse the District Courts’s order granting summary judgment on other grounds, we\nneed not decide this issue.\n       3\n        The District Court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and\n1343(a)(4). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                             6\n\fcolor, religion, sex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2). This prohibition\n\nagainst disparate impact is distinct from disparate treatment by an employer, which\n\nrequires a showing of discriminatory intent. Under Section 2000e-2(a)(2), an otherwise\n\nfacially neutral business practice that disproportionately affects or impacts a protected\n\ngroup may be unlawful. Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424, 431 (1971); see also\n\nLanning v. SEPTA, 181 F.3d 478, 485 (3d Cir. 1999). “Title VII strives to achieve\n\nequality of opportunity by rooting out artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary\n\nemployer-created barriers to professional development that have a discriminatory impact\n\nupon individuals.” Connecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 451 (1982) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has noted that “[i]n considering claims\n\nof disparate impact . . . this Court has consistently focused on employment and promotion\n\nrequirements that create a discriminatory bar to opportunities. This Court has never . . .\n\nrequir[ed] the focus to be placed . . . on the overall number of minority or female\n\napplicants actually hired or promoted.” Id. at 450.\n\n       A prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination has two components. First,\n\na plaintiff must identify “the specific employment practice that is challenged.” Watson v.\n\nFt. Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 994 (1988). Second, the plaintiff must show that\n\nthe employment practice “causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). To show causation, the\n\nplaintiff must present “statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fpractice in question has caused exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of\n\ntheir membership in a protected group.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 994; see also EEOC v.\n\nGreyhound Lines, 635 F.2d 188, 193 (3d Cir. 1980).\n\n       If a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to\n\nshow that the employment practice at issue is job related for the position in question and\n\nis consistent with business necessity.4 Watson, 487 U.S. at 994; 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n2(k)(1) (clarifying that to maintain a claim, plaintiff must make out a prima facie case and\n\nthe employer must then “fail[] to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related\n\nfor the position in question and consistent with business necessity”).5\n\n                                  B. The Prima Facie Case\n\n       As the District Court noted, there is no “rigid mathematical formula” courts can\n\nmandate or apply to determine whether plaintiffs have established a prima facie case.\n\nStagi II, 2009 WL 2461892, at *3. If statistical evidence is used, as it typically will be in\n\ndisparate impact cases, it must be “sufficiently substantial” to raise “an inference of\n\ncausation.” Id. (quoting Watson, 487 U.S. at 994-95). The Supreme Court has not\n\nprovided any definitive guidance about when statistical evidence is sufficiently\n\n\n\n       4\n         The District Court did not reach the issue of business necessity because it held\nthat plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case and ended its inquiry.\n       5\n         The statute also allows plaintiff to show that an alternative employment practice\nexists that has a less disparate impact and would also serve the business’s legitimate\ninterest and the employer refuses to adopt it. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(ii); Lanning,\n181 F.3d at 489-90. This alternative is not relevant here.\n\n                                              8\n\fsubstantial, but a leading treatise notes that “[t]he most widely used means of showing\n\nthat an observed disparity in outcomes is sufficiently substantial to satisfy the plaintiff’s\n\nburden of proving adverse impact is to show that the disparity is sufficiently large that it\n\nis highly unlikely to have occurred at random.” 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman,\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law 124 (4th ed. 2007) (hereinafter “Lindemann &\n\nGrossman”). This is typically done by the use of tests of statistical significance, which\n\ndetermine the probability of the observed disparity obtaining by chance.\n\n       There are two related concepts associated with statistical significance: measures of\n\nprobability levels and standard deviation. Probability levels (also called “p-values”) are\n\nsimply the probability that the observed disparity is random—the result of chance\n\nfluctuation or distribution. For example, a 0.05 probability level means that one would\n\nexpect to see the observed disparity occur by chance only one time in twenty cases—there\n\nis only a five percent chance that the disparity is random. A standard deviation is a unit\n\nof measurement that allows statisticians to measure all types of disparities in common\n\nterms.6 In this context, the greater the number of standard deviations from the mean, the\n\ngreater the likelihood that the observed result is not due to chance. To offer some sense\n\n\n       6\n         Technically, a standard deviation is defined as “a measure of spread, dispersion,\nor variability of a group of numbers equal to the square root of the variance of that group\nof numbers.” D. Baldus & J. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination 359 (1980). The\n“variance” of the group of numbers is computed by subtracting the “mean,” or average, of\nall the numbers, “squaring the resulting difference, and computing the mean of these\nsquared differences.” Id. at 361.\n\n\n                                               9\n\fof the relationship between these two measures, two standard deviations corresponds\n\nroughly to a probability level of 0.05; three standard deviations correspond to a\n\nprobability level of 0.0027. See Lindemann & Grossman 126 n.85 and accompanying\n\ntext.\n\n        As a legal matter, the Supreme Court has stated that “[a]s a general rule for . . .\n\nlarge samples, if the difference between the expected value and the observed number is\n\ngreater than two or three standard deviations, then the hypothesis that the [result] was\n\nrandom would be suspect to a social scientist.” Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.S. 482, 496\n\nn.17 (1977). Additionally, many courts accept a 0.05 probability level (or below) as\n\nsufficient to rule out the possibility that the disparity occurred at random. See, e.g.,\n\nWaisome v. Port Auth., 948 F.2d 1370, 1376 (2d Cir. 1991) (“Social scientists consider a\n\nfinding of two standard deviations significant, meaning there is about one chance in 20\n\nthat the explanation for a deviation could be random and the deviation must be accounted\n\nfor by some factor other than chance.” (citation omitted)); Palmer v. Shultz, 815 F.2d 84,\n\n92-96 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (noting that “statistical evidence meeting the .05 level of\n\nsignificance . . . [is] certainly sufficient to support an inference of discrimination”\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted, alterations in original)).\n\n        In addition to using formal measures of statistical significance, some courts have\n\nalso relied upon the “80 percent rule” from the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission’s (EEOC) Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures to assess\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fwhether a plaintiff has established a prima facie disparate impact case. See, e.g., Stout v.\n\nPotter, 276 F.3d 1118, 1124 (9th Cir. 2002) (applying “four-fifths rule” and calling it\n\n“rule of thumb” courts use when considering adverse impact of selection procedures);\n\nBoston Police Superior Officers Fed’n v. City of Boston, 147 F.3d 13, 21 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(affirming district court’s use of four-fifths rule in context of consent decree, holding that,\n\nalthough “violation of the four-fifths rule, standing alone, is not conclusive evidence of\n\ndiscrimination,” it nonetheless serves as an “appropriate benchmark”); Smith v. Xerox\n\nCorp., 196 F.3d 358, 365 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding EEOC Guidelines “persuasive”). These\n\nGuidelines are codified at 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D), entitled “Adverse impact and the ‘four-\n\nfifths rule,’” and they state, in relevant part,\n\n               A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is\n               less than four-fifths (4/5) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the\n               group with the highest rate will generally be regarded by the\n               Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of adverse impact,\n               while a greater than four-fifths rate will generally not be\n               regarded by Federal enforcement agencies as evidence of\n               adverse impact.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D).\n\n       EEOC Guidelines are entitled only to Skidmore deference, Skidmore v. Swift &\n\nCo., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), under which EEOC Guidelines “get[] deference in\n\naccordance with the thoroughness of [their] research and the persuasiveness of [their]\n\nreasoning.” El v. SEPTA, 479 F.3d 232, 244 (3d Cir. 2007) (citing EEOC v. Arab\n\n\n\n\n                                                   11\n\fAmerican Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 257 (1991)).7 The “80 percent rule” or the “four-fifths\n\nrule” has come under substantial criticism, and has not been particularly persuasive, at\n\nleast as a prerequisite for making out a prima facie disparate impact case. The Supreme\n\nCourt has noted that “[t]his enforcement standard has been criticized on technical grounds\n\n. . . and it has not provided more than a rule of thumb for the courts.” Watson, 487 at 995\n\nn.3. See also Lindemann & Grossman 130 (noting that the 80 percent rule “is inherently\n\nless probative than standard deviation analysis”); E. Shoben, Differential Pass-Fail Rates\n\nin Employment Testing: Statistical Proof Under Title VII, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 793, 806\n\n(1978) (arguing that the “four-fifths rule should be abandoned altogether” and that “flaws\n\nin the four-fifths rule can be eliminated by replacing it with a test of . . . statistical\n\nsignificance”).\n\n       Another non-statistical standard that has been discussed in the context of assessing\n\nwhether a plaintiff has made out a prima facie case is the requirement that the disparity\n\nhave “practical significance.” 8 For example, Lindemann and Grossman write that “[t]o\n\n       7\n          It is worth noting that although the Supreme Court initially said that EEOC\nGuidelines were entitled to “great deference,” the Supreme Court itself has made it clear\nthat this is not the case. As we noted in El v. SEPTA: “It does not appear that the\nEEOC’s Guidelines are entitled to great deference. While some early cases so held in\ninterpreting Title VII, Griggs, 401 U.S. at 434 . . . more recent cases have held that the\nEEOC is entitled only to Skidmore deference.” 479 F.3d at 244 (citing Arab American\nOil, 499 U.S. at 257).\n       8\n         A related concern, that the statistical disparity be “substantial,” has been held out\nas an additional requirement for a plaintiff’s prima facie case. See, e.g., Thomas v.\nMetroflight, Inc., 814 F.2d 1506, 1511 n.4 (10th Cir.1987) (suggesting that courts may\nrequire, in addition to statistical significance, that the observed disparity be substantial).\n\n                                                12\n\fguard against the possibility that a finding of adverse impact could result from the\n\nstatistical significance of a trivial disparity or a meaningless difference in results, the\n\nUniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures and some courts have adopted an\n\nadditional test for adverse impact: that a statistically significant disparity also has\n\npractical significance.” Lindemann & Grossman 131 (citations omitted).\n\n       We can identify no Court of Appeals that has found “practical significance” to be a\n\nrequirement for a plaintiff’s prima facie case of disparate impact, including the Third\n\n\n\n\nThis requirement, however, appears to be derived from the Supreme Court’s early\ndisparate impact cases that were decided prior to the use of formal notions of statistical\nsignificance as the means by which causation was to be demonstrated. In these early\nformulations of the causation requirement, rather than requiring a particular level of\nstatistical significance, the Supreme Court required that the relevant rule had a\n“substantially” disproportionate effect. See, e.g., Griggs, 401 U.S. at 426 (examining\n“requirements [that] operate[d] to disqualify Negroes at a substantially higher rate than\nwhite applicants”); Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 425 (1975) (plaintiffs\nare required to show “that the tests in question select applicants for hire or promotion in a\nracial pattern significantly different from that of the pool of applicants”); Washington v.\nDavis, 426 U.S. 229, 246-47 (1976) (“hiring and promotion practices disqualifying\nsubstantially disproportionate number of blacks”); Dothard v. Rawlinson, 433 U.S. 321,\n329 (1977) (employment standards that “select applicants for hire in a significantly\ndiscriminatory pattern”). The Supreme Court has made it clear that the “substantial”\nlanguage was meant to address the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate causation. As the\nSupreme Court noted in Watson, the Supreme Court’s “formulations . . . have consistently\nstressed that statistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise . . . an\ninference of causation,” in other words, that the statistical disparities are adequate to\n“show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or\npromotions because of their membership in a protected group.” 487 U.S. at 994-95\n(O’Connor, J., plurality opinion) (emphasis added). The requirement of “substantiality”\nwas not meant to introduce an additional burden on the plaintiff above that of offering\nevidence of causation.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fCircuit. The “practical significance” language stems from the EEOC Uniform Guidelines\n\non Employee Selection Procedures, which note that “[s]maller differences in selection\n\nrate may nevertheless constitute adverse impact, where they are significant in both\n\nstatistical and practical terms.” 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D) (emphasis added). However, even\n\nthe non-binding EEOC Guidelines only suggest that “practical significance” might be a\n\nrequirement when differences in the selection rate were greater than eighty percent. Id.\n\nThe one case identified by Lindemann and Grossman, Waisome, noted that the EEOC\n\nGuidelines, including the aforementioned one, “provide no more than a rule of thumb to\n\naid in determining whether an employment practice has a disparate impact.” 948 F.2d at\n\n1376 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cited in Lindemann & Grossman\n\n131 n.98. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Waisome did disregard a finding of\n\nstatistical significance (2.68 standard deviations), but on the grounds that the African-\n\nAmerican pass rate for a written examination was 87% of the white pass rate, and that the\n\nstatistical significance of the disparity would disappear if just two additional African-\n\nAmerican candidates, out of a total of 64 African-American candidates, had passed the\n\nwritten examination. 948 F.2d at 1376-77. Other courts have also found that, in cases\n\nwhere the “statistical significance” of the results would disappear if the numbers were\n\naltered very slightly, the plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case. See, e.g., Apsley\n\nv. Boeing Co., --- F. Supp.2d ---, No. 05-1368, 2010 WL 2670880, at *18 (D. Kan. June\n\n30, 2010) (noting that “[s]tatistical significance does not tell us whether the disparity we\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\fare observing is meaningful in a practical sense nor what may have caused the disparity,”\n\nand finding that because of the fact that if “forty-eight more people over the age of 40\n\nwould have been hired, Plaintiffs’ hiring statistics would not have been statistically\n\nsignificant,” plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case). As “practical” significance\n\nhas not been adopted by our Court, and no other Court of Appeals requires a showing of\n\npractical significance, we decline to require such a showing as part of a plaintiff’s prima\n\nfacie case.\n\n       In sum, to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact in a Title VII case, a\n\nplaintiff must (1) identify a specific employment policy or practice of the employer and\n\n(2) proffer evidence, typically statistical evidence, (3) of a kind and degree sufficient to\n\nshow that the practice in question has caused exclusion of applicants for jobs or\n\npromotions (4) because of their membership in a protected group. See Watson, 487 U.S.\n\nat 994. With respect to meeting her burden with respect to (3), a plaintiff will typically\n\nhave to demonstrate that the disparity in impact is sufficiently large that it is highly\n\nunlikely to have occurred at random, and to do so by using one of several tests of\n\nstatistical significance. There is no precise threshold that must be met in every case, but a\n\nfinding of statistical significance with a probability level at or below 0.05, or at 2 to 3\n\nstandard deviations or greater, will typically be sufficient. See Castaneda, 430 U.S. at\n\n496 n.17.\n\n                               III. The District Court Decision\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f       As noted above, the District Court granted Amtrak’s summary judgment motion on\n\nthe grounds that Plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of presenting a prima facie case of\n\ndisparate impact. This decision was based on two main considerations: (1) that “the\n\napplicant pool plaintiffs analyzed to demonstrate the disparate impact of Amtrak’s policy\n\nerroneously compares employees who may not have the minimal qualifications for the\n\nparticular jobs at issue,” and (2) that “when viewed in context, plaintiffs’ evidence of\n\ndiscrimination lacks practical significance.” Stagi II, 2009 WL 2461892, at *13. The\n\nDistrict Court’s reasoning behind these conclusions is nuanced and worth considering in\n\nsome detail.\n\n       The District Court, in laying out the standard for a prima facie disparate impact\n\ncase, correctly noted that the plaintiff does not need to offer proof of the employer’s\n\nsubjective intent to discriminate, but that, instead, she must “first identify the specific\n\nemployment practice that is challenged” and then she must “show causation” by offering\n\n“statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question\n\nhas caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their\n\nmembership in a protected group.” Stagi II, 2009 WL 2461892, at *3 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted). The District Court also noted that the “statistical disparities\n\nmust be sufficiently substantial such that they raise an inference of causation.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       The District Court then stated that there is no “rigid mathematical formula that\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fsatisfies the sufficiently substantial standard in the disparate impact analysis.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But rather than discuss the importance of\n\nvarious measures of statistical significance, particularly with respect to demonstrating that\n\nthe disparity is unlikely to have been the product of chance, the District Court instead\n\nreferenced the EEOC Guidelines “eighty percent” rule. The District Court stated that “the\n\nSupreme Court has indicated that the guidance of this administrative body should be\n\nconsidered with ‘great deference,’ and no consensus has developed around any alternative\n\nstandard.” Id. (quoting Griggs, 401 U.S. at 433-34). The District Court did note that this\n\nrule “is not intended to be an absolute requirement.” Id.\n\n       Applying its statement of the law to the facts of the case before it, the District\n\nCourt noted that Plaintiffs satisfied the first part of their prima facie case by identifying\n\nthe one-year rule as the specific employment practice being challenged. Id. at *4. The\n\nDistrict Court then conducted an extended discussion of the statistical evidence of\n\ndisparate impact offered by Plaintiffs in the form of the expert report of Dr.\n\nKillingsworth, and the criticism of that report by Amtrak’s expert, Dr. Griffin.\n\n       The District Court found that the one-year rule makes this situation equivalent to\n\nan “entrance requirement” case, which means that the pool of actual applicants for the\n\nposition will under-represent those who would otherwise qualify, because the requirement\n\nitself would discourage the people who are claiming that the requirement has a disparate\n\nimpact from applying. Id. at *5. The District Court noted that “[i]n such cases, it is\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fproper to establish disparate impact through reference to a reasonable proxy for the pool\n\nof individuals actually affected by the alleged discrimination.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n       The District Court then discussed Dr. Killingsworth’s method for creating proxy\n\npools. The key part of Dr. Killingsworth’s method of creating the proxy pools is this\n\nmulti-step process:\n\n       (1) Identify each management vacancy occurring during the time at issue (between\n              March 8, 2002 and June 30, 2007).\n\n       (2) Of that full set of vacancies, isolate the vacancies that were filled by a union\n              employee (which we will refer to as a “job fill”).\n\n       (3) For each successful union employee, identify the job title that the union\n              employee had prior to getting the management job (which we will refer to\n              as a “feeder job”).\n\n       (4) Define a “Feeder Pool” for a particular management vacancy as the set of\n              people who had the same job title as the successful candidate for that\n              vacancy on the date just before the vacancy was filled.\n\nDr. Killingsworth’s model, using the above approach, identified 716 separate “Feeder\n\nPools,” each tied to a specific management vacancy, at a specific point in time. Each\n\nentry in a pool is called a “candidacy,” rather than a candidate or person because the same\n\npotential applicants (or people) could be in more than one Feeder Pool. After discussing\n\nDr. Killingsworth’s method of creating the Feeder Pools, the District Court found that\n\n“[b]ased on the information provided to Dr. Killingsworth by Amtrak, plaintiffs’ method\n\nis a reasonable one.” Id. at *6.\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       The District Court objected, however, to Dr. Killingsworth’s decision to\n\n“aggregate” all of the individual Feeder Pools into “one giant pool” (the “Aggregated\n\nPool”) in order to analyze “the degree to which the Policy disqualified women in the\n\nAggregated Pool relative to men.” Id. Specifically, Dr. Killingsworth combined all 716\n\nindividual Feeder Pools into one large pool in order to conduct his statistical analysis.\n\nThe District Court noted that when Dr. Killingsworth analyzed the data using a “corrected\n\nprobit analysis” (which corrects for the fact that the same individual might appear in more\n\nthan one pool), the results yielded a standard deviation of 3.855, with a p-value of less\n\nthan 0.001—results which the District Court acknowledged were “unlikely to have\n\noccurred as a result of chance alone.” 9 Id.\n\n       Despite the statistical significance of this result, however, the District Court found\n\nthat Plaintiffs had not done enough to carry their prima facie burden. First, the District\n\nCourt was convinced by Amtrak’s argument that Dr. Killingsworth’s analysis was flawed,\n\nand that the statistical significance of his result was thus irrelevant. Amtrak’s expert, Dr.\n\nGriffin, offered a report demonstrating that if one does not combine the 716 Feeder Pools\n\ninto one large Aggregated Pool, and if, instead, one just examines whether women in each\n\nindividual Feeder Pool were ineligible at a greater than expected level (given the\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         The District Court also noted that using an “uncorrected” conventional chi-square\ntest to analyze the data, Dr. Killingsworth’s results were even more statistically\nsignificant (in terms of being unlikely to have occurred at random), with a standard\ndeviation measure of 8.42.\n\n                                               19\n\fineligibility rate of that particular pool), one does not find that women were\n\ndisadvantaged relative to men at a statistically significant level.\n\n       Dr. Griffin determined this by first determining the percentage of ineligible men\n\nand women in a particular Feeder Pool (i.e., if 50 out of 500 people are blocked, the total\n\nineligibility rate would be 10%). Next, Dr. Griffin multiplied that percentage by the total\n\nnumber of women in the pool to determine the number of “expected” ineligibles (i.e., if\n\nthere were 300 women in the pool, multiplied by 10%, one would expect 30 women in the\n\npool to be ineligible). Finally, Dr. Griffin compared the “expected” number of ineligible\n\nwomen with the actual number of ineligible women in the pool, to assess whether there\n\nwas a shortfall or a surplus of ineligible women in that particular pool, relative to what\n\nwas expected (i.e., if 20 women were actually ineligible, then there would be a shortfall\n\nof 10 women—10 fewer women were ineligible than would be expected given the Feeder\n\nPool’s particular ineligibility rate as a whole).\n\n       Having conducted this analysis for approximately 600 “job fills,” Dr. Griffin then\n\nsummed the surpluses and shortfalls of ineligible women across those approximately 600\n\n“job fills.” This resulted in a net surplus of 6.2 ineligible women, meaning that 6.2 fewer\n\nwomen were promotion eligible than would have been if there were perfect gender parity\n\nacross all 600 job fills. As the District Court noted, “[s]ix fewer promotion eligible\n\nfemales across 600 plus ‘job fills’ is not statistically significant by any measure, and does\n\nnot support an inference of discrimination.” Id. at *8 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       At this point, the District Court noted that “the parties have merely presented two\n\ndifferent statistical models that produce opposite results,” and that “[s]imply\n\ndemonstrating that an alternative analysis leads to alternative results is not sufficient to\n\ndefeat a plaintiff’s prima facie case—the defendant must also show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact that plaintiffs’ model is fundamentally flawed for the\n\npurpose of demonstrating disparate impact in the case at issue.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\nThe District Court continued:\n\n              The key difference between the experts can be boiled down to\n              this: Dr. Griffin looks at whether women applying to job X\n              are disadvantaged relative to men applying to job X, whereas\n              Dr. Killingsworth analyzes whether women applying to jobs\n              X and Y are disadvantaged relative to men applying for jobs\n              X and Y, combined. When seen in those terms, the difference\n              between the expert analysis presented in this case is simply a\n              question of whether the plaintiffs have analyzed the\n              appropriate relevant labor pool for purposes of comparison.\n              This question can be decided as a matter of law.\n\nId. at *9. Essentially, the District Court saw itself as forced to decide whether Dr.\n\nKillingsworth’s decision to aggregate the 716 Feeder Pools into one Aggregate Pool was\n\nappropriate, and considered this to be a question of law.\n\n       The District Court noted that “[a]ggregated statistical data may be properly used to\n\nprove disparate impact where it is more probative than subdivided data,” id. (citing Paige\n\nv. California, 291 F.3d 1141, 1148 (9th Cir. 2002)), but that “‘[w]hen special\n\nqualifications are required to fill particular jobs, comparisons to the general population\n\n(rather than to the smaller group of individuals who possess the necessary qualifications)\n\n                                              21\n\fmay have little probative value.’” Id. (quoting Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. U.S., 433 U.S.\n\n299, 308 n. 13 (1977)). The District Court then stated that Dr. Killingsworth\n\nacknowledged that every union employee was not fungible for purposes of promotion,\n\nsince he created the 716 Feeder Pools, “otherwise he would have simply compared all\n\nunion employees across the board.” Id. The District Court contended that because Dr.\n\nKillingsworth takes the “distinctions between job categories [to be] important . . . then the\n\ndefendant’s argument that these distinctions should be maintained throughout the analysis\n\nrings true.” Id. Accordingly, the District Court found that “because plaintiffs’ analysis is\n\nfocused on an overbroad and incomparable pool of employees, it lacks the statistical\n\nsignificance necessary to make out a prima facie case of discrimination.” Id. at *11.\n\n       In the alternative, the District Court found that “[e]ven if Dr. Killingsworth’s\n\nmethodology was sound and his results recognized as having ‘statistical significance,’ the\n\nresults of his analysis are undermined by a lack of practical significance.” Id. at *12. To\n\nreach this conclusion, the District Court credited Dr. Griffin’s calculation that if female\n\ncandidates in the Aggregated Pool had the same eligibility rate as male candidates, this\n\nwould have translated to a “gender gap” of only 726 additional female promotion-eligible\n\ncandidacies (not necessarily equal to the number of affected individual people or\n\ncandidates) overall. The District Court also noted that, under the EEOC Guidelines’ “80\n\npercent rule,” the adverse impact ratio’s “practical significance is of limited magnitude,”\n\nsince the ratio here was 96.8 percent—well over the 80 percent baseline. Id.\n\n\n\n                                             22\n\f       In conclusion, the District Court found that “the applicant pool plaintiffs analyzed\n\nto demonstrate the disparate impact of Amtrak’s policy erroneously compares employees\n\nwho may not have the minimal qualifications for the particular jobs at issue,” and that\n\n“plaintiffs’ evidence of discrimination lacks practical significance.” Id. at *13. The\n\nCourt therefore granted Amtrak’s motion for summary judgment.\n\n                                             IV.\n\n       We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. See, e.g., Slagle\n\nv. County of Clarion, 435 F.3d 262, 263 (3d Cir. 2006). Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact.” The moving party “bears the initial responsibility of\n\ninforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of\n\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\n\nwith the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.” El, 479 F.3d at 237 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323\n\n(1986)). The court must draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. Id. at\n\n238. “If the moving party successfully points to evidence of all of the facts needed to\n\ndecide the case on the law short of trial, the non-moving party can defeat summary\n\njudgment if it nonetheless produces or points to evidence in the record that creates a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.” Id. “Thus, if there is a chance that a reasonable\n\nfactfinder would not accept a moving party’s necessary propositions of fact, pre-trial\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fjudgment cannot be granted.” Id.\n\n       We find that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the one-year\n\nrule caused a disparate impact on female employees. Accordingly, although it is a close\n\ncase, we find that the District Court should not have granted Amtrak’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment based on this record.\n\n       As noted above, to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact in a Title VII\n\ncase, a plaintiff must (1) identify a specific employment policy or practice of the\n\nemployer and (2) proffer evidence, typically statistical evidence, (3) of a kind and degree\n\nsufficient to show that the practice in question has caused exclusion of applicants for jobs\n\nor promotions (4) because of their membership in a protected group. To establish (3), a\n\nplaintiff will typically have to demonstrate that the disparity in impact is sufficiently large\n\nthat it is highly unlikely to have occurred at random, and to do so by using one of several\n\ntests of statistical significance. A plaintiff need not demonstrate that the disparate impact\n\nratio satisfies the EEOC’s 80 percent rule (the figure at which or below the EEOC will\n\npresume the existence of disparate impact). As noted above, the EEOC Guidelines are\n\nnot entitled to great deference, but to Skidmore deference, under which EEOC Guidelines\n\n“get[] deference in accordance with the thoroughness of [their] research and the\n\npersuasiveness of [their] reasoning.” El, 479 F.3d at 244 (citing EEOC v. Arab American\n\nOil Co., 499 U.S. at 257). The 80 percent rule has come under significant criticism and\n\nwe do not find the reasoning that might support its application here persuasive in light of\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fthe statistical significance of Dr. Killingsworth’s results.\n\n       Similarly, this Court has never established “practical significance” as an\n\nindependent requirement for a plaintiff’s prima facie disparate impact case, and we\n\ndecline to do so here. The EEOC Guidelines themselves do not set out “practical”\n\nsignificance as an independent requirement, and we find that in a case in which the\n\nstatistical significance of some set of results is clear, there is no need to probe for\n\nadditional “practical” significance. Statistical significance is relevant because it allows a\n\nfact-finder to be confident that the relationship between some rule or policy and some set\n\nof disparate impact results was not the product of chance. This goes to the plaintiff’s\n\nburden of introducing statistical evidence that is “sufficiently substantial” to raise “an\n\ninference of causation.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 994-95. There is no additional requirement\n\nthat the disparate impact caused be above some threshold level of practical significance.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court erred in ruling “in the alternative” that the absence of\n\npractical significance was fatal to Plaintiffs’ case.\n\n       There is no question that Dr. Killingsworth’s results, if the product of a relevant\n\nand otherwise compelling statistical analysis, are statistically significant above the\n\nthreshold that courts have required.10 As noted above, when Dr. Killingsworth analyzed\n\nthe data using a corrected probit analysis, the results yielded a standard deviation of\n\n\n\n\n       10\n        Even Amtrak concedes that the results, if they stand, meet the threshold\nrequirement for statistical significance. Oral Arg. Tr., 47-48.\n\n                                              25\n\f3.855, with a p-value of less than 0.001—meaning the results are incredibly unlikely to\n\nhave occurred as a result of chance alone. The Supreme Court has suggested that a\n\nstandard deviation between 2 and 3 would be sufficient, and Dr. Killingsworth’s results\n\nare considerably above that. See, e.g., Castaneda, 430 U.S. at 496 n.17.\n\n       Thus, the only issue is whether the District Court was correct in finding that Dr.\n\nKillingsworth’s statistical analysis was, in effect, legally irrelevant to satisfying Plaintiffs’\n\nburden with respect to their prima facie case because his analysis used aggregation, and in\n\nparticular the Aggregated Pool, in conducting his statistical analysis. We find that Dr.\n\nKillingsworth’s decision to aggregate the data, although not obviously correct, is also not\n\nobviously incorrect, and so there remains a genuine issue of material fact—whether the\n\none-year rule caused a disparate impact on Amtrak’s female employees.\n\n        The one-year rule applies to all union employees. However, including all union\n\nemployees in the statistical sample would have been inappropriate, since many of them\n\nmay not have been even remote candidates for any management position. To identify all\n\nthose union employees who might reasonably be thought to be candidates for a\n\nmanagement position, Dr. Killingsworth identified those candidates who obtained a\n\nmanagement position during the relevant five-year span, and then identified the previous\n\nunion positions held by those candidates. At that point, Dr. Killingsworth assumed, and\n\nthe District Court found this assumption reasonable, that all those individuals who were in\n\nthe same union position as the position that the successful candidate had previously\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\foccupied might reasonably be thought to have been a possible candidate for the\n\nmanagement position that the successful candidate actually obtained. Thus, if Smith was\n\nhired into Management Position One, and Smith had previously been in Union Position\n\nOne, Dr. Killingsworth assumed that all other individuals—Jones, Williams, Johnson,\n\netc.—who had been in Union Position One were possible candidates for Management\n\nPosition One. This is not a perfect proxy, as all parties concede. For example, Smith\n\nmight have had much more experience than Jones and Williams, or he might have\n\neducational degrees that they lack. But, given that the one-year rule operates as an initial\n\nbar from even becoming a candidate for a job, the only way to measure its effect is to\n\ndevise some way of identifying those who might reasonably be thought to have been\n\npossible candidates were it not for the existence of the one-year rule. We agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that Dr. Killingsworth’s method here was reasonable.\n\n       It is true that while “the population selected for statistical analysis need not\n\nperfectly match the pool of qualified persons,” without “a close fit between the population\n\nused to measure disparate impact and the population of those qualified for a benefit, the\n\nstatistical results cannot be persuasive.” Carpenter v. Boeing Co., 456 F.3d 1183, 1196\n\n(10th Cir. 2006). One must have the proper pool of people in view before performing\n\nstatistical analysis, or that analysis will be irrelevant. This, however, goes to the issue of\n\nwhether Dr. Killingsworth’s use of the individual Feeder Pools was reasonable or not. In\n\ndiscussing this issue, the District Court stated:\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f              In the absence of explicit measures of qualifications and job\n              interest, Dr. Killingsworth assumed that information about the\n              position held prior to promotion could reasonably serve as an\n              indicator of qualifications and job interest. Based on the\n              information provided to Dr. Killingsworth by Amtrak,\n              plaintiffs’ method is a reasonable one.\n\nStagi II, 2009 WL 2461892, at *6. We agree.\n\n       Where the District Court identified a problem was with the combining of the\n\nindividual Feeder Pools into one Aggregated Pool. The District Court stated that because\n\nDr. Killingsworth takes the “distinctions between job categories [to be] important” in\n\ncreating the individual Feeder Pools, “then the defendant’s argument that these\n\ndistinctions should be maintained throughout the analysis rings true.” Id. at *9. Amtrak’s\n\ncounsel made this same point repeatedly at oral argument, stating that “if you’re going to\n\nlive in a stratified world, you have to follow that stratified world through to your analysis”\n\nand that “the problem is that we’re aggregating after we stratify, that’s the heart of the\n\nmatter.” Oral Arg. Tr., at 41, 45.\n\n       However, neither the District Court nor Amtrak’s counsel has offered a convincing\n\nexplanation of why the use of aggregated data in this case is improper. The District Court\n\nreintroduces the “qualifications” issue, asserting that “[t]he single aggregated statistic Dr.\n\nKillingsworth relies on compares individuals who may never actually be in competition\n\nfor the same jobs, and does not accurately account for what job the employee in question\n\nis coming from, where they are looking to go, and what the relevant qualifications are.”\n\nStagi II, 2009 WL 2461892, at *9. But this criticism misses its target. Creating the\n\n                                              28\n\fAggregated Pool out of the individual Feeder Pools does not erroneously imply that a\n\nperson from Feeder Pool A (created based on Management Position A) is a possible\n\ncandidate, along with the members of Feeder Pool B, for Management Position B.\n\nRather, it just puts together all of those people (or candidacies, more precisely) who are in\n\nunion positions currently, and who are reasonably thought of as possible candidates for\n\nsome management position or other. All of these people are susceptible to the one-year\n\nrule, and thus all of them are potentially “blocked” by its uniform application if they have\n\nserved less than one year in their respective union positions. Aggregating the individual\n\nFeeder Pools in this way appears to be no more problematic, at least with respect to the\n\nissue of qualifications, than doing what Dr. Griffin did when he simply “added up” the\n\ndifference between the expected ineligibility rate and the actual ineligibility rate for each\n\nof the 600 plus individual Feeder Pools.\n\n       At various points, Amtrak’s counsel at oral argument appeared to be arguing that,\n\nas a matter of consistency, once one has subdivided the pool into categories, one ought\n\nnot to recombine those categories into an aggregate pool. The District Court appeared to\n\naccept a similar line of thought when it noted that because Dr. Killingsworth took the\n\n“distinctions between job categories [to be] important” in creating the individual Feeder\n\nPools, “then the defendant’s argument that these distinctions should be maintained\n\nthroughout the analysis rings true.” Id. at *9. But there has been no argument made that\n\nsomehow the statistical analysis is corrupted if one “changes horses” from a stratified to\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fan aggregated analysis midstream. Indeed, Amtrak’s counsel explicitly stated that “the\n\nactual manner in which [Dr. Killingsworth] performs the numbers is not incorrect, it’s the\n\nunderlying numbers that are the problem.” Oral Arg. Tr., at 44. Finally, Plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel stresses that they never were doing a “stratification” analysis in the first place, but\n\nthat they were simply attempting to “define what is the subset of total union employees\n\nwho seemed to be in positions that made them eligible to seek promotion.” Id. at 56.\n\n       A final possible reason to object to the use of aggregated data is presented by the\n\nDistrict Court when it notes that Dr. Griffin’s report suggests that there are some Feeder\n\nPools in which fewer women than men were made ineligible by the one-year rule, and\n\nsome in which the reverse was true, and that the overall result of women doing worse\n\nthan men (at least under Dr. Killingsworth’s model) obscures these facts. This would be\n\na reason against aggregating insofar as aggregating produces a misleading picture of the\n\noverall situation for women. (As one court has noted, “[i]f Microsoft-founder Bill Gates\n\nand nine monks are together in a room, it is accurate to say that on average the people in\n\nthe room are extremely well-to-do, but this kind of aggregate analysis obscures the fact\n\nthat ninety percent of the people in the room have taken a vow of poverty.” Abram v.\n\nUnited Parcel Serv. Inc., 200 F.R.D. 424, 431 (E.D. Wis. 2001).) For example, it might\n\nbe that in 400 of the 716 Feeder Pools, women are made ineligible at a rate significantly\n\ngreater than that of men, and that in 316 of the Feeder Pools, the reverse is true. In such a\n\nsituation, the one-year rule appears to have a disparate impact on women only in a subset\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\fof the 716 Feeder Pools.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ second expert, Ramona Paetzold, submitted an affidavit arguing that\n\nstratification is inappropriate in this case precisely because of this possibility. In\n\nparticular, stratification is inappropriate because the numbers of women in each feeder\n\njob at any given point in time is determined, in part, by the existence of the one-year rule\n\nitself, “because the one-year rule at least partially affects how long men and women must\n\nremain in the feeder job before being eligible for promotion.” Paetzold Aff. 3. The\n\nDistrict Court contends that this is a problem for Plaintiffs, because “the gender\n\ncomposition of feeder jobs may very well be affected by additional factors such as wage\n\nlevels, working conditions, movement prospects, layoffs, and the union’s collectible\n\nbargaining agreement that allows unrestricted lateral job movements among union\n\nemployees, none of which the plaintiffs have made any attempt to identify or control for\n\nin their analysis.” Stagi II, 2009 WL 2461892, at *10. But this seems to be a problem\n\nonly if the reasons against aggregation are compelling. There is no legal requirement to\n\nuse the smallest possible unit of analysis. If there are additional factors (such as seniority\n\nrules)—apart from just the one-year rule—that are determining the composition of the\n\nindividual Feeder Pools in a “gendered” way, these factors may aid Amtrak in mounting a\n\nbusiness justification defense, but it is inappropriate to require Plaintiffs to control for\n\nevery possible such factor in order to sustain their burden of proving a prima facie case.\n\nIf the aggregated data yields a statistically significant finding, such as the one here, that\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\fthe one-year rule is having a disparate impact on women, and there is no compelling\n\nreason to avoid use of aggregated data, that is enough for Plaintiffs to establish their\n\nprima facie case.\n\n       Additionally, there may be good reasons to aggregate data in a case such as\n\nthis—reasons that have nothing to do with simply picking and choosing the model which\n\nwill generate the most favorable results for plaintiffs’ case. Perhaps most significantly, as\n\nthe Fourth Circuit has observed, “by increasing the absolute numbers in the data, chance\n\nwill more readily be excluded as a cause of any disparities found.” Lilly v. Harris-Teeter\n\nSupermarket, 720 F.2d 326, 336 n.17 (4th Cir. 1983). This makes intuitive sense. “For\n\nexample, if a coin were tossed ten times . . . and came up heads four times, no one would\n\nthink the coin was biased (0.632 standard deviations), but if this same ratio occurred for a\n\ntotal of 10,000 tosses, of which 4,000 were heads, the result could not be attributed to\n\nchance (20 standard deviations).” Id. Here, by combining all of those candidacies in the\n\n716 Feeder Pools into one Aggregated Pool, Dr. Killingsworth was better able to test\n\nwhether the difference in the ineligibility rate for men and women was merely the product\n\nof chance. Many courts have found such a reason for aggregating compelling. See, e.g.,\n\nEldredge v. Carpenters 46 N. California Counties Joint Apprenticeship and Training\n\nComm., 833 F.2d 1334, 1339 (9th Cir. 1987) (“Aggregated data presents a more complete\n\nand reliable picture.”); Cook v. Boorstin, 763 F.2d 1462, 1468-69 (D.C. Cir. 1985)\n\n(rejecting defendant’s argument to restrict statistical analysis to particular job categories);\n\n\n\n                                              32\n\fCapaci v. Katz & Besthoff, 711 F.2d 647, 654 (5th Cir. 1983) (allowing a plan to\n\naggregate data over several years because aggregation was necessary in order to\n\naccomplish a meaningful statistical analysis).\n\n       At a minimum, we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether\n\nthe one-year rule caused a disparate impact on female employees. It is possible that there\n\nare reasons to prefer Dr. Griffin’s methodology to Dr. Killingsworth’s methodology,\n\ngiven that they yield conflicting conclusions regarding whether the one-year rule has an\n\nall-things-considered disparate impact on women. But we cannot so conclude on this\n\nrecord, and the reasons presented by the District Court for finding that Plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to make out a prima facie case do not withstand scrutiny. Accordingly, we find that\n\nthe District Court should not have granted Amtrak’s motion for summary judgment based\n\non this record.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       We will reverse the judgment of the District Court granting Amtrak’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment and will remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f",

The policy states,\n\n“[a]n agreement covered employee may not apply for a posted non-agreement covered\n\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fposition unless he or she has been in his or her current union for one year.” App. 299.1\n\nThe rule has no exceptions. The rule was first promulgated on May 1, 1994 and was\n\nrevised in September 2000, which revision was in force during the time period relevant\n\nfor this case.\n\n       Plaintiffs Stagi and Ladd are long-time Amtrak employees who have been\n\nemployed in both its union and management ranks during their careers. Stagi began her\n\ncareer at Amtrak in 1973 as a reservation and information clerk, and eventually worked\n\nher way up to various union positions until the early 1990s, when she was promoted to a\n\nmanagement position. She was in a management position in April 2002 when she was\n\nlaid off as a result of a corporate-wide management restructuring effort. Ladd was\n\npromoted to management in 1986 and continued to be promoted through management\n\nuntil April 2002, when her job was similarly eliminated. Because they had previously\n\nworked in Amtrak’s union ranks, they were both entitled to “bump down” into a union\n\nposition based on their retained union seniority. In the year following their layoffs, both\n\napplied for management vacancies, some of which they had previously held or\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Although the policy says “in his or her current union[,]” the parties agree that the\npolicy has been interpreted and applied by Amtrak as blocking an employee who has not\nbeen in his or her current union position for at least one year.

Lindemann & P. Grossman,\n\nEmployment Discrimination Law 124 (4th ed. 2007) (hereinafter “Lindemann &\n\nGrossman”). This is typically done by the use of tests of statistical significance, which\n\ndetermine the probability of the observed disparity obtaining by chance.\n\n       There are two related concepts associated with statistical significance: measures of\n\nprobability levels and standard deviation. Probability levels (also called “p-values”) are\n\nsimply the probability that the observed disparity is random—the result of chance\n\nfluctuation or distribution. For example, a 0.05 probability level means that one would\n\nexpect to see the observed disparity occur by chance only one time in twenty cases—there\n\nis only a five percent chance that the disparity is random. A standard deviation is a unit\n\nof measurement that allows statisticians to measure all types of disparities in common\n\nterms.6 In this context, the greater the number of standard deviations from the mean, the\n\ngreater the likelihood that the observed result is not due to chance. To offer some sense\n\n\n       6\n         Technically, a standard deviation is defined as “a measure of spread, dispersion,\nor variability of a group of numbers equal to the square root of the variance of that group\nof numbers.” D. Baldus & J. Cole, Statistical Proof of Discrimination 359 (1980). The\n“variance” of the group of numbers is computed by subtracting the “mean,” or average, of\nall the numbers, “squaring the resulting difference, and computing the mean of these\nsquared differences.” Id. at 361.\n\n\n                                               9\n\fof the relationship between these two measures, two standard deviations corresponds\n\nroughly to a probability level of 0.05; three standard deviations correspond to a\n\nprobability level of 0.0027. See Lindemann & Grossman 126 n.85 and accompanying\n\ntext.\n\n        As a legal matter, the Supreme Court has stated that “[a]s a general rule for . . .\n\nlarge samples, if the difference between the expected value and the observed number is\n\ngreater than two or three standard deviations, then the hypothesis that the [result] was\n\nrandom would be suspect to a social scientist.” Castaneda v.

In these early\nformulations of the causation requirement, rather than requiring a particular level of\nstatistical significance, the Supreme Court required that the relevant rule had a\n“substantially” disproportionate effect.

The Supreme Court has made it clear that the “substantial”\nlanguage was meant to address the plaintiff’s burden to demonstrate causation. As the\nSupreme Court noted in Watson, the Supreme Court’s “formulations . . . have consistently\nstressed that statistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise . . . an\ninference of causation,” in other words, that the statistical disparities are adequate to\n“show that the practice in question has caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or\npromotions because of their membership in a protected group.” 487 U.S. at 994-95\n(O’Connor, J., plurality opinion) (emphasis added). The requirement of “substantiality”\nwas not meant to introduce an additional burden on the plaintiff above that of offering\nevidence of causation.\n\n\n                                               13\n\fCircuit. The “practical significance” language stems from the EEOC Uniform Guidelines\n\non Employee Selection Procedures, which note that “[s]maller differences in selection\n\nrate may nevertheless constitute adverse impact, where they are significant in both\n\nstatistical and practical terms.” 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4(D) (emphasis added). However, even\n\nthe non-binding EEOC Guidelines only suggest that “practical significance” might be a\n\nrequirement when differences in the selection rate were greater than eighty percent. Id.\n\nThe one case identified by Lindemann and Grossman, Waisome, noted that the EEOC\n\nGuidelines, including the aforementioned one, “provide no more than a rule of thumb to\n\naid in determining whether an employment practice has a disparate impact.” 948 F.2d at\n\n1376 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), cited in Lindemann & Grossman\n\n131 n.98. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Waisome did disregard a finding of\n\nstatistical significance (2.68 standard deviations), but on the grounds that the African-\n\nAmerican pass rate for a written examination was 87% of the white pass rate, and that the\n\nstatistical significance of the disparity would disappear if just two additional African-\n\nAmerican candidates, out of a total of 64 African-American candidates, had passed the\n\nwritten examination. 948 F.2d at 1376-77. Other courts have also found that, in cases\n\nwhere the “statistical significance” of the results would disappear if the numbers were\n\naltered very slightly, the plaintiff failed to make out a prima facie case. See, e.g., Apsley\n\nv. Boeing Co., --- F. Supp.2d ---, No. 05-1368, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2670880</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18 (D.

With respect to meeting her burden with respect to (3), a plaintiff will typically\n\nhave to demonstrate that the disparity in impact is sufficiently large that it is highly\n\nunlikely to have occurred at random, and to do so by using one of several tests of\n\nstatistical significance. There is no precise threshold that must be met in every case, but a\n\nfinding of statistical significance with a probability level at or below 0.05, or at 2 to 3\n\nstandard deviations or greater, will typically be sufficient.

This decision was based on two main considerations: (1) that “the\n\napplicant pool plaintiffs analyzed to demonstrate the disparate impact of Amtrak’s policy\n\nerroneously compares employees who may not have the minimal qualifications for the\n\nparticular jobs at issue,” and (2) that “when viewed in context, plaintiffs’ evidence of\n\ndiscrimination lacks practical significance.” Stagi II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2461892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *13. The\n\nDistrict Court’s reasoning behind these conclusions is nuanced and worth considering in\n\nsome detail.\n\n       The District Court, in laying out the standard for a prima facie disparate impact\n\ncase, correctly noted that the plaintiff does not need to offer proof of the employer’s\n\nsubjective intent to discriminate, but that, instead, she must “first identify the specific\n\nemployment practice that is challenged” and then she must “show causation” by offering\n\n“statistical evidence of a kind and degree sufficient to show that the practice in question\n\nhas caused the exclusion of applicants for jobs or promotions because of their\n\nmembership in a protected group.” Stagi II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2461892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citations omitted). The District Court also noted that the “statistical disparities\n\nmust be sufficiently substantial such that they raise an inference of causation.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n       The District Court then stated that there is no “rigid mathematical formula that\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fsatisfies the sufficiently substantial standard in the disparate impact analysis.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). But rather than discuss the importance of\n\nvarious measures of statistical significance, particularly with respect to demonstrating that\n\nthe disparity is unlikely to have been the product of chance, the District Court instead\n\nreferenced the EEOC Guidelines “eighty percent” rule. The District Court stated that “the\n\nSupreme Court has indicated that the guidance of this administrative body should be\n\nconsidered with ‘great deference,’ and no consensus has developed around any alternative\n\nstandard.” Id. (quoting Griggs, 401 U.S. at 433-34). The District Court did note that this\n\nrule “is not intended to be an absolute requirement.” Id.\n\n       Applying its statement of the law to the facts of the case before it, the District\n\nCourt noted that Plaintiffs satisfied the first part of their prima facie case by identifying\n\nthe one-year rule as the specific employment practice being challenged. Id. at *4. The\n\nDistrict Court then conducted an extended discussion of the statistical evidence of\n\ndisparate impact offered by Plaintiffs in the form of the expert report of Dr.\n\nKillingsworth, and the criticism of that report by Amtrak’s expert, Dr. Griffin.\n\n       The District Court found that the one-year rule makes this situation equivalent to\n\nan “entrance requirement” case, which means that the pool of actual applicants for the\n\nposition will under-represent those who would otherwise qualify, because the requirement\n\nitself would discourage the people who are claiming that the requirement has a disparate\n\nimpact from applying. Id. at *5. The District Court noted that “[i]n such cases, it is\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\fproper to establish disparate impact through reference to a reasonable proxy for the pool\n\nof individuals actually affected by the alleged discrimination.” Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n       The District Court then discussed Dr. Killingsworth’s method for creating proxy\n\npools. The key part of Dr. Killingsworth’s method of creating the proxy pools is this\n\nmulti-step process:\n\n       (1) Identify each management vacancy occurring during the time at issue (between\n              March 8, 2002 and June 30, 2007).\n\n       (2) Of that full set of vacancies, isolate the vacancies that were filled by a union\n              employee (which we will refer to as a “job fill”).\n\n       (3) For each successful union employee, identify the job title that the union\n              employee had prior to getting the management job (which we will refer to\n              as a “feeder job”).\n\n       (4) Define a “Feeder Pool” for a particular management vacancy as the set of\n              people who had the same job title as the successful candidate for that\n              vacancy on the date just before the vacancy was filled.\n\nDr. Killingsworth’s model, using the above approach, identified 716 separate “Feeder\n\nPools,” each tied to a specific management vacancy, at a specific point in time. Each\n\nentry in a pool is called a “candidacy,” rather than a candidate or person because the same\n\npotential applicants (or people) could be in more than one Feeder Pool. After discussing\n\nDr. Killingsworth’s method of creating the Feeder Pools, the District Court found that\n\n“[b]ased on the information provided to Dr. Killingsworth by Amtrak, plaintiffs’ method\n\nis a reasonable one.” Id. at *6.\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       The District Court objected, however, to Dr. Killingsworth’s decision to\n\n“aggregate” all of the individual Feeder Pools into “one giant pool” (the “Aggregated\n\nPool”) in order to analyze “the degree to which the Policy disqualified women in the\n\nAggregated Pool relative to men.” Id. Specifically, Dr. Killingsworth combined all 716\n\nindividual Feeder Pools into one large pool in order to conduct his statistical analysis.\n\nThe District Court noted that when Dr. Killingsworth analyzed the data using a “corrected\n\nprobit analysis” (which corrects for the fact that the same individual might appear in more\n\nthan one pool), the results yielded a standard deviation of 3.855, with a p-value of less\n\nthan 0.001—results which the District Court acknowledged were “unlikely to have\n\noccurred as a result of chance alone.” 9 Id.\n\n       Despite the statistical significance of this result, however, the District Court found\n\nthat Plaintiffs had not done enough to carry their prima facie burden. First, the District\n\nCourt was convinced by Amtrak’s argument that Dr. Killingsworth’s analysis was flawed,\n\nand that the statistical significance of his result was thus irrelevant. Amtrak’s expert, Dr.\n\nGriffin, offered a report demonstrating that if one does not combine the 716 Feeder Pools\n\ninto one large Aggregated Pool, and if, instead, one just examines whether women in each\n\nindividual Feeder Pool were ineligible at a greater than expected level (given the\n\n\n\n\n       9\n         The District Court also noted that using an “uncorrected” conventional chi-square\ntest to analyze the data, Dr. Killingsworth’s results were even more statistically\nsignificant (in terms of being unlikely to have occurred at random), with a standard\ndeviation measure of 8.42.\n\n                                               19\n\fineligibility rate of that particular pool), one does not find that women were\n\ndisadvantaged relative to men at a statistically significant level.\n\n       Dr. Griffin determined this by first determining the percentage of ineligible men\n\nand women in a particular Feeder Pool (i.e., if 50 out of 500 people are blocked, the total\n\nineligibility rate would be 10%). Next, Dr. Griffin multiplied that percentage by the total\n\nnumber of women in the pool to determine the number of “expected” ineligibles (i.e., if\n\nthere were 300 women in the pool, multiplied by 10%, one would expect 30 women in the\n\npool to be ineligible). Finally, Dr. Griffin compared the “expected” number of ineligible\n\nwomen with the actual number of ineligible women in the pool, to assess whether there\n\nwas a shortfall or a surplus of ineligible women in that particular pool, relative to what\n\nwas expected (i.e., if 20 women were actually ineligible, then there would be a shortfall\n\nof 10 women—10 fewer women were ineligible than would be expected given the Feeder\n\nPool’s particular ineligibility rate as a whole).\n\n       Having conducted this analysis for approximately 600 “job fills,” Dr. Griffin then\n\nsummed the surpluses and shortfalls of ineligible women across those approximately 600\n\n“job fills.” This resulted in a net surplus of 6.2 ineligible women, meaning that 6.2 fewer\n\nwomen were promotion eligible than would have been if there were perfect gender parity\n\nacross all 600 job fills. As the District Court noted, “[s]ix fewer promotion eligible\n\nfemales across 600 plus ‘job fills’ is not statistically significant by any measure, and does\n\nnot support an inference of discrimination.” Id. at *8 (emphasis in original).\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\f       At this point, the District Court noted that “the parties have merely presented two\n\ndifferent statistical models that produce opposite results,” and that “[s]imply\n\ndemonstrating that an alternative analysis leads to alternative results is not sufficient to\n\ndefeat a plaintiff’s prima facie case—the defendant must also show that there is no\n\ngenuine issue of material fact that plaintiffs’ model is fundamentally flawed for the\n\npurpose of demonstrating disparate impact in the case at issue.” Id. (citation omitted).\n\nThe District Court continued:\n\n              The key difference between the experts can be boiled down to\n              this: Dr. Griffin looks at whether women applying to job X\n              are disadvantaged relative to men applying to job X, whereas\n              Dr. Killingsworth analyzes whether women applying to jobs\n              X and Y are disadvantaged relative to men applying for jobs\n              X and Y, combined. When seen in those terms, the difference\n              between the expert analysis presented in this case is simply a\n              question of whether the plaintiffs have analyzed the\n              appropriate relevant labor pool for purposes of comparison.\n              This question can be decided as a matter of law.\n\nId. at *9. Essentially, the District Court saw itself as forced to decide whether Dr.\n\nKillingsworth’s decision to aggregate the 716 Feeder Pools into one Aggregate Pool was\n\nappropriate, and considered this to be a question of law.\n\n       The District Court noted that “[a]ggregated statistical data may be properly used to\n\nprove disparate impact where it is more probative than subdivided data,” id.

The District Court then stated that Dr. Killingsworth\n\nacknowledged that every union employee was not fungible for purposes of promotion,\n\nsince he created the 716 Feeder Pools, “otherwise he would have simply compared all\n\nunion employees across the board.” Id. The District Court contended that because Dr.\n\nKillingsworth takes the “distinctions between job categories [to be] important . . . then the\n\ndefendant’s argument that these distinctions should be maintained throughout the analysis\n\nrings true.” Id.

To\n\nreach this conclusion, the District Court credited Dr. Griffin’s calculation that if female\n\ncandidates in the Aggregated Pool had the same eligibility rate as male candidates, this\n\nwould have translated to a “gender gap” of only 726 additional female promotion-eligible\n\ncandidacies (not necessarily equal to the number of affected individual people or\n\ncandidates) overall. The District Court also noted that, under the EEOC Guidelines’ “80\n\npercent rule,” the adverse impact ratio’s “practical significance is of limited magnitude,”\n\nsince the ratio here was 96.8 percent—well over the 80 percent baseline.

See, e.g., Slagle\n\nv. County of Clarion, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793028\"><a href=\"/opinion/793028/timothy-a-slagle-v-county-of-clarion-clarion-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (3d Cir. 2006). Under Rule 56(c) of the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure, summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact.” The moving party “bears the initial responsibility of\n\ninforming the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of\n\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\n\nwith the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.” El, 479 F.3d at 237 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323\n\n(1986)). The court must draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party. Id. at\n\n238. “If the moving party successfully points to evidence of all of the facts needed to\n\ndecide the case on the law short of trial, the non-moving party can defeat summary\n\njudgment if it nonetheless produces or points to evidence in the record that creates a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.” Id. “Thus, if there is a chance that a reasonable\n\nfactfinder would not accept a moving party’s necessary propositions of fact, pre-trial\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fjudgment cannot be granted.” Id.\n\n       We find that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the one-year\n\nrule caused a disparate impact on female employees. Accordingly, although it is a close\n\ncase, we find that the District Court should not have granted Amtrak’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment based on this record.\n\n       As noted above, to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact in a Title VII\n\ncase, a plaintiff must (1) identify a specific employment policy or practice of the\n\nemployer and (2) proffer evidence, typically statistical evidence, (3) of a kind and degree\n\nsufficient to show that the practice in question has caused exclusion of applicants for jobs\n\nor promotions (4) because of their membership in a protected group. To establish (3), a\n\nplaintiff will typically have to demonstrate that the disparity in impact is sufficiently large\n\nthat it is highly unlikely to have occurred at random, and to do so by using one of several\n\ntests of statistical significance. A plaintiff need not demonstrate that the disparate impact\n\nratio satisfies the EEOC’s 80 percent rule (the figure at which or below the EEOC will\n\npresume the existence of disparate impact). As noted above, the EEOC Guidelines are\n\nnot entitled to great deference, but to Skidmore deference, under which EEOC Guidelines\n\n“get[] deference in accordance with the thoroughness of [their] research and the\n\npersuasiveness of [their] reasoning.” El, 479 F.3d at 244 (citing EEOC v. Arab American\n\nOil Co., 499 U.S. at 257). The 80 percent rule has come under significant criticism and\n\nwe do not find the reasoning that might support its application here persuasive in light of\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\fthe statistical significance of Dr. Killingsworth’s results.\n\n       Similarly, this Court has never established “practical significance” as an\n\nindependent requirement for a plaintiff’s prima facie disparate impact case, and we\n\ndecline to do so here. The EEOC Guidelines themselves do not set out “practical”\n\nsignificance as an independent requirement, and we find that in a case in which the\n\nstatistical significance of some set of results is clear, there is no need to probe for\n\nadditional “practical” significance. Statistical significance is relevant because it allows a\n\nfact-finder to be confident that the relationship between some rule or policy and some set\n\nof disparate impact results was not the product of chance. This goes to the plaintiff’s\n\nburden of introducing statistical evidence that is “sufficiently substantial” to raise “an\n\ninference of causation.” Watson, 487 U.S. at 994-95. There is no additional requirement\n\nthat the disparate impact caused be above some threshold level of practical significance.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court erred in ruling “in the alternative” that the absence of\n\npractical significance was fatal to Plaintiffs’ case.\n\n       There is no question that Dr. Killingsworth’s results, if the product of a relevant\n\nand otherwise compelling statistical analysis, are statistically significant above the\n\nthreshold that courts have required.10 As noted above, when Dr. Killingsworth analyzed\n\nthe data using a corrected probit analysis, the results yielded a standard deviation of\n\n\n\n\n       10\n        Even Amtrak concedes that the results, if they stand, meet the threshold\nrequirement for statistical significance. Oral Arg. Tr., 47-48.\n\n                                              25\n\f3.855, with a p-value of less than 0.001—meaning the results are incredibly unlikely to\n\nhave occurred as a result of chance alone. The Supreme Court has suggested that a\n\nstandard deviation between 2 and 3 would be sufficient, and Dr. Killingsworth’s results\n\nare considerably above that. See, e.g., Castaneda, 430 U.S. at 496 n.17.\n\n       Thus, the only issue is whether the District Court was correct in finding that Dr.\n\nKillingsworth’s statistical analysis was, in effect, legally irrelevant to satisfying Plaintiffs’\n\nburden with respect to their prima facie case because his analysis used aggregation, and in\n\nparticular the Aggregated Pool, in conducting his statistical analysis. We find that Dr.\n\nKillingsworth’s decision to aggregate the data, although not obviously correct, is also not\n\nobviously incorrect, and so there remains a genuine issue of material fact—whether the\n\none-year rule caused a disparate impact on Amtrak’s female employees.\n\n        The one-year rule applies to all union employees. However, including all union\n\nemployees in the statistical sample would have been inappropriate, since many of them\n\nmay not have been even remote candidates for any management position. To identify all\n\nthose union employees who might reasonably be thought to be candidates for a\n\nmanagement position, Dr. Killingsworth identified those candidates who obtained a\n\nmanagement position during the relevant five-year span, and then identified the previous\n\nunion positions held by those candidates. At that point, Dr. Killingsworth assumed, and\n\nthe District Court found this assumption reasonable, that all those individuals who were in\n\nthe same union position as the position that the successful candidate had previously\n\n\n\n                                               26\n\foccupied might reasonably be thought to have been a possible candidate for the\n\nmanagement position that the successful candidate actually obtained. Thus, if Smith was\n\nhired into Management Position One, and Smith had previously been in Union Position\n\nOne, Dr. Killingsworth assumed that all other individuals—Jones, Williams, Johnson,\n\netc.—who had been in Union Position One were possible candidates for Management\n\nPosition One. This is not a perfect proxy, as all parties concede. For example, Smith\n\nmight have had much more experience than Jones and Williams, or he might have\n\neducational degrees that they lack. But, given that the one-year rule operates as an initial\n\nbar from even becoming a candidate for a job, the only way to measure its effect is to\n\ndevise some way of identifying those who might reasonably be thought to have been\n\npossible candidates were it not for the existence of the one-year rule. We agree with the\n\nDistrict Court that Dr. Killingsworth’s method here was reasonable.\n\n       It is true that while “the population selected for statistical analysis need not\n\nperfectly match the pool of qualified persons,” without “a close fit between the population\n\nused to measure disparate impact and the population of those qualified for a benefit, the\n\nstatistical results cannot be persuasive.” Carpenter v. Boeing Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795238\"><a href=\"/opinion/795238/karla-carpenter-linda-wilkerson-sheryl-landon-sandy-wilcynski-sonya/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1183</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1196\n\n(10th Cir. 2006). One must have the proper pool of people in view before performing\n\nstatistical analysis, or that analysis will be irrelevant. This, however, goes to the issue of\n\nwhether Dr. Killingsworth’s use of the individual Feeder Pools was reasonable or not. In\n\ndiscussing this issue, the District Court stated:\n\n\n\n                                              27\n\f              In the absence of explicit measures of qualifications and job\n              interest, Dr. Killingsworth assumed that information about the\n              position held prior to promotion could reasonably serve as an\n              indicator of qualifications and job interest. Based on the\n              information provided to Dr. Killingsworth by Amtrak,\n              plaintiffs’ method is a reasonable one.\n\nStagi II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2461892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6. We agree.\n\n       Where the District Court identified a problem was with the combining of the\n\nindividual Feeder Pools into one Aggregated Pool. The District Court stated that because\n\nDr. Killingsworth takes the “distinctions between job categories [to be] important” in\n\ncreating the individual Feeder Pools, “then the defendant’s argument that these\n\ndistinctions should be maintained throughout the analysis rings true.” Id. at *9. Amtrak’s\n\ncounsel made this same point repeatedly at oral argument, stating that “if you’re going to\n\nlive in a stratified world, you have to follow that stratified world through to your analysis”\n\nand that “the problem is that we’re aggregating after we stratify, that’s the heart of the\n\nmatter.” Oral Arg. Tr., at 41, 45.\n\n       However, neither the District Court nor Amtrak’s counsel has offered a convincing\n\nexplanation of why the use of aggregated data in this case is improper. The District Court\n\nreintroduces the “qualifications” issue, asserting that “[t]he single aggregated statistic Dr.\n\nKillingsworth relies on compares individuals who may never actually be in competition\n\nfor the same jobs, and does not accurately account for what job the employee in question\n\nis coming from, where they are looking to go, and what the relevant qualifications are.”\n\nStagi II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2461892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. But this criticism misses its target. Creating the\n\n                                              28\n\fAggregated Pool out of the individual Feeder Pools does not erroneously imply that a\n\nperson from Feeder Pool A (created based on Management Position A) is a possible\n\ncandidate, along with the members of Feeder Pool B, for Management Position B.\n\nRather, it just puts together all of those people (or candidacies, more precisely) who are in\n\nunion positions currently, and who are reasonably thought of as possible candidates for\n\nsome management position or other. All of these people are susceptible to the one-year\n\nrule, and thus all of them are potentially “blocked” by its uniform application if they have\n\nserved less than one year in their respective union positions. Aggregating the individual\n\nFeeder Pools in this way appears to be no more problematic, at least with respect to the\n\nissue of qualifications, than doing what Dr. Griffin did when he simply “added up” the\n\ndifference between the expected ineligibility rate and the actual ineligibility rate for each\n\nof the 600 plus individual Feeder Pools.\n\n       At various points, Amtrak’s counsel at oral argument appeared to be arguing that,\n\nas a matter of consistency, once one has subdivided the pool into categories, one ought\n\nnot to recombine those categories into an aggregate pool. The District Court appeared to\n\naccept a similar line of thought when it noted that because Dr. Killingsworth took the\n\n“distinctions between job categories [to be] important” in creating the individual Feeder\n\nPools, “then the defendant’s argument that these distinctions should be maintained\n\nthroughout the analysis rings true.” Id. at *9. But there has been no argument made that\n\nsomehow the statistical analysis is corrupted if one “changes horses” from a stratified to\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\fan aggregated analysis midstream. Indeed, Amtrak’s counsel explicitly stated that “the\n\nactual manner in which [Dr. Killingsworth] performs the numbers is not incorrect, it’s the\n\nunderlying numbers that are the problem.” Oral Arg. Tr., at 44. Finally, Plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel stresses that they never were doing a “stratification” analysis in the first place, but\n\nthat they were simply attempting to “define what is the subset of total union employees\n\nwho seemed to be in positions that made them eligible to seek promotion.” Id. at 56.\n\n       A final possible reason to object to the use of aggregated data is presented by the\n\nDistrict Court when it notes that Dr. Griffin’s report suggests that there are some Feeder\n\nPools in which fewer women than men were made ineligible by the one-year rule, and\n\nsome in which the reverse was true, and that the overall result of women doing worse\n\nthan men (at least under Dr. Killingsworth’s model) obscures these facts. This would be\n\na reason against aggregating insofar as aggregating produces a misleading picture of the\n\noverall situation for women. (As one court has noted, “[i]f Microsoft-founder Bill Gates\n\nand nine monks are together in a room, it is accurate to say that on average the people in\n\nthe room are extremely well-to-do, but this kind of aggregate analysis obscures the fact\n\nthat ninety percent of the people in the room have taken a vow of poverty.” Abram v.\n\nUnited Parcel Serv.

Wis. 2001).) For example, it might\n\nbe that in 400 of the 716 Feeder Pools, women are made ineligible at a rate significantly\n\ngreater than that of men, and that in 316 of the Feeder Pools, the reverse is true. In such a\n\nsituation, the one-year rule appears to have a disparate impact on women only in a subset\n\n\n\n                                              30\n\fof the 716 Feeder Pools.\n\n       Plaintiffs’ second expert, Ramona Paetzold, submitted an affidavit arguing that\n\nstratification is inappropriate in this case precisely because of this possibility. In\n\nparticular, stratification is inappropriate because the numbers of women in each feeder\n\njob at any given point in time is determined, in part, by the existence of the one-year rule\n\nitself, “because the one-year rule at least partially affects how long men and women must\n\nremain in the feeder job before being eligible for promotion.” Paetzold Aff. 3. The\n\nDistrict Court contends that this is a problem for Plaintiffs, because “the gender\n\ncomposition of feeder jobs may very well be affected by additional factors such as wage\n\nlevels, working conditions, movement prospects, layoffs, and the union’s collectible\n\nbargaining agreement that allows unrestricted lateral job movements among union\n\nemployees, none of which the plaintiffs have made any attempt to identify or control for\n\nin their analysis.” Stagi II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2461892</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10. But this seems to be a problem\n\nonly if the reasons against aggregation are compelling. There is no legal requirement to\n\nuse the smallest possible unit of analysis. If there are additional factors (such as seniority\n\nrules)—apart from just the one-year rule—that are determining the composition of the\n\nindividual Feeder Pools in a “gendered” way, these factors may aid Amtrak in mounting a\n\nbusiness justification defense, but it is inappropriate to require Plaintiffs to control for\n\nevery possible such factor in order to sustain their burden of proving a prima facie case.\n\nIf the aggregated data yields a statistically significant finding, such as the one here, that\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\fthe one-year rule is having a disparate impact on women, and there is no compelling\n\nreason to avoid use of aggregated data, that is enough for Plaintiffs to establish their\n\nprima facie case.\n\n       Additionally, there may be good reasons to aggregate data in a case such as\n\nthis—reasons that have nothing to do with simply picking and choosing the model which\n\nwill generate the most favorable results for plaintiffs’ case. Perhaps most significantly, as\n\nthe Fourth Circuit has observed, “by increasing the absolute numbers in the data, chance\n\nwill more readily be excluded as a cause of any disparities found.” Lilly v. Harris-Teeter\n\nSupermarket, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426387\"><a href=\"/opinion/426387/33-fair-emplpraccas-195-32-empl-prac-dec-p-33856-paul-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 336 n.17 (4th Cir. 1983). This makes intuitive sense. “For\n\nexample, if a coin were tossed ten times . . . and came up heads four times, no one would\n\nthink the coin was biased (0.632 standard deviations), but if this same ratio occurred for a\n\ntotal of 10,000 tosses, of which 4,000 were heads, the result could not be attributed to\n\nchance (20 standard deviations).” Id. Here, by combining all of those candidacies in the\n\n716 Feeder Pools into one Aggregated Pool, Dr. Killingsworth was better able to test\n\nwhether the difference in the ineligibility rate for men and women was merely the product\n\nof chance. Many courts have found such a reason for aggregating compelling. See, e.g.,\n\nEldredge v. Carpenters 46 N.

It is possible that there\n\nare reasons to prefer Dr. Griffin’s methodology to Dr. Killingsworth’s methodology,\n\ngiven that they yield conflicting conclusions regarding whether the one-year rule has an\n\nall-things-considered disparate impact on women. But we cannot so conclude on this\n\nrecord, and the reasons presented by the District Court for finding that Plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to make out a prima facie case do not withstand scrutiny. Accordingly, we find that\n\nthe District Court should not have granted Amtrak’s motion for summary judgment based\n\non this record.\n\n                                             V.\n\n       We will reverse the judgment of the District Court granting Amtrak’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment and will remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\f</pre>",
