GREGOR\n\nALEXANDER, J.\n\n         [¶1] Marianne A. Gregor appeals from a judgment entered in the District\n\nCourt (Belfast, R. Murray, J.) denying Homeward Residential, Inc.’s foreclosure\n\nclaim. Gregor contends that the court erred by (1) stating in its judgment that\n\n“[t]he parties may relitigate issues discussed herein in a future action,”\n\n(2) admitting in evidence a witness’s description of a computer printout to support\n\na finding of the amount due on the loan, and (3) finding that Homeward\n\nResidential was in possession of the promissory note. We vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for an entry of a dismissal without prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n   1\n      Before trial in this matter, Homeward Residential, Inc.’s interest in the mortgage was apparently\nassumed by Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, as discussed later in this opinion. There has been no motion\nfor substitution of party, and for clarity of case references, the name of the case is not changed, though the\nrulings in this opinion shall bind Ocwen equally.\n\f2\n\n                                     I. CASE HISTORY\n\n         [¶2] Viewing the findings and evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\ncourt’s judgment, the case history is derived from the judgment and trial record.\n\nSee Botka v. S.C. Noyes & Co., Inc., 2003 ME 128, ¶ 15, 834 A.2d 947. The\n\nhistory of the transaction is confusing because of the many assignments and\n\ntransfers of interest and differing uses of terminology, not always well\n\ndocumented, that the various financial services providers elected to engage in\n\nsubsequent to the original, and apparently standard, promissory note and mortgage\n\ntransaction.\n\n         [¶3] In this opinion, we use the term “promissory note” to refer to the\n\ndocument by which the homeowner promises to pay the debt owed, although some\n\nsources call this document the “mortgage note.” We use the term “mortgage” to\n\nrefer to the document memorializing the agreement that certain real property will\n\nsecure the debt referenced in the promissory note, although some sources call this\n\ndocument the “mortgage agreement” or “mortgage deed.”\n\nA.       The Original Transaction and Subsequent Assignments\n\n         [¶4] On May 31, 2002, Marianne A. Gregor and George J. Wulff2 executed\n\na promissory note in the amount of $80,000 to SUN MORTGAGE – New England,\n\n     2\n      George Wulff was named as Marianne Gregor’s co-defendant in the underlying complaint for\nforeclosure. Although Wulff communicated to the court a request for mediation, he did not otherwise\nappear in or defend the action. Wulff’s name remains on the promissory note and he has not been\n\f                                                                                                        3\n\nInc.3 On the same day, Gregor signed a mortgage on property in Knox securing\n\nthe debt. The mortgage listed Sun Mortgage as the “Lender,” and by it Gregor\n\n“mortgage[d], grant[ed] and convey[ed] the [Knox property] to Lender.”4 The\n\nmortgage was recorded in the Waldo County Registry of Deeds.\n\n          [¶5] The record reflects that the mortgage was assigned or transferred at\n\nleast eight times subsequent to its creation. Only five assignments or transfers of\n\nthe mortgage were recorded in the Registry of Deeds. The eight assignments or\n\ntransfers indicated in the available record were as follows:\n\n          n           On May 31, 2002, the same day that Gregor signed the mortgage,\n\n                       Sun Mortgage assigned its interest in the mortgage to RBMG, Inc.\n\n                       This assignment was recorded in the Registry.\n\n          n           On June 4, 2002, RBMG assigned “all its rights, title, and interest”\n\n                       in the mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association\n\n\n\n\ndismissed from the litigation, but any reference to “Gregor” is to Gregor only, because Wulff has not\nappealed from the judgment or participated in the appeal. See Bank of Am., N.A. v. Greenleaf,\n2014 ME 89, ¶ 2 n.2, 96 A.3d 700.\n   3\n       Each entity’s name is written as it appears in the trial record.\n   4\n       As part of the transaction, and in terms common to promissory note and mortgage transactions,\nGregor agreed to pay reasonable attorney fees should there be any default on the note. If a proper\nplaintiff demonstrating standing to enforce the note and the mortgage appears, the trial court may have to\ndetermine whether reasonable attorney fees may include the fees and costs incident to tracking and\nsorting out the numerous assignments and transfers of the note and mortgage subsequent to the original,\nsingle loan transaction for which Gregor undertook to pay attorney fees upon default.\n\f4\n\n                    (“Fannie Mae”).          This assignment was not recorded in the\n\n                    Registry.\n\n        n          On an unknown date, whatever remaining interest RBMG had in\n\n                    the mortgage, if any, was assumed by NetBank, purporting to be\n\n                    RBMG’s successor in interest, perhaps after a takeover of RBMG.\n\n                    At the trial, Homeward Residential presented no documentation\n\n                    regarding the assumption of RBMG’s interest by NetBank. There\n\n                    is no indication that this assumption of interest was recorded in the\n\n                    Registry.\n\n        n          On an unknown date,5 NetBank, purporting to be RBMG’s\n\n                    successor in interest, assigned the mortgage—or whatever\n\n                    remainder interest RBMG had in the mortgage—to Mortgage\n\n                    Electronic     Registration       Systems,      Inc.    (“MERS”).6           This\n\n                    assignment was recorded in the Registry. This was the fourth\n\n                    assignment or transfer of an interest in the mortgage, and the last\n\n                    assignment before default.\n\n    5\n      The court found that the date was unknown, and the trial exhibit bears no date. However, the\nforeclosure complaint attached the series of recorded assignments, and the copy of the assignment to\nMERS shows at the bottom of the page (cut off in the trial exhibit) that the Waldo County Registry of\nDeeds received the assignment to MERS on November 13, 2006.\n    6\n     At trial, Homeward Residential failed to offer any evidence that NetBank had any legal interest in\nthe mortgage to assign to MERS, aside from the mortgage assignment itself, upon which was stamped\n“NetBank AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO RBMG, INC.”\n\f                                                                                     5\n\n      n        On September 1, 2010, MERS assigned the mortgage to IXIS Real\n\n                Estate Capital Inc. This assignment was recorded in the Registry.\n\n      n        On August 1, 2011, IXIS assigned the mortgage to Bank of\n\n                America, N.A. This assignment was recorded in the Registry.\n\n      n        On October 23, 2012, Bank of America assigned the mortgage to\n\n                Homeward Residential, Inc. This assignment was recorded in the\n\n                Registry.\n\n      n        On an unknown date before the trial in this action, Homeward\n\n                Residential and its interest in the mortgage were taken over by or\n\n                merged into Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC. There is no indication\n\n                in the record that this transfer of ownership and interest was\n\n                recorded in the Registry.\n\n      [¶6] Each of the five assignments recorded in the Waldo County Registry of\n\nDeeds states that the assignor is assigning all of its interest in the mortgage to the\n\nassignee. The nature of those interests, after the unrecorded assignment of the\n\nmortgage to Fannie Mae, is unclear.         Fannie Mae has not appeared in this\n\nproceeding, and the record does not include any documentation from Fannie Mae\n\nauthorizing any other entity to appear on its behalf as its agent, loan servicer, or in\n\nany other capacity.\n\f6\n\nB.       The Default and Subsequent Court Action\n\n         [¶7] Gregor stopped making payments on the mortgage in June 2009. On\n\nNovember 10, 2010, IXIS sent Gregor a notice of default and right to cure. When\n\nGregor had not cured the default by October 17, 2011, Bank of America,\n\npurportedly having been assigned the mortgage by IXIS, filed a complaint for\n\nforeclosure. Homeward Residential was later substituted as plaintiff, consistent\n\nwith the last recorded mortgage assignment.\n\n         [¶8] In August 2013, after the discovery deadline, Gregor moved for leave\n\nto serve requests for admissions upon Homeward Residential. Gregor argued that,\n\nduring discovery, Homeward Residential produced the Fannie Mae mortgage\n\nassignment, which Gregor asserted called into question Homeward Residential’s\n\nownership of the mortgage and standing to conduct this foreclosure action. Gregor\n\nsought admissions that Fannie Mae is the owner of the promissory note and\n\nmortgage and that Homeward Residential sent a copy of the Fannie Mae mortgage\n\nassignment to Gregor during discovery. The court (Worth, J.) granted the motion.\n\nIn a document dated November 1, 2013, Homeward7 Residential responded to the\n\nrequest for admissions by stating that Fannie Mae “is the owner of the loan\n\nevidenced by the note . . . and the mortgage . . . that are the subject of this lawsuit”;\n\n     7\n      Counsel responding to the request for admissions actually referred to his client as “Homewood\nResidential, Inc.,” but this appears to be a typographical error, as the October 23, 2012, assignment from\nBank of America is clearly to “Homeward Residential, Inc.”\n\f                                                                                                          7\n\nthat Homeward Residential “is not the owner of the loan that is the subject of this\n\nlawsuit”; and that Homeward Residential sent a copy of the Fannie Mae mortgage\n\nassignment to Gregor during discovery.\n\n        [¶9] On February 11, 2014, the court (R. Murray, J.) held a bench trial. The\n\nsole witness at trial was a loan analyst from Ocwen, which, she testified, is the\n\ncurrent servicer of the mortgage. The loan analyst testified that “Ocwen was first a\n\nservicer for Homeward [Residential] and then there was a merger between the\n\ntwo,” and “Ocwen kind of consumed Homeward [Residential].”                                  The precise\n\nnature of the relationship between Ocwen and Homeward Residential remained\n\nunclear throughout the hearing.                At times, the loan analyst and Homeward\n\nResidential’s counsel identified both Ocwen and Homeward Residential as being\n\n“the plaintiff” in the action.\n\n        [¶10] At trial, the court admitted in evidence, among other exhibits, a copy\n\nof the original promissory note;8 a copy of the original mortgage; the series of\n\nrecorded mortgage assignments; the unrecorded mortgage assignment from RBMG\n\nto Fannie Mae; an Ocwen computer printout purporting to show the amount due on\n\nthe loan; and a copy of Homeward Residential’s responses to Gregor’s requests for\n\nadmissions.\n\n\n   8\n      After examining the original of the promissory note, the court permitted plaintiff’s counsel to retain\nthe original and provide a copy for the court record. The promissory note was indorsed in blank.\n\f8\n\n        [¶11] On August 20, 2014, the court entered judgment for Gregor but, in its\n\norder, made factual findings, including a finding that Gregor owes a total of\n\n$119,302.51 on the note. The court also found that Homeward Residential was\n\nentitled to enforce the promissory note because its counsel possessed the original\n\nnote at trial and the note was indorsed in blank. The court determined, however,\n\nthat Homeward Residential had not established that it had standing to foreclose on\n\nthe mortgage, citing Bank of America, N.A. v. Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89,\n\n96 A.3d 700, due to the prior assignment of the mortgage to Fannie Mae.\n\n        [¶12] In its judgment, the court stated that it was “reserving the right for\n\nboth parties to relitigate the issues discussed herein so that this action does not act\n\nas a bar to future action.”             The entry of the judgment read: “Judgment for\n\nDefendant. The parties may relitigate issues discussed herein in a future action.”\n\nGregor brought this timely appeal. See 14 M.R.S. § 1901 (2014); M.R. App. P. 2.\n\n                                     II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n        [¶13]     “We’ve lost our way in these foreclosure cases.”                          Homeward\n\nResidential’s counsel expressed this opinion at oral argument. Indeed, the way has\n\nbeen lost, but not through fault of the courts. The financial services industry,\n\nthrough the practice of securitization,9 spawning a byzantine mass of assignments,\n\n\n    9\n     Although there are variations in securitization practice, “there is still a core standard transaction”\nwhen securitization takes place:\n\f                                                                                                         9\n\ntransfers, and documentation, has made it difficult for subsequent assignees to\n\ndemonstrate that they have standing to bring foreclosure claims and prove the\n\nelements necessary to prevail in a foreclosure action in a manner compliant with\n\nthe laws governing foreclosure, see 14 M.R.S. §§ 6321-6325 (2013).10 In this\n\nprocess, some entities in the chain of assignments disappear, or their records are\n\nlost, making it difficult or impossible to acquire necessary records that qualify for\n\nadmission under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, M.R.\n\nEvid. 803(6), in order to prove ownership of the mortgage, proper notice of\n\ndefaults, and sums due and paid.\n\n\n        First, a financial institution (the “sponsor” or “seller”) assembles a pool of mortgage\n        loans either made (“originated”) by an affiliate of the financial institution or purchased\n        from unaffiliated third-party originators. Second, the pool of loans is sold by the sponsor\n        to a special-purpose subsidiary (the “depositor”) that has no other assets or liabilities and\n        is little more than a legal entity with a mailbox. This is done to segregate the loans from\n        the sponsor’s assets and liabilities. Third, the depositor sells the loans to a passive,\n        specially created, single-purpose vehicle (SPV), typically a trust in the case of\n        residential-mortgage securitization. The trustee will then typically convey the mortgage\n        notes and security instruments to a document custodian for safekeeping. The SPV issues\n        certificated debt securities to raise the funds to pay for the loans. As these debt securities\n        are backed by the cash flow from the mortgages, they are called mortgage-backed\n        securities (MBS).\n\nAdam J. Levitin, The Paper Chase: Securitization, Foreclosure, and the Uncertainty of Mortgage Title,\n63 Duke L.J. 637, 671-72 (2013) (footnotes omitted).\n   10\n        The foreclosure statutes have since been amended and a new section has been added. See, e.g.,\nP.L. 2013, ch. 521, § B-1 (effective Aug. 1, 2014) (enacting section 6326) (codified at 14 M.R.S. § 6326\n(2014)). One such amendment (effective October 15, 2015) amends section 6321 to require that, “[i]n\norder to state a claim for foreclosure upon which relief can be granted, the complaint must contain a\ncertification of proof of ownership of the mortgage note.” P.L. 2015, ch. 229, § 1. The stated purpose of\nthe amendment is to require the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to identify the owner of the promissory\nnote at the outset of the litigation “when the parties most need that information as they engage in\nmediation and loan modification efforts.” Summary, Comm. Amend. A to L.D. 401, No. H-257 (127th\nLegis. 2015). The additional language will provide a defendant with relief pursuant to M.R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) if a complaint does not certify such proof.\n\f10\n\n          [¶14] The law, the rules of evidence, and court processes have not become\n\nmore complicated in these matters.                   Applying established law, however, has\n\nbecome more problematic as courts address the problems the financial services\n\nindustry has created for itself.11 See, e.g., Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, ¶¶ 8-17, 24-27,\n\n96 A.3d 700. We address those problems again today.\n\n     11\n        Among those problems is the difficulty of establishing that records and documents are reliable\nenough to be admitted in evidence and to be used by a court as a basis for judgment. We discussed this\nissue in Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, 96 A.3d 700, but pause again here to note that, even if Homeward\nResidential/Ocwen had been able to establish its standing, the evidence it presented to support its claim\nwas wholly inadequate.\n\n        The well-recognized business records exception to the hearsay rule, M.R. Evid. 803(6), governs\n“[t]he admissibility of a business record . . . [and] dictates both (1) what foundation must be laid to admit\nsuch evidence . . . and (2) the type of witness required to lay that foundation.” Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89,\n¶ 25, 96 A.3d 700 (discussing M.R. Evid. 803(6) (Tower 2014), which was in effect prior to the Maine\nRules of Evidence’s restyling in 2015). The foundation must be laid by a witness who is a “custodian or\nanother qualified witness.” M.R. Evid. 803(6); Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, ¶ 25, 96 A.3d 700. “A qualified\nwitness is one who was intimately involved in the daily operation of the business and whose testimony\nshowed the firsthand nature of his or her knowledge.” Bank of Me. v. Hatch, 2012 ME 35, ¶ 7,\n38 A.3d 1260 (alteration omitted); see also Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, ¶ 25, 96 A.3d 700. In making\nfoundational findings, the court may only consider evidence established prior to the exhibit’s admission in\nevidence. Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, ¶ 26 n.15, 96 A.3d 700.\n\n       The loan analyst that Homeward Residential/Ocwen offered was simply not qualified to lay the\nfoundation necessary to admit the printout. Her testimony did not establish that she had any firsthand\nknowledge of Ocwen’s practices that led to the creation of the document, let alone that she was\n“intimately involved in the daily operation of the business.” Hatch, 2012 ME 35, ¶ 7, 38 A.3d 1260.\n\n         The loan analyst testified that her job at Ocwen is to “review business records on defaulted loans\n. . . in preparation for legal proceedings.” She testified that her knowledge of both Ocwen’s auditing\nprocedures, which verify the accuracy of the prior servicers’ records, and Ocwen’s daily operations,\nwhich include collecting payments and making entries in the computer system regarding payments and\ndebts, came secondhand through her training, not from observation or participation in making the entries.\nFor example, when asked what was the basis of her knowledge of Ocwen’s procedures for incorporating\nin its records the records of the loan’s prior servicers, the loan analyst testified: “We have to know how\nprior servicer records become a part of our records. So I was actually told that information. I don’t\nremember it step by step, it’s a very detailed process, but the gist of it, yes.”\n\n        The record is devoid of evidence to support a finding that the loan analyst was a witness qualified\nto lay the foundation for the computer printout’s admission.\n\f                                                                                 11\n\nA.    Jurisdiction, Justiciability, and Standing\n\n      [¶15] At oral argument, Gregor stated that there has been a lack of clarity on\n\nthe issue of whether a party’s standing affects a court’s jurisdiction. We do not\n\nagree, but will begin by addressing this issue.\n\n      [¶16] Standing is properly labeled an issue of “justiciability.” Madore v.\n\nMe. Land Use Regulation Comm’n, 1998 ME 178, ¶ 8, 715 A.2d 157.\n\n“Justiciability requires a real and substantial controversy, admitting of specific\n\nrelief through a judgment of conclusive character.” Witham Family Ltd. P’ship v.\n\nTown of Bar Harbor, 2015 ME 12, ¶ 7, 110 A.3d 642. “Courts can only decide\n\ncases before them that involve justiciable controversies.” Id. (quoting Lewiston\n\nDaily Sun v. Sch. Admin. Dist. No. 43, 1999 ME 143, ¶ 12, 738 A.2d 1239).\n\n      [¶17]    We have recognized before that the words “jurisdiction” and\n\n“jurisdictional” are understood to have “‘many, too many, meanings,’” and that\n\n“[c]ourts ‘have been less than meticulous’ in using the term[s].” Landmark Realty\n\nv. Leasure, 2004 ME 85, ¶ 7, 853 A.2d 749 (quoting Kontrick v. Ryan,\n\n540 U.S. 443, 454 (2004)). The word “jurisdiction” most properly encapsulates\n\nonly “‘prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction)\n\nand the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court’s adjudicatory\n\nauthority.’” Id. (quoting Kontrick, 540 U.S. at 455).\n\f12\n\n      [¶18] We have stated before that standing issues are “jurisdictional,” see,\n\ne.g., Stull v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 2000 ME 21, ¶ 11, 745 A.2d 975, but that\n\nobservation is shorthand for the statement that standing affects a party’s capacity to\n\ninvoke a court’s jurisdiction, see Brink’s, Inc. v. Me. Armored Car & Courier\n\nServ., Inc., 423 A.2d 536, 537 (Me. 1980). We have made a similar observation in\n\nother foreclosure cases.    See, e.g., Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, ¶ 9, 96 A.3d 700\n\n(“Without possession of or any interest in the note, [a party] lack[s] standing to\n\ninstitute foreclosure proceedings and [may] not invoke the jurisdiction of our trial\n\ncourts.” (quoting Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Saunders, 2010 ME 79,\n\n¶ 15, 2 A.3d 289)).\n\n      [¶19] Standing does not affect the court’s subject-matter jurisdiction over\n\nforeclosures; 14 M.R.S. § 6321 grants subject-matter jurisdiction of all foreclosure\n\ncases to our trial courts. A party may not invoke that jurisdiction without standing,\n\nhowever, which is also required by section 6321.                 Cf. Brink’s, Inc.,\n\n423 A.2d at 537 (noting that the first sentence of a now repealed and replaced\n\nstatute granted subject-matter jurisdiction to this Court to hear appeals of Public\n\nUtilities Commission decisions and that the second sentence “define[d] the class of\n\npersons [that] ha[d] standing to invoke [that] jurisdiction”).\n\n      [¶20] Just as a court may notice and act on issues of jurisdiction at any time,\n\nso may a court notice and act on issues relating to its authority at any time, on its\n\f                                                                                  13\n\nown motion or on the motion of a party. Francis v. Dana-Cummings, 2007 ME 16,\n\n¶ 20, 915 A.2d 412; see also Nemon v. Summit Floors, Inc., 520 A.2d 1310, 1312\n\n(Me. 1987) (“We will entertain a question of standing at any time.”).\n\n      [¶21] Here,     the    court    properly    determined      that   Homeward\n\nResidential/Ocwen lacked standing to bring the foreclosure action pursuant to\n\nsection 6321. The plaintiff in a foreclosure action must demonstrate that it is the\n\nholder of the promissory note and the owner of the mortgage, or that it is claiming\n\nunder the holder and owner. Greenleaf, 2014 ME 89, ¶¶ 9, 10, 12, 96 A.3d 700.\n\nHomeward Residential/Ocwen admitted that it does not own the mortgage, and did\n\nnot offer evidence that it was claiming under the owner of the mortgage.\n\nHomeward Residential/Ocwen conceded in its responses to Gregor’s requests for\n\nadmissions that Fannie Mae owns the mortgage.\n\n       [¶22] The court also did not clearly err in finding that, because Homeward\n\nResidential/Ocwen had a copy of the Fannie Mae assignment in its file for the\n\nmortgage, it was more likely than not that each entity assigned the mortgage after it\n\nwas assigned to Fannie Mae had actual knowledge of the unrecorded assignment.\n\nSee 33 M.R.S. § 201 (2014); Spickler v. Ginn, 2012 ME 46, ¶ 10, 18, 40 A.3d 999\n\n(interpreting 33 M.R.S. § 201 to provide that when a party chooses not to record a\n\ndeed, that deed trumps the interest in the same property of the grantor, the\n\ngrantor’s heirs and devisees, and any person having “actual notice” of the\n\f14\n\nunrecorded conveyance, even if the later person records her deed, as long as she\n\nhad actual notice of the unrecorded deed at the time she recorded the deed). Any\n\nplaintiff claiming to have an interest in the mortgage superior to that of Fannie\n\nMae would have been required to join Fannie Mae as a necessary party. See M.R.\n\nCiv. P. 19. No effort at joinder was initiated here.\n\n      [¶23] Finally, Ocwen’s witness’s testimony called into question whether\n\nHomeward Residential continued to exist. Therefore, the record wholly supports\n\nthe court’s determination that Homeward Residential/Ocwen failed to demonstrate\n\nthat either had standing to maintain the foreclosure action.\n\n      [¶24]    Although the court maintained jurisdiction over the parties and\n\nsubject matter, it could not decide the merits of the case when the plaintiff lacked\n\nstanding pursuant to section 6321. See Witham Family Ltd. P’ship, 2015 ME 12,\n\n¶ 7, 110 A.3d 642 (“Courts can only decide cases before them that involve\n\njusticiable controversies.”).   Instead, the court could only dismiss the action.\n\nBecause the court addressed the merits of the complaint for foreclosure in its\n\njudgment, we vacate the judgment in its entirety and remand for an entry of a\n\ndismissal without prejudice.\n\nB.    Other Issues on Appeal\n\n      [¶25] Because the case is being dismissed without prejudice, with the entire\n\njudgment being vacated, we reject Gregor’s claim that the statement in the\n\f                                                                                  15\n\njudgment that the parties may relitigate the issues in a future action opens the door\n\nto future litigation that would otherwise be closed. In any future litigation against\n\nGregor regarding this mortgage, the plaintiff—whoever that may be—will have to\n\nestablish both the amount due and Gregor’s responsibility for paying that amount.\n\n       [¶26] The court correctly determined that Homeward Residential/Ocwen\n\nlacked standing to pursue the foreclosure claim. However, the court erred when it\n\nmade findings and entered judgment for Gregor rather than dismissing the action\n\nfor lack of standing. Therefore, we vacate the judgment in its entirety—including\n\nthe court’s statement to the effect that the parties may relitigate the issues in a\n\nfuture action—and remand for an entry of a dismissal without prejudice.\n\n      The entry is:\n\n                      Judgment vacated. Remanded for an entry of a\n                      dismissal without prejudice.\n\n\n\nOn the briefs:\n\n      Thomas A. Cox, Esq., Portland, for appellant Marianne A.\n      Gregor\n\n      David W.

Gregor contends that the court erred by (1) stating in its judgment that\n\n“[t]he parties may relitigate issues discussed herein in a future action,”\n\n(2) admitting in evidence a witness’s description of a computer printout to support\n\na finding of the amount due on the loan, and (3) finding that Homeward\n\nResidential was in possession of the promissory note. We vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for an entry of a dismissal without prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n   1\n      Before trial in this matter, Homeward Residential, Inc.’s interest in the mortgage was apparently\nassumed by Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, as discussed later in this opinion.

The\n\nhistory of the transaction is confusing because of the many assignments and\n\ntransfers of interest and differing uses of terminology, not always well\n\ndocumented, that the various financial services providers elected to engage in\n\nsubsequent to the original, and apparently standard, promissory note and mortgage\n\ntransaction.\n\n         [¶3] In this opinion, we use the term “promissory note” to refer to the\n\ndocument by which the homeowner promises to pay the debt owed, although some\n\nsources call this document the “mortgage note.” We use the term “mortgage” to\n\nrefer to the document memorializing the agreement that certain real property will\n\nsecure the debt referenced in the promissory note, although some sources call this\n\ndocument the “mortgage agreement” or “mortgage deed.”\n\nA.       The Original Transaction and Subsequent Assignments\n\n         [¶4] On May 31, 2002, Marianne A. Gregor and George J. Wulff2 executed\n\na promissory note in the amount of $80,000 to SUN MORTGAGE – New England,\n\n     2\n      George Wulff was named as Marianne Gregor’s co-defendant in the underlying complaint for\nforeclosure. Although Wulff communicated to the court a request for mediation, he did not otherwise\nappear in or defend the action. Wulff’s name remains on the promissory note and he has not been\n\f                                                                                                        3\n\nInc.3 On the same day, Gregor signed a mortgage on property in Knox securing\n\nthe debt. The mortgage listed Sun Mortgage as the “Lender,” and by it Gregor\n\n“mortgage[d], grant[ed] and convey[ed] the [Knox property] to Lender.”4 The\n\nmortgage was recorded in the Waldo County Registry of Deeds.\n\n          [¶5] The record reflects that the mortgage was assigned or transferred at\n\nleast eight times subsequent to its creation. Only five assignments or transfers of\n\nthe mortgage were recorded in the Registry of Deeds. The eight assignments or\n\ntransfers indicated in the available record were as follows:\n\n          n           On May 31, 2002, the same day that Gregor signed the mortgage,\n\n                       Sun Mortgage assigned its interest in the mortgage to RBMG, Inc.\n\n                       This assignment was recorded in the Registry.\n\n          n           On June 4, 2002, RBMG assigned “all its rights, title, and interest”\n\n                       in the mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association\n\n\n\n\ndismissed from the litigation, but any reference to “Gregor” is to Gregor only, because Wulff has not\nappealed from the judgment or participated in the appeal.

If a proper\nplaintiff demonstrating standing to enforce the note and the mortgage appears, the trial court may have to\ndetermine whether reasonable attorney fees may include the fees and costs incident to tracking and\nsorting out the numerous assignments and transfers of the note and mortgage subsequent to the original,\nsingle loan transaction for which Gregor undertook to pay attorney fees upon default.\n\f4\n\n                    (“Fannie Mae”).          This assignment was not recorded in the\n\n                    Registry.\n\n        n          On an unknown date, whatever remaining interest RBMG had in\n\n                    the mortgage, if any, was assumed by NetBank, purporting to be\n\n                    RBMG’s successor in interest, perhaps after a takeover of RBMG.\n\n                    At the trial, Homeward Residential presented no documentation\n\n                    regarding the assumption of RBMG’s interest by NetBank. There\n\n                    is no indication that this assumption of interest was recorded in the\n\n                    Registry.\n\n        n          On an unknown date,5 NetBank, purporting to be RBMG’s\n\n                    successor in interest, assigned the mortgage—or whatever\n\n                    remainder interest RBMG had in the mortgage—to Mortgage\n\n                    Electronic     Registration       Systems,      Inc.    (“MERS”).6           This\n\n                    assignment was recorded in the Registry. This was the fourth\n\n                    assignment or transfer of an interest in the mortgage, and the last\n\n                    assignment before default.\n\n    5\n      The court found that the date was unknown, and the trial exhibit bears no date. However, the\nforeclosure complaint attached the series of recorded assignments, and the copy of the assignment to\nMERS shows at the bottom of the page (cut off in the trial exhibit) that the Waldo County Registry of\nDeeds received the assignment to MERS on November 13, 2006.\n    6\n     At trial, Homeward Residential failed to offer any evidence that NetBank had any legal interest in\nthe mortgage to assign to MERS, aside from the mortgage assignment itself, upon which was stamped\n“NetBank AS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST TO RBMG, INC.”\n\f                                                                                     5\n\n      n        On September 1, 2010, MERS assigned the mortgage to IXIS Real\n\n                Estate Capital Inc. This assignment was recorded in the Registry.\n\n      n        On August 1, 2011, IXIS assigned the mortgage to Bank of\n\n                America, N.A. This assignment was recorded in the Registry.\n\n      n        On October 23, 2012, Bank of America assigned the mortgage to\n\n                Homeward Residential, Inc. This assignment was recorded in the\n\n                Registry.\n\n      n        On an unknown date before the trial in this action, Homeward\n\n                Residential and its interest in the mortgage were taken over by or\n\n                merged into Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC. There is no indication\n\n                in the record that this transfer of ownership and interest was\n\n                recorded in the Registry.\n\n      [¶6] Each of the five assignments recorded in the Waldo County Registry of\n\nDeeds states that the assignor is assigning all of its interest in the mortgage to the\n\nassignee. The nature of those interests, after the unrecorded assignment of the\n\nmortgage to Fannie Mae, is unclear.         Fannie Mae has not appeared in this\n\nproceeding, and the record does not include any documentation from Fannie Mae\n\nauthorizing any other entity to appear on its behalf as its agent, loan servicer, or in\n\nany other capacity.\n\f6\n\nB.       The Default and Subsequent Court Action\n\n         [¶7] Gregor stopped making payments on the mortgage in June 2009. On\n\nNovember 10, 2010, IXIS sent Gregor a notice of default and right to cure. When\n\nGregor had not cured the default by October 17, 2011, Bank of America,\n\npurportedly having been assigned the mortgage by IXIS, filed a complaint for\n\nforeclosure. Homeward Residential was later substituted as plaintiff, consistent\n\nwith the last recorded mortgage assignment.\n\n         [¶8] In August 2013, after the discovery deadline, Gregor moved for leave\n\nto serve requests for admissions upon Homeward Residential. Gregor argued that,\n\nduring discovery, Homeward Residential produced the Fannie Mae mortgage\n\nassignment, which Gregor asserted called into question Homeward Residential’s\n\nownership of the mortgage and standing to conduct this foreclosure action. Gregor\n\nsought admissions that Fannie Mae is the owner of the promissory note and\n\nmortgage and that Homeward Residential sent a copy of the Fannie Mae mortgage\n\nassignment to Gregor during discovery. The court (Worth, J.) granted the motion.\n\nIn a document dated November 1, 2013, Homeward7 Residential responded to the\n\nrequest for admissions by stating that Fannie Mae “is the owner of the loan\n\nevidenced by the note . . . and the mortgage . . . that are the subject of this lawsuit”;\n\n     7\n      Counsel responding to the request for admissions actually referred to his client as “Homewood\nResidential, Inc.,” but this appears to be a typographical error, as the October 23, 2012, assignment from\nBank of America is clearly to “Homeward Residential, Inc.”\n\f                                                                                                          7\n\nthat Homeward Residential “is not the owner of the loan that is the subject of this\n\nlawsuit”; and that Homeward Residential sent a copy of the Fannie Mae mortgage\n\nassignment to Gregor during discovery.\n\n        [¶9] On February 11, 2014, the court (R. Murray, J.) held a bench trial. The\n\nsole witness at trial was a loan analyst from Ocwen, which, she testified, is the\n\ncurrent servicer of the mortgage. The loan analyst testified that “Ocwen was first a\n\nservicer for Homeward [Residential] and then there was a merger between the\n\ntwo,” and “Ocwen kind of consumed Homeward [Residential].”                                  The precise\n\nnature of the relationship between Ocwen and Homeward Residential remained\n\nunclear throughout the hearing.                At times, the loan analyst and Homeward\n\nResidential’s counsel identified both Ocwen and Homeward Residential as being\n\n“the plaintiff” in the action.\n\n        [¶10] At trial, the court admitted in evidence, among other exhibits, a copy\n\nof the original promissory note;8 a copy of the original mortgage; the series of\n\nrecorded mortgage assignments; the unrecorded mortgage assignment from RBMG\n\nto Fannie Mae; an Ocwen computer printout purporting to show the amount due on\n\nthe loan; and a copy of Homeward Residential’s responses to Gregor’s requests for\n\nadmissions.\n\n\n   8\n      After examining the original of the promissory note, the court permitted plaintiff’s counsel to retain\nthe original and provide a copy for the court record. The promissory note was indorsed in blank.\n\f8\n\n        [¶11] On August 20, 2014, the court entered judgment for Gregor but, in its\n\norder, made factual findings, including a finding that Gregor owes a total of\n\n$119,302.51 on the note. The court also found that Homeward Residential was\n\nentitled to enforce the promissory note because its counsel possessed the original\n\nnote at trial and the note was indorsed in blank. The court determined, however,\n\nthat Homeward Residential had not established that it had standing to foreclose on\n\nthe mortgage, citing Bank of America, N.A. v. Greenleaf, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, due to the prior assignment of the mortgage to Fannie Mae.\n\n        [¶12] In its judgment, the court stated that it was “reserving the right for\n\nboth parties to relitigate the issues discussed herein so that this action does not act\n\nas a bar to future action.”             The entry of the judgment read: “Judgment for\n\nDefendant. The parties may relitigate issues discussed herein in a future action.”\n\nGregor brought this timely appeal. See 14 M.R.S. § 1901 (2014); M.R. App. P. 2.\n\n                                     II. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n        [¶13]     “We’ve lost our way in these foreclosure cases.”                          Homeward\n\nResidential’s counsel expressed this opinion at oral argument. Indeed, the way has\n\nbeen lost, but not through fault of the courts. The financial services industry,\n\nthrough the practice of securitization,9 spawning a byzantine mass of assignments,\n\n\n    9\n     Although there are variations in securitization practice, “there is still a core standard transaction”\nwhen securitization takes place:\n\f                                                                                                         9\n\ntransfers, and documentation, has made it difficult for subsequent assignees to\n\ndemonstrate that they have standing to bring foreclosure claims and prove the\n\nelements necessary to prevail in a foreclosure action in a manner compliant with\n\nthe laws governing foreclosure, see 14 M.R.S. §§ 6321-6325 (2013).10 In this\n\nprocess, some entities in the chain of assignments disappear, or their records are\n\nlost, making it difficult or impossible to acquire necessary records that qualify for\n\nadmission under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, M.R.\n\nEvid. 803(6), in order to prove ownership of the mortgage, proper notice of\n\ndefaults, and sums due and paid.\n\n\n        First, a financial institution (the “sponsor” or “seller”) assembles a pool of mortgage\n        loans either made (“originated”) by an affiliate of the financial institution or purchased\n        from unaffiliated third-party originators. Second, the pool of loans is sold by the sponsor\n        to a special-purpose subsidiary (the “depositor”) that has no other assets or liabilities and\n        is little more than a legal entity with a mailbox. This is done to segregate the loans from\n        the sponsor’s assets and liabilities. Third, the depositor sells the loans to a passive,\n        specially created, single-purpose vehicle (SPV), typically a trust in the case of\n        residential-mortgage securitization. The trustee will then typically convey the mortgage\n        notes and security instruments to a document custodian for safekeeping. The SPV issues\n        certificated debt securities to raise the funds to pay for the loans. As these debt securities\n        are backed by the cash flow from the mortgages, they are called mortgage-backed\n        securities (MBS).\n\nAdam J. Levitin, The Paper Chase: Securitization, Foreclosure, and the Uncertainty of Mortgage Title,\n63 Duke L.J. 637, 671-72 (2013) (footnotes omitted).\n   10\n        The foreclosure statutes have since been amended and a new section has been added. See, e.g.,\nP.L. 2013, ch. 521, § B-1 (effective Aug. 1, 2014) (enacting section 6326) (codified at 14 M.R.S. § 6326\n(2014)). One such amendment (effective October 15, 2015) amends section 6321 to require that, “[i]n\norder to state a claim for foreclosure upon which relief can be granted, the complaint must contain a\ncertification of proof of ownership of the mortgage note.” P.L. 2015, ch. 229, § 1. The stated purpose of\nthe amendment is to require the plaintiff in a foreclosure action to identify the owner of the promissory\nnote at the outset of the litigation “when the parties most need that information as they engage in\nmediation and loan modification efforts.” Summary, Comm. Amend. A to L.D. 401, No. H-257 (127th\nLegis. 2015). The additional language will provide a defendant with relief pursuant to M.R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) if a complaint does not certify such proof.\n\f10\n\n          [¶14] The law, the rules of evidence, and court processes have not become\n\nmore complicated in these matters.                   Applying established law, however, has\n\nbecome more problematic as courts address the problems the financial services\n\nindustry has created for itself.11 See, e.g., Greenleaf, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">ME</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 8-17, 24-27,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.
