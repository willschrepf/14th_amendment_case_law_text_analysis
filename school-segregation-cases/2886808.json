Moles, proceeding pro se, appeals an order of the United States District\n\fCourt for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denying his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. For the following reasons, we will affirm.\n\n       Moles is a prisoner at the Federal Correctional Institution at Schuylkill in\n\nMinersville, Pennsylvania (“FCI-Schuylkill”), currently serving a ten-year sentence for\n\nbeing a felon in possession of a firearm. In 2005, a verbal altercation took place between\n\nMoles and Corrections Officer Daniel Bensinger as Moles was awaiting transfer by bus\n\nfrom the United States Penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to FCI-Schuylkill. As a\n\nresult, Moles was charged with three violations of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”)\n\ndisciplinary code, including committing insolence towards a staff member, interfering\n\nwith staff in the performance of duties, and engaging in conduct interfering with the\n\nsecurity or orderly running of a BOP facility. After a hearing at FCI-Schuylkill, at which\n\nMoles contested the charges and presented the testimony of three witnesses, the\n\ndisciplinary hearing officer (“DHO”) found that the weight of the evidence supported the\n\ncharge that Moles acted insolently towards Bensinger. The other two charges were\n\nexpunged as redundant. In his report, the DHO explained his finding of culpability by\n\nidentifying inconsistencies in the testimony of Moles and his witnesses, and noting\n\nMoles’ poor attitude during the hearing process. The DHO sanctioned Moles by placing\n\nhim in disciplinary segregation for fifteen days, disallowing thirteen days of earned good\n\nconduct time, ordering forfeiture of six days of non-vested good conduct time, and\n\nrevoking commissary, visit, and phone privileges for one year. After filing unsuccessful\n\nadministrative appeals, Moles submitted the instant § 2241 petition challenging the\n\n                                              2\n\fDHO’s finding.1\n\n       Moles asserts in his petition that his constitutional rights were violated because he\n\nwas prevented from calling additional witnesses at the disciplinary hearing, the DHO’s\n\nfinding was not supported by sufficient evidence, the DHO was biased, and the\n\npunishment was excessive. He also alleges that the prison violated BOP regulations by\n\nnot conducting an adequate investigation prior to the disciplinary hearing. The District\n\nCourt denied the petition on the merits, and Moles now appeals. We have jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1291. In reviewing a district court’s denial of habeas relief, we\n\nexercise plenary review over findings of law and defer to findings of fact unless they are\n\nclearly erroneous. See Lambert v. Blackwell, 134 F.3d 506, 512 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n       Moles argues that the DHO’s finding of culpability was not supported by sufficient\n\nevidence. A sanction imposed by a prison disciplinary board reducing a prisoner’s good-\n\ntime credits must be supported by “some evidence in the record” to satisfy the\n\nrequirements of due process. See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445,\n\n454-56 (1985). A court need not undertake a searching inquiry to ascertain the presence\n\nof “some evidence” supporting a disciplinary ruling; the “relevant question is whether\n\nthere is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the\n\n\n   1\n     A prisoner may file a habeas petition challenging a disciplinary sanction that affects\nthe fact or duration of his confinement. See 28 U.S.C. § 2241; Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411\nU.S. 475, 500 (1973). The DHO’s ruling affects the length of Moles’ sentence because it\nreduces his good conduct time, and Moles may file the instant petition for the purpose of\nobtaining restoration of that time. See Brown v. Fauver, 819 F.2d 395, 397 (3d Cir.\n1987).\n\n                                             3\n\fdisciplinary board.” Id. at 455-56 (emphasis added). The DHO’s report refers to such\n\nevidence. In the section of the report entitled “Specific Evidence Relied on to Support\n\nFindings,” the DHO cites to and quotes from Bensinger’s incident report, which details\n\nMoles’ verbal abuse towards Bensinger. The sufficiency standard is met where a DHO\n\nsupports a finding of culpability solely by reference to an incident report compiled by a\n\ncorrections officer. See Hudson v. Johnson, 242 F.3d 534, 536-37 (5th Cir. 2001);\n\nMcPherson v. McBride, 188 F.3d 784, 786 (7th Cir. 1999). Moles also argues that the\n\nDHO did not give proper weight to his testimony and the testimony of the inmate\n\nwitnesses. However, a challenge that goes to the weight of the evidence is irrelevant to\n\nthe issue of whether the DHO’s finding had a constitutionally sufficient evidentiary basis.\n\nSee Thompson v. Owens, 889 F.2d 500, 502 (3d Cir. 1989) (citing Hill, 472 U.S. at 455).\n\n       Moles next contends that his right to procedural due process was violated because\n\nhe was unable to contact or call approximately fourteen additional witnesses. He claims\n\nthat he should have been permitted to contact every inmate who witnessed the incident\n\nand request their appearance at the disciplinary hearing. He also claims that he was\n\nimproperly denied an opportunity to elicit the testimony of Lieutenant Larry Weir, an\n\nofficial at the Lewisburg facility who was allegedly present during the altercation but\n\nunavailable for the hearing. Moles maintains that all of these witnesses would have\n\ndisputed the version of events recounted in Bensinger’s incident report.\n\n       A prisoner facing charges that may result in a loss of good-time credits has a due\n\nprocess right to call witnesses at a disciplinary hearing “when permitting him to do so\n\n                                             4\n\fwill not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.” Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 566 (1974). Prison officials have broad discretion in\n\nadministering a disciplinary hearing, see Young v. Kann, 926 F.2d 1396, 1400 (3d Cir.\n\n1991), and it is not a denial of due process to deny an inmate an opportunity to present\n\nwitnesses “whose testimony would be irrelevant, repetitive, or unnecessary.” Pannell v.\n\nMcBride, 306 F.3d 499, 503 (7th Cir. 2002); see also 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(c) (providing\n\nthat “the DHO need not call repetitive witnesses”). The United States argues that the\n\ndisciplinary hearing proceeded without the additional witnesses because their testimony\n\nwould have been cumulative. Indeed, Moles does not explain how the testimony of the\n\nabsent witnesses would have been materially different from the testimony of the three\n\nwitnesses whom he called at the hearing. We therefore agree with the District Court that\n\nprison officials did not act improperly by not allowing Moles to call additional witnesses.\n\n         Moles also argues that he was denied his due process right to a fair and impartial\n\nhearing officer.2 He alleges that the DHO’s hostility towards the defense witnesses and\n\nundue deference towards Bensinger’s incident report are evidence of bias. Upon\n\nreviewing the record, we conclude that these allegations fall short of evidencing the sort\n\nof egregious behavior that constitutes a due process violation. See Withrow v. Larkin,\n\n421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975); Robinson v. State of New Jersey, 806 F.2d 442, 450 (3d Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n\n   2\n    The District Court did not address this claim, but we will address it because it was\nargued in the reply brief that Moles submitted to the District Court.\n\n                                               5\n\f       The District Court correctly denied the remaining constitutional claims. Moles has\n\nnot shown that the sanctions imposed by the DHO were unconstitutionally excessive. See\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995) (invalidating sanctions that “impose[]\n\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life”). We also reject any claim that the disciplinary hearing was conducted in\n\nviolation of an asserted Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\n\nSee Wolff, 418 U.S. at 567-68.\n\n       Finally, Moles alleges that prison officials did not conduct a thorough investigation\n\ninto the allegations raised by the incident report, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 541.14(b)(2).3\n\nHe argues that a proper investigation, in accordance with BOP policies, would have\n\nrequired prison officials to identify and question additional witnesses, and those witnesses\n\nwould have given exculpatory statements. We note that a failure to conduct a prompt and\n\nthorough investigation prior to a disciplinary hearing does not rise to the level of a due\n\nprocess violation. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 454. Moreover, Moles has failed to show that the\n\nalleged oversight caused him prejudice. As we have explained, prison officials afforded\n\nMoles an adequate opportunity to refute the charges at the disciplinary hearing and the\n\nrecord clearly indicates that the DHO gave due consideration to the testimony presented\n\n\n   3\n     This provision states, in relevant part, that “[t]he investigat[ing officer] shall . . .\nthoroughly investigate the incident. The investigator shall record all steps and actions\ntaken on the Incident Report and forward all relevant material to the staff holding the\ninitial hearing . . . . [I]f the case is ultimately forwarded to the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nthe DHO shall give a copy of the investigation and other relevant materials to the\ninmate’s staff representative for use in presentation on the inmate's behalf.”\n\n                                               6\n\fby Moles and his three witnesses.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court properly denied Moles’\n\nhabeas petition. Accordingly, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f",

Moles, proceeding pro se, appeals an order of the United States District\n\fCourt for the Middle District of Pennsylvania denying his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241.

Fauver, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488735\"><a href=\"/opinion/488735/ralph-brown-v-william-h-fauver-commissioner-of-corrections-elaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 397 (3d Cir.\n1987).\n\n                                             3\n\fdisciplinary board.” Id. at 455-56 (emphasis added). The DHO’s report refers to such\n\nevidence. In the section of the report entitled “Specific Evidence Relied on to Support\n\nFindings,” the DHO cites to and quotes from Bensinger’s incident report, which details\n\nMoles’ verbal abuse towards Bensinger. The sufficiency standard is met where a DHO\n\nsupports a finding of culpability solely by reference to an incident report compiled by a\n\ncorrections officer. See Hudson v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"23177\"><a href=\"/opinion/23177/hudson-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536-37 (5th Cir. 2001);\n\nMcPherson v. McBride, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765788\"><a href=\"/opinion/765788/monte-mcpherson-v-daniel-r-mcbride/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 786 (7th Cir. 1999). Moles also argues that the\n\nDHO did not give proper weight to his testimony and the testimony of the inmate\n\nwitnesses. However, a challenge that goes to the weight of the evidence is irrelevant to\n\nthe issue of whether the DHO’s finding had a constitutionally sufficient evidentiary basis.\n\nSee Thompson v. Owens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532052\"><a href=\"/opinion/532052/david-thompson-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 502 (3d Cir. 1989) (citing Hill, 472 U.S. at 455).\n\n       Moles next contends that his right to procedural due process was violated because\n\nhe was unable to contact or call approximately fourteen additional witnesses. He claims\n\nthat he should have been permitted to contact every inmate who witnessed the incident\n\nand request their appearance at the disciplinary hearing. He also claims that he was\n\nimproperly denied an opportunity to elicit the testimony of Lieutenant Larry Weir, an\n\nofficial at the Lewisburg facility who was allegedly present during the altercation but\n\nunavailable for the hearing. Moles maintains that all of these witnesses would have\n\ndisputed the version of events recounted in Bensinger’s incident report.\n\n       A prisoner facing charges that may result in a loss of good-time credits has a due\n\nprocess right to call witnesses at a disciplinary hearing “when permitting him to do so\n\n                                             4\n\fwill not be unduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.” Wolff v.\n\nMcDonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (1974). Prison officials have broad discretion in\n\nadministering a disciplinary hearing, see Young v. Kann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556616\"><a href=\"/opinion/556616/kenneth-mcclure-young-ii-v-warren-kann-and-jane-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1400 (3d Cir.\n\n1991), and it is not a denial of due process to deny an inmate an opportunity to present\n\nwitnesses “whose testimony would be irrelevant, repetitive, or unnecessary.” Pannell v.\n\nMcBride, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779381\"><a href=\"/opinion/779381/david-pannell-v-daniel-r-mcbride-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (7th Cir. 2002); see also 28 C.F.R. § 541.17(c) (providing\n\nthat “the DHO need not call repetitive witnesses”). The United States argues that the\n\ndisciplinary hearing proceeded without the additional witnesses because their testimony\n\nwould have been cumulative. Indeed, Moles does not explain how the testimony of the\n\nabsent witnesses would have been materially different from the testimony of the three\n\nwitnesses whom he called at the hearing. We therefore agree with the District Court that\n\nprison officials did not act improperly by not allowing Moles to call additional witnesses.\n\n         Moles also argues that he was denied his due process right to a fair and impartial\n\nhearing officer.2 He alleges that the DHO’s hostility towards the defense witnesses and\n\nundue deference towards Bensinger’s incident report are evidence of bias. Upon\n\nreviewing the record, we conclude that these allegations fall short of evidencing the sort\n\nof egregious behavior that constitutes a due process violation. See Withrow v. Larkin,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109237\"><a href=\"/opinion/109237/withrow-v-larkin/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1975); Robinson v. State of New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450 (3d Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n\n   2\n    The District Court did not address this claim, but we will address it because it was\nargued in the reply brief that Moles submitted to the District Court.\n\n                                               5\n\f       The District Court correctly denied the remaining constitutional claims. Moles has\n\nnot shown that the sanctions imposed by the DHO were unconstitutionally excessive. See\n\nSandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995) (invalidating sanctions that “impose[]\n\natypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of\n\nprison life”). We also reject any claim that the disciplinary hearing was conducted in\n\nviolation of an asserted Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.\n\nSee Wolff, 418 U.S. at 567-68.\n\n       Finally, Moles alleges that prison officials did not conduct a thorough investigation\n\ninto the allegations raised by the incident report, as required by 28 C.F.R. § 541.14(b)(2).3\n\nHe argues that a proper investigation, in accordance with BOP policies, would have\n\nrequired prison officials to identify and question additional witnesses, and those witnesses\n\nwould have given exculpatory statements. We note that a failure to conduct a prompt and\n\nthorough investigation prior to a disciplinary hearing does not rise to the level of a due\n\nprocess violation. See Hill, 472 U.S. at 454. Moreover, Moles has failed to show that the\n\nalleged oversight caused him prejudice. As we have explained, prison officials afforded\n\nMoles an adequate opportunity to refute the charges at the disciplinary hearing and the\n\nrecord clearly indicates that the DHO gave due consideration to the testimony presented\n\n\n   3\n     This provision states, in relevant part, that “[t]he investigat[ing officer] shall . . .\nthoroughly investigate the incident. The investigator shall record all steps and actions\ntaken on the Incident Report and forward all relevant material to the staff holding the\ninitial hearing . . . . [I]f the case is ultimately forwarded to the Discipline Hearing Officer,\nthe DHO shall give a copy of the investigation and other relevant materials to the\ninmate’s staff representative for use in presentation on the inmate's behalf.”\n\n                                               6\n\fby Moles and his three witnesses.\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court properly denied Moles’\n\nhabeas petition. Accordingly, we will affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\f</pre>",
