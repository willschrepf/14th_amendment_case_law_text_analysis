Estrada, a federal prisoner who is incarcerated at the Allenwood\n\nUnited States Penitentiary (“USP-Allenwood”), challenged the Bureau of Prison’s\n\n\n                                            1\n\fregulation prohibiting threatening another with bodily harm on the grounds that it was\n\nvoid for vagueness. Estrada also alleged that the disciplinary proceedings held regarding\n\nhis violation of this regulation denied him due process. For the following reasons, we\n\nwill affirm the order of the District Court.\n\n              Upset about a job change, Estrada approached his female unit manager in\n\nthe prison dining hall during the noon meal. Estrada concedes that he addressed her with\n\na loud and boisterous tone of voice, and that each time he spoke to her he stepped towards\n\nher direction. Estrada was told to settle down, and when he did not, he was escorted from\n\nthe dining hall to the Special Housing Unit. Estrada’s unit manager then wrote an\n\nincident report charging Estrada with threatening another with bodily harm in violation of\n\nCode 203. An investigation was initiated which included interviews with Estrada and a\n\nprison employee who witnessed the incident. A Unit Disciplinary Committee (“UDC”)\n\nhearing was convened in March 2005. The UDC then referred the charges to the\n\nDisciplinary Hearing Officer (“DHO”) for further proceedings.\n\n              A DHO hearing was convened in April 2005. DHO K. Bittenbender\n\ndetermined that upon consideration of Estrada’s size, mannerisms, movements, and tone\n\nof voice during the incident, Estrada had committed the prohibited act of threatening\n\nanother with bodily harm or any other offense in violation of Code 203. Estrada was\n\nsanctioned to a thirty day term of disciplinary segregation, a one year loss of telephone\n\nand visiting privileges, a twenty-one day loss of good conduct time and a sixty day loss of\n\nnon-vested good conduct time. Estrada filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus under 28\n\n                                               2\n\fU.S.C. § 2241 seeking reinstatement of his good conduct time and privileges. The\n\nDistrict Court denied his petition.\n\n              We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). We\n\nexercise plenary review of a district court’s legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding; any\n\nfactual determinations made by the district court will be upheld unless found to be clearly\n\nerroneous. See Wilson v. Beard, 426 F.3d 653, 659 (3d Cir. 2005).\n\n              On appeal, Estrada does not dispute the District Court’s conclusion that the\n\nDHO’s decision was based upon “some evidence.” Rather, Estrada contends that he was\n\ndenied due process because: (1) Code 203 is unconstitutionally vague; and (2) his UDC\n\nhearing was held a few days late.1 For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the District\n\nCourt’s order.\n\n              Estrada contends that Code 203 is unconstitutionally vague. We disagree.\n\nEstrada was charged with violating Code 203, which prohibits threatening another with\n\nbodily harm or any other offense. See 28 C.F.R. § 541.13, Table 3. We have long\n\n“reject[ed] the view that the degree of specificity required of [prison] regulations is as\n\nstrict in every instance as that required of ordinary criminal sanctions.” Meyers v.\n\nAlldredge, 492 F.2d 296, 310 (3d Cir. 1974). “Prisoners, unlike free men, must well\n\nknow that they are considered potentially dangerous men and must expect to be highly\n\n\n              1\n                 Estrada also argues that the investigation of the incident was inadequate,\nthe incident report was vague, and the disciplinary process was not impartial. Because\nEstrada did not raise these arguments in the District Court, we decline to reach them here.\n\n\n                                              3\n\fregimented. In such cases the law requires less in the way of notice, and places a greater\n\nburden on the individual to make inquiry or ask permission before acting.” Id. at 311\n\n(quoting Landman v. Royster, 333 F. Supp. 621, 655-56 (E.D. Va. 1971)). Given\n\nEstrada’s status as a prisoner, his size, his admittedly loud and boisterous tone of voice,\n\nand the fact that he continually stepped towards the female employee during the incident,\n\nEstrada should have realized that his actions could constitute a violation of Code 203.\n\n              Estrada also contends that he was deprived of due process because his UDC\n\nhearing was held six days late. Having carefully reviewed the District Court record, we\n\nfind no error in its decision to deny Estrada habeas corpus relief. The District Court\n\ncorrectly determined that Estrada was afforded all of the process that he was due under\n\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974).\n\n              For these reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court dismissing\n\nEstrada’s habeas petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
