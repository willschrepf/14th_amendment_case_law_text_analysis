Ramirez argues that the district court\n\nimproperly dismissed his claims that (1) prison officials violated\n\nthe Eighth Amendment by failing to protect him from injuries\n\nincurred during a prison gang war; (2) he was investigated as a\n\n     *\n        Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined\nthat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent\nexcept under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f                                No. 01-40206\n                                     -2-\n\nsuspected gang member solely because he is of Hispanic descent; and\n\n(3) he was denied due process when he was placed in administrative\n\nsegregation without benefit of a prior hearing.\n\n       Not every injury “by one prisoner at the hands of another\n\n. . . translates into constitutional liability for prison officials\n\nresponsible for the victim’s safety.”          Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S.\n\n825,   834   (1994).    Ramirez       has   failed   to    show    that     he   was\n\n“incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious\n\nharm and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his\n\nneed for protection.”       Neals v. Norwood, 59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.\n\n1995).       Accordingly,     the   district   court      did   not    abuse     its\n\ndiscretion in dismissing Ramirez’ Eighth Amendment failure-to-\n\nprotect claim as frivolous.         Siglar v. Hightower, 112 F.3d 191, 193\n\n(5th Cir. 1997).\n\n       “The equal protection clause is not violated solely because an\n\naction   has   a   racially    disproportionate      impact       if   it   is   not\n\nmotivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.”                       Coleman v.\n\nFranklin Parish Sch. Bd., 702 F.2d 74, 77 (5th Cir. 1983).                  Because\n\nRamirez’ complaint rests on conclusions alone, he has failed to\n\nstate a claim for an equal protection violation.                See Schultea v.\n\nWood, 47 F.3d 1427, 1433 (5th Cir. 1995)(en banc).              After a de novo\n\nreview of this claim, we conclude that it was properly dismissed\n\nfor failure to state a claim.        Ruiz v. United States, 160 F.3d 273,\n\n275 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n       Finally, Ramirez’ claim that he was denied due process prior\n\nto being placed in administrative segregation while his suspected\n\ngang affiliation was being investigated is meritless.                   “[A]bsent\n\f                            No. 01-40206\n                                 -3-\n\nextraordinary circumstances, administrative segregation as such,\n\nbeing an incident to the ordinary life of a prisoner, will never be\n\na ground for a constitutional claim because it simply does not\n\nconstitute a deprivation of a constitutionally cognizable liberty\n\ninterest.”   Martin v. Scott, 156 F.3d 578, 580 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\nTherefore, the district court properly dismissed this claim as\n\nfrivolous.   Siglar, 112 F.3d at 193.\n\n     The district court’s dismissal of Ramirez’ complaint for\n\nfailure to state a claim and as frivolous counts as a “strike” for\n\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).   See Adepegba v. Hammons, 103 F.3d\n\n383, 385 (5th Cir. 1996).   Ramirez is warned that if he accumulated\n\nthree “strikes,” he will no longer be allowed to proceed IFP in any\n\ncivil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained\n\nin any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious\n\nphysical injury.   See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\f",
