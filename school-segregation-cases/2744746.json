McAdams, deceased, brings this appeal from a judgment against her in a\r\nlawsuit brought by her son J.Y. Jr. McAdams (J.T.) or his wife Annie McAdams (Annie) for\r\ndamages resulting from a breach of her fiduciary duty as executrix of the estate.  Although\r\nthe parties are familiar with the somewhat complicated procedural and factual background,\r\nwe will recite it in the detail necessary to a proper discussion of the issues presented for\r\nour decision.  For reasons we later express, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.Y. McAdams died in 1974 survived by his wife Ima, and the couple's four children,\r\nJ.T., Coretha Brown,<sup> (1)</sup></span><span> Barbara Billups (Barbara) and Margaret Ward.  He left a will in which\r\nIma was appointed as independent executrix of his estate.  In his will, he stated that all of\r\nhis property was community. He bequeathed his wife a life estate in his community one-half interest with remainder over to his children, share and share alike.  In pertinent part,\r\nthe will also provided:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tThe said Ima L. McAdams shall have the use, benefit, and enjoyment\r\nof said property during her natural life and shall also have the right and\r\npower to use or invade the body of my estate to whatever extent as may be\r\nnecessary to provide for her welfare, support and maintenance in the\r\nmanner to which she is accustomed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tDuring the existence of my said wife's life estate she shall also have\r\nfull power and authority to change the form of any or all of the corpus of my\r\nestate by sales, exchanges, encumbrances, investments, purchases or other\r\ndespositions [sic] or acquisitions, to the extent deemed advisable by my said\r\nwife in her discretion, all without being liable for any loss incurred in her\r\nexercise of such discretion in good faith.  In connection with her exercise of\r\nany such powers, any other party dealing with her shall receive as good a\r\ntitle to anything transferred by my said wife as if my said wife had been the\r\nfee simple owner thereof, and such other party shall not be required to follow\r\nor inquire into the application or disposition of the consideration paid by such\r\nother party.  However, by proper accounting or otherwise, my said wife shall\r\nsegregate or maintain the separate identity of the corpus of my estate,\r\nregardless of whether such corpus remains in its original form or is\r\nconverted to some other form by her exercise of any of the powers\r\nhereinabove granted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>At trial, Ima testified that she never took any funds from the corpus of the estate to pay for\r\nher welfare, support, or maintenance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the underlying suit, J.T. and Annie originally sued Ima and Barbara concerning\r\na dispute over a McAdams farm partnership and a claimed breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,\r\nand conspiracy with respect to Ima's administration of the estate.  At trial, the court\r\nrendered a take-nothing judgment, which was appealed to this court.  In the course of\r\ndisposing of that appeal, we reversed and remanded that portion of the trial court judgment\r\ndecreeing that J.T. take nothing on his claims against Ima and Barbara arising from the\r\ndistribution of the estate of J.Y. McAdams.  This appeal results from the retrial of that\r\nportion of the suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the judgment giving rise to this appeal, the trial court held that J.T. should recover\r\ndamages based upon a fraudulent inducement to sign a release of claims arising from the\r\ndistribution of the estate.  It held that J.T. was entitled to recover damages of $235,083 as\r\nhis 25% share of the $940,332 the court found resulted from a diversion of funds by Ima\r\nfrom the corpus of the estate.  The trial court further decreed that J.T. take nothing against\r\nBarbara, that Ima be removed as executrix of the estate, and awarded attorney fees and\r\nprejudgment interest.  The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in\r\nsupport of its judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt issue are several transactions that occurred during the administration of the\r\nestate.<sup> (2)</sup></span><span>  These include 1) a loan of $501,000 made to J.T. by the estate and Ima, 2) a sale\r\nof some property by the estate to Barbara for $47,000, 3) the purchase of the Keyes Farm\r\nin Oklahoma by Ima, J.T., and Annie, with the estate contributing part of the money for the\r\npurchase, and the subsequent sale of the same property, and 4) a loan given by the estate\r\nfor the purchase of an elevator on the Bohlender property.  After those transactions, Ima\r\noffered to make a cash distribution to the remaindermen in exchange for a release of all\r\nclaims or liabilities against her.  In doing so, she represented the value of the corpus of the\r\nestate to be $471,513.19, and J.T. subsequently received $117,878.29, which was one-fourth of the $471,513.19 figure.  When he filed his suit, J.T. averred that the corpus of the\r\nestate was actually much greater than that amount. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn pursuing her appeal, Ima presents 12 issues for our decision.  In the first eight\r\nof her issues, she challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the trial court's findings\r\nthat 1) $84,000 was diverted from the proceeds of a $501,000 loan made by the estate to\r\nJ.T. and Annie, 2) $60,000 was diverted from the proceeds of a Bohlender elevator note,\r\n3) $623,333 was diverted from the repayment of the loans made to obtain the Keyes Farm,\r\nand 4) $172,990 in lost profits to the estate occurred as a result of the sale of the Keyes\r\nFarm.  In her four remaining issues, Ima asks if 9) by electing to confirm the release,\r\nconveyance, and consent to distribution, J.T. has waived his standing to seek Ima's\r\nremoval as executrix of the estate, 10) J.T. is entitled to keep the funds paid him under the\r\nconveyance, release, and consent to distribution and at the same time rescind the\r\nagreement, 11) the award of attorney fees is mandatory, and 12) she, Ima, is entitled to\r\na $25,000 offset to the judgment together with interest as the result of another judgment\r\nshe had recovered against J.T. and Annie.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs cross-appellant, J.T. asks if 1) the record conclusively shows that Ima caused\r\ndamage to the estate of J.Y. McAdams in excess of the damages found by the court in its\r\njudgment with respect to the diversion of proceeds, or 2) alternatively, whether the trial\r\ncourt's finding as to the amount of those damages is against the great weight of the\r\nevidence, 3) the trial court improperly failed to award damages against Barbara for\r\nconspiracy in the sale of land to her because the record conclusively demonstrates\r\notherwise or because the trial court's finding otherwise is against the great weight of the\r\nevidence, 4) the trial court improperly calculated the amount of prejudgment interest, 5)\r\nthe trial court abused its discretion in failing to award the entire amount of attorney's fees\r\nproved at trial, and 6) the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award exemplary\r\ndamages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a no-evidence issue, we consider the evidence and reasonable\r\ninferences from that evidence which, viewed in their most favorable light, support the trial\r\ncourt findings, disregarding all evidence and inferences to the contrary.  <em>Lewelling v.\r\nLewelling</em>, 796 S.W.2d 164, 166 (Tex. 1990).  If more than a scintilla of evidence supports\r\nthe finding, the no-evidence challenge fails.  <em>Id</em>.  In reviewing a factual insufficiency\r\nchallenge, we review all the evidence and reverse only if the challenged finding is so\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. \r\n<em>In re King's Estate</em>, 150 Tex. 662, 244 S.W.2d 660, 661 (1951).  The trier of fact is the sole\r\njudge of the credibility and the weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses.  <em>See\r\nMcGalliard v. Kuhlmann</em>, 722 S.W.2d 694, 697 (Tex. 1986).  Because both parties question\r\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's award of damages with respect\r\nto the specific transactions enumerated, we will address each of those transactions\r\nseparately. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Ima's first two issues, the subject transaction is a $501,000 loan made in 1988\r\nto effect a bankruptcy settlement.  In its findings of fact with regard to this loan, the trial\r\ncourt found \"Ima diverted to her own use and benefit $84,000.00 by taking the funds repaid\r\nto the Estate.\"  Ima denies there was any diversion of this money, while J.T. claims that the\r\nentire amount was diverted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.T. and Annie executed a $501,000 note to Ima as executrix, which was secured\r\nby a deed of trust on land in Dallam County.  The note was eventually paid and the deed\r\nof trust released on December 14, 1995. With regard to the diversion, J.T. points to Ima's\r\ntestimony that at the time she calculated the corpus of the estate prior to distribution, she\r\ndid not include as an asset any credit for the $501,000 note balance.  The history of\r\npayments made on the note is confusing.  Ima also testified that at the time of this loan,\r\nshe did not have $501,000 in the estate, so she borrowed some money on certificates of\r\ndeposit owned by the estate.  Later, $430,000 (apparently the proceeds of the sale of\r\nsome cattle by J.T.) was wire transferred to Ima's personal account.  Both Ima and J.T.\r\ndenied giving instructions that this money be wired to Ima's personal account.  With the\r\nmoney, Ima averred that she bought certificates of deposit totaling $350,000 in the name\r\nof the estate, and the remainder of $80,000 she applied to a $275,000 debt J.T. owed her\r\npersonally.  J.T. also gave Ima a check for $100,000 made out to her individually, which,\r\nshe said, was applied to the estate corpus. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t However, Jordan Mills, an accountant who testified for J.T., reviewed the bank\r\nrecords and ledger accounts kept by Ima, and averred that out of payments made on the\r\n$501,000 note, he could only find that $100,000 was paid to the estate.  He also said that\r\nalthough the note called for 9% interest, he was never able to compute exactly what\r\ninterest may have been paid on the note.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, the evidence is disputed as to how much of the $501,000 loan was actually\r\nrepaid to the estate.  From the record, we are unable to tell exactly how the trial court\r\narrived at the figure of $84,000 as the amount of the repayments Ima diverted, and neither\r\nparty has offered an explanation of that computation.  Even so, that amount is within the\r\nvariation of the disputed testimony at trial.  There is also the evidence that Ima took\r\n$80,000 from the funds repaid by J.T. and credited it to a personal loan made by her to\r\nJ.T.  Considering this with the other evidence, the trial court could have rationally arrived\r\nat the $84,000 figure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, J.T. contends the amount of money actually repaid to the estate is\r\nirrelevant because it is undisputed that Ima did not include the proceeds of the $501,000\r\nnote in the corpus of the estate used to compute the distribution.  However, there was\r\ntestimony that the estate did not have $501,000 at the time the loan was made and that\r\nIma borrowed the money, using as collateral certificates of deposit owned by the estate. \r\nThus, if that testimony was accepted by the factfinder, it supports an inference that the\r\n$501,000 was not originally in the corpus of the estate but was borrowed, was then\r\neventually paid back to the lender, and therefore should not have been included in the\r\ncorpus as J.T. contends.  Ima's first two issues are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn considering Ima's third and fourth issues, we must consider whether the trial court\r\nwas incorrect in awarding $60,000 in damages for funds diverted from the Bohlender\r\nelevator note proceeds.  Parenthetically, J.T. does not challenge this award.  In 1985, the\r\nestate and Ima loaned $60,000 each to the Bohlenders to build a grain elevator on land\r\npurchased from the estate.  To secure that amount, the Bohlenders executed a note in that\r\namount secured by a deed of trust.  The note was repaid and Ima testified that although\r\nshe did not give a special credit for the estate's $60,000 in calculating the estate's value,\r\nit was already included in the corpus of the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIma also testified that when she received repayments on money the estate had\r\nloaned, she deposited both principal and interest into the same bank account, although\r\nshe attempted to keep separate records herself as to what constituted principal and\r\ninterest.  There were no estate records per se to show whether repayments of money it\r\nloaned was corpus of the estate or was interest.  At trial, the court found that Ima had\r\ndiverted to her own use $60,000 that belonged to the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.T. argues that it was Ima's burden to show that the estate's money was returned\r\nto the estate because she had admitted that she commingled her individual and estate\r\nfunds.  Ima argues there was no proof that she improperly retained the estate's money and\r\nthe trial court erred in finding to the contrary.  In that connection, viewed in the light by\r\nwhich we must view it, the evidence is both legally and factually sufficient to support the\r\ntrial court's resolution of this question.  In that regard, the evidence clearly shows that\r\ncontrary to the instructions in the will, with respect to money loaned by the estate, Ima\r\ncommingled the interest and corpus of repayments made on the loan.  Although Ima\r\nasserts that the $60,000 was included in the corpus of the estate for distribution, the\r\nrecord does not show she was able to trace those repayments to show their inclusion in\r\nthat corpus.  <em>See Eaton v. Husted</em>, 141 Tex. 349, 172 S.W.2d 493, 498-99 (1943).  Ima's\r\nthird and fourth issues are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining Ima's fifth and sixth issues, we must examine the purchase of the\r\nKeyes Farm.  With respect to that transaction, the trial court found that Ima had diverted\r\nto her use and benefit $623,333 that belonged to the estate.  In 1989, J.T. and Ima\r\npurchased a farm near Keyes, Oklahoma, for $1,100,000.  Although J.T. and Annie\r\nreceived a 2/3 interest in the farm with Ima receiving the other 1/3 interest, all of the money\r\ncame from Ima and the estate.  To finance the purchase, ostensibly J.T. borrowed\r\n$366,666.66 from the estate and the same amount from Ima individually.  However, Ima's\r\nledger sheets show, and she admitted, that the estate actually contributed 85%, or\r\n$623,333.05 of the money loaned to J.T.  Ima did not say whether the remainder of the\r\nmoney advanced came from estate funds or her separate funds.  She admitted that if the\r\nmoney was repaid, the estate corpus would receive only $366,666.66, which was less than\r\nactually came from estate funds.  Ima admitted that she did not give any credit for the\r\nestate's contribution to the purchase price when she calculated the amount for distribution\r\nof the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIma testified that although J.T. paid some interest on the notes executed by him, no\r\nprincipal was ever paid.  The farm was sold in 1994 for approximately $2,000,000.  Of the\r\nprofit, two-thirds went to J.T. and one-third to Ima.  The loans against the property were\r\npaid off at the time of the sale.  Both Ima and J.T. directed the title company in writing to\r\ndistribute the remainder of the sale proceeds after the liens were paid, with $594,473\r\ngoing to J.T. and Annie and $663,904.02 going to Ima.  Of the approximately $1,397,000\r\nthat she received from the sale, including the repayment of the loans and the portion of the\r\nremainder paid to her, Ima did not return any of those funds to the estate, but placed them\r\nin a certificate of deposit in her own name. The evidence is therefore both legally and\r\nfactually sufficient to support the trial court's finding that she diverted $623,333 from the\r\nestate.  Ima's fifth and sixth issues are overruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note J.T.'s first cross-issue contention that the evidence actually supports an\r\naward to him of $920,318.64 with respect to the loans made in connection with the\r\npurchase of the Keyes Farm.  This is so, he argues, because the evidence is\r\nuncontroverted that the estate contributed more than $623,333 to its purchase.  Jordan\r\nMills testified that Ima kept a lot of the estate money in certificates of deposit in the estate's\r\nname.  In trying to determine where the money for the purchase of the farm came from,\r\nMills looked at bank statements, checks, and deposit slips.  He claimed to have been able\r\nto trace the amount of estate money used to purchase the farm to an amount of\r\n$920,318.04 based on a ledger sheet used by Ima showing various bank deposits which\r\nwere gathered to make up the purchase price of the farm.  Further, because the total price\r\nwas $1,101,476 and $920,318.64 is 83.55% of that amount and, because he saw some\r\nmargin notations on Ima's balance sheets showing 85% attributable to the estate and 15%\r\nattributable to J.T., Mills believed his figure was correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, there was conflicting testimony from Ima and Mills as to the amount of funds\r\ncontributed by the estate to the purchase of the Keyes Farm with Ima testifying that the\r\nestate only contributed 85% of the money loaned to J.T. while he contends, supported by\r\nMills's testimony, the correct amount was 85% of the total purchase price.  Because it was\r\nwithin the trial court's special prerogative as the trier of fact to resolve factual disputes, we\r\nwill not disturb the trial court finding.  Ima's seventh issue is overruled. \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe $172,999 included in the trial court's findings as the estate's lost profit on the\r\nKeyes Farm transaction is the subject of Ima's seventh and eighth issues.  While she\r\ncontends the evidence does not support that inclusion, J.T. contends the amount of profit\r\nattributable to the estate was actually $297,236.78.  The parties agree that the farm was\r\npurchased for $1,100,000 and sold for $2,000,000.  Therefore, the profit on the sale was\r\napproximately $900,000.  The parties also agree that Ima was entitled to one-third of the\r\nprofit or approximately $300,000.  If the estate contributed $623,333.05 to the purchase\r\nprice of the farm, as the trial court apparently found, that contribution amounted to about\r\n57% of the purchase price.  The same percentage of Ima's share of the profit is\r\napproximately $171,000.  Although that figure is not the exact amount of the lost profit\r\nfound by the court, it is sufficiently close to sustain the trial court's findings.  Additionally,\r\nas we have noted, Ima admitted she had deposited all the proceeds from the sale received\r\nby her into a certificate of deposit in her name.  Ima's seventh and eighth issues are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her ninth issue, Ima argues that by electing to confirm the release, conveyance\r\nand consent to distribution, J.T. waived any right to seek her removal as executrix of the\r\nestate.  She bases that position on the argument that once J.T. elected to take his share\r\nof the distribution, he had no further interest in the estate and therefore had no standing\r\nto challenge Ima's position as the independent executrix of the estate.  In response, J.T.\r\ncontends that, although the argument might have had merit if the estate had been worth\r\nwhat Ima represented, because the trial court found it was worth much more than she had\r\nrepresented, he has not waived his right to seek her removal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t The trial court found as a matter of fact that Ima misapplied and converted estate\r\nproperty, failed to make a full disclosure, misrepresented the value of the estate, and failed\r\nto account, all of which constituted gross misconduct and gross mismanagement in the\r\nperformance of her duties, which constituted cause for her removal.  Thus, the trial court\r\nconcluded, Ima had breached her fiduciary duty and should be removed as executrix.  The\r\ntrial court further concluded that J.T. was not barred \"from seeking relief despite not\r\nactually returning consideration received under the release because he satisfied his\r\n'tender' obligation, and because he has a meritorious claim for compensation in excess of\r\nthat consideration.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe existence of standing is a question of law.  <em>A &amp; W Industries, Inc. v. Day</em>, 977\r\nS.W.2d 738, 741 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 1998, no pet.).  For a person to maintain a suit,\r\nhe must have standing to litigate the matters at issue.  Generally, that means some interest\r\npeculiar to him individually and not as a member of the general public.  <em>Id.  </em>Ima does not\r\ncontest that J.T. would have had standing to seek her removal but, as we noted above, she\r\nargues that he has waived that right.  The essence of the trial court findings was that Ima\r\nmisrepresented the value of the estate, she intended J.T. to rely on her representations,\r\nhe did to his detriment, and that he was entitled to damages above the amount of money\r\nhe originally obtained and for which he executed his release.  The trial court's findings are\r\nsufficiently supported by the record.  Because of these findings, J.T. has not waived his\r\nright to seek Ima's removal, even though he never rescinded his release.  Damages and\r\nrescission are not mutually exclusive remedies when both are needed to give complete\r\nrelief to the complaining party.  <em>See LaChalet International, Inc. v. Nowik</em>, 787 S.W.2d 101,\r\n104 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1990, no writ).  The record does not show that the estate\r\nadministration has ever been officially closed.  That being so, in order to accord J.T.\r\ncomplete relief, it was proper both to remove Ima as executrix and to allow J.T. to recover\r\nhis share of the additional value of the estate above that which he had already received. \r\nIma's ninth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMuch of our discussion above is applicable to Ima's tenth issue, in which she\r\nasserts that because J.T. elected to waive rescission of his previous release agreement,\r\nhe is bound by the sums he received under that agreement and is not entitled to receive\r\nanything above what he has already received.  However, as we have stated, a party is not\r\nnecessarily required to choose between rescission and damages when a party has been\r\nfraudulently induced to enter into a contract.  Further, as we noted in our previous opinion\r\non this matter, before J.T.'s acceptance of a benefit can create an estoppel, it must be\r\nshown that the benefit was accepted with knowledge of all material facts.  <em>Frazier v. Wynn</em>,\r\n472 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1971).  Additionally, J.T. had agreed to accept a one-fourth\r\ndistribution of the estate.  Even if that agreement was not rescinded, it does not mean that\r\nhe would not be entitled to receive a one-quarter distribution based on the true value of\r\nthe estate as opposed to the represented value.  Ima's tenth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her eleventh issue, Ima posits that J.T. is not entitled to receive attorney's fees\r\nbecause there is no evidence that presentment of his claim was made as required by\r\nsection 38.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and a party may not recover\r\nattorney's fees for rescission of a contract.  In responding, J.T. argues that he not only\r\nsought recovery of attorney's fees under section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode, but he also sought recovery of those fees under the Property Code and the\r\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (section 37.009 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code). \r\nThose rights of recovery, he posits, have not been challenged by Ima.  In any event, he\r\ncontends, there is sufficient evidence of presentment made in his attorney's affidavit on\r\nthe subject of fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a person may\r\nrecover reasonable attorney's fees if the claim is on an oral or written contract.  Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001 (Vernon 1997).  To recover under that section, the\r\nclaimant must present the claim to the opposing party and payment for the just amount\r\nowed must not have been tendered by the opposing party before expiration of the 30<sup>th</sup> day\r\nafter presentation of the claim.  <em>Id. </em>§ 38.002.  While it is true that the filing of suit, in and\r\nof itself, does not constitute the requisite presentment, <em>Panizo v. Young Men's Christian\r\nAss'n of Greater Houston Area</em>, 938 S.W.2d 163, 168 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.] 1996,\r\nno writ), a presentment of a claim is timely even if made after suit is filed, if it is made at\r\nleast 30 days before trial.  <em>K.C. Roofing Co., Inc. v. Abundis</em>, 940 S.W.2d 375, 379 (Tex.\r\nApp.--San Antonio 1997, writ denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAttached to J.T.'s attorney's affidavit is a copy of a letter dated August 20, 1998, in\r\nwhich J.T.'s claim is presented.  While the court has discretion as to the amount of\r\nattorney's fees, their award is mandatory if the requirements are met.  <em>Jackson Law Office,\r\nP.C. v. Chappell</em>, 37 S.W.3d 15, 23 (Tex.App.--Tyler 2000, pet. denied).  Additionally,\r\nattorney's fees have been awarded based on fraud arising from a breach of contract.  <em>See\r\nGill Sav. Ass'n v. Chair King, Inc.</em>, 797 S.W.2d 31, 31-32 (Tex. 1990); <em>Schindler v. Austwell\r\nFarmers Co-op</em>, 829 S.W.2d 283, 288 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi), <em>aff'd on other grounds</em>,\r\n841 S.W.2d 853 (Tex. 1992).  Ima's eleventh issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her twelfth and final issue, Ima claims she is entitled to a $25,000 offset against\r\nthe judgment for the amount of the attorney's fees she was awarded against J.T. in the\r\nprior trial of this cause.  She also claims an offset for $117,878.29, the amount she had\r\nalready distributed to J.T., together with 10% interest per annum from the date of the\r\ndistribution.  We note that the trial court has only entered judgment for the additional sums\r\nthat should have been included in the value of the estate.  Thus, the court has not awarded\r\nJ.T. any double recovery in that regard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith regard to the offset for the $25,000 attorney fees, J.T. argues that because\r\nIma did not request such an offset from the trial court, she has waived the right to make\r\nthat claim on appeal.  Ima neither cites any authority that she is now entitled to such an\r\noffset, nor does she point out in the record where she made such a request.  However, in\r\nmaking our own review of the record, we find that she did make such a request, in addition\r\nto other requested offsets, in her first supplemental answer.  However, Ima does not cite\r\nany portions of the record in which she called that particular request to the attention of the\r\ntrial court.  Our perusal of the record reveals that the only portions of the prior judgment\r\nIma asked the trial court to take judicial notice of was with respect to two tractors and a\r\nplow, for which she was asking compensation.  Also, she did not raise that question in her\r\nmotion for new trial.  To preserve a complaint for appellate review, the record must show\r\nit was made to the trial court by a timely request, objection, or motion that stated with\r\nsufficient specificity the grounds for the ruling sought so that the trial court might be made\r\naware of the complaint.  Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A).  By failing to meet that requirement,\r\nIma has failed to preserve that complaint for our review.  Ima's twelfth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have already addressed the basis for J.T.'s first cross-issue with respect to the\r\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's awards with regard\r\nto the $501,000 loan, the Keyes Farm transaction, and the Bohlender elevator note in\r\ndiscussing Ima's contentions in that regard.  We will not, therefore, address those matters\r\nagain.  However, because we have not addressed the legal and factual sufficiency of the\r\nevidence with regard to the Billups land transaction, and because it is raised by J.T. in that\r\nissue, we will discuss that question.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a legal sufficiency challenge on an issue upon which the complaining\r\nparty had the burden of proof, we examine the record to determine if there is any evidence\r\nto support the finding while ignoring all evidence to the contrary and, if there is no\r\nevidence to support the finding, we must see if the contrary proposition had been\r\nestablished as a matter of law.  <em>Holley v. Watts</em>, 629 S.W.2d 694, 696 (Tex. 1982).  As\r\nalready stated, a factual sufficiency challenge requires us to review the record for some\r\nprobative evidence to support the finding and determine if, in light of all the evidence, the\r\nfinding is not manifestly unjust.  <em>Traylor v. Goulding</em>, 497 S.W.2d 944, 945 (Tex. 1973).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tOn February 17, 1993, Ima sold her daughter Barbara the estate's undivided one-half interest in the east one-half of Section 77 and all of Section 78, Block 2, Brooks &amp;\r\nBurleson Survey<em>, </em>in Hartley County.  Barbara executed a $47,000 note payable to Ima as\r\nthe executrix of the estate, which was secured by a deed of trust on the property.  On\r\nNovember 30, 1995, Ima, as executrix, transferred the note and the liens securing it to\r\nherself.  She then released the note and liens on October 29, 1996.  In advancing his\r\nchallenge, J.T. contends that no payment was made to the estate for this transfer and,\r\nbecause of this, the value of the estate prior to the distribution should have been increased\r\nby that amount.  The trial court did not make any award with respect to this transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIma testified that she could not produce a check for a $47,000 payment from her to\r\nthe estate or a deposit slip showing a deposit of any such amount to the estate.  She also\r\nadmitted that Barbara paid her individually the $47,000 and that she deposited the money\r\nin her individual account.  She further admitted that in calculating the value of the estate\r\nprior to her distribution, she did not add a separate credit for the $47,000, but that that\r\namount was already included in her computation of the corpus of the estate.  At the time\r\nthe estate was distributed in 1996, she had not yet been paid by Barbara.  Therefore, she\r\naverred, she had put her own money in the estate and, when Barbara paid her after\r\nBarbara had received her share of the distribution, she was entitled to put the money in\r\nher own individual account.  The trial court, in its capacity as factfinder, was entitled to\r\naccept Ima's testimony and, if accepted, as it obviously was, it is both legally and factually\r\nsufficient to uphold the trial court's refusal to award damages in that respect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.T. also contends that he should have been awarded $28,000 of the profit resulting\r\nfrom the sale of the estate's undivided one-half interest in the land to Barbara.  His\r\nargument is based on the proposition that Ima sold the land to Barbara for less than its fair\r\nmarket value.  The 960 acres was included in the inventory of the estate property at a\r\nvalue of $100 per acre or a total of $96,000.  Both Barbara and Ima said the undivided\r\ninterest in the land was sold to Barbara for $100 per acre based on its inventory value in\r\n1974.  No current appraisal of the land was made at the time of its sale, but neighboring\r\nland sold at $150 per acre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth parties presented expert testimony about the value of the land.  Steve Rogers,\r\na real estate appraiser, was called by J.T.  Rogers testified that based on information he\r\nhad gathered about comparable land sales, he estimated the value of the land on February\r\n17, 1995, at $185 per acre.  To arrive at the value of the undivided one-half interest, he\r\napplied a discount factor of 15% to 20% because a half interest is not marketed easily. \r\nBy his calculations, the interest in the land would have been worth $75,000 at the time of\r\nits sale.  However, he admitted he had never actually been on the land and had only seen\r\nit from the road.  He initially had not used the neighboring land, which had sold in his\r\ncalculations, but later went back and took it into consideration.  However, he did not\r\nchange his opinion because he felt the sale of the land was supportive of his valuation,\r\neven though it sold for substantially less than other properties he had used.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppraiser Leslie Dodson testified for Ima.  He also used the sale comparison\r\napproach in arriving at his valuation of the land in 1995.  He valued the estate's one-half\r\ninterest at $47,500 based on a value of $150 per acre with a 33 1/3% discount factor.  He\r\naverred he had used this formula before and it was an accepted method.  He had actually\r\nbeen on the land and said it was important to do so in order to know about potential water\r\nproduction on the property and its topography.  Even though it was substantially similar,\r\nhe admitted he valued the land across the road at $168 per acre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAgain, the trial court had conflicting appraisals before it.  As the factfinder, it was\r\nwell within its power to judge the credibility of the experts and the evidentiary weight to be\r\ngiven their opinion.  We cannot fault its resolution of the conflict and find no error in its\r\nrefusal to award the damages suggested by J.T.  The first two cross-issues of J.T. are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his third cross-issue, J.T. contests the trial court's refusal to award him damages\r\nagainst Barbara for conspiracy in regard to the Billups land transaction because, he\r\nreasons, the record conclusively establishes such a conspiracy or, in the alternative, the\r\ntrial court's refusal to find such a conspiracy was against the great weight of the evidence. \r\nJ.T. argues that the evidence shows Ima and Barbara acted together to transfer the\r\nestate's interest in the land for less than its fair market value and to divert money away\r\nfrom the estate, and that they failed to disclose those facts to him.  Because of their\r\nactions, he reasons, Ima and Barbara are jointly and severally liable for the value of the\r\nland which they diverted from the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe essential elements of a conspiracy are 1) two or more persons, 2) an object to\r\nbe accomplished, 3) a meeting of minds on the object or course of action, 4) one or more\r\nunlawful, overt acts, and 5) damages as the proximate result.  <em>Massey v. Armco Steel Co.</em>,\r\n652 S.W.2d 932, 934 (Tex. 1983).  Ima denied that she ever talked to Barbara about\r\nattempting to defeat the estate's interest in the land.  Further, she did not remember \r\nwhether Barbara objected to the $47,000 sale price, and she had no conversation with\r\nBarbara other than to tell her she would sell her the land.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBarbara averred that she was told the purchase price for the property would be\r\n$47,000, she did not seek an appraisal of the property and, she admitted, she did not tell\r\nJ.T. about the purchase of the property.  Although in her earlier testimony Barbara stated \r\nshe had known the property across the road sold for $150 per acre at the time she made\r\nthe purchase, at this trial, she denied that was the case.  Barbara also admitted that she\r\ndid not make a down payment on the land and that she never made any payments on the\r\nland to the estate.  Barbara additionally said that Ima told her the estate would be\r\ndistributed and Barbara could give a check in payment of the purchase loan at that time. \r\nIma had also told her that she, Ima, was going to buy the note from the estate.  Barbara \r\naverred that she and her sister Margaret prepared a summary of the estate banking\r\ntransactions after J.T.'s lawsuit was filed.  She did not remember what amounts she saw\r\nrecorded in that summary, but in her prior testimony, she had agreed that she did not see\r\nthe $47,000 payment recorded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter reviewing the evidence, we conclude that J.T. has failed to conclusively\r\nestablish that Ima and Barbara entered into a conspiracy and the trial court's failure to find\r\nsuch a conspiracy was not against the great weight of the evidence.  The testimony in the\r\nrecord shows that Ima told Barbara the estate would sell her the property and what the\r\nprice would be.  The fact that Barbara did not challenge the sale price and, even though\r\nshe may have known nearby land sold for more money, that she did not have an\r\nindependent appraisal made is not necessarily evidence that she conspired to defraud the\r\nestate.  The evidence also showed that Barbara did not know until after J.T.'s lawsuit was\r\nfiled that the estate might not have received any money for the land.  The resolution of\r\ninconsistencies in the evidence was within the trial court's power as the factfinder to\r\nresolve, and we do not find it reversibly erred in declining to award conspiracy damages\r\nagainst Barbara.  J.T.'s third cross-issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fourth cross-issue, J.T. challenges the amount of prejudgment interest\r\nawarded him.  The gist of his complaint is that the interest awarded was based on the time\r\nperiod from November 16, 1996, to April 6, 2001, even though the judgment was not\r\nsigned until May 25, 2001.  That being so, J.T. claims his entitlement to additional interest\r\nfor the period from April 6, 2001, to May 25, 2001.  Although the record shows that J.T.\r\nfiled a motion to modify the judgment to correct the amount of interest awarded, there is\r\nnothing in the record showing the trial court ever ruled on it.  Ima does not contest that J.T.\r\nwould ordinarily be entitled to prejudgment interest to the date of judgment but, she claims,\r\nJ.T. is not entitled to any additional prejudgment interest because he drafted the judgment,\r\nincluding the calculation of prejudgment interest.  Thus, he got what he requested, she\r\nasserts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe judgment itself recites that the plaintiff is awarded 6% prejudgment interest from\r\nNovember 16, 1996, \"to the date of this Judgment, in the amount of $38.64378 per day.\"\r\nThe judgment further states, \"[a]s of the date of this Judgment, the total prejudgment\r\ninterest is $61,907.34 . . . .\"  When a party moves for judgment and judgment is entered\r\nin accordance with the motion, the party waives the right to complain of the judgment on\r\nappeal.  <em>Casu v. Marathon Refining Co.</em>, 896 S.W.2d 388, 389 (Tex.App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1995, writ denied).  On the other hand, when a party merely submits a draft judgment\r\nto conform with what the court announced would be its judgment, the party does not waive\r\nhis right to complain on appeal.  <em>In re Bahn</em>, 13 S.W.3d 865, 875 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth\r\n2000, no pet.); <em>John Masek Corp. v. Davis</em>, 848 S.W.2d 170, 175 (Tex.App.--Houston [1<sup>st</sup>\r\nDist.] 1992, writ denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the record reveals that at the end of trial, the court announced it was\r\nof the belief that the estate was short of money owed to it, but did not announce any\r\nspecific award of damages at that time.  The court also did not address prejudgment\r\ninterest.  If the court did make such an announcement at a later time or if it notified the\r\nparties of its decision by letter, it does not appear in the record.  There is also no motion\r\nfor judgment in the record.  Therefore, based on the record before us, the written judgment\r\nwas the court's first rendition with respect to prejudgment interest.  The error, then, was\r\njudicial rather than clerical.  <em> See Comet Aluminum Co. v. Dibrell, </em>450 S.W.2d 56, 59 (Tex.<em>\r\n</em>1970)<em>.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>The judgment was prepared by J.T. and the court entered the judgment draft\r\nsubmitted by him.  Although J.T. could not have known the date the judge would sign the\r\njudgment, he chose to draft it so as to specify the amount of interest awarded.  Thus, J.T.\r\nreceived what he requested and has waived his right to complain on appeal.  J.T.'s fourth\r\ncross-issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifth cross-issue, J.T. complains that the trial court should have awarded him\r\nthe entire amount of attorney's fees he proved at trial.  In its judgment, the trial court\r\nawarded $98,000 in attorney's fees through trial on the merits, an additional $10,000 if the\r\njudgment was successfully defended in the court of appeals, and another $10,000 if it was\r\nsuccessfully defended in the state supreme court.  J.T.'s attorney filed an affidavit in which\r\nhe requested $147,043.27 in attorney's fees through trial, with $20,000 for a successful\r\nappeal to the court of appeals and an additional $10,000 for a successful appeal to the\r\nTexas Supreme Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs we noted above, J.T.'s request for attorney's fees is pursuant to section 114.064\r\nof the Property Code, and sections 37.009 and 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode.  The relevant portion of the Property Code relates to instances in which a trustee\r\nmay recover certain expenses for activities on its behalf.  In relevant part, the section\r\nstates, \"the court may make such award of costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's\r\nfees as may seem equitable and just.\"  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 114.064 (Vernon 1995). \r\nSimilarly, section 37.009 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that in any\r\nproceeding under the Declaratory Judgments Act, \"the court may award costs and\r\nreasonable and necessary attorney fees as are equitable and just.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.\r\nCode Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 1997).  J.T. agrees that the award of attorney's fees lies\r\nwithin the trial court's discretion.  We have previously noted that while an award of\r\nattorney's fees pursuant to section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code is\r\nmandatory if the necessary requirements are met, the amount of those fees to be awarded\r\nis discretionary.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, under any of the statutes relied on by J.T., the amount of attorney's fees\r\nawarded is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  In reviewing an award of\r\nattorney's fees, we must consider 1) the time and labor required, the novelty of the\r\nquestions presented, and the skill required to perform the legal services; 2) the likelihood\r\nthat the acceptance of the employment precluded other employment by the lawyer; 3) the\r\nfee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; 4) the amount involved\r\nand the results obtained; 5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the\r\ncircumstances; 6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; 7)\r\nthe experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services;\r\nand 8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained.  <em>Aquila Southwest\r\nPipeline, Inc. v. Harmony Exploration, Inc., </em>48 S.W.3d 225, 240-41 (Tex.App.--San Antonio\r\n2001, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the judgment, J.T. was awarded $296,990.34 and he seeks to recover almost half\r\nthat amount in attorney's fees.  There were two trials of this case and a prior appeal, the\r\nattorney's fees for which, J.T. argues, cannot be segregated.  However, J.T. was\r\nunsuccessful in a portion of the first trial which did become a final judgment.  Moreover,\r\nbased on the number of times the testimony of witnesses was compared with their\r\ntestimony in the first trial, J.T.'s attorneys were able to use testimony from the first trial with\r\nwhich they were familiar.  Considering all the factors we are required to consider, along\r\nwith the questions involved, the skill required, and the customary charges in the area, we\r\nfind no abuse of discretion in the trial court's attorney's fees award.  J.T.'s fifth cross-issue\r\nis overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixth cross-issue, J.T. posits that the trial court erred in failing to award\r\nexemplary damages.  He reasons the evidence conclusively shows that Ima willfully\r\nbreached her fiduciary duties and intentionally misrepresented material facts regarding the\r\nassets of the estate and their value.  He also argues that Barbara participated in those\r\nactivities.  We have already held that the trial court did not err in failing to award actual\r\ndamages against Barbara, and there is no need to discuss exemplary damages as to her. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides for the award of exemplary\r\ndamages:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(A) . . .[E]xemplary damages may be awarded only if the claimant proves by\r\nclear and convincing evidence that the harm with respect to which the\r\nclaimant seeks recovery of exemplary damages results from:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1) fraud;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2) malice; or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(3) wilful act or omission or gross neglect in wrongful death actions\r\nbrought by or on behalf of a surviving spouse or heirs of the decedent's\r\nbody, under a statute enacted pursuant to Section 26, Article XVI, Texas\r\nConstitution. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 41.003(a) (Vernon 1997).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court stated in its findings of fact that Ima misrepresented the value of the\r\nestate to J.T., she intended J.T. to rely on her misrepresentations about the value of the\r\nestate, he actually relied on her misrepresentations, he did not have actual knowledge of\r\nthe true value of the estate, and he suffered damages proximately caused by those\r\nmisrepresentations.  The trial court further found that Ima's actions in misapplying and\r\nconverting estate property, failure to make full disclosure, her misrepresentations about\r\nthe value of the estate, and her failure to account constituted gross misconduct and gross\r\nmismanagement in the performance of her duties as executrix.  Thus, assuming the\r\nevidence was sufficient to support those findings, the trial court could have awarded\r\nexemplary damages.  The question, then, becomes whether the trial court was required\r\nto award exemplary damages in this situation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe statute itself does not state that exemplary damages must be awarded if fraud\r\nor malice is found, and J.T. has cited no authority that states that proposition.  Punitive\r\ndamages are only proper in exceptional cases.  <em>C &amp; D Robotics, Inc. v. Mann</em>, 47 S.W.3d\r\n194, 201 (Tex.App.--Texarkana 2001, no pet.).  The factfinder may assess punitive\r\ndamages to deter future misconduct, punish wrongdoers, and reimburse the plaintiff for\r\nremote losses.  <em>Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. v. Lieck</em>, 845 S.W.2d 926, 946 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1992), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 881 S.W.2d 288 (Tex. 1994).  The\r\nwrongdoer in this instance is an elderly woman, which, as the trial court noted, by her own\r\nadmission is no longer able to fulfill the role of executrix of the estate, at least in part,\r\nbecause of failing eyesight.  The will also gave Ima the right to use the corpus for her own\r\nwelfare, support, and maintenance in the manner to which she was accustomed.  She\r\nnever used that option.  Additionally, there was evidence that Ima and J.T. had long had\r\ndealings with one another, including J.T.'s requests for loans from the estate to resolve his\r\nown bankruptcy problems, and some of those dealings had resulted in litigation by J.T. in\r\nwhich no liability on Ima's part was determined.  In view of all of this, the trial court could\r\nhave determined there was no need to assess exemplary damages to deter future\r\nmisconduct inasmuch as Ima would no longer be in a position to commit those same acts. \r\nIt could also have determined that J.T. had not suffered any remote losses.  J.T.'s sixth\r\ncross-issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn summary, because we have found no reversible error, all issues presented by\r\nboth parties are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn T.

McAdams, deceased, brings this appeal from a judgment against her in a\r\nlawsuit brought by her son J.Y. Jr. McAdams (J.T.) or his wife Annie McAdams (Annie) for\r\ndamages resulting from a breach of her fiduciary duty as executrix of the estate.  Although\r\nthe parties are familiar with the somewhat complicated procedural and factual background,\r\nwe will recite it in the detail necessary to a proper discussion of the issues presented for\r\nour decision.  For reasons we later express, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.Y. McAdams died in 1974 survived by his wife Ima, and the couple's four children,\r\nJ.T., Coretha Brown,<sup> (1)</sup></span><span> Barbara Billups (Barbara) and Margaret Ward.  He left a will in which\r\nIma was appointed as independent executrix of his estate.  In his will, he stated that all of\r\nhis property was community. He bequeathed his wife a life estate in his community one-half interest with remainder over to his children, share and share alike.  In pertinent part,\r\nthe will also provided:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tThe said Ima L. McAdams shall have the use, benefit, and enjoyment\r\nof said property during her natural life and shall also have the right and\r\npower to use or invade the body of my estate to whatever extent as may be\r\nnecessary to provide for her welfare, support and maintenance in the\r\nmanner to which she is accustomed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\tDuring the existence of my said wife's life estate she shall also have\r\nfull power and authority to change the form of any or all of the corpus of my\r\nestate by sales, exchanges, encumbrances, investments, purchases or other\r\ndespositions [sic] or acquisitions, to the extent deemed advisable by my said\r\nwife in her discretion, all without being liable for any loss incurred in her\r\nexercise of such discretion in good faith.  In connection with her exercise of\r\nany such powers, any other party dealing with her shall receive as good a\r\ntitle to anything transferred by my said wife as if my said wife had been the\r\nfee simple owner thereof, and such other party shall not be required to follow\r\nor inquire into the application or disposition of the consideration paid by such\r\nother party.  However, by proper accounting or otherwise, my said wife shall\r\nsegregate or maintain the separate identity of the corpus of my estate,\r\nregardless of whether such corpus remains in its original form or is\r\nconverted to some other form by her exercise of any of the powers\r\nhereinabove granted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>At trial, Ima testified that she never took any funds from the corpus of the estate to pay for\r\nher welfare, support, or maintenance.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the underlying suit, J.T. and Annie originally sued Ima and Barbara concerning\r\na dispute over a McAdams farm partnership and a claimed breach of fiduciary duty, fraud,\r\nand conspiracy with respect to Ima's administration of the estate.  At trial, the court\r\nrendered a take-nothing judgment, which was appealed to this court.  In the course of\r\ndisposing of that appeal, we reversed and remanded that portion of the trial court judgment\r\ndecreeing that J.T. take nothing on his claims against Ima and Barbara arising from the\r\ndistribution of the estate of J.Y. McAdams.  This appeal results from the retrial of that\r\nportion of the suit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the judgment giving rise to this appeal, the trial court held that J.T. should recover\r\ndamages based upon a fraudulent inducement to sign a release of claims arising from the\r\ndistribution of the estate.  It held that J.T. was entitled to recover damages of $235,083 as\r\nhis 25% share of the $940,332 the court found resulted from a diversion of funds by Ima\r\nfrom the corpus of the estate.  The trial court further decreed that J.T. take nothing against\r\nBarbara, that Ima be removed as executrix of the estate, and awarded attorney fees and\r\nprejudgment interest.  The trial court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in\r\nsupport of its judgment.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt issue are several transactions that occurred during the administration of the\r\nestate.<sup> (2)</sup></span><span>  These include 1) a loan of $501,000 made to J.T. by the estate and Ima, 2) a sale\r\nof some property by the estate to Barbara for $47,000, 3) the purchase of the Keyes Farm\r\nin Oklahoma by Ima, J.T., and Annie, with the estate contributing part of the money for the\r\npurchase, and the subsequent sale of the same property, and 4) a loan given by the estate\r\nfor the purchase of an elevator on the Bohlender property.  After those transactions, Ima\r\noffered to make a cash distribution to the remaindermen in exchange for a release of all\r\nclaims or liabilities against her.  In doing so, she represented the value of the corpus of the\r\nestate to be $471,513.19, and J.T. subsequently received $117,878.29, which was one-fourth of the $471,513.19 figure.  When he filed his suit, J.T. averred that the corpus of the\r\nestate was actually much greater than that amount. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn pursuing her appeal, Ima presents 12 issues for our decision.  In the first eight\r\nof her issues, she challenges the legal and factual sufficiency of the trial court's findings\r\nthat 1) $84,000 was diverted from the proceeds of a $501,000 loan made by the estate to\r\nJ.T. and Annie, 2) $60,000 was diverted from the proceeds of a Bohlender elevator note,\r\n3) $623,333 was diverted from the repayment of the loans made to obtain the Keyes Farm,\r\nand 4) $172,990 in lost profits to the estate occurred as a result of the sale of the Keyes\r\nFarm.  In her four remaining issues, Ima asks if 9) by electing to confirm the release,\r\nconveyance, and consent to distribution, J.T. has waived his standing to seek Ima's\r\nremoval as executrix of the estate, 10) J.T. is entitled to keep the funds paid him under the\r\nconveyance, release, and consent to distribution and at the same time rescind the\r\nagreement, 11) the award of attorney fees is mandatory, and 12) she, Ima, is entitled to\r\na $25,000 offset to the judgment together with interest as the result of another judgment\r\nshe had recovered against J.T. and Annie.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs cross-appellant, J.T. asks if 1) the record conclusively shows that Ima caused\r\ndamage to the estate of J.Y. McAdams in excess of the damages found by the court in its\r\njudgment with respect to the diversion of proceeds, or 2) alternatively, whether the trial\r\ncourt's finding as to the amount of those damages is against the great weight of the\r\nevidence, 3) the trial court improperly failed to award damages against Barbara for\r\nconspiracy in the sale of land to her because the record conclusively demonstrates\r\notherwise or because the trial court's finding otherwise is against the great weight of the\r\nevidence, 4) the trial court improperly calculated the amount of prejudgment interest, 5)\r\nthe trial court abused its discretion in failing to award the entire amount of attorney's fees\r\nproved at trial, and 6) the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award exemplary\r\ndamages.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a no-evidence issue, we consider the evidence and reasonable\r\ninferences from that evidence which, viewed in their most favorable light, support the trial\r\ncourt findings, disregarding all evidence and inferences to the contrary.  <em>Lewelling v.\r\nLewelling</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456505\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456505/lewelling-v-lewelling/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 166 (Tex. 1990).  If more than a scintilla of evidence supports\r\nthe finding, the no-evidence challenge fails.  <em>Id</em>.  In reviewing a factual insufficiency\r\nchallenge, we review all the evidence and reverse only if the challenged finding is so\r\nagainst the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be manifestly unjust. \r\n<em>In re King's Estate</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1670188\"><a href=\"/opinion/1670188/in-re-kings-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 661 (1951).  The trier of fact is the sole\r\njudge of the credibility and the weight to be given to the testimony of the witnesses.  <em>See\r\nMcGalliard v. Kuhlmann</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2362457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2362457/mcgalliard-v-kuhlmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span>, 697 (Tex. 1986).  Because both parties question\r\nthe sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's award of damages with respect\r\nto the specific transactions enumerated, we will address each of those transactions\r\nseparately. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn Ima's first two issues, the subject transaction is a $501,000 loan made in 1988\r\nto effect a bankruptcy settlement.  In its findings of fact with regard to this loan, the trial\r\ncourt found \"Ima diverted to her own use and benefit $84,000.00 by taking the funds repaid\r\nto the Estate.\"  Ima denies there was any diversion of this money, while J.T. claims that the\r\nentire amount was diverted.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.T. and Annie executed a $501,000 note to Ima as executrix, which was secured\r\nby a deed of trust on land in Dallam County.  The note was eventually paid and the deed\r\nof trust released on December 14, 1995. With regard to the diversion, J.T. points to Ima's\r\ntestimony that at the time she calculated the corpus of the estate prior to distribution, she\r\ndid not include as an asset any credit for the $501,000 note balance.  The history of\r\npayments made on the note is confusing.  Ima also testified that at the time of this loan,\r\nshe did not have $501,000 in the estate, so she borrowed some money on certificates of\r\ndeposit owned by the estate.  Later, $430,000 (apparently the proceeds of the sale of\r\nsome cattle by J.T.) was wire transferred to Ima's personal account.  Both Ima and J.T.\r\ndenied giving instructions that this money be wired to Ima's personal account.  With the\r\nmoney, Ima averred that she bought certificates of deposit totaling $350,000 in the name\r\nof the estate, and the remainder of $80,000 she applied to a $275,000 debt J.T. owed her\r\npersonally.  J.T. also gave Ima a check for $100,000 made out to her individually, which,\r\nshe said, was applied to the estate corpus. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t However, Jordan Mills, an accountant who testified for J.T., reviewed the bank\r\nrecords and ledger accounts kept by Ima, and averred that out of payments made on the\r\n$501,000 note, he could only find that $100,000 was paid to the estate.  He also said that\r\nalthough the note called for 9% interest, he was never able to compute exactly what\r\ninterest may have been paid on the note.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, the evidence is disputed as to how much of the $501,000 loan was actually\r\nrepaid to the estate.  From the record, we are unable to tell exactly how the trial court\r\narrived at the figure of $84,000 as the amount of the repayments Ima diverted, and neither\r\nparty has offered an explanation of that computation.  Even so, that amount is within the\r\nvariation of the disputed testimony at trial.  There is also the evidence that Ima took\r\n$80,000 from the funds repaid by J.T. and credited it to a personal loan made by her to\r\nJ.T.  Considering this with the other evidence, the trial court could have rationally arrived\r\nat the $84,000 figure.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNevertheless, J.T. contends the amount of money actually repaid to the estate is\r\nirrelevant because it is undisputed that Ima did not include the proceeds of the $501,000\r\nnote in the corpus of the estate used to compute the distribution.  However, there was\r\ntestimony that the estate did not have $501,000 at the time the loan was made and that\r\nIma borrowed the money, using as collateral certificates of deposit owned by the estate. \r\nThus, if that testimony was accepted by the factfinder, it supports an inference that the\r\n$501,000 was not originally in the corpus of the estate but was borrowed, was then\r\neventually paid back to the lender, and therefore should not have been included in the\r\ncorpus as J.T. contends.  Ima's first two issues are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn considering Ima's third and fourth issues, we must consider whether the trial court\r\nwas incorrect in awarding $60,000 in damages for funds diverted from the Bohlender\r\nelevator note proceeds.  Parenthetically, J.T. does not challenge this award.  In 1985, the\r\nestate and Ima loaned $60,000 each to the Bohlenders to build a grain elevator on land\r\npurchased from the estate.  To secure that amount, the Bohlenders executed a note in that\r\namount secured by a deed of trust.  The note was repaid and Ima testified that although\r\nshe did not give a special credit for the estate's $60,000 in calculating the estate's value,\r\nit was already included in the corpus of the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIma also testified that when she received repayments on money the estate had\r\nloaned, she deposited both principal and interest into the same bank account, although\r\nshe attempted to keep separate records herself as to what constituted principal and\r\ninterest.  There were no estate records per se to show whether repayments of money it\r\nloaned was corpus of the estate or was interest.  At trial, the court found that Ima had\r\ndiverted to her own use $60,000 that belonged to the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.T. argues that it was Ima's burden to show that the estate's money was returned\r\nto the estate because she had admitted that she commingled her individual and estate\r\nfunds.  Ima argues there was no proof that she improperly retained the estate's money and\r\nthe trial court erred in finding to the contrary.  In that connection, viewed in the light by\r\nwhich we must view it, the evidence is both legally and factually sufficient to support the\r\ntrial court's resolution of this question.  In that regard, the evidence clearly shows that\r\ncontrary to the instructions in the will, with respect to money loaned by the estate, Ima\r\ncommingled the interest and corpus of repayments made on the loan.  Although Ima\r\nasserts that the $60,000 was included in the corpus of the estate for distribution, the\r\nrecord does not show she was able to trace those repayments to show their inclusion in\r\nthat corpus.  <em>See Eaton v. Husted</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3945221\"><a href=\"/opinion/4177179/eaton-v-husted/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3945221\"><a href=\"/opinion/4177179/eaton-v-husted/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>, 498-99 (1943).  Ima's\r\nthird and fourth issues are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn determining Ima's fifth and sixth issues, we must examine the purchase of the\r\nKeyes Farm.  With respect to that transaction, the trial court found that Ima had diverted\r\nto her use and benefit $623,333 that belonged to the estate.  In 1989, J.T. and Ima\r\npurchased a farm near Keyes, Oklahoma, for $1,100,000.  Although J.T. and Annie\r\nreceived a 2/3 interest in the farm with Ima receiving the other 1/3 interest, all of the money\r\ncame from Ima and the estate.  To finance the purchase, ostensibly J.T. borrowed\r\n$366,666.66 from the estate and the same amount from Ima individually.  However, Ima's\r\nledger sheets show, and she admitted, that the estate actually contributed 85%, or\r\n$623,333.05 of the money loaned to J.T.  Ima did not say whether the remainder of the\r\nmoney advanced came from estate funds or her separate funds.  She admitted that if the\r\nmoney was repaid, the estate corpus would receive only $366,666.66, which was less than\r\nactually came from estate funds.  Ima admitted that she did not give any credit for the\r\nestate's contribution to the purchase price when she calculated the amount for distribution\r\nof the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIma testified that although J.T. paid some interest on the notes executed by him, no\r\nprincipal was ever paid.  The farm was sold in 1994 for approximately $2,000,000.  Of the\r\nprofit, two-thirds went to J.T. and one-third to Ima.  The loans against the property were\r\npaid off at the time of the sale.  Both Ima and J.T. directed the title company in writing to\r\ndistribute the remainder of the sale proceeds after the liens were paid, with $594,473\r\ngoing to J.T. and Annie and $663,904.02 going to Ima.  Of the approximately $1,397,000\r\nthat she received from the sale, including the repayment of the loans and the portion of the\r\nremainder paid to her, Ima did not return any of those funds to the estate, but placed them\r\nin a certificate of deposit in her own name. The evidence is therefore both legally and\r\nfactually sufficient to support the trial court's finding that she diverted $623,333 from the\r\nestate.  Ima's fifth and sixth issues are overruled. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe note J.T.'s first cross-issue contention that the evidence actually supports an\r\naward to him of $920,318.64 with respect to the loans made in connection with the\r\npurchase of the Keyes Farm.  This is so, he argues, because the evidence is\r\nuncontroverted that the estate contributed more than $623,333 to its purchase.  Jordan\r\nMills testified that Ima kept a lot of the estate money in certificates of deposit in the estate's\r\nname.  In trying to determine where the money for the purchase of the farm came from,\r\nMills looked at bank statements, checks, and deposit slips.  He claimed to have been able\r\nto trace the amount of estate money used to purchase the farm to an amount of\r\n$920,318.04 based on a ledger sheet used by Ima showing various bank deposits which\r\nwere gathered to make up the purchase price of the farm.  Further, because the total price\r\nwas $1,101,476 and $920,318.64 is 83.55% of that amount and, because he saw some\r\nmargin notations on Ima's balance sheets showing 85% attributable to the estate and 15%\r\nattributable to J.T., Mills believed his figure was correct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThus, there was conflicting testimony from Ima and Mills as to the amount of funds\r\ncontributed by the estate to the purchase of the Keyes Farm with Ima testifying that the\r\nestate only contributed 85% of the money loaned to J.T. while he contends, supported by\r\nMills's testimony, the correct amount was 85% of the total purchase price.  Because it was\r\nwithin the trial court's special prerogative as the trier of fact to resolve factual disputes, we\r\nwill not disturb the trial court finding.  Ima's seventh issue is overruled. \t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe $172,999 included in the trial court's findings as the estate's lost profit on the\r\nKeyes Farm transaction is the subject of Ima's seventh and eighth issues.  While she\r\ncontends the evidence does not support that inclusion, J.T. contends the amount of profit\r\nattributable to the estate was actually $297,236.78.  The parties agree that the farm was\r\npurchased for $1,100,000 and sold for $2,000,000.  Therefore, the profit on the sale was\r\napproximately $900,000.  The parties also agree that Ima was entitled to one-third of the\r\nprofit or approximately $300,000.  If the estate contributed $623,333.05 to the purchase\r\nprice of the farm, as the trial court apparently found, that contribution amounted to about\r\n57% of the purchase price.  The same percentage of Ima's share of the profit is\r\napproximately $171,000.  Although that figure is not the exact amount of the lost profit\r\nfound by the court, it is sufficiently close to sustain the trial court's findings.  Additionally,\r\nas we have noted, Ima admitted she had deposited all the proceeds from the sale received\r\nby her into a certificate of deposit in her name.  Ima's seventh and eighth issues are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her ninth issue, Ima argues that by electing to confirm the release, conveyance\r\nand consent to distribution, J.T. waived any right to seek her removal as executrix of the\r\nestate.  She bases that position on the argument that once J.T. elected to take his share\r\nof the distribution, he had no further interest in the estate and therefore had no standing\r\nto challenge Ima's position as the independent executrix of the estate.  In response, J.T.\r\ncontends that, although the argument might have had merit if the estate had been worth\r\nwhat Ima represented, because the trial court found it was worth much more than she had\r\nrepresented, he has not waived his right to seek her removal.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t The trial court found as a matter of fact that Ima misapplied and converted estate\r\nproperty, failed to make a full disclosure, misrepresented the value of the estate, and failed\r\nto account, all of which constituted gross misconduct and gross mismanagement in the\r\nperformance of her duties, which constituted cause for her removal.  Thus, the trial court\r\nconcluded, Ima had breached her fiduciary duty and should be removed as executrix.  The\r\ntrial court further concluded that J.T. was not barred \"from seeking relief despite not\r\nactually returning consideration received under the release because he satisfied his\r\n'tender' obligation, and because he has a meritorious claim for compensation in excess of\r\nthat consideration.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe existence of standing is a question of law.  <em>A &amp; W Industries, Inc. v. Day</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1799322\"><a href=\"/opinion/1799322/a-w-industries-inc-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span>, 741 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth 1998, no pet.).  For a person to maintain a suit,\r\nhe must have standing to litigate the matters at issue.  Generally, that means some interest\r\npeculiar to him individually and not as a member of the general public.  <em>Id.  </em>Ima does not\r\ncontest that J.T. would have had standing to seek her removal but, as we noted above, she\r\nargues that he has waived that right.  The essence of the trial court findings was that Ima\r\nmisrepresented the value of the estate, she intended J.T. to rely on her representations,\r\nhe did to his detriment, and that he was entitled to damages above the amount of money\r\nhe originally obtained and for which he executed his release.  The trial court's findings are\r\nsufficiently supported by the record.  Because of these findings, J.T. has not waived his\r\nright to seek Ima's removal, even though he never rescinded his release.  Damages and\r\nrescission are not mutually exclusive remedies when both are needed to give complete\r\nrelief to the complaining party.  <em>See LaChalet International, Inc. v. Nowik</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1639219\"><a href=\"/opinion/1639219/lachalet-intern-inc-v-nowik/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>,\r\n104 (Tex.App.--Dallas 1990, no writ).  The record does not show that the estate\r\nadministration has ever been officially closed.  That being so, in order to accord J.T.\r\ncomplete relief, it was proper both to remove Ima as executrix and to allow J.T. to recover\r\nhis share of the additional value of the estate above that which he had already received. \r\nIma's ninth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMuch of our discussion above is applicable to Ima's tenth issue, in which she\r\nasserts that because J.T. elected to waive rescission of his previous release agreement,\r\nhe is bound by the sums he received under that agreement and is not entitled to receive\r\nanything above what he has already received.  However, as we have stated, a party is not\r\nnecessarily required to choose between rescission and damages when a party has been\r\nfraudulently induced to enter into a contract.  Further, as we noted in our previous opinion\r\non this matter, before J.T.'s acceptance of a benefit can create an estoppel, it must be\r\nshown that the benefit was accepted with knowledge of all material facts.  <em>Frazier v. Wynn</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1711947\"><a href=\"/opinion/1711947/frazier-v-wynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span>, 753 (Tex. 1971).  Additionally, J.T. had agreed to accept a one-fourth\r\ndistribution of the estate.  Even if that agreement was not rescinded, it does not mean that\r\nhe would not be entitled to receive a one-quarter distribution based on the true value of\r\nthe estate as opposed to the represented value.  Ima's tenth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her eleventh issue, Ima posits that J.T. is not entitled to receive attorney's fees\r\nbecause there is no evidence that presentment of his claim was made as required by\r\nsection 38.002 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, and a party may not recover\r\nattorney's fees for rescission of a contract.  In responding, J.T. argues that he not only\r\nsought recovery of attorney's fees under section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode, but he also sought recovery of those fees under the Property Code and the\r\nDeclaratory Judgments Act (section 37.009 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code). \r\nThose rights of recovery, he posits, have not been challenged by Ima.  In any event, he\r\ncontends, there is sufficient evidence of presentment made in his attorney's affidavit on\r\nthe subject of fees.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tUnder section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, a person may\r\nrecover reasonable attorney's fees if the claim is on an oral or written contract.  Tex. Civ.\r\nPrac &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 38.001 (Vernon 1997).  To recover under that section, the\r\nclaimant must present the claim to the opposing party and payment for the just amount\r\nowed must not have been tendered by the opposing party before expiration of the 30<sup>th</sup> day\r\nafter presentation of the claim.  <em>Id. </em>§ 38.002.

Ima's eleventh issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn her twelfth and final issue, Ima claims she is entitled to a $25,000 offset against\r\nthe judgment for the amount of the attorney's fees she was awarded against J.T. in the\r\nprior trial of this cause.  She also claims an offset for $117,878.29, the amount she had\r\nalready distributed to J.T., together with 10% interest per annum from the date of the\r\ndistribution.  We note that the trial court has only entered judgment for the additional sums\r\nthat should have been included in the value of the estate.  Thus, the court has not awarded\r\nJ.T. any double recovery in that regard.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWith regard to the offset for the $25,000 attorney fees, J.T. argues that because\r\nIma did not request such an offset from the trial court, she has waived the right to make\r\nthat claim on appeal.  Ima neither cites any authority that she is now entitled to such an\r\noffset, nor does she point out in the record where she made such a request.  However, in\r\nmaking our own review of the record, we find that she did make such a request, in addition\r\nto other requested offsets, in her first supplemental answer.  However, Ima does not cite\r\nany portions of the record in which she called that particular request to the attention of the\r\ntrial court.  Our perusal of the record reveals that the only portions of the prior judgment\r\nIma asked the trial court to take judicial notice of was with respect to two tractors and a\r\nplow, for which she was asking compensation.  Also, she did not raise that question in her\r\nmotion for new trial.  To preserve a complaint for appellate review, the record must show\r\nit was made to the trial court by a timely request, objection, or motion that stated with\r\nsufficient specificity the grounds for the ruling sought so that the trial court might be made\r\naware of the complaint.  Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a)(1)(A).  By failing to meet that requirement,\r\nIma has failed to preserve that complaint for our review.  Ima's twelfth issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe have already addressed the basis for J.T.'s first cross-issue with respect to the\r\nlegal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court's awards with regard\r\nto the $501,000 loan, the Keyes Farm transaction, and the Bohlender elevator note in\r\ndiscussing Ima's contentions in that regard.  We will not, therefore, address those matters\r\nagain.  However, because we have not addressed the legal and factual sufficiency of the\r\nevidence with regard to the Billups land transaction, and because it is raised by J.T. in that\r\nissue, we will discuss that question.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn reviewing a legal sufficiency challenge on an issue upon which the complaining\r\nparty had the burden of proof, we examine the record to determine if there is any evidence\r\nto support the finding while ignoring all evidence to the contrary and, if there is no\r\nevidence to support the finding, we must see if the contrary proposition had been\r\nestablished as a matter of law.  <em>Holley v.

As\r\nalready stated, a factual sufficiency challenge requires us to review the record for some\r\nprobative evidence to support the finding and determine if, in light of all the evidence, the\r\nfinding is not manifestly unjust.  <em>Traylor v.

Barbara executed a $47,000 note payable to Ima as\r\nthe executrix of the estate, which was secured by a deed of trust on the property.  On\r\nNovember 30, 1995, Ima, as executrix, transferred the note and the liens securing it to\r\nherself.  She then released the note and liens on October 29, 1996.  In advancing his\r\nchallenge, J.T. contends that no payment was made to the estate for this transfer and,\r\nbecause of this, the value of the estate prior to the distribution should have been increased\r\nby that amount.  The trial court did not make any award with respect to this transaction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIma testified that she could not produce a check for a $47,000 payment from her to\r\nthe estate or a deposit slip showing a deposit of any such amount to the estate.  She also\r\nadmitted that Barbara paid her individually the $47,000 and that she deposited the money\r\nin her individual account.  She further admitted that in calculating the value of the estate\r\nprior to her distribution, she did not add a separate credit for the $47,000, but that that\r\namount was already included in her computation of the corpus of the estate.  At the time\r\nthe estate was distributed in 1996, she had not yet been paid by Barbara.  Therefore, she\r\naverred, she had put her own money in the estate and, when Barbara paid her after\r\nBarbara had received her share of the distribution, she was entitled to put the money in\r\nher own individual account.  The trial court, in its capacity as factfinder, was entitled to\r\naccept Ima's testimony and, if accepted, as it obviously was, it is both legally and factually\r\nsufficient to uphold the trial court's refusal to award damages in that respect.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tJ.T. also contends that he should have been awarded $28,000 of the profit resulting\r\nfrom the sale of the estate's undivided one-half interest in the land to Barbara.  His\r\nargument is based on the proposition that Ima sold the land to Barbara for less than its fair\r\nmarket value.  The 960 acres was included in the inventory of the estate property at a\r\nvalue of $100 per acre or a total of $96,000.  Both Barbara and Ima said the undivided\r\ninterest in the land was sold to Barbara for $100 per acre based on its inventory value in\r\n1974.  No current appraisal of the land was made at the time of its sale, but neighboring\r\nland sold at $150 per acre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBoth parties presented expert testimony about the value of the land.  Steve Rogers,\r\na real estate appraiser, was called by J.T.  Rogers testified that based on information he\r\nhad gathered about comparable land sales, he estimated the value of the land on February\r\n17, 1995, at $185 per acre.  To arrive at the value of the undivided one-half interest, he\r\napplied a discount factor of 15% to 20% because a half interest is not marketed easily. \r\nBy his calculations, the interest in the land would have been worth $75,000 at the time of\r\nits sale.  However, he admitted he had never actually been on the land and had only seen\r\nit from the road.  He initially had not used the neighboring land, which had sold in his\r\ncalculations, but later went back and took it into consideration.  However, he did not\r\nchange his opinion because he felt the sale of the land was supportive of his valuation,\r\neven though it sold for substantially less than other properties he had used.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppraiser Leslie Dodson testified for Ima.  He also used the sale comparison\r\napproach in arriving at his valuation of the land in 1995.  He valued the estate's one-half\r\ninterest at $47,500 based on a value of $150 per acre with a 33 1/3% discount factor.  He\r\naverred he had used this formula before and it was an accepted method.  He had actually\r\nbeen on the land and said it was important to do so in order to know about potential water\r\nproduction on the property and its topography.  Even though it was substantially similar,\r\nhe admitted he valued the land across the road at $168 per acre.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAgain, the trial court had conflicting appraisals before it.  As the factfinder, it was\r\nwell within its power to judge the credibility of the experts and the evidentiary weight to be\r\ngiven their opinion.  We cannot fault its resolution of the conflict and find no error in its\r\nrefusal to award the damages suggested by J.T.  The first two cross-issues of J.T. are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his third cross-issue, J.T. contests the trial court's refusal to award him damages\r\nagainst Barbara for conspiracy in regard to the Billups land transaction because, he\r\nreasons, the record conclusively establishes such a conspiracy or, in the alternative, the\r\ntrial court's refusal to find such a conspiracy was against the great weight of the evidence. \r\nJ.T. argues that the evidence shows Ima and Barbara acted together to transfer the\r\nestate's interest in the land for less than its fair market value and to divert money away\r\nfrom the estate, and that they failed to disclose those facts to him.  Because of their\r\nactions, he reasons, Ima and Barbara are jointly and severally liable for the value of the\r\nland which they diverted from the estate.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe essential elements of a conspiracy are 1) two or more persons, 2) an object to\r\nbe accomplished, 3) a meeting of minds on the object or course of action, 4) one or more\r\nunlawful, overt acts, and 5) damages as the proximate result.  <em>Massey v. Armco Steel Co.</em>,\r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1772324\"><a href=\"/opinion/1772324/massey-v-armco-steel-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 934 (Tex. 1983).  Ima denied that she ever talked to Barbara about\r\nattempting to defeat the estate's interest in the land.  Further, she did not remember \r\nwhether Barbara objected to the $47,000 sale price, and she had no conversation with\r\nBarbara other than to tell her she would sell her the land.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBarbara averred that she was told the purchase price for the property would be\r\n$47,000, she did not seek an appraisal of the property and, she admitted, she did not tell\r\nJ.T. about the purchase of the property.  Although in her earlier testimony Barbara stated \r\nshe had known the property across the road sold for $150 per acre at the time she made\r\nthe purchase, at this trial, she denied that was the case.  Barbara also admitted that she\r\ndid not make a down payment on the land and that she never made any payments on the\r\nland to the estate.  Barbara additionally said that Ima told her the estate would be\r\ndistributed and Barbara could give a check in payment of the purchase loan at that time. \r\nIma had also told her that she, Ima, was going to buy the note from the estate.  Barbara \r\naverred that she and her sister Margaret prepared a summary of the estate banking\r\ntransactions after J.T.'s lawsuit was filed.  She did not remember what amounts she saw\r\nrecorded in that summary, but in her prior testimony, she had agreed that she did not see\r\nthe $47,000 payment recorded.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAfter reviewing the evidence, we conclude that J.T. has failed to conclusively\r\nestablish that Ima and Barbara entered into a conspiracy and the trial court's failure to find\r\nsuch a conspiracy was not against the great weight of the evidence.  The testimony in the\r\nrecord shows that Ima told Barbara the estate would sell her the property and what the\r\nprice would be.  The fact that Barbara did not challenge the sale price and, even though\r\nshe may have known nearby land sold for more money, that she did not have an\r\nindependent appraisal made is not necessarily evidence that she conspired to defraud the\r\nestate.  The evidence also showed that Barbara did not know until after J.T.'s lawsuit was\r\nfiled that the estate might not have received any money for the land.  The resolution of\r\ninconsistencies in the evidence was within the trial court's power as the factfinder to\r\nresolve, and we do not find it reversibly erred in declining to award conspiracy damages\r\nagainst Barbara.  J.T.'s third cross-issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fourth cross-issue, J.T. challenges the amount of prejudgment interest\r\nawarded him.  The gist of his complaint is that the interest awarded was based on the time\r\nperiod from November 16, 1996, to April 6, 2001, even though the judgment was not\r\nsigned until May 25, 2001.  That being so, J.T. claims his entitlement to additional interest\r\nfor the period from April 6, 2001, to May 25, 2001.  Although the record shows that J.T.\r\nfiled a motion to modify the judgment to correct the amount of interest awarded, there is\r\nnothing in the record showing the trial court ever ruled on it.  Ima does not contest that J.T.\r\nwould ordinarily be entitled to prejudgment interest to the date of judgment but, she claims,\r\nJ.T. is not entitled to any additional prejudgment interest because he drafted the judgment,\r\nincluding the calculation of prejudgment interest.  Thus, he got what he requested, she\r\nasserts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe judgment itself recites that the plaintiff is awarded 6% prejudgment interest from\r\nNovember 16, 1996, \"to the date of this Judgment, in the amount of $38.64378 per day.\"\r\nThe judgment further states, \"[a]s of the date of this Judgment, the total prejudgment\r\ninterest is $61,907.34 . . . .\"  When a party moves for judgment and judgment is entered\r\nin accordance with the motion, the party waives the right to complain of the judgment on\r\nappeal.  <em>Casu v.

On the other hand, when a party merely submits a draft judgment\r\nto conform with what the court announced would be its judgment, the party does not waive\r\nhis right to complain on appeal.  <em>In re Bahn</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2105295\"><a href=\"/opinion/2105295/in-re-bahn/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 875 (Tex.App.--Fort Worth\r\n2000, no pet.); <em>John Masek Corp. v.

The court also did not address prejudgment\r\ninterest.  If the court did make such an announcement at a later time or if it notified the\r\nparties of its decision by letter, it does not appear in the record.  There is also no motion\r\nfor judgment in the record.  Therefore, based on the record before us, the written judgment\r\nwas the court's first rendition with respect to prejudgment interest.  The error, then, was\r\njudicial rather than clerical.  <em> See Comet Aluminum Co. v. Dibrell, </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1567953\"><a href=\"/opinion/1567953/comet-aluminum-company-v-dibrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 59 (Tex.<em>\r\n</em>1970)<em>.</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>The judgment was prepared by J.T. and the court entered the judgment draft\r\nsubmitted by him.  Although J.T. could not have known the date the judge would sign the\r\njudgment, he chose to draft it so as to specify the amount of interest awarded.  Thus, J.T.\r\nreceived what he requested and has waived his right to complain on appeal.  J.T.'s fourth\r\ncross-issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his fifth cross-issue, J.T. complains that the trial court should have awarded him\r\nthe entire amount of attorney's fees he proved at trial.  In its judgment, the trial court\r\nawarded $98,000 in attorney's fees through trial on the merits, an additional $10,000 if the\r\njudgment was successfully defended in the court of appeals, and another $10,000 if it was\r\nsuccessfully defended in the state supreme court.  J.T.'s attorney filed an affidavit in which\r\nhe requested $147,043.27 in attorney's fees through trial, with $20,000 for a successful\r\nappeal to the court of appeals and an additional $10,000 for a successful appeal to the\r\nTexas Supreme Court.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAs we noted above, J.T.'s request for attorney's fees is pursuant to section 114.064\r\nof the Property Code, and sections 37.009 and 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies\r\nCode.  The relevant portion of the Property Code relates to instances in which a trustee\r\nmay recover certain expenses for activities on its behalf.  In relevant part, the section\r\nstates, \"the court may make such award of costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's\r\nfees as may seem equitable and just.\"  Tex. Prop. Code Ann. § 114.064 (Vernon 1995). \r\nSimilarly, section 37.009 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides that in any\r\nproceeding under the Declaratory Judgments Act, \"the court may award costs and\r\nreasonable and necessary attorney fees as are equitable and just.\"  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.\r\nCode Ann. § 37.009 (Vernon 1997).  J.T. agrees that the award of attorney's fees lies\r\nwithin the trial court's discretion.  We have previously noted that while an award of\r\nattorney's fees pursuant to section 38.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code is\r\nmandatory if the necessary requirements are met, the amount of those fees to be awarded\r\nis discretionary.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTherefore, under any of the statutes relied on by J.T., the amount of attorney's fees\r\nawarded is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.  In reviewing an award of\r\nattorney's fees, we must consider 1) the time and labor required, the novelty of the\r\nquestions presented, and the skill required to perform the legal services; 2) the likelihood\r\nthat the acceptance of the employment precluded other employment by the lawyer; 3) the\r\nfee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; 4) the amount involved\r\nand the results obtained; 5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the\r\ncircumstances; 6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; 7)\r\nthe experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services;\r\nand 8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained.  <em>Aquila Southwest\r\nPipeline, Inc. v.

There were two trials of this case and a prior appeal, the\r\nattorney's fees for which, J.T. argues, cannot be segregated.  However, J.T. was\r\nunsuccessful in a portion of the first trial which did become a final judgment.  Moreover,\r\nbased on the number of times the testimony of witnesses was compared with their\r\ntestimony in the first trial, J.T.'s attorneys were able to use testimony from the first trial with\r\nwhich they were familiar.  Considering all the factors we are required to consider, along\r\nwith the questions involved, the skill required, and the customary charges in the area, we\r\nfind no abuse of discretion in the trial court's attorney's fees award.  J.T.'s fifth cross-issue\r\nis overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn his sixth cross-issue, J.T. posits that the trial court erred in failing to award\r\nexemplary damages.  He reasons the evidence conclusively shows that Ima willfully\r\nbreached her fiduciary duties and intentionally misrepresented material facts regarding the\r\nassets of the estate and their value.  He also argues that Barbara participated in those\r\nactivities.  We have already held that the trial court did not err in failing to award actual\r\ndamages against Barbara, and there is no need to discuss exemplary damages as to her. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Civil Practice and Remedies Code provides for the award of exemplary\r\ndamages:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t(A) . . .[E]xemplary damages may be awarded only if the claimant proves by\r\nclear and convincing evidence that the harm with respect to which the\r\nclaimant seeks recovery of exemplary damages results from:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(1) fraud;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(2) malice; or</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t(3) wilful act or omission or gross neglect in wrongful death actions\r\nbrought by or on behalf of a surviving spouse or heirs of the decedent's\r\nbody, under a statute enacted pursuant to Section 26, Article XVI, Texas\r\nConstitution. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 41.003(a) (Vernon 1997).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe trial court stated in its findings of fact that Ima misrepresented the value of the\r\nestate to J.T., she intended J.T. to rely on her misrepresentations about the value of the\r\nestate, he actually relied on her misrepresentations, he did not have actual knowledge of\r\nthe true value of the estate, and he suffered damages proximately caused by those\r\nmisrepresentations.  The trial court further found that Ima's actions in misapplying and\r\nconverting estate property, failure to make full disclosure, her misrepresentations about\r\nthe value of the estate, and her failure to account constituted gross misconduct and gross\r\nmismanagement in the performance of her duties as executrix.  Thus, assuming the\r\nevidence was sufficient to support those findings, the trial court could have awarded\r\nexemplary damages.  The question, then, becomes whether the trial court was required\r\nto award exemplary damages in this situation.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe statute itself does not state that exemplary damages must be awarded if fraud\r\nor malice is found, and J.T. has cited no authority that states that proposition.  Punitive\r\ndamages are only proper in exceptional cases.  <em>C &amp; D Robotics, Inc. v. Mann</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749631\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749631/c-d-robotics-inc-v-mann/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 201 (Tex.App.--Texarkana 2001, no pet.).  The factfinder may assess punitive\r\ndamages to deter future misconduct, punish wrongdoers, and reimburse the plaintiff for\r\nremote losses.  <em>Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. v. Lieck</em>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></span>, 946 (Tex.App.--Corpus Christi 1992), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1660254\"><a href=\"/opinion/1660254/browning-ferris-industries-inc-v-lieck/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span> (Tex. 1994).  The\r\nwrongdoer in this instance is an elderly woman, which, as the trial court noted, by her own\r\nadmission is no longer able to fulfill the role of executrix of the estate, at least in part,\r\nbecause of failing eyesight.  The will also gave Ima the right to use the corpus for her own\r\nwelfare, support, and maintenance in the manner to which she was accustomed.  She\r\nnever used that option.  Additionally, there was evidence that Ima and J.T. had long had\r\ndealings with one another, including J.T.'s requests for loans from the estate to resolve his\r\nown bankruptcy problems, and some of those dealings had resulted in litigation by J.T. in\r\nwhich no liability on Ima's part was determined.  In view of all of this, the trial court could\r\nhave determined there was no need to assess exemplary damages to deter future\r\nmisconduct inasmuch as Ima would no longer be in a position to commit those same acts. \r\nIt could also have determined that J.T. had not suffered any remote losses.  J.T.'s sixth\r\ncross-issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn summary, because we have found no reversible error, all issues presented by\r\nboth parties are overruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJohn T.
