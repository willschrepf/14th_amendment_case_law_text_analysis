Beetem, Judge\n\n                  Before Division Three: Victor C. Howard, Presiding Judge,\n                       James E. Welsh, Judge and Gary D. Witt, Judge\n\n\n       William Alton appeals the summary judgment in favor of the Missouri Department of\n\nPublic Safety in his action against it for age discrimination/failure to hire. He contends that a\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact existed as to whether he was an employment applicant under\n\nsection 213.055.1, RSMo 2000. The judgment is affirmed.\n\n       In March 1996, William Alton began working for the Department of Public Safety as a\n\nspecial agent in the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control. In April 2009, Lafayette Lacy\n\nwas hired as the state supervisor for the Division. In May 2010, Mr. Lacy informed twenty-five\n\nagent employees including Mr. Alton that they would be laid off effective June 15, 2010, as a\n\nresult of a budget cut. Mr. Alton, who was fifty-eight years old, believed he had two options: he\n\fcould either be laid off without pay or choose to take retirement. Mr. Alton chose to retire and\n\nrequested that his termination date be delayed and that he be allowed to use accrued vacation\n\ntime from June 15 to June 30 so that he would be eligible for full retirement benefits on July 1,\n\n2010. The Department approved the request. On June 2, 2010, Mr. Alton sent Mr. Lacy a letter\n\nconfirming his plan to retire:\n\n        This is to confirm that I have applied for retirement effective July 1, 2010. I had\n        no intention for retiring that soon, but felt compelled to retire due to the\n        elimination of my job. Thank you for changing the termination date to June 30. I\n        will take vacation from June 16, 2010, to June 30, 2010. Should the situation\n        change prior to June 30th that would allow my continued employment with the\n        Division; please let me know and I will cancel my retirement.\n\nMr. Alton retired effective July 1, 2010.\n\n        Meanwhile, prior to the effective date of the layoff, Mr. Lacy learned that the budget for\n\nfive positions was restored. The five positions covered one agent in each of the five district\n\noffices—Kansas City, Jefferson City, St. Louis, Springfield, and Cape Girardeau. Mr. Lacy sent\n\na letter to the most senior agents inviting them to bid on the five restored positions. Mr. Alton\n\nwas not among the special agents invited to bid for the five restored positions. The restored\n\npositions were filled by the end of May 2010, and the five selected agents began work in the\n\ndistrict offices on June 1.\n\n        Shortly thereafter, the agents staffing the Kansas City and St. Louis offices went on\n\nextended sick leave. Later, the special agent assigned to the Jefferson City office resigned to\n\naccept a job with the Department of Insurance. After the special agents assigned to the Kansas\n\nCity and St. Louis offices exhausted their twelve weeks of FMLA leave, both chose to retire.\n\nAfter the remaining agents transferred to different offices, Mr. Lacy needed to fill agent\n\nvacancies in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Cape Girardeau offices. He contacted former special\n\nagents who lived near each of the district offices and asked whether they wanted to come back to\n\n                                                2\n\fwork for the Division in that office. Specifically, he contacted Charles Bidding (age 51), who\n\nlived in St. Joseph, regarding the Kansas City position; LaMont Mitchell (age 41), who lived in\n\nSt. Louis County, regarding the St. Louis position; and Edward Widenbenner (age 47), who lived\n\nin Farmington, regarding the Cape Girardeau position. Mr. Alton was not called or asked to\n\napply. On September 20, 2010, the Division received written applications from the three agents\n\ncontacted by Mr. Lacy. All three were rehired as special agents in October 2010. On October\n\n15, 2010, after learning of the rehire of agents Bidding, Mitchell, and Widenbenner, Mr. Alton\n\nemailed Mr. Lacy stating, “As you know, I had no intention of retiring from the Division on July\n\n1, 2010, had I not been laid off. This in part is to confirm my request to be immediately\n\nreinstated as a Special Agent.” Mr. Lacy did not respond to Mr. Alton’s email.\n\n       Mr. Alton subsequently brought the present action under the Missouri Human Rights Act\n\n(MHRA) for age discrimination/failure to recall. He alleged that the Department discriminated\n\nagainst him based on his age when it hired LaMont Mitchell, a younger person, without notifying\n\nAlton that the position was available or offering him an opportunity to apply. He further alleged\n\nthat the Division had a policy and practice of rehiring or recalling employees with the most\n\nseniority, and the Division deviated from that policy by rehiring Mr. Mitchell, who was least\n\nsenior and one of the youngest agents in the Division. Mr. Alton did not allege discrimination in\n\nthe elimination of his position in June 2010, in not being invited to bid on the five restored\n\npositions in May 2010, or in the October 2010 rehiring of Mr. Bidding and Mr. Widenbenner,\n\nwho were younger but more senior than him.\n\n       The Department moved for summary judgment arguing that Mr. Alton was not an\n\nemployee or employment applicant of the Division under section 213.055.1 at the time of the\n\nOctober 2010 hiring.\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f       Following argument on the motion, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe Department. It found Mr. Alton was not an employee or an employment applicant of the\n\nDepartment at the time of the alleged discriminatory actions. Specifically, it found that while\n\nMr. Alton’s correspondence indicated a desire to be called back to work if positions became\n\navailable, it was limited by its own terms to availability prior to June 30 and the decisions to hire\n\na person younger than Mr. Alton was not made before June 30. This appeal by Mr. Alton\n\nfollowed.\n\n       In his sole point on appeal, Mr. Alton contends that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the Department because a genuine dispute of material fact\n\nremained as to whether he was a potential applicant for recall/re-hire from layoff such that he\n\nwas entitled to the protections of the MHRA.\n\n       Appellate review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo. ITT Commercial Fin.\n\nCorp. v. Mid-Am. Marine Supply Corp., 854 S.W.2d 371, 376 (Mo. banc 1993). Summary\n\njudgment will be upheld on appeal if the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and no\n\ngenuine issues of material fact exist. Id. at 377. The record is reviewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to the party against whom judgment was entered, according that party all reasonable\n\ninferences that may be drawn from the record. Id. at 376. Facts contained in affidavits or\n\notherwise in support of a party’s motion are accepted as true unless contradicted by the non-\n\nmoving party's response to the summary judgment motion. Id.\n\n       A defending party may establish a right to judgment as a matter of law by showing any\n\none of the following: (1) facts that negate any one of the elements of the claimant’s cause of\n\naction, (2) the non-movant, after an adequate period of discovery, has not and will not be able to\n\nproduce evidence sufficient to allow the trier of fact to find the existence of any one of the\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fclaimant’s elements, or (3) there is no genuine dispute as to the existence of each of the facts\n\nnecessary to support the movant’s properly-pleaded affirmative defense. Id. at 381.\n\n       Once the movant has established a right to judgment as a matter of law, the non-movant\n\nmust demonstrate that one or more of the material facts asserted by the movant as not in dispute\n\nis, in fact, genuinely disputed. Id. The non-moving party may not rely on mere allegations and\n\ndenials of the pleadings, but must use affidavits, depositions, answers to interrogatories, or\n\nadmissions on file to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue for trial. Id.\n\n       As in any summary judgment matter, review of summary judgment in the context of a\n\nMHRA employment discrimination claim must determine whether the record shows two\n\nplausible, but contradictory, accounts of essential facts and the genuine issue in the case is real,\n\nnot merely argumentative, imaginary, or frivolous. Daugherty v. City of Maryland Heights, 231\n\nS.W.3d 814, 820 (Mo. banc 2007). “If the parties disagree on the legal effect and consequences\n\nof the facts, and not the relevant facts themselves, there is no genuine dispute of facts precluding\n\nsummary judgment.” Medley v. Valentine Radford Communications, Inc., 173 S.W.3d 315, 319\n\n(Mo. App. W.D. 2005).\n\n       In deciding a case under the MHRA, courts are guided by both Missouri law and federal\n\nemployment discrimination case law that is consistent with Missouri law. Daugherty v. City of\n\nMaryland Heights, 231 S.W.3d 814, 818 (Mo. banc 2007). The MHRA prohibits unlawful\n\nemployment practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age, or\n\ndisability. Howard v. City of Kansas City, 332 S.W.3d 772, 779 (Mo. banc 2011). Specifically,\n\nsection 213.055, RSMo 2000, is a remedial prohibition against discrimination in the employment\n\ncontext. Id. It provides:\n\n       1. It shall be an unlawful employment practice:\n\n\n\n                                                 5\n\f               (1) For an employer, because of the race, color, religion, national origin,\n       sex, ancestry, age or disability of any individual:\n\n               (a) To fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\n       discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n       conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color,\n       religion, national origin, sex, ancestry, age or disability;\n\n               (b) To limit, segregate, or classify his employees or his employment\n       applicants in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of\n       employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n       because of such individual’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, ancestry,\n       age or disability.\n\n§ 213.055.1.     “A plaintiff can prove discrimination by showing age or any protected\n\ncharacteristics was a contributing factor for the employment action regardless if other factors\n\nalso exist.” Hurst v. Kansas City, Missouri School Dist., 437 S.W.3d 327, 39 (Mo. App. W.D.\n\n2014)(internal quotes and citation omitted).\n\n       Protection under section 213.055.1 requires an employer/employee relationship. Id.;\n\nSloan v. Bankers Life & Cas. Co., 1 S.W.3d 555, 562 (Mo. App. W.D. 1999). See also Coleman\n\nv. Carnahan, 312 S.W.3d 377, 380 (Mo. App. E.D. 2010)(plaintiffs’ MHRA employment\n\ndiscrimination complaint defeated because they “do not allege any potential or actual\n\nemployer/employee relationship between the parties.”). “The MHRA defines ‘employer’ to\n\ninclude ‘the state, or any political or civil subdivision thereof….’” Howard, 332 S.W.3d at 779\n\n(quoting § 213.010(7)). It does not, however, define “employee” or “employment applicant.”\n\nId. The Missouri Supreme Court recently defined the word “employee” for purposes of the\n\nMHRA by looking at its plain and ordinary meaning. Id. at 780. It explained, “The word\n\n‘employee’ is commonly defined as ‘one employed by another, usually in a position below the\n\nexecutive level and usually for wages,’ as well as ‘any worker who is under wages or salary to an\n\nemployer and who is not excluded by agreement from consideration as such a worker.’” Id.\n\n\n\n                                                 6\n\f(quoting WEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 743 (1993)). The Court further\n\nnoted that the term “employee applicant” does not have a dictionary definition. Id.\n\n       Alton does not dispute that he was not an employee of the Department at the time of the\n\nalleged discriminatory actions. Rather, he claims that material facts were in dispute regarding\n\nwhether he was an employee applicant. Typically, to establish a claim for discriminatory failure\n\nto hire, the plaintiff must show that “‘he applied and was qualified for a job for which the\n\nemployer was seeking applicants.’” Green v. City of St. Louis, 507 F.3d 662, 666 (8th Cir.\n\n2007)(quoting Chambers v. Wynne Sch. Dist., 909 F.2d 1214, 1216 (8th Cir. 1990)). However, a\n\nformal application may be excused where the plaintiff “‘made every reasonable effort to convey\n\n[his] interest in the job to the employer.’” Jackson v. United States Parcel Serv., Inc., 643 F.3d\n\n1081, 1086 (8th Cir. 2011)(quoting Chambers, 909 F.2d at 1217)). See Paxton v. Union Nat’l\n\nBank, 688 F.2d 552, 568 (8th Cir. 1982)(where vacancy not posted and plaintiff did not hear\n\nabout it from any other source until after position was filled, his expression of desire to advance\n\nin specific department of bank was sufficient for application). Additionally, a plaintiff may be\n\nexcused from making a formal application where the employer had “‘some reason or duty to\n\nconsider him for the post.’” Green, 507 F.3d 662, 667 (quoting Kehoe v. Anheuser Busch, Inc.,\n\n96 F.3d 1095, 1105 n.13 (8th Cir. 1996)(where supervisors knew they were going to eliminate\n\nplaintiff’s position at the same time they were interviewing candidates for an open position and\n\nplaintiff did not know he was going to be fired until after other opening had already been filled,\n\napplication requirement was excused)).\n\n       The following facts were undisputed. Mr. Alton’s position was to be eliminated effective\n\nJune 15, 2010, due to budget cuts, and he chose to retire on July 1, 2010, rather than to be laid\n\noff without pay. Mr. Alton had no intention of retiring in July 2010 but only did so because of\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fthe elimination of his job. In a June 2, 2010 letter to Mr. Lacy, Mr. Alton expressed his interest\n\nin cancelling his retirement if positions became available before June 30, 2010. Five positions\n\nwere restored before June 30, 2010, and those positions were filled at the end of May/beginning\n\nof June 2010 with the most senior agents. Mr. Alton did not allege discrimination in the filling\n\nof the positions. Of the five restored positions, three became vacant after two agents exhausted\n\ntwelve-weeks of FMLA leave and retired and another resigned to accept another job. Mr. Lacy\n\ncontacted Mr. Bidding, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Widenbenner, and on September 20, 2010, the\n\nDivision received their written applications. All three were rehired as special agents in October\n\n2010. After learning of the hiring, Mr. Alton emailed Mr. Lace on October 15, 2010, asking to\n\nbe reinstated as a special agent.\n\n       These undisputed facts showed that Mr. Alton did not apply for any of the positions filled\n\nduring the October 2010 hiring. Furthermore, he did not make every reasonable effort to convey\n\nhis interest in the jobs and the Division had no reason or duty to consider him for a position at\n\nthat time. By its own terms, Mr. Alton’s June 2, 2010 letter limited his interest in positions that\n\nbecame available before June 30, 2010. Mr. Alton did not contact the Division or Mr. Lacy\n\nabout a position again until his October 15, 2010 email to Mr. Lacy after Mr. Mitchell was\n\nrehired.\n\n       Mr. Alton argued that the manner in which the positions were filled and recent history\n\nand evidence of age discrimination by Mr. Lacy supported a plausible inference that he was an\n\nemployment applicant requiring the issue to be submitted to a jury. In making this argument,\n\nMr. Alton relied on evidence from a previous age discrimination lawsuit by two special agents\n\nthat were laid off in 2009. The two agents were the most senior agents in the Division when they\n\nwere laid off. In their lawsuit, which resulted in a preliminary injunction against the Department,\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fevidence was offered that the Department had a tradition of carrying out budget-driven layoffs\n\nby inverse order of hire (last hired, first fired) and that Mr. Lacy had stated to a district\n\nsupervisor during the 2009 layoff his desire that older agents should retire so younger agents\n\ncould be retained. While these facts were undisputed, they were not material to the issue in this\n\nappeal—the threshold question of whether Mr. Alton was an employment applicant. Rather,\n\nsuch facts would tend to be relevant to whether Mr. Alton’s age was a contributing factor in the\n\nfailure to hire. Because the undisputed facts show that Alton did not express an interest in\n\nreturning to work for the Department after he retired until after the October 2010 rehiring, he\n\nwas not an employment applicant entitled to protections under the MHRA. The trial court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment in favor of the Department. The point is denied.\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            __________________________________________\n                                            VICTOR C.

Should the situation\n        change prior to June 30th that would allow my continued employment with the\n        Division; please let me know and I will cancel my retirement.\n\nMr. Alton retired effective July 1, 2010.\n\n        Meanwhile, prior to the effective date of the layoff, Mr. Lacy learned that the budget for\n\nfive positions was restored. The five positions covered one agent in each of the five district\n\noffices—Kansas City, Jefferson City, St. Louis, Springfield, and Cape Girardeau. Mr. Lacy sent\n\na letter to the most senior agents inviting them to bid on the five restored positions. Mr. Alton\n\nwas not among the special agents invited to bid for the five restored positions. The restored\n\npositions were filled by the end of May 2010, and the five selected agents began work in the\n\ndistrict offices on June 1.\n\n        Shortly thereafter, the agents staffing the Kansas City and St. Louis offices went on\n\nextended sick leave. Later, the special agent assigned to the Jefferson City office resigned to\n\naccept a job with the Department of Insurance. After the special agents assigned to the Kansas\n\nCity and St. Louis offices exhausted their twelve weeks of FMLA leave, both chose to retire.\n\nAfter the remaining agents transferred to different offices, Mr. Lacy needed to fill agent\n\nvacancies in Kansas City, St. Louis, and Cape Girardeau offices. He contacted former special\n\nagents who lived near each of the district offices and asked whether they wanted to come back to\n\n                                                2\n\fwork for the Division in that office. Specifically, he contacted Charles Bidding (age 51), who\n\nlived in St. Joseph, regarding the Kansas City position; LaMont Mitchell (age 41), who lived in\n\nSt. Louis County, regarding the St. Louis position; and Edward Widenbenner (age 47), who lived\n\nin Farmington, regarding the Cape Girardeau position. Mr. Alton was not called or asked to\n\napply. On September 20, 2010, the Division received written applications from the three agents\n\ncontacted by Mr. Lacy. All three were rehired as special agents in October 2010. On October\n\n15, 2010, after learning of the rehire of agents Bidding, Mitchell, and Widenbenner, Mr. Alton\n\nemailed Mr. Lacy stating, “As you know, I had no intention of retiring from the Division on July\n\n1, 2010, had I not been laid off. This in part is to confirm my request to be immediately\n\nreinstated as a Special Agent.” Mr. Lacy did not respond to Mr. Alton’s email.\n\n       Mr. Alton subsequently brought the present action under the Missouri Human Rights Act\n\n(MHRA) for age discrimination/failure to recall. He alleged that the Department discriminated\n\nagainst him based on his age when it hired LaMont Mitchell, a younger person, without notifying\n\nAlton that the position was available or offering him an opportunity to apply. He further alleged\n\nthat the Division had a policy and practice of rehiring or recalling employees with the most\n\nseniority, and the Division deviated from that policy by rehiring Mr. Mitchell, who was least\n\nsenior and one of the youngest agents in the Division. Mr. Alton did not allege discrimination in\n\nthe elimination of his position in June 2010, in not being invited to bid on the five restored\n\npositions in May 2010, or in the October 2010 rehiring of Mr. Bidding and Mr. Widenbenner,\n\nwho were younger but more senior than him.\n\n       The Department moved for summary judgment arguing that Mr. Alton was not an\n\nemployee or employment applicant of the Division under section 213.055.1 at the time of the\n\nOctober 2010 hiring.\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f       Following argument on the motion, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of\n\nthe Department. It found Mr. Alton was not an employee or an employment applicant of the\n\nDepartment at the time of the alleged discriminatory actions. Specifically, it found that while\n\nMr. Alton’s correspondence indicated a desire to be called back to work if positions became\n\navailable, it was limited by its own terms to availability prior to June 30 and the decisions to hire\n\na person younger than Mr. Alton was not made before June 30. This appeal by Mr. Alton\n\nfollowed.\n\n       In his sole point on appeal, Mr. Alton contends that the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of the Department because a genuine dispute of material fact\n\nremained as to whether he was a potential applicant for recall/re-hire from layoff such that he\n\nwas entitled to the protections of the MHRA.\n\n       Appellate review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo.

Mr. Alton’s position was to be eliminated effective\n\nJune 15, 2010, due to budget cuts, and he chose to retire on July 1, 2010, rather than to be laid\n\noff without pay. Mr. Alton had no intention of retiring in July 2010 but only did so because of\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\fthe elimination of his job. In a June 2, 2010 letter to Mr. Lacy, Mr. Alton expressed his interest\n\nin cancelling his retirement if positions became available before June 30, 2010. Five positions\n\nwere restored before June 30, 2010, and those positions were filled at the end of May/beginning\n\nof June 2010 with the most senior agents. Mr. Alton did not allege discrimination in the filling\n\nof the positions. Of the five restored positions, three became vacant after two agents exhausted\n\ntwelve-weeks of FMLA leave and retired and another resigned to accept another job. Mr. Lacy\n\ncontacted Mr. Bidding, Mr. Mitchell, and Mr. Widenbenner, and on September 20, 2010, the\n\nDivision received their written applications. All three were rehired as special agents in October\n\n2010. After learning of the hiring, Mr. Alton emailed Mr. Lace on October 15, 2010, asking to\n\nbe reinstated as a special agent.\n\n       These undisputed facts showed that Mr. Alton did not apply for any of the positions filled\n\nduring the October 2010 hiring. Furthermore, he did not make every reasonable effort to convey\n\nhis interest in the jobs and the Division had no reason or duty to consider him for a position at\n\nthat time. By its own terms, Mr. Alton’s June 2, 2010 letter limited his interest in positions that\n\nbecame available before June 30, 2010. Mr. Alton did not contact the Division or Mr. Lacy\n\nabout a position again until his October 15, 2010 email to Mr. Lacy after Mr. Mitchell was\n\nrehired.\n\n       Mr. Alton argued that the manner in which the positions were filled and recent history\n\nand evidence of age discrimination by Mr. Lacy supported a plausible inference that he was an\n\nemployment applicant requiring the issue to be submitted to a jury. In making this argument,\n\nMr. Alton relied on evidence from a previous age discrimination lawsuit by two special agents\n\nthat were laid off in 2009. The two agents were the most senior agents in the Division when they\n\nwere laid off. In their lawsuit, which resulted in a preliminary injunction against the Department,\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\fevidence was offered that the Department had a tradition of carrying out budget-driven layoffs\n\nby inverse order of hire (last hired, first fired) and that Mr. Lacy had stated to a district\n\nsupervisor during the 2009 layoff his desire that older agents should retire so younger agents\n\ncould be retained. While these facts were undisputed, they were not material to the issue in this\n\nappeal—the threshold question of whether Mr. Alton was an employment applicant. Rather,\n\nsuch facts would tend to be relevant to whether Mr. Alton’s age was a contributing factor in the\n\nfailure to hire. Because the undisputed facts show that Alton did not express an interest in\n\nreturning to work for the Department after he retired until after the October 2010 rehiring, he\n\nwas not an employment applicant entitled to protections under the MHRA. The trial court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment in favor of the Department. The point is denied.\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            __________________________________________\n                                            VICTOR C.
