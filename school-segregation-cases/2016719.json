Although this court has yet to determine whether <i>Ring</i> applies retroactively, because \"the rule in <i>Ring</i> is essentially an application of <i>Apprendi,</i> logical consistency suggests that the rule announced in <i>Ring</i> is not retroactively applicable.\" <i>In re Johnson,</i> 334 F.3d 403, 405 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that <i>Ring</i> applies retroactively, \"neither <i>Ring</i> [nor] <i>Apprendi</i>... render[s] the <i>absence</i> of mental retardation the functional equivalent of an element of capital murder which the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 405 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Thus, because <i>Apprendi</i> does not apply retroactively to Webster's initial &#167; 2255 motion, and <i>Ring,</i> even if retroactive, does not render the absence of mental retardation an element of the sentence that is constitutionally required to be determined by a jury, Webster has failed to make the requisite showing.

The district court's denial of relief is not debatable among jurists of reason, even on threshold review, so we deny a COA on these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster contends that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to investigate and present additional mitigating evidence demonstrating mental retardation and the extreme abuse he suffered as a child. The district court denied habeas relief, characterizing this ineffective assistance claim as one of degree &#8212; i.e., Webster does not allege that counsel utterly failed to present evidence of mental retardation and child abuse but, instead, that counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present <i>enough</i> of such evidence. After engaging in an exhaustive review of the trial record, the district court determined that defense counsel presented a significant amount of such evidence; and, although more of the same or similar evidence could have been furnished, counsel were not constitutionally ineffective for failing to present more of the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, our review of the trial record confirms that Webster's counsel were far from constitutionally ineffective in investigating and presenting evidence of his mental condition and the abuse he suffered as a child. During the punishment phase, counsel presented lengthy and detailed testimony from four medical experts regarding Webster's mental capacity<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and the testimony of a fifth medical expert on surrebuttal to critique the methodology used by one of the government's experts in testing Webster's cognitive abilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, counsel presented substantial evidence of the abuse Webster suffered as a child, including testimony from his mother, two of his brothers, two of his sisters, an aunt, a niece, and an ex-girlfriend. All of these witnesses testified about the severe physical and sexual abuse that Webster's father inflicted on his children and his wife (Webster's mother). These witnesses recounted graphic and violent stories of sexual abuse; weekly beatings with hoses, fan belts, and extension cords; and various other forms of torture, including electric shock and burning. Even further, counsel presented testimony from an officer of the juvenile court in Arkansas that removed one of Webster's siblings from the home because of abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this substantial body of evidence and the pre-trial investigation its presentation required, Webster's generalized allegation that more evidence of mental retardation and child abuse should have been presented is arguably frivolous. In any event, it is insufficient to demonstrate objectively deficient performance by counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Because Webster has failed to make the requisite showing of deficient performance, we need not address the prejudice portion of the <i>Washington</i> inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster faults his trial counsel for failing to investigate and present evidence of racial discrimination allegedly existing in the district where he attended school. Webster claims it is vitally important for counsel to demonstrate that the reason he was not enrolled in special education courses was the district's racially discriminatory practice of not placing black students in such courses even when necessary, and not because he did not qualify. Had such evidence been presented, Webster contends, it would have effectively countered the government's assertion that he is not mentally retarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying habeas relief, the district court concluded that Webster had failed to establish either prong of the <i>Washington</i> standard on this claim. Significantly, the court disagreed with Webster about the salience of the evidence. First, the court observed that the government disputed Webster's claim of mental retardation primarily through the testimony of its medical experts, cross-examination of Webster's medical experts, and the testimony of other witnesses familiar with Webster both in and out of the prison system. Thus, although certain government witnesses noted the fact that Webster was not in special education courses, this point was merely incidental to the government's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court noted that Webster's brother Mark testified that most of his brothers <i>were</i> in special education classes, and Tony Webster acknowledged that he was in \"resource\" classes. Surmising that any evidence that the school district did not place black students in special education classes when necessary would have been countered by such testimony, the court concluded that counsel could not be faulted for failing to pursue this track.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that counsel's failure to investigate and present such evidence constitutes objectively deficient performance, the district court's conclusion that Webster cannot demonstrate the requisite prejudice is not debatable. Indeed, in rejecting Webster's claim on direct appeal that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the conclusion that he was not mentally retarded, this court noted that \"[t]he government presented <i>substantial</i> evidence to support the finding.\" <i>Webster,</i> 162 F.3d at 353 (emphasis added). Consequently, the incremental impeachment value, if any, of such evidence does not raise a reasonable possibility that, had the evidence been presented, the outcome would have been different.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> We therefore deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster contends that his trial counsel were ineffective in allowing a breakdown in communication and a dispute over fees with the mitigation specialist to affect the investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence. Although the factual basis underlying this claim differs from his other ineffective assistance claims, the substance of the claim remains the same: But for this \"breakdown,\" additional mitigating evidence of mental retardation, child abuse, and racial discrimination in school could have been discovered and presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster's vague and generalized allegations of additional (unspecified) evidence of retardation and extreme child abuse notwithstanding, defense counsel presented substantial quantities of mitigating evidence concerning retardation and child abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Webster cannot, therefore, on threshold review, establish either deficient performance or prejudice for this claim. We therefore deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster claims ineffective assistance from counsel's failure to object to the district court's factual finding, discussed above, that he is not mentally retarded and thus is not exempt from the death penalty under &#167; 3596(c). The district court disagreed, concluding that counsel's failure to object to the finding cannot be deemed ineffective assistance when it was not evident, based on the law at the time, that a potential error had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of trial (which is what matters when assessing counsel's performance),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> there was no law on who has the authority to decide &#8212; court or jury &#8212; whether a defendant is mentally retarded within the meaning of &#167; 3596(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, there was no legal basis on which trial counsel could conclude (or even suspect) that the court had committed error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> This dearth of authority persists even today; no statutory amendment or judicial decision has addressed whether the mental retardation finding envisioned by &#167; 3596(c) is a question for the court or the jury. Moreover, even if there were a subsequent legal development holding that the jury is the fact-finder required by &#167; 3596(c), the admonition to reviewing courts to \"eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight ... and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time,\" <i>Washington,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, would render Webster's claim meritless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It follows, then, that counsel cannot be deemed constitutionally ineffective for failing to anticipate a \"subsequent development,\" and Webster cannot rely on the failure to object as a basis for showing deficient performance. Reasonable jurists cannot disagree with the district court's conclusion that counsel were not constitutionally ineffective. We deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster seeks a COA on his claim that the prosecution withheld impeachment evidence in contravention of its due process obligation under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and its progeny. The evidence allegedly withheld is the same material Webster faults his trial counsel for not investigating and presenting to the jury: alleged racial discrimination in the district where Webster attended school and specific evidence of the district's discriminatory practice of failing to place black students in special education classes when necessary. As with his ineffective assistance claim, Webster maintains that disclosure of this evidence would have provided a basis for impeaching government witnesses who testified that he was not mentally retarded and who noted the fact that he was not enrolled in special education classes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The right to due process is violated where, on request, the government conceals evidence (exculpatory as well as impeachment) that is favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or innocence, irrespective of the good faith of the prosecution. <i>See id.</i> at 87-88, 83 S.Ct. 1194; <i>United States v.

The district court's denial of relief is not debatable among jurists of reason, even on threshold review, so we deny a COA on these claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster contends that his trial counsel were ineffective in failing to investigate and present additional mitigating evidence demonstrating mental retardation and the extreme abuse he suffered as a child. The district court denied habeas relief, characterizing this ineffective assistance claim as one of degree &#8212; i.e., Webster does not allege that counsel utterly failed to present evidence of mental retardation and child abuse but, instead, that counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present <i>enough</i> of such evidence. After engaging in an exhaustive review of the trial record, the district court determined that defense counsel presented a significant amount of such evidence; and, although more of the same or similar evidence could have been furnished, counsel were not constitutionally ineffective for failing to present more of the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, our review of the trial record confirms that Webster's counsel were far from constitutionally ineffective in investigating and presenting evidence of his mental condition and the abuse he suffered as a child. During the punishment phase, counsel presented lengthy and detailed testimony from four medical experts regarding Webster's mental capacity<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and the testimony of a fifth medical expert on surrebuttal to critique the methodology used by one of the government's experts in testing Webster's cognitive abilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, counsel presented substantial evidence of the abuse Webster suffered as a child, including testimony from his mother, two of his brothers, two of his sisters, an aunt, a niece, and an ex-girlfriend. All of these witnesses testified about the severe physical and sexual abuse that Webster's father inflicted on his children and his wife (Webster's mother). These witnesses recounted graphic and violent stories of sexual abuse; weekly beatings with hoses, fan belts, and extension cords; and various other forms of torture, including electric shock and burning. Even further, counsel presented testimony from an officer of the juvenile court in Arkansas that removed one of Webster's siblings from the home because of abuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this substantial body of evidence and the pre-trial investigation its presentation required, Webster's generalized allegation that more evidence of mental retardation and child abuse should have been presented is arguably frivolous. In any event, it is insufficient to demonstrate objectively deficient performance by counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Because Webster has failed to make the requisite showing of deficient performance, we need not address the prejudice portion of the <i>Washington</i> inquiry.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> We deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster faults his trial counsel for failing to investigate and present evidence of racial discrimination allegedly existing in the district where he attended school. Webster claims it is vitally important for counsel to demonstrate that the reason he was not enrolled in special education courses was the district's racially discriminatory practice of not placing black students in such courses even when necessary, and not because he did not qualify. Had such evidence been presented, Webster contends, it would have effectively countered the government's assertion that he is not mentally retarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying habeas relief, the district court concluded that Webster had failed to establish either prong of the <i>Washington</i> standard on this claim. Significantly, the court disagreed with Webster about the salience of the evidence. First, the court observed that the government disputed Webster's claim of mental retardation primarily through the testimony of its medical experts, cross-examination of Webster's medical experts, and the testimony of other witnesses familiar with Webster both in and out of the prison system. Thus, although certain government witnesses noted the fact that Webster was not in special education courses, this point was merely incidental to the government's case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court noted that Webster's brother Mark testified that most of his brothers <i>were</i> in special education classes, and Tony Webster acknowledged that he was in \"resource\" classes. Surmising that any evidence that the school district did not place black students in special education classes when necessary would have been countered by such testimony, the court concluded that counsel could not be faulted for failing to pursue this track.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that counsel's failure to investigate and present such evidence constitutes objectively deficient performance, the district court's conclusion that Webster cannot demonstrate the requisite prejudice is not debatable. Indeed, in rejecting Webster's claim on direct appeal that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the conclusion that he was not mentally retarded, this court noted that \"[t]he government presented <i>substantial</i> evidence to support the finding.\" <i>Webster,</i> 162 F.3d at 353 (emphasis added). Consequently, the incremental impeachment value, if any, of such evidence does not raise a reasonable possibility that, had the evidence been presented, the outcome would have been different.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> We therefore deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster contends that his trial counsel were ineffective in allowing a breakdown in communication and a dispute over fees with the mitigation specialist to affect the investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence. Although the factual basis underlying this claim differs from his other ineffective assistance claims, the substance of the claim remains the same: But for this \"breakdown,\" additional mitigating evidence of mental retardation, child abuse, and racial discrimination in school could have been discovered and presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster's vague and generalized allegations of additional (unspecified) evidence of retardation and extreme child abuse notwithstanding, defense counsel presented substantial quantities of mitigating evidence concerning retardation and child abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a> Webster cannot, therefore, on threshold review, establish either deficient performance or prejudice for this claim. We therefore deny a COA on this ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>4.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Webster claims ineffective assistance from counsel's failure to object to the district court's factual finding, discussed above, that he is not mentally retarded and thus is not exempt from the death penalty under &#167; 3596(c). The district court disagreed, concluding that counsel's failure to object to the finding cannot be deemed ineffective assistance when it was not evident, based on the law at the time, that a potential error had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of trial (which is what matters when assessing counsel's performance),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> there was no law on who has the authority to decide &#8212; court or jury &#8212; whether a defendant is mentally retarded within the meaning of &#167; 3596(c).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> Thus, there was no legal basis on which trial counsel could conclude (or even suspect) that the court had committed error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> This dearth of authority persists even today; no statutory amendment or judicial decision has addressed whether the mental retardation finding envisioned by &#167; 3596(c) is a question for the court or the jury. Moreover, even if there were a subsequent legal development holding that the jury is the fact-finder required by &#167; 3596(c), the admonition to reviewing courts to \"eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight ... and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time,\" <i>Washington,</i> 466 U.S. at 689, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
