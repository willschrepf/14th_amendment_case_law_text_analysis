We will spell the name as LeVine himself spells it.\n\fqualified immunity. LeVine appeals. Reviewing the grant of summary judgment de\nnovo, we affirm.\n\n                         I. Facts and Procedural History\n\n       In November 2004, Correctional Officer Tonya Youngs summoned LeVine, a\nsixty-eight year old inmate, to provide a urine sample for random drug testing being\nconducted pursuant to the Offender Substance Abuse Testing provisions adopted by\nthe Missouri Department of Corrections in July 2004. Part III.B. of this policy\nprovided in relevant part:\n\n      2.     There shall be no physical contact between staff and offender\n             during specimen collection.\n\n                                 *   *    *    *   *\n\n      4.     Offenders who refuse or fail to produce a urine specimen of at\n             least 30cc (1 oz or half a bottle) within two hours will be subject\n             to disciplinary action.\n\n             a. The offender will be provided with approximately 12 ounces\n                of water.\n\n       LeVine tried but failed to provide a urine specimen within two hours. The\nparties disagree whether Youngs told LeVine he would lose visitation privileges and\nbe placed in administrative segregation if he failed to provide a specimen. They agree\nthat LeVine told Youngs he suffers from an enlarged prostate, and that Youngs then\ncalled a prison medical officer, who verified LeVine’s condition and advised Youngs\nto give him more time. She allowed him another ten minutes and gave him more\nwater to drink, but to no avail. Youngs submitted an affidavit averring that “LeVine\nthen volunteered to go to medical for catheterization in order to provide a urine\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsample.” Youngs called medical staff, who advised “it was ok for him to do this.”\nLeVine was then escorted by correctional officer Patrick Dunlap to the medical unit.\n\n      LeVine submitted an affidavit averring, “Youngs instructed me that I would be\ntaken to the hospital in order for a urine sample to be collected by catheterization.”\nBut at a prior deposition, he testified that, before entering prison, he had been\ncatheterized by a private physician on two occasions when he could not urinate, and\nhe was ambiguous on the question whether he volunteered to be catheterized:\n\n             Q. If . . . it’s Defendant Youngs’ testimony that you made the\n      offer to be catheterized, do you disagree with that?\n\n             A. Did I -- that I agreed to it?\n\n             Q. That you proposed the idea of being catheterized.\n\n            A. No; because I had a swollen prostate and I got cancer. That’s\n      the only way I could keep from going to the hole. They would have put\n      me in the hole if I didn’t.\n\n       When they arrived at the medical unit, Dunlap told nurse Kathleen Roebuck that\nLeVine was there for catheterization so he could provide a urine sample for a drug\ntest. There is some dispute whether LeVine consented to the procedure. Roebuck\nsubmitted an affidavit averring that, when Dunlap said LeVine wished to be\ncatheterized, she “looked to Mr. Levine for confirmation,” and he “shrugged and\nstated, ‘Go ahead. I don’t mind.’” On the other hand, LeVine testified:\n\n           Q. . . . [I]sn’t it true that you . . . did tell Kathleen Roebuck that\n      you were agreeing to be catheterized at that time?\n\n           A. No, I don’t think so. I think Dunlap told her that he brought\n      me over there for that purpose.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                                 *   *    *    *   *\n\n            Q. So your testimony is that she then catheterized you against\n      your will?\n\n             A. I would say yes. It’s my . . . understanding after the fact that\n      I was supposed to sign a paper giving them permission to do it but they\n      never offered me one.\n\n                                 *   *    *    *   *\n\n             Q. . . . Did you tell Kathleen Roebuck that you had any objections\n      to being catheterized at that time?\n\n            A. I wasn’t given the opportunity to do that.\n\n       In the medical unit, Roebuck attempted to insert a catheter through LeVine’s\nurethra into the bladder but encountered resistance, presumably because LeVine’s\nurethra had been narrowed by his enlarged prostate gland. Several times, Roebuck\nbacked the catheter out and attempted to reinsert it. LeVine claims he asked Roebuck\nto stop because the procedure was extremely painful. Another nurse, Donnie Greim,\nattempted to assist Roebuck; he too was unsuccessful. A medical unit physician was\nsummoned and directed the nurses to cease. When they withdrew the catheter, blood\nand tissue were evident on its tip. LeVine was given antibiotics and pain medication\nand returned to his cell. When he complained of continued pain and inability to\nurinate, physician Milo Farnham ordered him transferred to a public hospital, where\nhe was successfully catheterized and provided a urine sample that tested drug-free.\nAt Dr. Farnham’s direction, the catheter remained in place for as many as nine days.\nLeVine had no complications or permanent injury after the catheter was removed.\n\n       After exhausting prison remedies, LeVine commenced this § 1983 damage\naction against Youngs, Roebuck, and Greim. Defendants filed separate motions for\nsummary judgment. The motions assumed for summary judgment purposes that\n\n                                         -4-\n\fYoungs threatened LeVine with a conduct violation and that LeVine did not consent\nto be catheterized. The district court granted the motions, concluding that defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity from LeVine’s Fourth Amendment claims and did\nnot violate his Eighth Amendment rights. This appeal followed.\n\n                           II. Fourth Amendment Claims\n\n       LeVine first argues that the district court erred in granting defendants qualified\nimmunity on his Fourth Amendment claims “because the right of a prisoner to be free\nfrom an involuntary catheterization as part of random drug testing” was clearly\nestablished at the time he was required to undergo this procedure. See Harlow v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818-19 (1982) (qualified immunity standard). We agree\nwith two principles on which this argument is premised. First, “state-compelled\ncollection and testing of urine . . . constitutes a ‘search’ subject to the demands of the\nFourth Amendment.” Vernonia Sch. Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 652 (1995).\nSecond, prison inmates are entitled to Fourth Amendment protection against\nunreasonable searches of their bodies, see Seltzer-Bey v. Delo, 66 F.3d 961, 963 (8th\nCir.1995), although “a prison inmate has a far lower expectation of privacy than do\nmost other individuals in our society.” Goff v. Nix, 803 F.2d 358, 365 (8th Cir.\n1986), cert denied, 484 U.S. 835 (1987); see generally Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S.\n517, 525-28 (1984); Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 558-60 (1979).\n\n      In Spence v. Farrier, 807 F.2d 753, 755 (8th Cir. 1986), we held that random\nurinalysis testing of inmates did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the prison\nsystem’s security interest in detecting the unauthorized use of narcotics,2 and the\ninmates’ diminished expectations of privacy, justified a “truly random” procedure for\n\n\n      2\n       “[T]he unauthorized use of narcotics is a problem that plagues virtually every\npenal and detention center in the country.” Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 588-89\n(1984).\n\n                                           -5-\n\fselecting the inmates to be tested. Spence did not involve use of the more intrusive\nprocedure of involuntary catheterization to obtain a urine sample. That procedure was\nat issue in Sparks v. Stutler, 71 F.3d 259 (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 948\n(1996), where prison officials ordered an inmate catheterized after they found a\nsyringe in his shoe and he failed to provide a urine sample. The Seventh Circuit\ndescribed catheterization as “more intrusive than a needle but less intrusive than a\nscalpel, making it hard to classify . . . under an objective reasonableness inquiry.” Id.\nat 261. Without concluding whether a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred, the\ncourt reversed the district court’s denial of qualified immunity. In Sparks, there was\nreasonable suspicion of drug use, a factor not present in this case. In another group\nof cases, exemplified by Tinius v. Carroll County Sheriff Dept., 321 F. Supp. 2d 1064,\n1070, 1074-76 (N.D. Ia. 2004), courts have held that involuntary catheterization to\nobtain a urine sample for medical purposes -- such as determining the proper course\nof treatment -- does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Relying on these cases,\ndefendants argue that LeVine’s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated even if\nhe was involuntarily catheterized to obtain a urine sample for a random drug test. We\nneed not accept that argument to decide this case.\n\n       The district court rejected defendants’ categorical argument and concluded that\ncorrectional officer Youngs violated LeVine’s Fourth Amendment rights because\n“involuntary catheterization of a 68-year-old man with a history of prostate problems,\nas part of a random drug screening and without suspicion, is unreasonable” when\nother less intrusive options are available, such as keeping LeVine in a room until he\nwas able to urinate. The court then granted Youngs qualified immunity because “the\nlaw of the Eighth Circuit was not clearly established at the time of [her] actions.”\n\n       In Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001), the Supreme Court held that, in\ndeciding an issue of qualified immunity, a court must first consider a “threshold\nquestion”: “[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the\nfacts alleged show the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right?” If so, then\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthe court turns to the question whether the right was clearly established at the time in\nquestion. In recent cases, four Justices have urged that Saucier’s rigid “order of\nbattle” be overruled. See Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.S. 194, 201 (2004) (Breyer, J.,\njoined by Scalia and Ginsburg, JJ., concurring); Bunting v. Mellen, 541 U.S. 1019\n(2004) (Stevens, J., respecting the denial of certiorari). In Scott v. Harris, 127 S. Ct.\n1769, 1774 n.4 (2007), the majority declined to address “the wisdom of Saucier . . .\nbecause the constitutional question with which we are presented is . . . easily decided,”\nbut the concurring Justices again criticized “the order-of-battle rule.”3 Their criticism\nrests in part on the concern that, if the defendant loses the constitutional question but\nwins on qualified immunity, the rule “may immunize an incorrect constitutional ruling\nfrom review.” Id. at 1780 (Breyer, J., concurring). That concern is present in this\ncase, because the district court has posited a constitutional right that is both\nunprecedented in prior cases and so far removed from a plausible interpretation of the\nfacts that it appears to be an impermissible advisory opinion. We need not resolve the\ndilemma, however, because the court’s constitutional ruling depended upon an\nassumed fact for which there is no support in the record. Accordingly, applying the\nSaucier order of battle, we conclude that no constitutional violation has been shown\nwithout considering or approving the constitutional right posited by the district court.\n\n      The critical fact assumed by the district court was that correctional officer\nYoungs ordered the prison’s medical professionals to perform an involuntary\ncatheterization. Absent this fact, the record viewed most favorably to LeVine shows\nthat Youngs threatened or warned LeVine that he would be subject to discipline for\nbeing unable to produce a urine specimen, which was consistent with § III.B.4 of the\nDepartment’s drug testing policy. When LeVine could not provide a sample, Youngs\ncould have returned him to his cell, written up his failure, and left to others the\n\n      3\n       In granting certiorari in Pearson v. Callahan, No. 07-751 (Mar. 24, 2008), the\nCourt directed the parties to brief and argue an additional question, “Whether the\nCourt’s decision in Saucier . . . should be overruled.” The Court heard argument in\nPearson on October 14, 2008.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fultimate question of discipline. Instead, after learning of his enlarged prostate from\nLeVine and the medical staff, Youngs directed correctional officer Dunlap to take\nLeVine to the medical unit for catheterization, a procedure LeVine had undergone\ntwice before when he “couldn’t urinate.” LeVine’s complaint and deposition\ntestimony alleged, not that he refused the procedure, but that his consent or\nacquiescence was induced by the threat of prison discipline. But even if Youngs\nordered LeVine to go to the medical unit, she had no contact with the medical\nprofessionals after he arrived and no authority to direct those professionals to\nundertake the catheterization procedure if they thought it medically inappropriate or\nif patient LeVine refused to consent. LeVine did not sue Officer Dunlap and makes\nno claim that he ordered the medical professionals to undertake the catheterization, an\naction that would have been beyond Dunlap’s knowledge and authority. Liability for\ndamages under § 1983 is personal. Doran v. Eckold, 409 F.3d 958, 965 (8th Cir.\n2005) (en banc). The district court erred in concluding that Youngs violated LeVine’s\nFourth Amendment rights because LeVine presented no evidence that Youngs was\npersonally responsible for any involuntary catheterization that occurred.\n\n       The district court concluded that the actions of nurses Roebuck and Greim as\nmedical staff were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law because\nthey “were simply following a request from Youngs.” Citing Sparks and Spence,\nLeVine argues that these nurses “were aware, or minimally should be aware, that an\ninvoluntary catheterization for a non-medical purpose is against a prisoner’s 4th\nAmendment rights.” But that proposition was not clearly established by those cases,\nor by any other. Given the undisputed evidence that LeVine had undergone voluntary\ncatheterization in the past when he was unable to urinate, and that the nurses used\nproper technique in attempting this rather common and safe though painful procedure,\nthe grant of qualified immunity must be upheld. See Sparks, 71 F.3d at 261.\n\n     LeVine further argues that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment on his Fourth Amendment claims because Roebuck and Greim initially\n\n                                         -8-\n\fsought summary judgment only on his Eighth Amendment claims. We disagree. The\nnurses’ motion for summary judgment interpreted LeVine’s ambiguous pro se\ncomplaint as asserting only an Eighth Amendment claim regarding their medical\ntreatment. When LeVine’s response clarified that he was asserting Fourth\nAmendment claims against all defendants, Roebuck and Greim addressed the Fourth\nAmendment claims in their reply memorandum. The district court construed the\ncomplaint as adequately stating Fourth Amendment claims against the nurses and\nresolved this fully briefed issue, which was well within its discretion.\n\n                          III. Eighth Amendment Claims\n\n       In the district court, LeVine’s summary judgment memorandum clarified that\nhe was asserting Eighth Amendment claims for defendants’ alleged brutality, rather\nthan for their deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.4 The standard for\nan Eighth Amendment brutality claim is whether force was applied “maliciously and\nsadistically for the very purpose of causing him.” Berryhill v. Schriro, 137 F.3d 1073,\n1076 (8th Cir. 1998). The district court granted summary judgment dismissing these\nclaims, concluding there is no evidence that any defendant used force maliciously and\nsadistically for the purpose of causing LeVine harm. We agree. “One acts\nmaliciously by undertaking, without just cause or reason, a course of action intended\nto injure another” and “sadistically by engaging in extreme or excessive cruelty or by\ndelighting in cruelty.” Howard v. Barnett, 21 F.3d 868, 872 (8th Cir. 1994)\n\n      4\n       The record does not reveal a viable claim of deliberate indifference. Dr.\nFarnham submitted an affidavit averring that difficulty inserting a catheter into the\nbladder of a man with an enlarged prostate is not uncommon, that the nurses used\nproper technique in attempting to catheterize LeVine, and that it was proper medical\ntreatment to successfully catheterize LeVine at the hospital and then leave the catheter\nin place for several days to allow his injury to heal. LeVine submitted no evidence\nor expert opinion to the contrary.\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f(quotations omitted). In his deposition, LeVine admitted that defendants acted for the\nlegitimate purpose of obtaining a urine sample for a random drug test. He asserted\nthat Roebuck “didn’t know what she was doing,” but not that she was attempting to\nhurt him. He complained that Youngs threatened him with a conduct violation if he\ndid not provide a sample. These allegations fall far short of raising a genuine issue\nof material fact as to whether the defendants acted with a sufficiently culpable state\nof mind to support an Eighth Amendment brutality claim.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f",

There shall be no physical contact between staff and offender\n             during specimen collection.\n\n                                 *   *    *    *   *\n\n      4.     Offenders who refuse or fail to produce a urine specimen of at\n             least 30cc (1 oz or half a bottle) within two hours will be subject\n             to disciplinary action.\n\n             a. The offender will be provided with approximately 12 ounces\n                of water.\n\n       LeVine tried but failed to provide a urine specimen within two hours. The\nparties disagree whether Youngs told LeVine he would lose visitation privileges and\nbe placed in administrative segregation if he failed to provide a specimen. They agree\nthat LeVine told Youngs he suffers from an enlarged prostate, and that Youngs then\ncalled a prison medical officer, who verified LeVine’s condition and advised Youngs\nto give him more time. She allowed him another ten minutes and gave him more\nwater to drink, but to no avail. Youngs submitted an affidavit averring that “LeVine\nthen volunteered to go to medical for catheterization in order to provide a urine\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsample.” Youngs called medical staff, who advised “it was ok for him to do this.”\nLeVine was then escorted by correctional officer Patrick Dunlap to the medical unit.\n\n      LeVine submitted an affidavit averring, “Youngs instructed me that I would be\ntaken to the hospital in order for a urine sample to be collected by catheterization.”\nBut at a prior deposition, he testified that, before entering prison, he had been\ncatheterized by a private physician on two occasions when he could not urinate, and\nhe was ambiguous on the question whether he volunteered to be catheterized:\n\n             Q. If . . . it’s Defendant Youngs’ testimony that you made the\n      offer to be catheterized, do you disagree with that?\n\n             A. Did I -- that I agreed to it?\n\n             Q. That you proposed the idea of being catheterized.\n\n            A. No; because I had a swollen prostate and I got cancer. That’s\n      the only way I could keep from going to the hole. They would have put\n      me in the hole if I didn’t.\n\n       When they arrived at the medical unit, Dunlap told nurse Kathleen Roebuck that\nLeVine was there for catheterization so he could provide a urine sample for a drug\ntest. There is some dispute whether LeVine consented to the procedure. Roebuck\nsubmitted an affidavit averring that, when Dunlap said LeVine wished to be\ncatheterized, she “looked to Mr. Levine for confirmation,” and he “shrugged and\nstated, ‘Go ahead. I don’t mind.’” On the other hand, LeVine testified:\n\n           Q. . . . [I]sn’t it true that you . . . did tell Kathleen Roebuck that\n      you were agreeing to be catheterized at that time?\n\n           A. No, I don’t think so. I think Dunlap told her that he brought\n      me over there for that purpose.\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f                                 *   *    *    *   *\n\n            Q. So your testimony is that she then catheterized you against\n      your will?\n\n             A. I would say yes. It’s my . . . understanding after the fact that\n      I was supposed to sign a paper giving them permission to do it but they\n      never offered me one.\n\n                                 *   *    *    *   *\n\n             Q. . . . Did you tell Kathleen Roebuck that you had any objections\n      to being catheterized at that time?\n\n            A. I wasn’t given the opportunity to do that.\n\n       In the medical unit, Roebuck attempted to insert a catheter through LeVine’s\nurethra into the bladder but encountered resistance, presumably because LeVine’s\nurethra had been narrowed by his enlarged prostate gland. Several times, Roebuck\nbacked the catheter out and attempted to reinsert it. LeVine claims he asked Roebuck\nto stop because the procedure was extremely painful. Another nurse, Donnie Greim,\nattempted to assist Roebuck; he too was unsuccessful. A medical unit physician was\nsummoned and directed the nurses to cease. When they withdrew the catheter, blood\nand tissue were evident on its tip. LeVine was given antibiotics and pain medication\nand returned to his cell. When he complained of continued pain and inability to\nurinate, physician Milo Farnham ordered him transferred to a public hospital, where\nhe was successfully catheterized and provided a urine sample that tested drug-free.\nAt Dr. Farnham’s direction, the catheter remained in place for as many as nine days.\nLeVine had no complications or permanent injury after the catheter was removed.\n\n       After exhausting prison remedies, LeVine commenced this § 1983 damage\naction against Youngs, Roebuck, and Greim. Defendants filed separate motions for\nsummary judgment. The motions assumed for summary judgment purposes that\n\n                                         -4-\n\fYoungs threatened LeVine with a conduct violation and that LeVine did not consent\nto be catheterized. The district court granted the motions, concluding that defendants\nwere entitled to qualified immunity from LeVine’s Fourth Amendment claims and did\nnot violate his Eighth Amendment rights. This appeal followed.\n\n                           II. Fourth Amendment Claims\n\n       LeVine first argues that the district court erred in granting defendants qualified\nimmunity on his Fourth Amendment claims “because the right of a prisoner to be free\nfrom an involuntary catheterization as part of random drug testing” was clearly\nestablished at the time he was required to undergo this procedure.

We agree\nwith two principles on which this argument is premised.

Spence did not involve use of the more intrusive\nprocedure of involuntary catheterization to obtain a urine sample. That procedure was\nat issue in Sparks v. Stutler, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">948</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1996), where prison officials ordered an inmate catheterized after they found a\nsyringe in his shoe and he failed to provide a urine sample. The Seventh Circuit\ndescribed catheterization as “more intrusive than a needle but less intrusive than a\nscalpel, making it hard to classify . . . under an objective reasonableness inquiry.” Id.\nat 261. Without concluding whether a Fourth Amendment violation had occurred, the\ncourt reversed the district court’s denial of qualified immunity. In Sparks, there was\nreasonable suspicion of drug use, a factor not present in this case. In another group\nof cases, exemplified by Tinius v. Carroll County Sheriff Dept., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2411147\"><a href=\"/opinion/2411147/tinius-v-carroll-county-sheriff-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1070, 1074-76 (N.D. Ia. 2004), courts have held that involuntary catheterization to\nobtain a urine sample for medical purposes -- such as determining the proper course\nof treatment -- does not violate the Fourth Amendment. Relying on these cases,\ndefendants argue that LeVine’s Fourth Amendment rights were not violated even if\nhe was involuntarily catheterized to obtain a urine sample for a random drug test. We\nneed not accept that argument to decide this case.\n\n       The district court rejected defendants’ categorical argument and concluded that\ncorrectional officer Youngs violated LeVine’s Fourth Amendment rights because\n“involuntary catheterization of a 68-year-old man with a history of prostate problems,\nas part of a random drug screening and without suspicion, is unreasonable” when\nother less intrusive options are available, such as keeping LeVine in a room until he\nwas able to urinate. The court then granted Youngs qualified immunity because “the\nlaw of the Eighth Circuit was not clearly established at the time of [her] actions.”\n\n       In Saucier v. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (2001), the Supreme Court held that, in\ndeciding an issue of qualified immunity, a court must first consider a “threshold\nquestion”: “[t]aken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the\nfacts alleged show the officer’s conduct violated a constitutional right?” If so, then\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthe court turns to the question whether the right was clearly established at the time in\nquestion. In recent cases, four Justices have urged that Saucier’s rigid “order of\nbattle” be overruled. See Brosseau v. Haugen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137736\"><a href=\"/opinion/137736/brosseau-v-haugen/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201 (2004) (Breyer, J.,\njoined by Scalia and Ginsburg, JJ., concurring); Bunting v.

In Scott v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145738\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That concern is present in this\ncase, because the district court has posited a constitutional right that is both\nunprecedented in prior cases and so far removed from a plausible interpretation of the\nfacts that it appears to be an impermissible advisory opinion. We need not resolve the\ndilemma, however, because the court’s constitutional ruling depended upon an\nassumed fact for which there is no support in the record. Accordingly, applying the\nSaucier order of battle, we conclude that no constitutional violation has been shown\nwithout considering or approving the constitutional right posited by the district court.\n\n      The critical fact assumed by the district court was that correctional officer\nYoungs ordered the prison’s medical professionals to perform an involuntary\ncatheterization. Absent this fact, the record viewed most favorably to LeVine shows\nthat Youngs threatened or warned LeVine that he would be subject to discipline for\nbeing unable to produce a urine specimen, which was consistent with § III.B.4 of the\nDepartment’s drug testing policy. When LeVine could not provide a sample, Youngs\ncould have returned him to his cell, written up his failure, and left to others the\n\n      3\n       In granting certiorari in Pearson v. Callahan, No. 07-751 (Mar. 24, 2008), the\nCourt directed the parties to brief and argue an additional question, “Whether the\nCourt’s decision in Saucier . . . should be overruled.” The Court heard argument in\nPearson on October 14, 2008.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fultimate question of discipline. Instead, after learning of his enlarged prostate from\nLeVine and the medical staff, Youngs directed correctional officer Dunlap to take\nLeVine to the medical unit for catheterization, a procedure LeVine had undergone\ntwice before when he “couldn’t urinate.” LeVine’s complaint and deposition\ntestimony alleged, not that he refused the procedure, but that his consent or\nacquiescence was induced by the threat of prison discipline. But even if Youngs\nordered LeVine to go to the medical unit, she had no contact with the medical\nprofessionals after he arrived and no authority to direct those professionals to\nundertake the catheterization procedure if they thought it medically inappropriate or\nif patient LeVine refused to consent. LeVine did not sue Officer Dunlap and makes\nno claim that he ordered the medical professionals to undertake the catheterization, an\naction that would have been beyond Dunlap’s knowledge and authority. Liability for\ndamages under § 1983 is personal. Doran v. Eckold, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790454\"><a href=\"/opinion/790454/david-doran-v-dennis-eckold-in-his-official-capacity-as-president-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 965 (8th Cir.\n2005) (en banc). The district court erred in concluding that Youngs violated LeVine’s\nFourth Amendment rights because LeVine presented no evidence that Youngs was\npersonally responsible for any involuntary catheterization that occurred.\n\n       The district court concluded that the actions of nurses Roebuck and Greim as\nmedical staff were objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law because\nthey “were simply following a request from Youngs.” Citing Sparks and Spence,\nLeVine argues that these nurses “were aware, or minimally should be aware, that an\ninvoluntary catheterization for a non-medical purpose is against a prisoner’s 4th\nAmendment rights.” But that proposition was not clearly established by those cases,\nor by any other. Given the undisputed evidence that LeVine had undergone voluntary\ncatheterization in the past when he was unable to urinate, and that the nurses used\nproper technique in attempting this rather common and safe though painful procedure,\nthe grant of qualified immunity must be upheld. See Sparks, 71 F.3d at 261.\n\n     LeVine further argues that the district court erred in granting summary\njudgment on his Fourth Amendment claims because Roebuck and Greim initially\n\n                                         -8-\n\fsought summary judgment only on his Eighth Amendment claims. We disagree. The\nnurses’ motion for summary judgment interpreted LeVine’s ambiguous pro se\ncomplaint as asserting only an Eighth Amendment claim regarding their medical\ntreatment. When LeVine’s response clarified that he was asserting Fourth\nAmendment claims against all defendants, Roebuck and Greim addressed the Fourth\nAmendment claims in their reply memorandum. The district court construed the\ncomplaint as adequately stating Fourth Amendment claims against the nurses and\nresolved this fully briefed issue, which was well within its discretion.\n\n                          III. Eighth Amendment Claims\n\n       In the district court, LeVine’s summary judgment memorandum clarified that\nhe was asserting Eighth Amendment claims for defendants’ alleged brutality, rather\nthan for their deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.4 The standard for\nan Eighth Amendment brutality claim is whether force was applied “maliciously and\nsadistically for the very purpose of causing him.” Berryhill v. Schriro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"751888\"><a href=\"/opinion/751888/cortez-berryhill-v-dora-schriro-george-lombardi-kelly-lock-larry/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1076 (8th Cir. 1998). The district court granted summary judgment dismissing these\nclaims, concluding there is no evidence that any defendant used force maliciously and\nsadistically for the purpose of causing LeVine harm. We agree. “One acts\nmaliciously by undertaking, without just cause or reason, a course of action intended\nto injure another” and “sadistically by engaging in extreme or excessive cruelty or by\ndelighting in cruelty.” Howard v. Barnett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"667632\"><a href=\"/opinion/667632/keith-howard-v-co-ii-barnett-cco-i-johnson-co-i-malone/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872 (8th Cir. 1994)\n\n      4\n       The record does not reveal a viable claim of deliberate indifference. Dr.\nFarnham submitted an affidavit averring that difficulty inserting a catheter into the\nbladder of a man with an enlarged prostate is not uncommon, that the nurses used\nproper technique in attempting to catheterize LeVine, and that it was proper medical\ntreatment to successfully catheterize LeVine at the hospital and then leave the catheter\nin place for several days to allow his injury to heal. LeVine submitted no evidence\nor expert opinion to the contrary.\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f(quotations omitted). In his deposition, LeVine admitted that defendants acted for the\nlegitimate purpose of obtaining a urine sample for a random drug test. He asserted\nthat Roebuck “didn’t know what she was doing,” but not that she was attempting to\nhurt him. He complained that Youngs threatened him with a conduct violation if he\ndid not provide a sample. These allegations fall far short of raising a genuine issue\nof material fact as to whether the defendants acted with a sufficiently culpable state\nof mind to support an Eighth Amendment brutality claim.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n                     ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f</pre>",
