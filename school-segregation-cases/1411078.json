Otter, 14-35420/35421, and reversed the district court’s\njudgment in Sevcik v. Sandoval, 12-17668, in suits brought by\nsame-sex couples who live in Idaho and Nevada and wish\neither to marry there or to have marriages entered into\nelsewhere recognized in their home states.\n\n    Both Idaho and Nevada passed statutes and enacted\nconstitutional amendments preventing same-sex couples from\nmarrying and refusing to recognize same-sex marriages\nvalidly performed elsewhere. The panel held that the Idaho\nand Nevada laws at issue violate the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment because they deny lesbians and\ngays who wish to marry persons of the same sex a right they\nafford to individuals who wish to marry persons of the\nopposite sex, and do not satisfy the heightened scrutiny\nstandard the Court adopted in SmithKline Beecham Corp. v.\nAbbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471 (9th Cir. 2014).\n\n    In the Nevada case, Sevcik v. Sandoval, the panel held\nthat a case or controversy still existed, even though the\nNevada state governor and clerk recorder had declined to\ncontinue pursuing the appeal. The panel also held that it was\nnot precluded from hearing the appeal by Baker v. Nelson,\n409 U.S. 810 (1972), because the case presented substantial\nfederal questions. The panel stated that it would consider the\n\n  **\n     This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

OTTER\n\nbriefs and oral argument offered by the Nevada intervenor,\nthe Coalition for the Protection of Marriage.\n\n    In remanding Sevcik v. Sandoval, the panel instructed the\ndistrict court to promptly issue an injunction permanently\nenjoining the state from enforcing any constitutional\nprovision, statute, regulation or policy preventing otherwise\nqualified same-sex couples from marrying, or denying\nrecognition to marriages celebrated in other jurisdictions\nwhich, if the spouses were not of the same sex, would be\nvalid under the laws of the state.\n\n    Concurring, Judge Reinhardt wrote separately only to\nexplain his view that the same-sex marriage bans invalidated\nalso implicated plaintiffs’ substantive due process rights.\n\n    Concurring, Judge Berzon agreed that Idaho and\nNevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions fail because they\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. Judge Berzon\nwrote separately because she was persuaded that Idaho and\nNevada’s same-sex marriage bans are also unconstitutional\nfor another reason: They are classifications on the basis of\ngender that do not survive the level of scrutiny applicable to\nsuch classifications.\n\n\n                        COUNSEL\n\nLawrence G.

Art.

Stat. § 122.020(1) (“[A] male and female person\n. . . may be joined in marriage.”).\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                              19\n\nor to have marriages entered into elsewhere recognized in\ntheir home states, have sued for declaratory relief and to\nenjoin the enforcement of these laws. They argue that the\nlaws are subject to heightened scrutiny because they deprive\nplaintiffs of the fundamental due process right to marriage,\nand because they deny them equal protection of the law by\ndiscriminating against them on the bases of their sexual\norientation and their sex. In response, Governor Otter,\nRecorder Rich, and the State of Idaho, along with the Nevada\nintervenors, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage (“the\nCoalition”), argue that their laws survive heightened scrutiny,\nprimarily because the states have a compelling interest in\nsending a message of support for the institution of opposite-\nsex marriage. They argue that permitting same-sex marriage\nwill seriously undermine this message, and contend that the\ninstitution of opposite-sex marriage is important because it\nencourages people who procreate to be responsible parents,\nand because opposite-sex parents are better for children than\nsame-sex parents.\n\n    Without the benefit of our decision in SmithKline\nBeecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471 (9th Cir. 2014),\nreh’g en banc denied, 759 F.3d 990 (9th Cir. 2014), the\nSevcik district court applied rational basis review and upheld\nNevada’s laws. Sevcik v. Sandoval, 911 F. Supp. 2d 996 (D.\nNev. 2012). After we decided SmithKline, the Latta district\ncourt concluded that heightened scrutiny applied to Idaho’s\nlaws because they discriminated based on sexual orientation,\nand invalidated them.2 Latta v. Otter, No. 1:13-CV-00482-\n\n\n   2\n     The Latta court also found a due process violation because, it\nconcluded, the laws curtailed plaintiffs’ fundamental right to marry. Latta\nv. Otter, No. 1:13-CV-00482-CWD, 2014 WL 1909999, at *9–13 (D.\nIdaho May 13, 2014).\n\f20                        LATTA V. OTTER\n\nCWD, 2014 WL 1909999, at *14–18 (D. Idaho May 13,\n2014). We hold that the Idaho and Nevada laws at issue\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment because they deny lesbians and gays3 who wish\nto marry persons of the same sex a right they afford to\nindividuals who wish to marry persons of the opposite sex,\nand do not satisfy the heightened scrutiny standard we\nadopted in SmithKline.\n\n                                   I.\n\n    Before we reach the merits, we must address two\npreliminary matters: first, whether an Article III case or\ncontroversy still exists in Sevcik, since Nevada’s government\nofficials have ceased to defend their laws’ constitutionality;\nand second, whether the Supreme Court’s summary dismissal\nin Baker v. Nelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), is controlling\nprecedent that precludes us from considering plaintiffs’\nclaims.\n\n                                   A.\n\n    Governor Sandoval and Clerk-Recorder Glover initially\ndefended Nevada’s laws in the district court. However, they\nhave since withdrawn their answering briefs from\nconsideration by this Court, in light of our decision in\nSmithKline, 740 F.3d at 480–81 (holding heightened scrutiny\n\n\n 3\n   We have recognized that “[s]exual orientation and sexual identity are\nimmutable; they are so fundamental to one’s identity that a person should\nnot be required to abandon them.” Hernandez-Montiel v. I.N.S., 225 F.3d\n1084, 1093 (9th Cir. 2000), overruled on other grounds by Thomas v.\nGonzales, 409 F.3d 1177, 1187 (9th Cir. 2005), vacated, 547 U.S. 183\n(2006).\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                         21\n\napplicable). Governor Sandoval now asserts that United\nStates v. Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (2013), “signifies that\ndiscrimination against same-sex couples is unconstitutional,”\nand that “[a]ny uncertainty regarding the interpretation of\nWindsor was . . . dispelled” by SmithKline. As a result, we\nhave not considered those briefs, and the Governor and Clerk-\nRecorder were not heard at oral argument, pursuant to Fed. R.\nApp. P. 31(c).\n\n     The Nevada Governor and Clerk Recorder remain parties,\nhowever, and continue to enforce the laws at issue on the\nbasis of a judgment in their favor below. As a result, we are\nstill presented with a live case or controversy in need of\nresolution. Despite the fact that Nevada “largely agree[s] with\nthe opposing party on the merits of the controversy, there is\nsufficient adverseness and an adequate basis for jurisdiction\nin the fact the [state] intend[s] to enforce the challenged law\nagainst that party.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2686–87 (citation\nand quotation marks omitted). Although the state defendants\nwithdrew their briefs, we are required to ascertain and rule on\nthe merits arguments in the case, rather than ruling\nautomatically in favor of plaintiffs-appellants. See Carvalho\nv. Equifax Info. Servs., LLC, 629 F.3d 876, 887 n.7 (9th Cir.\n2010) (“[Defendant’s] failure to file a brief does not compel\na ruling in [plaintiff’s] favor, given that the only sanction for\nfailure to file an answering brief is forfeiture of oral\nargument.”).\n\n    There remains a question of identifying the appropriate\nparties to the case before us—specifically, whether we should\nconsider the arguments put forward by the Nevada intervenor,\nthe Coalition for the Protection of Marriage. As plaintiffs\nconsented to their intervention in the district court—at a point\nin the litigation before Governor Sandoval and Clerk-\n\f22                       LATTA V. OTTER\n\nRecorder Glover indicated that they would no longer argue in\nsupport of the laws—and continue to so consent, the propriety\nof the intervenor’s participation has never been adjudicated.\n\n    Because the state defendants have withdrawn their merits\nbriefs, we face a situation akin to that in Windsor. There, a\ncase or controversy remained between Windsor and the\nUnited States, which agreed with her that the Defense of\nMarriage Act was unconstitutional but nonetheless refused to\nrefund the estate tax she had paid. Here as there, the state\ndefendants’ “agreement with [plaintiffs’] legal argument\nraises the risk that instead of a real, earnest and vital\ncontroversy, the Court faces a friendly, non-adversary\nproceeding . . . .” 133 S. Ct. at 2687 (citations and quotation\nmarks omitted). Hearing from the Coalition helps us “to\nassure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the\npresentation of issues upon which the court so largely\ndepends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.”\nBaker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962). As a result, we\nconsider the briefs and oral argument offered by the\nCoalition, which, Governor Sandoval believes, “canvass the\narguments against the Appellants’ position and the related\npolicy considerations.”4\n\n                                  B.\n\n    Defendants argue that we are precluded from hearing this\ncase by Baker, 409 U.S. 810. In that case, the Minnesota\n\n\n  4\n     For the sake of convenience, we refer throughout this opinion to\narguments advanced generally by “defendants”; by this we mean the\nparties that continue actively to argue in defense of the laws—the Idaho\ndefendants and the Nevada intervenor—and not Governor Sandoval and\nClerk-Recorder Glover.\n\f                          LATTA V. OTTER                              23\n\nSupreme Court had rejected due process and equal protection\nchallenges to a state law limiting marriage to a man and a\nwoman. 191 N.W.2d 185, 186–87 (Minn. 1971). The United\nStates Supreme Court summarily dismissed an appeal from\nthat decision “for want of a substantial federal question.”\nBaker, 409 U.S. at 810. Such summary dismissals “prevent\nlower courts from coming to opposite conclusions on the\nprecise issues presented and necessarily decided by those\nactions,” Mandel v. Bradley, 432 U.S. 173, 176 (1977) (per\ncuriam), until “doctrinal developments indicate otherwise,”\nHicks v. Miranda, 422 U.S. 332, 343–44 (1975) (citation and\nquotation marks omitted). Defendants contend that this\ndecades-old case is still good law, and therefore bars us from\nconcluding that same-sex couples have a due process or equal\nprotection right to marriage.\n\n    However, “subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court”\nnot only “suggest” but make clear that the claims before us\npresent substantial federal questions.5 Wright v. Lane Cnty.\nDist. Ct., 647 F.2d 940, 941 (9th Cir. 1981); see Windsor,\n133 S.

Windsor, 133 S.

The Court did not reach the\nquestion we decide here because it was not presented to it. Although these\ncases did not tell us the answers to the federal questions before us,\nWindsor and Lawrence make clear that these are substantial federal\nquestions we, as federal judges, must hear and decide.\n\f24                     LATTA V.

Three\nother circuits have issued opinions striking down laws like\nthose at issue here since Windsor, and all agree that Baker no\nlonger precludes review. Accord Baskin v.

Herbert, 755 F.3d 1193, 1204–08 (10th Cir. 2014).\nAs any observer of the Supreme Court cannot help but\nrealize, this case and others like it present not only substantial\nbut pressing federal questions.\n\n                               II.\n\n     Plaintiffs are ordinary Idahoans and Nevadans. One\nteaches deaf children. Another is a warehouse manager. A\nthird is an historian. Most are parents. Like all human beings,\ntheir lives are given greater meaning by their intimate, loving,\ncommitted relationships with their partners and children.\n“The common vocabulary of family life and belonging that\nother[s] [] may take for granted” is, as the Idaho plaintiffs put\nit, denied to them—as are all of the concrete legal rights,\nresponsibilities, and financial benefits afforded opposite-sex\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                                25\n\nmarried couples by state and federal law6—merely because of\ntheir sexual orientation.\n\n    Defendants argue that their same-sex marriage bans do\nnot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, but rather\non the basis of procreative capacity. Effectively if not\nexplicitly, they assert that while these laws may disadvantage\nsame-sex couples and their children, heightened scrutiny is\nnot appropriate because differential treatment by sexual\norientation is an incidental effect of, but not the reason for,\n\n\n  6\n     Nevada, unlike Idaho, has enacted a domestic partnership regime.\nSince 2009, both same-sex and opposite-sex couples have been allowed\nto register as domestic partners. Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 122A.100, 122A.010\net seq. Domestic partners are generally treated like married couples for\npurposes of rights and responsibilities—including with respect to\nchildren—under state law. However, domestic partners are denied nearly\nall of the benefits afforded married couples under federal law—including,\nsince Windsor, same-sex couples married under state law.\n\n     The fact that Nevada has seen fit to give same-sex couples the\nopportunity to enjoy the benefits afforded married couples by state law\nmakes its case for the constitutionality of its regime even weaker than\nIdaho’s. With the concrete differences in treatment gone, all that is left is\na message of disfavor. The Supreme Court has “repeatedly emphasized\n[that] discrimination itself, by perpetuating ‘archaic and stereotypic\nnotions’ or by stigmatizing members of the disfavored group as ‘innately\ninferior’ and therefore as less worthy participants,” can cause serious\n“injuries to those who are denied equal treatment solely because of their\nmembership in a disfavored group.” Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728,\n739–40 (1984) (citation omitted).\n\n     If Nevada were concerned, as the Coalition purports it to be, that state\nrecognition of same-sex unions would make the institution of marriage\n“genderless” and thereby undermine opposite-sex spouses’ commitments\nto each other and their children, it would be ill-advised to permit opposite-\nsex couples to participate in the alternative domestic partnership regime\nit has established. However, Nevada does just that.\n\f26                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nthose laws. However, the laws at issue distinguish on their\nface between opposite-sex couples, who are permitted to\nmarry and whose out-of-state marriages are recognized, and\nsame-sex couples, who are not permitted to marry and whose\nmarriages are not recognized. Whether facial discrimination\nexists “does not depend on why” a policy discriminates, “but\nrather on the explicit terms of the discrimination.” Int’l\nUnion, United Auto., Aerospace & Agr. Implement Workers\nof Am., UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199\n(1991). Hence, while the procreative capacity distinction that\ndefendants seek to draw could in theory represent a\njustification for the discrimination worked by the laws, it\ncannot overcome the inescapable conclusion that Idaho and\nNevada do discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n    In SmithKline, we held that classifications on the basis of\nsexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny. 740 F.3d\nat 474. We explained:\n\n        In its words and its deed, Windsor established\n        a level of scrutiny for classifications based on\n        sexual orientation that is unquestionably\n        higher than rational basis review. In other\n        words, Windsor requires that heightened\n        scrutiny be applied to equal protection claims\n        involving sexual orientation.\n\nId. at 481.\n\n   Windsor, we reasoned, applied heightened scrutiny in\nconsidering not the Defense of Marriage Act’s hypothetical\n\f                           LATTA V.

We also noted that Windsor declined to\nadopt the strong presumption in favor of constitutionality and\nthe heavy deference to legislative judgments characteristic of\nrational basis review. Id. at 483. We concluded:\n\n         Windsor requires that when state action\n         discriminates on the basis of sexual\n         orientation, we must examine its actual\n         purposes and carefully consider the resulting\n         inequality to ensure that our most\n         fundamental institutions neither send nor\n         reinforce messages of stigma or second-class\n         status.\n\nId.\n\n    We proceed by applying the law of our circuit regarding\nthe applicable level of scrutiny. Because Idaho and Nevada’s\nlaws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, that level\nis heightened scrutiny.\n\n                                    III.\n\n    Defendants argue that their marriage laws survive\nheightened scrutiny because they promote child welfare by\n\n  7\n    Although as discussed in the text, SmithKline instructs us to consider\nthe states’ actual reasons, and not post-hoc justifications, for enacting the\nlaws at issue, these actual reasons are hard to ascertain in this case. Some\nof the statutory and constitutional provisions before us were enacted by\nstate legislatures and some were enacted by voters, and we have been\ninformed by all parties that the legislative histories are sparse. We shall\nassume, therefore, that the justifications offered in defendants’ briefs were\nin fact the actual motivations for the laws.\n\f28                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\nencouraging optimal parenting. Governor Otter argues that\nsame-sex marriage “teaches everyone—married and\nunmarried, gay and straight, men and women, and all the\nchildren—that a child knowing and being reared by her\nmother and father is neither socially preferred nor officially\nencouraged.” Governor Otter seeks to have the state send the\nopposite message to all Idahoans: that a child reared by its\nbiological parents is socially preferred and officially\nencouraged.\n\n    This argument takes two related forms: First, defendants\nmake a “procreative channeling” argument: that the norms of\nopposite-sex marriage ensure that as many children as\npossible are raised by their married biological mothers and\nfathers. They claim that same-sex marriage will undermine\nthose existing norms, which encourage people in opposite-sex\nrelationships to place their children’s interests above their\nown and preserve intact family units, instead of pursuing their\nown emotional and sexual needs elsewhere. In short, they\nargue that allowing same-sex marriages will adversely affect\nopposite-sex marriage by reducing its appeal to heterosexuals,\nand will reduce the chance that accidental pregnancy will lead\nto marriage. Second, Governor Otter and the Coalition (but\nnot the state of Idaho) argue that limiting marriage to\nopposite-sex couples promotes child welfare because children\nare most likely to thrive if raised by two parents of opposite\nsexes, since, they assert, mothers and fathers have\n“complementary” approaches to parenting.8 Thus, they\n\n\n\n 8\n   These arguments are not novel. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group\n(BLAG) relied in part on similar contentions about procreative channeling\nand gender complementarity in its attempt to justify the federal Defense\nof Marriage Act, but the Court did not credit them.

OTTER                        29\n\ncontend, children raised by opposite-sex couples receive a\nbetter upbringing.\n\n                              A.\n\n    We pause briefly before considering the substance of\ndefendants’ arguments to address the contention that their\nconclusions about the future effects of same-sex marriage on\nparenting are legislative facts entitled to deference.\nDefendants have not demonstrated that the Idaho and Nevada\nlegislatures actually found the facts asserted in their briefs;\neven if they had, deference would not be warranted.\n\n    Unsupported legislative conclusions as to whether\nparticular policies will have societal effects of the sort at\nissue in this case—determinations which often, as here,\nimplicate constitutional rights—have not been afforded\ndeference by the Court. To the contrary, we “retain[] an\nindependent constitutional duty to review factual findings\nwhere constitutional rights are at stake. . . . Uncritical\ndeference to [legislatures’] factual findings in these cases is\ninappropriate.” Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 165–66\n(2007); see also Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417,\n450–55 (1990).\n\n                              B.\n\n    Marriage, the Coalition argues, is an “institution directed\nto certain great social tasks, with many of those involving a\nman and a woman united in the begetting, rearing, and\neducation of children”; it is being “torn away,” they claim,\n\n\nRespondent BLAG at 44–49, Windsor, 133 S. Ct. 2675 (No. 12-307),\n2013 U.S. S. Ct. Briefs LEXIS 280 at *74–82.\n\f30                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\n“from its ancient social purposes and transformed into a\ngovernment-endorsed celebration of the private desires of two\nadults (regardless of gender) to unite their lives sexually,\nemotionally, and socially for as long as those personal desires\nlast.” Defendants struggle, however, to identify any means by\nwhich same-sex marriages will undermine these social\npurposes. They argue vehemently that same-sex marriage will\nharm existing and especially future opposite-sex couples and\ntheir children because the message communicated by the\nsocial institution of marriage will be lost.\n\n    As one of the Nevada plaintiffs’ experts testified, there is\nno empirical support for the idea that legalizing same-sex\nmarriage would harm—or indeed, affect—opposite-sex\nmarriages or relationships. That expert presented data from\nMassachusetts, a state which has permitted same-sex\nmarriage since 2004, showing no decrease in marriage rates\nor increase in divorce rates in the past decade.9 See Amicus\nBrief of Massachusetts et al. 23–27; see also Amicus Brief of\nAmerican Psychological Association et al. 8–13. It would\nseem that allowing couples who want to marry so badly that\nthey have endured years of litigation to win the right to do so\nwould reaffirm the state’s endorsement, without reservation,\nof spousal and parental commitment. From which aspect of\nsame-sex marriages, then, will opposite-sex couples intuit the\n\n\n\n 9\n   The Coalition takes issue with this conclusion, arguing that the effects\nof same-sex marriage might not manifest themselves for decades, because\n“something as massive and pervasive in our society and humanity as the\nman-woman marriage institution, like a massive ocean-going ship, does\nnot stop or turn in a short space or a short time.” Given that the\ndiscriminatory impact on individuals because of their sexual orientation\nis so harmful to them and their families, such unsupported speculation\ncannot justify the indefinite continuation of that discrimination.\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        31\n\ndestructive message defendants fear? Defendants offer only\nunpersuasive suggestions.\n\n    First, they argue that since same-sex families will not\ninclude both a father and a mother, a man who has a child\nwith a woman will conclude that his involvement in that\nchild’s life is not essential. They appear to contend that such\na father will see a child being raised by two women and\ndeduce that because the state has said it is unnecessary for\nthat child—who has two parents—to have a father, it is also\nunnecessary for his child to have a father. This proposition\nreflects a crass and callous view of parental love and the\nparental bond that is not worthy of response. We reject it out\nof hand. Accord Kitchen, 755 F.3d at 1223 (concluding that\nit was “wholly illogical” to think that same-sex marriage\nwould affect opposite-sex couples’ choices); Windsor v.\nUnited States, 699 F.3d 169, 188 (2d Cir. 2012); Golinski v.\nOffice of Pers. Mgmt., 824 F. Supp. 2d 968, 998 (N.D. Cal.\n2012); Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F. Supp. 2d 921, 972\n(N.D. Cal. 2010).\n\n    Defendants also propose another possible means by which\nendorsing same-sex marriage could discourage opposite-sex\nmarriage, albeit less explicitly: opposite-sex couples who\ndisapprove of same-sex marriage will opt less frequently or\nenthusiastically to participate in an institution that allows\nsame-sex couples to participate. However, the fear that an\nestablished institution will be undermined due to private\nopposition to its inclusive shift is not a legitimate basis for\nretaining the status quo. In United States v. Virginia, the\nCourt explained:\n\n       The notion that admission of women would\n       downgrade VMI’s stature, destroy the\n\f32                       LATTA V. OTTER\n\n         adversative system and, with it, even the\n         school, is a judgment hardly proved, a\n         prediction hardly different from other “self-\n         fulfilling prophec[ies],” see Mississippi Univ.\n         for Women [v.

Private biases\nmay be outside the reach of the law, but the law cannot,\ndirectly or indirectly, give them effect.”). The Sevcik district\n\n\n  10\n     Likewise, Governor Otter assures us that Idaho’s laws were not\nmotivated by judgments about the relative emotional commitments of\nsame-sex and opposite-sex couples; his argument is about an “ethos,” he\nclaims, and so is not weakened by the fact that same-sex couples may, as\nhe admits, be just as child-oriented.\n\f                          LATTA V. OTTER                              33\n\ncourt thus erred in crediting the argument that “a meaningful\npercentage of heterosexual persons would cease to value the\ncivil institution as highly as they previously had and hence\nenter it less frequently . . . because they no longer wish to be\nassociated with the civil institution as redefined,” both\nbecause defendants failed to produce any support for that\nprediction, and because private disapproval is a categorically\ninadequate justification for public injustice. Sevcik, 911 F.\nSupp. 2d at 1016.\n\n    Same-sex marriage, Governor Otter asserts, is part of a\nshift towards a consent-based, personal relationship model of\nmarriage, which is more adult-centric and less child-centric.11\nThe Latta district court was correct in concluding, however,\nthat “marriage in Idaho is and has long been a designedly\nconsent-based institution. . . . Idaho law is wholly indifferent\nto whether a heterosexual couple wants to marry because they\nshare this vision” of conjugal marriage. Latta, 2014 WL\n1909999, at *23.\n\n    Idaho focuses on another aspect of the procreative\nchanneling claim. Because opposite-sex couples can\naccidentally conceive (and women may choose not to\nterminate unplanned pregnancies), so the argument goes,\nmarriage is important because it serves to bind such couples\ntogether and to their children. This makes some sense.\nDefendants’ argument runs off the rails, however, when they\n\n\n 11\n    He also states, in conclusory fashion, that allowing same-sex marriage\nwill lead opposite-sex couples to abuse alcohol and drugs, engage in\nextramarital affairs, take on demanding work schedules, and participate in\ntime-consuming hobbies. We seriously doubt that allowing committed\nsame-sex couples to settle down in legally recognized marriages will drive\nopposite-sex couples to sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll.\n\f34                           LATTA V. OTTER\n\nsuggest that marriage’s stabilizing and unifying force is\nunnecessary for same-sex couples, because they always\nchoose to conceive or adopt a child.12 As they themselves\nacknowledge, marriage not only brings a couple together at\nthe initial moment of union; it helps to keep them together,\n“from [that] day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for\npoorer, in sickness and in health.” Raising children is hard;\nmarriage supports same-sex couples in parenting their\nchildren, just as it does opposite-sex couples.\n\n    Moreover, marriage is not simply about procreation, but\nas much about\n\n           expressions of emotional support and public\n           commitment . . . . [M]any religions recognize\n           marriage as having spiritual significance; . . .\n\n 12\n      As Judge Richard Posner put it, bluntly:\n\n           [These states] think[] that straight couples tend to be\n           sexually irresponsible, producing unwanted children by\n           the carload, and so must be pressured . . . to marry, but\n           that gay couples, unable as they are to produce children\n           wanted or unwanted, are model parents—model\n           citizens really—so have no need for marriage.\n           Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing\n           unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to\n           marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted\n           children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry.\n           Go figure.\n\nBaskin, 2014 WL 4359059, at *10 (7th Cir. Sept. 4, 2014).\n\n    Idaho and Nevada’s laws are both over- and under-inclusive with\nrespect to parental fitness. A man and a woman who have been convicted\nof abusing their children are allowed to marry; same-sex partners who\nhave been adjudicated to be fit parents in an adoption proceeding are not.\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                         35\n\n        therefore, the commitment of marriage may\n        be an exercise of religious faith as well as an\n        expression of personal dedication . . . .\n        [M]arital status often is a precondition to the\n        receipt of government benefits (e. g., Social\n        Security benefits), property rights (e. g.,\n        tenancy by the entirety, inheritance rights),\n        and other, less tangible benefits (e. g.,\n        legitimation of children born out of wedlock).\n\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95–96 (1987) (recognizing that\nprisoners, too, enjoyed the right to marry, even though they\nwere not allowed to have sex, and even if they did not already\nhave children).\n\n    Although many married couples have children, marriage\nis at its essence an “association that promotes . . . a bilateral\nloyalty, not commercial or social projects.” Griswold v.\nConnecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 486 (1965) (recognizing that\nmarried couples have a privacy right to use contraception in\norder to prevent procreation). Just as “it would demean a\nmarried couple were it to be said marriage is simply about the\nright to have sexual intercourse,” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 567,\nit demeans married couples—especially those who are\nchildless—to say that marriage is simply about the capacity\nto procreate.\n\n    Additionally, as plaintiffs argue persuasively, Idaho and\nNevada’s laws are grossly over- and under-inclusive with\nrespect to procreative capacity. Both states give marriage\nlicenses to many opposite-sex couples who cannot or will not\nreproduce—as Justice Scalia put it, in dissent, “the sterile and\nthe elderly are allowed to marry,” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at\n\f36                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\n604–05—but not to same-sex couples who already have\nchildren or are in the process of having or adopting them.13\n\n    A few of Idaho and Nevada’s other laws, if altered, would\ndirectly increase the number of children raised by their\nmarried biological parents. We mention them to illustrate, by\ncontrast, just how tenuous any potential connection between\na ban on same-sex marriage and defendants’ asserted aims is.\nFor that reason alone, laws so poorly tailored as those before\nus cannot survive heightened scrutiny.\n\n    If defendants really wished to ensure that as many\nchildren as possible had married parents, they would do well\nto rescind the right to no-fault divorce, or to divorce\naltogether. Neither has done so. Such reforms might face\nconstitutional difficulties of their own, but they would at least\nfurther the states’ asserted interest in solidifying marriage.\nLikewise, if Idaho and Nevada want to increase the\npercentage of children being raised by their two biological\nparents, they might do better to ban assisted reproduction\nusing donor sperm or eggs, gestational surrogacy, and\nadoption, by both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, as well\nas by single people. Neither state does. See Idaho Code\n§§ 39-5401 et seq.; Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 122A.200(1)(d),\n126.051(1)(a), 126.510 et seq., 127.040; see also Carla\nSpivack, The Law of Surrogate Motherhood in the United\n\n\n\n     13\n         Defendants acknowledge this, but argue that it would be\nunconstitutionally intrusive to determine procreative capacity or intent for\nopposite-sex couples, and that the states must therefore paint with a broad\nbrush to ensure that any couple that could possibly procreate can marry.\nHowever, Idaho and Nevada grant the right to marry even to those whose\ninability to procreate is obvious, such as the elderly.\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                              37\n\nStates, 58 Am. J. Comp. L. 97, 102 & n.15 (2010); Idaho is\na destination for surrogacy, KTVB.com (Dec. 5, 2013).\n\n    In extending the benefits of marriage only to people who\nhave the capacity to procreate, while denying those same\nbenefits to people who already have children, Idaho and\nNevada materially harm and demean same-sex couples and\ntheir children.14 Windsor, 133 S. Ct. at 2694. Denying\nchildren resources and stigmatizing their families on this\nbasis is “illogical and unjust.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202,\n220 (1982) (citation omitted). It is counterproductive, and it\nis unconstitutional.\n\n                                    C.\n\n    Governor Otter and the Coalition, but not the state of\nIdaho, also argue that children should be raised by both a\nmale parent and a female parent. They assert that their\nmarriage laws have “recognized, valorized and made\nnormative the roles of ‘mother’ and ‘father’ and their uniting,\ncomplementary roles in raising their offspring,” and insist\nthat allowing same-sex couples to marry would send the\n\n\n\n 14\n    Idaho attempts to rebut testimony by the Idaho plaintiffs’ expert that\nchildren of unmarried same-sex couples do just as well as those of married\nopposite-sex couples; the state mistakenly argues that this evidence shows\nthat the children of same-sex couples are not harmed when the state\nwithholds from their parents the right to marry. A more likely explanation\nfor this expert’s findings is that when same-sex couples raise children,\nwhether adopted or conceived through the use of assisted reproductive\ntechnology, they have necessarily chosen to assume the financial,\ntemporal, and emotional obligations of parenthood. This does not lead,\nhowever, to the conclusion that these children, too, would not benefit from\ntheir parents’ marriage, just as children with opposite-sex parents do.\n\f38                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nmessage that “men and women are interchangeable [and that\na] child does not need a mother and a father.”\n\n    However, as we explained in SmithKline, Windsor\n“forbid[s] state action from ‘denoting the inferiority’” of\nsame-sex couples. 740 F.3d at 482 (citing Brown v. Bd. of\nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 494 (1954)).\n\n        It is the identification of such a class by the\n        law for a separate and lesser public status that\n        “make[s] them unequal.” Windsor, 133 S. Ct.\n        at 2694. DOMA was “practically a brand\n        upon them, affixed by the law, an assertion of\n        their inferiority.” Strauder v. West Virginia,\n        100 U.S. 303, 308 (1879). Windsor requires\n        that classifications based on sexual orientation\n        that impose inequality on gays and lesbians\n        and send a message of second-class status be\n        justified by some legitimate purpose.\n\nSmithKline, 740 F.3d at 482. Windsor makes clear that the\ndefendants’ explicit desire to express a preference for\nopposite-sex couples over same-sex couples is a categorically\ninadequate justification for discrimination. Expressing such\na preference is precisely what they may not do.\n\n    Defendants’ argument is, fundamentally, non-responsive\nto plaintiffs’ claims to marriage rights; instead, it is about the\nsuitability of same-sex couples, married or not, as parents,\nadoptive or otherwise. That it is simply an ill-reasoned excuse\nfor unconstitutional discrimination is evident from the fact\nthat Idaho and Nevada already allow adoption by lesbians and\ngays. The Idaho Supreme Court has determined that “sexual\norientation [is] wholly irrelevant” to a person’s fitness or\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        39\n\nability to adopt children. In re Adoption of Doe, 326 P.3d\n347, 353 (Idaho 2014). “In a state where the privilege of\nbecoming a child’s adoptive parent does not hinge on a\nperson’s sexual orientation, it is impossible to fathom how\nhypothetical concerns about the same person’s parental\nfitness could possibly relate to civil marriage.” Latta, 2014\nWL 1909999, at *23. By enacting a domestic partnership law,\nNevada, too, has already acknowledged that no harm will\ncome of treating same-sex couples the same as opposite-sex\ncouples with regard to parenting. Nev. Rev. Stat.\n§ 122A.200(1)(d) affords same-sex domestic partners\nparenting rights identical to those of married couples,\nincluding those related to adoption, custody and visitation,\nand child support. See also St. Mary v. Damon, 309 P.3d\n1027, 1033 (Nev. 2013) (en banc) (“Both the Legislature and\nthis court have acknowledged that, generally, a child’s best\ninterest is served by maintaining two actively involved\nparents. To that end, the Legislature has recognized that the\nchildren of same-sex domestic partners bear no lesser rights\nto the enjoyment and support of two parents than children\nborn to married heterosexual parents.”).\n\n    To allow same-sex couples to adopt children and then to\nlabel their families as second-class because the adoptive\nparents are of the same sex is cruel as well as\nunconstitutional. Classifying some families, and especially\ntheir children, as of lesser value should be repugnant to all\nthose in this nation who profess to believe in “family values.”\nIn any event, Idaho and Nevada’s asserted preference for\nopposite-sex parents does not, under heightened scrutiny,\ncome close to justifying unequal treatment on the basis of\nsexual orientation.\n\f40                          LATTA V. OTTER\n\n    Thus, we need not address the constitutional restraints the\nSupreme Court has long imposed on sex-role stereotyping,\nwhich may provide another potentially persuasive answer to\ndefendants’ theory. See Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533 (explaining\nthat justifications which “rely on overbroad generalizations\nabout the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males\nand females” are inadequate to survive heightened scrutiny);\nsee also Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 389 (1979)\n(rejecting the claim that “any universal difference between\nmaternal and paternal relations at every phase of a child’s\ndevelopment” justified sex-based distinctions in adoption\nlaws). We note, in addition, that defendants have offered no\nprobative evidence in support of their “complementarity”\nargument.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n     Both the Idaho defendants and the Coalition advance a\nfew additional justifications, though all are unpersuasive.15\nFirst, they argue that the population of each state is entitled to\nexercise its democratic will in regulating marriage as it sees\nfit. Each state “has an undeniable interest in ensuring that its\nrules of domestic relations reflect the widely held values of\nits people.” Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 399 (1978)\n(Powell, J., concurring). True enough. But a primary purpose\nof the Constitution is to protect minorities from oppression by\nmajorities. As Windsor itself made clear, “state laws defining\n\n  15\n     None of the arguments advanced by other states in defense of their\nbans is any more persuasive. In particular, we agree with the Seventh\nCircuit that states may not “go slow” in extending to same-sex couples the\nright to marry; “it is sufficiently implausible that allowing same-sex\nmarriage would cause palpable harm to family, society, or civilization to\nrequire the state to tender evidence justifying [if not proving] its fears; it\nhas provided none.” Baskin, 2014 WL 4359059, at *16–17.\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                               41\n\nand regulating marriage, of course, must respect the\nconstitutional rights of persons.” 133 S. Ct. at 2691 (citing\nLoving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (1967)). Thus, considerations\nof federalism cannot carry the day for defendants. They must\ninstead rely on the substantive arguments that we find lacking\nherein.\n\n    Second, defendants argue that allowing same-sex couples\nto marry would threaten the religious liberty of institutions\nand people in Idaho and Nevada. Whether a Catholic hospital\nmust provide the same health care benefits to its employees’\nsame-sex spouses as it does their opposite-sex spouses, and\nwhether a baker is civilly liable for refusing to make a cake\nfor a same-sex wedding, turn on state public accommodations\nlaw, federal anti-discrimination law, and the protections of\nthe First Amendment.16 These questions are not before us. We\nmerely note that avoiding the enforcement of anti-\ndiscrimination laws that “serv[e] compelling state interests of\nthe highest order” cannot justify perpetuation of an otherwise\n\n\n  16\n     See, e.g., Elane Photography, LLC v. Willock, 284 P.3d 428 (N.M.\n2012) (holding that a wedding photographer was liable for discrimination\nagainst a same-sex couple under state public accommodations law, and\nthat this law did not violate the First Amendment), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct.\n1787 (2014). Nevada law currently prohibits discrimination based on\nsexual orientation in public accommodations, while Idaho law does not.\nNev. Rev. Stat. §§ 651.050(3), 651.070; Dan Popkey, Idaho doesn’t\nprotect gays from discrimination, but Otter says that does not make the\nstate anti-gay, Idaho Statesman (Feb. 23, 2014).\n\n    We note also that an increasing number of religious denominations do\nsanctify same-sex marriages. Amicus Brief of Bishops of the Episcopal\nChurch in Idaho et al. 8–9. Some religious organizations prohibit or\ndiscourage interfaith and interracial marriage, but it would obviously not\nbe constitutional for a state to do so.

Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537,\n549 (1987) (citation omitted).\n\n    Third, the Coalition argues that Nevada’s ban is justified\nby the state’s interest in protecting “the traditional institution\nof marriage.”17 Modern marriage regimes, however, have\nevolved considerably; within the past century, married\nwomen had no right to own property, enter into contracts,\nretain wages, make decisions about children, or pursue rape\nallegations against their husbands. See generally Claudia\nZaher, When A Woman's Marital Status Determined Her\nLegal Status: A Reserach Guide on the Common Law\nDoctrine of Coverture, 94 Law Libr. J. 459, 460–61 (2002)\n(“Under coverture, a wife simply had no legal existence. She\nbecame . . . ‘civilly dead.’”). Women lost their citizenship\nwhen they married foreign men. See Kristin Collins, When\nFather’s Rights Are Mothers’ Duties, 109 Yale L.J. 1669,\n1686–89 (2000). (In fact, women, married or not, were not\nallowed to serve on juries or even to vote. See J.E.B. v.\nAlabama ex rel. T.B., 511 U.S. 127, 131–35 (1994).). Before\nno-fault divorce laws were enacted, separated spouses had to\nfabricate adulterous affairs in order to end their marriages.\nLawrence M. Friedman, A History of American Law 577–78\n(2005). As plaintiffs note, Nevada has been a veritable\npioneer in changing these practices, enacting (and benefitting\neconomically from) laws that made it among the easiest\nplaces in the country to get married and un-married. Both\nIdaho and Nevada’s marriage regimes, as they exist today,\nbear little resemblance to those in place a century ago. As a\nresult, defendants cannot credibly argue that their laws\n\n    17\n       This argument was not advanced to this Court by the Idaho\ndefendants.\n\f                          LATTA V. OTTER                              43\n\nprotect a “traditional institution”; at most, they preserve the\nstatus quo with respect to one aspect of marriage—exclusion\nof same-sex couples.\n\n    Certainly, the exclusion of same-sex couples from\nmarriage is longstanding. However, “it is circular reasoning,\nnot analysis, to maintain that marriage must remain a\nheterosexual institution because that is what it historically has\nbeen.” Goodridge v. Dep't of Pub. Health, 798 N.E. 2d 941,\n961 n.23 (Mass. 2003). The anti-miscegenation laws struck\ndown in Loving were longstanding. Here as there, however,\n“neither history nor tradition [can] save [the laws] from\nconstitutional attack.” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 577–78 (quoting\nBowers v. Hardwick, 478 U.S. 186, 216 (1986) (Stevens, J.,\ndissenting)).\n\n                                   V.\n\n    Idaho and Nevada’s marriage laws, by preventing same-\nsex couples from marrying and refusing to recognize same-\nsex marriages celebrated elsewhere,18 impose profound legal,\nfinancial, social and psychic harms on numerous citizens of\nthose states. These harms are not inflicted on opposite-sex\ncouples, who may, if they wish, enjoy the rights and assume\nthe responsibilities of marriage. Laws that treat people\ndifferently based on sexual orientation are unconstitutional\nunless a “legitimate purpose . . . overcome[s]” the injury\n\n\n 18\n    Because we hold that Idaho and Nevada may not discriminate against\nsame-sex couples in administering their own marriage laws, it follows that\nthey may not discriminate with respect to marriages entered into\nelsewhere. Neither state advances, nor can we imagine, any\ndifferent—much less more persuasive—justification for refusing to\nrecognize same-sex marriages performed in other states or countries.\n\f44                   LATTA V. OTTER\n\ninflicted by the law on lesbians and gays and their families.\nSmithKline, 740 F.3d at 481–82.\n\n    Defendants’ essential contention is that bans on same-sex\nmarriage promote the welfare of children, by encouraging\ngood parenting in stable opposite-sex families. Heightened\nscrutiny, however, demands more than speculation and\nconclusory assertions, especially when the assertions are of\nsuch little merit. Defendants have presented no evidence of\nany such effect. Indeed, they cannot even explain the manner\nin which, as they predict, children of opposite-sex couples\nwill be harmed. Their other contentions are equally without\nmerit. Because defendants have failed to demonstrate that\nthese laws further any legitimate purpose, they unjustifiably\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, and are in\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n    The official message of support that Governor Otter and\nthe Coalition wish to send in favor of opposite-sex marriage\nis equally unconstitutional, in that it necessarily serves to\nconvey a message of disfavor towards same-sex couples and\ntheir families. This is a message that Idaho and Nevada\nsimply may not send.\n\n    The lessons of our constitutional history are clear:\ninclusion strengthens, rather than weakens, our most\nimportant institutions. When we integrated our schools,\neducation improved. See Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka,\n347 U.S. 483, 492–95 (1954). When we opened our juries to\nwomen, our democracy became more vital. See Taylor v.\nLouisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 535–37 (1975). When we allowed\nlesbian and gay soldiers to serve openly in uniform, it\nenhanced unit cohesion. See Witt v. Dep’t of Air Force,\n527 F.3d 806, 821 n.11 (9th Cir. 2008). When same-sex\n\f                       LATTA V.

Redhail, 434 U.S.\n374 (1978), and Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), is\nproperly understood as including the right to marry an\nindividual of one’s choice. That right applies to same-sex\nmarriage just as it does to opposite-sex marriage. As a result,\nI would hold that heightened scrutiny is appropriate for an\nadditional reason: laws abridging fundamental rights are\nsubject to strict scrutiny, and are invalid unless there is a\n“compelling state interest” which they are “narrowly tailored”\n\f46                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nto serve. United States v. Juvenile Male, 670 F.3d 999, 1012\n(9th Cir. 2012) (citing Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302\n(1993)), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 234 (2012). Because the\ninadequacy of the states’ justifications has been thoroughly\naddressed, I write only to explain my view that the same-sex\nmarriage bans invalidated here also implicate plaintiffs’\nsubstantive due process rights.\n\n    Like all fundamental rights claims, this one turns on how\nwe describe the right. Plaintiffs and defendants agree that\nthere is a fundamental right to marry, but defendants insist\nthat this right consists only of the right to marry an individual\nof the opposite sex. In Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S.\n702, 720–21 (1997), the Supreme Court explained “that the\nDue Process Clause specially protects those fundamental\nrights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition.” Our articulation of such\nfundamental rights must, we are told, be “carefully\nformulat[ed].” Id. at 722 (citations and quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n     However, “careful” does not mean “cramped.” Our task\nis to determine the scope of the fundamental right to marry as\ninferred from the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in\nits prior cases. Turner held that prisoners who had no children\nand no conjugal visits during which to conceive\nthem—people who could not be biological parents—had a\ndue process right to marry. 482 U.S. at 94–97. Zablocki held\nthat fathers with outstanding child support obligations—\npeople who were, at least according to adjudications in family\ncourt, unable to adequately provide for existing\nchildren—had a due process right to marry. 434 U.S. at\n383–87.\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                                47\n\n    In each case, the Supreme Court referred to—and\nconsidered the historical roots of—the general right of people\nto marry, rather than a narrower right defined in terms of\nthose who sought the ability to exercise it. These cases\nrejected status-based restrictions on marriage not by\nconsidering whether to recognize a new, narrow fundamental\nright (i.e., the right of prisoners to marry or the right of\nfathers with unpaid child support obligations to marry) or\ndetermining whether the class of people at issue enjoyed the\nright as it had previously been defined, but rather by deciding\nwhether there existed a sufficiently compelling justification\nfor depriving plaintiffs of the right they, as people,\npossessed.1 See id. at 384 (“[D]ecisions of this Court confirm\nthat the right to marry is of fundamental importance for all\nindividuals.”).\n\n    The third and oldest case in the fundamental right to\nmarry trilogy, Loving, is also the most directly on point. That\ncase held that Virginia’s anti-miscegenation laws, which\nprohibited and penalized interracial marriages, violated the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process\nClauses. 388 U.S. at 2–6. In a rhetorical stroke as\nuncomprehending as it is unavailing, defendants contend that\nlesbians and gays are not denied the freedom to marry by\nvirtue of the denial of their right to marry individuals of the\nsame sex, as they are still free to marry individuals of the\n\n 1\n   Turner and Zablocki illustrate another important point, pertinent to the\nadequacy of defendants’ justifications for curtailing the right. The first of\nthese cases involved plaintiffs whom the state was entitled to prevent from\nprocreating, and the second involved those who were unable to support\nexisting offspring financially. If the fundamental right to marry extends to\nthem, it certainly cannot be limited only to those who can procreate or to\nthose who, in the eyes of the state, would form part of an ideal parenting\nunit.\n\f48                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\nopposite sex. Defendants assert that their same-sex marriage\nbans are unlike the laws in Turner and Zablocki because they\ndo not categorically bar people with a particular characteristic\nfrom marrying, but rather limit whom lesbians and gays, and\nall other persons, may marry. However, Loving itself squarely\nrebuts this argument. Mildred Jeter and Richard Loving were\nnot barred from marriage altogether. Jeter was perfectly free\nto marry a black person, and Loving was perfectly free to\nmarry a white person. They were each denied the freedom,\nhowever, to marry the person whom they chose—the other.\nThe case of lesbians and gays is indistinguishable. A\nlimitation on the right to marry another person, whether on\naccount of race or for any other reason, is a limitation on the\nright to marry.2\n\n    Defendants urge that “man-woman” and “genderless”\nmarriage are mutually exclusive, and that permitting the latter\nwill “likely destroy[]” the former. Quite the opposite is true.\nLoving teaches that Virginia’s anti-miscegenation laws did\nnot simply “deprive the Lovings of liberty without due\nprocess of law.” 388 U.S. at 12. They did far worse; as the\nCourt declared, the laws also “surely . . . deprive[d] all the\nState’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” Id.\n(emphasis added). When Virginia told Virginians that they\nwere not free to marry the one they loved if that person was\n\n\n      2\n        Defendants are apparently concerned that if we recognize a\nfundamental right to marry the person of one’s choice, this conclusion will\nnecessarily lead to the invalidation of bans on incest, polygamy, and child\nmarriage. However, fundamental rights may sometimes permissibly be\nabridged: when the laws at issue further compelling state interests, to\nwhich they are narrowly tailored. Although such claims are not before us,\nit is not difficult to envision that states could proffer substantially more\ncompelling justifications for such laws than have been put forward in\nsupport of the same-sex marriage bans at issue here.\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                        49\n\nof a different race, it so grievously constrained their “freedom\nof choice to marry” that it violated the constitutional rights\neven of those citizens who did not themselves wish to enter\ninterracial marriages or who were already married to a person\nof the same race. Id. When Idaho tells Idahoans or Nevada\ntells Nevadans that they are not free to marry the one they\nlove if that person is of the same sex, it interferes with the\nuniversal right of all the State’s citizens—whatever their\nsexual orientation—to “control their destiny.” Lawrence v.\nTexas, 539 U.S. 558, 578 (2003).\n\n    To define the right to marry narrowly, as the right to\nmarry someone of the opposite sex, would be to make the\nsame error committed by the majority in Bowers v. Hardwick,\n478 U.S. 186, 190 (1986), which considered whether there\nwas a “fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy.”\nThis description of the right at issue “fail[ed] to appreciate\nthe extent of the liberty at stake,” the Court stated in\nLawrence, 539 U.S. at 567. Lawrence rejected as\nwrongheaded the question whether “homosexuals” have\ncertain fundamental rights; “persons”—of whatever\norientation—are rights-holders. See id. Fundamental rights\ndefined with respect to the subset of people who hold them\nare fundamental rights misdefined. The question before us is\nnot whether lesbians and gays have a fundamental right to\nmarry a person of the same sex; it is whether a person has a\nfundamental right to marry, to enter into “the most important\nrelation in life,” Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190, 205 (1888),\nwith the one he or she loves. Once the question is properly\ndefined, the answer follows ineluctably: yes.\n\n    Historically, societies have strictly regulated intimacy and\nthereby oppressed those whose personal associations, such as\ncommitted same-sex relationships, were, though harmful to\n\f50                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nno one, disfavored. Human intimacy, like “liberty[,] [has]\nmanifold possibilities.” Lawrence, 539 U.S. at 578. Although\n“times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can\nsee that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve\nonly to oppress[,] [a]s the Constitution endures, persons in\nevery generation can invoke its principles in their own search\nfor greater freedom.” Id. at 578–79.\n\n    We, as judges, deal so often with laws that confine and\nconstrain. Yet our core legal instrument comprehends the\nrights of all people, regardless of sexual orientation, to love\nand to marry the individuals they choose. It demands not\nmerely toleration; when a state is in the business of marriage,\nit must affirm the love and commitment of same-sex couples\nin equal measure. Recognizing that right dignifies them; in so\ndoing, we dignify our Constitution.\n\n\n\nBERZON, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n\n    I agree that Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage\nprohibitions fail because they discriminate on the basis of\nsexual orientation and I join in the Opinion of the Court. I\nwrite separately because I am persuaded that Idaho and\nNevada’s same-sex marriage bans are also unconstitutional\nfor another reason: They are classifications on the basis of\ngender that do not survive the level of scrutiny applicable to\nsuch classifications.\n\f                          LATTA V. OTTER                              51\n\n       I. The Same-Sex Marriage Prohibitions Facially\n          Classify on the Basis of Gender\n\n    “[S]tatutory classifications that distinguish between males\nand females are ‘subject to scrutiny under the Equal\nProtection Clause.’” Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197\n(1976) (quoting Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 75 (1971)). “To\nwithstand constitutional challenge, . . . classifications by\ngender must serve important governmental objectives and\nmust be substantially related to achievement of those\nobjectives.” Id. “The burden of justification” the state\nshoulders under this intermediate level of scrutiny is\n“demanding”: the state must convince the reviewing court\nthat the law’s “proffered justification” for the gender\nclassification “is ‘exceedingly persuasive.’” United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996) (“VMI”). Idaho and\nNevada’s same-sex marriage bans discriminate on the basis\nof sex and so are invalid unless they meet this “demanding”\nstandard.\n\n    A. Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions\nfacially classify on the basis of sex.1 Only women may marry\nmen, and only men may marry women.2 Susan Latta may not\n\n\n   1\n    “Sex” and “gender” are not necessarily coextensive concepts; the\nmeanings of these terms and the difference between them are highly\ncontested. See, e.g., Katherine Franke, The Central Mistake of Sex\nDiscrimination Law: The Disaggregation of Sex from Gender, 144 U. Pa.\nL. Rev 1 (1995). For present purposes, I will use the terms “sex” and\n“gender” interchangeably, to denote the social and legal categorization of\npeople into the generally recognized classes of “men” and “women.”\n  2\n    Idaho Const. art. III § 38 (“A marriage between a man and a woman\nis the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this\nstate.”); Idaho Code § 32-201(1) (“Marriage is a personal relation arising\n\f52                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\nmarry her partner Traci Ehlers for the sole reason that Latta\nis a woman; Latta could marry Ehlers if Latta were a man.\nTheodore Small may not marry his partner Antioco Carillo\nfor the sole reason that Small is a man; Small could marry\nCarillo if Small were a woman. But for their gender,\nplaintiffs would be able to marry the partners of their choice.\nTheir rights under the states’ bans on same-sex marriage are\nwholly determined by their sex.\n\n    A law that facially dictates that a man may do X while a\nwoman may not, or vice versa, constitutes, without more, a\ngender classification. “[T]he absence of a malevolent motive\ndoes not convert a facially discriminatory policy into a\nneutral policy with a discriminatory effect. Whether [a\npolicy] involves disparate treatment through explicit facial\ndiscrimination does not depend on why the [defendant]\ndiscriminates but rather on the explicit terms of the\ndiscrimination.” UAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S.\n187, 199 (1991).3 Thus, plaintiffs challenging policies that\n\n\nout of a civil contract between a man and a woman . . . .”); Nev. Const.\nart.

Stat. § 122.020\n(“[A] male and a female person . . . may be joined in marriage.”).\n  3\n    UAW v. Johnson Controls was a case brought under Title VII of the\nCivil Rights act of 1964, which, inter alia, bans employment policies that\ndiscriminate on the basis of sex. Title VII provides it is\n\n         an unlawful employment practice for an\n         employer—(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge\n         any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any\n         individual with respect to his compensation, terms,\n         conditions, or privileges of employment, because of\n         such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n         origin; (2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                                53\n\nfacially discriminate on the basis of sex need not separately\nshow either “intent” or “purpose” to discriminate. Personnel\nAdm’r of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 277–78\n(1979).\n\n    Some examples help to illuminate these fundamental\nprecepts. Surely, a law providing that women may enter into\nbusiness contracts only with other women would classify on\nthe basis of gender. And that would be so whether or not men\nwere similarly restricted to entering into business\nrelationships only with other men.\n\n\n\n         . . . in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive\n         any individual of employment opportunities or\n         otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\n         because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex,\n         or national origin.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a). The Supreme Court has “analog[ized]” to its\ndecisions interpreting what constitutes discrimination “because of” a\nprotected status under Title VII in analyzing Fourteenth Amendment equal\nprotection claims and vice versa. See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert,\n429 U.S. 125, 133 (1976), superseded by statute on other grounds as\nrecognized in Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. at 219 (“While there is no\nnecessary inference that Congress . . . intended to incorporate into Title\nVII the concepts of discrimination which have evolved from court\ndecisions construing the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment, the similarities between the congressional language and\nsome of those decisions surely indicate that the latter are a useful starting\npoint in interpreting the former.”). As the Court has explained,\n“[p]articularly in the case of defining the term ‘discrimination,’” Title VII\nmust be interpreted consistently with Fourteenth Amendment equal\nprotection principles, because Congress does not define “discrimination”\nin Title VII. See Gilbert, 429 U.S. at 133; see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e. I\ntherefore rely on Title VII cases throughout this Opinion for the limited\npurpose of determining whether a particular classification is or is not sex-\nbased.\n\f54                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\n    Likewise, a prison regulation that requires correctional\nofficers be the same sex as the inmates in a prison “explicitly\ndiscriminates . . . on the basis of . . . sex.” Dothard v.\nRawlinson, 433 U.S. 321, 332, 332 n. 16 (1977). Again, that\nis so whether women alone are affected or whether men are\nsimilarly limited to serving only male prisoners.4\n\n    Further, it can make no difference to the existence of a\nsex-based classification whether the challenged law imposes\ngender homogeneity, as in the business partner example or\nDothard, or gender heterogeneity.          Either way, the\nclassification is one that limits the affected individuals’\nopportunities based on their sex, as compared to the sex of the\nother people involved in the arrangement or transaction.\n\n    As Justice Johnson of the Vermont Supreme Court noted,\nthe same-sex marriage prohibitions, if anything, classify more\nobviously on the basis of sex than they do on the basis of\nsexual orientation: “A woman is denied the right to marry\nanother woman because her would-be partner is a woman, not\nbecause one or both are lesbians. . . . [S]exual orientation\n\n 4\n   Dothard in fact dealt with a regulation that applied equally to men and\nwomen. See 433 U.S. at 332 n. 16 (“By its terms [the regulation at issue]\napplies to contact positions in both male and female institutions.”); see\nalso id. at 325 n. 6. Dothard ultimately upheld the sex-based\ndiscrimination at issue under Title VII’s “bona fide occupational\nqualification” exception, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e), because of the especially\nviolent, sexually charged nature of the particular prisons involved in that\ncase, and because the regulation applied only to correctional officers in\n“contact positions” (i.e. working in close physical proximity to inmates)\nin maximum security institutions. See Dothard, 433 U.S. at 336–37\n(internal quotation marks omitted). For present purposes, the salient\nholding is that the same-sex restriction was overtly a sex-based\nclassification, even if it could be justified by a sufficiently strong BFOQ\nshowing. Id. at 332–33.\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                                55\n\ndoes not appear as a qualification for marriage” under these\nlaws; sex does. Baker v. State, 744 A.2d 864, 905 (Vt. 1999)\n(Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\n   The statutes’ gender focus is also borne out by the\nexperience of one of the Nevada plaintiff couples:\n\n         When Karen Goody and Karen Vibe went to\n         the Washoe County Marriage Bureau to\n         obtain a marriage license, the security officer\n         asked, “Do you have a man with you?” When\n         Karen Vibe said they did not, and explained\n         that she wished to marry Karen Goody, she\n         was told she could not even obtain or\n         complete a marriage license application . . .\n         [because] “[t]wo women can’t apply” . . .\n         [and] marriage is “between a man and a\n         woman.”\n\nNotably, Goody and Vibe were not asked about their sexual\norientation; Vibe was told she was being excluded because of\nher gender and the gender of her partner.\n\n    Of course, the reason Vibe wants to marry Goody, one\npresumes, is due in part to their sexual orientations.5 But that\ndoes not mean the classification at issue is not sex-based.\n\n 5\n   The need for such a presumption, as to a factor that does not appear on\nthe face of the same-sex marriage bans, suggests that the gender\ndiscrimination analysis is, if anything, a closer fit to the problem before\nus than the sexual orientation rubric. While the same-sex marriage\nprohibitions obviously operate to the disadvantage of the people likely to\nwish to marry someone of the same gender—i.e. lesbians, gay men,\nbisexuals, and otherwise-identified persons with same-sex attraction—the\nindividuals’ actual orientation is irrelevant to the application of the laws.\n\f56                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nDothard also involved a facial sex classification intertwined\nwith presumptions about sexual orientation, in that instance\nheterosexuality. The Supreme Court in Dothard agreed that\nthe state was justified in permitting only male officers to\nguard male inmates, because there was “a real risk that other\ninmates, deprived of a normal heterosexual environment,\nwould assault women guards because they were women.”\n433 U.S. at 335. Thus, Dothard’s reasoning confirms the\nobvious: a statute that imposes a sex qualification, whether\nfor a marriage license or a job application, is sex\ndiscrimination, pure and simple, even where assumptions\nabout sexual orientation are also at play.\n\n    Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003) also underscores\nwhy the continuation of the same-sex marriage prohibitions\ntoday is quite obviously about gender. Lawrence held that it\nviolates due process for states to criminalize consensual,\nnoncommercial same-sex sexual activity that occurs in\nprivate between two unrelated adults. See id. at 578. After\nLawrence, then, the continuation of the same-sex marriage\nbans necessarily turns on the gender identity of the spouses,\nnot the sexual activity they may engage in. To attempt to bar\nthat activity would be unconstitutional. See id. The Nevada\nintervenors recognize as much, noting that Lawrence\n“differentiates between the fundamental right of gay men and\nlesbians to enter an intimate relationship, on one hand, and,\non the other hand, the right to marry a member of one’s own\nsex.” The “right to marry a member of one’s own sex”\nexpressly turns on sex.\n\n    B. In concluding that these laws facially classify on the\nbasis of gender, it is of no moment that the prohibitions “treat\nmen as a class and women as a class equally” and in that\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                              57\n\nsense give preference to neither gender, as the defendants6\nfervently maintain. That argument revives the long-\ndiscredited reasoning of Pace v. Alabama, which upheld an\nanti-miscegenation statute on the ground that “[t]he\npunishment of each offending person, whether white or black,\nis the same.” 106 U.S. 583, 585 (1883), overruled by\nMcLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184 (1964). Plessy v.\nFerguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), overruled by Brown v. Board\nof Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), similarly upheld racial\nsegregation on the reasoning that segregation laws applied\nequally to black and white citizens.\n\n    This narrow view of the reach of the impermissible\nclassification concept is, of course, no longer the law after\nBrown. Loving v. Virginia reinforced the post-Brown\nunderstanding of impermissible classification under the\nFourteenth Amendment in a context directly analogous to the\npresent one. Addressing the constitutionality of anti-\nmiscegenation laws banning interracial marriage, Loving\nfirmly “reject[ed] the notion that the mere ‘equal application’\nof a statute containing racial classifications is enough to\nremove the classifications from the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nproscription of all invidious racial discrimination.” 388 U.S.\n1, 8 (1967). As Loving explained, “an even-handed state\npurpose” can still be “repugnant to the Fourteenth\nAmendment,” id. at 11 n. 11, because restricting individuals’\nrights, choices, or opportunities “solely because of racial\nclassifications violates the central meaning of the Equal\nProtection Clause” even if members of all racial groups are\n\n\n 6\n   Following the style of the Opinion of the Court, see Op. Ct. at 22 n. 4,\nI will refer throughout this Opinion to arguments advanced generally by\n“defendants,” meaning the parties that continue actively to argue in\ndefense of the laws, i.e. the Idaho defendants and the Nevada intervenors.\n\f58                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nidentically restricted with regard to interracial marriage. Id.\nat 12. “Judicial inquiry under the Equal Protection Clause . . .\ndoes not end with a showing of equal application among the\nmembers of the class defined by the legislation.”\nMcLaughlin, 379 U.S. 184 at 191.\n\n    If more is needed to confirm that the defendants’ “equal\napplication” theory has no force, there is more—cases\ndecided both before and after Loving. Shelley v. Kraemer, for\nexample, rejected the argument that racially restrictive\ncovenants were constitutional because they would be\nenforced equally against both black and white buyers.\nShelley v. Kraemer 334 U.S. 1, 21–22 (1948). In so holding,\nShelley explained: “The rights created by the first section of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment are, by its terms, guaranteed to\nthe individual. The rights established are personal rights.”\nId. at 22. Shelley also observed that “a city ordinance which\ndenied to colored persons the right to occupy houses in blocks\nin which the greater number of houses were occupied by\nwhite persons, and imposed similar restrictions on white\npersons with respect to blocks in which the greater number of\nhouses were occupied by colored persons” violated the\nFourteenth Amendment despite its equal application to both\nblack and white occupants. See id. at 11 (describing\nBuchanan v. Warley, 245 U.S. 60 (1917)).\n\n    The same individual rights analysis applies in the context\nof gender classifications.        Holding unconstitutional\nperemptory strikes on the basis of gender, J.E.B. explained\nthat “individual jurors themselves have a right to\nnondiscriminatory jury selection procedures . . . . [T]his right\nextends to both men and women.” J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel.\nT.B., 511 U.S. 127, 140–41 (1994). “The neutral phrasing of\nthe Equal Protection Clause, extending its guarantee to ‘any\n\f                        LATTA V.

Manhart\nfurther explains why, even in “the absence of a discriminatory\neffect on women as a class” or on men as a class, the same-\nsex marriage bars constitute gender classifications, because\nthey “discriminate against individual[s] . . . because of their\nsex.” 435 U.S. 702, 716 (1978) (emphasis added). In that\ncase, the parties recognized that women, as a class, lived\nlonger than men. Id. at 707–09. The defendant Department\nargued that this fact justified a policy that facially required all\nwomen to contribute larger monthly sums to their retirement\nplans than men, out of fairness to men as a class, who\notherwise would subsidize women as a class. Id. at 708–09.\nManhart rejected this justification for the sex distinction,\nexplaining that the relevant focus must be “on fairness to\nindividuals rather than fairness to classes,” and held,\naccordingly, that the policy was unquestionably sex\ndiscriminatory. Id. at 709, 711.\n\n    Under all these precedents, it is simply irrelevant that the\nsame-sex marriage prohibitions privilege neither gender as a\nwhole or on average. Laws that strip individuals of their\nrights or restrict personal choices or opportunities solely on\nthe basis of the individuals’ gender are sex discriminatory and\nmust be subjected to intermediate scrutiny. See J.E.B.,\n511 U.S. at 140–42. Accordingly, I would hold that Idaho\nand Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions facially\nclassify on the basis of gender, and that the “equal\n\f60                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\napplication” of these laws to men and women as a class does\nnot remove them from intermediate scrutiny.7\n\n    C. The same-sex marriage prohibitions also constitute\nsex discrimination for the alternative reason that they\nimpermissibly prescribe different treatment for similarly\nsituated subgroups of men and women. That is, the same-sex\nmarriage laws treat the subgroup of men who wish to marry\nmen less favorably than the otherwise similarly situated\nsubgroup of women who want to marry men. And the laws\ntreat the subgroup of women who want to marry women less\n\n\n\n   7\n     Several courts have so held. See Golinski v. U.S. Office of Pers.\nMgmt., 824 F. Supp. 2d 968, 982 n. 4 (N.D. Cal. 2012) (“Ms. Golinski is\nprohibited from marrying Ms. Cunninghis, a woman, because Ms.\nGolinski is a woman. If Ms. Golinski were a man, DOMA would not\nserve to withhold benefits from her. Thus, DOMA operates to restrict Ms.\nGolinski’s access to federal benefits because of her sex.”), initial hearing\nen banc denied, 680 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2012) and appeal dismissed,\n724 F.3d 1048 (9th Cir. 2013) ; In re Levenson, 560 F.3d 1145, 1147 (9th\nCir. EDR 2009) (Reinhardt, J., presiding) (“If [Levenson’s husband] were\nfemale, or if Levenson himself were female, Levenson would be able to\nadd [his husband] as a beneficiary. Thus, the denial of benefits at issue\nhere was sex-based and can be understood as a violation of the . . .\nprohibition of sex discrimination.”); Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 704 F.\nSupp. 2d 921, 996 (N.D. Cal. 2010) (“Perry is prohibited from marrying\nStier, a woman, because Perry is a woman. If Perry were a man,\nProposition 8 would not prohibit the marriage. Thus, Proposition 8\noperates to restrict Perry’s choice of marital partner because of her sex.”),\naff’d sub nom. Perry v. Brown, 671 F.3d 1052 (9th Cir. 2012), vacated\nand remanded sub nom. Hollingsworth v. Perry, 133 S. Ct. 2652 (2013);\nBaehr v. Lewin, 852 P.2d 44, 59 (Haw. 1993) (plurality op.) (a same-sex\nmarriage bar, “on its face, discriminates based on sex”); Baker, 744 A.2d\nat 905 (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a same-sex\nmarriage bar presents “a straightforward case of sex discrimination”\nbecause it “establish[es] a classification based on sex”).\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                       61\n\nfavorably than the subgroup of otherwise identically situated\nmen who want to marry women.\n\n    The Supreme Court has confirmed that such differential\ntreatment of similarly-situated sex-defined subgroups also\nconstitutes impermissible sex discrimination. Phillips v.\nMartin Marietta Corp., for example, held that an employer’s\nrefusal to hire women with preschool-age children, while\nemploying men with children the same age, was facial sex\ndiscrimination, even though all men, and all women without\npreschool-age children, were treated identically. See\n400 U.S. 542, 543–44 (1971) (per curiam). And the Seventh\nCircuit held an airline’s policy requiring female flight\nattendants, but not male flight attendants, to be unmarried\nwas discrimination based on sex, relying on Phillips and\nexplaining that a classification that affects only some\nmembers of one gender is still sex discrimination if similarly\nsituated members of the other gender are not treated the same\nway. “The effect of the statute is not to be diluted because\ndiscrimination adversely affects only a portion of the\nprotected class.” Sprogis v. United Air Lines, Inc., 444 F.2d\n1194, 1198 (7th Cir. 1971).\n\n    Of those individuals who seek to obtain the state-created\nbenefits and obligations of legal marriage to a woman, men\nmay do so but women may not. Thus, at the subclass\nlevel—the level that takes into account the similar situations\nof affected individuals—women as a group and men as a\ngroup are treated differently. For this reason as well I would\nhold that Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions\nfacially classify on the basis of gender. They must be\nreviewed under intermediate scrutiny.\n\f62                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\n    D. One further point bears mention. The defendants note\nthat the Supreme Court summarily rejected an equal\nprotection challenge to a same-sex marriage bar in Baker v.\nNelson, 409 U.S. 810 (1972), holding there was no substantial\nfederal question presented in that case. But the Court did not\nclarify that sex-based classifications receive intermediate\nscrutiny until 1976. See Craig, 429 U.S. at 221, 218\n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (describing the level of review\nprescribed by the majority as “new,” and as “an elevated or\n‘intermediate’ level scrutiny”). As this fundamental doctrinal\nchange postdates Baker, Baker is no longer binding as to the\nsex discrimination analysis, just as it is no longer binding as\nto the sexual orientation discrimination analysis. See Op. Ct.\nat 22–24.\n\n     II. Same-Sex Marriage Bars Are Based in Gender\n         Stereotypes\n\n    Idaho and Nevada’s same sex marriage laws not only\nclassify on the basis of sex but also, implicitly and explicitly,\ndraw on “archaic and stereotypic notions” about the\npurportedly distinctive roles and abilities of men and women.\nEradicating the legal impact of such stereotypes has been a\ncentral concern of constitutional sex-discrimination\njurisprudence for the last several decades. See, e.g.,\nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 725\n(1982). The same-sex marriage bans thus share a key\ncharacteristic with many other sex-based classifications, one\nthat underlay the Court’s adoption of intermediate scrutiny\nfor such classifications.\n\n    The Supreme Court has consistently emphasized that\n“gender-based classifications . . . may be reflective of\n‘archaic and overbroad’ generalizations about gender, or\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        63\n\nbased on ‘outdated misconceptions concerning the role of\nfemales in the home rather than in the marketplace and world\nof ideas.’” J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (quoting Schlesinger v.\nBallard, 419 U.S. 498, 506–07 (1975); Craig, 429 U.S. at\n198–99) (some internal quotation marks omitted). Laws that\nrest on nothing more than “the ‘baggage of sexual\nstereotypes,’ that presume[] the father has the ‘primary\nresponsibility to provide a home and its essentials,’ while the\nmother is the ‘center of home and family life’” have been\ndeclared constitutionally invalid time after time. Califano v.\nWestcott, 443 U.S. 76, 89 (1979) (quoting Orr v. Orr,\n440 U.S. 268, 283 (1979); Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7, 10\n(1975); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522 (1975)).\nMoreover, “gender classifications that rest on impermissible\nstereotypes violate the Equal Protection Clause, even when\nsome statistical support can be conjured up for the\ngeneralization.” J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 139 n. 11. And hostility\ntoward nonconformance with gender stereotypes also\nconstitutes impermissible gender discrimination.           See\ngenerally Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989);\naccord Nichols v. Azteca Rest. Enters., Inc., 256 F.3d 864,\n874 (9th Cir. 2001) (harassment against a person for “failure\nto conform to [sex] stereotypes” is gender-based\ndiscrimination) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    The notion underlying the Supreme Court’s anti-\nstereotyping doctrine in both Fourteenth Amendment and\nTitle VII cases is simple, but compelling: “[n]obody should\nbe forced into a predetermined role on account of sex,” or\npunished for failing to conform to prescriptive expectations\nof what behavior is appropriate for one’s gender. See Ruth\nBader Ginsburg, Gender and the Constitution, 44 U. Cin. L.\nRev. 1, 1 (1975). In other words, laws that give effect to\n“pervasive sex-role stereotype[s]” about the behavior\n\f64                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nappropriate for men and women are damaging because they\nrestrict individual choices by punishing those men and\nwomen who do not fit the stereotyped mold. Nev. Dep’t of\nHuman Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.S. 721, 731, 738 (2003).\n\n    Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions, as\nthe justifications advanced for those prohibitions in this Court\ndemonstrate, patently draw on “archaic and stereotypic\nnotions” about gender. Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725. These\nprohibitions, the defendants have emphatically argued,\ncommunicate the state’s view of what is both “normal” and\npreferable with regard to the romantic preferences,\nrelationship roles, and parenting capacities of men and\nwomen. By doing so, the laws enforce the state’s view that\nmen and women “naturally” behave differently from one\nanother in marriage and as parents.\n\n     The defendants, for example, assert that “gender diversity\nor complementarity among parents . . . provides important\nbenefits” to children, because “mothers and fathers tend on\naverage to parent differently and thus make unique\ncontributions to the child’s overall development.” The\ndefendants similarly assert that “[t]he man-woman meaning\nat the core of the marriage institution, reinforced by the law,\nhas always recognized, valorized, and made normative the\nroles of ‘mother’ and ‘father’ and their uniting,\ncomplementary roles in raising their offspring.”\n\n    Viewed through the prism of the Supreme Court’s\ncontemporary anti-stereotyping sex discrimination doctrine,\nthese proferred justifications simply underscore that the\nsame-sex marriage prohibitions discriminate on the basis of\nsex, not only in their form—which, as I have said, is\nsufficient in itself—but also in reviving the very infirmities\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                         65\n\nthat led the Supreme Court to adopt an intermediate scrutiny\nstandard for sex classifications in the first place. I so\nconclude for two, somewhat independent, reasons.\n\n    A. First, and more obviously, the gender stereotyping at\nthe core of the same-sex marriage prohibitions clarifies that\nthose laws affect men and women in basically the same way\nas, not in a fundamentally different manner from, a wide\nrange of laws and policies that have been viewed consistently\nas discrimination based on sex. As has been repeated again\nand again, legislating on the basis of such stereotypes limits,\nand is meant to limit, the choices men and women make\nabout the trajectory of their own lives, choices about work,\nparenting, dress, driving—and yes, marriage. This focus in\nmodern sex discrimination law on the preservation of the\nability freely to make individual life choices regardless of\none’s sex confirms that sex discrimination operates at, and\nmust be justified at, the level of individuals, not at the broad\nclass level of all men and women. Because the same-sex\nmarriage prohibitions restrict individuals’ choices on the\nbasis of sex, they discriminate based on sex for purposes of\nconstitutional analysis precisely to the same degree as other\nstatutes that infringe on such choices—whether by\ndistributing benefits or by restricting behavior—on that same\nground.\n\n    B. Second, the long line of cases since 1971 invalidating\nvarious laws and policies that categorized by sex have been\npart of a transformation that has altered the very institution at\nthe heart of this case, marriage.             Reviewing that\ntransformation, including the role played by constitutional\nsex discrimination challenges in bringing it about, reveals that\nthe same sex marriage prohibitions seek to preserve an\noutmoded, sex-role-based vision of the marriage institution,\n\f66                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nand in that sense as well raise the very concerns that gave rise\nto the contemporary constitutional approach to sex\ndiscrimination.\n\n    (i) Historically, marriage was a profoundly unequal\ninstitution, one that imposed distinctly different rights and\nobligations on men and women. The law of coverture, for\nexample, deemed the “the husband and wife . . . one person,”\nsuch that “the very being or legal existence of the woman\n[was] suspended . . . or at least [was] incorporated and\nconsolidated into that of the husband” during the marriage.\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n441 (3d rev. ed. 1884). Under the principles of coverture, “a\nmarried woman [was] incapable, without her husband’s\nconsent, of making contracts . . . binding on her or him.”\nBradwell v. Illinois, 83 U.S. 130, 141 (1872) (Bradley, J.,\nconcurring). She could not sue or be sued without her\nhusband’s consent. See, e.g., Nancy F. Cott, Public Vows: A\nHistory of Marriage and the Nation 11–12 (2000). Married\nwomen also could not serve as the legal guardians of their\nchildren. Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973)\n(plurality op.).\n\n    Marriage laws further dictated economically disparate\nroles for husband and wife. In many respects, the marital\ncontract was primarily understood as an economic\narrangement between spouses, whether or not the couple had\nor would have children. “Coverture expressed the legal\nessence of marriage as reciprocal: a husband was bound to\nsupport his wife, and in exchange she gave over her property\nand labor.” Cott, Public Vows, at 54. That is why “married\nwomen traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or\nconvey property . . . .” Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685. Notably,\nhusbands owed their wives support even if there were no\n\f                        LATTA V. OTTER                          67\n\nchildren of the marriage. See, e.g., Hendrik Hartog, Man and\nWife in America: A History 156 (2000).\n\n    There was also a significant disparity between the rights\nof husbands and wives with regard to physical intimacy. At\ncommon law, “a woman was the sexual property of her\nhusband; that is, she had a duty to have intercourse with\nhim.” John D’Emilio & Estelle B. Freedman, Intimate\nMatters: A History of Sexuality in America 79 (3d ed. 2012).\nQuite literally, a wife was legally “the possession of her\nhusband, . . . [her] husband’s property.” Hartog, Man and\nWife in America, at 137. Accordingly, a husband could sue\nhis wife’s lover in tort for “entic[ing]” her or “alienat[ing]”\nher affections and thereby interfering with his property rights\nin her body and her labor. Id. A husband’s possessory\ninterest in his wife was undoubtedly also driven by the fact\nthat, historically, marriage was the only legal site for licit sex;\nsex outside of marriage was almost universally criminalized.\nSee, e.g., Ariela R. Dubler, Immoral Purposes: Marriage and\nthe Genus of Illicit Sex, 115 Yale L.J. 756, 763–64 (2006).\n\n    Notably, although sex was strongly presumed to be an\nessential part of marriage, the ability to procreate was\ngenerally not. See, e.g., Chester Vernier, American Family\nLaws: A Comparative Study of the Family Law of the Forty-\nEight American States, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and\nHawaii (to Jan. 1, 1931) (1931) I § 50, 239–46 (at time of\nsurvey, grounds for annulment typically included impotency,\nas well as incapacity due to minority or “non-age”; lack of\nunderstanding and insanity; force or duress; fraud; disease;\nand incest; but not inability to conceive); II § 68, at 38–39\n(1932) (at time of survey, grounds for divorce included\n“impotence”; vast majority of states “generally held that\nimpotence . . . does not mean sterility but must be of such a\n\f68                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nnature as to render complete sexual intercourse practically\nimpossible”; and only Pennsylvania “ma[d]e sterility a cause”\nfor divorce).\n\n    The common law also dictated that it was legally\nimpossible for a man to rape his wife. Men could not be\nprosecuted for spousal rape. A husband’s “incapacity” to\nrape his wife was justified by the theory that “‘the marriage\nconstitute[d] a blanket consent to sexual intimacy which the\nwoman [could] revoke only by dissolving the marital\nrelationship.’” See, e.g., Jill Elaine Hasday, Contest and\nConsent: A Legal History of Marital Rape, 88 Calif. L. Rev\n1373, 1376 n. 9 (2000) (quoting Model Penal Code and\nCommentaries, § 213.1 cmt. 8(c), at 342 (Official Draft and\nRevised Comments 1980)).\n\n    Concomitantly, dissolving the marital partnership via\ndivorce was exceedingly difficult. Through the mid-twentieth\ncentury, divorce could be obtained only on a limited set of\ngrounds, if at all. At the beginning of our nation’s history,\nseveral states did not permit full divorce except under the\nnarrowest of circumstances; separation alone was the remedy,\neven if a woman could show “cruelty endangering life or\nlimb.” Peter W. Bardaglio, Reconstrucing the Household:\nFamilies, Sex, and the Law in the Nineteenth-Century South\n33 (1995); see also id. 32–33. In part, this policy dovetailed\nwith the grim fact that, at English common law, and in\nseveral states through the beginning of the nineteenth century,\n“a husband’s prerogative to chastise his wife”—that is, to\nbeat her short of permanent injury—was recognized as his\nmarital right. Reva B. Siegel, “The Rule of Love”: Wife\nBeating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L.J. 2117,\n2125 (1996).\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        69\n\n     Perhaps unsurprisingly, the profoundly unequal status of\nmen and women in marriage was frequently cited as\njustification for denying women equal rights in other arenas,\nincluding the workplace. “[S]tate courts made clear that the\nbasis, and validity, of such laws lay in stereotypical beliefs\nabout the appropriate roles of men and women.” Hibbs v.\nDep’t of Human Res., 273 F.3d 844, 864 (9th Cir. 2001), aff’d\nsub nom. Nevada Dep’t of Human Res. v. Hibbs, 538 U.S.\n721. Justice Bradley infamously opined in 1887 that “the\ncivil law, as well as nature herself, has always recognized a\nwide difference in the respective spheres and destinies of man\nand woman.” Bradwell, 83 U.S. at 141 (Bradley, J.,\nconcurring). On this view, women could be excluded from\nvarious professions because “[t]he natural and proper timidity\nand delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits\nit for many of the occupations of civil life.” Id. Instead, the\nlaw gave effect to the belief that “[t]he paramount destiny and\nmission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices\nof wife and mother.” Id.\n\n    As a result of this separate-spheres regime,\n“‘[h]istorically, denial or curtailment of women’s\nemployment opportunities has been traceable directly to the\npervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and\nworkers second.’ . . . Stereotypes about women’s domestic\nroles [we]re reinforced by parallel stereotypes presuming a\nlack of domestic responsibilities for men.” Hibbs, 538 U.S.\nat 736 (quoting the Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on\nLabor–Management Relations and the Subcommittee on\nLabor Standards of the House Committee on Education and\nLabor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 100 (1986)). Likewise, social\nbenefits programs historically distinguished between men and\nwomen on the assumption, grounded in the unequal marital\nstatus of men and women, that women were more likely to be\n\f70                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nhomemakers, supported by their working husbands. See, e.g.,\nCalifano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.S. 199, 205–07 (1977);\nWeinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 644–45 (1975).\n\n    (ii) This asymmetrical regime began to unravel slowly in\nthe nineteenth century, starting with the advent of Married\nWomen’s Property Acts, which allowed women to possess\nproperty in their own right for the first time. See, e.g., Reva\nB. Siegel, The Modernization of Marital Status Law:\nAdjudicating Wives’ Rights to Earnings, 1860–1930, 82 Geo.\nL. Rev. 2127(1994). Eventually, state legislatures revised\ntheir laws. Today, of course, a married woman may enter\ncontracts, sue and be sued without her husband’s\nparticipation, and own and convey property. The advent of\n“no fault” divorce regimes in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nmade marital dissolutions more common, and legislatures\nalso directed family courts to impose child and spousal\nsupport obligations on divorcing couples without regard to\ngender. See Cott, Public Vows, at 205–06. As these\nlegislative reforms were taking hold, “in 1971 . . . the Court\nf[ou]nd for the first time that a state law violated the Equal\nProtection Clause because it arbitrarily discriminated on the\nbasis of sex.” Hibbs, 273 F.3d at 865 (citing Reed, 404 U.S.\n71).\n\n    This same legal transformation extended into the marital\n(and nonmarital) bedroom.          Spousal rape has been\ncriminalized in all states since 1993. See, e.g., Sarah M.\nHarless, From the Bedroom to the Courtroom: The Impact of\nDomestic Violence Law on Marital Rape Victims, 35 Rutgers\nL.J. 305, 318 (2003). Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479\n(1965), held that married couples have a fundamental privacy\nright to use contraceptives, and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S.\n438 (1972), later applied equal protection principles to extend\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                         71\n\nthis right to single persons. More recently, Lawrence\nclarified that licit, consensual sexual behavior is no longer\nconfined to marriage, but is protected when it occurs, in\nprivate, between two consenting adults, regardless of their\ngender. See 539 U.S. at 578.\n\n    In the child custody context, mothers and fathers today\nare generally presumed to be equally fit parents. See, e.g.,\nCott, Public Vows, at 206. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645,\n658 (1972), for example, held invalid as an equal protection\nviolation a state law that presumed unmarried fathers, but not\nunwed mothers, unfit as parents. Later, the Supreme Court\nexpressly “reject[ed] . . . the claim that . . . [there is] any\nuniversal difference between maternal and paternal relations\nat every phase of a child’s development.” Caban v.\nMohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 389 (1979). Likewise, both\nspouses in a marriage are now entitled to economic support\nwithout regard to gender. See Cott, at 206–07. Once again,\nequal protection adjudication contributed to this change: Orr,\n440 U.S. at 278–79, struck down a state statutory scheme\nimposing alimony obligations on husbands but not wives.\n\n    In short, a combination of constitutional sex-\ndiscrimination adjudication, legislative changes, and social\nand cultural transformation has, in a sense, already rendered\ncontemporary marriage “genderless,” to use the phrase\nfavored by the defendants. See Op. Ct. at 25 n. 6. For, as a\nresult of these transformative social, legislative, and doctrinal\ndevelopments, “[g]ender no longer forms an essential part of\nmarriage; marriage under law is a union of equals.” Perry,\n704 F. Supp. 2d at 993. As a result, in the states that\ncurrently ban same-sex marriage, the legal norms that\ncurrently govern the institution of marriage are “genderless”\nin every resepect except the requirement that would-be\n\f72                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nspouses be of different genders. With that exception, Idaho\nand Nevada’s marriage regimes have jettisoned the rigid roles\nmarriage as an institution once prescribed for men and\nwomen. In sum, “the sex-based classification contained in\nthe[se] marriage laws,” as the only gender classification that\npersists in some states’ marriage statutes, is, at best, “a\nvestige of sex-role stereotyping” that long plagued marital\nregimes before the modern era, see Baker, 744 A.2d at 906\n(Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and,\nat worst, an attempt to reintroduce gender roles.\n\n    The same-sex marriage bars constitute gender\ndiscrimination both facially and when recognized, in their\nhistorical context, both as resting on sex stereotyping and as\na vestige of the sex-based legal rules once imbedded in the\ninstitution of marriage. They must be subject to intermediate\nscrutiny.\n\n     III.   Idaho and Nevada’s Same-Sex Marriage\n            Prohibitions Fail Under Intermediate Scrutiny\n\n    For Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions\nto survive the intermediate scrutiny applicable to sex\ndiscriminatory laws, it must be shown that these laws “serve\nimportant governmental objectives and [are] substantially\nrelated to achievement of those objectives.” Craig, 429 U.S.\nat 197. “The purpose of requiring that close relationship is to\nassure that the validity of a classification is determined\nthrough reasoned analysis rather than through the mechanical\napplication of traditional, often inaccurate, assumptions about\nthe proper roles of men and women.” Hogan, 458 U.S. at\n725–26.\n\f                            LATTA V. OTTER                                73\n\n    In part, the interests advanced by the defendants fail\nbecause they are interests in promoting and enforcing gender\nstereotyping and so simply are not legitimate governmental\ninterests. And even if we assume that the other governmental\nobjectives cited by the defendants are legitimate and\nimportant, the defendants have not shown that the same-sex\nmarriage prohibitions are substantially related to achieving\nany of them.\n\n    The asserted interests fall into roughly three categories:\n(1) ensuring children are raised by parents who provide them\nwith the purported benefits of “gender complementarity,” also\nreferred to as “gender diversity”; (2) “furthering the stability\nof family structures through benefits targeted at couples\npossessing biological procreative capacity,” and/or\ndiscouraging “motherlessness” or “fatherlessness in the\nhome”; and (3) promoting a “child-centric” rather than\n“adult-centric” model of marriage.”8 The defendants insist\nthat “genderless marriage run[s] counter to . . . [these] norms\nand ideals,” which is why “man-woman marriage” must be\npreserved.\n\n\n\n\n    8\n        The defendants also assert that the state has an interest in\n“accommodating religious freedom and reducing the potential for civic\nstrife.” But, as the Opinion of the Court notes, even if allowing same-sex\nmarriage were likely to lead to religious strife, which is highly doubtful,\nto say the least, that fact would not justify the denial of equal protection\ninherent in the gender-based classification of the same-sex marriage bars.\nSee Watson v. City of Memphis, 373 U.S. 526, 535 (1963) (rejecting the\ncity’s proffered justification that delay in desegregating park facilities was\nnecessary to avoid interracial “turmoil,” and explaining “constitutional\nrights may not be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or\nexercise”).\n\f74                      LATTA V. OTTER\n\n    The Opinion of the Court thoroughly demonstrates why\nall of these interests are without merit as justifications for\nsexual orientation discrimination. I add this brief analysis\nonly to show that the justifications are likewise wholly\ninsufficient under intermediate scrutiny to support the sex-\nbased classifications at the core of these laws.\n\n    A. The Idaho defendants assert that the state has an\ninterest in ensuring children have the benefit of parental\n“gender complementarity.” There must be “space in the law\nfor the distinct role of ‘mother’ [and] the distinct role of\n‘father’ and therefore of their united, complementary role in\nraising offspring,” the Idaho defendants insist. On a slightly\ndifferent tack, the Nevada intervenors similarly opine that\n“[s]ociety has long recognized that diversity in education\nbrings a host of benefits to students,” and ask, “[i]f that is true\nin education, why not in parenting?”\n\n    Under the constitutional sex-discrimination jurisprudence\nof the last forty years, neither of these purported justifications\ncan possibly pass muster as a justification for sex\ndiscrimination. Indeed, these justifications are laden with the\nvery “‘baggage of sexual stereotypes’” the Supreme Court\nhas repeatedly disavowed. Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. at\n89 (quoting Orr, 440 U.S. at 283).\n\n    (i) It should be obvious that the stereotypic notion “that\nthe two sexes bring different talents to the parenting\nenterprise,” runs directly afoul of the Supreme Court’s\nrepeated disapproval of “generalizations about ‘the way\nwomen are,’” VMI, 518 U.S. at 550, or “the way men are,” as\na basis for legislation. Just as Orr, 440 U.S. at 279–80,\nrejected gender-disparate alimony statutes “as effectively\nannouncing the State’s preference for an allocation of family\n\f                          LATTA V. OTTER                              75\n\nresponsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role,”\nso a state preference for supposed gender-specific parenting\nstyles cannot serve as a legitimate reason for a sex-based\nclassification.\n\n    This conclusion would follow “[e]ven [if] some statistical\nsupport can be conjured up for the generalization” that men\nand women behave differently as marital partners and/or\nparents, because laws that rely on gendered stereotypes about\nhow men and women behave (or should behave) must be\nreviewed under intermediate scrutiny. See J.E.B., 511 U.S.\nat 140. It has even greater force where, as here, the supposed\ndifference in parenting styles lacks reliable empirical support,\neven “on average.”9 Communicating such archaic gender-\nrole stereotypes to children, or to parents and potential\nparents, is not a legitimate governmental interest, much less\na substantial one.\n\n    (ii) The assertion that preserving “man-woman marriage”\nis permissible because the state has a substantial interest in\npromoting “diversity” has no more merit than the “gender\ncomplementarity” justification. Diversity is assuredly a\nweighty interest in the context of public educational\ninstitutions, with hundreds or thousands of individuals. But\n“[t]he goal of community diversity has no place . . . as a\nrequirement of marriage,” which, by law, is a private\ninstitution consisting only of two persons. Baker v. State,\n744 A.2d at 910 (Johnson, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). “To begin with, carried to its logical\n\n\n  9\n    As one of the plaintiffs’ expert psychologists, Dr. Michael Lamb,\nexplained, “[t]here . . . is no empirical support for the notion that the\npresence of both male and female role models in the home enhances the\nadjustment of children and adolescents.”\n\f76                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nconclusion, the [Nevada intervenors’] rationale could require\nall marriages to be between [two partners], not just of the\nopposite sex, but of different races, religions, national origins,\nand so forth, to promote diversity.” Id. Such an absurd\nrequirement would obviously be unconstitutional. See\nLoving, 388 U.S. 1.\n\n     Moreover, even if it were true that, on average, women\nand men have different perspectives on some issues because\nof different life experiences, individual couples are at least as\nlikely to exhibit conformity as diversity of personal\ncharacteristics. Sociological research suggests that individual\nmarried couples are more likely to be similar to each other in\nterms of political ideology, educational background, and\neconomic background than they are to be dissimilar; despite\nthe common saying that “opposites attract,” in actuality it\nappears that “like attracts like.” See, e.g., John R. Alford et\nal., The Politics of Mate Choice, 73:2 J. Politics 362, 376\n(2011) (“[S]pousal concordance in the realm of social and\npolitical attitudes is extremely high.”); Jeremy Greenwood et\nal., Marry Your Like: Assortative Mating and Income\nInequality (Population Studies Ctr., Univ. Of Penn., Working\nPaper No. 14-1, at 1, 2014) (Since the 1960s, “the degree of\nassortative mating [with regard to educational level] has\nincreased.”). Further, there is no evidence of which I am\naware that gender is a better predictor of diversity of\nviewpoints or of parenting styles than other characteristics.\nSuch “gross generalizations that would be deemed\nimpermissible if made on the basis of race [do not become]\nsomehow permissible when made on the basis of gender.”\nJ.E.B., 511 U.S. at 139–40.\n\n   In short, the defendants’ asserted state interests in “gender\ncomplementarity” and “gender diversity” are not legitimate\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                        77\n\n“important governmental objectives.” See Craig, 429 U.S. at\n197. Accordingly, I do not address whether excluding same-\nsex couples from marriage is substantially related to this goal.\n\n    B. The defendants also argue that their states have an\nimportant interest in “encouraging marriage between\nopposite-sex partners” who have biological children, so that\nthose children are raised in an intact marriage rather than in\na cohabiting or single-parent household. Assuming that this\npurpose is in fact a “important governmental objective,” the\ndefendants have entirely failed to explain how excluding\nsame-sex couples from marriage is substantially related to\nachieving the objective of furthering family stability.\n\n     (i) I will interpret the asserted state goal in preventing\n“fatherlessness” and “motherlessness” broadly. That is, I\nshall assume that the states want to discourage parents from\nabandoning their children by encouraging dual parenting over\nsingle parenting. If the asserted purpose were instead read\nnarrowly, as an interest in ensuring that a child has both a\nmother and a father in the home (rather than two mothers or\ntwo fathers), the justification would amount to the same\njustification as the asserted interest in “gender\ncomplementarity,” and would fail for the same reason. That\nis, the narrower version of the family stability justification\nrests on impermissible gender stereotypes about the relative\ncapacities of men and women.\n\n    Discouraging single parenting by excluding same-sex\ncouples from marriage is oxymoronic, in the sense that it will\nlikely achieve exactly the opposite of what the states say they\nseek to accomplish. The defendants’ own evidence suggests\nthat excluding same-sex couples from marriage renders their\n\f78                       LATTA V. OTTER\n\nunions less stable, increasing the risk that the children of\nthose couples will be raised by one parent rather than two.\n\n    True, an increasing number of children are now born and\nraised outside of marriage, a development that may well be\nundesirable.10 But that trend began apace well before the\nadvent of same-sex marriage and has been driven by entirely\ndifferent social and legal developments. The trend can be\ntraced to declines in marriage rates, as well as to the rise in\ndivorce rates after the enactment of “no fault” divorce\nregimes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. “The proportion\nof adults who declined to marry at all rose substantially\nbetween 1972 and 1998 . . . . [In the same period,] [t]he\ndivorce rate rose more furiously, to equal more than half the\nmarriage rate, portending that at least one in two marriages\nwould end in divorce.” Cott, Public Vows, at 203. The\ndefendants’ assertion that excluding same-sex couples from\nmarriage will do anything to reverse these trends is utterly\nunsubstantiated.\n\n    (ii) The defendants’ appeal to biology is similarly\nwithout merit. Their core assertion is that the states have a\nsubstantial interest in channeling opposite-sex couples into\nmarriage, so that any accidentally produced children are more\nlikely to be raised in a two-parent household. But the\nexclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and\nobligations of state-sanctioned marriage is assuredly not\n\n     10\n       According to the defendants, “[b]etween 1970 and 2005, the\nproportion of children living with two married parents dropped from 85\npercent to 68 percent,” and as of 2008, “[m]ore than a third of all U.S.\nchildren [were] . . . born outside of wedlock.” See Benjamin Scafidi,\nInstitute for American Values, The Taxpayer Costs of Divorce and Unwed\nChildbearing: First-Ever Estimates for the Nation and All Fifty States 7\n(2008).\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                        79\n\n“substantially related,” Craig, 429 U.S. at 197, to achieving\nthat goal.\n\n    The reason only opposite-sex couples should be allowed\nto marry, we are told by the defendants, is that they “possess\nthe unique ability to create new life.” But both same-sex and\nopposite-sex couples can and do produce children\nbiologically related only to one member of the couple, via\nassisted reproductive technology or otherwise. And both\nsame-sex and opposite-sex couples adopt children, belying\nthe notion that the two groups necessarily differ as to their\nbiological connection to the children they rear.\n\n    More importantly, the defendants “cannot explain how the\nfailure of opposite-sex couples to accept responsibility for the\nchildren they create relates at all to the exclusion of same-sex\ncouples from the benefits of marriage.” Baker, 744 A.2d at\n911 (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nFor one thing, marriage has never been restricted to opposite-\nsex couples able to procreate; as noted earlier, the spousal\nrelationship, economic and otherwise, has always been\nunderstood as a sufficient basis for state approval and\nregulation. See supra pp. 65–68. For another, to justify sex\ndiscrimination, the state must explain why the discriminatory\nfeature is closely related to the state interest. See Hogan,\n458 U.S. at 725–26. The states thus would have to explain,\nwithout reliance on sex-stereotypical notions, why the bans\non same-sex marriage advance their interests in inducing\nmore biological parents to marry each other. No such\nshowing has been or can be made.\n\n   Biological parents’ inducements to marry will remain\nexactly what they have always been if same-sex couples can\nmarry. The legal benefits of marriage—taxation, spousal\n\f80                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nsupport, inheritance rights, familial rights to make decisions\nconcerning the illness and death of a spouse, and so on—will\nnot change. See, e.g., Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 95–96\n(1987). The only change will be that now-excluded couples\nwill enjoy the same rights. As the sex-based exclusion of\nsame-sex couples from marrying does not in any way\nenhance the marriage benefits available to opposite-sex\ncouples, that exclusion does not substantially advance—or\nadvance at all—the state interest in inducing opposite-sex\ncouples to raise their biological children within a stable\nmarriage.\n\n    (iii) Finally, the defendants argue that “the traditional\nmarriage institution” or “man-woman marriage . . . is\nrelatively but decidedly more child-centric” than “genderless\nmarriage,” which they insist is “relatively but decidedly more\nadult-centric.”\n\n    These assertions are belied by history. As I have noted,\nsee supra pp. 65–71, “traditional marriage” was in fact quite\n“adult-centric.” Marriage was, above all, an economic\narrangement between spouses. See, e.g., Cott, Public Vows,\nat 54. Whether or not there were children, the law imposed\nsupport obligations, inheritance rules, and other rights and\nburdens upon married men and women. Moreover, couples\nunwilling or unable to procreate have never been prevented\nfrom marrying. Nor was infertility generally recognized as a\nground for divorce or annulment under the old fault-based\nregime, even though sexual impotence was. See, e.g.,\nVernier, I §50, II § 68.\n\n   Further, the social concept of “companionate\nmarriage”—that is, legal marriage for companionship\npurposes without the possibility of children—has existed\n\f                         LATTA V. OTTER                             81\n\nsince at least the 1920s. See Christina Simmons, Making\nMarriage Modern: Women’s Sexuality from the Progressive\nEra to World War II 121 (2009). The Supreme Court called\non this concept when it recognized the right of married\ncouples to use contraception in 1965. Griswold, 381 U.S. at\n486. Griswold reasoned that, with or without procreation,\nmarriage was “an association for as noble a purpose as any.”\nId.\n\n   Same-sex marriage is thus not inherently less “child-\ncentric” than “traditional marriage.”11 In both versions, the\ncouple may bear or adopt and raise children, or not.\n\n    Finally, a related notion the defendants advance, that\nallowing same-sex marriage will render the marriage\ninstitution “genderless,” in the sense that gender roles within\nopposite-sex marriages will be altered, is also ahistorical. As\nI have explained, those roles have already been profoundly\naltered by social, legislative, and adjudicative changes. All\nthese changes were adopted toward the end of eliminating\nthe gender-role impositions that previously inhered in the\nlegal regulation of marriage.\n\n    In short, the “child-centric”/“adult-centric” distinction is\nan entirely ephemeral one, at odds with the current realities\nof marriage as an institution. There is simply no substantial\n\n\n\n 11\n     Moreover, if the assertion that same-sex marriages are more “adult-\ncentric” is meant to imply state disapproval of the sexual activity\npresumed to occur in same-sex marriages, that disapproval could not be\na legitimate state purpose. After Lawrence, the right to engage in same-\nsex sexual activity is recognized as a protected liberty interest. See\n539 U.S. at 578.\n\f82                       LATTA V. OTTER\n\nrelationship between discouraging an “adult-centric” model\nof marriage and excluding same-sex couples.\n\n     IV. Conclusion\n\n    “Intentional discrimination on the basis of gender by state\nactors violates the Equal Protection Clause, particularly\nwhere, as here, the discrimination serves to ratify and\nperpetuate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes\nabout the relative abilities of men and women.” J.E.B.,\n511 U.S. at 130–31. Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage\nproscriptions are sex based, and these bans do serve to\npreserve “invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes”\nconcerning gender roles. The bans therefore must fail as\nimpermissible gender discrimination.\n\n    I do not mean, by presenting this alternative analysis, to\nminimize the fact that the same-sex marriage bans necessarily\nhave their greatest effect on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and\ntransgender individuals. Still, it bears noting that the social\nexclusion and state discrimination against lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, and transgender people reflects, in large part,\ndisapproval of their nonconformity with gender-based\nexpectations.12    That is, such individuals are often\ndiscriminated against because they are not acting or speaking\nor dressing as “real men” or “real women” supposedly do.\n“[S]tereotypes about homosexuality are directly related to our\nstereotypes about the proper roles of men and women.”\n\n\n     12\n       Although not evidently represented among the plaintiff class,\ntransgender people suffer from similar gender stereotyping expectations.\nSee, e.g., Schwenk v. Hartford, 204 F.3d 1187, 1201–02 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(discrimination on the basis of transgender status is also gender\ndiscrimination).\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        83\n\nCentola v. Porter, 183 F. Supp. 2d 403, 410 (D. Mass. 2002);\nsee also Andrew Koppelman, Why Discrimination Against\nLesbians and Gay Men is Sex Discrimination, 69 N.Y.U. L.\nRev. 197 (1994). The same-sex marriage prohibitions, in\nother words, impose harms on sexual orientation and gender\nidentity minorities precisely because they impose and enforce\ngender-normative behavior.\n\n    I do recognize, however, that the gender classification\nrubric does not adequately capture the essence of many of the\nrestrictions targeted at lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.\nEmployment discrimination, housing discrimination, and\nperemptory strikes on the basis of sexual orientation, to name\na few of the exclusions gays, lesbians, and other sexual\norientation minorities have faced, are primarily motivated by\nstereotypes about sexual orientation; by animus against\npeople based on their nonconforming sexual orientation; and\nby distaste for same-sex sexual activity or the perceived\npersonal characteristics of individuals who engage in such\nbehavior. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996);\nSmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Labs., 740 F.3d 471\n(2014). And those sorts of restrictions do not turn directly on\ngender; they do not withhold a benefit, choice, or opportunity\nfrom an individual because that individual is a man or a\nwoman. Although the gender stereotyping so typical of sex\ndiscrimination may be present, see generally Koppelman, 69\nN.Y.U. L. Rev. 197, those restrictions are better analyzed as\nsexual orientation discrimination, as we did in SmithKline.\n740 F.3d at 480–84.\n\n    As to the same-sex marriage bans in particular, however,\nthe gender discrimination rubric does squarely apply, for the\nreasons I have discussed. And as I hope I have shown, the\nconcepts and standards developed in more than forty years of\n\f84                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nconstitutional sex discrimination jurisprudence rest on the\nunderstanding that “[s]anctioning sex-based classifications on\nthe grounds that men and women, simply by virtue of their\ngender, necessarily play different roles in the lives of their\nchildren and in their relationships with each other causes\nconcrete harm to women and to men throughout our society.”\nDeborah A. Widiss et al., Exposing Sex Stereotypes in Recent\nSame-Sex Marriage Jurisprudence, 30 Harv. J. L. & Gender\n461, 505 (2007). In my view, the same-sex marriage bans\nbelie that understanding, and, for that reason as well, cannot\nstand.\n\f",

They argue that the\nlaws are subject to heightened scrutiny because they deprive\nplaintiffs of the fundamental due process right to marriage,\nand because they deny them equal protection of the law by\ndiscriminating against them on the bases of their sexual\norientation and their sex. In response, Governor Otter,\nRecorder Rich, and the State of Idaho, along with the Nevada\nintervenors, the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage (“the\nCoalition”), argue that their laws survive heightened scrutiny,\nprimarily because the states have a compelling interest in\nsending a message of support for the institution of opposite-\nsex marriage. They argue that permitting same-sex marriage\nwill seriously undermine this message, and contend that the\ninstitution of opposite-sex marriage is important because it\nencourages people who procreate to be responsible parents,\nand because opposite-sex parents are better for children than\nsame-sex parents.\n\n    Without the benefit of our decision in SmithKline\nBeecham Corp. v.

OTTER                                25\n\nmarried couples by state and federal law6—merely because of\ntheir sexual orientation.\n\n    Defendants argue that their same-sex marriage bans do\nnot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, but rather\non the basis of procreative capacity. Effectively if not\nexplicitly, they assert that while these laws may disadvantage\nsame-sex couples and their children, heightened scrutiny is\nnot appropriate because differential treatment by sexual\norientation is an incidental effect of, but not the reason for,\n\n\n  6\n     Nevada, unlike Idaho, has enacted a domestic partnership regime.\nSince 2009, both same-sex and opposite-sex couples have been allowed\nto register as domestic partners. Nev. Rev. Stat. §§ 122A.100, 122A.010\net seq. Domestic partners are generally treated like married couples for\npurposes of rights and responsibilities—including with respect to\nchildren—under state law. However, domestic partners are denied nearly\nall of the benefits afforded married couples under federal law—including,\nsince Windsor, same-sex couples married under state law.\n\n     The fact that Nevada has seen fit to give same-sex couples the\nopportunity to enjoy the benefits afforded married couples by state law\nmakes its case for the constitutionality of its regime even weaker than\nIdaho’s. With the concrete differences in treatment gone, all that is left is\na message of disfavor. The Supreme Court has “repeatedly emphasized\n[that] discrimination itself, by perpetuating ‘archaic and stereotypic\nnotions’ or by stigmatizing members of the disfavored group as ‘innately\ninferior’ and therefore as less worthy participants,” can cause serious\n“injuries to those who are denied equal treatment solely because of their\nmembership in a disfavored group.” Heckler v. Mathews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111114\"><a href=\"/opinion/111114/heckler-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n739–40 (1984) (citation omitted).\n\n     If Nevada were concerned, as the Coalition purports it to be, that state\nrecognition of same-sex unions would make the institution of marriage\n“genderless” and thereby undermine opposite-sex spouses’ commitments\nto each other and their children, it would be ill-advised to permit opposite-\nsex couples to participate in the alternative domestic partnership regime\nit has established. However, Nevada does just that.\n\f26                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nthose laws. However, the laws at issue distinguish on their\nface between opposite-sex couples, who are permitted to\nmarry and whose out-of-state marriages are recognized, and\nsame-sex couples, who are not permitted to marry and whose\nmarriages are not recognized.

Hence, while the procreative capacity distinction that\ndefendants seek to draw could in theory represent a\njustification for the discrimination worked by the laws, it\ncannot overcome the inescapable conclusion that Idaho and\nNevada do discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\n    In SmithKline, we held that classifications on the basis of\nsexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny. 740 F.3d\nat 474. We explained:\n\n        In its words and its deed, Windsor established\n        a level of scrutiny for classifications based on\n        sexual orientation that is unquestionably\n        higher than rational basis review.

We also noted that Windsor declined to\nadopt the strong presumption in favor of constitutionality and\nthe heavy deference to legislative judgments characteristic of\nrational basis review. Id. at 483. We concluded:\n\n         Windsor requires that when state action\n         discriminates on the basis of sexual\n         orientation, we must examine its actual\n         purposes and carefully consider the resulting\n         inequality to ensure that our most\n         fundamental institutions neither send nor\n         reinforce messages of stigma or second-class\n         status.\n\nId.\n\n    We proceed by applying the law of our circuit regarding\nthe applicable level of scrutiny. Because Idaho and Nevada’s\nlaws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, that level\nis heightened scrutiny.\n\n                                    III.\n\n    Defendants argue that their marriage laws survive\nheightened scrutiny because they promote child welfare by\n\n  7\n    Although as discussed in the text, SmithKline instructs us to consider\nthe states’ actual reasons, and not post-hoc justifications, for enacting the\nlaws at issue, these actual reasons are hard to ascertain in this case. Some\nof the statutory and constitutional provisions before us were enacted by\nstate legislatures and some were enacted by voters, and we have been\ninformed by all parties that the legislative histories are sparse. We shall\nassume, therefore, that the justifications offered in defendants’ briefs were\nin fact the actual motivations for the laws.\n\f28                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\nencouraging optimal parenting. Governor Otter argues that\nsame-sex marriage “teaches everyone—married and\nunmarried, gay and straight, men and women, and all the\nchildren—that a child knowing and being reared by her\nmother and father is neither socially preferred nor officially\nencouraged.” Governor Otter seeks to have the state send the\nopposite message to all Idahoans: that a child reared by its\nbiological parents is socially preferred and officially\nencouraged.\n\n    This argument takes two related forms: First, defendants\nmake a “procreative channeling” argument: that the norms of\nopposite-sex marriage ensure that as many children as\npossible are raised by their married biological mothers and\nfathers. They claim that same-sex marriage will undermine\nthose existing norms, which encourage people in opposite-sex\nrelationships to place their children’s interests above their\nown and preserve intact family units, instead of pursuing their\nown emotional and sexual needs elsewhere. In short, they\nargue that allowing same-sex marriages will adversely affect\nopposite-sex marriage by reducing its appeal to heterosexuals,\nand will reduce the chance that accidental pregnancy will lead\nto marriage. Second, Governor Otter and the Coalition (but\nnot the state of Idaho) argue that limiting marriage to\nopposite-sex couples promotes child welfare because children\nare most likely to thrive if raised by two parents of opposite\nsexes, since, they assert, mothers and fathers have\n“complementary” approaches to parenting.8 Thus, they\n\n\n\n 8\n   These arguments are not novel. The Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group\n(BLAG) relied in part on similar contentions about procreative channeling\nand gender complementarity in its attempt to justify the federal Defense\nof Marriage Act, but the Court did not credit them.

OTTER\n\n“from its ancient social purposes and transformed into a\ngovernment-endorsed celebration of the private desires of two\nadults (regardless of gender) to unite their lives sexually,\nemotionally, and socially for as long as those personal desires\nlast.” Defendants struggle, however, to identify any means by\nwhich same-sex marriages will undermine these social\npurposes. They argue vehemently that same-sex marriage will\nharm existing and especially future opposite-sex couples and\ntheir children because the message communicated by the\nsocial institution of marriage will be lost.\n\n    As one of the Nevada plaintiffs’ experts testified, there is\nno empirical support for the idea that legalizing same-sex\nmarriage would harm—or indeed, affect—opposite-sex\nmarriages or relationships. That expert presented data from\nMassachusetts, a state which has permitted same-sex\nmarriage since 2004, showing no decrease in marriage rates\nor increase in divorce rates in the past decade.9 See Amicus\nBrief of Massachusetts et al. 23–27; see also Amicus Brief of\nAmerican Psychological Association et al. 8–13. It would\nseem that allowing couples who want to marry so badly that\nthey have endured years of litigation to win the right to do so\nwould reaffirm the state’s endorsement, without reservation,\nof spousal and parental commitment. From which aspect of\nsame-sex marriages, then, will opposite-sex couples intuit the\n\n\n\n 9\n   The Coalition takes issue with this conclusion, arguing that the effects\nof same-sex marriage might not manifest themselves for decades, because\n“something as massive and pervasive in our society and humanity as the\nman-woman marriage institution, like a massive ocean-going ship, does\nnot stop or turn in a short space or a short time.” Given that the\ndiscriminatory impact on individuals because of their sexual orientation\nis so harmful to them and their families, such unsupported speculation\ncannot justify the indefinite continuation of that discrimination.\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        31\n\ndestructive message defendants fear? Defendants offer only\nunpersuasive suggestions.\n\n    First, they argue that since same-sex families will not\ninclude both a father and a mother, a man who has a child\nwith a woman will conclude that his involvement in that\nchild’s life is not essential. They appear to contend that such\na father will see a child being raised by two women and\ndeduce that because the state has said it is unnecessary for\nthat child—who has two parents—to have a father, it is also\nunnecessary for his child to have a father. This proposition\nreflects a crass and callous view of parental love and the\nparental bond that is not worthy of response. We reject it out\nof hand.

However, the fear that an\nestablished institution will be undermined due to private\nopposition to its inclusive shift is not a legitimate basis for\nretaining the status quo. In United States v.

Because opposite-sex couples can\naccidentally conceive (and women may choose not to\nterminate unplanned pregnancies), so the argument goes,\nmarriage is important because it serves to bind such couples\ntogether and to their children. This makes some sense.\nDefendants’ argument runs off the rails, however, when they\n\n\n 11\n    He also states, in conclusory fashion, that allowing same-sex marriage\nwill lead opposite-sex couples to abuse alcohol and drugs, engage in\nextramarital affairs, take on demanding work schedules, and participate in\ntime-consuming hobbies. We seriously doubt that allowing committed\nsame-sex couples to settle down in legally recognized marriages will drive\nopposite-sex couples to sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll.\n\f34                           LATTA V. OTTER\n\nsuggest that marriage’s stabilizing and unifying force is\nunnecessary for same-sex couples, because they always\nchoose to conceive or adopt a child.12 As they themselves\nacknowledge, marriage not only brings a couple together at\nthe initial moment of union; it helps to keep them together,\n“from [that] day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for\npoorer, in sickness and in health.” Raising children is hard;\nmarriage supports same-sex couples in parenting their\nchildren, just as it does opposite-sex couples.\n\n    Moreover, marriage is not simply about procreation, but\nas much about\n\n           expressions of emotional support and public\n           commitment . . . . [M]any religions recognize\n           marriage as having spiritual significance; . . .\n\n 12\n      As Judge Richard Posner put it, bluntly:\n\n           [These states] think[] that straight couples tend to be\n           sexually irresponsible, producing unwanted children by\n           the carload, and so must be pressured . . . to marry, but\n           that gay couples, unable as they are to produce children\n           wanted or unwanted, are model parents—model\n           citizens really—so have no need for marriage.\n           Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing\n           unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to\n           marry.

We mention them to illustrate, by\ncontrast, just how tenuous any potential connection between\na ban on same-sex marriage and defendants’ asserted aims is.\nFor that reason alone, laws so poorly tailored as those before\nus cannot survive heightened scrutiny.\n\n    If defendants really wished to ensure that as many\nchildren as possible had married parents, they would do well\nto rescind the right to no-fault divorce, or to divorce\naltogether. Neither has done so. Such reforms might face\nconstitutional difficulties of their own, but they would at least\nfurther the states’ asserted interest in solidifying marriage.\nLikewise, if Idaho and Nevada want to increase the\npercentage of children being raised by their two biological\nparents, they might do better to ban assisted reproduction\nusing donor sperm or eggs, gestational surrogacy, and\nadoption, by both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, as well\nas by single people. Neither state does. See Idaho Code\n§§ 39-5401 et seq.; Nev. Rev.

A more likely explanation\nfor this expert’s findings is that when same-sex couples raise children,\nwhether adopted or conceived through the use of assisted reproductive\ntechnology, they have necessarily chosen to assume the financial,\ntemporal, and emotional obligations of parenthood. This does not lead,\nhowever, to the conclusion that these children, too, would not benefit from\ntheir parents’ marriage, just as children with opposite-sex parents do.\n\f38                     LATTA V.

Heightened\nscrutiny, however, demands more than speculation and\nconclusory assertions, especially when the assertions are of\nsuch little merit. Defendants have presented no evidence of\nany such effect. Indeed, they cannot even explain the manner\nin which, as they predict, children of opposite-sex couples\nwill be harmed. Their other contentions are equally without\nmerit. Because defendants have failed to demonstrate that\nthese laws further any legitimate purpose, they unjustifiably\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, and are in\nviolation of the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n    The official message of support that Governor Otter and\nthe Coalition wish to send in favor of opposite-sex marriage\nis equally unconstitutional, in that it necessarily serves to\nconvey a message of disfavor towards same-sex couples and\ntheir families.

Plaintiffs and defendants agree that\nthere is a fundamental right to marry, but defendants insist\nthat this right consists only of the right to marry an individual\nof the opposite sex. In Washington v. Glucksberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720–21 (1997), the Supreme Court explained “that the\nDue Process Clause specially protects those fundamental\nrights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in\nthis Nation’s history and tradition.” Our articulation of such\nfundamental rights must, we are told, be “carefully\nformulat[ed].” Id. at 722 (citations and quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n     However, “careful” does not mean “cramped.” Our task\nis to determine the scope of the fundamental right to marry as\ninferred from the principles set forth by the Supreme Court in\nits prior cases. Turner held that prisoners who had no children\nand no conjugal visits during which to conceive\nthem—people who could not be biological parents—had a\ndue process right to marry. 482 U.S. at 94–97. Zablocki held\nthat fathers with outstanding child support obligations—\npeople who were, at least according to adjudications in family\ncourt, unable to adequately provide for existing\nchildren—had a due process right to marry. 434 U.S. at\n383–87.\n\f                           LATTA V. OTTER                                47\n\n    In each case, the Supreme Court referred to—and\nconsidered the historical roots of—the general right of people\nto marry, rather than a narrower right defined in terms of\nthose who sought the ability to exercise it. These cases\nrejected status-based restrictions on marriage not by\nconsidering whether to recognize a new, narrow fundamental\nright (i.e., the right of prisoners to marry or the right of\nfathers with unpaid child support obligations to marry) or\ndetermining whether the class of people at issue enjoyed the\nright as it had previously been defined, but rather by deciding\nwhether there existed a sufficiently compelling justification\nfor depriving plaintiffs of the right they, as people,\npossessed.1 See id. at 384 (“[D]ecisions of this Court confirm\nthat the right to marry is of fundamental importance for all\nindividuals.”).\n\n    The third and oldest case in the fundamental right to\nmarry trilogy, Loving, is also the most directly on point. That\ncase held that Virginia’s anti-miscegenation laws, which\nprohibited and penalized interracial marriages, violated the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process\nClauses. 388 U.S. at 2–6. In a rhetorical stroke as\nuncomprehending as it is unavailing, defendants contend that\nlesbians and gays are not denied the freedom to marry by\nvirtue of the denial of their right to marry individuals of the\nsame sex, as they are still free to marry individuals of the\n\n 1\n   Turner and Zablocki illustrate another important point, pertinent to the\nadequacy of defendants’ justifications for curtailing the right. The first of\nthese cases involved plaintiffs whom the state was entitled to prevent from\nprocreating, and the second involved those who were unable to support\nexisting offspring financially. If the fundamental right to marry extends to\nthem, it certainly cannot be limited only to those who can procreate or to\nthose who, in the eyes of the state, would form part of an ideal parenting\nunit.\n\f48                         LATTA V. OTTER\n\nopposite sex. Defendants assert that their same-sex marriage\nbans are unlike the laws in Turner and Zablocki because they\ndo not categorically bar people with a particular characteristic\nfrom marrying, but rather limit whom lesbians and gays, and\nall other persons, may marry. However, Loving itself squarely\nrebuts this argument. Mildred Jeter and Richard Loving were\nnot barred from marriage altogether. Jeter was perfectly free\nto marry a black person, and Loving was perfectly free to\nmarry a white person. They were each denied the freedom,\nhowever, to marry the person whom they chose—the other.\nThe case of lesbians and gays is indistinguishable. A\nlimitation on the right to marry another person, whether on\naccount of race or for any other reason, is a limitation on the\nright to marry.2\n\n    Defendants urge that “man-woman” and “genderless”\nmarriage are mutually exclusive, and that permitting the latter\nwill “likely destroy[]” the former. Quite the opposite is true.\nLoving teaches that Virginia’s anti-miscegenation laws did\nnot simply “deprive the Lovings of liberty without due\nprocess of law.” 388 U.S. at 12. They did far worse; as the\nCourt declared, the laws also “surely . . . deprive[d] all the\nState’s citizens of liberty without due process of law.” Id.\n(emphasis added). When Virginia told Virginians that they\nwere not free to marry the one they loved if that person was\n\n\n      2\n        Defendants are apparently concerned that if we recognize a\nfundamental right to marry the person of one’s choice, this conclusion will\nnecessarily lead to the invalidation of bans on incest, polygamy, and child\nmarriage. However, fundamental rights may sometimes permissibly be\nabridged: when the laws at issue further compelling state interests, to\nwhich they are narrowly tailored. Although such claims are not before us,\nit is not difficult to envision that states could proffer substantially more\ncompelling justifications for such laws than have been put forward in\nsupport of the same-sex marriage bans at issue here.\n\f                       LATTA V.

As the Court has explained,\n“[p]articularly in the case of defining the term ‘discrimination,’” Title VII\nmust be interpreted consistently with Fourteenth Amendment equal\nprotection principles, because Congress does not define “discrimination”\nin Title VII. See Gilbert, 429 U.S. at 133; see also 42 U.S.C. § 2000e.

Either way, the\nclassification is one that limits the affected individuals’\nopportunities based on their sex, as compared to the sex of the\nother people involved in the arrangement or transaction.\n\n    As Justice Johnson of the Vermont Supreme Court noted,\nthe same-sex marriage prohibitions, if anything, classify more\nobviously on the basis of sex than they do on the basis of\nsexual orientation: “A woman is denied the right to marry\nanother woman because her would-be partner is a woman, not\nbecause one or both are lesbians. . . . [S]exual orientation\n\n 4\n   Dothard in fact dealt with a regulation that applied equally to men and\nwomen. See 433 U.S. at 332 n. 16 (“By its terms [the regulation at issue]\napplies to contact positions in both male and female institutions.”); see\nalso id. at 325 n. 6. Dothard ultimately upheld the sex-based\ndiscrimination at issue under Title VII’s “bona fide occupational\nqualification” exception, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(e), because of the especially\nviolent, sexually charged nature of the particular prisons involved in that\ncase, and because the regulation applied only to correctional officers in\n“contact positions” (i.e. working in close physical proximity to inmates)\nin maximum security institutions.

While the same-sex marriage\nprohibitions obviously operate to the disadvantage of the people likely to\nwish to marry someone of the same gender—i.e. lesbians, gay men,\nbisexuals, and otherwise-identified persons with same-sex attraction—the\nindividuals’ actual orientation is irrelevant to the application of the laws.\n\f56                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nDothard also involved a facial sex classification intertwined\nwith presumptions about sexual orientation, in that instance\nheterosexuality. The Supreme Court in Dothard agreed that\nthe state was justified in permitting only male officers to\nguard male inmates, because there was “a real risk that other\ninmates, deprived of a normal heterosexual environment,\nwould assault women guards because they were women.”\n433 U.S. at 335. Thus, Dothard’s reasoning confirms the\nobvious: a statute that imposes a sex qualification, whether\nfor a marriage license or a job application, is sex\ndiscrimination, pure and simple, even where assumptions\nabout sexual orientation are also at play.\n\n    Lawrence v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130160\"><a href=\"/opinion/130160/lawrence-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003) also underscores\nwhy the continuation of the same-sex marriage prohibitions\ntoday is quite obviously about gender. Lawrence held that it\nviolates due process for states to criminalize consensual,\nnoncommercial same-sex sexual activity that occurs in\nprivate between two unrelated adults. See id. at 578. After\nLawrence, then, the continuation of the same-sex marriage\nbans necessarily turns on the gender identity of the spouses,\nnot the sexual activity they may engage in. To attempt to bar\nthat activity would be unconstitutional. See id. The Nevada\nintervenors recognize as much, noting that Lawrence\n“differentiates between the fundamental right of gay men and\nlesbians to enter an intimate relationship, on one hand, and,\non the other hand, the right to marry a member of one’s own\nsex.” The “right to marry a member of one’s own sex”\nexpressly turns on sex.\n\n    B. In concluding that these laws facially classify on the\nbasis of gender, it is of no moment that the prohibitions “treat\nmen as a class and women as a class equally” and in that\n\f                           LATTA V.

In that\ncase, the parties recognized that women, as a class, lived\nlonger than men. Id. at 707–09. The defendant Department\nargued that this fact justified a policy that facially required all\nwomen to contribute larger monthly sums to their retirement\nplans than men, out of fairness to men as a class, who\notherwise would subsidize women as a class. Id. at 708–09.\nManhart rejected this justification for the sex distinction,\nexplaining that the relevant focus must be “on fairness to\nindividuals rather than fairness to classes,” and held,\naccordingly, that the policy was unquestionably sex\ndiscriminatory. Id. at 709, 711.\n\n    Under all these precedents, it is simply irrelevant that the\nsame-sex marriage prohibitions privilege neither gender as a\nwhole or on average. Laws that strip individuals of their\nrights or restrict personal choices or opportunities solely on\nthe basis of the individuals’ gender are sex discriminatory and\nmust be subjected to intermediate scrutiny. See J.E.B.,\n511 U.S. at 140–42. Accordingly, I would hold that Idaho\nand Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions facially\nclassify on the basis of gender, and that the “equal\n\f60                         LATTA V.

The same-sex marriage prohibitions also constitute\nsex discrimination for the alternative reason that they\nimpermissibly prescribe different treatment for similarly\nsituated subgroups of men and women. That is, the same-sex\nmarriage laws treat the subgroup of men who wish to marry\nmen less favorably than the otherwise similarly situated\nsubgroup of women who want to marry men.

They must be\nreviewed under intermediate scrutiny.\n\f62                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\n    D. One further point bears mention. The defendants note\nthat the Supreme Court summarily rejected an equal\nprotection challenge to a same-sex marriage bar in Baker v.\nNelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), holding there was no substantial\nfederal question presented in that case. But the Court did not\nclarify that sex-based classifications receive intermediate\nscrutiny until 1976. See Craig, 429 U.S. at 221, 218\n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (describing the level of review\nprescribed by the majority as “new,” and as “an elevated or\n‘intermediate’ level scrutiny”). As this fundamental doctrinal\nchange postdates Baker, Baker is no longer binding as to the\nsex discrimination analysis, just as it is no longer binding as\nto the sexual orientation discrimination analysis. See Op. Ct.\nat 22–24.\n\n     II. Same-Sex Marriage Bars Are Based in Gender\n         Stereotypes\n\n    Idaho and Nevada’s same sex marriage laws not only\nclassify on the basis of sex but also, implicitly and explicitly,\ndraw on “archaic and stereotypic notions” about the\npurportedly distinctive roles and abilities of men and women.\nEradicating the legal impact of such stereotypes has been a\ncentral concern of constitutional sex-discrimination\njurisprudence for the last several decades.

By doing so, the laws enforce the state’s view that\nmen and women “naturally” behave differently from one\nanother in marriage and as parents.\n\n     The defendants, for example, assert that “gender diversity\nor complementarity among parents . . . provides important\nbenefits” to children, because “mothers and fathers tend on\naverage to parent differently and thus make unique\ncontributions to the child’s overall development.” The\ndefendants similarly assert that “[t]he man-woman meaning\nat the core of the marriage institution, reinforced by the law,\nhas always recognized, valorized, and made normative the\nroles of ‘mother’ and ‘father’ and their uniting,\ncomplementary roles in raising their offspring.”\n\n    Viewed through the prism of the Supreme Court’s\ncontemporary anti-stereotyping sex discrimination doctrine,\nthese proferred justifications simply underscore that the\nsame-sex marriage prohibitions discriminate on the basis of\nsex, not only in their form—which, as I have said, is\nsufficient in itself—but also in reviving the very infirmities\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                         65\n\nthat led the Supreme Court to adopt an intermediate scrutiny\nstandard for sex classifications in the first place. I so\nconclude for two, somewhat independent, reasons.\n\n    A. First, and more obviously, the gender stereotyping at\nthe core of the same-sex marriage prohibitions clarifies that\nthose laws affect men and women in basically the same way\nas, not in a fundamentally different manner from, a wide\nrange of laws and policies that have been viewed consistently\nas discrimination based on sex. As has been repeated again\nand again, legislating on the basis of such stereotypes limits,\nand is meant to limit, the choices men and women make\nabout the trajectory of their own lives, choices about work,\nparenting, dress, driving—and yes, marriage. This focus in\nmodern sex discrimination law on the preservation of the\nability freely to make individual life choices regardless of\none’s sex confirms that sex discrimination operates at, and\nmust be justified at, the level of individuals, not at the broad\nclass level of all men and women. Because the same-sex\nmarriage prohibitions restrict individuals’ choices on the\nbasis of sex, they discriminate based on sex for purposes of\nconstitutional analysis precisely to the same degree as other\nstatutes that infringe on such choices—whether by\ndistributing benefits or by restricting behavior—on that same\nground.\n\n    B. Second, the long line of cases since 1971 invalidating\nvarious laws and policies that categorized by sex have been\npart of a transformation that has altered the very institution at\nthe heart of this case, marriage.             Reviewing that\ntransformation, including the role played by constitutional\nsex discrimination challenges in bringing it about, reveals that\nthe same sex marriage prohibitions seek to preserve an\noutmoded, sex-role-based vision of the marriage institution,\n\f66                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nand in that sense as well raise the very concerns that gave rise\nto the contemporary constitutional approach to sex\ndiscrimination.\n\n    (i) Historically, marriage was a profoundly unequal\ninstitution, one that imposed distinctly different rights and\nobligations on men and women. The law of coverture, for\nexample, deemed the “the husband and wife . . . one person,”\nsuch that “the very being or legal existence of the woman\n[was] suspended . . . or at least [was] incorporated and\nconsolidated into that of the husband” during the marriage.\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England\n441 (3d rev. ed. 1884). Under the principles of coverture, “a\nmarried woman [was] incapable, without her husband’s\nconsent, of making contracts . . . binding on her or him.”\nBradwell v.

She could not sue or be sued without her\nhusband’s consent. See, e.g., Nancy F. Cott, Public Vows: A\nHistory of Marriage and the Nation 11–12 (2000). Married\nwomen also could not serve as the legal guardians of their\nchildren. Frontiero v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108781\"><a href=\"/opinion/108781/frontiero-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 685 (1973)\n(plurality op.).\n\n    Marriage laws further dictated economically disparate\nroles for husband and wife. In many respects, the marital\ncontract was primarily understood as an economic\narrangement between spouses, whether or not the couple had\nor would have children. “Coverture expressed the legal\nessence of marriage as reciprocal: a husband was bound to\nsupport his wife, and in exchange she gave over her property\nand labor.” Cott, Public Vows, at 54. That is why “married\nwomen traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or\nconvey property . . . .” Frontiero, 411 U.S. at 685. Notably,\nhusbands owed their wives support even if there were no\n\f                        LATTA V. OTTER                          67\n\nchildren of the marriage. See, e.g., Hendrik Hartog, Man and\nWife in America: A History 156 (2000).\n\n    There was also a significant disparity between the rights\nof husbands and wives with regard to physical intimacy. At\ncommon law, “a woman was the sexual property of her\nhusband; that is, she had a duty to have intercourse with\nhim.” John D’Emilio & Estelle B. Freedman, Intimate\nMatters: A History of Sexuality in America 79 (3d ed. 2012).\nQuite literally, a wife was legally “the possession of her\nhusband, . . . [her] husband’s property.” Hartog, Man and\nWife in America, at 137. Accordingly, a husband could sue\nhis wife’s lover in tort for “entic[ing]” her or “alienat[ing]”\nher affections and thereby interfering with his property rights\nin her body and her labor. Id. A husband’s possessory\ninterest in his wife was undoubtedly also driven by the fact\nthat, historically, marriage was the only legal site for licit sex;\nsex outside of marriage was almost universally criminalized.\nSee, e.g., Ariela R. Dubler, Immoral Purposes: Marriage and\nthe Genus of Illicit Sex, 115 Yale L.J. 756, 763–64 (2006).\n\n    Notably, although sex was strongly presumed to be an\nessential part of marriage, the ability to procreate was\ngenerally not. See, e.g., Chester Vernier, American Family\nLaws: A Comparative Study of the Family Law of the Forty-\nEight American States, Alaska, the District of Columbia, and\nHawaii (to Jan. 1, 1931) (1931) I § 50, 239–46 (at time of\nsurvey, grounds for annulment typically included impotency,\nas well as incapacity due to minority or “non-age”; lack of\nunderstanding and insanity; force or duress; fraud; disease;\nand incest; but not inability to conceive); II § 68, at 38–39\n(1932) (at time of survey, grounds for divorce included\n“impotence”; vast majority of states “generally held that\nimpotence . . . does not mean sterility but must be of such a\n\f68                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nnature as to render complete sexual intercourse practically\nimpossible”; and only Pennsylvania “ma[d]e sterility a cause”\nfor divorce).\n\n    The common law also dictated that it was legally\nimpossible for a man to rape his wife. Men could not be\nprosecuted for spousal rape. A husband’s “incapacity” to\nrape his wife was justified by the theory that “‘the marriage\nconstitute[d] a blanket consent to sexual intimacy which the\nwoman [could] revoke only by dissolving the marital\nrelationship.’” See, e.g., Jill Elaine Hasday, Contest and\nConsent: A Legal History of Marital Rape, 88 Calif. L. Rev\n1373, 1376 n. 9 (2000) (quoting Model Penal Code and\nCommentaries, § 213.1 cmt. 8(c), at 342 (Official Draft and\nRevised Comments 1980)).\n\n    Concomitantly, dissolving the marital partnership via\ndivorce was exceedingly difficult. Through the mid-twentieth\ncentury, divorce could be obtained only on a limited set of\ngrounds, if at all. At the beginning of our nation’s history,\nseveral states did not permit full divorce except under the\nnarrowest of circumstances; separation alone was the remedy,\neven if a woman could show “cruelty endangering life or\nlimb.” Peter W. Bardaglio, Reconstrucing the Household:\nFamilies, Sex, and the Law in the Nineteenth-Century South\n33 (1995); see also id. 32–33. In part, this policy dovetailed\nwith the grim fact that, at English common law, and in\nseveral states through the beginning of the nineteenth century,\n“a husband’s prerogative to chastise his wife”—that is, to\nbeat her short of permanent injury—was recognized as his\nmarital right. Reva B. Siegel, “The Rule of Love”: Wife\nBeating as Prerogative and Privacy, 105 Yale L.J. 2117,\n2125 (1996).\n\f                      LATTA V. OTTER                        69\n\n     Perhaps unsurprisingly, the profoundly unequal status of\nmen and women in marriage was frequently cited as\njustification for denying women equal rights in other arenas,\nincluding the workplace. “[S]tate courts made clear that the\nbasis, and validity, of such laws lay in stereotypical beliefs\nabout the appropriate roles of men and women.” Hibbs v.\nDep’t of Human Res., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775824\"><a href=\"/opinion/775824/william-hibbs-united-states-of-america-intervenor-v-department-of-human/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864 (9th Cir. 2001), aff’d\nsub nom.

Justice Bradley infamously opined in 1887 that “the\ncivil law, as well as nature herself, has always recognized a\nwide difference in the respective spheres and destinies of man\nand woman.” Bradwell, 83 U.S. at 141 (Bradley, J.,\nconcurring). On this view, women could be excluded from\nvarious professions because “[t]he natural and proper timidity\nand delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits\nit for many of the occupations of civil life.” Id. Instead, the\nlaw gave effect to the belief that “[t]he paramount destiny and\nmission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices\nof wife and mother.” Id.\n\n    As a result of this separate-spheres regime,\n“‘[h]istorically, denial or curtailment of women’s\nemployment opportunities has been traceable directly to the\npervasive presumption that women are mothers first, and\nworkers second.’ . . . Stereotypes about women’s domestic\nroles [we]re reinforced by parallel stereotypes presuming a\nlack of domestic responsibilities for men.” Hibbs, 538 U.S.\nat 736 (quoting the Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on\nLabor–Management Relations and the Subcommittee on\nLabor Standards of the House Committee on Education and\nLabor, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., at 100 (1986)). Likewise, social\nbenefits programs historically distinguished between men and\nwomen on the assumption, grounded in the unequal marital\nstatus of men and women, that women were more likely to be\n\f70                    LATTA V.

See, e.g., Reva\nB. Siegel, The Modernization of Marital Status Law:\nAdjudicating Wives’ Rights to Earnings, 1860–1930, 82 Geo.\nL. Rev. 2127(1994). Eventually, state legislatures revised\ntheir laws. Today, of course, a married woman may enter\ncontracts, sue and be sued without her husband’s\nparticipation, and own and convey property. The advent of\n“no fault” divorce regimes in the late 1960s and early 1970s\nmade marital dissolutions more common, and legislatures\nalso directed family courts to impose child and spousal\nsupport obligations on divorcing couples without regard to\ngender. See Cott, Public Vows, at 205–06. As these\nlegislative reforms were taking hold, “in 1971 . . . the Court\nf[ou]nd for the first time that a state law violated the Equal\nProtection Clause because it arbitrarily discriminated on the\nbasis of sex.” Hibbs, 273 F.3d at 865 (citing Reed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108404\"><a href=\"/opinion/108404/reed-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">).\n\n    This same legal transformation extended into the marital\n(and nonmarital) bedroom.          Spousal rape has been\ncriminalized in all states since 1993.

More recently, Lawrence\nclarified that licit, consensual sexual behavior is no longer\nconfined to marriage, but is protected when it occurs, in\nprivate, between two consenting adults, regardless of their\ngender. See 539 U.S. at 578.\n\n    In the child custody context, mothers and fathers today\nare generally presumed to be equally fit parents. See, e.g.,\nCott, Public Vows, at 206. Stanley v.

Likewise, both\nspouses in a marriage are now entitled to economic support\nwithout regard to gender. See Cott, at 206–07. Once again,\nequal protection adjudication contributed to this change: Orr,\n440 U.S. at 278–79, struck down a state statutory scheme\nimposing alimony obligations on husbands but not wives.\n\n    In short, a combination of constitutional sex-\ndiscrimination adjudication, legislative changes, and social\nand cultural transformation has, in a sense, already rendered\ncontemporary marriage “genderless,” to use the phrase\nfavored by the defendants. See Op. Ct. at 25 n. 6. For, as a\nresult of these transformative social, legislative, and doctrinal\ndevelopments, “[g]ender no longer forms an essential part of\nmarriage; marriage under law is a union of equals.” Perry,\n704 F. Supp. 2d at 993. As a result, in the states that\ncurrently ban same-sex marriage, the legal norms that\ncurrently govern the institution of marriage are “genderless”\nin every resepect except the requirement that would-be\n\f72                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nspouses be of different genders. With that exception, Idaho\nand Nevada’s marriage regimes have jettisoned the rigid roles\nmarriage as an institution once prescribed for men and\nwomen. In sum, “the sex-based classification contained in\nthe[se] marriage laws,” as the only gender classification that\npersists in some states’ marriage statutes, is, at best, “a\nvestige of sex-role stereotyping” that long plagued marital\nregimes before the modern era, see Baker, 744 A.2d at 906\n(Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and,\nat worst, an attempt to reintroduce gender roles.\n\n    The same-sex marriage bars constitute gender\ndiscrimination both facially and when recognized, in their\nhistorical context, both as resting on sex stereotyping and as\na vestige of the sex-based legal rules once imbedded in the\ninstitution of marriage. They must be subject to intermediate\nscrutiny.\n\n     III.   Idaho and Nevada’s Same-Sex Marriage\n            Prohibitions Fail Under Intermediate Scrutiny\n\n    For Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage prohibitions\nto survive the intermediate scrutiny applicable to sex\ndiscriminatory laws, it must be shown that these laws “serve\nimportant governmental objectives and [are] substantially\nrelated to achievement of those objectives.” Craig, 429 U.S.\nat 197. “The purpose of requiring that close relationship is to\nassure that the validity of a classification is determined\nthrough reasoned analysis rather than through the mechanical\napplication of traditional, often inaccurate, assumptions about\nthe proper roles of men and women.” Hogan, 458 U.S. at\n725–26.\n\f                            LATTA V. OTTER                                73\n\n    In part, the interests advanced by the defendants fail\nbecause they are interests in promoting and enforcing gender\nstereotyping and so simply are not legitimate governmental\ninterests. And even if we assume that the other governmental\nobjectives cited by the defendants are legitimate and\nimportant, the defendants have not shown that the same-sex\nmarriage prohibitions are substantially related to achieving\nany of them.\n\n    The asserted interests fall into roughly three categories:\n(1) ensuring children are raised by parents who provide them\nwith the purported benefits of “gender complementarity,” also\nreferred to as “gender diversity”; (2) “furthering the stability\nof family structures through benefits targeted at couples\npossessing biological procreative capacity,” and/or\ndiscouraging “motherlessness” or “fatherlessness in the\nhome”; and (3) promoting a “child-centric” rather than\n“adult-centric” model of marriage.”8 The defendants insist\nthat “genderless marriage run[s] counter to . . . [these] norms\nand ideals,” which is why “man-woman marriage” must be\npreserved.\n\n\n\n\n    8\n        The defendants also assert that the state has an interest in\n“accommodating religious freedom and reducing the potential for civic\nstrife.” But, as the Opinion of the Court notes, even if allowing same-sex\nmarriage were likely to lead to religious strife, which is highly doubtful,\nto say the least, that fact would not justify the denial of equal protection\ninherent in the gender-based classification of the same-sex marriage bars.\nSee Watson v. City of Memphis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106626\"><a href=\"/opinion/106626/watson-v-memphis/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (1963) (rejecting the\ncity’s proffered justification that delay in desegregating park facilities was\nnecessary to avoid interracial “turmoil,” and explaining “constitutional\nrights may not be denied simply because of hostility to their assertion or\nexercise”).\n\f74                      LATTA V. OTTER\n\n    The Opinion of the Court thoroughly demonstrates why\nall of these interests are without merit as justifications for\nsexual orientation discrimination. I add this brief analysis\nonly to show that the justifications are likewise wholly\ninsufficient under intermediate scrutiny to support the sex-\nbased classifications at the core of these laws.\n\n    A. The Idaho defendants assert that the state has an\ninterest in ensuring children have the benefit of parental\n“gender complementarity.” There must be “space in the law\nfor the distinct role of ‘mother’ [and] the distinct role of\n‘father’ and therefore of their united, complementary role in\nraising offspring,” the Idaho defendants insist. On a slightly\ndifferent tack, the Nevada intervenors similarly opine that\n“[s]ociety has long recognized that diversity in education\nbrings a host of benefits to students,” and ask, “[i]f that is true\nin education, why not in parenting?”\n\n    Under the constitutional sex-discrimination jurisprudence\nof the last forty years, neither of these purported justifications\ncan possibly pass muster as a justification for sex\ndiscrimination. Indeed, these justifications are laden with the\nvery “‘baggage of sexual stereotypes’” the Supreme Court\nhas repeatedly disavowed. Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.S. at\n89 (quoting Orr, 440 U.S. at 283).\n\n    (i) It should be obvious that the stereotypic notion “that\nthe two sexes bring different talents to the parenting\nenterprise,” runs directly afoul of the Supreme Court’s\nrepeated disapproval of “generalizations about ‘the way\nwomen are,’” VMI, 518 U.S. at 550, or “the way men are,” as\na basis for legislation. Just as Orr, 440 U.S. at 279–80,\nrejected gender-disparate alimony statutes “as effectively\nannouncing the State’s preference for an allocation of family\n\f                          LATTA V. OTTER                              75\n\nresponsibilities under which the wife plays a dependent role,”\nso a state preference for supposed gender-specific parenting\nstyles cannot serve as a legitimate reason for a sex-based\nclassification.\n\n    This conclusion would follow “[e]ven [if] some statistical\nsupport can be conjured up for the generalization” that men\nand women behave differently as marital partners and/or\nparents, because laws that rely on gendered stereotypes about\nhow men and women behave (or should behave) must be\nreviewed under intermediate scrutiny. See J.E.B., 511 U.S.\nat 140. It has even greater force where, as here, the supposed\ndifference in parenting styles lacks reliable empirical support,\neven “on average.”9 Communicating such archaic gender-\nrole stereotypes to children, or to parents and potential\nparents, is not a legitimate governmental interest, much less\na substantial one.\n\n    (ii) The assertion that preserving “man-woman marriage”\nis permissible because the state has a substantial interest in\npromoting “diversity” has no more merit than the “gender\ncomplementarity” justification. Diversity is assuredly a\nweighty interest in the context of public educational\ninstitutions, with hundreds or thousands of individuals. But\n“[t]he goal of community diversity has no place . . . as a\nrequirement of marriage,” which, by law, is a private\ninstitution consisting only of two persons. Baker v. State,\n744 A.2d at 910 (Johnson, J., concurring in part and\ndissenting in part). “To begin with, carried to its logical\n\n\n  9\n    As one of the plaintiffs’ expert psychologists, Dr. Michael Lamb,\nexplained, “[t]here . . . is no empirical support for the notion that the\npresence of both male and female role models in the home enhances the\nadjustment of children and adolescents.”\n\f76                     LATTA V. OTTER\n\nconclusion, the [Nevada intervenors’] rationale could require\nall marriages to be between [two partners], not just of the\nopposite sex, but of different races, religions, national origins,\nand so forth, to promote diversity.” Id. Such an absurd\nrequirement would obviously be unconstitutional. See\nLoving, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107480\"><a href=\"/opinion/107480/loving-v-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n     Moreover, even if it were true that, on average, women\nand men have different perspectives on some issues because\nof different life experiences, individual couples are at least as\nlikely to exhibit conformity as diversity of personal\ncharacteristics. Sociological research suggests that individual\nmarried couples are more likely to be similar to each other in\nterms of political ideology, educational background, and\neconomic background than they are to be dissimilar; despite\nthe common saying that “opposites attract,” in actuality it\nappears that “like attracts like.” See, e.g., John R. Alford et\nal., The Politics of Mate Choice, 73:2 J. Politics 362, 376\n(2011) (“[S]pousal concordance in the realm of social and\npolitical attitudes is extremely high.”); Jeremy Greenwood et\nal., Marry Your Like: Assortative Mating and Income\nInequality (Population Studies Ctr., Univ. Of Penn., Working\nPaper No. 14-1, at 1, 2014) (Since the 1960s, “the degree of\nassortative mating [with regard to educational level] has\nincreased.”). Further, there is no evidence of which I am\naware that gender is a better predictor of diversity of\nviewpoints or of parenting styles than other characteristics.\nSuch “gross generalizations that would be deemed\nimpermissible if made on the basis of race [do not become]\nsomehow permissible when made on the basis of gender.”\nJ.E.B., 511 U.S. at 139–40.\n\n   In short, the defendants’ asserted state interests in “gender\ncomplementarity” and “gender diversity” are not legitimate\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                        77\n\n“important governmental objectives.” See Craig, 429 U.S. at\n197. Accordingly, I do not address whether excluding same-\nsex couples from marriage is substantially related to this goal.\n\n    B. The defendants also argue that their states have an\nimportant interest in “encouraging marriage between\nopposite-sex partners” who have biological children, so that\nthose children are raised in an intact marriage rather than in\na cohabiting or single-parent household. Assuming that this\npurpose is in fact a “important governmental objective,” the\ndefendants have entirely failed to explain how excluding\nsame-sex couples from marriage is substantially related to\nachieving the objective of furthering family stability.\n\n     (i) I will interpret the asserted state goal in preventing\n“fatherlessness” and “motherlessness” broadly. That is, I\nshall assume that the states want to discourage parents from\nabandoning their children by encouraging dual parenting over\nsingle parenting. If the asserted purpose were instead read\nnarrowly, as an interest in ensuring that a child has both a\nmother and a father in the home (rather than two mothers or\ntwo fathers), the justification would amount to the same\njustification as the asserted interest in “gender\ncomplementarity,” and would fail for the same reason. That\nis, the narrower version of the family stability justification\nrests on impermissible gender stereotypes about the relative\ncapacities of men and women.\n\n    Discouraging single parenting by excluding same-sex\ncouples from marriage is oxymoronic, in the sense that it will\nlikely achieve exactly the opposite of what the states say they\nseek to accomplish. The defendants’ own evidence suggests\nthat excluding same-sex couples from marriage renders their\n\f78                       LATTA V. OTTER\n\nunions less stable, increasing the risk that the children of\nthose couples will be raised by one parent rather than two.\n\n    True, an increasing number of children are now born and\nraised outside of marriage, a development that may well be\nundesirable.10 But that trend began apace well before the\nadvent of same-sex marriage and has been driven by entirely\ndifferent social and legal developments. The trend can be\ntraced to declines in marriage rates, as well as to the rise in\ndivorce rates after the enactment of “no fault” divorce\nregimes in the late 1960s and early 1970s. “The proportion\nof adults who declined to marry at all rose substantially\nbetween 1972 and 1998 . . . . [In the same period,] [t]he\ndivorce rate rose more furiously, to equal more than half the\nmarriage rate, portending that at least one in two marriages\nwould end in divorce.” Cott, Public Vows, at 203. The\ndefendants’ assertion that excluding same-sex couples from\nmarriage will do anything to reverse these trends is utterly\nunsubstantiated.\n\n    (ii) The defendants’ appeal to biology is similarly\nwithout merit. Their core assertion is that the states have a\nsubstantial interest in channeling opposite-sex couples into\nmarriage, so that any accidentally produced children are more\nlikely to be raised in a two-parent household. But the\nexclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and\nobligations of state-sanctioned marriage is assuredly not\n\n     10\n       According to the defendants, “[b]etween 1970 and 2005, the\nproportion of children living with two married parents dropped from 85\npercent to 68 percent,” and as of 2008, “[m]ore than a third of all U.S.\nchildren [were] . . . born outside of wedlock.” See Benjamin Scafidi,\nInstitute for American Values, The Taxpayer Costs of Divorce and Unwed\nChildbearing: First-Ever Estimates for the Nation and All Fifty States 7\n(2008).\n\f                       LATTA V. OTTER                        79\n\n“substantially related,” Craig, 429 U.S. at 197, to achieving\nthat goal.\n\n    The reason only opposite-sex couples should be allowed\nto marry, we are told by the defendants, is that they “possess\nthe unique ability to create new life.” But both same-sex and\nopposite-sex couples can and do produce children\nbiologically related only to one member of the couple, via\nassisted reproductive technology or otherwise. And both\nsame-sex and opposite-sex couples adopt children, belying\nthe notion that the two groups necessarily differ as to their\nbiological connection to the children they rear.\n\n    More importantly, the defendants “cannot explain how the\nfailure of opposite-sex couples to accept responsibility for the\nchildren they create relates at all to the exclusion of same-sex\ncouples from the benefits of marriage.” Baker, 744 A.2d at\n911 (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nFor one thing, marriage has never been restricted to opposite-\nsex couples able to procreate; as noted earlier, the spousal\nrelationship, economic and otherwise, has always been\nunderstood as a sufficient basis for state approval and\nregulation. See supra pp. 65–68. For another, to justify sex\ndiscrimination, the state must explain why the discriminatory\nfeature is closely related to the state interest. See Hogan,\n458 U.S. at 725–26. The states thus would have to explain,\nwithout reliance on sex-stereotypical notions, why the bans\non same-sex marriage advance their interests in inducing\nmore biological parents to marry each other. No such\nshowing has been or can be made.\n\n   Biological parents’ inducements to marry will remain\nexactly what they have always been if same-sex couples can\nmarry. The legal benefits of marriage—taxation, spousal\n\f80                    LATTA V. OTTER\n\nsupport, inheritance rights, familial rights to make decisions\nconcerning the illness and death of a spouse, and so on—will\nnot change. See, e.g., Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 95–96\n(1987). The only change will be that now-excluded couples\nwill enjoy the same rights. As the sex-based exclusion of\nsame-sex couples from marrying does not in any way\nenhance the marriage benefits available to opposite-sex\ncouples, that exclusion does not substantially advance—or\nadvance at all—the state interest in inducing opposite-sex\ncouples to raise their biological children within a stable\nmarriage.\n\n    (iii) Finally, the defendants argue that “the traditional\nmarriage institution” or “man-woman marriage . . . is\nrelatively but decidedly more child-centric” than “genderless\nmarriage,” which they insist is “relatively but decidedly more\nadult-centric.”\n\n    These assertions are belied by history. As I have noted,\nsee supra pp. 65–71, “traditional marriage” was in fact quite\n“adult-centric.” Marriage was, above all, an economic\narrangement between spouses. See, e.g., Cott, Public Vows,\nat 54. Whether or not there were children, the law imposed\nsupport obligations, inheritance rules, and other rights and\nburdens upon married men and women. Moreover, couples\nunwilling or unable to procreate have never been prevented\nfrom marrying. Nor was infertility generally recognized as a\nground for divorce or annulment under the old fault-based\nregime, even though sexual impotence was. See, e.g.,\nVernier, I §50, II § 68.\n\n   Further, the social concept of “companionate\nmarriage”—that is, legal marriage for companionship\npurposes without the possibility of children—has existed\n\f                         LATTA V. OTTER                             81\n\nsince at least the 1920s. See Christina Simmons, Making\nMarriage Modern: Women’s Sexuality from the Progressive\nEra to World War II 121 (2009). The Supreme Court called\non this concept when it recognized the right of married\ncouples to use contraception in 1965. Griswold, 381 U.S. at\n486. Griswold reasoned that, with or without procreation,\nmarriage was “an association for as noble a purpose as any.”\nId.\n\n   Same-sex marriage is thus not inherently less “child-\ncentric” than “traditional marriage.”11 In both versions, the\ncouple may bear or adopt and raise children, or not.\n\n    Finally, a related notion the defendants advance, that\nallowing same-sex marriage will render the marriage\ninstitution “genderless,” in the sense that gender roles within\nopposite-sex marriages will be altered, is also ahistorical. As\nI have explained, those roles have already been profoundly\naltered by social, legislative, and adjudicative changes. All\nthese changes were adopted toward the end of eliminating\nthe gender-role impositions that previously inhered in the\nlegal regulation of marriage.\n\n    In short, the “child-centric”/“adult-centric” distinction is\nan entirely ephemeral one, at odds with the current realities\nof marriage as an institution. There is simply no substantial\n\n\n\n 11\n     Moreover, if the assertion that same-sex marriages are more “adult-\ncentric” is meant to imply state disapproval of the sexual activity\npresumed to occur in same-sex marriages, that disapproval could not be\na legitimate state purpose. After Lawrence, the right to engage in same-\nsex sexual activity is recognized as a protected liberty interest. See\n539 U.S. at 578.\n\f82                       LATTA V. OTTER\n\nrelationship between discouraging an “adult-centric” model\nof marriage and excluding same-sex couples.\n\n     IV. Conclusion\n\n    “Intentional discrimination on the basis of gender by state\nactors violates the Equal Protection Clause, particularly\nwhere, as here, the discrimination serves to ratify and\nperpetuate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes\nabout the relative abilities of men and women.” J.E.B.,\n511 U.S. at 130–31. Idaho and Nevada’s same-sex marriage\nproscriptions are sex based, and these bans do serve to\npreserve “invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes”\nconcerning gender roles. The bans therefore must fail as\nimpermissible gender discrimination.\n\n    I do not mean, by presenting this alternative analysis, to\nminimize the fact that the same-sex marriage bans necessarily\nhave their greatest effect on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and\ntransgender individuals. Still, it bears noting that the social\nexclusion and state discrimination against lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, and transgender people reflects, in large part,\ndisapproval of their nonconformity with gender-based\nexpectations.12    That is, such individuals are often\ndiscriminated against because they are not acting or speaking\nor dressing as “real men” or “real women” supposedly do.\n“[S]tereotypes about homosexuality are directly related to our\nstereotypes about the proper roles of men and women.”\n\n\n     12\n       Although not evidently represented among the plaintiff class,\ntransgender people suffer from similar gender stereotyping expectations.\nSee, e.g., Schwenk v. Hartford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767821\"><a href=\"/opinion/767821/douglas-w-schwenk-v-james-hartford-steve-sinclair-robert-mitchellopinion/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201–02 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(discrimination on the basis of transgender status is also gender\ndiscrimination).\n\f                      LATTA V.

Mass. 2002);\nsee also Andrew Koppelman, Why Discrimination Against\nLesbians and Gay Men is Sex Discrimination, 69 N.Y.U. L.\nRev. 197 (1994). The same-sex marriage prohibitions, in\nother words, impose harms on sexual orientation and gender\nidentity minorities precisely because they impose and enforce\ngender-normative behavior.\n\n    I do recognize, however, that the gender classification\nrubric does not adequately capture the essence of many of the\nrestrictions targeted at lesbian, gay, and bisexual people.\nEmployment discrimination, housing discrimination, and\nperemptory strikes on the basis of sexual orientation, to name\na few of the exclusions gays, lesbians, and other sexual\norientation minorities have faced, are primarily motivated by\nstereotypes about sexual orientation; by animus against\npeople based on their nonconforming sexual orientation; and\nby distaste for same-sex sexual activity or the perceived\npersonal characteristics of individuals who engage in such\nbehavior. See, e.g., Romer v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996);\nSmithKline Beecham Corp. v.

And those sorts of restrictions do not turn directly on\ngender; they do not withhold a benefit, choice, or opportunity\nfrom an individual because that individual is a man or a\nwoman. Although the gender stereotyping so typical of sex\ndiscrimination may be present, see generally Koppelman, 69\nN.Y.U. L. Rev. 197, those restrictions are better analyzed as\nsexual orientation discrimination, as we did in SmithKline.\n740 F.3d at 480–84.\n\n    As to the same-sex marriage bans in particular, however,\nthe gender discrimination rubric does squarely apply, for the\nreasons I have discussed. And as I hope I have shown, the\nconcepts and standards developed in more than forty years of\n\f84                    LATTA V.

Widiss et al., Exposing Sex Stereotypes in Recent\nSame-Sex Marriage Jurisprudence, 30 Harv. J. L. & Gender\n461, 505 (2007). In my view, the same-sex marriage bans\nbelie that understanding, and, for that reason as well, cannot\nstand.\n\f</pre>",
