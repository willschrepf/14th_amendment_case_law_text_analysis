Smith, an inmate at the Pennsylvania State\nCorrectional Facility at Frackville (\"SCI-Frackville\") filed this\ncivil rights action under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 alleging that\ncertain corrections officers and prison employees denied\n\fhim due process of law and/or violated his Eighth\nAmendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment. The district court dismissed Smith’s due\nprocess claims against some of the defendants under FED.\nR. CIV. P. 12(b)(6), but Smith was allowed to proceed on his\nEighth Amendment claims. The court subsequently granted\nsummary judgment against Smith and in favor of the\ndefendants on all of Smith’s claims. For the reasons that\nfollow, we will reverse in part and affirm in part, and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Misconduct Reports\n\nSometime during the morning of June 3, 1995,\nCorrections Officer Robin Mensinger issued a misconduct\nreport citing Smith with refusing to obey an order to return\nto his cell after cell cleanup, and for using foul language\ntowards a corrections officer. Later that afternoon,\nMensinger cited Smith in a second misconduct report for\nallegedly punching her in the eye. That evening, Sergeant\nPaulukonis issued a third misconduct report against Smith.\nThat report cited Smith for assaulting corrections officers\n\n                                2\n\n\nas they were escorting him to the Restricted Housing Unit\n(\"RHU\").\n\nSmith denies that he assaulted Mensinger or struggled\nwith other corrections officers later that evening. He admits\nthat he did not return to his cell when Mensinger requested\nhim to, but claims that he only refused because his cell\nwas still wet. According to Smith, Mensinger was drunk\nand out of control when she issued the first misconduct\nreport. He claims that as he was leaving his cell during an\norganized prisoner movement later that day, he heard a\nwhistle blow and looked up to see Mensinger pointing at\nhim. A few seconds later, Corrections Officers Jones and\nYoder purportedly arrived on the cell block. Smith claims\nthat Mensinger told the corrections officers that Smith had\npunched her in the eye. Smith maintains that Yoder then\nhandcuffed him behind his back, and walked him to a\nbench where Smith was ordered to sit down. According to\nSmith, other corrections officers (including Androshick,\nZubris and McCole) entered the area a few minutes later.\nThe officers then purportedly grabbed Smith by both arms\nand followed Corrections Officer Novitsky to the Unit\nManager’s Office. There, Smith claims that Yurkiewicz and\nJones joined the group and Yoder left.\n\nOnce inside the Unit Manager’s Office, the officers\nallegedly rammed Smith’s head into walls and cabinets and\nknocked him to the floor. He claims that while he was on\nthe floor, Yurkiewicz kicked and punched him, and\nNovitsky \"pulled him to his feet, pushed him against the\nwall, punched him in the stomach, and choked him with\n\fboth hands. . . .\" Brief for Appellant at 15. Smith alleges\nthat Paulukonis saw the beating, but did nothing to\nintervene or restore order.\n\nSmith further alleges that after the beating in the Unit\nManager’s office, two or three guards took him to the RHU\nwhere Yurkiewicz placed him face-down on a bench,\ntightened the handcuffs as much as possible, and hit him\non the back of the head while verbally threatening him and\nshowering him with racial epithets.\n\nB. Smith’s Injuries\n\nSmith alleges that his head was bleeding and the beating\nalso resulted in pain in his ribs, ears, and right eye. His\n\n                                3\n\n\nribs were purportedly red and bruised and remained sore\nfor a couple of weeks after the beating. Smith was seen by\nthe medical staff each of the following two days, but\naccording to the medical records, he was treated only for\nchronic asthma. In his deposition, Smith stated that a\ndoctor gave him ice for his ribs and told him to keep a wet\ntowel against them the day after the incident. However, a\nreport prepared by the defendants’ medical expert states\nthat an examination of Smith soon after the incident failed\nto disclose any wounds, marks, or bruises near his rib cage\nor anywhere else.\n\nC. The Aftermath of the June 3, 1995 Incident\n\nOn June 4, 1995, Pennsylvania State Trooper Leo Luciani\ninterviewed Smith regarding Smith’s alleged attack of\nMensinger. During that interview Luciani purportedly\nshowed Smith a photograph of Mensinger that Smith\nclaims supports his claim that he never hit her in the face.\nNevertheless, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint\nagainst Smith based upon Mensinger’s allegation, and\nLuciani testified for the prosecution at the preliminary\nhearing on those charges. The charges included assault,\nassault by a prisoner, and retaliation for past official action.\nThe Commonwealth subsequently added the charge of\ndisorderly conduct, and Smith eventually pled nolo\ncontendere to that charge. The trial court then granted the\nCommonwealth’s request to nol pros the remaining charges.\n\nMeanwhile, a hearing on the three misconduct reports\nwas scheduled at SCI-Frackville, and Smith completed a\n\"Request for Representation\" form listing two inmates he\nwanted to call as witnesses at that hearing. He claims that\nthose two inmates would have testified that he did not\nstrike Mensinger as she had charged. When Smith arrived\nat the hearing, Hearing Officer Mary Canino informed him\nthat his witnesses were not available and that the hearing\nwould be delayed until that afternoon.1 However, the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Smith contends that his witnesses were not available because they\n\fwere waiting for their own hearings on misconduct notices which \"the\ndrunk and outer [sic] control\" Mensinger had also issued to them on\nJune 3, 1995. App. at 61.\n\n                                4\n\n\nhearing did not proceed that afternoon, and Smith was\ntransferred to the State Correctional Institution at Mahoney\n(\"SCI-Mahoney\") the next day.\n\nSmith’s misconduct hearing reconvened at SCI-Mahoney\na few days later. However, since Smith’s witnesses\nremained at SCI-Frackville, Canino offered to continue the\nhearing to afford Smith an opportunity to submit written\nstatements from his witnesses. Smith refused the offer\nbecause he did not trust that prison officials would obtain\naccurate statements. Rather than submit those statements,\nSmith sought a continuance in order to attempt to recover\nthe allegedly exculpatory photograph that Trooper Luciani\nhad shown him. Canino denied Smith’s request for a\ncontinuance, and Smith’s hearing on the misconduct\nreports proceeded without his witnesses.\n\nCanino credited the testimony against Smith, and found\nSmith guilty of the conduct charged in all three misconduct\nreports. He received seven months disciplinary confinement\nfor assaulting Mensinger and for resisting the officers who\nwere escorting him to the RHU. Canino also ordered that\nSmith’s prison account be assessed for \"medical and other\nexpenses\" to pay for contact lenses for Officer Mensinger\neven though no evidence of any such expenses had been\nproduced at the hearing. App. at 63. Accordingly, $165.00\nwas deducted from Smith’s inmate account. Smith\nchallenged that action by filing a grievance in which he\ncomplained that there was insufficient evidence to debit his\naccount to buy Mensinger lenses. He also unsuccessfully\nappealed to the Program Review Committee, and to\nSuperintendent Dragovich.\n\nII. Procedural History\n\nOn May 23, 1997, Smith filed the instant pro se civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 against Corrections\nOfficers Mensinger, Novitsky, and Paulukonis; as well as\nHearing Officer Canino, and Business Manager Burgard.\nThe defendants were each sued individually and in their\nofficial capacity. Smith later joined Corrections Officers\nYurkiewicz, Androshick, McCole, Zubris, and Jones as well\nas Superintendent Dragovich.\n\n                                5\n\n\nSmith claimed that several corrections officers used\nexcessive force during the June 3 incident, and that they\nthereafter falsified reports regarding that incident in order\nto cover up their use of excessive force. Smith also claimed\nthat Canino violated his due process rights by improperly\nassessing his inmate account, and that Burgard and\n\fDragovich did not adequately investigate his grievance on\nappeal.\n\nAlthough the district court granted Smith’s request to\namend his Complaint to join Dragovich as a defendant, the\ncourt later dismissed the claim against Dragovich as well as\nSmith’s claim against unknown defendant, \"John Doe.\"\nMensinger, Paulukonis, Canino, and Burgard thereafter\nmoved to dismiss Smith’s claims against them pursuant to\nFED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). The district court granted that\nmotion. In an unreported opinion, Smith v. Luciani, Nos.\nCIV.A. 97-3037, CIV.A. 97-3613, 1998 WL 151803 (E.D. Pa.\nMarch 31, 1998) (hereinafter \"Smith I\"), the district court\nexplained that since Smith did not have a liberty interest in\nremaining in the general prison population, he could not\nestablish a due process claim based upon being placed in\ndisciplinary custody. The court also dismissed Smith’s\nclaim against Mensinger based in part upon its belief that\nthe claim constituted an improper collateral attack on\nSmith’s disorderly conduct conviction.\n\nThe district court allowed Smith to proceed against the\nremaining corrections officers on his Eighth Amendment\nclaim, but later granted defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment, dismissing that claim, as well. In a second\nunreported opinion, Smith v. Mensinger, No. CIV.A. 97-\n3613, 1999 WL 178539 (E.D. Pa. March 31, 1999)\n(hereinafter \"Smith II\"), the court concluded that Smith\ncould not prevail under the Eighth Amendment because the\nminimal nature of his injuries established that any force\nthat may have been used against him must have been de\nminimis and therefore insufficient to constitute an Eighth\nAmendment violation. The court also concluded that\nwhatever force the corrections officers had used was\njustified by Smith’s assault of Mensinger, and the fact that\nhe struggled with the other corrections officers. The court\ndid note that Smith denied assaulting Mensinger and\n\n                                6\n\n\nstruggling with corrections officers. However, the court\nrefused to credit that denial because Smith offered nothing\nto support it, and the hearing officer had found him guilty\nof the charged misconduct. This appeal followed. 2\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nSmith argues the district court erred in dismissing both\nhis due process claim, and his Eighth Amendment claim. In\naddressing Smith’s challenge to the dismissal of his Eighth\nAmendment claim, we must first decide if he can prevail\ndespite the de minimis nature of his injuries. If we decide\nthat he can, we must then decide if a corrections officer\n(Paulukonis) can be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment \"merely\" because he failed to intervene in the\nbeating allegedly administered by his fellow corrections\nofficers.3\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\fIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must view\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty. See Brooks v. Kyler, 204 F.3d 102, 105 n.5 (3d Cir.\n2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only if \"there is\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The parties have since successfully mediated the claims arising from\nthe debit of Smith’s account. Accordingly, they are not before us.\n\n3. Smith alleges that he was beaten on June 3, 1995, and he filed suit\nMay 23, 1997. The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") became effective\non April 26, 1996, before Smith sued. The PLRA requires that inmates\nexhaust claims challenging prison conditions before filing suit under\nS 1983. See Ghana v. Holland, 226 F.3d 175, (3d Cir. 2000). Smith’s\nEighth Amendment claim is subject to that requirement. See Booth v.\nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 741 (2001). However, exhaustion is an\naffirmative defense which can be waived if not properly preserved by a\ndefendant. See Ray v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287 (3d. Cir. 2002). Defendants\nhere have not raised any issues relating to exhaustion. Accordingly, even\nassuming that any such issue exists here, it has clearly been waived and\nwe therefore need not address whether Smith has properly exhausted\nunder the PLRA.\n\n                                7\n\n\nA motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), on the\nother hand, should not be granted unless it appears that\nthe plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle\nhim/her to relief. See Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-6\n(1957). In undertaking that analysis, we must construe\ncomplaints of pro se litigants liberally. See Zilich v. Lucht,\n981 F.2d 694, 694 (3d Cir. 1992). The issue of an officer’s\nduty to intervene presents a question of law, which we\nreview de novo. See Holland v. New Jersey Dep’t of\nCorrections, 246 F.3d 267, 281 (3d Cir. 2001) (stating that\nquestions of law are reviewed de novo).\n\nWe will first address Smith’s Eighth Amendment claims\nand then examine his due process claim.\n\nB. The Eighth Amendment Claim Based Upon\nExcessive Force\n\nThe district court correctly noted that prison guards who\nmaliciously and sadistically use force against an inmate\nviolate \"contemporary standards of decency even if the\nresulting injuries are not significant.\" Smith II, 1999 WL\n178539, at *3 (internal quotations omitted). However, after\nnoting that Smith could establish an Eighth Amendment\nviolation even absent evidence of serious physical injuries,\nthe district court then focused exclusively on the severity of\nSmith’s injuries in denying his claim. The court stated:\n\n       Even assuming that plaintiff could show that\n       defendants acted with the requisite state of mind, the\n\f       Court concludes that the alleged wrongdoing by\n       defendants was not objectively harmful enough to\n       establish a constitutional violation. Initially, the Court\n       notes that the injuries suffered by plaintiff were\n       relatively minor.\n\n        . . . .\n\n        Additionally, accepting as true plaintiff ’s version of\n       the facts, including being handcuffed, punched, kicked,\n       and thrown into cabinets and walls, and given the\n       slight injuries suffered by plaintiff, the Court finds that\n       the incident between plaintiff and defendants involved\n       a de minimis use of force that was not repugnant to\n       the conscience of mankind.\n\n                                8\n\n\nId. at *4. Thus, although the court acknowledged that the\nabsence of severe injuries did not preclude Smith’s Eighth\nAmendment claim as a matter of law, the court concluded\nthat the evidentiary value of the absence of injuries was too\ncompelling to ignore. See id. Citing Smith’s alleged attack\non Mensinger, the court also noted that \"the record shows\nthat defendants reasonably perceived plaintiff to be a threat\nand the need for application of force was apparent.\" Id. at\n*5.\n\nWe begin our analysis of that ruling with the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Hudson v. McMillan, 503 U.S. 1 (1992).\nThere, an inmate sued prison guards under S 1983 alleging\nthat they had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment even though he had not suffered serious\ninjuries during the alleged assault. The Court therefore had\nto decide \"whether the use of excessive physical force\nagainst a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment when the inmate does not suffer serious\ninjury.\" Hudson, 503 U.S. at 4 (emphasis added). The Court\n\"answer[ed] that question in the affirmative.\" Id.\n\nWe applied the teachings of Hudson in Brooks v. Kyler,\n204 F.3d 102 (3d Cir. 2000). There, an inmate sued four\nprison guards under S 1983 alleging that they had beaten\nhim in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Although the\nundisputed medical evidence showed that the plaintiff\nsuffered only a few scratches on his neck and hands, he\ntestified that he was repeatedly punched in the head,\nstomped about the back and neck, slammed into a cell\nwall, choked, threatened, and nearly rendered unconscious.\nAll of this was allegedly done while he was handcuffed. See\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 104. In reviewing the claim, we noted\nthat it was \"apparent that the type of vicious, prolonged\nattack alleged by Brooks would have resulted in far greater\ninjuries than those which he indisputably sustained.\" Id. at\n105. Nonetheless, we reversed the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment, stating: \"[a]ccepting Brooks’s\nallegations as true, as we must, a jury could find that the\ndefendants acted not merely in good-faith to maintain or\n\frestore discipline, but rather out of malice for the very\npurpose of causing harm.\" Id. at 109.\n\n                                9\n\n\nThe district court dismissed Smith’s claims before we\ndecided Brooks. Accordingly, the court did not have the\nbenefit of that analysis when, in denying Smith’s claims\nhere, it focused almost exclusively on \"the lack of a serious\nphysical injury. . . .\" Smith II, 1999 WL 178539, at *4,\nquoting Eppers v. Dragovich, No. 95-7673, 1996 WL\n420830, at * 4 (E.D. Pa. July 24, 1996). It is now clear that\nthe district court erred in focusing so narrowly on the\nabsence of serious injuries in deciding if Smith could\nestablish a claim based upon excessive force. As we clearly\nstated in Brooks, the Eighth Amendment analysis must be\ndriven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in\nwhich it is applied; not by the resulting injuries.\n\n       Requiring objective or independent proof of minor or\n       significant injury, would ignore this teaching and place\n       protection from injury, instead of protection from\n       wanton force, at the hub of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 108, citing Moore v. Holbrook, 2 F.3d\n697, 700 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\nNevertheless, it is true that the Eighth Amendment does\nnot protect an inmate against an objectively de minimis use\nof force. See Hudson, 503 U.S. at 9-10. Rather, as noted\nabove, the pivotal inquiry in reviewing an inmate’sS 1983\nclaim for excessive force is \"whether force was applied in a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\" Brooks, 204\nF.3d at 106, citing Hudson, 503 U.S. at 7. However, injuries\nare only one of several factors that a court must consider\nin answering that question.\n\n       In determining whether a correctional officer has used\n       excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\n       courts look to several factors including: (1) the need for\n       the application of force; (2) the relationship between\n       the need and the amount of force that was used; (3)\n       the extent of the injury inflicted; (4) the extent of the\n       threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably\n       perceived by responsible officials on the basis of facts\n       known to them; and (5) any efforts made to temper the\n       severity of the forceful response.\n\n                                10\n\n\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 106, citing Hudson , 503 U.S. at 7.\nTherefore, de minimis injuries do not necessarily establish\nde minimis force.\n\n       If we were to adopt the District Court’s reasoning, a\n       prisoner could constitutionally be attacked for the sole\n       purpose of causing pain as long as the blows were\n\f       inflicted in a manner that resulted in visible (or\n       palpable or diagnosable) injuries that were de minimis.\n\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 108.\n\nWe do not, of course, suggest that a fact finder could not\nconsider the de minimis nature of injuries along with all of\nthe other circumstances in concluding that the force that\nwas employed could not have risen to the level required for\nan Eighth Amendment violation. A properly instructed fact\nfinder could, after considering all of the evidence, conclude\nthat Smith’s injuries were so minor that the defendants’\naccount of the incident is more credible than Smith’s,\nand/or that the force used was not of constitutional\ndimension. That may have been exactly what the district\ncourt did here. However, that is an issue of fact to be\nresolved by the fact finder based upon the totality of the\nevidence; it is not an issue of law a court can decide.4\n\nPunching and kicking someone who is handcuffed behind\nhis back and under the control of at least six prison guards\nas he is being thrown into cabinets and walls is\"repugnant\nto the conscience of mankind,\" absent the extraordinary\ncircumstances necessary to justify that kind of force.\nHudson, 503 U.S. at 10. Smith alleges he was the victim of\nan unprovoked and unjustified beating. The district court\ndismissed his Eighth Amendment claims, noting that\"the\nrecord shows that defendants reasonably perceived plaintiff\nto be a threat and the need for the application of force was\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In Brooks, we noted that when courts focus on the extent of the\ninjury, it is important to recognize that \"an inmate who is proceeding pro\nse, is in a decidedly difficult position from which to generate ‘record\nevidence’ on his behalf . . . [u]nder these circumstances, his affidavits\n. . . are about the best that can be expected from him [at summary\njudgment phase of] the proceedings.\" Brooks, 204 F.3d at 108 n.7\n(emphasis added), quoting Norman v. Taylor, 25 F.3d 1259, 1265 (4th\nCir. 1994) (Hall, J., dissenting).\n\n                                11\n\n\napparent.\" Smith II, 1999 WL 178539, at *5. The court\nreached that conclusion in part because it found that\nSmith had created a disturbance by \"allegedly punching\nC.O. Mensinger twice in the eye,\" as well as\"continually\nstruggling with the defendants . . . .\" Id . (emphasis added).\nHowever, Smith alleges that he was handcuffed behind his\nback during the \"disturbance,\" and he maintains he did not\nhit Mensinger or struggle with the guards as they punched\nand kicked him, and rammed his head into the wall. If we\naccept Smith’s version of the facts as true, as we must,\nthere was simply no justification for the defendants’\nconduct, and the district court’s ruling to the contrary can\nnot stand.5\n\nDefendants argue that we should nevertheless affirm the\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Officers Androshick,\nMcCole, Zubris, and Jones because Smith concedes that he\n\fis not sure that they participated in the beating at all.\nHowever, the fact that Smith has acknowledged that he\ncould not see those defendants during the beating neither\nnegates their involvement nor their liability as a matter of\nlaw. Smith testified: \"Officer Yurkiewicz, Zubris,\nAndroshick, McCole, Jones, all of them was in back of me\nand they were pushing my head, right, into the cabinets in\nthe wall, cabinets and walls. And then after that, I was\nknocked to the floor.\" App. at 166 (emphasis added). He\nfurther testified: \". . . the full force of all the guards [was]\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The district court was also concerned about the potential for an\nescalating confrontation with other inmates because\"other prisoners on\nthe cell block were not locked in their cells and were being let out into\nthe yard.\" Smith II, 1999 WL 178539, at *5. However, Smith alleges that\nthe beating occurred out of sight of the other inmates. Moreover, even if\nothers could see what was occurring, the reasonableness of the force\nused would still be an issue of fact for a jury, not an issue of law for the\ncourt. As we noted in Brooks, \"while . . . application of some force may\nhave been needed\" to maintain order, \"[the plaintiff] was shackled at the\ntime [of the beating] so that the extent of his threat to staff would not\nhave been great.\" Brooks, 204 F.3d at 106.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming that other inmates could see Smith, it is\ndifficult to understand how beating a handcuffed inmate in the presence\nof other inmates in the manner Smith alleges could reasonably be\ncalculated to reduce tension and restore order inside a prison.\n\n                                12\n\n\nbehind me, they rammed my head into the cabinet and into\nthe wall . . . No, I didn’t say he [Yurkiewicz] did. I said all\nof them.\" Id. at 168 (emphasis added). That testimony is\nsufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to\neach of those defendants. See Brooks, 204 F.3d at 109.\n\nMoreover, it is undisputed that all of the named officers\nwere in the vicinity at some point when Smith alleges he\nwas beaten. The extent of each officer’s participation is thus\na classic factual dispute to be resolved by the fact finder.\nAccordingly, we will vacate the judgment in favor of\ndefendants Novitsky, Yurkiewicz, Androshick, McCole,\nZubris, and Jones and remand the matter for further\nproceedings.\n\nC. Officer Paulukonis’ Duty to Intervene\n\nAs noted earlier, Smith does not allege that Paulukonis\ntook part in the beating. Rather, Smith claims that\nPaulukonis can be liable under the Eighth Amendment if he\nfailed to intervene. We agree. We hold that a corrections\nofficer’s failure to intervene in a beating can be the basis of\nliability for an Eighth Amendment violation underS 1983 if\nthe corrections officer had a reasonable opportunity to\nintervene and simply refused to do so. Furthermore, we\nhold that a corrections officer can not escape liability by\nrelying upon his inferior or non-supervisory rank vis-a-vis\nthe other officers.\n\fCourts have held that a police officer has a duty to take\nreasonable steps to protect a victim from another officer’s\nuse of excessive force, even if the excessive force is\nemployed by a superior. \"If a police officer, whether\nsupervisory or not, fails or refuses to intervene when a\nconstitutional violation such as an unprovoked beating\ntakes place in his presence, the officer is directly liable\nunder Section 1983.\" Byrd v. Clark, 783 F.2d 1002, 1007\n(11th Cir. 1986); accord Putman v. Gerloff, 639 F.2d 415,\n423 (8th Cir. 1981); Byrd v. Brishke, 466 F.2d 6, 11 (7th\nCir. 1972). However, an officer is only liable if there is a\nrealistic and reasonable opportunity to intervene. See Clark,\n783 F.2d at 1007 (instructing the district court upon\nremand to determine whether the officer was in a position\n\n                                13\n\n\nto intervene); Brishke, 466 F.2d at 11 (liability for failure to\nintervene exists only if the beating occurred in the officer’s\npresence or was otherwise within his knowledge); Putman,\n639 F.2d at 423-24 (liability exists only if the non-\nintervening officer saw the beating or had time to reach the\noffending officer).\n\nIn Baker v. Monroe Township, 50 F.3d 1186 (3d. Cir.\n1995), we held that a police officer who was the senior\nofficer involved in executing a search warrant could be\nliable in a suit under S 1983 even though he did not\npersonally use excessive force, nor direct anyone else to. We\nconcluded that \"there [was] sufficient evidence to permit an\ninference that [the officer] knew of and acquiesced in the\ntreatment the [plaintiffs] were receiving at the hands of the\nother officers acting under his supervision.\" Baker, 50 F.3d\nat 1193. The specific circumstances in Baker required us to\ndetermine if the plaintiff had shown that the senior officer\nhad \"actual knowledge and acquiescence.\" Id. at 1194,\nquoting Rode v. Dellarciprete, 845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.\n1988). Although the specific context of our analysis only\ninvolved an officer’s liability for the actions of police officers\nunder his supervision, we do not interpret Baker as\nsuggesting that liability for failure to intervene is solely\nlimited to supervisors or officers who outrank their\noffending colleagues.\n\nThe duty to uphold the law does not turn upon an\nofficer’s rank. It is neither affected by, nor proportional to,\na non-intervening officer’s relationship to an offending\ncolleague. The approving silence emanating from the officer\nwho stands by and watches as others unleash an\nunjustified assault contributes to the actual use of\nexcessive force, and we cannot ignore the tacit support\nsuch silence lends to those who are actually striking the\nblows. Such silence is an endorsement of the constitutional\nviolation resulting from the illegal use of force. 6 It is\nincompatible with the restrictions imposed under the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The message that emanates from such silence was vocalized in\n\fHudson where the supervisor allegedly stood by and told officers who\nwere beating an inmate \"not to have too much fun.\" Hudson, 503 U.S.\nat 4.\n\n                                14\n\n\nEighth Amendment, and is therefore unacceptable. We will\nnot immunize such conduct by suggesting that an officer\ncan silently contribute to such a constitutional violation\nand escape responsibility for it. The restriction on cruel and\nunusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment\nreaches non-intervention just as readily as it reaches the\nmore demonstrable brutality of those who unjustifiably and\nexcessively employ fists, boots or clubs.\n\nAlthough our case law refers to police officers, not\ncorrections officers, this does not change our analysis.7\nBoth are law enforcement officers, both are sworn to uphold\nthe law, and both are authorized to use force (even deadly\nforce) toward that end. We are, of course, aware of the\nobvious security concerns inside the close confines of a\nprison. However, that is simply one factor that must be\nconsidered in determining if a particular application of force\nis reasonable. It does not suggest a different Eighth\nAmendment inquiry for corrections officers as opposed to\npolice officers. The law does not allow either to condone or\ncover up the use of excessive force. Similarly, neither can\nescape liability by turning either a blind eye or deaf ear to\nthe illegal conduct of their colleagues.\n\nTherefore, \"if [Smith] can show at trial that an officer\nattacked him while [Paulukonis] ignored a realistic\nopportunity to intervene, he can recover.\" Miller v. Smith,\n220 F.3d 491, 495 (7th Cir. 2000). Moreover, neither rank\nnor supervisory status is a factor in assessing whether\nPaulukonis had \"a realistic opportunity to intervene.\" Id.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We have, however, held that a corrections officer’s acquiescence can\nresult in liability under S 1983 in a very different context than we are\nconfronted with here. See Curtis v. Everette, 489 F.2d 516 (3rd Cir.\n1973).\n\n8. Although it is clear that Paulokonis’ junior rank and lack of\nsupervisory status does not immunize him from liability for failing to\nintervene, we do not suggest that a fact finder could not conclude that\nthe conduct of a supervisor who fails to intervene is even more\nreprehensible and blameworthy than that of a more junior officer. The\nfact that rank does not shield one from liability does not mean that a\nfact finder must ignore the even greater dereliction of duty that occurs\nwhen a supervisor tolerates the kind of misconduct that is alleged here.\n\n                                15\n\n\nThere is some evidence that Paulukonis witnessed the\nbeating that his fellow officers allegedly administered to\nSmith. Smith alleges that Paulukonis stated in his\nmisconduct report that \"[t]he minimum amount of force\n\fwas used to place inmate Smith onto the floor.\" App. at\n329. This appears to be based upon first-hand observations\nPaulukonis made while standing at the door of the Unit\nManager’s office during the incident. Smith further testified\nthat the door of the office remained open throughout the\nincident and that Paulukonis saw the beating. A fact finder\ncould conclude that Paulukonis knew that his fellow\nofficers were using excessive force against Smith, had an\nopportunity to intervene, but refused to do so. Accordingly,\nthe district court erred in dismissing Smith’s Eighth\nAmendment claim against Paulukonis.\n\nD. Smith’s Due Process Claim\n\nIn a separate opinion, the district court also held that\nSmith could not establish a due process claim under Griffin\nv. Vaughn, 112 F.3d 703 (3d Cir. 1997). See Smith I, 1998\nWL 151803, at *5. The district court reasoned that Smith\n\"was subjected to seven months disciplinary time, a period\nof time half of that implicated in Griffin.\" Id. The court\nreasoned that, even assuming that the misconduct reports\nwere issued to cover up the use of excessive force, the\ndisciplinary sanction still did not constitute a due process\nviolation as it did not rise to the level of an\"atypical and\nsignificant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.\" Id., quoting Griffin , 112 F.3d at 706.\n\nSmith argues that the district court misinterpreted the\nbasis of his due process claim. Smith does not claim that\nthe seven months disciplinary sanction was a violation of a\nliberty interest and therefore a denial of due process.\nRather, Smith claims that Mensinger issued a misconduct\nreport to retaliate against Smith for his conduct toward\nMensinger and to cover up a beating. Thus, Smith claims\nthat the misconduct report was not intended to enforce\nprison regulations at all, and it was therefore improper to\nimpose a disciplinary sanction.9 However, even assuming\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. As noted earlier, we will interpret Smith’s pro se complaint liberally.\nSee Zilich, 981 F.2d at 694.\n\n                                16\n\n\nthat the district court did misconstrue the crux of Smith’s\ndue process claim, it is nevertheless evident that the court’s\nrejection of that claim was correct.\n\nIn Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995), an inmate had\nbeen charged with multiple disciplinary infractions, but the\ninmate’s request to produce certain witnesses at his\nhearing was refused by the hearing committee because the\nwitnesses were unavailable. The committee found the\ninmate guilty of the charged misconduct and sentenced him\nto 30 days in segregated confinement. Thereafter, he\nbrought a S 1983 suit claiming that the hearing did not\nsatisfy the requirements of due process. See Sandin, 515\nU.S. at 475-76. The Court disagreed. The Court held that\nconfinement in administrative or punitive segregation will\n\frarely be sufficient, without more, to establish the kind of\n\"atypical\" deprivation of prison life necessary to implicate a\nliberty interest. Therefore, the Court found that the\ninmate’s segregated confinement was not a denial of due\nprocess. See id. at 486.\n\nPrison disciplinary proceedings may, however, constitute\na denial of due process in the context of a civil rights action\nunder S 1983 when they are instituted for the sole purpose\nof retaliating against an inmate for his/her exercise of a\nconstitutional right. In Allah v. Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220 (3d\nCir. 2000), we stated:\n\n       Sandin instructs that placement in administrative\n       confinement will generally not create a liberty interest.\n       Retaliation may be actionable, however, even when the\n       retaliatory action does not involve a liberty interest.\n       [G]overnment actions, which standing alone do not\n       violate the Constitution, may nonetheless be\n       constitutional torts if motivated in substantial part by\n       a desire to punish an individual for exercise of a\n       constitutional right.\n\nSeiverling, 229 F.3d at 224 (internal citations and quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nWe have previously held that falsifying misconduct\nreports in retaliation for an inmate’s resort to legal process\nis a violation of the First Amendment guarantee of access to\nthe courts. See Millhouse v. Carlson, 652 F.2d 371, 374 (3d\n\n                                17\n\n\nCir. 1981). In Millhouse, the inmate alleged that prison\nofficials retaliated against him by fabricating misconduct\ncharges in response to his civil rights suit against the\nprison officials. We concluded that \"[s]uch allegations, if\nproven at trial, would establish an infringement of\nMillhouse’s first amendment right of access to the courts.\"\nMillhouse, 652 F.2d at 374.\n\nAlthough Millhouse also involved an allegation that prison\nofficials fabricated misconduct charges, that case is\ndistinguishable from Smith’s because the conduct in\nMillhouse implicated a constitutional right--the First\nAmendment right to access to the courts. Smith’s purported\nliberty deprivation, on the other hand, implicates no\nconstitutional right and therefore can not overcome the\nhurdle erected by the holding in Sandin. See Sandin, 515\nU.S. at 486. Under Sandin, an administrative sentence of\ndisciplinary confinement, by itself, is not sufficient to create\na liberty interest, and Smith does not claim that another\nconstitutional right (such as access to the courts) was\nviolated. Accordingly, we hold that the district court\ncorrectly dismissed Smith’s due process claim.\n\nIn dismissing the claims, the district court correctly\nrelied upon the analysis of the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit in Freeman v. Rideout, 808 F. 2d 949 (2d\n\fCir. 1986). In Freeman, an inmate brought a due process\nclaim against prison authorities under S 1983 alleging that\nthe prison officials’ use of falsified evidence and bogus\nmisconduct reports resulted in his being unconstitutionally\nconfined in punitive segregation for 30 days. See Freeman,\n808 F.2d at 951. The plaintiff was awarded damages\nfollowing a trial, but the award was reversed on appeal. The\ncourt of appeals concluded that, with respect to the\nmisconduct hearing, due process is satisfied where an\ninmate is afforded an opportunity to be heard and to defend\nagainst the allegedly falsified evidence and groundless\nmisconduct reports. Thus, so long as certain procedural\nrequirements are satisfied, mere allegations of falsified\nevidence or misconduct reports, without more, are not\nenough to state a due process claim. See id. at 953.\n\nSmith argues that \"there is more\" to his claim However,\nhe must clear two hurdles to overcome the district court’s\n\n                                18\n\n\nreliance on Freeman. First, it is now clear that the sanction\nSmith challenges (seven months disciplinary confinement)\ndoes not, on its own, violate a protected liberty interest as\ndefined in Sandin. Therefore, he can not establish that the\ndefendants’ conduct denied him substantive due process by\ninfringing upon a liberty interest. Second, he was afforded\na hearing and therefore had the opportunity to confront\nand challenge the allegedly perjured testimony offered in\nsupport of the misconduct reports. Under Freeman , that is\nall he was entitled to.\n\nSmith cites several cases in arguing that the district\ncourt erred in relying upon Freeman. However, the cases he\ncites are either distinguishable, or were decided before\nSandin, and are therefore of little precedential value.10 We\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The cases Smith cites in support of his argument are distinguishable\nin that they allege the deprivation of a constitutional right or liberty\ninterest apart from, or in conjunction with, the inmate’s segregation from\nthe greater prison population. See, e.g., Seiverling, 229 F.3d at 225\n(administrative segregation in retaliation for filing law suits violated\ninmate’s access to the courts); Millhouse, 652 F.2d at 374 (same); Grillo\nv. Coughlin, 31 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 1994) (the hearing itself did not comport\nwith due process because the fact finder was given falsified documents\nthat differed from the copies the inmate received); Franco v. Kelly, 854\nF.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1988) (inmate alleged that misconduct reports were\nfabricated in retaliation for his cooperation with an investigation by the\nstate’s Inspector General, thus implicating his right to petition the\ngovernment for redress of grievances); Cale v. Johnson, 861 F.2d 943\n(6th Cir. 1988) (allegations that prison officials fabricated misconduct\ncharge in retaliation for inmate’s complaint about food was actionable as\na Bivens suit); Sprouse v. Babcock, 870 F.2d 450 (8th Cir. 1989) (false\nmisconduct charges constituted retaliation for filing lawsuits and\ntherefore stated a claim under S 1983 because it implicated access to the\ncourts); Harbury v. Deutch, 233 F.3d 596 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (allegations of\nfalse statements designed to forestall a Bivens action stated a claim for\ndenial of access to the courts).\n\fRhodes v. Robinson, 612 F.2d 766 (3d Cir. 1979) and Black v. Lane, 22\nF.3d 1395 (7th Cir. 1994) are the only two cases cited by Smith that\nappear to support Smith’s claims. However, both Rhodes and Black were\ndecided before Sandin.\n\nAlthough Smith alleges that he was cited in the misconduct reports to\ncover up the defendants’ own improper conduct, his complaint does not\n\n                                19\n\n\nsuggest a retaliatory motive that would implicate a constitutional right\nsuch as access to the courts. Accordingly, accepting Smith’s allegations\nas true, he claims only that defendants’ conduct was improper and in\nbad faith, not that it denied him the due process that must form the\nbasis of his S 1983 claims.\n\n11. In affirming the dismissal of the due process claims we do not\nsuggest that we agree with the district court’s conclusion that Smith is\nimproperly attempting to collaterally attack his state court conviction for\ndisorderly conduct. He pled nolo contendere to that charge, and that plea\ndoes not bar his due process claims here. See Thomas v. Roach, 165\nF.3d 137, 144-45 (2d Cir. 1999); see also FED. R. EVID. 410.\ntherefore find that the district court did not err in\ndismissing Smith’s due process claims.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nAccordingly, we will affirm the district court’s dismissal of\nSmith’s due process claims.11 However, we hold that the\ndistrict court erred in dismissing Smith’s claims under the\nEighth Amendment. Consequently, we vacate the entry of\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants Novitsky,\nYurkiewicz, Androshick, McCole, Zubris, and Jones. We\nalso hold that corrections officers have a duty to intervene\nwhen other officers use excessive force irrespective of the\nrank of the offending officers. Accordingly, we will also\nreverse the dismissal of Smith’s Eighth Amendment claim\nagainst Paulukonis.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                20\n\f",

Smith, an inmate at the Pennsylvania State\nCorrectional Facility at Frackville (\"SCI-Frackville\") filed this\ncivil rights action under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 alleging that\ncertain corrections officers and prison employees denied\n\fhim due process of law and/or violated his Eighth\nAmendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment. The district court dismissed Smith’s due\nprocess claims against some of the defendants under FED.\nR. CIV. P. 12(b)(6), but Smith was allowed to proceed on his\nEighth Amendment claims. The court subsequently granted\nsummary judgment against Smith and in favor of the\ndefendants on all of Smith’s claims. For the reasons that\nfollow, we will reverse in part and affirm in part, and\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\nI. Background\n\nA. The Misconduct Reports\n\nSometime during the morning of June 3, 1995,\nCorrections Officer Robin Mensinger issued a misconduct\nreport citing Smith with refusing to obey an order to return\nto his cell after cell cleanup, and for using foul language\ntowards a corrections officer. Later that afternoon,\nMensinger cited Smith in a second misconduct report for\nallegedly punching her in the eye. That evening, Sergeant\nPaulukonis issued a third misconduct report against Smith.\nThat report cited Smith for assaulting corrections officers\n\n                                2\n\n\nas they were escorting him to the Restricted Housing Unit\n(\"RHU\").\n\nSmith denies that he assaulted Mensinger or struggled\nwith other corrections officers later that evening. He admits\nthat he did not return to his cell when Mensinger requested\nhim to, but claims that he only refused because his cell\nwas still wet. According to Smith, Mensinger was drunk\nand out of control when she issued the first misconduct\nreport. He claims that as he was leaving his cell during an\norganized prisoner movement later that day, he heard a\nwhistle blow and looked up to see Mensinger pointing at\nhim. A few seconds later, Corrections Officers Jones and\nYoder purportedly arrived on the cell block. Smith claims\nthat Mensinger told the corrections officers that Smith had\npunched her in the eye. Smith maintains that Yoder then\nhandcuffed him behind his back, and walked him to a\nbench where Smith was ordered to sit down. According to\nSmith, other corrections officers (including Androshick,\nZubris and McCole) entered the area a few minutes later.\nThe officers then purportedly grabbed Smith by both arms\nand followed Corrections Officer Novitsky to the Unit\nManager’s Office. There, Smith claims that Yurkiewicz and\nJones joined the group and Yoder left.\n\nOnce inside the Unit Manager’s Office, the officers\nallegedly rammed Smith’s head into walls and cabinets and\nknocked him to the floor. He claims that while he was on\nthe floor, Yurkiewicz kicked and punched him, and\nNovitsky \"pulled him to his feet, pushed him against the\nwall, punched him in the stomach, and choked him with\n\fboth hands. . . .\" Brief for Appellant at 15. Smith alleges\nthat Paulukonis saw the beating, but did nothing to\nintervene or restore order.\n\nSmith further alleges that after the beating in the Unit\nManager’s office, two or three guards took him to the RHU\nwhere Yurkiewicz placed him face-down on a bench,\ntightened the handcuffs as much as possible, and hit him\non the back of the head while verbally threatening him and\nshowering him with racial epithets.\n\nB. Smith’s Injuries\n\nSmith alleges that his head was bleeding and the beating\nalso resulted in pain in his ribs, ears, and right eye. His\n\n                                3\n\n\nribs were purportedly red and bruised and remained sore\nfor a couple of weeks after the beating. Smith was seen by\nthe medical staff each of the following two days, but\naccording to the medical records, he was treated only for\nchronic asthma. In his deposition, Smith stated that a\ndoctor gave him ice for his ribs and told him to keep a wet\ntowel against them the day after the incident. However, a\nreport prepared by the defendants’ medical expert states\nthat an examination of Smith soon after the incident failed\nto disclose any wounds, marks, or bruises near his rib cage\nor anywhere else.\n\nC. The Aftermath of the June 3, 1995 Incident\n\nOn June 4, 1995, Pennsylvania State Trooper Leo Luciani\ninterviewed Smith regarding Smith’s alleged attack of\nMensinger. During that interview Luciani purportedly\nshowed Smith a photograph of Mensinger that Smith\nclaims supports his claim that he never hit her in the face.\nNevertheless, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint\nagainst Smith based upon Mensinger’s allegation, and\nLuciani testified for the prosecution at the preliminary\nhearing on those charges. The charges included assault,\nassault by a prisoner, and retaliation for past official action.\nThe Commonwealth subsequently added the charge of\ndisorderly conduct, and Smith eventually pled nolo\ncontendere to that charge. The trial court then granted the\nCommonwealth’s request to nol pros the remaining charges.\n\nMeanwhile, a hearing on the three misconduct reports\nwas scheduled at SCI-Frackville, and Smith completed a\n\"Request for Representation\" form listing two inmates he\nwanted to call as witnesses at that hearing. He claims that\nthose two inmates would have testified that he did not\nstrike Mensinger as she had charged. When Smith arrived\nat the hearing, Hearing Officer Mary Canino informed him\nthat his witnesses were not available and that the hearing\nwould be delayed until that afternoon.1 However, the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. Smith contends that his witnesses were not available because they\n\fwere waiting for their own hearings on misconduct notices which \"the\ndrunk and outer [sic] control\" Mensinger had also issued to them on\nJune 3, 1995. App. at 61.\n\n                                4\n\n\nhearing did not proceed that afternoon, and Smith was\ntransferred to the State Correctional Institution at Mahoney\n(\"SCI-Mahoney\") the next day.\n\nSmith’s misconduct hearing reconvened at SCI-Mahoney\na few days later. However, since Smith’s witnesses\nremained at SCI-Frackville, Canino offered to continue the\nhearing to afford Smith an opportunity to submit written\nstatements from his witnesses. Smith refused the offer\nbecause he did not trust that prison officials would obtain\naccurate statements. Rather than submit those statements,\nSmith sought a continuance in order to attempt to recover\nthe allegedly exculpatory photograph that Trooper Luciani\nhad shown him. Canino denied Smith’s request for a\ncontinuance, and Smith’s hearing on the misconduct\nreports proceeded without his witnesses.\n\nCanino credited the testimony against Smith, and found\nSmith guilty of the conduct charged in all three misconduct\nreports. He received seven months disciplinary confinement\nfor assaulting Mensinger and for resisting the officers who\nwere escorting him to the RHU. Canino also ordered that\nSmith’s prison account be assessed for \"medical and other\nexpenses\" to pay for contact lenses for Officer Mensinger\neven though no evidence of any such expenses had been\nproduced at the hearing. App. at 63. Accordingly, $165.00\nwas deducted from Smith’s inmate account. Smith\nchallenged that action by filing a grievance in which he\ncomplained that there was insufficient evidence to debit his\naccount to buy Mensinger lenses. He also unsuccessfully\nappealed to the Program Review Committee, and to\nSuperintendent Dragovich.\n\nII. Procedural History\n\nOn May 23, 1997, Smith filed the instant pro se civil\nrights action under 42 U.S.C. S 1983 against Corrections\nOfficers Mensinger, Novitsky, and Paulukonis; as well as\nHearing Officer Canino, and Business Manager Burgard.\nThe defendants were each sued individually and in their\nofficial capacity. Smith later joined Corrections Officers\nYurkiewicz, Androshick, McCole, Zubris, and Jones as well\nas Superintendent Dragovich.\n\n                                5\n\n\nSmith claimed that several corrections officers used\nexcessive force during the June 3 incident, and that they\nthereafter falsified reports regarding that incident in order\nto cover up their use of excessive force. Smith also claimed\nthat Canino violated his due process rights by improperly\nassessing his inmate account, and that Burgard and\n\fDragovich did not adequately investigate his grievance on\nappeal.\n\nAlthough the district court granted Smith’s request to\namend his Complaint to join Dragovich as a defendant, the\ncourt later dismissed the claim against Dragovich as well as\nSmith’s claim against unknown defendant, \"John Doe.\"\nMensinger, Paulukonis, Canino, and Burgard thereafter\nmoved to dismiss Smith’s claims against them pursuant to\nFED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). The district court granted that\nmotion. In an unreported opinion, Smith v. Luciani, Nos.\nCIV.A. 97-3037, CIV.A. 97-3613, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">151803</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Pa.\nMarch 31, 1998) (hereinafter \"Smith I\"), the district court\nexplained that since Smith did not have a liberty interest in\nremaining in the general prison population, he could not\nestablish a due process claim based upon being placed in\ndisciplinary custody. The court also dismissed Smith’s\nclaim against Mensinger based in part upon its belief that\nthe claim constituted an improper collateral attack on\nSmith’s disorderly conduct conviction.\n\nThe district court allowed Smith to proceed against the\nremaining corrections officers on his Eighth Amendment\nclaim, but later granted defendants’ motion for summary\njudgment, dismissing that claim, as well. In a second\nunreported opinion, Smith v. Mensinger, No. CIV.A. 97-\n3613, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">178539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Pa. March 31, 1999)\n(hereinafter \"Smith II\"), the court concluded that Smith\ncould not prevail under the Eighth Amendment because the\nminimal nature of his injuries established that any force\nthat may have been used against him must have been de\nminimis and therefore insufficient to constitute an Eighth\nAmendment violation. The court also concluded that\nwhatever force the corrections officers had used was\njustified by Smith’s assault of Mensinger, and the fact that\nhe struggled with the other corrections officers. The court\ndid note that Smith denied assaulting Mensinger and\n\n                                6\n\n\nstruggling with corrections officers. However, the court\nrefused to credit that denial because Smith offered nothing\nto support it, and the hearing officer had found him guilty\nof the charged misconduct. This appeal followed. 2\n\nIII. Discussion\n\nSmith argues the district court erred in dismissing both\nhis due process claim, and his Eighth Amendment claim. In\naddressing Smith’s challenge to the dismissal of his Eighth\nAmendment claim, we must first decide if he can prevail\ndespite the de minimis nature of his injuries. If we decide\nthat he can, we must then decide if a corrections officer\n(Paulukonis) can be found liable under the Eighth\nAmendment \"merely\" because he failed to intervene in the\nbeating allegedly administered by his fellow corrections\nofficers.3\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\fIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must view\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving\nparty. See Brooks v. Kyler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767705\"><a href=\"/opinion/767705/alan-t-brooks-v-kyler-superintendent-porterfield-sgt-rupinski-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 n.5 (3d Cir.\n2000). Summary judgment is appropriate only if \"there is\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the\nmoving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The parties have since successfully mediated the claims arising from\nthe debit of Smith’s account. Accordingly, they are not before us.\n\n3. Smith alleges that he was beaten on June 3, 1995, and he filed suit\nMay 23, 1997. The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\") became effective\non April 26, 1996, before Smith sued. The PLRA requires that inmates\nexhaust claims challenging prison conditions before filing suit under\nS 1983. See Ghana v. Holland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770369\"><a href=\"/opinion/770369/dr-emory-m-ghana-v-j-t-holland/\"><span class=\"volume\">226</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (3d Cir. 2000). Smith’s\nEighth Amendment claim is subject to that requirement. See Booth v.\nChurner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118434\"><a href=\"/opinion/118434/booth-v-churner/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (2001). However, exhaustion is an\naffirmative defense which can be waived if not properly preserved by a\ndefendant. See Ray v. Kertes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777097\"><a href=\"/opinion/777097/frederick-t-ray-v-co-kertes-co-stolz-co-reed-co-rogers-lt-nash/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d. Cir. 2002). Defendants\nhere have not raised any issues relating to exhaustion. Accordingly, even\nassuming that any such issue exists here, it has clearly been waived and\nwe therefore need not address whether Smith has properly exhausted\nunder the PLRA.\n\n                                7\n\n\nA motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), on the\nother hand, should not be granted unless it appears that\nthe plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle\nhim/her to relief. See Conley v. Gibson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105573\"><a href=\"/opinion/105573/conley-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45-6\n(1957). In undertaking that analysis, we must construe\ncomplaints of pro se litigants liberally. See Zilich v. Lucht,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596502\"><a href=\"/opinion/596502/wayne-m-zilich-v-gary-lucht-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (3d Cir. 1992). The issue of an officer’s\nduty to intervene presents a question of law, which we\nreview de novo. See Holland v. New Jersey Dep’t of\nCorrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772805\"><a href=\"/opinion/772805/walter-holland-oveston-cox-terry-jacobs-brian-taylor-walter-williams-mildeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (3d Cir. 2001) (stating that\nquestions of law are reviewed de novo).\n\nWe will first address Smith’s Eighth Amendment claims\nand then examine his due process claim.\n\nB. The Eighth Amendment Claim Based Upon\nExcessive Force\n\nThe district court correctly noted that prison guards who\nmaliciously and sadistically use force against an inmate\nviolate \"contemporary standards of decency even if the\nresulting injuries are not significant.\" Smith II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">178539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (internal quotations omitted). However, after\nnoting that Smith could establish an Eighth Amendment\nviolation even absent evidence of serious physical injuries,\nthe district court then focused exclusively on the severity of\nSmith’s injuries in denying his claim. The court stated:\n\n       Even assuming that plaintiff could show that\n       defendants acted with the requisite state of mind, the\n\f       Court concludes that the alleged wrongdoing by\n       defendants was not objectively harmful enough to\n       establish a constitutional violation. Initially, the Court\n       notes that the injuries suffered by plaintiff were\n       relatively minor.\n\n        . . . .\n\n        Additionally, accepting as true plaintiff ’s version of\n       the facts, including being handcuffed, punched, kicked,\n       and thrown into cabinets and walls, and given the\n       slight injuries suffered by plaintiff, the Court finds that\n       the incident between plaintiff and defendants involved\n       a de minimis use of force that was not repugnant to\n       the conscience of mankind.\n\n                                8\n\n\nId. at *4. Thus, although the court acknowledged that the\nabsence of severe injuries did not preclude Smith’s Eighth\nAmendment claim as a matter of law, the court concluded\nthat the evidentiary value of the absence of injuries was too\ncompelling to ignore. See id. Citing Smith’s alleged attack\non Mensinger, the court also noted that \"the record shows\nthat defendants reasonably perceived plaintiff to be a threat\nand the need for application of force was apparent.\" Id. at\n*5.\n\nWe begin our analysis of that ruling with the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Hudson v. McMillan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112693\"><a href=\"/opinion/112693/hudson-v-mcmillian/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992).\nThere, an inmate sued prison guards under S 1983 alleging\nthat they had used excessive force in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment even though he had not suffered serious\ninjuries during the alleged assault. The Court therefore had\nto decide \"whether the use of excessive physical force\nagainst a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment when the inmate does not suffer serious\ninjury.\" Hudson, 503 U.S. at 4 (emphasis added). The Court\n\"answer[ed] that question in the affirmative.\" Id.\n\nWe applied the teachings of Hudson in Brooks v. Kyler,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767705\"><a href=\"/opinion/767705/alan-t-brooks-v-kyler-superintendent-porterfield-sgt-rupinski-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2000). There, an inmate sued four\nprison guards under S 1983 alleging that they had beaten\nhim in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Although the\nundisputed medical evidence showed that the plaintiff\nsuffered only a few scratches on his neck and hands, he\ntestified that he was repeatedly punched in the head,\nstomped about the back and neck, slammed into a cell\nwall, choked, threatened, and nearly rendered unconscious.\nAll of this was allegedly done while he was handcuffed. See\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 104. In reviewing the claim, we noted\nthat it was \"apparent that the type of vicious, prolonged\nattack alleged by Brooks would have resulted in far greater\ninjuries than those which he indisputably sustained.\" Id. at\n105. Nonetheless, we reversed the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment, stating: \"[a]ccepting Brooks’s\nallegations as true, as we must, a jury could find that the\ndefendants acted not merely in good-faith to maintain or\n\frestore discipline, but rather out of malice for the very\npurpose of causing harm.\" Id. at 109.\n\n                                9\n\n\nThe district court dismissed Smith’s claims before we\ndecided Brooks. Accordingly, the court did not have the\nbenefit of that analysis when, in denying Smith’s claims\nhere, it focused almost exclusively on \"the lack of a serious\nphysical injury. . . .\" Smith II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">178539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4,\nquoting Eppers v. Dragovich, No. 95-7673, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">420830</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at * 4 (E.D. Pa. July 24, 1996). It is now clear that\nthe district court erred in focusing so narrowly on the\nabsence of serious injuries in deciding if Smith could\nestablish a claim based upon excessive force. As we clearly\nstated in Brooks, the Eighth Amendment analysis must be\ndriven by the extent of the force and the circumstances in\nwhich it is applied; not by the resulting injuries.\n\n       Requiring objective or independent proof of minor or\n       significant injury, would ignore this teaching and place\n       protection from injury, instead of protection from\n       wanton force, at the hub of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 108, citing Moore v. Holbrook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628275\"><a href=\"/opinion/628275/william-c-moore-v-troy-e-holbrook-r-ginn-sgt-john-burton-sgt/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 700 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\nNevertheless, it is true that the Eighth Amendment does\nnot protect an inmate against an objectively de minimis use\nof force. See Hudson, 503 U.S. at 9-10. Rather, as noted\nabove, the pivotal inquiry in reviewing an inmate’sS 1983\nclaim for excessive force is \"whether force was applied in a\ngood-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or\nmaliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\" Brooks, 204\nF.3d at 106, citing Hudson, 503 U.S. at 7. However, injuries\nare only one of several factors that a court must consider\nin answering that question.\n\n       In determining whether a correctional officer has used\n       excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\n       courts look to several factors including: (1) the need for\n       the application of force; (2) the relationship between\n       the need and the amount of force that was used; (3)\n       the extent of the injury inflicted; (4) the extent of the\n       threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably\n       perceived by responsible officials on the basis of facts\n       known to them; and (5) any efforts made to temper the\n       severity of the forceful response.\n\n                                10\n\n\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 106, citing Hudson , 503 U.S. at 7.\nTherefore, de minimis injuries do not necessarily establish\nde minimis force.\n\n       If we were to adopt the District Court’s reasoning, a\n       prisoner could constitutionally be attacked for the sole\n       purpose of causing pain as long as the blows were\n\f       inflicted in a manner that resulted in visible (or\n       palpable or diagnosable) injuries that were de minimis.\n\nBrooks, 204 F.3d at 108.\n\nWe do not, of course, suggest that a fact finder could not\nconsider the de minimis nature of injuries along with all of\nthe other circumstances in concluding that the force that\nwas employed could not have risen to the level required for\nan Eighth Amendment violation. A properly instructed fact\nfinder could, after considering all of the evidence, conclude\nthat Smith’s injuries were so minor that the defendants’\naccount of the incident is more credible than Smith’s,\nand/or that the force used was not of constitutional\ndimension. That may have been exactly what the district\ncourt did here. However, that is an issue of fact to be\nresolved by the fact finder based upon the totality of the\nevidence; it is not an issue of law a court can decide.4\n\nPunching and kicking someone who is handcuffed behind\nhis back and under the control of at least six prison guards\nas he is being thrown into cabinets and walls is\"repugnant\nto the conscience of mankind,\" absent the extraordinary\ncircumstances necessary to justify that kind of force.\nHudson, 503 U.S. at 10. Smith alleges he was the victim of\nan unprovoked and unjustified beating. The district court\ndismissed his Eighth Amendment claims, noting that\"the\nrecord shows that defendants reasonably perceived plaintiff\nto be a threat and the need for the application of force was\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. In Brooks, we noted that when courts focus on the extent of the\ninjury, it is important to recognize that \"an inmate who is proceeding pro\nse, is in a decidedly difficult position from which to generate ‘record\nevidence’ on his behalf . . . [u]nder these circumstances, his affidavits\n. . . are about the best that can be expected from him [at summary\njudgment phase of] the proceedings.\" Brooks, 204 F.3d at 108 n.7\n(emphasis added), quoting Norman v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"671479\"><a href=\"/opinion/671479/allain-delont-norman-v-otis-taylor-deputy-sergeant/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1265 (4th\nCir. 1994) (Hall, J., dissenting).\n\n                                11\n\n\napparent.\" Smith II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">178539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. The court\nreached that conclusion in part because it found that\nSmith had created a disturbance by \"allegedly punching\nC.O. Mensinger twice in the eye,\" as well as\"continually\nstruggling with the defendants . . . .\" Id . (emphasis added).\nHowever, Smith alleges that he was handcuffed behind his\nback during the \"disturbance,\" and he maintains he did not\nhit Mensinger or struggle with the guards as they punched\nand kicked him, and rammed his head into the wall. If we\naccept Smith’s version of the facts as true, as we must,\nthere was simply no justification for the defendants’\nconduct, and the district court’s ruling to the contrary can\nnot stand.5\n\nDefendants argue that we should nevertheless affirm the\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Officers Androshick,\nMcCole, Zubris, and Jones because Smith concedes that he\n\fis not sure that they participated in the beating at all.\nHowever, the fact that Smith has acknowledged that he\ncould not see those defendants during the beating neither\nnegates their involvement nor their liability as a matter of\nlaw. Smith testified: \"Officer Yurkiewicz, Zubris,\nAndroshick, McCole, Jones, all of them was in back of me\nand they were pushing my head, right, into the cabinets in\nthe wall, cabinets and walls. And then after that, I was\nknocked to the floor.\" App. at 166 (emphasis added). He\nfurther testified: \". . . the full force of all the guards [was]\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The district court was also concerned about the potential for an\nescalating confrontation with other inmates because\"other prisoners on\nthe cell block were not locked in their cells and were being let out into\nthe yard.\" Smith II, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">178539</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. However, Smith alleges that\nthe beating occurred out of sight of the other inmates. Moreover, even if\nothers could see what was occurring, the reasonableness of the force\nused would still be an issue of fact for a jury, not an issue of law for the\ncourt. As we noted in Brooks, \"while . . . application of some force may\nhave been needed\" to maintain order, \"[the plaintiff] was shackled at the\ntime [of the beating] so that the extent of his threat to staff would not\nhave been great.\" Brooks, 204 F.3d at 106.\n\nFurthermore, even assuming that other inmates could see Smith, it is\ndifficult to understand how beating a handcuffed inmate in the presence\nof other inmates in the manner Smith alleges could reasonably be\ncalculated to reduce tension and restore order inside a prison.\n\n                                12\n\n\nbehind me, they rammed my head into the cabinet and into\nthe wall . . . No, I didn’t say he [Yurkiewicz] did. I said all\nof them.\" Id. at 168 (emphasis added). That testimony is\nsufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to\neach of those defendants. See Brooks, 204 F.3d at 109.\n\nMoreover, it is undisputed that all of the named officers\nwere in the vicinity at some point when Smith alleges he\nwas beaten. The extent of each officer’s participation is thus\na classic factual dispute to be resolved by the fact finder.\nAccordingly, we will vacate the judgment in favor of\ndefendants Novitsky, Yurkiewicz, Androshick, McCole,\nZubris, and Jones and remand the matter for further\nproceedings.\n\nC. Officer Paulukonis’ Duty to Intervene\n\nAs noted earlier, Smith does not allege that Paulukonis\ntook part in the beating. Rather, Smith claims that\nPaulukonis can be liable under the Eighth Amendment if he\nfailed to intervene. We agree. We hold that a corrections\nofficer’s failure to intervene in a beating can be the basis of\nliability for an Eighth Amendment violation underS 1983 if\nthe corrections officer had a reasonable opportunity to\nintervene and simply refused to do so. Furthermore, we\nhold that a corrections officer can not escape liability by\nrelying upon his inferior or non-supervisory rank vis-a-vis\nthe other officers.\n\fCourts have held that a police officer has a duty to take\nreasonable steps to protect a victim from another officer’s\nuse of excessive force, even if the excessive force is\nemployed by a superior. \"If a police officer, whether\nsupervisory or not, fails or refuses to intervene when a\nconstitutional violation such as an unprovoked beating\ntakes place in his presence, the officer is directly liable\nunder Section 1983.\" Byrd v.

However, an officer is only liable if there is a\nrealistic and reasonable opportunity to intervene. See Clark,\n783 F.2d at 1007 (instructing the district court upon\nremand to determine whether the officer was in a position\n\n                                13\n\n\nto intervene); Brishke, 466 F.2d at 11 (liability for failure to\nintervene exists only if the beating occurred in the officer’s\npresence or was otherwise within his knowledge); Putman,\n639 F.2d at 423-24 (liability exists only if the non-\nintervening officer saw the beating or had time to reach the\noffending officer).\n\nIn Baker v. Monroe Township, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692283\"><a href=\"/opinion/692283/inez-baker-individually-and-as-guardian-ad-litem-of-tiffany-baker-tiffany/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d. Cir.\n1995), we held that a police officer who was the senior\nofficer involved in executing a search warrant could be\nliable in a suit under S 1983 even though he did not\npersonally use excessive force, nor direct anyone else to. We\nconcluded that \"there [was] sufficient evidence to permit an\ninference that [the officer] knew of and acquiesced in the\ntreatment the [plaintiffs] were receiving at the hands of the\nother officers acting under his supervision.\" Baker, 50 F.3d\nat 1193. The specific circumstances in Baker required us to\ndetermine if the plaintiff had shown that the senior officer\nhad \"actual knowledge and acquiescence.\" Id. at 1194,\nquoting Rode v. Dellarciprete, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir.\n1988). Although the specific context of our analysis only\ninvolved an officer’s liability for the actions of police officers\nunder his supervision, we do not interpret Baker as\nsuggesting that liability for failure to intervene is solely\nlimited to supervisors or officers who outrank their\noffending colleagues.\n\nThe duty to uphold the law does not turn upon an\nofficer’s rank. It is neither affected by, nor proportional to,\na non-intervening officer’s relationship to an offending\ncolleague. The approving silence emanating from the officer\nwho stands by and watches as others unleash an\nunjustified assault contributes to the actual use of\nexcessive force, and we cannot ignore the tacit support\nsuch silence lends to those who are actually striking the\nblows. Such silence is an endorsement of the constitutional\nviolation resulting from the illegal use of force. 6 It is\nincompatible with the restrictions imposed under the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. The message that emanates from such silence was vocalized in\n\fHudson where the supervisor allegedly stood by and told officers who\nwere beating an inmate \"not to have too much fun.\" Hudson, 503 U.S.\nat 4.\n\n                                14\n\n\nEighth Amendment, and is therefore unacceptable. We will\nnot immunize such conduct by suggesting that an officer\ncan silently contribute to such a constitutional violation\nand escape responsibility for it. The restriction on cruel and\nunusual punishment contained in the Eighth Amendment\nreaches non-intervention just as readily as it reaches the\nmore demonstrable brutality of those who unjustifiably and\nexcessively employ fists, boots or clubs.\n\nAlthough our case law refers to police officers, not\ncorrections officers, this does not change our analysis.7\nBoth are law enforcement officers, both are sworn to uphold\nthe law, and both are authorized to use force (even deadly\nforce) toward that end. We are, of course, aware of the\nobvious security concerns inside the close confines of a\nprison. However, that is simply one factor that must be\nconsidered in determining if a particular application of force\nis reasonable. It does not suggest a different Eighth\nAmendment inquiry for corrections officers as opposed to\npolice officers. The law does not allow either to condone or\ncover up the use of excessive force. Similarly, neither can\nescape liability by turning either a blind eye or deaf ear to\nthe illegal conduct of their colleagues.\n\nTherefore, \"if [Smith] can show at trial that an officer\nattacked him while [Paulukonis] ignored a realistic\nopportunity to intervene, he can recover.\" Miller v. Smith,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769650\"><a href=\"/opinion/769650/bogi-miller-v-lionel-a-smith-and-kevin-brower/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (7th Cir. 2000). Moreover, neither rank\nnor supervisory status is a factor in assessing whether\nPaulukonis had \"a realistic opportunity to intervene.\" Id.8\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n7. We have, however, held that a corrections officer’s acquiescence can\nresult in liability under S 1983 in a very different context than we are\nconfronted with here. See Curtis v. Everette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"315811\"><a href=\"/opinion/315811/warren-curtis-v-angus-russell-everette/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3rd Cir.\n1973).\n\n8. Although it is clear that Paulokonis’ junior rank and lack of\nsupervisory status does not immunize him from liability for failing to\nintervene, we do not suggest that a fact finder could not conclude that\nthe conduct of a supervisor who fails to intervene is even more\nreprehensible and blameworthy than that of a more junior officer. The\nfact that rank does not shield one from liability does not mean that a\nfact finder must ignore the even greater dereliction of duty that occurs\nwhen a supervisor tolerates the kind of misconduct that is alleged here.\n\n                                15\n\n\nThere is some evidence that Paulukonis witnessed the\nbeating that his fellow officers allegedly administered to\nSmith. Smith alleges that Paulukonis stated in his\nmisconduct report that \"[t]he minimum amount of force\n\fwas used to place inmate Smith onto the floor.\" App. at\n329. This appears to be based upon first-hand observations\nPaulukonis made while standing at the door of the Unit\nManager’s office during the incident. Smith further testified\nthat the door of the office remained open throughout the\nincident and that Paulukonis saw the beating. A fact finder\ncould conclude that Paulukonis knew that his fellow\nofficers were using excessive force against Smith, had an\nopportunity to intervene, but refused to do so. Accordingly,\nthe district court erred in dismissing Smith’s Eighth\nAmendment claim against Paulukonis.\n\nD. Smith’s Due Process Claim\n\nIn a separate opinion, the district court also held that\nSmith could not establish a due process claim under Griffin\nv. Vaughn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"740238\"><a href=\"/opinion/740238/jerome-griffin-v-don-vaughn-hugh-owens-bk-smith-r-johnson-joseph/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1997). See Smith I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">151803</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5. The district court reasoned that Smith\n\"was subjected to seven months disciplinary time, a period\nof time half of that implicated in Griffin.\" Id. The court\nreasoned that, even assuming that the misconduct reports\nwere issued to cover up the use of excessive force, the\ndisciplinary sanction still did not constitute a due process\nviolation as it did not rise to the level of an\"atypical and\nsignificant hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of\nprison life.\" Id., quoting Griffin , 112 F.3d at 706.\n\nSmith argues that the district court misinterpreted the\nbasis of his due process claim. Smith does not claim that\nthe seven months disciplinary sanction was a violation of a\nliberty interest and therefore a denial of due process.\nRather, Smith claims that Mensinger issued a misconduct\nreport to retaliate against Smith for his conduct toward\nMensinger and to cover up a beating. Thus, Smith claims\nthat the misconduct report was not intended to enforce\nprison regulations at all, and it was therefore improper to\nimpose a disciplinary sanction.9 However, even assuming\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. As noted earlier, we will interpret Smith’s pro se complaint liberally.\nSee Zilich, 981 F.2d at 694.\n\n                                16\n\n\nthat the district court did misconstrue the crux of Smith’s\ndue process claim, it is nevertheless evident that the court’s\nrejection of that claim was correct.\n\nIn Sandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), an inmate had\nbeen charged with multiple disciplinary infractions, but the\ninmate’s request to produce certain witnesses at his\nhearing was refused by the hearing committee because the\nwitnesses were unavailable. The committee found the\ninmate guilty of the charged misconduct and sentenced him\nto 30 days in segregated confinement. Thereafter, he\nbrought a S 1983 suit claiming that the hearing did not\nsatisfy the requirements of due process. See Sandin, 515\nU.S. at 475-76. The Court disagreed. The Court held that\nconfinement in administrative or punitive segregation will\n\frarely be sufficient, without more, to establish the kind of\n\"atypical\" deprivation of prison life necessary to implicate a\nliberty interest. Therefore, the Court found that the\ninmate’s segregated confinement was not a denial of due\nprocess. See id. at 486.\n\nPrison disciplinary proceedings may, however, constitute\na denial of due process in the context of a civil rights action\nunder S 1983 when they are instituted for the sole purpose\nof retaliating against an inmate for his/her exercise of a\nconstitutional right. In Allah v. Seiverling, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770720\"><a href=\"/opinion/770720/michael-malik-allah-v-thomas-seiverling-robert-sparbanie-john-deletto-ben/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\nCir. 2000), we stated:\n\n       Sandin instructs that placement in administrative\n       confinement will generally not create a liberty interest.\n       Retaliation may be actionable, however, even when the\n       retaliatory action does not involve a liberty interest.\n       [G]overnment actions, which standing alone do not\n       violate the Constitution, may nonetheless be\n       constitutional torts if motivated in substantial part by\n       a desire to punish an individual for exercise of a\n       constitutional right.\n\nSeiverling, 229 F.3d at 224 (internal citations and quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\nWe have previously held that falsifying misconduct\nreports in retaliation for an inmate’s resort to legal process\nis a violation of the First Amendment guarantee of access to\nthe courts. See Millhouse v. Carlson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391852\"><a href=\"/opinion/391852/milhouse-lester-d-aka-milhouse-bey-lester-d-v-carlson-norman-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (3d\n\n                                17\n\n\nCir. 1981). In Millhouse, the inmate alleged that prison\nofficials retaliated against him by fabricating misconduct\ncharges in response to his civil rights suit against the\nprison officials. We concluded that \"[s]uch allegations, if\nproven at trial, would establish an infringement of\nMillhouse’s first amendment right of access to the courts.\"\nMillhouse, 652 F.2d at 374.\n\nAlthough Millhouse also involved an allegation that prison\nofficials fabricated misconduct charges, that case is\ndistinguishable from Smith’s because the conduct in\nMillhouse implicated a constitutional right--the First\nAmendment right to access to the courts. Smith’s purported\nliberty deprivation, on the other hand, implicates no\nconstitutional right and therefore can not overcome the\nhurdle erected by the holding in Sandin. See Sandin, 515\nU.S. at 486. Under Sandin, an administrative sentence of\ndisciplinary confinement, by itself, is not sufficient to create\na liberty interest, and Smith does not claim that another\nconstitutional right (such as access to the courts) was\nviolated. Accordingly, we hold that the district court\ncorrectly dismissed Smith’s due process claim.\n\nIn dismissing the claims, the district court correctly\nrelied upon the analysis of the Court of Appeals for the\nSecond Circuit in Freeman v. Rideout, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481329\"><a href=\"/opinion/481329/gary-wayne-freeman-v-richard-rideout/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">949</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d\n\fCir. 1986). In Freeman, an inmate brought a due process\nclaim against prison authorities under S 1983 alleging that\nthe prison officials’ use of falsified evidence and bogus\nmisconduct reports resulted in his being unconstitutionally\nconfined in punitive segregation for 30 days. See Freeman,\n808 F.2d at 951. The plaintiff was awarded damages\nfollowing a trial, but the award was reversed on appeal. The\ncourt of appeals concluded that, with respect to the\nmisconduct hearing, due process is satisfied where an\ninmate is afforded an opportunity to be heard and to defend\nagainst the allegedly falsified evidence and groundless\nmisconduct reports. Thus, so long as certain procedural\nrequirements are satisfied, mere allegations of falsified\nevidence or misconduct reports, without more, are not\nenough to state a due process claim. See id. at 953.\n\nSmith argues that \"there is more\" to his claim However,\nhe must clear two hurdles to overcome the district court’s\n\n                                18\n\n\nreliance on Freeman. First, it is now clear that the sanction\nSmith challenges (seven months disciplinary confinement)\ndoes not, on its own, violate a protected liberty interest as\ndefined in Sandin. Therefore, he can not establish that the\ndefendants’ conduct denied him substantive due process by\ninfringing upon a liberty interest. Second, he was afforded\na hearing and therefore had the opportunity to confront\nand challenge the allegedly perjured testimony offered in\nsupport of the misconduct reports. Under Freeman , that is\nall he was entitled to.\n\nSmith cites several cases in arguing that the district\ncourt erred in relying upon Freeman. However, the cases he\ncites are either distinguishable, or were decided before\nSandin, and are therefore of little precedential value.10 We\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. The cases Smith cites in support of his argument are distinguishable\nin that they allege the deprivation of a constitutional right or liberty\ninterest apart from, or in conjunction with, the inmate’s segregation from\nthe greater prison population.

However, both Rhodes and Black were\ndecided before Sandin.\n\nAlthough Smith alleges that he was cited in the misconduct reports to\ncover up the defendants’ own improper conduct, his complaint does not\n\n                                19\n\n\nsuggest a retaliatory motive that would implicate a constitutional right\nsuch as access to the courts. Accordingly, accepting Smith’s allegations\nas true, he claims only that defendants’ conduct was improper and in\nbad faith, not that it denied him the due process that must form the\nbasis of his S 1983 claims.\n\n11. In affirming the dismissal of the due process claims we do not\nsuggest that we agree with the district court’s conclusion that Smith is\nimproperly attempting to collaterally attack his state court conviction for\ndisorderly conduct. He pled nolo contendere to that charge, and that plea\ndoes not bar his due process claims here. See Thomas v.

R. EVID. 410.\ntherefore find that the district court did not err in\ndismissing Smith’s due process claims.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nAccordingly, we will affirm the district court’s dismissal of\nSmith’s due process claims.11 However, we hold that the\ndistrict court erred in dismissing Smith’s claims under the\nEighth Amendment. Consequently, we vacate the entry of\nsummary judgment in favor of defendants Novitsky,\nYurkiewicz, Androshick, McCole, Zubris, and Jones. We\nalso hold that corrections officers have a duty to intervene\nwhen other officers use excessive force irrespective of the\nrank of the offending officers. Accordingly, we will also\nreverse the dismissal of Smith’s Eighth Amendment claim\nagainst Paulukonis.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\n                                20\n\f</pre>",
