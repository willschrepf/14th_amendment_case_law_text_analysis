L. Edmondson\n                                                     CHIEF JUDGE\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fWILSON, concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc.\n\n      I concur in the Court’s denial of rehearing en banc only for the purpose of\n\nresponding to the dissents that follow. I believe that existing precedent regarding\n\nthe discretion afforded to district judges to calculate attorney’s fee awards based\n\non the longstanding lodestar analysis is clear, and not as confusing as the dissents\n\nattempt to make it out to be. Several decades of established Supreme Court\n\nprecedent make it clear that district judges are vested with discretion to enhance a\n\nfee in accordance with a federal fee-shifting statute, in the “rare” and\n\n“exceptional” case, when there is specific evidence in the record to support an\n\nexceptional result and superior performance. See Pennsylvania v. Delaware\n\nValley Citizens, Council for Clean Air (“Delaware Valley I”), 478 U.S. 546, 565,\n\n106 S. Ct. 3088, 3098, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1986); Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886,\n\n104 S. Ct. 1541, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1984).\n\n      In Blum, the Supreme Court held that the “quality of representation” and the\n\n“results obtained” from the litigation could not serve as an independent basis for\n\nincreasing the basic fee award only because the attorneys in Blum offered no\n\nevidence of an exceptional result or superior performance. Blum, 465 U.S. at 899,\n\n104 S. Ct. at 1549. That is not the case here. In Blum, the Court indicated that the\n\noutcome would have been different had the plaintiff’s attorneys “offer[ed] specific\n\n\n                                          3\n\fevidence” to demonstrate that an enhancement was necessary to reflect counsel’s\n\nperformance. Id. I find no language in Blum that can be interpreted to suggest\n\nthat upward adjustments for excellent results or superior performance are\n\ncategorically excluded. The Court stated that an upward adjustment may be\n\njustified in the “rare case where the fee applicant offers specific evidence to show\n\nthat the quality of service rendered was superior to that one reasonably should\n\nexpect in light of the hourly rates charged” and resulted in “exceptional” success.\n\nId.\n\n      Delaware Valley I presented the Supreme Court with a clear opportunity to\n\noverrule Blum, but it did not expressly do so. Rather, the Court repeatedly cited\n\nBlum with approval. See Delaware Valley I, 478 U.S. at 564, 106 S. Ct. at 3098\n\n(“We further refined our views [regarding the proper manner in which to\n\ndetermine a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee] in Blum . . . f[inding] that [the lodestar] is\n\npresumed to be the reasonable fee . . . .”); id. at 568, 106 S. Ct. at 3100 (quoting\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 897, 104 S. Ct. at 1549) (leaving questions left open in Blum to\n\nbe decided later). Additionally, the Supreme Court in Delaware Valley I echoed\n\nBlum’s non-categorical language and conducted a case-specific analysis of the\n\nenhancement at issue. See id. at 566-68, 106 S. Ct. at 3099-3100.\n\n      Moreover, the Supreme Court affirmed in Delaware Valley I that “upward\n\n\n                                           4\n\fadjustments of the lodestar figure are still permissible . . . in certain ‘rare’ and\n\n‘exceptional’ cases, supported by both ‘specific evidence’ on the record and\n\ndetailed findings by the lower courts.” Id. at 565, 106 S. Ct. at 3098 (quoting\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 898-901, 104 S. Ct. at 1548-50). See The Supreme Court, 1986\n\nTerm: Leading Cases, 101 HARV. L. REV. 270, 293 (1987) (concluding that the\n\nDelaware Valley I Court “rejected the use of an enhancement based on superior\n\nattorney performance . . . absent specific evidence that the lodestar did not provide\n\na reasonable award that reflected the quality of representation”). The dissents\n\nmischaracterize Delaware Valley I by ignoring this language, which precedes the\n\nCourt’s holding that “the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant\n\nfactors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance\n\nthe fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling\n\nplaintiffs to secure legal assistance.” Id. at 566, 106 S. Ct. at 3098. Although the\n\nCourt is clear that “the overall quality of performance ordinarily should not be\n\nused to adjust the lodestar,” the Court leaves open the possibility of an\n\nextraordinary case. Id. at 566, 106 S. Ct. at 3099 (emphasis added). Reading\n\nBlum and Delaware Valley I together, the Supreme Court has consistently\n\nindicated that, in the “rare” and “exceptional” case, the district court has the\n\ndiscretion to grant an enhancement.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      Importantly, there is no circuit split on this issue. The Second, Fourth,\n\nFifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits – all of the circuits that\n\nhave considered this issue – agree that a district court may provide an\n\nenhancement for exceptional performance. See Kenny A. v. Perdue, 532 F.3d\n\n1209, 1242 (11th Cir. 2008) (affirming a lodestar enhancement); Geier v.\n\nSundquist, 372 F.3d 784, 794-95 (6th Cir. 2004) (concluding that Delaware Valley\n\nI permits enhancements based on quality of representation and results obtained in\n\nrare and exceptional cases); Van Gerwen v. Guarantee Mut. Life Co., 214 F.3d\n\n1041, 1046 (9th Cir. 2000) (stating that, as in Blum and Delaware Valley I,\n\nupward adjustment for quality of representation “is justified only in the rare case\n\nwhere there is specific evidence that the quality of service was superior in light of\n\nthe hourly rates charged and that the success was exceptional”); Quarantino v.\n\nTiffany Co., 166 F.3d 422, 425 (2d Cir. 1999) (“The lodestar may be adjusted\n\nbased on several factors, including in particular the results obtained . . . .”)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Forshee v. Waterloo Indus., Inc.,\n\n178 F.3d 527, 532 (8th Cir. 1999) (stating that, to justify enhancement for\n\noutstanding service and results, the applicant “must establish that the quality of\n\nservice rendered and the results obtained were superior to what one reasonably\n\nshould expect in light of the hourly rates charged and the number of hours\n\n\n                                           6\n\fexpended”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Hyatt v. Apfel, 195\n\nF.3d 188, 192 (4th Cir. 1999) (affirming enhancement “on account of the\n\nexceptional results obtained . . .”); Roe v. Cheyenne Mountain Conference Resort,\n\nInc., 124 F.3d 1221, 1233 n.8 (10th Cir. 1997) (“The lodestar figure may be\n\nadjusted to suit the particular circumstances of the case, especially where the\n\ndegree of success achieved is exceptional.”); and, Shipes v. Trinity Indus., 987\n\nF.2d 311, 320 (5th Cir. 1993) (noting that upward adjustments based on quality of\n\nrepresentation and results obtained are proper where supported by specific\n\nevidence on record and detailed findings by lower courts).\n\n      The discretion to enhance an attorney’s fee is a tool uniquely within the\n\nprovince of the district judge. The district judge has an unparalleled opportunity\n\nto observe the attorney’s performance in a given case. Only the district judge can\n\nevaluate the attorney’s performance from the day he or she files the complaint to\n\nthe day the judge enters the order. Before arriving at its decision in this case, the\n\ndistrict judge set forth detailed findings to explain why the lodestar figure did not\n\nfully reflect the quality of representation and the results achieved.\n\n      Judge Tjoflat’s dissent mischaracterizes the district court’s observations and\n\nfindings in its published order as “testimony.” These findings and observations\n\nare simply explanations for the enhancement, provided because Blum and\n\n\n                                          7\n\fDelaware Valley II require that an enhancement be justified. This is not a due\n\nprocess violation. The district judge explained that he was motivated to enhance\n\nby his “own substantial experience and familiarity with the prevailing rates in\n\nAtlanta, and the Court’s observation of the stellar performance of plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel throughout this long and difficult case,” including the court’s “58 years as\n\na practicing attorney and federal judge.” Kenny A. v. Perdue, 454 F. Supp. 2d\n\n1260, 1286, 1290 (2006). The district judge is in the best position to evaluate trial\n\nlevel advocacy, and therefore is in the best position to identify when that advocacy\n\nis exceptional. Although we review the district court’s decision for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, we should afford the district court the deference and discretion to\n\nwhich it is entitled.\n\n      We need not disturb our precedents in Norman v. Housing Auth. of\n\nMontgomery, NAACP v. Evergreen, and Kenny A. because they are consistent with\n\nexisting Supreme Court precedent. Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1242; Norman v.\n\nHousing Auth. of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292, 1302 (11th Cir. 1988); NAACP v.\n\nEvergreen, 812 F.3d 1332, 1336-37 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam). Our decisions\n\nare also consistent with every other Circuit that has considered whether, and to\n\nwhat extent, exceptional performance and results can be used to enhance an\n\nattorney’s fee under the lodestar calculation. The Supreme Court has instructed\n\n\n                                          8\n\fthat a district judge should only do so in an exceptional case when there is specific\n\nevidence to support it. Kenny A. is that case.\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\fTJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:\n\n        In this case, the district judge, in undertaking the task of awarding\n\nattorney’s fees to the prevailing plaintiffs under a federal fee-shifting statute, 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988,1 decided to testify on behalf of the plaintiffs and did so ex parte,\n\nwithout notice to the defendants, in the form of statements made in the order he\n\nentered granting plaintiffs the fees they requested.2 Based on these statements – in\n\nwhich he compared plaintiffs’ counsel’s performance and the comprehensiveness\n\nof the injunction the court entered with other cases that he declined to identify –\n\nthe judge enhanced plaintiffs’ fee request by a multiplier of 1.75. Kenny A. ex rel.\n\nWinn v. Perdue, 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260 (N.D. Ga. 2006) (“Kenny A. III”). On\n\nappeal, the panel accepted the judge’s statements as probative evidence of the\n\n        1\n           Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, the pleading that contained all of the claims for relief,\ncontained 18 counts, 15 of which stated causes of action. Nine of the counts sought relief under\nthe Georgia constitution, Georgia statutes, or common law. Six of the counts sought relief under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the United States Constitution or federal statutes. Section\n1988 applied only to those six counts. The consent decree the court signed does not indicate\nwhether the decree was based on state or federal law. I assume that it was based on one or more\nof the § 1983 counts. In granting plaintiffs attorney’s fees under § 1988, neither the parties nor\nthe court appeared to have segregated out the time plaintiffs’ counsel spent litigating the state law\ncauses of action. Rather, they assumed that all of the time for which plaintiffs’ counsel asked to\nbe compensated dealt with the § 1983 claims. In extolling counsel’s performance as far superior\nto anything he had witnessed in his 27 years on the district court, the district judge did not\ncomment on, and apparently did not take account of, counsel’s performance in prosecuting\nplaintiffs’ state law claims.\n        2\n           It is clear from a reading of the district judge’s order granting plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees\nrequest that the district judge served as plaintiffs’ witness. He provided the testimony that was\ncritical and essential to the fee enhancement. See Kenny A. ex rel. Winn v. Perdue, 454 F. Supp.\n2d 1260, 1288-90 (N.D. Ga. 2006).\n\n                                                  10\n\fquality of counsel’s performance and the result plaintiffs achieved,3 and,\n\nconcluding that it was bound by precedent, NAACP v. City of Evergreen, 812\n\nF.2d 1332 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam), and Norman v. Housing Auth. of the City\n\nof Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292 (11th Cir. 1988), upheld the 1.75 fee multiplier.\n\nSee Kenny A. ex rel. Winn v. Perdue, 532 F.3d 1209, 1236-37 (11th Cir. 2008)\n\n(“Kenny A. IV”); id. at 1246 (Wilson, J., specially concurring); id. at 1251 (Hill,\n\nJ., concurring). In my view, neither NAACP nor Norman compelled the result the\n\npanel reached, nor, as Judge Carnes’s panel opinion argues, should they have.\n\n       I dissent from the court’s failure to take this case en banc. In light of the\n\nnumerous fee-shifting statutes that Judge Carnes has cited in the appendix to his\n\ndissenting opinion, the panel’s reading of NAACP and Norman, which I believe\n\ngoes beyond the cases’ holdings, will control the litigation of attorney’s fees issues\n\nin this circuit. But there are reasons other than the panel’s reading of NAACP and\n\nNorman that require the full court’s attention en banc – reasons independent of\n\nthose Judge Carnes advances.\n\n       3\n          Judge Carnes authored the panel’s majority opinion; however, part VI of the opinion,\n532 F.3d at 1220-42, which addressed the district court’s fee enhancement, represented his views\nalone. Kenny A. ex rel. Winn v. Perdue, 532 F.3d 1209, 1220 n.3 (11th Cir. 2008). Judge Hill,\nwho joined the remainder of Judge Carnes’s opinion, voted to affirm the fee enhancement solely\n“because we are bound” by NAACP and Norman. Id. at 1251 (Hill, J., concurring). None of the\nthree panel opinions referred to the district judge’s statements as testimony given ex parte and\nwithout notice or questioned whether those statements were unreviewable. Yet the panel\nnecessarily accepted the statements as probative evidence; otherwise, the panel could not have\nreached the result it did.\n\n                                              11\n\f      If my reading of NAACP and Norman, as set out in part I, is correct, the\n\ndistrict court’s decision should be vacated and the case remanded to the district\n\ncourt. I would vacate the court’s decision on two independent grounds: (1) the\n\ndecision is unreviewable; and (2) the manner in which the court used its own\n\ntestimony to enhance plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees request denied the defendants due\n\nprocess of law.\n\n      If my reading of NAACP and Norman is wrong, and their holdings required\n\nthe panel to affirm, en banc review is still necessary to determine whether – in a\n\ncase seeking the sort of injunctive relief plaintiffs sought and obtained in this case\n\n– quality of performance and the result obtained are permissible grounds for\n\nenhancing a lodestar fee that already incorporates an hourly rate at the top of the\n\nrelevant market for the type of services performed. I contend in part III that an\n\nenhancement on these grounds is not available in cases like the one before us.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      In NAACP, we vacated and remanded the district court’s decision refusing\n\nto grant an attorney’s fee enhancement. We did so due to ambiguities in the\n\ndistrict court’s stated bases for denying the enhancement and the court’s failure to\n\naddress plaintiffs’ “exceptional success” justification for a fee enhancement.\n\nNAACP, 812 F.2d at 1336-37. In Norman, we reversed and remanded the district\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcourt’s refusal to enhance the attorney’s fee award because the court used the\n\nwrong standard in assessing the significance of the results the plaintiffs had\n\nobtained. Norman, 836 F.2d at 1306.\n\n      While we did assume in those cases that, at least theoretically, “superior\n\nresults coupled with superior performance can be the basis for an enhancement of\n\nthe lodestar amount,” Kenny A. IV, 532 F.3d at 1238 (emphasis added), in neither\n\ncase did we hold that fee enhancements granted on those grounds must be\n\naffirmed. We certainly did not hold that a district court would not be abusing its\n\ndiscretion if it enhanced an attorney’s fee award on the basis of exceptional\n\nperformance or result, particularly where, as here, the court relied almost\n\nexclusively on unidentified and unreviewable personal experience, rather than\n\nspecific evidence in the record, in reaching its determination. See Blum v.\n\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 899, 104 S. Ct. 1541, 1549, 79 L. Ed. 2d 891 (1984)\n\n(requiring “specific evidence” to support an enhancement based on superior\n\nservice and exceptional success). If, as Judge Carnes’s panel opinion “readily”\n\nconcluded, “the district court’s award of a $4,500,000 enhancement to the lodestar\n\namount in this case is an abuse of discretion,” then NAACP and Norman present\n\nno impediment to vacating the fee award. Kenny A. IV, 532 F.3d at 1236.\n\n      Because, however, the panel relied on the supposedly preclusive effect of\n\n\n                                         13\n\fNAACP and Norman, the panel gave those decisions greater precedential value\n\nthan they deserve, by their own terms, in the future review of fee enhancements.\n\nShould the panel’s decision stand, there would be almost no room for a panel of\n\nthis court to find that a district court abused its discretion in granting a fee\n\nenhancement on the basis of the lawyer’s purportedly superior performance or the\n\nresult attained. For this reason alone, we should hear this case en banc to clarify\n\nand limit the reach of NAACP and Norman so that future courts will not\n\nmistakenly find their precedential effect so constraining.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       If my reading of NAACP and Norman is correct, the district court’s decision\n\nshould be vacated and the case remanded to the district court. As I explain in\n\nsubparts A and B, the decision is unreviewable and is the product of the denial of\n\ndue process of law.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       The district court’s decision to enhance the lodestar in this case through the\n\nuse of a multiplier of 1.75 ultimately was driven by the court’s personal\n\nexperience and subjective relative assessment of the lawyers’ performance.4\n\n\n       4\n         The district court also purported to rely on the following factors as evidence that the\nlodestar calculation failed to account for the quality of service rendered by plaintiffs’ counsel: (1)\nthat counsel were required to advance case expenses of $1.7 million with no ongoing\nreimbursement; (2) that counsel were not paid on an ongoing basis as the work was performed;\n\n                                                 14\n\fSpecifically,\n\n       based on its personal observation of plaintiffs’ counsel’s performance\n       throughout this litigation, the Court [found] that the superb quality of\n       their representation far exceeded what could reasonably be expected\n       for the standard hourly rates used to calculate the lodestar. Quite\n       simply, plaintiffs’ counsel brought a higher degree of skill,\n       commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this litigation than\n       the Court has seen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during\n       its 27 years on the bench.5\n\nKenny A. III, 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1288-89 (emphasis added). Along similar lines,\n\nthe district court commented that “the quality of service rendered by class counsel\n\n. . . was far superior to what consumers of legal services in the legal marketplace\n\nin Atlanta could reasonably expect to receive for the rates used in the lodestar\n\n\nand (3) that counsel’s ability to recover any fee or expense reimbursement was contingent on the\noutcome of the case. Kenny A. III, 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1288. Judge Carnes, correctly in my view,\nnoted why none of these factors are legally permissible bases for a fee enhancement. Kenny A.\nIV, 532 F.3d at 1225-28 (relying on Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air,\n478 U.S. 546, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 92 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1986), and City of Burlington v. Dague, 505\nU.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638, 120 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1992)). This leaves the district court’s personal\nviews of plaintiffs’ counsel’s performance and the result plaintiffs obtained as the only remaining\nbases for the enhancement. Id. at 1228-29.\n       5\n          The district court’s lodestar enhancement surely cannot stand to the extent that it was\nbased on counsel’s “commitment, dedication, and professionalism” displayed in the litigation.\nThese attributes are always required of officers of the court, and attorneys should never be\ncompensated – let alone compensated extra – merely for comporting themselves in a manner\nexpected of all members of the bar, regardless of the fee charged for their services. See, e.g., Ga.\nState Bar R. & Regs., Rule 4-102, Rules of Prof’l Conduct, Preamble & Rules 1.1 (Competence),\n1.3 (Diligence), 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions), 3.2 (Expediting Litigation), 3.3\n(Candor Toward the Tribunal), 3.4 (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel), 3.5 (Impartiality\nand Decorum of the Tribunal); see also LR 83.1(C), NDGa (“All lawyers practicing before this\ncourt shall be governed by and shall comply with the specific rules of practice adopted by this\ncourt and, unless otherwise provided, with the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct\ncontained in the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar of Georgia and with the decisions\nof this court interpreting these rules and standards.”).\n\n                                                15\n\fcalculation.” Id. at 1288. The court further opined “that plaintiffs’ success in this\n\ncase was truly exceptional.” Id. at 1289. Indeed, the court continued, “[a]fter 58\n\nyears as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other\n\ncase in which a plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a\n\ncomprehensive scale.” Id. at 1290.\n\n      The district judge arrived at the fee enhancement by comparing counsel’s\n\nperformance and the result obtained in this case with the attorneys’ performance\n\nand the result plaintiffs obtained in other cases. The court did not identify the\n\nother cases, the comparators, but I assume that they were cases over which the\n\ndistrict judge presided and that they were class actions in which the plaintiffs\n\nsought equitable relief as sweeping, or nearly so, as what plaintiffs sought in this\n\ncase. Indulging this assumption, the judge’s statements regarding the quality of\n\ncounsel’s representation and the result plaintiffs achieved invite a multitude of\n\nquestions, none of which the judge answered, including:\n\n      •      What quality of representation would “consumers of legal services in\n\n             the legal marketplace in Atlanta” have expected to receive for the\n\n             rates used in the lodestar the district judge fixed in this case?\n\n      •      What cases was the district judge using as comparators? Were they\n\n             cases in which the attorneys claimed a far lower fee? (If so, counsel\n\n\n                                          16\n\f               in this case should have been expected to bring “a higher degree of\n\n               skill” to their task in order to earn the higher requested hourly rate.)\n\n       •       What definition of “success” did the court use?\n\n       •       What level of success did plaintiffs’ counsel achieve in the\n\n               comparators? Assuming that the level of success they achieved was\n\n               lower than what counsel achieved in this case, why was it so?\n\n       The district judge provided no clue as to the answers to these questions.\n\nAccordingly, the critical portions of the record for review – the specific\n\nevidentiary facts on which the decision turned – do not exist. It is well-established\n\nthat “no enhancement is permissible unless there is specific evidence in the record\n\nto show that the quality of representation was superior to that which one would\n\nreasonably expect in light of the rates claimed.” Norman, 836 F.2d at 1302 (citing\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 899, 104 S. Ct. at 1549) (emphasis added). A district judge’s\n\nmental impressions that are based on unknown facts cannot be reviewed.6\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       6\n          While we have previously suggested that a district judge may base a fee enhancement\ndecision on his own knowledge and experience, see Norman, 836 F.2d at 1303, this option, even\nif properly available, does not relieve the judge of the obligation of identifying on the record the\nspecific facts supporting the enhancement decision, see Blum, 465 U.S. at 899, 104 S. Ct. at\n1549 (requiring \"specific evidence\" to support an enhancement based on superior service and\nexceptional success). Here, the district judge relied only on generalized, conclusory findings,\nkeeping the factual premises of those findings locked away inside his personal recollection,\nshielded from challenge or appellate review. Such conclusions are insufficient to support an\nenhancement.\n\n                                                 17\n\f       The district judge provided the critical evidence that plaintiffs needed to\n\nobtain an enhancement of the lodestar that they proposed and that the court\n\naccepted as full compensation for services rendered. The evidence was\n\ntestimonial and was given ex parte and without notice to the defendants.7 In\n\narriving at his fee-award decision in this manner, the judge denied defendants\n\nfundamental due process of law. “[I]t is not proper to admit ex parte evidence,\n\ngiven by witnesses not under oath and not subject to cross-examination by the\n\nopposing party.” Hornsby v. Allen, 326 F.2d 605, 608 (5th Cir. 1964).8 The\n\ndistrict judge was required to afford defendants the right of cross-examination and,\n\ndepending on what cross-examination might disclose, an opportunity to put on\n\n\n       7\n           I have not overlooked the possibility that the district judge, in comparing the quality of\ncounsel’s performance and the result plaintiffs attained with the quality of attorney performance\nand the result attained in the comparator cases, was effectively taking judicial notice of the\nquality of performance and result in those other cases. If that is what the judge was doing, it is\nno less troubling than his ex parte testimony is.\n        First, “[a] judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is\neither (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of\naccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be\nquestioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Clearly, the issues here are subject to reasonable dispute, and\nthe accuracy of the court’s determination of the relative merits of plaintiffs’ counsel’s\nperformance and the result as compared to other cases can be, and have been, questioned.\nSecond, the district judge afforded the defendants no opportunity to be heard, as required by Fed.\nR. Evid. 201(e), “as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed.”\nIn sum, not only were the facts of which the judge may have taken judicial notice not proper\nsubjects of such notice, but the court denied the defendants the procedural protections guaranteed\nby the rules of evidence.\n       8\n        In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court\nadopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to\nOctober 1, 1981.\n\n                                                  18\n\frebutting evidence.9 It is obvious to me that the district judge failed to\n\ncomprehend the due process implications of what he was doing. Had he been\n\naware of those implications, he would have been faced with two choices: he could\n\n(1) announce his intent to testify as a plaintiff’s witness; or (2) put aside his\n\npersonal opinion of counsel’s performance and the result attained and, instead,\n\npoint to other specific evidence in the record as the bases for his attorney’s fees\n\ndecision.\n\n       The first choice would have required his recusal from the case. When a\n\n       9\n           In theory, defendants could have exercised their right of cross-examination had they\nmoved the court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 for a new trial. Rule 59(a)(2) provides,\n        Further Action After a Nonjury Trial. After a nonjury trial, the court may, on\n        motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional\n        testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and\n        direct the entry of a new judgment.\nAn attorney’s fee hearing under a fee shifting statute is essentially a nonjury trial limited to the\nissue of fees. Therefore, Rule 59(a)(2) provides a mechanism by which a defendant, ambushed\nby previously-undisclosed judicial testimony in the dispositive fee order, could obtain a re-\nopening of the proceedings in order to cross-examine the new witness (the judge), introduce\nrebuttal evidence if necessary, and obtain new findings of fact and conclusions of law on the\nbasis of a record so augmented. If the judge granted the Rule 59(a)(2) motion, the defendant\nwould no doubt follow with a motion for recusal unless the judge recused sua sponte. Whether a\ndefendant in a case such as the one at hand must resort to Rule 59(a)(2) relief in order to preserve\nits argument that the court’s utilization of its own ex parte testimony, given without notice,\noperated as a denial of due process is open to question. I would answer the question in the\nnegative for two reasons: (1) a motion for a new trial is not a prerequisite for the direct appeal of\nthe attorney’s fees decision; therefore, such a motion is not necessary to preserve the due process\nissue this case presents; and (2) the scenario associated with processing the new trial motion\nwould likely be unpleasant. In this case, defendants have not asserted the denial of due process\nas a basis for disturbing the district court’s attorney’s fees decision. The issue is, however,\ninextricably intertwined with the question of whether the court’s decision is unreviewable for the\nreasons I have posited, and defendants were not required to assert in their principal brief that the\ndecision under review is unreviewable. Unreviewability is a matter the court of appeals notices\non its own initiative.\n\n                                                 19\n\fjudge becomes a material witness in a case over which he is presiding, he must\n\nrecuse and let another judge take over. The judicial disqualification statute\n\nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n       (a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall\n       disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might\n       reasonably be questioned.\n       (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\n             (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice\n             concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed\n             evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), (b)(1). Where, as here, the district judge feels compelled to\n\ntestify – here as a plaintiff’s witness – to his personal knowledge and experience,\n\nthe judge clearly has, and has chosen to offer, “personal knowledge of disputed\n\nevidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.” Id. § 455(b)(1). Whether, in\n\naddition, the judge actually has a personal bias or prejudice in favor of the party\n\nwhom his testimony benefits is less clear, although the judge’s opinion here is\n\nreplete with unrestrained and glowing praise for plaintiffs’ counsel, suggesting a\n\ndistinct possibility of such bias or prejudice. But, by testifying on behalf of a\n\nparty, there is little doubt that, at a minimum, the judge’s impartiality might\n\nreasonably be questioned. Id. § 455(a). In such a circumstance, the need for\n\nrecusal is clear.\n\n                                           III.\n\n\n                                           20\n\f       In this part, I assume that my reading of NAACP and Norman is wrong and\n\nthat their holdings required the panel to affirm the enhancement of the lodestar by\n\na multiple of 1.75. En banc review would still be necessary to explore the\n\nproposition that quality of performance and result may be employed in a class\n\naction brought under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to\n\nenhance a lodestar already reflecting an hourly rate prevailing at the top of the\n\nrelevant market. I contend that neither factor would be an appropriate basis for an\n\nenhancement. I consider first the result reached, then the quality of performance.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Aside from the procedural deficiencies associated with the lodestar\n\nenhancement in this case, it appears to me that an attorney’s fee enhancement\n\nbased on “exceptional” or “superior” results can never be appropriate in a class\n\naction, like this one, in which plaintiffs sought sweeping equitable relief.10\n\nAssuming that a court sitting in equity properly discharges its function in entering\n\na just and legally appropriate injunction, whether following a bench trial or after\n\n\n       10\n           Comparing class actions seeking equitable relief, as in this case, with class actions\nseeking money damages is like comparing apples and oranges. In granting equitable relief, the\ndistrict court is concerned with whether the injunction it enters is narrowly tailored to provide\nonly such relief as is necessary to prevent the future repetition of the legal wrong the court has\nfound and whether the injunction is enforceable through the court’s contempt power. In\napproving the settlement of a damages action, the court is not faced with those concerns. Rather,\nits concern is with the fairness of the settlement to all parties. In a money damages case, once the\nsettlement is approved, the court is no longer involved.\n\n                                                21\n\fconsideration of a consent decree crafted by the parties, there can be but one\n\nqualitative result; in no such case can one result be any more “exceptional” than,\n\nor “superior” to, another.\n\n      In any case in equity, such as the Rule 23(b)(2) class action at hand, the\n\njudge, sitting as a chancellor, has an obligation to do justice under the\n\ncircumstances. See Coral Springs Street Sys., Inc. v. City of Sunrise, 371 F.3d\n\n1320, 1340 (11th Cir. 2004) (“It is a bedrock principle of courts of equity that they\n\nmay impose the substantive remedy of injunctive relief only when fundamental\n\nfairness and justice demand it.” (emphasis in original)). The court can reach its\n\njudgment in one of two ways. It can hold a nonjury trial, in which case the court\n\nhas all of the evidence before it and the opportunity to engage the witnesses and\n\nthe attorneys in an effort to muster the information necessary to fashion an\n\nappropriate injunction. Alternatively, the court can enter a consent decree, in\n\nwhich case it must rely heavily on the competence of counsel to craft a legally\n\nappropriate injunction.\n\n      Under either approach – a bench trial or a consent decree – the court’s\n\nobligation is the same. First, the final judgment must be fair and just under the\n\ncircumstances. Second, because the decree will be enforced through the court’s\n\ncivil contempt power, the decree’s injunctive provisions must be enforceable,\n\n\n                                          22\n\fmeaning capable of feasible enforcement. To the extent they are not, the\n\nprovisions should not be entered, as the issuance of an injunctive order that cannot\n\nbe enforced breeds disrespect for the rule of law. Thus, in considering whether to\n\nenter a consent decree, a court must ask itself the same questions it would ask in\n\nassessing the adequacy and propriety of its own order after finding for the\n\nplaintiffs at the end of a bench trial: Are the injunctive provisions to be entered\n\nnot only fair and just under the circumstances, but are they also capable of\n\nenforcement through the court’s civil contempt power? Do they reach only as far\n\nas is necessary to right the wrong, to give the plaintiffs the relief to which they are\n\nlegally entitled but not more? Are they tailored as narrowly as is necessary to\n\neffect the appropriate relief?\n\n        This evaluative rubric will produce one of three qualitative assessments: (1)\n\nthe order will do justice and give the plaintiffs what the law allows; (2) the order\n\nwill give the plaintiffs more relief than the law allows, which is plainly improper;11\n\n\n        11\n           If, in a given case, a proposed consent decree would afford the plaintiffs a level of\nrelief greater than they would be entitled to receive under a decree the court would fashion –\nbecause the consent decree would give the plaintiffs more than the law would allow – the district\ncourt should not approve the decree. In the case before us, the district court indicated that the\nconsent decree may have provided plaintiffs with more than the law would allow. See Kenny A.\nIII, 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1289-90 (“Indeed, the Court has previously recognized that even if\nplaintiffs had prevailed in a trial of this case, it is doubtful that they would have obtained relief as\n‘intricately detailed and comprehensive’ as that contained in the Consent Decree.”); see also\nKenny A. IV, 532 F.3d at 1230 (“To the extent that the district court rewarded plaintiffs’ counsel\nwith an enhancement for obtaining better results than the class would have received had the case\nbeen resolved on the merits, that is plainly wrong. . . . [T]he fee shifting statutes are not designed\n\n                                                  23\n\for (3) the order will provide less relief than the law allows, which would be\n\nunconscionable and unjust. Every entered injunctive order or decree should fall\n\ninto the first category; a court should never enter an order or approve a consent\n\ndecree falling into the second or third category. Accordingly, in any given\n\nequitable case, there can be but one legally proper result.\n\n       In this case, we must assume that the consent decree approved by the district\n\ncourt was prepared by competent counsel on both sides and was crafted to be just\n\nand legally appropriate under the circumstances, affording the plaintiff class no\n\nmore and no less than that to which it was legally entitled. Were this not the case,\n\nthe district court would not – and should not – have approved it. It is against this\n\nnecessary background assumption that we must review whether the result the\n\nconsent decree provided could ever be deemed “exceptional” or “superior” relative\n\nto the result the district court would have fashioned had it tried the case or the\n\nresults reached in other comparable cases. As a matter of law and logic, it cannot.\n\n\nto provide representation that will win plaintiffs more than a correct application of substantive\nand remedial law entitles them to receive. . . . To put it in an either-or manner, superb results are\neither what a fair application of the law produces, which means that they are not truly ‘superb,’ or\nthey are results that exceed what the law allows and for that reason are beyond the purpose of the\nfee-shifting statutes.”). Thus, no fee award, whether or not enhanced beyond an appropriately-\ncalculated lodestar, should ever exceed fair market compensation for obtaining the maximum\nlevel of relief to which the client is legally entitled. Applied to the present context, if any of the\nunidentified comparator cases contemplated by the district court involved (1) receipt by plaintiffs\nof all the relief allowed by law, yet (2) no lodestar enhancement of the attorney’s fees, then the\nlawyers here, who necessarily provided their clients no more “exceptional” a result, should not\ndo any better in terms of fees on the basis of the result obtained in the litigation.\n\n                                                 24\n\f       “Exceptional” has been defined as “constituting, or occurring as, an\n\nexception; not ordinary or average; esp., much above average in quality, ability,\n\netc.” Webster’s New World Dictionary 473 (3d college ed. 1988). “Superior”\n\nmeans “greater in quality or value than . . . above average in quality; excellent.”\n\nId. at 1344. The result in one case can only be deemed “exceptional” or “superior”\n\nin relation to the result the district judge would have fashioned had he tried the\n\ncase to a conclusion or the result he approved or fashioned in an appropriate\n\ncomparator case. A proper comparator case in this situation would be another\n\nRule 23(b)(2) class action seeking equitable relief.12\n\n       However, assuming, as we must, that a comparator case involved an order\n\nor consent decree whose injunctive provisions both (1) were fair and just under the\n\ncircumstances, affording the plaintiffs all the relief to which they were legally\n\nentitled but no more, and (2) were feasibly enforceable, it is hard to see how the\n\nresult in this case could be qualitatively “superior” or “exceptional.” Indeed, were\n\na district court to have found the result in the case before it to be “exceptional” or\n\n“superior” relative to comparator cases, it necessarily would have to conclude that\n\n\n       12\n          The ideal comparators in this case would also involve broad injunctive remedies in\nwhich the court placed numerous affirmative obligations on governmental service bureaucracies.\nHowever, because all injunctive relief, no matter how sweeping or detailed, must meet the same\nequitable criteria and any such case can have but one legally-appropriate result, the inexorable\nconclusion that no properly-crafted injunctive remedy can be any more “exceptional” than or\n“superior” to the next applies regardless of what type of equity case serves as the comparator.\n\n                                              25\n\fthe injunctions in the other cases were unconscionable, unjust, or unenforceable\n\nand, ipso facto, should never have been entered.\n\n      In this case, in which the district judge presumably relied on comparator\n\ncases from his own body of judicial experience, his finding that the result in this\n\ncase was “exceptional” and “superior” enough to justify a fee enhancement\n\nimplicitly denigrates his own prior judgments by suggesting that they failed to\n\nsatisfy the standard for proper equitable relief and that he never should have\n\nentered them. I am unwilling to assume that the district judge erred in deciding\n\nthose prior cases – nor could I reach such a conclusion in any event because, as the\n\ndistrict judge has not disclosed which other cases he was considering, I have no\n\nway to know which decisions to evaluate. Therefore, I have to assume that the\n\ninjunctive relief awarded in the comparator cases was every bit as just, fair, and\n\nenforceable as the relief in this case and, accordingly, no less “exceptional.”\n\n      The upshot is that, in the context of equitable relief, no properly-crafted\n\ninjunction can be more “exceptional” than or “superior” to any other. As such, it\n\ncan never be appropriate to enhance the attorney’s fees in a case seeking\n\ninjunctive relief on the basis of “exceptional” or “superior” results.\n\n                                          B.\n\n      In light of what the Supreme Court has said regarding the proper\n\n\n                                          26\n\fcomposition and function of the lodestar,13 I am convinced that the district court\n\nwas precluded from enhancing the admittedly adequate lodestar on the basis of\n\ncounsel’s performance. “[T]he lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the\n\nrelevant factors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and it is unnecessary to\n\nenhance the fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of\n\nenabling plaintiffs to secure legal assistance.” Pennsylvania v. Del. Valley\n\nCitizen’s Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S. 546, 566, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 3098, 92 L.\n\nEd. 2d 439 (1986). The lodestar is normally already assumed to account for the\n\ndifficulty and cost of the case and the performance rendered by the attorney. The\n\nproper way to account for attorney performance is in setting the hourly rate, not in\n\nenhancing the lodestar.\n\n       In the case at hand, however, there is evidence that, in calculating the\n\nlodestar, the district court used hourly rates already at the top of the relevant\n\n\n       13\n           Judge Carnes’s panel opinion canvasses, accurately I believe, the Supreme Court’s\npronouncements about the composition and function of the lodestar. See Kenny A. IV, 532 F.3d\nat 1220-24. In a nutshell, the Court has long advised that the lodestar – the “product of\nreasonable hours times a reasonable rate” – “is presumed to be the reasonable fee contemplated\nby [42 U.S.C. ] § 1988.” Blum, 465 U.S. at 897, 104 S. Ct. at 1548. The Court has further\nemphasized that “[a] strong presumption that the lodestar figure . . . represents a ‘reasonable’ fee\nis wholly consistent with the rationale behind the usual fee-shifting statute.” Del. Valley, 478\nU.S. at 565, 106 S. Ct. at 3098 (emphasis added). In addition, fee shifting statutes “were not\ndesigned as a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys . . . . Instead, the\naim of such statutes was to enable private parties to obtain legal help in seeking redress for\ninjuries resulting from the actual or threatened violation of specific federal laws.” Id. In other\nwords, the lodestar is intended to provide full compensation for the legal services rendered, but\nno more than that.\n\n                                                27\n\fmarket for the type and character of legal services performed. Neither the\n\nSupreme Court nor this court has addressed the question of whether a\n\nperformance-based fee enhancement may push the lodestar hourly rate above the\n\nupper end of the prevailing market rate. If it may, then the resulting lodestar\n\nwould yield a fee higher than necessary to serve the purposes of the fee shifting\n\nstatutes – fairly compensating attorneys for the work performed, but only at a rate\n\nhigh enough to ensure their clients’ access to legal services. Therefore, I believe\n\nthat a lodestar hourly rate that is already at the top of the relevant market is simply\n\nineligible for an additional enhancement.\n\n       A fee enhancement might conceivably be appropriate where an attorney\n\nquotes his client an hourly rate at the outset of the case, and later submits that rate\n\nto the court as his reasonable rate, yet that hourly rate ultimately proves to be\n\ninsufficient in light of what the case in fact required the attorney to do.14 Perhaps\n\nin the beginning the attorney did not accurately predict or appreciate how much\n\ntime or effort the case would require, the level of resources he would have to\n\ndevote, or the complexity of the issues that would arise. In short, an attorney who\n\nfinds himself in over his head, stuck with an inadequate hourly rate, may be able to\n\n\n\n       14\n           I assume a case in which the requested hourly rate was somewhere below the top of\nthe relevant market and even the enhanced hourly rate would not exceed an hourly rate prevailing\nat the upper end of the market.\n\n                                              28\n\fwarrant relief in the form of a fee enhancement in order to obtain full and fair\n\ncompensation for the work actually performed.\n\n      The situation is very different, however, when, as should more typically be\n\nthe case, the attorney does not request an hourly rate until the end of the litigation\n\nand the submission of the fee application. At this stage, the attorney already\n\nknows how much time, skill, effort, and expense he has devoted to the case. With\n\nthis knowledge, he is able to determine the combination of hours and hourly rate\n\nthat will compensate him adequately for his services, in light of the results\n\nobtained and the prevailing rates in the relevant market for comparable legal\n\nservices. Attorneys know how to value their own services, and this fully\n\ncompensatory rate is the one that the attorney should request. Having already\n\nincluded every factor properly bearing on compensation – including the degree of\n\nthe attorney’s performance and the results obtained in the litigation – there is no\n\nneed or justification for an enhancement on top of this. Anything over and above\n\nthis fully and fairly compensatory fee, to be candid, could only be the product of\n\nthe attorney’s greed or the judge’s favoritism. Neither ground is, or should be,\n\npermitted under the fee shifting statutes or sanctioned by this court.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n      I conclude where I began. The court ought to rehear this case en banc for\n\n\n                                          29\n\freasons aplenty.\n\n\n\n\n                   30\n\fCARNES, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, in which\nTJOFLAT and DUBINA, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n      Although I have been on the short end of en banc votes before, this is the\n\nfirst time in sixteen years on the bench that I have written, or even joined, a dissent\n\nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc. I take this unusual step to explain why I\n\nbelieve that in this case “a United States court of appeals has decided an important\n\nquestion of federal law that has not been, but should be, settled by [the Supreme]\n\nCourt.” Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).\n\n      The important, unresolved question this case presents is one that affects the\n\nproper application of at least one hundred federal fee-shifting statutes that allow\n\nthe prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney’s fee from the losing party.\n\nIn arriving at an attorney’s fee award, a district court calculates a lodestar amount\n\nby multiplying the reasonable number of hours worked, which reflects the\n\ndifficulty of the case, by an hourly rate that fully reflects the attorney’s skill and\n\nexperience. See Penn. v. Del. Valley Citizens’ Council for Clean Air, 478 U.S.\n\n546, 563, 106 S. Ct. 3088, 3097 (1986); Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433,\n\n103 S. Ct. 1933, 1939 (1983). The question is whether a district court can then\n\nincrease the award beyond that reasonable amount based on its finding that the\n\nattorney’s performance was of superior quality and the results achieved were\n\nexceptional.\n\n                                           31\n\f       My court of appeals has answered that question “yes” in this case by\n\naffirming the district court’s judgment, which included a $4.5 million\n\nenhancement based on a number of factors, the most important of which were\n\nwhat the district court found to be superior performance and exceptional results.\n\nKenny A. ex rel Winn v. Perdue, 532 F.3d 1209, 1218 (11th Cir. 2008) (majority\n\nopinion);1 id. at 1225, 1242 (Carnes, J., concurring); id. at 1247, 1249 (Wilson, J.,\n\nconcurring); id. at 1251 (Hill, J., concurring); see also Kenny A. ex rel Winn v.\n\nPerdue, 454 F. Supp. 2d 1260, 1288–90 (N.D. Ga. 2006). The performance and\n\nresults component was so important to the district court’s enhancement decision\n\nthat we declined to vacate and remand the enhancement on other grounds,\n\nconcluding that it would be futile to do so given the primacy of that component.\n\nId. at 1242 (Carnes, J., concurring) (recognizing that the district court improperly\n\ntook contingency and other factors into account but explaining that it would be\n\nfutile to remand on those grounds because “[t]he district court was so obviously\n\nenamored with the performance of plaintiffs’ counsel and with the result that they\n\nachieved, and so determined to reward them for it, that we have no doubt the court\n\n\n\n       1\n         Judge Hill joined Parts I–V and VII of the lead opinion, which I authored, making those\nparts a majority opinion. See id. at 1220 n.3. Neither he nor Judge Wilson joined Part VI of the\nlead opinion, and for that reason I refer to it as a concurring opinion by me. Although Part VI of\nthe lead opinion is not part of the majority opinion, the pronoun “we” was used throughout it for\ncontinuity purposes.\n\n                                                32\n\fwould simply reinstate the enhancement”); see also id. at 1242, 1248 (Wilson, J.,\n\nconcurring) (agreeing that the district court should not have considered the\n\ncontingency factor in making its enhancement decision but voting to affirm the\n\nfull amount of the enhancement anyway).\n\n      Two of the three judges on the panel voted to affirm the multi-million dollar\n\nenhancement part of the fee award in this case because they were bound to follow\n\nestablished circuit law that a district court may take a reasonable attorney’s fee\n\naward and enhance it for what the court views as extraordinary performance and\n\nresults. Id. at 1236–38 (Carnes, J., concurring); id. at 1251 (Hill, J., concurring);\n\nsee generally Norman v. Hous. Auth. of Montgomery, 836 F.2d 1292, 1302 (11th\n\nCir. 1988); NAACP v. City of Evergreen, 812 F.2d 1332, 1336–37 (11th Cir.\n\n1987). The third judge on the panel voted to affirm the enhancement both\n\nbecause binding circuit law permits it and because he reads Blum v. Stenson, 465\n\nU.S. 886, 104 S. Ct. 1541 (1984), as “establish[ing] that enhancements for quality\n\nof representation and exceptional results, while not warranted in most cases, are\n\npermissible where supported by specific evidence.” Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1243,\n\n1246 (Wilson, J., concurring).\n\n      The Supreme Court speculated on this issue in the Blum case, but the facts\n\ndid not present it. There was no specific evidence in that case to support the\n\n\n                                          33\n\fdistrict court’s conclusory findings that, among other things, the quality of legal\n\nservices was superior to what one should reasonably expect and that the results\n\nobtained were exceptional. Blum, 465 U.S. at 898–99, 104 S. Ct. at 1548–49.\n\n       The Court reversed the enhancement in the Blum case. Id. at 902, 104 S.\n\nCt. at 1550. Therefore, what the Blum decision establishes, and all that it\n\nestablishes, is that absent specific evidence and findings an enhancement for the\n\nquality of representation or results obtained is not permitted. See id. at 901–02;\n\n104 S. Ct. at 1550; see also Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1221–22 (Carnes, J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n      The Blum case does not establish as law the proposition that with specific\n\nevidence and findings an enhancement for superior representation and exceptional\n\nresults is permissible. It could not. A decision in a case where particular facts are\n\nnot present cannot establish the law governing cases where those facts are present.\n\nAny statements, and certainly any implications from statements, in the Blum\n\nopinion about what might have been the result if the facts had been different are\n\nnothing more than dicta. See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 399-400, 19 U.S.\n\n264 (1821) (“It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every\n\nopinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are\n\nused. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control\n\n\n                                         34\n\fthe judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision.”)\n\n(Marshall, C.J.); United States v. Santos, 553 U.S.___, 128 S. Ct. 2020, 2031\n\n(2008) (plurality opinion) (speculations that address a case not before the Court\n\n“are the purest of dicta”); Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist.\n\nNo. 1, 551 U.S. —, 127 S. Ct. 2738, 2762 (2007) (plurality opinion); Cent. Va.\n\nCmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 363, 126 S. Ct. 990, 996 (2006).2\n\n       2\n           There is this passage in the Blum opinion:\n\n       [W]e reiterate what was said in Hensley: “where a plaintiff has obtained excellent\n       results, his attorney should recover a fully compensatory fee. Normally this will\n       encompass all hours reasonably expended on the litigation, and indeed in some\n       cases of exceptional success an enhancement award may be justified.” Hensley,\n       461 U.S., at [435], 103 S. Ct., at 1940. We therefore reject petitioner’s argument\n       that an upward adjustment to an attorney’s fee is never appropriate under § 1988.\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 901, 104 S. Ct. at 1550 (footnote omitted). The speculative “may be”\nlanguage is “the purest of dicta,” Santos, 128 S. Ct. at 2801 (plurality opinion), because the\nenhancement in Blum was reversed instead of affirmed. The quote from Hensley is itself the\npurest of dicta because that case involved the reduction of an attorney’s fee award for partial\nsuccess, not the enhancement of one for more success than was expected. Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n426, 103 S. Ct. at 1935–36.\n\n         For what it is worth, I agree with the literal statement in the dicta of the last sentence of\nthe quote from Blum, which rejects the argument that an upward adjustment of a fee award is\nnever appropriate. While I believe that enhancements are never appropriate for superior\nperformance and exceptional results, see Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1220–42 (Carnes, J., concurring),\nthey may well be appropriate in other situations, especially those involving unpopular clients or\ncauses where the attorney suffers from the representation in ways not compensated by the\nlodestar, id. at 1233–34 (giving three examples); see also Guam Soc. of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists v. Ada, 100 F.3d 691, 698–99 (9th Cir. 1996) (concluding that enhancement was\nappropriate where case was extremely controversial and attorney received death threats during\nthe course of the litigation). No one contends that this is a case where the clients were detested,\nthe litigation was unpopular, or the attorneys’ standing in their profession or community suffered\nin the least. In fact, just the opposite is true. Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1234–35 (Carnes, J.,\nconcurring); cf. Applegate v. United States, 52 Fed. Cl. 751, 773 (Fed. Cl. 2002) (reversing\njudgment awarding enhancement where “the facts here demonstrate that [plaintiffs’ counsel] was\n\n                                                 35\n\f       The Supreme Court had another go at the issue two years later in the\n\nDelaware Valley case. The court of appeals had affirmed an enhancement based\n\nin part on the superior quality of the representation and the exceptional nature of\n\nthe success achieved. Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 554–56, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n3093–94. The Supreme Court held that the enhancement was improper. Id. at\n\n567–68, 106 S. Ct. at 3099–3100. In explaining why, the Court made statements\n\nindicating that it was categorically ruling out enhancements for superior\n\nperformance and by extension superior results. See id. at 564–66, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n3098–3100. For example, the Court stated that the special skill and experience of\n\ncounsel, the quality of representation, and the results obtained “are presumably\n\nfully reflected in the lodestar amount, and thus cannot serve as independent bases\n\nfor increasing the basic fee award.” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 565, 106 S. Ct.\n\nat 3098. And the Court said this about superior performance enhancements: “In\n\nshort, the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors\n\nconstituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance the fee\n\nfor superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling\n\nplaintiffs to secure legal assistance.” Id. at 566, 106 S. Ct. at 3098; see also id. at\n\n\n\nnot prosecuting an unattractive case, but rather pursuing a cause celeb—the type of case that a\nfirm with local roots likely would embrace and seek to publicize to its clients and prospective\nclients as an indication of its community involvement”).\n\n                                               36\n\f566, 106 S. Ct. at 3099 (“[T]he overall quality of performance ordinarily should\n\nnot be used to adjust the lodestar, thus removing any danger of ‘double\n\ncounting’”).\n\n      Those categorical statements are clear, and if the Delaware Valley opinion’s\n\ndiscussion had ended there everyone would agree that this type of enhancement\n\nhad been categorically ruled out. The problem is that the discussion did not end\n\nwith those statements. Instead, there was a “furthermore.” After explaining why\n\nthe quality of the performance or the results obtained cannot serve as bases for\n\nenhancing the fee award, the Court stated that “[f]urthermore” there was neither\n\nspecific evidence nor specific findings in that case about why the results were so\n\noutstanding or why the quality of representation was not fully reflected in the\n\nlodestar. Id. at 567–68, 106 S. Ct. at 3099. And “[i]n the absence of such\n\nevidence and such findings,” the Court could “find no reason to increase the fee\n\naward” based on the quality of representation. Id. at 568, 106 S. Ct. at 3099–3100.\n\n      There are two ways to interpret the Delaware Valley decision and its\n\n“furthermore” discussion. One way is to read the decision as containing two\n\nalternative holdings: an enhancement for superior representation and exceptional\n\nresults is never permitted; and, even if it were, there was insufficient evidence or\n\nfindings of anything special in that case. See Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1239–41\n\n\n                                         37\n\f(Carnes, J., concurring). The other way is to read Delaware Valley as containing\n\nnot two alternative holdings, but only one, which is that such enhancements are\n\nnot allowed absent specific evidence and findings to support the conclusion that\n\nthe quality of representation and results obtained were truly special. See Kenny\n\nA., 532 F.3d at 1243–45 (Wilson, J., concurring); Geier v. Sundquist, 372 F.3d\n\n784, 794–95 (6th Cir. 2004). Under that view, everything before the\n\n“furthermore” in the Delaware Valley opinion is not an alternative holding but\n\nonly dicta.\n\n      If my alternative holdings interpretation of Delaware Valley is correct, then\n\nthe law of this circuit and of the Sixth Circuit is flatly contrary to Supreme Court\n\nprecedent, which needs to be clarified so that it will no longer be misinterpreted as\n\nholding exactly the opposite of what it does. If, instead, the narrow interpretation\n\nof the Delaware Valley decision is correct, then the Supreme Court has yet to\n\nhold—not imply, intimate, or suggest in dicta but actually hold—whether the\n\nfederal fee-shifting statutes allow an enhancement when there is specific evidence\n\nand findings of superior performance and unexpected results.\n\n      The issue is clearly and squarely presented in this case. Two of the panel\n\nmembers in this case sharply disagreed and wrote about the meaning and effect of\n\nthe Blum and Delaware Valley decisions, both of which reversed instead of\n\n\n                                         38\n\faffirmed enhancements for superior performance and results. Those two panel\n\nmembers also disagreed about the effect on this issue of the reasoning in City of\n\nBurlington v. Dague, 505 U.S. 557, 112 S. Ct. 2638 (1992), which is the Court’s\n\nlast decision on the subject of lodestar enhancements. Compare Kenny A., 532\n\nF.3d at 1221–33, 1239–41 (Carnes, J., concurring) with id. at 1242–49 (Wilson, J.,\n\nconcurring). The third panel member kept his views about that matter to himself.\n\nSee id. at 1251 (Hill, J., concurring). The bottom line for certiorari review\n\npurposes, however, is that the law of the Eleventh Circuit permits this kind of\n\nenhancement, and that law was applied to permit a $4.5 million enhancement of\n\nthe lodestar amount in this case. See id. at 1236–39, 1242 (Carnes, J.,\n\nconcurring); id. at 1242, 1251 (Wilson, J., concurring); id. at 1251 (Hill, J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n      The decision whether to affirm or vacate the $4.5 million enhancement part\n\nof the attorney’s fee award turns on whether an enhancement for superior\n\nperformance and exceptional results is permissible. If boosting the fee award on\n\nthat basis is not proper, the judgment of the district court will have to be vacated\n\nand the case remanded. On remand the enhancement will have to be set aside\n\nentirely or at least substantially reduced because without that basis the $4.5\n\nmillion increase above the lodestar amount of reasonable fees cannot stand.\n\n\n                                          39\n\f      This case presents the superior performance and exceptional results\n\nenhancement issue as well as any ever will because the evidence and findings in\n\nthis case are as specific as any are likely to be. It is true that the evidence that the\n\nattorneys put into the record in this case was in the form of affidavits from friendly\n\nlawyers with a vested interest in boosting the award, and for that and other reasons\n\nI did not find it particularly convincing. See id. at 1231–33 (Carnes, J.,\n\nconcurring). But the district court and at least one panel member did. See id., 532\n\nF.3d at 1247–49 (Wilson, J., concurring); see Kenny A., 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1290.\n\nMore importantly for present purposes, the evidence in this case goes beyond that\n\nin the Blum and Delaware Valley cases, and given the nature of the question it is\n\nhard to imagine any more specific supporting evidence than is in the record here.\n\n      And the supporting findings by the district court were probably as specific\n\nas any could be, to say nothing of the enthusiasm with which they were uttered.\n\nSee Kenny A., 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1288–90. The district court unequivocally\n\nproclaimed that the attorneys being awarded fees “brought a higher degree of skill,\n\ncommitment, dedication, and professionalism to this litigation than the Court has\n\nseen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the bench.”\n\nId. at 1289. To convey its feelings about the result obtained, the court reached\n\nback beyond its 27 years on the bench, stating that “[a]fter 58 years as a practicing\n\n\n                                           40\n\fattorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a\n\nplaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a comprehensive\n\nscale.” Id. at 1290.\n\n       In fact, the district court speculated, the results the attorneys were able to\n\nachieve through settlement probably exceeded what their clients were entitled to\n\nreceive under the law. Id. at 1289–90 (“[E]ven if plaintiffs had prevailed in a trial\n\nof this case, it is doubtful that they would have obtained relief as ‘intricately\n\ndetailed and comprehensive’ as that contained in the Consent Decree.”); see also\n\nKenny A., 532 F.3d at 1229–30 (Carnes, J., concurring) (explaining that “[t]o the\n\nextent that the district court rewarded plaintiffs’ counsel with an enhancement for\n\nobtaining better results than the class would have received had the case been\n\nresolved on the merits, that is plainly wrong,” because “the fee-shifting statutes are\n\nnot designed to provide representation that will win plaintiffs more than a correct\n\napplication of substantive and remedial law entitles them to receive”). The district\n\ncourt’s statement highlights the exceptional results issue.3\n\n       3\n          The issue is also highlighted by the fact that the district court calculated the lodestar\nusing the full hourly rates the plaintiffs requested, ranging from $75 to $150 for paralegals,\ninterns, and assistants up to from $215 to $495 for the attorneys depending on “skill, judgment,\nand performance.” See Kenny A., 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1284–85; See also Kenny A., 532 F.3d at\n1217 (majority opinion). “[T]hose hourly rates . . . appear to be on the generous side,” id. at\n1220 n.2., but the district court did not cut them by so much as a penny.\n\n       In approving in full the hourly rates that the plaintiffs requested, the district court\nexpressly relied on “the stellar performance of plaintiffs’ counsel throughout this long and\n\n                                                 41\n\f       It may be that the evidence and findings in this case are insufficient to\n\nsupport a superior performance and exceptional results enhancement. If so, it\n\nlikely will be because no evidence or findings can ever justify an enhancement on\n\nperformance and results grounds because the lodestar already takes into account\n\nall of the factors that go into how well an attorney performs and the result\n\nobtained. The decisions in Dague and Delaware Valley imply as much. See\n\nDague, 505 U.S. at 562–63, 112 S. Ct. at 2641–42; Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at\n\n565–66, 106 S. Ct. at 3098–99. If that is the law, the Supreme Court needs to tell\n\nthose of us on the lower courts because that point has not gotten across. See, e.g.,\n\nKenny A., 532 F.3d at 1243–45 (Wilson, J., concurring); Geier, 372 F.3d at\n\n794–95; see also Norman, 836 F.2d at 1302; NAACP, 812 F.2d at 1336–37; see\n\ngenerally Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1239 n.29 (Carnes, J., concurring).\n\n       The importance of the lodestar question presented by this case extends\n\nbeyond the particular statute involved in this case. It arises not only under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988, as significant as that statute is, but also under every other federal\n\n\ndifficult case,” Kenny A., 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1286. That admission perfectly frames the question\nof whether the Supreme Court meant what it said in Delaware Valley about “the novelty and\ncomplexity of the issues, the special skill and experience of counsel, the quality of representation,\nand the results obtained from the litigation [being] presumably fully reflected in the lodestar\namount, and thus [those factors] cannot serve as independent bases for increasing the basic fee\naward.” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 565, 106 S. Ct. at 3098 (quotation marks omitted, brackets\nomitted and added). The district court plainly counted “the stellar performance of plaintiffs'\ncounsel” twice—once in setting the high hourly rates and again in enhancing the lodestar after\nusing those hourly rates to calculate it. Kenny A., 454 F. Supp. 2d at 1286, 1288-89.\n\n                                                 42\n\ffee-shifting statute that allows the prevailing party to recover a reasonable\n\nattorney’s fee. While these statutes “cover a wide variety of contexts and causes\n\nof action, the benchmark for the awards under nearly all of these statutes is that the\n\nattorney’s fee must be ‘reasonable.’” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 562, 106 S.\n\nCt. at 3096–97. And “case law construing what is a ‘reasonable’ fee applies\n\nuniformly to all of [the federal fee-shifting statutes].” Dague, 505 U.S. at 562, 112\n\nS. Ct. at 2641; see also Indep. Fed’n of Flight Attendants v. Zipes, 491 U.S. 754,\n\n758 n.2, 109 S. Ct. 2732, 2735 n.2 (1989) (“[F]ee-shifting statutes’ similar\n\nlanguage is ‘a strong indication’ that they are to be interpreted alike.” (citation\n\nomitted)); Blum, 465 U.S. at 893, 104 S. Ct. at 1546 (noting that “Congress\n\ndirected that attorney’s fees [under § 1988] be calculated according to standards\n\ncurrently in use under other fee-shifting statutes”); Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club,\n\n463 U.S. 680, 691, 103 S. Ct. 3274, 3281 (1983) (explaining “that similar\n\nattorney’s fee provisions should be interpreted pari passu”); Northcross v. Bd. of\n\nEduc. of Memphis City Schs., 412 U.S. 427, 428, 93 S. Ct. 2201, 2202 (1973)\n\n(noting that “[t]he similarity of language” in two fee-shifting statutes “is, of\n\ncourse, a strong indication that the two statutes should be interpreted pari passu”).\n\n      At a minimum, there are “over 100 separate [federal] statutes providing for\n\nthe award of attorney’s fees.” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 562, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n\n                                          43\n\f3096. The actual number may be higher. See John F. Vargo, The American Rule\n\non Attorney Fee Allocation: The Injured Person’s Access to Justice, 42 Am. U. L.\n\nRev. 1567, 1588 (1993) (noting that “[t]here are over 200 federal statutes . . . that\n\nprovide for shifting of attorney’s fees”); Marjorie A. Silver, Evening the Odds:\n\nThe Case for Attorneys’ Fee Awards for Administrative Resolution of Title VI and\n\nTitle VII Disputes, 67 N.C. L. Rev. 379, 386 n.47 (1989) (estimating that\n\n“Congress has enacted anywhere from 100 to 200 fee-shifting statutes” (internal\n\ncitations omitted)). A partial list of federal fee-shifting statutes is attached as an\n\nappendix to this opinion. The precise number of federal “reasonable attorney’s\n\nfee” statutes is not the point. The point is that this issue arises under not just one\n\nfederal statute but under at least a hundred of them.\n\n      An unresolved issue affecting so many federal statutes is important. The\n\nrecord in this case and the facts and findings drawn from it present this important,\n\nunresolved issue as well as any case will and better than almost any other case can.\n\nIt presents an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reach the issue it could not\n\nreach in Blum and Delaware Valley: Under the federal fee-shifting statutes can a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee be enhanced based on extraordinary effort or results\n\nwhere some evidence and findings support the enhancement, or are all of the\n\nfactors that lead to the quality of the performance and the results obtained already\n\n\n                                           44\n\fcovered in the lodestar calculation, as the opinions in Delaware Valley and Dague\n\nimply?\n\n\n\n\n                                       45\n\f                                   APPENDIX\n\n        Partial List of Federal Statutes Providing for the Prevailing Party\n                    To Recover a Reasonable Attorney’s Fee\n\n\nFreedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(E);\n\nPrivacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(g)(2)(B) & (g)(4)(B);\n\nGovernment in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552b(i);\n\nCommodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. § 18(d)(1) & (e);\n\nPackers and Stockyards Act, 7 U.S.C. § 210(f);\n\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act 1930, 7 U.S.C. § 499g(b);

Blum, 465 U.S. at 899,\n\n104 S. Ct. at 1549. That is not the case here. In Blum, the Court indicated that the\n\noutcome would have been different had the plaintiff’s attorneys “offer[ed] specific\n\n\n                                          3\n\fevidence” to demonstrate that an enhancement was necessary to reflect counsel’s\n\nperformance. Id. I find no language in Blum that can be interpreted to suggest\n\nthat upward adjustments for excellent results or superior performance are\n\ncategorically excluded. The Court stated that an upward adjustment may be\n\njustified in the “rare case where the fee applicant offers specific evidence to show\n\nthat the quality of service rendered was superior to that one reasonably should\n\nexpect in light of the hourly rates charged” and resulted in “exceptional” success.\n\nId.\n\n      Delaware Valley I presented the Supreme Court with a clear opportunity to\n\noverrule Blum, but it did not expressly do so. Rather, the Court repeatedly cited\n\nBlum with approval. See Delaware Valley I, 478 U.S. at 564, 106 S. Ct. at 3098\n\n(“We further refined our views [regarding the proper manner in which to\n\ndetermine a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee] in Blum . . . f[inding] that [the lodestar] is\n\npresumed to be the reasonable fee . . . .”); id. at 568, 106 S. Ct. at 3100 (quoting\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 897, 104 S. Ct. at 1549) (leaving questions left open in Blum to\n\nbe decided later). Additionally, the Supreme Court in Delaware Valley I echoed\n\nBlum’s non-categorical language and conducted a case-specific analysis of the\n\nenhancement at issue. See id. at 566-68, 106 S. Ct. at 3099-3100.\n\n      Moreover, the Supreme Court affirmed in Delaware Valley I that “upward\n\n\n                                           4\n\fadjustments of the lodestar figure are still permissible . . . in certain ‘rare’ and\n\n‘exceptional’ cases, supported by both ‘specific evidence’ on the record and\n\ndetailed findings by the lower courts.” Id. at 565, 106 S. Ct. at 3098 (quoting\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 898-901, 104 S. Ct. at 1548-50). See The Supreme Court, 1986\n\nTerm: Leading Cases, 101 HARV. L. REV. 270, 293 (1987) (concluding that the\n\nDelaware Valley I Court “rejected the use of an enhancement based on superior\n\nattorney performance . . . absent specific evidence that the lodestar did not provide\n\na reasonable award that reflected the quality of representation”). The dissents\n\nmischaracterize Delaware Valley I by ignoring this language, which precedes the\n\nCourt’s holding that “the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant\n\nfactors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance\n\nthe fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling\n\nplaintiffs to secure legal assistance.” Id. at 566, 106 S. Ct. at 3098. Although the\n\nCourt is clear that “the overall quality of performance ordinarily should not be\n\nused to adjust the lodestar,” the Court leaves open the possibility of an\n\nextraordinary case. Id. at 566, 106 S. Ct. at 3099 (emphasis added). Reading\n\nBlum and Delaware Valley I together, the Supreme Court has consistently\n\nindicated that, in the “rare” and “exceptional” case, the district court has the\n\ndiscretion to grant an enhancement.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f      Importantly, there is no circuit split on this issue. The Second, Fourth,\n\nFifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits – all of the circuits that\n\nhave considered this issue – agree that a district court may provide an\n\nenhancement for exceptional performance.

The district judge has an unparalleled opportunity\n\nto observe the attorney’s performance in a given case. Only the district judge can\n\nevaluate the attorney’s performance from the day he or she files the complaint to\n\nthe day the judge enters the order.

On\n\nappeal, the panel accepted the judge’s statements as probative evidence of the\n\n        1\n           Plaintiffs’ amended complaint, the pleading that contained all of the claims for relief,\ncontained 18 counts, 15 of which stated causes of action. Nine of the counts sought relief under\nthe Georgia constitution, Georgia statutes, or common law. Six of the counts sought relief under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the United States Constitution or federal statutes. Section\n1988 applied only to those six counts. The consent decree the court signed does not indicate\nwhether the decree was based on state or federal law. I assume that it was based on one or more\nof the § 1983 counts. In granting plaintiffs attorney’s fees under § 1988, neither the parties nor\nthe court appeared to have segregated out the time plaintiffs’ counsel spent litigating the state law\ncauses of action. Rather, they assumed that all of the time for which plaintiffs’ counsel asked to\nbe compensated dealt with the § 1983 claims. In extolling counsel’s performance as far superior\nto anything he had witnessed in his 27 years on the district court, the district judge did not\ncomment on, and apparently did not take account of, counsel’s performance in prosecuting\nplaintiffs’ state law claims.\n        2\n           It is clear from a reading of the district judge’s order granting plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees\nrequest that the district judge served as plaintiffs’ witness.

In my view, neither NAACP nor Norman compelled the result the\n\npanel reached, nor, as Judge Carnes’s panel opinion argues, should they have.\n\n       I dissent from the court’s failure to take this case en banc. In light of the\n\nnumerous fee-shifting statutes that Judge Carnes has cited in the appendix to his\n\ndissenting opinion, the panel’s reading of NAACP and Norman, which I believe\n\ngoes beyond the cases’ holdings, will control the litigation of attorney’s fees issues\n\nin this circuit. But there are reasons other than the panel’s reading of NAACP and\n\nNorman that require the full court’s attention en banc – reasons independent of\n\nthose Judge Carnes advances.\n\n       3\n          Judge Carnes authored the panel’s majority opinion; however, part VI of the opinion,\n532 F.3d at 1220-42, which addressed the district court’s fee enhancement, represented his views\nalone.

Judge Hill,\nwho joined the remainder of Judge Carnes’s opinion, voted to affirm the fee enhancement solely\n“because we are bound” by NAACP and Norman. Id. at 1251 (Hill, J., concurring). None of the\nthree panel opinions referred to the district judge’s statements as testimony given ex parte and\nwithout notice or questioned whether those statements were unreviewable. Yet the panel\nnecessarily accepted the statements as probative evidence; otherwise, the panel could not have\nreached the result it did.\n\n                                              11\n\f      If my reading of NAACP and Norman, as set out in part I, is correct, the\n\ndistrict court’s decision should be vacated and the case remanded to the district\n\ncourt. I would vacate the court’s decision on two independent grounds: (1) the\n\ndecision is unreviewable; and (2) the manner in which the court used its own\n\ntestimony to enhance plaintiffs’ attorney’s fees request denied the defendants due\n\nprocess of law.\n\n      If my reading of NAACP and Norman is wrong, and their holdings required\n\nthe panel to affirm, en banc review is still necessary to determine whether – in a\n\ncase seeking the sort of injunctive relief plaintiffs sought and obtained in this case\n\n– quality of performance and the result obtained are permissible grounds for\n\nenhancing a lodestar fee that already incorporates an hourly rate at the top of the\n\nrelevant market for the type of services performed. I contend in part III that an\n\nenhancement on these grounds is not available in cases like the one before us.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      In NAACP, we vacated and remanded the district court’s decision refusing\n\nto grant an attorney’s fee enhancement. We did so due to ambiguities in the\n\ndistrict court’s stated bases for denying the enhancement and the court’s failure to\n\naddress plaintiffs’ “exceptional success” justification for a fee enhancement.\n\nNAACP, 812 F.2d at 1336-37. In Norman, we reversed and remanded the district\n\n\n                                          12\n\fcourt’s refusal to enhance the attorney’s fee award because the court used the\n\nwrong standard in assessing the significance of the results the plaintiffs had\n\nobtained. Norman, 836 F.2d at 1306.\n\n      While we did assume in those cases that, at least theoretically, “superior\n\nresults coupled with superior performance can be the basis for an enhancement of\n\nthe lodestar amount,” Kenny A. IV, 532 F.3d at 1238 (emphasis added), in neither\n\ncase did we hold that fee enhancements granted on those grounds must be\n\naffirmed. We certainly did not hold that a district court would not be abusing its\n\ndiscretion if it enhanced an attorney’s fee award on the basis of exceptional\n\nperformance or result, particularly where, as here, the court relied almost\n\nexclusively on unidentified and unreviewable personal experience, rather than\n\nspecific evidence in the record, in reaching its determination.

If, as Judge Carnes’s panel opinion “readily”\n\nconcluded, “the district court’s award of a $4,500,000 enhancement to the lodestar\n\namount in this case is an abuse of discretion,” then NAACP and Norman present\n\nno impediment to vacating the fee award. Kenny A.

For this reason alone, we should hear this case en banc to clarify\n\nand limit the reach of NAACP and Norman so that future courts will not\n\nmistakenly find their precedential effect so constraining.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       If my reading of NAACP and Norman is correct, the district court’s decision\n\nshould be vacated and the case remanded to the district court. As I explain in\n\nsubparts A and B, the decision is unreviewable and is the product of the denial of\n\ndue process of law.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       The district court’s decision to enhance the lodestar in this case through the\n\nuse of a multiplier of 1.75 ultimately was driven by the court’s personal\n\nexperience and subjective relative assessment of the lawyers’ performance.4\n\n\n       4\n         The district court also purported to rely on the following factors as evidence that the\nlodestar calculation failed to account for the quality of service rendered by plaintiffs’ counsel: (1)\nthat counsel were required to advance case expenses of $1.7 million with no ongoing\nreimbursement; (2) that counsel were not paid on an ongoing basis as the work was performed;\n\n                                                 14\n\fSpecifically,\n\n       based on its personal observation of plaintiffs’ counsel’s performance\n       throughout this litigation, the Court [found] that the superb quality of\n       their representation far exceeded what could reasonably be expected\n       for the standard hourly rates used to calculate the lodestar. Quite\n       simply, plaintiffs’ counsel brought a higher degree of skill,\n       commitment, dedication, and professionalism to this litigation than\n       the Court has seen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during\n       its 27 years on the bench.5\n\nKenny A.

This leaves the district court’s personal\nviews of plaintiffs’ counsel’s performance and the result plaintiffs obtained as the only remaining\nbases for the enhancement. Id. at 1228-29.\n       5\n          The district court’s lodestar enhancement surely cannot stand to the extent that it was\nbased on counsel’s “commitment, dedication, and professionalism” displayed in the litigation.\nThese attributes are always required of officers of the court, and attorneys should never be\ncompensated – let alone compensated extra – merely for comporting themselves in a manner\nexpected of all members of the bar, regardless of the fee charged for their services. See, e.g., Ga.\nState Bar R. & Regs., Rule 4-102, Rules of Prof’l Conduct, Preamble & Rules 1.1 (Competence),\n1.3 (Diligence), 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions), 3.2 (Expediting Litigation), 3.3\n(Candor Toward the Tribunal), 3.4 (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel), 3.5 (Impartiality\nand Decorum of the Tribunal); see also LR 83.1(C), NDGa (“All lawyers practicing before this\ncourt shall be governed by and shall comply with the specific rules of practice adopted by this\ncourt and, unless otherwise provided, with the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct\ncontained in the Rules and Regulations of the State Bar of Georgia and with the decisions\nof this court interpreting these rules and standards.”).\n\n                                                15\n\fcalculation.” Id. at 1288. The court further opined “that plaintiffs’ success in this\n\ncase was truly exceptional.” Id. at 1289. Indeed, the court continued, “[a]fter 58\n\nyears as a practicing attorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other\n\ncase in which a plaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a\n\ncomprehensive scale.” Id. at 1290.\n\n      The district judge arrived at the fee enhancement by comparing counsel’s\n\nperformance and the result obtained in this case with the attorneys’ performance\n\nand the result plaintiffs obtained in other cases. The court did not identify the\n\nother cases, the comparators, but I assume that they were cases over which the\n\ndistrict judge presided and that they were class actions in which the plaintiffs\n\nsought equitable relief as sweeping, or nearly so, as what plaintiffs sought in this\n\ncase. Indulging this assumption, the judge’s statements regarding the quality of\n\ncounsel’s representation and the result plaintiffs achieved invite a multitude of\n\nquestions, none of which the judge answered, including:\n\n      •      What quality of representation would “consumers of legal services in\n\n             the legal marketplace in Atlanta” have expected to receive for the\n\n             rates used in the lodestar the district judge fixed in this case?\n\n      •      What cases was the district judge using as comparators? Were they\n\n             cases in which the attorneys claimed a far lower fee? (If so, counsel\n\n\n                                          16\n\f               in this case should have been expected to bring “a higher degree of\n\n               skill” to their task in order to earn the higher requested hourly rate.)\n\n       •       What definition of “success” did the court use?\n\n       •       What level of success did plaintiffs’ counsel achieve in the\n\n               comparators? Assuming that the level of success they achieved was\n\n               lower than what counsel achieved in this case, why was it so?\n\n       The district judge provided no clue as to the answers to these questions.\n\nAccordingly, the critical portions of the record for review – the specific\n\nevidentiary facts on which the decision turned – do not exist. It is well-established\n\nthat “no enhancement is permissible unless there is specific evidence in the record\n\nto show that the quality of representation was superior to that which one would\n\nreasonably expect in light of the rates claimed.” Norman, 836 F.2d at 1302 (citing\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 899, 104 S. Ct. at 1549) (emphasis added). A district judge’s\n\nmental impressions that are based on unknown facts cannot be reviewed.6\n\n                                                 B.\n\n       6\n          While we have previously suggested that a district judge may base a fee enhancement\ndecision on his own knowledge and experience, see Norman, 836 F.2d at 1303, this option, even\nif properly available, does not relieve the judge of the obligation of identifying on the record the\nspecific facts supporting the enhancement decision, see Blum, 465 U.S. at 899, 104 S. Ct. at\n1549 (requiring \"specific evidence\" to support an enhancement based on superior service and\nexceptional success). Here, the district judge relied only on generalized, conclusory findings,\nkeeping the factual premises of those findings locked away inside his personal recollection,\nshielded from challenge or appellate review. Such conclusions are insufficient to support an\nenhancement.\n\n                                                 17\n\f       The district judge provided the critical evidence that plaintiffs needed to\n\nobtain an enhancement of the lodestar that they proposed and that the court\n\naccepted as full compensation for services rendered. The evidence was\n\ntestimonial and was given ex parte and without notice to the defendants.7 In\n\narriving at his fee-award decision in this manner, the judge denied defendants\n\nfundamental due process of law. “[I]t is not proper to admit ex parte evidence,\n\ngiven by witnesses not under oath and not subject to cross-examination by the\n\nopposing party.” Hornsby v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"262902\"><a href=\"/opinion/262902/mrs-lola-hornsby-v-ivan-allen-mayor-of-the-city-of-atlanta/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (5th Cir. 1964).8 The\n\ndistrict judge was required to afford defendants the right of cross-examination and,\n\ndepending on what cross-examination might disclose, an opportunity to put on\n\n\n       7\n           I have not overlooked the possibility that the district judge, in comparing the quality of\ncounsel’s performance and the result plaintiffs attained with the quality of attorney performance\nand the result attained in the comparator cases, was effectively taking judicial notice of the\nquality of performance and result in those other cases. If that is what the judge was doing, it is\nno less troubling than his ex parte testimony is.\n        First, “[a] judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is\neither (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of\naccurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be\nquestioned.” Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). Clearly, the issues here are subject to reasonable dispute, and\nthe accuracy of the court’s determination of the relative merits of plaintiffs’ counsel’s\nperformance and the result as compared to other cases can be, and have been, questioned.\nSecond, the district judge afforded the defendants no opportunity to be heard, as required by Fed.\nR. Evid. 201(e), “as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the tenor of the matter noticed.”\nIn sum, not only were the facts of which the judge may have taken judicial notice not proper\nsubjects of such notice, but the court denied the defendants the procedural protections guaranteed\nby the rules of evidence.\n       8\n        In Bonner v. City of Prichard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"396175\"><a href=\"/opinion/396175/larry-bonner-v-city-of-prichard-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) (en banc), this court\nadopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to\nOctober 1, 1981.\n\n                                                  18\n\frebutting evidence.9 It is obvious to me that the district judge failed to\n\ncomprehend the due process implications of what he was doing. Had he been\n\naware of those implications, he would have been faced with two choices: he could\n\n(1) announce his intent to testify as a plaintiff’s witness; or (2) put aside his\n\npersonal opinion of counsel’s performance and the result attained and, instead,\n\npoint to other specific evidence in the record as the bases for his attorney’s fees\n\ndecision.\n\n       The first choice would have required his recusal from the case. When a\n\n       9\n           In theory, defendants could have exercised their right of cross-examination had they\nmoved the court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59 for a new trial. Rule 59(a)(2) provides,\n        Further Action After a Nonjury Trial. After a nonjury trial, the court may, on\n        motion for a new trial, open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional\n        testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new ones, and\n        direct the entry of a new judgment.\nAn attorney’s fee hearing under a fee shifting statute is essentially a nonjury trial limited to the\nissue of fees. Therefore, Rule 59(a)(2) provides a mechanism by which a defendant, ambushed\nby previously-undisclosed judicial testimony in the dispositive fee order, could obtain a re-\nopening of the proceedings in order to cross-examine the new witness (the judge), introduce\nrebuttal evidence if necessary, and obtain new findings of fact and conclusions of law on the\nbasis of a record so augmented. If the judge granted the Rule 59(a)(2) motion, the defendant\nwould no doubt follow with a motion for recusal unless the judge recused sua sponte. Whether a\ndefendant in a case such as the one at hand must resort to Rule 59(a)(2) relief in order to preserve\nits argument that the court’s utilization of its own ex parte testimony, given without notice,\noperated as a denial of due process is open to question. I would answer the question in the\nnegative for two reasons: (1) a motion for a new trial is not a prerequisite for the direct appeal of\nthe attorney’s fees decision; therefore, such a motion is not necessary to preserve the due process\nissue this case presents; and (2) the scenario associated with processing the new trial motion\nwould likely be unpleasant. In this case, defendants have not asserted the denial of due process\nas a basis for disturbing the district court’s attorney’s fees decision. The issue is, however,\ninextricably intertwined with the question of whether the court’s decision is unreviewable for the\nreasons I have posited, and defendants were not required to assert in their principal brief that the\ndecision under review is unreviewable. Unreviewability is a matter the court of appeals notices\non its own initiative.\n\n                                                 19\n\fjudge becomes a material witness in a case over which he is presiding, he must\n\nrecuse and let another judge take over. The judicial disqualification statute\n\nprovides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\n       (a) Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall\n       disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might\n       reasonably be questioned.\n       (b) He shall also disqualify himself in the following circumstances:\n             (1) Where he has a personal bias or prejudice\n             concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed\n             evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding;\n\n28 U.S.C. § 455(a), (b)(1). Where, as here, the district judge feels compelled to\n\ntestify – here as a plaintiff’s witness – to his personal knowledge and experience,\n\nthe judge clearly has, and has chosen to offer, “personal knowledge of disputed\n\nevidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.” Id. § 455(b)(1). Whether, in\n\naddition, the judge actually has a personal bias or prejudice in favor of the party\n\nwhom his testimony benefits is less clear, although the judge’s opinion here is\n\nreplete with unrestrained and glowing praise for plaintiffs’ counsel, suggesting a\n\ndistinct possibility of such bias or prejudice. But, by testifying on behalf of a\n\nparty, there is little doubt that, at a minimum, the judge’s impartiality might\n\nreasonably be questioned. Id. § 455(a). In such a circumstance, the need for\n\nrecusal is clear.\n\n                                           III.\n\n\n                                           20\n\f       In this part, I assume that my reading of NAACP and Norman is wrong and\n\nthat their holdings required the panel to affirm the enhancement of the lodestar by\n\na multiple of 1.75. En banc review would still be necessary to explore the\n\nproposition that quality of performance and result may be employed in a class\n\naction brought under Rule 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to\n\nenhance a lodestar already reflecting an hourly rate prevailing at the top of the\n\nrelevant market. I contend that neither factor would be an appropriate basis for an\n\nenhancement. I consider first the result reached, then the quality of performance.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Aside from the procedural deficiencies associated with the lodestar\n\nenhancement in this case, it appears to me that an attorney’s fee enhancement\n\nbased on “exceptional” or “superior” results can never be appropriate in a class\n\naction, like this one, in which plaintiffs sought sweeping equitable relief.10\n\nAssuming that a court sitting in equity properly discharges its function in entering\n\na just and legally appropriate injunction, whether following a bench trial or after\n\n\n       10\n           Comparing class actions seeking equitable relief, as in this case, with class actions\nseeking money damages is like comparing apples and oranges. In granting equitable relief, the\ndistrict court is concerned with whether the injunction it enters is narrowly tailored to provide\nonly such relief as is necessary to prevent the future repetition of the legal wrong the court has\nfound and whether the injunction is enforceable through the court’s contempt power. In\napproving the settlement of a damages action, the court is not faced with those concerns. Rather,\nits concern is with the fairness of the settlement to all parties. In a money damages case, once the\nsettlement is approved, the court is no longer involved.\n\n                                                21\n\fconsideration of a consent decree crafted by the parties, there can be but one\n\nqualitative result; in no such case can one result be any more “exceptional” than,\n\nor “superior” to, another.\n\n      In any case in equity, such as the Rule 23(b)(2) class action at hand, the\n\njudge, sitting as a chancellor, has an obligation to do justice under the\n\ncircumstances. See Coral Springs Street Sys., Inc. v. City of Sunrise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76638\"><a href=\"/opinion/76638/coral-springs-street-systems-v-city-of-sunrise/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1340 (11th Cir. 2004) (“It is a bedrock principle of courts of equity that they\n\nmay impose the substantive remedy of injunctive relief only when fundamental\n\nfairness and justice demand it.” (emphasis in original)). The court can reach its\n\njudgment in one of two ways. It can hold a nonjury trial, in which case the court\n\nhas all of the evidence before it and the opportunity to engage the witnesses and\n\nthe attorneys in an effort to muster the information necessary to fashion an\n\nappropriate injunction. Alternatively, the court can enter a consent decree, in\n\nwhich case it must rely heavily on the competence of counsel to craft a legally\n\nappropriate injunction.\n\n      Under either approach – a bench trial or a consent decree – the court’s\n\nobligation is the same. First, the final judgment must be fair and just under the\n\ncircumstances. Second, because the decree will be enforced through the court’s\n\ncivil contempt power, the decree’s injunctive provisions must be enforceable,\n\n\n                                          22\n\fmeaning capable of feasible enforcement. To the extent they are not, the\n\nprovisions should not be entered, as the issuance of an injunctive order that cannot\n\nbe enforced breeds disrespect for the rule of law. Thus, in considering whether to\n\nenter a consent decree, a court must ask itself the same questions it would ask in\n\nassessing the adequacy and propriety of its own order after finding for the\n\nplaintiffs at the end of a bench trial: Are the injunctive provisions to be entered\n\nnot only fair and just under the circumstances, but are they also capable of\n\nenforcement through the court’s civil contempt power? Do they reach only as far\n\nas is necessary to right the wrong, to give the plaintiffs the relief to which they are\n\nlegally entitled but not more? Are they tailored as narrowly as is necessary to\n\neffect the appropriate relief?\n\n        This evaluative rubric will produce one of three qualitative assessments: (1)\n\nthe order will do justice and give the plaintiffs what the law allows; (2) the order\n\nwill give the plaintiffs more relief than the law allows, which is plainly improper;11\n\n\n        11\n           If, in a given case, a proposed consent decree would afford the plaintiffs a level of\nrelief greater than they would be entitled to receive under a decree the court would fashion –\nbecause the consent decree would give the plaintiffs more than the law would allow – the district\ncourt should not approve the decree. In the case before us, the district court indicated that the\nconsent decree may have provided plaintiffs with more than the law would allow. See Kenny A.\nIII, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2317188\"><a href=\"/opinion/2317188/kenny-a-ex-rel-winn-v-perdue/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 1289-90 (“Indeed, the Court has previously recognized that even if\nplaintiffs had prevailed in a trial of this case, it is doubtful that they would have obtained relief as\n‘intricately detailed and comprehensive’ as that contained in the Consent Decree.”); see also\nKenny A. IV, 532 F.3d at 1230 (“To the extent that the district court rewarded plaintiffs’ counsel\nwith an enhancement for obtaining better results than the class would have received had the case\nbeen resolved on the merits, that is plainly wrong. . . . [T]he fee shifting statutes are not designed\n\n                                                  23\n\for (3) the order will provide less relief than the law allows, which would be\n\nunconscionable and unjust. Every entered injunctive order or decree should fall\n\ninto the first category; a court should never enter an order or approve a consent\n\ndecree falling into the second or third category. Accordingly, in any given\n\nequitable case, there can be but one legally proper result.\n\n       In this case, we must assume that the consent decree approved by the district\n\ncourt was prepared by competent counsel on both sides and was crafted to be just\n\nand legally appropriate under the circumstances, affording the plaintiff class no\n\nmore and no less than that to which it was legally entitled. Were this not the case,\n\nthe district court would not – and should not – have approved it. It is against this\n\nnecessary background assumption that we must review whether the result the\n\nconsent decree provided could ever be deemed “exceptional” or “superior” relative\n\nto the result the district court would have fashioned had it tried the case or the\n\nresults reached in other comparable cases. As a matter of law and logic, it cannot.\n\n\nto provide representation that will win plaintiffs more than a correct application of substantive\nand remedial law entitles them to receive. . . . To put it in an either-or manner, superb results are\neither what a fair application of the law produces, which means that they are not truly ‘superb,’ or\nthey are results that exceed what the law allows and for that reason are beyond the purpose of the\nfee-shifting statutes.”). Thus, no fee award, whether or not enhanced beyond an appropriately-\ncalculated lodestar, should ever exceed fair market compensation for obtaining the maximum\nlevel of relief to which the client is legally entitled. Applied to the present context, if any of the\nunidentified comparator cases contemplated by the district court involved (1) receipt by plaintiffs\nof all the relief allowed by law, yet (2) no lodestar enhancement of the attorney’s fees, then the\nlawyers here, who necessarily provided their clients no more “exceptional” a result, should not\ndo any better in terms of fees on the basis of the result obtained in the litigation.\n\n                                                 24\n\f       “Exceptional” has been defined as “constituting, or occurring as, an\n\nexception; not ordinary or average; esp., much above average in quality, ability,\n\netc.” Webster’s New World Dictionary 473 (3d college ed. 1988). “Superior”\n\nmeans “greater in quality or value than . . . above average in quality; excellent.”\n\nId. at 1344. The result in one case can only be deemed “exceptional” or “superior”\n\nin relation to the result the district judge would have fashioned had he tried the\n\ncase to a conclusion or the result he approved or fashioned in an appropriate\n\ncomparator case. A proper comparator case in this situation would be another\n\nRule 23(b)(2) class action seeking equitable relief.12\n\n       However, assuming, as we must, that a comparator case involved an order\n\nor consent decree whose injunctive provisions both (1) were fair and just under the\n\ncircumstances, affording the plaintiffs all the relief to which they were legally\n\nentitled but no more, and (2) were feasibly enforceable, it is hard to see how the\n\nresult in this case could be qualitatively “superior” or “exceptional.” Indeed, were\n\na district court to have found the result in the case before it to be “exceptional” or\n\n“superior” relative to comparator cases, it necessarily would have to conclude that\n\n\n       12\n          The ideal comparators in this case would also involve broad injunctive remedies in\nwhich the court placed numerous affirmative obligations on governmental service bureaucracies.\nHowever, because all injunctive relief, no matter how sweeping or detailed, must meet the same\nequitable criteria and any such case can have but one legally-appropriate result, the inexorable\nconclusion that no properly-crafted injunctive remedy can be any more “exceptional” than or\n“superior” to the next applies regardless of what type of equity case serves as the comparator.\n\n                                              25\n\fthe injunctions in the other cases were unconscionable, unjust, or unenforceable\n\nand, ipso facto, should never have been entered.\n\n      In this case, in which the district judge presumably relied on comparator\n\ncases from his own body of judicial experience, his finding that the result in this\n\ncase was “exceptional” and “superior” enough to justify a fee enhancement\n\nimplicitly denigrates his own prior judgments by suggesting that they failed to\n\nsatisfy the standard for proper equitable relief and that he never should have\n\nentered them. I am unwilling to assume that the district judge erred in deciding\n\nthose prior cases – nor could I reach such a conclusion in any event because, as the\n\ndistrict judge has not disclosed which other cases he was considering, I have no\n\nway to know which decisions to evaluate. Therefore, I have to assume that the\n\ninjunctive relief awarded in the comparator cases was every bit as just, fair, and\n\nenforceable as the relief in this case and, accordingly, no less “exceptional.”\n\n      The upshot is that, in the context of equitable relief, no properly-crafted\n\ninjunction can be more “exceptional” than or “superior” to any other. As such, it\n\ncan never be appropriate to enhance the attorney’s fees in a case seeking\n\ninjunctive relief on the basis of “exceptional” or “superior” results.\n\n                                          B.\n\n      In light of what the Supreme Court has said regarding the proper\n\n\n                                          26\n\fcomposition and function of the lodestar,13 I am convinced that the district court\n\nwas precluded from enhancing the admittedly adequate lodestar on the basis of\n\ncounsel’s performance. “[T]he lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the\n\nrelevant factors constituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and it is unnecessary to\n\nenhance the fee for superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of\n\nenabling plaintiffs to secure legal assistance.” Pennsylvania v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3088</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3098, 92 L.\n\nEd. 2d 439 (1986). The lodestar is normally already assumed to account for the\n\ndifficulty and cost of the case and the performance rendered by the attorney. The\n\nproper way to account for attorney performance is in setting the hourly rate, not in\n\nenhancing the lodestar.\n\n       In the case at hand, however, there is evidence that, in calculating the\n\nlodestar, the district court used hourly rates already at the top of the relevant\n\n\n       13\n           Judge Carnes’s panel opinion canvasses, accurately I believe, the Supreme Court’s\npronouncements about the composition and function of the lodestar. See Kenny A. IV, 532 F.3d\nat 1220-24. In a nutshell, the Court has long advised that the lodestar – the “product of\nreasonable hours times a reasonable rate” – “is presumed to be the reasonable fee contemplated\nby [42 U.S.C. ] § 1988.” Blum, 465 U.S. at 897, 104 S. Ct. at 1548. The Court has further\nemphasized that “[a] strong presumption that the lodestar figure . . . represents a ‘reasonable’ fee\nis wholly consistent with the rationale behind the usual fee-shifting statute.” Del. Valley, 478\nU.S. at 565, 106 S. Ct. at 3098 (emphasis added). In addition, fee shifting statutes “were not\ndesigned as a form of economic relief to improve the financial lot of attorneys . . . . Instead, the\naim of such statutes was to enable private parties to obtain legal help in seeking redress for\ninjuries resulting from the actual or threatened violation of specific federal laws.” Id. In other\nwords, the lodestar is intended to provide full compensation for the legal services rendered, but\nno more than that.\n\n                                                27\n\fmarket for the type and character of legal services performed. Neither the\n\nSupreme Court nor this court has addressed the question of whether a\n\nperformance-based fee enhancement may push the lodestar hourly rate above the\n\nupper end of the prevailing market rate. If it may, then the resulting lodestar\n\nwould yield a fee higher than necessary to serve the purposes of the fee shifting\n\nstatutes – fairly compensating attorneys for the work performed, but only at a rate\n\nhigh enough to ensure their clients’ access to legal services. Therefore, I believe\n\nthat a lodestar hourly rate that is already at the top of the relevant market is simply\n\nineligible for an additional enhancement.\n\n       A fee enhancement might conceivably be appropriate where an attorney\n\nquotes his client an hourly rate at the outset of the case, and later submits that rate\n\nto the court as his reasonable rate, yet that hourly rate ultimately proves to be\n\ninsufficient in light of what the case in fact required the attorney to do.14 Perhaps\n\nin the beginning the attorney did not accurately predict or appreciate how much\n\ntime or effort the case would require, the level of resources he would have to\n\ndevote, or the complexity of the issues that would arise. In short, an attorney who\n\nfinds himself in over his head, stuck with an inadequate hourly rate, may be able to\n\n\n\n       14\n           I assume a case in which the requested hourly rate was somewhere below the top of\nthe relevant market and even the enhanced hourly rate would not exceed an hourly rate prevailing\nat the upper end of the market.\n\n                                              28\n\fwarrant relief in the form of a fee enhancement in order to obtain full and fair\n\ncompensation for the work actually performed.\n\n      The situation is very different, however, when, as should more typically be\n\nthe case, the attorney does not request an hourly rate until the end of the litigation\n\nand the submission of the fee application. At this stage, the attorney already\n\nknows how much time, skill, effort, and expense he has devoted to the case. With\n\nthis knowledge, he is able to determine the combination of hours and hourly rate\n\nthat will compensate him adequately for his services, in light of the results\n\nobtained and the prevailing rates in the relevant market for comparable legal\n\nservices. Attorneys know how to value their own services, and this fully\n\ncompensatory rate is the one that the attorney should request. Having already\n\nincluded every factor properly bearing on compensation – including the degree of\n\nthe attorney’s performance and the results obtained in the litigation – there is no\n\nneed or justification for an enhancement on top of this. Anything over and above\n\nthis fully and fairly compensatory fee, to be candid, could only be the product of\n\nthe attorney’s greed or the judge’s favoritism. Neither ground is, or should be,\n\npermitted under the fee shifting statutes or sanctioned by this court.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n      I conclude where I began. The court ought to rehear this case en banc for\n\n\n                                          29\n\freasons aplenty.\n\n\n\n\n                   30\n\fCARNES, Circuit Judge, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc, in which\nTJOFLAT and DUBINA, Circuit Judges, join:\n\n      Although I have been on the short end of en banc votes before, this is the\n\nfirst time in sixteen years on the bench that I have written, or even joined, a dissent\n\nfrom the denial of rehearing en banc. I take this unusual step to explain why I\n\nbelieve that in this case “a United States court of appeals has decided an important\n\nquestion of federal law that has not been, but should be, settled by [the Supreme]\n\nCourt.” Sup. Ct. R. 10(c).\n\n      The important, unresolved question this case presents is one that affects the\n\nproper application of at least one hundred federal fee-shifting statutes that allow\n\nthe prevailing party to recover a reasonable attorney’s fee from the losing party.\n\nIn arriving at an attorney’s fee award, a district court calculates a lodestar amount\n\nby multiplying the reasonable number of hours worked, which reflects the\n\ndifficulty of the case, by an hourly rate that fully reflects the attorney’s skill and\n\nexperience.

Normally this will\n       encompass all hours reasonably expended on the litigation, and indeed in some\n       cases of exceptional success an enhancement award may be justified.” Hensley,\n       461 U.S., at [435], 103 S. Ct., at 1940. We therefore reject petitioner’s argument\n       that an upward adjustment to an attorney’s fee is never appropriate under § 1988.\n\nBlum, 465 U.S. at 901, 104 S. Ct. at 1550 (footnote omitted). The speculative “may be”\nlanguage is “the purest of dicta,” Santos, 128 S. Ct. at 2801 (plurality opinion), because the\nenhancement in Blum was reversed instead of affirmed. The quote from Hensley is itself the\npurest of dicta because that case involved the reduction of an attorney’s fee award for partial\nsuccess, not the enhancement of one for more success than was expected. Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n426, 103 S.

While I believe that enhancements are never appropriate for superior\nperformance and exceptional results, see Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1220–42 (Carnes, J., concurring),\nthey may well be appropriate in other situations, especially those involving unpopular clients or\ncauses where the attorney suffers from the representation in ways not compensated by the\nlodestar, id. at 1233–34 (giving three examples); see also Guam Soc. of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists v.

The court of appeals had affirmed an enhancement based\n\nin part on the superior quality of the representation and the exceptional nature of\n\nthe success achieved. Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 554–56, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n3093–94. The Supreme Court held that the enhancement was improper. Id. at\n\n567–68, 106 S. Ct. at 3099–3100. In explaining why, the Court made statements\n\nindicating that it was categorically ruling out enhancements for superior\n\nperformance and by extension superior results. See id. at 564–66, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n3098–3100. For example, the Court stated that the special skill and experience of\n\ncounsel, the quality of representation, and the results obtained “are presumably\n\nfully reflected in the lodestar amount, and thus cannot serve as independent bases\n\nfor increasing the basic fee award.” Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at 565, 106 S. Ct.\n\nat 3098. And the Court said this about superior performance enhancements: “In\n\nshort, the lodestar figure includes most, if not all, of the relevant factors\n\nconstituting a ‘reasonable’ attorney’s fee, and it is unnecessary to enhance the fee\n\nfor superior performance in order to serve the statutory purpose of enabling\n\nplaintiffs to secure legal assistance.” Id. at 566, 106 S. Ct. at 3098; see also id. at\n\n\n\nnot prosecuting an unattractive case, but rather pursuing a cause celeb—the type of case that a\nfirm with local roots likely would embrace and seek to publicize to its clients and prospective\nclients as an indication of its community involvement”).\n\n                                               36\n\f566, 106 S. Ct. at 3099 (“[T]he overall quality of performance ordinarily should\n\nnot be used to adjust the lodestar, thus removing any danger of ‘double\n\ncounting’”).\n\n      Those categorical statements are clear, and if the Delaware Valley opinion’s\n\ndiscussion had ended there everyone would agree that this type of enhancement\n\nhad been categorically ruled out. The problem is that the discussion did not end\n\nwith those statements. Instead, there was a “furthermore.” After explaining why\n\nthe quality of the performance or the results obtained cannot serve as bases for\n\nenhancing the fee award, the Court stated that “[f]urthermore” there was neither\n\nspecific evidence nor specific findings in that case about why the results were so\n\noutstanding or why the quality of representation was not fully reflected in the\n\nlodestar. Id. at 567–68, 106 S. Ct. at 3099. And “[i]n the absence of such\n\nevidence and such findings,” the Court could “find no reason to increase the fee\n\naward” based on the quality of representation. Id. at 568, 106 S. Ct. at 3099–3100.\n\n      There are two ways to interpret the Delaware Valley decision and its\n\n“furthermore” discussion. One way is to read the decision as containing two\n\nalternative holdings: an enhancement for superior representation and exceptional\n\nresults is never permitted; and, even if it were, there was insufficient evidence or\n\nfindings of anything special in that case. See Kenny A., 532 F.3d at 1239–41\n\n\n                                         37\n\f(Carnes, J., concurring). The other way is to read Delaware Valley as containing\n\nnot two alternative holdings, but only one, which is that such enhancements are\n\nnot allowed absent specific evidence and findings to support the conclusion that\n\nthe quality of representation and results obtained were truly special. See Kenny\n\nA., 532 F.3d at 1243–45 (Wilson, J., concurring); Geier v. Sundquist, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786642\"><a href=\"/opinion/786642/rita-sanders-geier-patrick-j-gilpin-ernest-terrell-harold-sweatt-phillip/\"><span class=\"volume\">372</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 794–95 (6th Cir. 2004). Under that view, everything before the\n\n“furthermore” in the Delaware Valley opinion is not an alternative holding but\n\nonly dicta.\n\n      If my alternative holdings interpretation of Delaware Valley is correct, then\n\nthe law of this circuit and of the Sixth Circuit is flatly contrary to Supreme Court\n\nprecedent, which needs to be clarified so that it will no longer be misinterpreted as\n\nholding exactly the opposite of what it does. If, instead, the narrow interpretation\n\nof the Delaware Valley decision is correct, then the Supreme Court has yet to\n\nhold—not imply, intimate, or suggest in dicta but actually hold—whether the\n\nfederal fee-shifting statutes allow an enhancement when there is specific evidence\n\nand findings of superior performance and unexpected results.\n\n      The issue is clearly and squarely presented in this case. Two of the panel\n\nmembers in this case sharply disagreed and wrote about the meaning and effect of\n\nthe Blum and Delaware Valley decisions, both of which reversed instead of\n\n\n                                         38\n\faffirmed enhancements for superior performance and results. Those two panel\n\nmembers also disagreed about the effect on this issue of the reasoning in City of\n\nBurlington v. Dague, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112778\"><a href=\"/opinion/112778/burlington-v-dague/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112778\"><a href=\"/opinion/112778/burlington-v-dague/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Compare Kenny A., 532\n\nF.3d at 1221–33, 1239–41 (Carnes, J., concurring) with id. at 1242–49 (Wilson, J.,\n\nconcurring). The third panel member kept his views about that matter to himself.\n\nSee id. at 1251 (Hill, J., concurring). The bottom line for certiorari review\n\npurposes, however, is that the law of the Eleventh Circuit permits this kind of\n\nenhancement, and that law was applied to permit a $4.5 million enhancement of\n\nthe lodestar amount in this case. See id. at 1236–39, 1242 (Carnes, J.,\n\nconcurring); id. at 1242, 1251 (Wilson, J., concurring); id. at 1251 (Hill, J.,\n\nconcurring).\n\n      The decision whether to affirm or vacate the $4.5 million enhancement part\n\nof the attorney’s fee award turns on whether an enhancement for superior\n\nperformance and exceptional results is permissible. If boosting the fee award on\n\nthat basis is not proper, the judgment of the district court will have to be vacated\n\nand the case remanded. On remand the enhancement will have to be set aside\n\nentirely or at least substantially reduced because without that basis the $4.5\n\nmillion increase above the lodestar amount of reasonable fees cannot stand.\n\n\n                                          39\n\f      This case presents the superior performance and exceptional results\n\nenhancement issue as well as any ever will because the evidence and findings in\n\nthis case are as specific as any are likely to be. It is true that the evidence that the\n\nattorneys put into the record in this case was in the form of affidavits from friendly\n\nlawyers with a vested interest in boosting the award, and for that and other reasons\n\nI did not find it particularly convincing. See id. at 1231–33 (Carnes, J.,\n\nconcurring). But the district court and at least one panel member did. See id., 532\n\nF.3d at 1247–49 (Wilson, J., concurring); see Kenny A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2317188\"><a href=\"/opinion/2317188/kenny-a-ex-rel-winn-v-perdue/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court unequivocally\n\nproclaimed that the attorneys being awarded fees “brought a higher degree of skill,\n\ncommitment, dedication, and professionalism to this litigation than the Court has\n\nseen displayed by the attorneys in any other case during its 27 years on the bench.”\n\nId. at 1289. To convey its feelings about the result obtained, the court reached\n\nback beyond its 27 years on the bench, stating that “[a]fter 58 years as a practicing\n\n\n                                           40\n\fattorney and federal judge, the Court is unaware of any other case in which a\n\nplaintiff class has achieved such a favorable result on such a comprehensive\n\nscale.” Id. at 1290.\n\n       In fact, the district court speculated, the results the attorneys were able to\n\nachieve through settlement probably exceeded what their clients were entitled to\n\nreceive under the law. Id. at 1289–90 (“[E]ven if plaintiffs had prevailed in a trial\n\nof this case, it is doubtful that they would have obtained relief as ‘intricately\n\ndetailed and comprehensive’ as that contained in the Consent Decree.”); see also\n\nKenny A., 532 F.3d at 1229–30 (Carnes, J., concurring) (explaining that “[t]o the\n\nextent that the district court rewarded plaintiffs’ counsel with an enhancement for\n\nobtaining better results than the class would have received had the case been\n\nresolved on the merits, that is plainly wrong,” because “the fee-shifting statutes are\n\nnot designed to provide representation that will win plaintiffs more than a correct\n\napplication of substantive and remedial law entitles them to receive”). The district\n\ncourt’s statement highlights the exceptional results issue.3\n\n       3\n          The issue is also highlighted by the fact that the district court calculated the lodestar\nusing the full hourly rates the plaintiffs requested, ranging from $75 to $150 for paralegals,\ninterns, and assistants up to from $215 to $495 for the attorneys depending on “skill, judgment,\nand performance.” See Kenny A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2317188\"><a href=\"/opinion/2317188/kenny-a-ex-rel-winn-v-perdue/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

If so, it\n\nlikely will be because no evidence or findings can ever justify an enhancement on\n\nperformance and results grounds because the lodestar already takes into account\n\nall of the factors that go into how well an attorney performs and the result\n\nobtained. The decisions in Dague and Delaware Valley imply as much. See\n\nDague, 505 U.S. at 562–63, 112 S. Ct. at 2641–42; Delaware Valley, 478 U.S. at\n\n565–66, 106 S. Ct. at 3098–99. If that is the law, the Supreme Court needs to tell\n\nthose of us on the lower courts because that point has not gotten across.
