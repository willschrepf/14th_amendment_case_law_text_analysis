LONG, LEONARD POLK, ROY SANCHEZ, AND\n                  LONNIE VARA, Appellees\n\n\n\n                 On Appeal from the 234th District Court\n                          Harris County, Texas\n                    Trial Court Case No. 2011-75492\n\f                                   OPINION\n\n      This appeal concerns whether the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nover a suit brought by John Klumb and five other plaintiffs against the Houston\n\nMunicipal Employees Pension System (“HMEPS”) and five members of its board\n\nof trustees. The trial court granted HMEPS’s and the trustees’ plea to the\n\njurisdiction, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims and the claims of the City of Houston,\n\nwhich had intervened in the suit. On appeal, the plaintiffs and the City of Houston\n\ncontend that the trial court erred by granting the plea. They assert that the suit is\n\nnot barred because it arises from the trustees’ ultra vires acts of violating Article\n\n6243h of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes. Plaintiffs also argue that the trial court\n\nhas jurisdiction over the constitutional claims they have raised.\n\n      Because we agree with HMEPS and the trustees that the trial court lacks\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the pleaded claims, we affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      As a defined benefit pension plan, HMEPS provides retirement, disability,\n\nand survivor benefits for eligible City of Houston employees. Article 6243h of the\n\nTexas Revised Civil Statutes established HMEPS. See TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fart. 6243h, §§ 1–28 (Vernon 2010). 1 Pursuant to Article 6243h, an eleven member\n\nBoard of Trustees, or pension board, has broad authority to administer, manage,\n\nand operate HMEPS. See id. art. 6243h, § 2(a).\n\n      With respect to the pension board’s authority, relevant text of Article 6243h,\n\nsection 2, provides as follows:\n\n      (x) The pension board shall manage the pension fund under this Act\n      and under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may:\n\n             (1) adopt, for the administration of the pension fund,\n             written rules and guidelines;\n\n             (2) interpret and construe this Act and any summary plan,\n             descriptions, or benefits procedures, except that each\n             construction must meet any qualification requirements\n             established under Section 401, Internal Revenue Code of\n             1986, as amended;\n\n             (3) correct any defect, supply any omission, and\n             reconcile any inconsistency that appears in this Act in a\n             manner and to the extent that the pension board considers\n             expedient to administer this Act for the greatest benefit of\n             all members;\n\n             (4) determine all questions, whether legal or factual,\n             relating to eligibility for membership, service, or benefits\n             or relating to the administration of the pension fund to\n             promote the uniform administration of the pension fund\n             for the benefit of all members and retirees; and\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Article 6243h applies only to cities with a population of 1.5 million or more. See\n      TEX. REV. STAT. CIV. ANN. art. 6243h, § 1(4) (Vernon 2010). Houston is\n      currently the only city in Texas with a population of more than 1.5 million.\n                                          3\n\f             (5) establish and maintain records necessary or\n             appropriate for the proper administration of the pension\n             fund.\n\n      (y) The determination of any fact by the pension board and the\n      pension board’s interpretation of this Act are final and binding on any\n      interested party, including members, deferred participants, retirees,\n      eligible survivors, beneficiaries, and the city.\n\n      Id. art. 6243h, § 2(x)–(y).\n\nArticle 6243h also provides that the City of Houston (“the City”) must make\n\nperiodic payments to HMEPS based on a percentage of the combined salaries of\n\nthe pension system members, who are active municipal employees. See id. art.\n\n6243h § 8(d); see also id. art. 6243h, § 1(13).\n\n      In July 2011, the City and HMEPS entered into a contract called a “meet and\n\nconfer agreement.” The July 2001 meet and confer agreement (hereinafter, “the\n\nMeet and Confer Agreement”) addressed, inter alia, the amount of contribution the\n\nCity was required to pay HMEPS for the upcoming fiscal year. Over the years, the\n\nCity and HMEPS have entered into a number of meet and confer agreements\n\nregarding various issues.     Such agreements are authorized by Article 6243h,\n\nsection 3(n). Id. art. 6243h, § 3(n).\n\n      The City’s pension obligation relates generally to the amount of its\n\nemployees’ salaries. The City devised a plan to reduce such budgetary obligation\n\nby having non-City employees perform services previously performed by City\n\nemployees.    To this end, the City merged its Convention and Entertainment\n                                          4\n\fFacilities Department with an existing local government corporation, the Houston\n\nConvention Center Hotel Corporation. Effective July 1, 2011, the City entered into\n\nan Interlocal Agreement and Lease Agreement with the Houston Convention\n\nCenter Hotel Corporation to manage various City-owned facilities, such as\n\ntheaters, convention centers, and parking lots.\n\n      Houston Convention Center Hotel Corporation then changed its name to\n\nHouston First Corporation, which assumed the obligations under the agreement\n\nwith the City. The City planned to transition all but 39 of its employees from its\n\nConvention and Entertainment Facilities Department to Houston First Foundation,\n\na newly created non-profit corporation.       The City planned for the employee\n\ntransfer to reduce its total amount of pension obligation based on its position that\n\nthe transferred employees would no longer be HMEPS “members.”\n\n      Article 6243h, section 1(13) defines “member” as follows: “each active\n\nemployee included in the pension system, except for an employee who is ineligible\n\nunder Section 4 of this Act.” Id. art. 6243h, § 1(13). Article 6243h, section 1(11)\n\nprovides:\n\n            “Employee” means any person, including an elected official\n      during the official’s service to the city, who is eligible under this Act\n      and:\n\n            (A) who holds a municipal position or a position with the\n      pension system;\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      (B) whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city or of\n      the pension fund; and\n\n      (C) who is paid a regular salary for services.\n\nId. art. 6243h, § 1(11).\n\n      On August 25, 2011, HMEPS’s pension board had a meeting. The minutes\n\nfrom the meeting reflect that the board passed “a [m]otion to approve the\n\namendments to the HMEPS Pension Plan Document.” The minutes reflect that\n\nfive trustees voted to approve the motion: (1) Barbara Chellette, (2) David L.\n\nLong, (3) Leonard Polk, (4) Roy Sanchez, and (5) Lonnie Vara. Trustee Craig\n\nMason and another board member voted to deny the motion. Two other trustees\n\nwere absent.\n\n      Also on August 25, 2011, the board chair signed the Pension Plan Document\n\n“As Amended and Restated Effective July 1, 2011.” The Pension Plan Document\n\ncontains a number of definitions, including the definition of “employee.” That\n\ndefinition restates the definition of “employee” found in Article 6243h:\n\n      A person who is eligible under the Act and (a) who holds a municipal\n      position or a position with the Pension System; (b) whose name\n      appears on a regular full-time payroll of the City or of the Pension\n      System; and (c) who is paid a regular salary for services. “Employee”\n      includes an elected official during the official’s service to the City, if\n      he is eligible to participate under the terms of the Pension System as it\n      relates to elected officials.\n\nSee id.\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      The pension plan definition, as set out in the Pension Plan Document, further\n\nprovides:\n\n      “Employee” also includes a full-time employee of a Texas local\n      government corporation (“LGC”) controlled by the City, upon a\n      determination by the External Affairs Committee of the Board of\n      Trustees that such LGC’s employees are Employees for purposes of\n      the Plan.\n\n      Before the Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department transferred\n\nany employees to Houston First Foundation, the Board passed and adopted a\n\nresolution on October 6, 2011 (“the Resolution”). The Resolution provides, “[T]he\n\nrequirements for membership in HMEPS are provided under the terms of Article\n\n6243h . . . and the . . . Meet and Confer Agreement dated as of July 2011.” The\n\nResolution further provides, in part, as follows:\n\n      Whereas, the Board of Trustees has previously determined that an\n      “Employee” for purposes of HMEPS includes a full-time employee of\n      Texas local government corporation controlled by the City of Houston\n      (“City”), upon determination by committee of the Board of Trustees\n      consisting of the elected trustees and the trustee appointed by the\n      elected trustees (the “External Affairs Committee”) that such entity’s\n      employees are Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS;\n\n      Whereas, under the interpretations previously adopted by the Board of\n      Trustees, Houston First Corporation and its wholly owned and\n      controlled subsidiary, Houston First Foundation, are controlled by the\n      City, and thus the employees on the payroll of either the Houston First\n      Corporation or the Houston First Foundation are considered\n      Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS;\n\n      Now Therefore Be It Resolved, employees of any entity controlled,\n      directly or indirectly, by the City are considered Employees for\n      purposes of membership in HMEPS, unless the External Affairs\n                                          7\n\f       Committee expressly determines otherwise; provided, however that\n       nothing in this resolution would apply to an individual covered by the\n       Houston Firefighters Relief Retirement Fund or the Houston Police\n       Officers Pension System or any otherwise ineligible employee as\n       determined by the External Affairs Committee . . . .\n\n       On October 24, 2011, Convention and Cultural Services, Inc. (“CCSI”), a\n\nTexas nonprofit corporation, was incorporated. Its articles of incorporation state\n\nthat CCSI was organized for certain purposes, such as supporting “the operation\n\nand maintenance of public assembly facilities and theaters owned by the City of\n\nHouston.”\n\n       An attorney for the City sent a letter to HMEPS, explaining that\n\n“[b]eginning on December 1, 2011, all eligible employees of the Convention and\n\nEntertainment Facilities Department, except for 39 employees who were within\n\nseven years of retirement with HMEPS, would “transition” to CCSI, “which will\n\noperate as an employee leasing company to furnish services to Houston First\n\nCorporation . . . .” The letter continued, “Neither Houston First Corporation nor\n\nHouston First Foundation will have any employees currently employed by\n\n[CCSI] . . . .   Neither the City, the Mayor nor City Council will have any\n\nappointment authority or control over the corporation or its board of directors.”\n\nThe attorney further explained, “[CCSI] will be contracting for its own employee\n\nbenefits, including a 401k plan, and will not participate in any City of Houston\n\nbenefit programs.”\n\n                                         8\n\f      In other words, the City took the position that, beginning December 1, 2011,\n\nall but 39 of the Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department’s employees\n\nwould no longer be City employees; they would be CCSI employees, whose\n\nservices would be leased to Houston First, which would then utilize the CCSI\n\nemployees to manage and operate City facilities. The employees would be doing\n\nthe same job but, according to the City, they would have a different employer and\n\nwould be members of a different pension plan. Thus, the City would no longer be\n\nobligated to make contributions to HMEPS based on those employees’ salaries\n\nbecause they would no longer be City employees.\n\n      HMEPS’s External Affairs Committee met on November 17, 2011.              A\n\nnotation in the meeting minutes indicates that the committee planned to “make\n\ndeterminations regarding Section 3(n) Meet and Confer issues.” The minutes then\n\nindicate that the committee went into a closed session to consider “the documents\n\nregarding the Houston First Corporation and [CCSI].” The minutes show that,\n\nonce back in open session, the External Affairs Committee discussed the\n\ndocuments and passed a motion that “the employees would be in a control group\n\nand that they remain as members of the plan.” The following pension board\n\nmembers were members of the External Affairs Committee: Barbara Chellette,\n\nDavid L. Long, Leonard Polk, Roy Sanchez, and Lonnie Vara.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f      No one disputes that, before November 30, 2011, John Klumb, Veronica\n\nMcClelland, Vivian Montejano, John Gonzalez, Anita Robles, and Charmaine\n\nPilgrim were employees of the City. Before that date, each of these employees\n\nprovided notice to the City that he or she was terminating his or her employment\n\nwith the City at the end of business on November 30.                These employees\n\ntransitioned to CCSI, effective December 1, 2011.               Klumb, McClelland,\n\nMontejano, Gonzalez, Robles, Pilgrim, and the City claimed that, beginning\n\nDecember 1, 2011, these individuals were no longer employees of the City but\n\nwere employees of CCSI.\n\n      Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano each applied to begin receiving\n\nretirement benefits from HMEPS. Under Article 6243h, and as agreed in the Meet\n\nand Confer Agreement, a member of the pension system, who terminates\n\nemployment with the City, is eligible for a normal retirement pension, beginning\n\non the member’s effective retirement date, if the member (1) completes at least\n\nfive years of credit service and attains either 62 years of age or (2) the member is at\n\nleast 50 years old and, when added together, the member’s age and years of\n\ncredited service equal the number 75.          See id. art. 6243h, § 10(b).    Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano each took the position that he or she was eligible to\n\nreceive retirement benefits from HMEPS because he or she had terminated\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\femployment with the City and met one of the retirement criteria of Article 6243h,\n\nsection 10.\n\n      HMEPS disagreed, denying the applications of Klumb, McClelland, and\n\nMontejano for retirement benefits. HMEPS took the position that these individuals\n\nremained municipal employees, despite their transfer to CCSI. HMEPS based its\n\ndecision on the definition of “employee” as found in the July 2011 Pension Plan\n\nDocument.\n\n      Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim did not contend that they were eligible to\n\nreceive retirement benefits from HMEPS after being transferred to CCSI. Rather,\n\nthey asserted that they were entitled to defer their retirement status because they\n\nwere no longer employees of the City. The City also held this position. HMEPS\n\ndisagreed, averring that Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim also remained City\n\nemployees.     HMEPS asserted that these individuals must continue to make\n\nmonthly contributions to HMEPS, and the City must continue to make\n\ncontributions to HMEPS based on their salaries.\n\n      Klumb,     McClelland,      Montejano,      Gonzalez,      Robles,      and   Pilgrim\n\n(collectively, at times, “Plaintiffs”) filed suit against HMEPS, asserting claims for\n\nconstitutional violations and breach of contract.             Plaintiffs also sought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment. 2 They asserted that, by continuing to define them as City\n\n\n2\n      The suit was filed as a class action but was never certified as such.\n                                            11\n\femployees, HMEPS was violating Article 6243h. Plaintiffs also alleged that, by\n\ntreating them as City employees, HMEPS was violating a section of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code. They requested the trial court to declare that they were no longer\n\nCity employees. Plaintiffs also sought monetary damages from HMEPS.\n\n      HMEPS filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action. HMEPS argued\n\nthat Article 6243h does not provide for judicial review of its board’s decisions,\n\nparticularly those decisions based on an interpretation of Article 6243h. It asserted\n\nthat the trial court lacked jurisdiction to review the board’s decision that Plaintiffs\n\nremain city “employees” under Article 6243h. HMEPS also asserted immunity\n\nfrom suit with respect to Plaintiffs’ breach of contract and constitutional claims.\n\n      Plaintiffs filed an amended petition. They sued not only HMEPS, but also\n\nfive members of its board of trustees: (1) Barbara Chellette, (2) David L. Long, (3)\n\nLeonard Polk, (4) Roy Sanchez, and (5) Lonnie Vara (collectively, “the Trustees”).\n\nSeeking declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs alleged that the Trustees had, in\n\ntheir official capacities, committed the following ultra vires acts in violation of\n\nArticle 6243h:\n\n• “[V]oting to approve the motion of August 25, 2011, containing an\n  unauthorized amendment of the statute and the Pension Plan; viz., a\n  unilateral change to the definition of ‘employee’ that is totally\n  inconsistent with the statutory definition contained in Section 1(11) of\n  Article 6243h.” The “change was made in violation of the statutorily-\n\n                                          12\n\f   prescribed procedure set forth in [s]ection 3(n) of Article 6243h for\n   amending the statute and Pension Plan under such circumstances.”\n\n• “[V]oting to adopt the resolution of October 6, 2011 . . . implement[ing]\n  the ultra vires amendment to the Pension Plan that unilaterally changed\n  the statutory definition of ‘employee’ in [s]ection 1(11) of Article\n  6243h.” Included in this ultra vires act was “an illegal determination that\n  Plaintiffs were ‘employees’ under the Pension Plan, as that determination\n  was based on an unauthorized amendment to the Pension Plan that was\n  adopted in violation of [s]ection 3(n) of Article 6243h.”\n\n• “Adopting the October 6, 2011 resolution which purported to authorize\n  an External Affairs Committee to determine who would qualify as an\n  ‘employee’ under the illegal Pension Plan Amendment.”\n\n• “Adopting a construction of Article 6243h and the Pension Plan that fails\n  to meet the qualification requirements of [s]ection 401, Internal Revenue\n  Code of 1986, as amended, as required by [s]ection 2(x) of Article\n  6243h.”\n\n• Refusing to pay Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano their retirement\n  benefits and denying Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim their right to defer\n  their retirement status.\n\n      Plaintiffs requested the trial court to declare that the Trustees (1) “acted\n\nwithout legal authority in approving the motion of August 25, 2011 . . . illegally\n\nchang[ing] the definition of ‘employee’ contained in ection 1(11) of Article 6243h\n\nwithout following the prescribed procedures in Section 3(n) of the statute”; (2)\n\n“acted without legal authority in adopting the resolution of October 6, 2011”; and\n\n(3) “acted without legal authority in determining that Plaintiffs and the members of\n\nthe putative class are ‘employees’ of the City.” Plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the\n\nTrustees from enforcing the alleged ultra vires acts, including a request that the\n\n                                         13\n\ftrial court enjoin “the ultra vires action of adopting an illegal amendment to the\n\nPension Plan that disqualifies the Pension Plan under the Internal Revenue Code.”\n\n      In addition, Plaintiffs asserted constitutional claims against HMEPS.\n\nKlumb, McClelland, and Montejano asserted that they have been denied equal\n\nprotection under the Texas Constitution because HMEPS is treating them\n\ndifferently than it has treated past employees who have left employment with the\n\nCity to work for other legal entities and who are now receiving retirement benefits.\n\nThey also contended that their right to due course of law under the Texas\n\nConstitution has been abridged because they have a right to receive their vested\n\nretirement benefits. All Plaintiffs asserted a due course of law violation, alleging\n\nthat HMEPS’s attempt “to seize” contributions from their salaries is an unlawful\n\ntaking in violation of their due course of law rights.\n\n      The City filed a petition in intervention. It generally echoed Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations that the Trustees had engaged in ultra vires acts in violation of Article\n\n6243h. The City also sought injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n      HMEPS filed an amended plea to the jurisdiction in which the Trustees\n\njoined. They asserted that the claims in the suit emanate from the pension board’s\n\ninterpretation of Article 6243h, specifically its construction of whether Plaintiffs fit\n\nwithin the statutory definition “employee.” HMEPS and the Trustees argued that\n\nthe trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit because the board’s\n\n                                          14\n\finterpretation of Article 6243h, per the statute, is final and binding with no right of\n\njudicial review. HMEPS and the Trustees asserted that the allegations of ultra\n\nvires acts are an attempt to recast claims of statutory misinterpretation solely for\n\nthe purpose of creating jurisdiction.          HMEPS also alleged that Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional claims are barred by sovereign immunity.\n\n      Plaintiffs and the City responded to the plea. After a hearing, the trial court\n\ngranted the plea to the jurisdiction. It rendered judgment dismissing the Plaintiffs’\n\nand the City’s claims for lack of jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, Plaintiffs list ten issues in their brief. Issues one through eight\n\nraise both general and specific challenges to the trial court’s grant of the plea to the\n\njurisdiction. Issue nine addresses the trial court’s evidentiary ruling striking an\n\naffidavit offered by Plaintiffs in support of their response. Issue ten speaks to\n\nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the trial court’s denial of their motion for continuance. In\n\nits brief, the City raises one general issue challenging the trial court’s decision to\n\ngrant the plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n                               Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\nA.    Standard and Scope of Review\n\n      Subject-matter jurisdiction is essential to the authority of a court to decide a\n\ncase. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 443 (Tex. 1993).\n\nThe plaintiff bears the burden of alleging facts affirmatively showing that the trial\n\n                                          15\n\fcourt has subject-matter jurisdiction. Id. at 446. The absence of subject-matter\n\njurisdiction may be raised by a plea to the jurisdiction. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).\n\n      Whether a trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction is a question of law and\n\nis reviewed de novo. See Mayhew v. Town of Sunnyvale, 964 S.W.2d 922, 928\n\n(Tex. 1998). When conducting a de novo review, the appellate court exercises its\n\nown judgment and re-determines each legal issue, giving no deference to the trial\n\ncourt’s decision. Quick v. City of Austin, 7 S.W.3d 109, 116 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, a court may not weigh the merits of the\n\nclaims; it must consider only the plaintiff’s pleadings and the evidence pertinent to\n\nthe jurisdictional inquiry. Cnty. of Cameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555 (Tex.\n\n2002). The court must take the allegations in the petition as true and construe them\n\nin favor of the pleader. See Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133\n\nS.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      When reviewing a trial court’s ruling on a challenge to its jurisdiction, we\n\nconsider the plaintiff’s pleadings and factual assertions, as well as any evidence in\n\nthe record that is relevant to the jurisdictional issue. City of Elsa v. Gonzalez, 325\n\nS.W.3d 622, 625 (Tex. 2010); Bland, 34 S.W.3d at 555. The court must review the\n\nrelevant evidence to determine whether a fact issue exists. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\nat 226. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding the jurisdictional issue,\n\n                                         16\n\fthen the court cannot grant the plea, and the issue must be resolved by the trier of\n\nfact. Id. at 227–28; see Gonzalez, 325 S.W.3d at 626. On the other hand, if the\n\nevidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question, the court must rule on the\n\nplea as a matter of law. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.\n\nB.    Ultra Vires Claims\n\n      In their second, third, and fourth issues, Plaintiffs assert that the trial court\n\nerred by granting the plea to the jurisdiction with respect to their ultra vires claims\n\nrequesting declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs also contend in their ninth\n\nissue that the trial court abused its discretion by striking an affidavit they offered as\n\njurisdictional evidence. The City, in its sole issue, offers arguments aligned with\n\nthose of Plaintiffs with respect to the ultra vires claims.         Thus, for ease of\n\nreference, we refer collectively to the City and Plaintiffs as “Appellants.”\n\n      Appellants contend that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over\n\ntheir ultra vires claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in which they seek to\n\nrequire the Trustees to comply with the provisions of Article 6243h. Appellants\n\ncite City of El Paso v. Heinrich for the proposition that ultra vires suits seeking “to\n\nrequire state officials to comply with statutory or constitutional provisions are not\n\nprohibited by sovereign immunity.” 284 S.W.3d 366, 372 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      The Trustees are critical of Appellants’ reliance on Heinrich. They point out\n\nthat their plea to the jurisdiction did not seek to dismiss Appellants’ claims for\n\n                                           17\n\fdeclaratory and injunctive relief based on sovereign immunity.          Rather, they\n\nasserted that the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because the board of\n\ntrustees has exclusive authority to interpret Article 6243h and to make benefits\n\ndecisions. The Trustees argue that there is no right of judicial review of such\n\ndeterminations.\n\n      In support of their position, the Trustees rely on Houston Municipal\n\nEmployees Pension System v. Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d 151 (Tex. 2007). There, the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas dismissed a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nagainst HMEPS in which the plaintiffs were challenging a benefits decision by the\n\nboard. Id. at 158–59. The plaintiffs asked “the trial court to hold that the statute\n\nrequires the pension board to credit each plaintiff’s retirement account with time\n\nserved . . . and [to hold] that the pension board was violating the law by refusing to\n\ngrant such credit.” Id. at 158. The plaintiffs also “requested that the trial court\n\nissue an injunction directing the pension board to comply with the trial court’s\n\ninterpretation of Article 6243h.” Id. at 158–59.\n\n      In determining whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the claims, the\n\nFerrell court reiterated the well-established precept, “There is no right to judicial\n\nreview of an administrative order unless a statute explicitly provides that right or\n\nthe order violates a constitutional right.” Id. at 158 (citing Gen. Servs. Comm’n v.\n\nLittle–Tex Insulation Co., 39 S.W.3d 591, 599 (Tex. 2001); Cont’l Cas. Ins. Co. v.\n\n                                         18\n\fFunctional Restoration Assocs., 19 S.W.3d 393, 397 (Tex. 2000); Firemen’s &\n\nPolicemen’s Civil Serv. Comm’n v. Kennedy, 514 S.W.2d 237, 239–40 (Tex.\n\n1974); City of Amarillo v. Hancock, 239 S.W.2d 788, 790–92 (Tex. 1951)). The\n\ncourt further explained that “when an act is either silent on the question of appeal\n\nor expressly denies a right to appeal, a party may appeal only ‘where the\n\nadministrative action complained of violates a constitutional provision.’”         Id.\n\n(citing Hancock, 239 S.W.2d at 790).\n\n      The Ferrell court underscored that Article 6243h provides, “The\n\ndetermination of any fact by the pension board and the pension board’s\n\ninterpretation of this Act are final and binding on any interested party.” Id. (citing\n\nTEX. REV.CIV. STAT. art. 6243h, § 2(y)). The court concluded that the relief sought\n\nby the plaintiffs, “whether labeled a declaratory judgment or review of a pension\n\nboard decision, exceeds the power of the trial court as limited by the ‘final and\n\nbinding’ language of Article 6243h.” Id. at 159. The court held, “Because the\n\nLegislature has not authorized the trial court to grant the relief sought, the trial\n\ncourt lacks jurisdiction over the case.” Id.\n\n      The Trustees interpret the holding in Ferrell to mean that ultra vires suits\n\ncannot be maintained against members of the pension board. Appellants counter\n\nthat Ferrell is inapposite to the instant suit because no ultra vires allegations were\n\nasserted in Ferrell beyond the allegation that the pension board violated the statute\n\n                                          19\n\fby misinterpreting it. Appellants aver that they have not merely alleged that the\n\nTrustees misinterpreted the statute. Rather, they point out that they have alleged\n\nthat the Trustees violated Article 6243h by “effectively amending the statute\n\nwithout following the proper statutory procedure.”\n\n      Given the allegations in this case, Heinrich and Ferrell are both instructive.\n\nHeinrich serves to illustrate that a government official may be sued for ultra vires\n\nacts to require the official to comply with statutory or constitutional provisions.\n\nSee 284 S.W.3d at 372. Heinrich also defines what constitutes an ultra vires act,\n\ninstructing that an ultra vires suit “must allege, and ultimately prove, that the\n\nofficer acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.”\n\nId. The suit “must not complain of a government officer’s exercise of discretion.”\n\nId.\n\n      We agree with Appellants that an agency’s exclusive authority to decide a\n\nmatter, or to take an action authorized by a statute, does not insulate the agency’s\n\nofficials from ultra vires claims when they have acted outside of their authority.3\n\nAs Heinrich makes clear, ultra vires claims are, by definition, not against the state\n\nagency involved, but are properly brought against the agency official, who is\n\n3\n      By analogy, courts have held that a party may seek judicial review of an agency\n      action before administrative remedies are exhausted, at a time when the agency\n      retains exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute, if the agency has exercised\n      authority beyond its statutorily conferred powers; that is, when the actions are\n      ultra vires. See Appraisal Rev. Bd. of Harris Cnty. Appraisal Dist. v. O’Connor &\n      Assocs., 267 S.W.3d 413, 419 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.).\n                                         20\n\facting without authority. See id. at 370–72. Ultra vires suits against government\n\nofficials are permitted because they “do not attempt to exert control over the\n\nstate—they attempt to reassert the control of the state.” See id. at 372. Thus, if the\n\npension board members have acted outside their statutory authority, or failed to\n\nperform a ministerial act, they can be sued for such action or inaction, as described\n\nin Heinrich. Such a conclusion is not inconsistent with Ferrell, which did not\n\ninvolve an express assertion of ultra vires claims against the pension board\n\nmembers. Thus, Ferrell does not prohibit a suit based on properly alleged ultra\n\nvires claims.\n\n      Ferrell is, however, instructive to our jurisdictional analysis. If Appellants\n\nare recasting a challenge to a statutorily authorized act by the pension board as an\n\nultra vires claim, then Ferrell prohibits judicial review of that action. Appellants\n\ndo not assert that the Texas Legislature has authorized judicial review of HMEPS’s\n\nactions taken pursuant to Article 6243h.         Ferrell makes clear that, save a\n\nconstitutional violation, there is no right to judicial review of an agency action\n\nwhen the legislature has not expressly authorized such review. See 248 S.W.3d at\n\n158–59.\n\n      With these principles in mind, we turn to the record to determine whether\n\nAppellants’ factual allegations and the jurisdictional evidence establish as a matter\n\nof law that the Trustees “acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely\n\n                                         21\n\fministerial act” or whether, at a minimum, an issue of material fact has been raised\n\nwith respect to the jurisdictional issue. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372. In other\n\nwords, have Appellants sufficiently alleged facts to show that the Trustees acted in\n\nan ultra vires manner?\n\n      1.     Amending the Statute\n\n      Appellants allege that the Trustees acted without authority by unilaterally\n\namending Article 6243h’s definition of “employee” without entering into a meet\n\nand confer agreement pursuant to Section 3(n). Plaintiffs requested the trial court\n\nto declare that the Trustees “acted without legal authority in approving the motion\n\nof August 25, 2011 that illegally changed the definition of ‘employee’ contained in\n\n[s]ection 1(11) of Article 6243h without following the prescribed procedures in\n\n[s]ection 3(n) of the statute.”\n\n      Article 6243h, section 1(11) defines “employee” as follows:\n\n            [A]ny person, including an elected official during the official’s\n      service to the city, who is eligible under this Act and:\n\n            (A) who holds a municipal position or a position with the\n      pension system;\n\n             (B) whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city\n      or of the pension fund; and\n\n             (C) who is paid a regular salary for services.\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fTEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 1(11). A majority of the pension board\n\nvoted to approve the addition of the following language to the foregoing definition\n\nof “employee”:\n\n      “Employee” also includes a full-time employee of a Texas local\n      government corporation (“LGC”) controlled by the City, upon a\n      determination by the External Affairs Committee of the Board of\n      Trustees that such LGC’s employees are Employees for purposes of\n      the Plan.\n\n      Appellants contend that the Trustees were without legal authority to add the\n\nforegoing language to the definition of employee without entering into a meet and\n\nconfer agreement under section 3(n) of the act. We disagree.\n\n      Article 6243h, section 2(x) expressly provides that, not only may it\n\n“interpret and construe” the statute, the pension board may also “correct any\n\ndefect, supply any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency that appears in this\n\nAct in a manner and to the extent that the pension board considers expedient to\n\nadminister this Act for the greatest benefit of all members.” TEX. REV. CIV. STAT.\n\nANN. art. 6243h, § 2(x)(2)–(3) (emphasis added). This provision authorizes the\n\npension board to augment Article 6243h with additional language as it deems\n\nnecessary for the administration of the pension system.        For this reason, the\n\nTrustees were not acting without legal authority when they voted to supplement the\n\ndefinition of “employee.”\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\f      Appellants argue that the added language is an impermissible amendment,\n\nbeyond the scope of a mere interpretation, because it conflicts with the established\n\nstatutory definition of employee and effectively changes its meaning. However,\n\ndetermining the accuracy of Appellants’ assertion would necessarily require\n\ninterpreting the statutory definition of employee and reviewing the propriety of the\n\nboard’s decision to augment the definition, or “supply an omission,” with\n\nadditional language. As indicated in Ferrell, courts are without subject-matter\n\njurisdiction to conduct such a review or to make such determinations. See Ferrell,\n\n248 S.W.3d at 158.\n\n      In addition, Appellants assert that the Trustees were without authority to\n\nsupplement the definition of employee without first entering into a meet and confer\n\nagreement with the City. Appellants contend that such an agreement was required\n\nby Article 6243h, section 3(n), which provides,\n\n      Notwithstanding any other law, the pension board may enter into a\n      written agreement with the city regarding pension issues and benefits.\n      The agreement must be approved by the pension board and the\n      governing body and signed by the mayor and by the pension board or\n      the pension board’s designee. The agreement is enforceable against\n      and binding on the city and the pension system’s members, retirees,\n      deferred participants, beneficiaries, eligible survivors, and alternate\n      payees.\n\nTEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(n). Although it permits the pension\n\nboard to enter into an agreement with the City regarding pension issues and\n\nbenefits, section 3(n) does not require the pension board to enter such an\n                                        24\n\fagreement when, as discussed above, the statute expressly authorizes the board to\n\nact on the issue. More precisely, the statute authorizes the board, in its discretion,\n\nto interpret and to supplement the statute, that is, “to supply any omission,” for the\n\nexpedient administration of the pension system. It does not require a meet and\n\nconfer agreement for such action.\n\n      Appellants also point to past meet and confer agreements in which the\n\nparties had agreed to modify a statutory definition in some fashion. They assert\n\nthat such agreements demonstrate that a meet and confer agreement was required\n\nbefore the pension board could add language to the definition of employee.\n\nRegardless of past practices, the statute does not require a meet and confer\n\nagreement for the pension board to supplement a definition as it deems necessary\n\nin its statutorily conferred discretion.\n\n      Appellants further assert that the pension board has admitted, in certain\n\ndocuments, that its supplementary language was an “amendment” of the statute.\n\nThey cite meet and confer agreements in which the parties agreed to modify a\n\nstatutory definition in some manner. They point to language in those documents\n\nstating that the agreements served to amend or to supersede the statute. Appellants\n\nassert that such language demonstrates that any language added to a statutory\n\ndefinition serves to amend the statute, an act beyond the pension board’s authority\n\nand one reserved for the legislature.\n\n                                           25\n\f      Irrespective of the word choice in the meet and confer agreements relating to\n\nother statutory provisions, the Trustees were within their authority when they acted\n\nin this instance to supplement the definition of employee. Whether one labels the\n\npermitted agency action as a supplementation, an addition, an amendment or some\n\nsynonym thereof, the agency action was permitted by Article 6243h.\n\n      Appellants also point to minutes from the August 25, 2011 board meeting.\n\nThe minutes reflect that the board passed “a [m]otion to approve the amendments\n\nto the HMEPS Pension Plan Document.” Appellants contend that amending the\n\npension plan document is synonymous with amending the statutory definition of\n\n“employee.”\n\n      Article 6243h contemplates the preparation of a pension plan document.\n\nThe statute provides that the pension board may “adopt, for the administration of\n\nthe pension fund, written rules and guidelines” and “may establish and maintain\n\nrecords necessary as appropriate for the proper administration of the pension\n\nfund.” Id. art. 6243h, § 2(x)(1), (5). The statute further expresses that the pension\n\nboard may interpret any “summary plan.” Id. art. 6243h § 2(x)(2).\n\n      As the Trustees point out, the pension board has authority to “amend” or to\n\nmake revisions to the pension plan document. Because Article 6243h provides the\n\npension board with the authority to interpret and to supplement any omitted\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\flanguage, it necessarily follows that the board also has authority to update or to\n\namend the pension plan document to reflect those actions.\n\n      In addition, the Trustees offered evidence indicating that the plan document\n\nis a reference guide prepared by the pension system for the use of the Internal\n\nRevenue Service. In her affidavit, trustee Barbara Chellette testified that “The\n\nPlan Document reflects the Board of Trustees’ interpretations of Article 6243h and\n\nthe meet and confer agreements with the City as in effect . . . .” She also stated\n\nthat “[i]t is routine practice for the full Board of Trustees to amend the Plan\n\nDocument as new information becomes relevant for reference purposes such as to\n\nreflect changes in IRS administrative interpretations.”\n\n      Appellants also contend that a fact issue has been raised by the affidavits\n\noffered as jurisdictional evidence. The Trustees each offered his or her own\n\naffidavit to support the plea. Each testified that, at the August 25, 2011 meeting,\n\nthe board acted to “interpret” whether a City employee remains, for pension\n\npurposes, an employee under Article 6243h, section 1(11) when the employee is\n\ntransferred to a local government corporation. Each stated they did not vote to\n\n“amend” the statute.\n\n      In response, Plaintiffs offered the affidavit of Craig Mason, who voted at the\n\nAugust 25, 2011 board meeting to deny the motion to amend the plan document.\n\n      Mason testified, in part, as follows:\n\n                                         27\n\f      At the August 25, 2011, Regular Meeting, several items were\n      discussed. After these other items had been considered and voted on\n      by the Board of Trustees, the Board was asked to consider proposed\n      amendments to the Houston Municipal Employees’ Pension System’s\n      Plan. One of those proposed amendments concerned a change to the\n      definition of the word “employee” contained in [s]ection 1(11) of\n      Article 6243h.\n\n      During the course of the discussion of the proposed amendment to the\n      definition of “employee,” concern was expressed that employees of a\n      Local Government Corporation (“LGC”) were not “employees” as\n      defined in the statute. That is, some members of the Board were\n      concerned that if employees of the City of Houston transitioned to an\n      LGC, they would cease to be members of HMEPS. Some members of\n      the Board believed that the loss of membership would have a\n      detrimental effect on the funding of the Plan.\n\n      Additionally, there was discussion that in order to prevent former City\n      employees who become employees of an LGC from ceasing to be\n      members of HMEPS the statutory definition of “employee” needed to\n      be amended.\n\n      There was no discussion about any need to clarify or interpret the term\n      “employee.” There was no discussion about any concern that the\n      definition of “employee” was ambiguous, unclear, or incomplete.\n      There was no discussion that the definition of “employee” already\n      encompassed the employees of a local government corporation, or any\n      LGC controlled by the City of Houston and simply needed to be\n      clarified. There was no discussion about the Board of Trustees\n      making an interpretation of “employee” as part of the Board of\n      Trustees’ exercise of discretion under Article 6243h to interpret the\n      statute. Instead the discussion focused on the need [to] amend the\n      definition of the term “employee” to include persons who were\n      excluded under the statutory definition.\n\n      The Trustees objected to the admission of Mason’s affidavit and moved to\n\nstrike it. They asserted it was not relevant to the determination of the jurisdictional\n\nissues and that it contained inadmissible legal conclusions.          The trial court\n                                          28\n\fsustained the Trustees’ objections and granted their motion to strike Mason’s\n\naffidavit. The trial court’s order indicates that it sustained the Trustees’ objections\n\nthat the affidavit contained impermissible legal conclusions and that Mason’s\n\ntestimony was not relevant. See TEX. R. EVID. 401 (defining “relevant evidence”\n\nas evidence having any tendency to make the existence of a fact of consequence\n\nmore or less probable than it would be without the evidence); id. 701 (providing\n\nthat lay witness’s testimony is limited to opinions or inferences rationally based on\n\nperception of witness).\n\n      On appeal, Appellants assert, in their ninth issue, that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in striking Mason’s affidavit. They contend that the contrast between\n\nMason’s affidavit and those of the Trustees, regarding whether the pension board\n\nwas “interpreting” or “amending” the definition of employee, serves to create a\n\nfact issue, precluding the grant of the Trustees’ plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n      As discussed, to determine whether the Trustees engaged in ultra vires\n\nconduct, the inquiry is whether they acted without authority when they\n\nsupplemented the statutory definition of employee under the Article 6243h to\n\ninclude employees of local government corporations. We have determined that\n\nthey had such authority because Article 6243h expressly provides that the pension\n\nboard may not only “interpret and construe” the statute, but may also “correct any\n\ndefect, supply any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency that appears in this\n\n                                          29\n\fAct in a manner and to the extent that the pension board considers expedient to\n\nadminister this Act for the greatest benefit of all members.” TEX. REV. CIV. STAT.\n\nANN. art. 6243h, § 2(x)(2)–(3). We made such legal determination as a matter of\n\nstatutory construction, which is a matter and question of law. See City of Garland\n\nv. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W.3d 351, 357 (Tex. 2000). The board members’\n\ndivergent and subjective views of whether the Trustees acted to “amend” the\n\nstatutory definition or to “interpret” it are not part of that analysis and do not serve\n\nto create a fact issue. See Johnson v. City of Fort Worth, 774 S.W.2d 653, 656\n\n(Tex. 1989) (holding that “matters of statutory construction are questions of law\n\nfor the court to decide rather than issues of fact”). For this reason, Mason’s\n\naffidavit is not material to the legal determination of whether the Trustees acted\n\nwithout authority, and it was not error for the trial court to exclude it. Moreover,\n\nthe trial court’s striking of the affidavit could not have caused the rendition of an\n\nimproper judgment because Mason’s testimony did not affect the answer to the\n\nlegal determination to be made; thus, any error in the striking of the affidavit was\n\nharmless. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a)(1).\n\n      We conclude that, as a matter of law, the Trustees acted with statutory\n\nauthority when they decided to supplement the definition of “employee” contained\n\nin section 1(11), without following the prescribed procedures in section 3(n). It\n\nwas not an ultra vires act, as Appellants claim. See Cf. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at\n\n                                          30\n\f372. Because the legislature has not authorized the trial court to review the board’s\n\ndecision to supplement the definition or to grant the declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief sought, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over the claim as alleged by\n\nAppellants.4 See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 159 (“Because the Legislature has not\n\nauthorized the trial court to grant the relief sought, the trial court lacks jurisdiction\n\nover the case.”).\n\n      2.     Improper Delegation of Authority\n\n      Plaintiffs also contend that the Trustees acted without authority when they\n\nadopted the October 6, 2011 resolution, authorizing the External Affairs\n\nCommittee to determine who would qualify as an “employee.” 5                   Plaintiffs\n\nrequested the trial court to declare that the Trustees “acted without legal authority\n\n\n\n4\n      Appellants also contend that the Trustees engaged in ultra vires conduct because\n      they have not performed purely ministerial acts (1) by failing to pay Klumb,\n      McClelland, and Montejano their pension benefits and (2) by failing to\n      acknowledge the deferred retiree status of Gonzalez, Robles and Pilgrim, instead\n      requiring them to continue to pay into the pension system. Relatedly, Appellants\n      contend that the Trustees have exceeded their authority by determining that\n      Plaintiffs remain employees for pension purposes. The City asserts the Trustees\n      exceeded their authority by requiring Plaintiffs and the City to continue making\n      contributions to HMEPS based on the salaries that Plaintiffs receive from CSSI.\n      However, because the pension board was authorized to supplement the statutory\n      definition of employee to include persons employed by a local government\n      corporation, the conduct complained of by Appellants were not ultra vires acts.\n      Rather, they are authorized pension determinations based on the supplemental\n      language. Such decisions are not subject to judicial review. See Ferrell, 248\n      S.W.3d at 158.\n5\n      The City does not make this argument in its brief.\n                                           31\n\fin adopting the resolution of October 6, 2011 . . . [and] in determining that\n\nPlaintiffs and the members of the putative class are ‘employees’ of the City.”\n\n      Appellants acknowledge that Article 6243h, section 3(k) authorizes the\n\npension board “[to] allocate among the trustees the responsibilities of the pension\n\nboard under this Act.”     See TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(n).\n\nNonetheless, they assert that the Trustees had no authority to adopt the October 6,\n\n2011 resolution, permitting the External Affairs Committee to determine whether\n\n“employees of any entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by the City are\n\nconsidered Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS.”\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that the July 2011 Meet and Confer Agreement amends\n\nSection 3(k), divesting the pension board of the authority to delegate decisions\n\nregarding plan membership. Plaintiffs point to the following provision in the meet\n\nand confer agreement: “Except for meet and confer decisions and personnel\n\ndecisions, no committee shall have authority to make final approvals, but shall\n\nonly make recommendations to the full Board.”\n\n      Plaintiffs also reference text in the Meet and Confer Agreement, providing\n\nthat the parties agree that “certain writings within the Agreement will have the\n\neffect of superseding provisions of the Statute.” That agreement and previous meet\n\nand confer agreements contain statements indicating that certain specifically\n\nidentified provisions of Article 6243h are “amended” by the agreement. Section\n\n                                        32\n\f3(k) is not specifically identified in the Meet and Confer Agreement as being\n\namended by any contractual provision.\n\n      The Trustees correctly point out that a meet and confer agreement is a\n\ncontract. See City of Houston v. Williams, 353 S.W.3d 128, 145 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(characterizing meet and confer agreement as a contract). They cite Town of\n\nFlower Mound v. Rembert Enterprises, Inc., which held that a government\n\nofficial’s failure to comply with a contractual provision cannot serve as the basis\n\nfor an ultra vires claim. 369 S.W.3d 465, 476 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2012, pet.\n\ndenied); see Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 371–72 (“[D]eclaratory-judgment suits\n\nagainst state officials ‘allegedly act[ing] without legal or statutory authority’” are\n\npermissible, but “‘declaratory-judgment suits against state officials seeking to\n\nestablish a contract’s validity, to enforce performance under a contract, or to\n\nimpose contractual liabilities are suits against the State’” and are not permissible as\n\nultra vires suits against individuals in their official capacity) (quoting Tex. Natural\n\nRes. Conservation Comm’n v. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855–56 (Tex. 2002)).\n\n      Plaintiffs respond that the cited case authority is not applicable “to a statute\n\nsuch as Article 6243h, which allows the parties governed by the statute to amend it\n\nby agreement.”     Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that section 3(n) permits the\n\npension board and the City to amend Article 6243h. As described, section 3(n)\n\nprovides, “Notwithstanding any other law, the pension board may enter into a\n\n                                          33\n\fwritten agreement with the city regarding pension issues and benefits.” TEX. REV.\n\nCIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(n). That provision does not address whether the\n\nparties may agree to amend the statute; rather, it provides a means for the parties to\n\nresolve issues between them by contractual agreement. Whether the parties have\n\ncharacterized certain provisions in various meet and confer agreements as having\n\nthe effect of amending certain provisions of Article 6243h may be material to the\n\ncontractual duties each party owes to the other, but it does not serve to amend\n\nArticle 6243h. Had it intended an agreement made under section 3(n) to supersede\n\nor to amend Article 6243h, the legislature could have said as much. See, e.g., TEX.\n\nLOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 143.307(a)–(b) (Vernon 2008) (providing that a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement between police and firefighter associations and\n\nemployers “supersedes a previous statute concerning wages, salaries, rates of pay,\n\nhours of work, or other terms and conditions of employment to the extent of any\n\nconflict with the statute” and such agreement “preempts any contrary statute,\n\nexecutive order, local ordinance, or rule adopted by the state or a political\n\nsubdivision or agent of the state”).\n\n      We conclude that, as a matter of law, the Trustees’ alleged violation of the\n\nMeet and Confer Agreement does not serve as a valid basis for an ultra vires claim.\n\nWe hold that Appellants have not alleged claims conferring subject-matter\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\fjurisdiction on the trial court enabling it to render the declaratory or injunctive\n\nrelief sought. See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 159.\n\n      3.     Non-Compliance with Tax Code\n\n      In the trial court, Plaintiffs alleged that the Trustees committed an ultra vires\n\nact by “adopting a construction of Article 6243h and the Pension Plan that fails to\n\nmeet the qualification requirements of [s]ection 401, Internal Revenue Code . . . as\n\nrequired by [s]ection 2(x) of Article 6243h.” They requested the trial court to\n\nenjoin “the ultra vires action of adopting an illegal amendment to the Pension Plan\n\nthat disqualifies the Pension Plan under the Internal Revenue Code.”\n\n      Article 6243h, section 3(m) provides, “It is intended that this Act be\n\nconstrued and administered in a manner so that the pension system’s benefit plan\n\nwill be considered a qualified plan under Section 401(a), Internal Revenue Code of\n\n1986, as amended.” TEX. CIV. REV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(m). The statute\n\nalso provides that any construction of the act by the pension board “must meet the\n\nqualification requirements established under [Internal Revenue Code Section\n\n401(a)].” See id. § 2(x)(2).\n\n      To qualify as a “governmental plan” under 26 U.S.C. § 401(a), the plan must\n\nbe established and maintained for the employees of a political subdivision of a\n\nstate or its agencies or instrumentalities. See 26 U.S.C. § 414(d). Appellants\n\nacknowledge that the pension board has determined that Plaintiffs are government\n\n                                         35\n\femployees for pension purposes, despite their transfer to CCSI. Appellants assert,\n\nhowever, that because such decision was incorrect, the Trustees have violated\n\nArticle 6243h’s provisions requiring compliance as an IRS qualified plan. It\n\nfollows that a determination of whether the Trustees have violated the act’s\n\nprovisions, requiring compliance as an IRS qualified plan, would necessarily first\n\nrequire a court to conduct a substantive evaluation of the correctness of the pension\n\nboard’s discretionary and statutorily authorized decisions to supplement the\n\ndefinition of employee and to treat Plaintiffs as City employees for pension\n\npurposes.\n\n      As discussed supra, Article 6243h authorized the Trustees to make those\n\ndeterminations. Because they were authorized, these determinations were not ultra\n\nvires acts but were discretionary decisions made by the pension board.             The\n\nsubstantive correctness of those discretionary determinations is not subject to\n\njudicial review. See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158 (“There is no right to judicial\n\nreview of an administrative order unless a statute explicitly provides that\n\nright . . . .”). As a result, the trial court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to\n\nevaluate whether the Trustees committed an ultra vires act by “adopting a\n\nconstruction of Article 6243h and the Pension Plan that fails to meet the\n\nqualification requirements of Section 401, Internal Revenue Code.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\f      We hold that the trial court is without jurisdiction to grant the declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief sought by Appellants based on the pleaded ultra vires claims.\n\nThe trial court did not err when it granted the Trustees’ plea to the jurisdiction on\n\nthose claims.\n\n      We overrule the City’s sole issue. We overrule Plaintiffs’ second, third,\n\nfourth, and ninth issues.\n\n                               Constitutional Claims\n\n      In their fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth issues, Plaintiffs assert that the trial\n\ncourt erred by granting the plea to the jurisdiction with respect to their claims\n\nregarding violations of their state equal-protection and due-course-of-law rights.\n\nHMEPS asserts that it retains its immunity from suit for these claims because, as\n\npled, the claims are not viable.\n\nA.    Equal-Protection Claim\n\n      In their amended petition, Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano\n\nalleged as follows in support of their equal protection claim:\n\n      The Texas Constitution provides that all people “have equal rights,\n      and no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive separate public\n      emoluments, or privileges, but in consideration of public services.”\n      TEX. CONST. art. 1, § 3. HMEPS is treating [Plaintiffs Klumb,\n      McClelland, and Montejano] differently than other individuals such as\n      those who work for Houston Zoo, Inc., Houston READ Commission,\n      Miller Outdoor Theater Advisory Board, Inc., and Houston Parks\n      Board, who have left employment with the City to work with separate\n      legal entities that had business relationships with the City [and are\n      now nonetheless receiving retirement benefits from HMEPS]. As a\n                                          37\n\f      result of the disparate treatment, [Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and\n      Montejano] have been damaged.\n\n      We analyze equal-protection challenges asserted under the state constitution\n\nin the same manner as those claims asserted under the federal constitution. City of\n\nHouston v. Johnson, 353 S.W.3d 499, 503 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011,\n\npet. denied) (citing Bell v. Low Income Women of Tex., 95 S.W.3d 253, 266 (Tex.\n\n2002)). Mirroring the federal constitution, the equal-protection clause of the Texas\n\nconstitution directs governmental actors to treat all similarly situated persons alike.\n\nId.; see TEX. CONST. art. 1, §3.        When, as in this case, neither a suspect\n\nclassification nor a fundamental right is involved, the alleged disparate treatment\n\nbetween similarly situated persons survives constitutional scrutiny if it is rationally\n\nrelated to a legitimate governmental purpose. See Scally v. Tex. State Bd. of Med.\n\nExam’rs, 351 S.W.3d 434, 448 (Tex. App.—Austin 2011, pet. denied).\n\n      If the plaintiff’s constitutional claim is facially invalid, the trial court must\n\ngrant a political subdivision’s plea to the jurisdiction asserting governmental\n\nimmunity. Johnson, 353 S.W.3d at 504. Thus, if a plaintiff fails to plead a viable\n\nclaim, a governmental defendant, such as HMEPS, retains immunity from suit for\n\nthe alleged constitutional violations. Id. (citing Andrade v. NAACP of Austin, 345\n\nS.W.3d 1, 10–12 (Tex. 2011)).\n\n      Equal protection “does not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that\n\na legislature or governing decision maker actually articulate at any time the\n                                          38\n\fpurpose or rationale supporting its classification.” Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1,\n\n15, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 2334 (1992). A governing decision maker “is not subject to\n\ncourtroom fact-finding and [the decision] may be based on rational speculation\n\nunsupported by evidence or empirical data.” F.C.C. v. Beach Commc’ns, Inc., 508\n\nU.S. 307, 315, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 2102 (1993). “For equal protection purposes,\n\ngovernment action has a rational basis if one can be conceived, regardless of\n\nwhether the government had it in mind when it took the action complained of.”\n\nSheffield Dev. Co., Inc. v. City of Glenn Heights, 140 S.W.3d 660, 675 (Tex. 2004)\n\n(citing Owens Corning v. Carter, 997 S.W.2d 560, 581 (Tex. 1999)). A court must\n\nuphold the challenged governmental action if it can conceive of any rational basis\n\nfor the action. See Owens Corning, 997 S.W.2d at 581. We need not review each\n\nand every reason that the action is thought to be rational; we need only find one\n\nrational reason. Garay v. State, 940 S.W.2d 211, 217 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\nDist.] 1997, pet. ref’d).\n\n      Here, HMEPS asserts that it had a rational basis for its decision to treat the\n\nplaintiffs as City employees, who are not entitled to begin receiving retirement\n\nbenefits and who must continue to contribute to the pension system. It avers that it\n\nhas “a legitimate interest in preserving all sources of pension funding by assuring\n\nthat the City meets its full obligations to HMEPS.” It asserts that “[t]he Board’s\n\ndecision advances that interest.” HMEPS contends, “If the City stops contributing\n\n                                        39\n\fto HMEPS on behalf of Department employees, HMEPS will have less money to\n\nsatisfy future benefit obligations. By correctly recognizing that Klumb and his co-\n\nworkers are still covered employees, the Board avoided a threat to HMEPS’s\n\nfunding.”\n\n        We agree with HMEPS that preservation of funding sources is a rational\n\nbasis for the alleged disparate treatment in this case. See U.S. R.R. Ret. Bd. v.\n\nFritz, 449 U.S. 166, 174–75, 101 S. Ct. 453, 459 (1980) (recognizing that\n\npreservation of pension funds is valid reason to treat pensioners differently). For\n\nthis reason, we conclude that Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano have\n\nnot pled a viable equal-protection claim. Thus, HMEPS retains its immunity from\n\nsuit.   We hold that the trial court correctly granted HMEPS’s plea to the\n\njurisdiction on the equal-protection claim.\n\n        We overrule Plaintiffs’ seventh and eighth issues.\n\nB.      Due Course of Law\n\n        With respect to their due course of law claim, Plaintiffs allege as follows:\n\n        The Texas Constitution also provides that “[n]o citizen of this State\n        shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or\n        in any manner disfranchised, except by the course of the law of the\n        land.” TEX. CONST. art. l, § 19. Here, the [Plaintiffs Klumb,\n        McClelland, and Montejano] have a right to receive payments from\n        their vested retirement accounts upon their termination of employment\n        with the City. HMEPS refuses and continues to refuse to pay the\n        benefits to which the [Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano]\n        have a vested right to receive. This is an unlawful taking in violation\n        of Due Course of Law.\n                                           40\n\f         Plaintiffs have a right to contribute their salaries only to organizations\n         and entities of which they are a part. HMEPS is attempting to seize\n         five percent of their salaries. This is an unlawful taking in violation of\n         Due Course of Law.\n\n         HMEPS contends that Plaintiffs do not have a vested property interest at\n\nstake.     Plaintiffs’ due-course-of-law claims require the existence of such a\n\nprotected right. See Combs v. City of Webster, 311 S.W.3d 85, 92 (Tex. App.—\n\nAustin 2009, pet. denied) (citing Spring Branch Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Stamos, 695\n\nS.W.2d 556, 560–62 (Tex. 1985) (involving procedural and substantive due\n\nprocess claims); Dallas Cnty. v. Gonzales, 183 S.W.3d 94, 111 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2006, pet. denied) (same)). If HMEPS is correct in its assertion that Plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to allege a vested property interest, Plaintiffs’ due-course-of-law claims have\n\nno merit, and the trial court properly granted HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction\n\nregarding those claims. See id.\n\n         According to the amended petition, the first property interest at stake for\n\nPlaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano is payment from their retirement\n\naccounts on their termination of employment with the City. HMEPS correctly\n\npoints out that a pensioner in a statutory pension plan does not have a vested right\n\nto his pension. Reames v. Police Officers’ Pension Bd., 928 S.W.2d 628, 632\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1996, no writ); see City of Dallas v. Trammell,\n\n101 S.W.2d 1009, 1012–13 (Tex. 1937) (holding that, because state employee\n\n                                            41\n\fpension plans are from purely statutory origins, pensioner’s right to receive\n\nmonthly payments from statutory pension fund was subordinate to right of\n\nlegislature to completely abolish pension fund or diminish accrued benefits of\n\npensioner under the plan); see also Duckett v. Bd. of Trs., 832 S.W.2d 438, 442\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied).         Here, Plaintiffs Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano have no vested property right in the retirement\n\nbenefits at issue. The amended petition affirmatively negates the existence of\n\njurisdiction over their due-course-of-law claim asserted in relation to those\n\nbenefits. See Combs, 311 S.W.3d at 94.\n\n      Plaintiffs also allege that HMEPS “is attempting to seize five percent of their\n\nsalaries” as monthly contributions into the pension fund. They assert that they\n\nhave a property right in these contributions. HMEPS explains that the City, not the\n\nemployees, pay contributions to HMEPS. HMEPS cites the Benefits Handbook,\n\nwhich was offered by Plaintiffs into evidence.        The handbook explains that\n\nHMEPS members do not pay employee contributions to HMEPS. Rather, the City\n\npays the contribution directly from its treasury to HMEPS. This is also reflected in\n\nArticle 6243h, section 8(c), which provides that “the city shall pay the pickup\n\ncontributions to the pension system from the same source of funds that is used for\n\npaying salaries to the members.        The pickup contributions are in lieu of\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fcontributions [by the members].” TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. art. 6243h, § 8(c) (Vernon\n\n2010).\n\n      HMEPS also points to Devon v. City of San Antonio, which explains as\n\nfollows:\n\n      [D]eductions withheld from [public employees’] wages and paid into\n      the pension fund never belonged to [them], but remained public\n      money used for a public purpose. They were not first segregated from\n      the public funds so as to become [the employees’] private property\n      and then paid into the pension fund; rather, the deductions were “set\n      aside from one public fund and turned over to another” and are no less\n      public money after the payment into the pension fund than before.\n\n443 S.W.2d 598, 600 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1969, writ ref’d) (quoting Trammell,\n\n101 S.W.2d at 1013).\n\n      We agree with HMEPS that the jurisdictional evidence shows, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that the Plaintiffs do not have a property right in the contributions made to the\n\npension system. See id.; see also Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226–28. Accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to assert a viable due-course-of law claim, and HMEPS\n\nretains its immunity from suit regarding that claim. We hold that the trial court\n\nproperly granted HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction on Plaintiffs’ due-course-of law\n\nclaims.\n\n      We overrule Plaintiffs’ fifth and sixth issues. We also overrule Plaintiffs’\n\nfirst issue, generally challenging the granting of the plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                             Motion for Continuance\n\n      In their tenth issue, Plaintiffs assert that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it denied their motion for continuance. Plaintiffs sought a continuance of the\n\nhearing on the plea to the jurisdiction to permit them to conduct additional\n\njurisdictional discovery.\n\n      We apply an abuse-of-discretion standard of review to a trial court’s\n\ndecision on whether to grant a continuance of a plea-to-the-jurisdiction hearing to\n\nallow additional discovery. Garcia v. Kubosh, 377 S.W.3d 89, 113 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.). An appellate court may reverse for abuse of\n\ndiscretion only if it finds that the trial court’s decision was so arbitrary and\n\nunreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law. Joe v. Two\n\nThirty Nine Joint Venture, 145 S.W.3d 150, 162 (Tex. 2004). There is no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in a case in which the trial court could reasonably conclude that\n\nadditional discovery was unnecessary and irrelevant to the legal issues in the case.\n\nId. This is such a case.\n\n      As seen in the discussion of the preceding issues, the determination of the\n\njurisdictional issues in this case is based on the statutory language, the allegations\n\nin Plaintiffs’ pleadings, and basic documents, such as the minutes from the board\n\nmeetings, the Resolution, the Pension Plan Document, and the Meet and Confer\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fAgreement.     The Benefits Handbook, mentioned with respect to determining\n\nPlaintiffs’ due-course-of-law claim, was offered by Plaintiffs.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that they sought a continuance so that they could depose\n\neach Trustee about his or her affidavit in which each testified that the board had\n\ninterpreted, not amended, the definition of employee. Plaintiffs also indicate that\n\nthey wanted a continuance to seek documents and information relating to the\n\nTrustees’ decision-making process with respect to interpreting the definition.\n\nHowever, as discussed supra, the subjective views of the board members are not\n\nmaterial to the legal determination of whether they acted ultra vires in\n\ncontravention of the statute.\n\n      Plaintiffs further indicate that they desired to conduct discovery pertaining to\n\nwhether employees of other legal entities are similarly situated to them.           As\n\ndiscussed, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim fails on the rational-basis analysis\n\nwithout considering whether other persons receiving retirement benefits are\n\nsimilarly situated.\n\n      None of the discovery mentioned by Plaintiffs could have raised a fact issue\n\nmaterial to the determination of the jurisdictional plea. See id. Plaintiffs failed to\n\ndemonstrate that additional discovery was necessary. See id. We hold that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for continuance.\n\n      We overrule Plaintiffs’ tenth issue.\n\n                                         45\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court granting HMEPS’s and the\n\nTrustees’ plea to the jurisdiction and dismissing Appellants’ claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                       Laura Carter Higley\n                                       Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Higley and Brown.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f",

LONG, LEONARD POLK, ROY SANCHEZ, AND\n                  LONNIE VARA, Appellees\n\n\n\n                 On Appeal from the 234th District Court\n                          Harris County, Texas\n                    Trial Court Case No. 2011-75492\n\f                                   OPINION\n\n      This appeal concerns whether the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction\n\nover a suit brought by John Klumb and five other plaintiffs against the Houston\n\nMunicipal Employees Pension System (“HMEPS”) and five members of its board\n\nof trustees. The trial court granted HMEPS’s and the trustees’ plea to the\n\njurisdiction, dismissing the plaintiffs’ claims and the claims of the City of Houston,\n\nwhich had intervened in the suit. On appeal, the plaintiffs and the City of Houston\n\ncontend that the trial court erred by granting the plea. They assert that the suit is\n\nnot barred because it arises from the trustees’ ultra vires acts of violating Article\n\n6243h of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes. Plaintiffs also argue that the trial court\n\nhas jurisdiction over the constitutional claims they have raised.\n\n      Because we agree with HMEPS and the trustees that the trial court lacks\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the pleaded claims, we affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      As a defined benefit pension plan, HMEPS provides retirement, disability,\n\nand survivor benefits for eligible City of Houston employees. Article 6243h of the\n\nTexas Revised Civil Statutes established HMEPS. See TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fart. 6243h, §§ 1–28 (Vernon 2010). 1 Pursuant to Article 6243h, an eleven member\n\nBoard of Trustees, or pension board, has broad authority to administer, manage,\n\nand operate HMEPS. See id. art. 6243h, § 2(a).\n\n      With respect to the pension board’s authority, relevant text of Article 6243h,\n\nsection 2, provides as follows:\n\n      (x) The pension board shall manage the pension fund under this Act\n      and under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may:\n\n             (1) adopt, for the administration of the pension fund,\n             written rules and guidelines;\n\n             (2) interpret and construe this Act and any summary plan,\n             descriptions, or benefits procedures, except that each\n             construction must meet any qualification requirements\n             established under Section 401, Internal Revenue Code of\n             1986, as amended;\n\n             (3) correct any defect, supply any omission, and\n             reconcile any inconsistency that appears in this Act in a\n             manner and to the extent that the pension board considers\n             expedient to administer this Act for the greatest benefit of\n             all members;\n\n             (4) determine all questions, whether legal or factual,\n             relating to eligibility for membership, service, or benefits\n             or relating to the administration of the pension fund to\n             promote the uniform administration of the pension fund\n             for the benefit of all members and retirees; and\n\n\n\n\n1\n      Article 6243h applies only to cities with a population of 1.5 million or more. See\n      TEX. REV. STAT. CIV. ANN. art. 6243h, § 1(4) (Vernon 2010). Houston is\n      currently the only city in Texas with a population of more than 1.5 million.\n                                          3\n\f             (5) establish and maintain records necessary or\n             appropriate for the proper administration of the pension\n             fund.\n\n      (y) The determination of any fact by the pension board and the\n      pension board’s interpretation of this Act are final and binding on any\n      interested party, including members, deferred participants, retirees,\n      eligible survivors, beneficiaries, and the city.\n\n      Id. art. 6243h, § 2(x)–(y).\n\nArticle 6243h also provides that the City of Houston (“the City”) must make\n\nperiodic payments to HMEPS based on a percentage of the combined salaries of\n\nthe pension system members, who are active municipal employees. See id. art.\n\n6243h § 8(d); see also id. art. 6243h, § 1(13).\n\n      In July 2011, the City and HMEPS entered into a contract called a “meet and\n\nconfer agreement.” The July 2001 meet and confer agreement (hereinafter, “the\n\nMeet and Confer Agreement”) addressed, inter alia, the amount of contribution the\n\nCity was required to pay HMEPS for the upcoming fiscal year. Over the years, the\n\nCity and HMEPS have entered into a number of meet and confer agreements\n\nregarding various issues.     Such agreements are authorized by Article 6243h,\n\nsection 3(n). Id. art. 6243h, § 3(n).\n\n      The City’s pension obligation relates generally to the amount of its\n\nemployees’ salaries. The City devised a plan to reduce such budgetary obligation\n\nby having non-City employees perform services previously performed by City\n\nemployees.    To this end, the City merged its Convention and Entertainment\n                                          4\n\fFacilities Department with an existing local government corporation, the Houston\n\nConvention Center Hotel Corporation. Effective July 1, 2011, the City entered into\n\nan Interlocal Agreement and Lease Agreement with the Houston Convention\n\nCenter Hotel Corporation to manage various City-owned facilities, such as\n\ntheaters, convention centers, and parking lots.\n\n      Houston Convention Center Hotel Corporation then changed its name to\n\nHouston First Corporation, which assumed the obligations under the agreement\n\nwith the City. The City planned to transition all but 39 of its employees from its\n\nConvention and Entertainment Facilities Department to Houston First Foundation,\n\na newly created non-profit corporation.       The City planned for the employee\n\ntransfer to reduce its total amount of pension obligation based on its position that\n\nthe transferred employees would no longer be HMEPS “members.”\n\n      Article 6243h, section 1(13) defines “member” as follows: “each active\n\nemployee included in the pension system, except for an employee who is ineligible\n\nunder Section 4 of this Act.” Id. art. 6243h, § 1(13). Article 6243h, section 1(11)\n\nprovides:\n\n            “Employee” means any person, including an elected official\n      during the official’s service to the city, who is eligible under this Act\n      and:\n\n            (A) who holds a municipal position or a position with the\n      pension system;\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      (B) whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city or of\n      the pension fund; and\n\n      (C) who is paid a regular salary for services.\n\nId. art. 6243h, § 1(11).\n\n      On August 25, 2011, HMEPS’s pension board had a meeting. The minutes\n\nfrom the meeting reflect that the board passed “a [m]otion to approve the\n\namendments to the HMEPS Pension Plan Document.” The minutes reflect that\n\nfive trustees voted to approve the motion: (1) Barbara Chellette, (2) David L.\n\nLong, (3) Leonard Polk, (4) Roy Sanchez, and (5) Lonnie Vara. Trustee Craig\n\nMason and another board member voted to deny the motion. Two other trustees\n\nwere absent.\n\n      Also on August 25, 2011, the board chair signed the Pension Plan Document\n\n“As Amended and Restated Effective July 1, 2011.” The Pension Plan Document\n\ncontains a number of definitions, including the definition of “employee.” That\n\ndefinition restates the definition of “employee” found in Article 6243h:\n\n      A person who is eligible under the Act and (a) who holds a municipal\n      position or a position with the Pension System; (b) whose name\n      appears on a regular full-time payroll of the City or of the Pension\n      System; and (c) who is paid a regular salary for services. “Employee”\n      includes an elected official during the official’s service to the City, if\n      he is eligible to participate under the terms of the Pension System as it\n      relates to elected officials.\n\nSee id.\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\f      The pension plan definition, as set out in the Pension Plan Document, further\n\nprovides:\n\n      “Employee” also includes a full-time employee of a Texas local\n      government corporation (“LGC”) controlled by the City, upon a\n      determination by the External Affairs Committee of the Board of\n      Trustees that such LGC’s employees are Employees for purposes of\n      the Plan.\n\n      Before the Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department transferred\n\nany employees to Houston First Foundation, the Board passed and adopted a\n\nresolution on October 6, 2011 (“the Resolution”). The Resolution provides, “[T]he\n\nrequirements for membership in HMEPS are provided under the terms of Article\n\n6243h . . . and the . . . Meet and Confer Agreement dated as of July 2011.” The\n\nResolution further provides, in part, as follows:\n\n      Whereas, the Board of Trustees has previously determined that an\n      “Employee” for purposes of HMEPS includes a full-time employee of\n      Texas local government corporation controlled by the City of Houston\n      (“City”), upon determination by committee of the Board of Trustees\n      consisting of the elected trustees and the trustee appointed by the\n      elected trustees (the “External Affairs Committee”) that such entity’s\n      employees are Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS;\n\n      Whereas, under the interpretations previously adopted by the Board of\n      Trustees, Houston First Corporation and its wholly owned and\n      controlled subsidiary, Houston First Foundation, are controlled by the\n      City, and thus the employees on the payroll of either the Houston First\n      Corporation or the Houston First Foundation are considered\n      Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS;\n\n      Now Therefore Be It Resolved, employees of any entity controlled,\n      directly or indirectly, by the City are considered Employees for\n      purposes of membership in HMEPS, unless the External Affairs\n                                          7\n\f       Committee expressly determines otherwise; provided, however that\n       nothing in this resolution would apply to an individual covered by the\n       Houston Firefighters Relief Retirement Fund or the Houston Police\n       Officers Pension System or any otherwise ineligible employee as\n       determined by the External Affairs Committee . . . .\n\n       On October 24, 2011, Convention and Cultural Services, Inc. (“CCSI”), a\n\nTexas nonprofit corporation, was incorporated. Its articles of incorporation state\n\nthat CCSI was organized for certain purposes, such as supporting “the operation\n\nand maintenance of public assembly facilities and theaters owned by the City of\n\nHouston.”\n\n       An attorney for the City sent a letter to HMEPS, explaining that\n\n“[b]eginning on December 1, 2011, all eligible employees of the Convention and\n\nEntertainment Facilities Department, except for 39 employees who were within\n\nseven years of retirement with HMEPS, would “transition” to CCSI, “which will\n\noperate as an employee leasing company to furnish services to Houston First\n\nCorporation . . . .” The letter continued, “Neither Houston First Corporation nor\n\nHouston First Foundation will have any employees currently employed by\n\n[CCSI] . . . .   Neither the City, the Mayor nor City Council will have any\n\nappointment authority or control over the corporation or its board of directors.”\n\nThe attorney further explained, “[CCSI] will be contracting for its own employee\n\nbenefits, including a 401k plan, and will not participate in any City of Houston\n\nbenefit programs.”\n\n                                         8\n\f      In other words, the City took the position that, beginning December 1, 2011,\n\nall but 39 of the Convention and Entertainment Facilities Department’s employees\n\nwould no longer be City employees; they would be CCSI employees, whose\n\nservices would be leased to Houston First, which would then utilize the CCSI\n\nemployees to manage and operate City facilities. The employees would be doing\n\nthe same job but, according to the City, they would have a different employer and\n\nwould be members of a different pension plan. Thus, the City would no longer be\n\nobligated to make contributions to HMEPS based on those employees’ salaries\n\nbecause they would no longer be City employees.\n\n      HMEPS’s External Affairs Committee met on November 17, 2011.              A\n\nnotation in the meeting minutes indicates that the committee planned to “make\n\ndeterminations regarding Section 3(n) Meet and Confer issues.” The minutes then\n\nindicate that the committee went into a closed session to consider “the documents\n\nregarding the Houston First Corporation and [CCSI].” The minutes show that,\n\nonce back in open session, the External Affairs Committee discussed the\n\ndocuments and passed a motion that “the employees would be in a control group\n\nand that they remain as members of the plan.” The following pension board\n\nmembers were members of the External Affairs Committee: Barbara Chellette,\n\nDavid L. Long, Leonard Polk, Roy Sanchez, and Lonnie Vara.\n\n\n\n\n                                        9\n\f      No one disputes that, before November 30, 2011, John Klumb, Veronica\n\nMcClelland, Vivian Montejano, John Gonzalez, Anita Robles, and Charmaine\n\nPilgrim were employees of the City. Before that date, each of these employees\n\nprovided notice to the City that he or she was terminating his or her employment\n\nwith the City at the end of business on November 30.                These employees\n\ntransitioned to CCSI, effective December 1, 2011.               Klumb, McClelland,\n\nMontejano, Gonzalez, Robles, Pilgrim, and the City claimed that, beginning\n\nDecember 1, 2011, these individuals were no longer employees of the City but\n\nwere employees of CCSI.\n\n      Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano each applied to begin receiving\n\nretirement benefits from HMEPS. Under Article 6243h, and as agreed in the Meet\n\nand Confer Agreement, a member of the pension system, who terminates\n\nemployment with the City, is eligible for a normal retirement pension, beginning\n\non the member’s effective retirement date, if the member (1) completes at least\n\nfive years of credit service and attains either 62 years of age or (2) the member is at\n\nleast 50 years old and, when added together, the member’s age and years of\n\ncredited service equal the number 75.          See id. art. 6243h, § 10(b).    Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano each took the position that he or she was eligible to\n\nreceive retirement benefits from HMEPS because he or she had terminated\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\femployment with the City and met one of the retirement criteria of Article 6243h,\n\nsection 10.\n\n      HMEPS disagreed, denying the applications of Klumb, McClelland, and\n\nMontejano for retirement benefits. HMEPS took the position that these individuals\n\nremained municipal employees, despite their transfer to CCSI. HMEPS based its\n\ndecision on the definition of “employee” as found in the July 2011 Pension Plan\n\nDocument.\n\n      Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim did not contend that they were eligible to\n\nreceive retirement benefits from HMEPS after being transferred to CCSI. Rather,\n\nthey asserted that they were entitled to defer their retirement status because they\n\nwere no longer employees of the City. The City also held this position. HMEPS\n\ndisagreed, averring that Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim also remained City\n\nemployees.     HMEPS asserted that these individuals must continue to make\n\nmonthly contributions to HMEPS, and the City must continue to make\n\ncontributions to HMEPS based on their salaries.\n\n      Klumb,     McClelland,      Montejano,      Gonzalez,      Robles,      and   Pilgrim\n\n(collectively, at times, “Plaintiffs”) filed suit against HMEPS, asserting claims for\n\nconstitutional violations and breach of contract.             Plaintiffs also sought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment. 2 They asserted that, by continuing to define them as City\n\n\n2\n      The suit was filed as a class action but was never certified as such.\n                                            11\n\femployees, HMEPS was violating Article 6243h. Plaintiffs also alleged that, by\n\ntreating them as City employees, HMEPS was violating a section of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code. They requested the trial court to declare that they were no longer\n\nCity employees. Plaintiffs also sought monetary damages from HMEPS.\n\n      HMEPS filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action. HMEPS argued\n\nthat Article 6243h does not provide for judicial review of its board’s decisions,\n\nparticularly those decisions based on an interpretation of Article 6243h. It asserted\n\nthat the trial court lacked jurisdiction to review the board’s decision that Plaintiffs\n\nremain city “employees” under Article 6243h. HMEPS also asserted immunity\n\nfrom suit with respect to Plaintiffs’ breach of contract and constitutional claims.\n\n      Plaintiffs filed an amended petition. They sued not only HMEPS, but also\n\nfive members of its board of trustees: (1) Barbara Chellette, (2) David L. Long, (3)\n\nLeonard Polk, (4) Roy Sanchez, and (5) Lonnie Vara (collectively, “the Trustees”).\n\nSeeking declaratory and injunctive relief, Plaintiffs alleged that the Trustees had, in\n\ntheir official capacities, committed the following ultra vires acts in violation of\n\nArticle 6243h:\n\n• “[V]oting to approve the motion of August 25, 2011, containing an\n  unauthorized amendment of the statute and the Pension Plan; viz., a\n  unilateral change to the definition of ‘employee’ that is totally\n  inconsistent with the statutory definition contained in Section 1(11) of\n  Article 6243h.” The “change was made in violation of the statutorily-\n\n                                          12\n\f   prescribed procedure set forth in [s]ection 3(n) of Article 6243h for\n   amending the statute and Pension Plan under such circumstances.”\n\n• “[V]oting to adopt the resolution of October 6, 2011 . . . implement[ing]\n  the ultra vires amendment to the Pension Plan that unilaterally changed\n  the statutory definition of ‘employee’ in [s]ection 1(11) of Article\n  6243h.” Included in this ultra vires act was “an illegal determination that\n  Plaintiffs were ‘employees’ under the Pension Plan, as that determination\n  was based on an unauthorized amendment to the Pension Plan that was\n  adopted in violation of [s]ection 3(n) of Article 6243h.”\n\n• “Adopting the October 6, 2011 resolution which purported to authorize\n  an External Affairs Committee to determine who would qualify as an\n  ‘employee’ under the illegal Pension Plan Amendment.”\n\n• “Adopting a construction of Article 6243h and the Pension Plan that fails\n  to meet the qualification requirements of [s]ection 401, Internal Revenue\n  Code of 1986, as amended, as required by [s]ection 2(x) of Article\n  6243h.”\n\n• Refusing to pay Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano their retirement\n  benefits and denying Gonzalez, Robles, and Pilgrim their right to defer\n  their retirement status.\n\n      Plaintiffs requested the trial court to declare that the Trustees (1) “acted\n\nwithout legal authority in approving the motion of August 25, 2011 . . . illegally\n\nchang[ing] the definition of ‘employee’ contained in ection 1(11) of Article 6243h\n\nwithout following the prescribed procedures in Section 3(n) of the statute”; (2)\n\n“acted without legal authority in adopting the resolution of October 6, 2011”; and\n\n(3) “acted without legal authority in determining that Plaintiffs and the members of\n\nthe putative class are ‘employees’ of the City.” Plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the\n\nTrustees from enforcing the alleged ultra vires acts, including a request that the\n\n                                         13\n\ftrial court enjoin “the ultra vires action of adopting an illegal amendment to the\n\nPension Plan that disqualifies the Pension Plan under the Internal Revenue Code.”\n\n      In addition, Plaintiffs asserted constitutional claims against HMEPS.\n\nKlumb, McClelland, and Montejano asserted that they have been denied equal\n\nprotection under the Texas Constitution because HMEPS is treating them\n\ndifferently than it has treated past employees who have left employment with the\n\nCity to work for other legal entities and who are now receiving retirement benefits.\n\nThey also contended that their right to due course of law under the Texas\n\nConstitution has been abridged because they have a right to receive their vested\n\nretirement benefits. All Plaintiffs asserted a due course of law violation, alleging\n\nthat HMEPS’s attempt “to seize” contributions from their salaries is an unlawful\n\ntaking in violation of their due course of law rights.\n\n      The City filed a petition in intervention. It generally echoed Plaintiffs’\n\nallegations that the Trustees had engaged in ultra vires acts in violation of Article\n\n6243h. The City also sought injunctive and declaratory relief.\n\n      HMEPS filed an amended plea to the jurisdiction in which the Trustees\n\njoined. They asserted that the claims in the suit emanate from the pension board’s\n\ninterpretation of Article 6243h, specifically its construction of whether Plaintiffs fit\n\nwithin the statutory definition “employee.” HMEPS and the Trustees argued that\n\nthe trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit because the board’s\n\n                                          14\n\finterpretation of Article 6243h, per the statute, is final and binding with no right of\n\njudicial review. HMEPS and the Trustees asserted that the allegations of ultra\n\nvires acts are an attempt to recast claims of statutory misinterpretation solely for\n\nthe purpose of creating jurisdiction.          HMEPS also alleged that Plaintiffs’\n\nconstitutional claims are barred by sovereign immunity.\n\n      Plaintiffs and the City responded to the plea. After a hearing, the trial court\n\ngranted the plea to the jurisdiction. It rendered judgment dismissing the Plaintiffs’\n\nand the City’s claims for lack of jurisdiction. This appeal followed.\n\n      On appeal, Plaintiffs list ten issues in their brief. Issues one through eight\n\nraise both general and specific challenges to the trial court’s grant of the plea to the\n\njurisdiction. Issue nine addresses the trial court’s evidentiary ruling striking an\n\naffidavit offered by Plaintiffs in support of their response. Issue ten speaks to\n\nPlaintiffs’ challenge to the trial court’s denial of their motion for continuance. In\n\nits brief, the City raises one general issue challenging the trial court’s decision to\n\ngrant the plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n                               Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\nA.

Ultra Vires Claims\n\n      In their second, third, and fourth issues, Plaintiffs assert that the trial court\n\nerred by granting the plea to the jurisdiction with respect to their ultra vires claims\n\nrequesting declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs also contend in their ninth\n\nissue that the trial court abused its discretion by striking an affidavit they offered as\n\njurisdictional evidence. The City, in its sole issue, offers arguments aligned with\n\nthose of Plaintiffs with respect to the ultra vires claims.         Thus, for ease of\n\nreference, we refer collectively to the City and Plaintiffs as “Appellants.”\n\n      Appellants contend that the trial court has subject-matter jurisdiction over\n\ntheir ultra vires claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in which they seek to\n\nrequire the Trustees to comply with the provisions of Article 6243h. Appellants\n\ncite City of El Paso v. Heinrich for the proposition that ultra vires suits seeking “to\n\nrequire state officials to comply with statutory or constitutional provisions are not\n\nprohibited by sovereign immunity.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 372 (Tex. 2009).\n\n      The Trustees are critical of Appellants’ reliance on Heinrich. They point out\n\nthat their plea to the jurisdiction did not seek to dismiss Appellants’ claims for\n\n                                           17\n\fdeclaratory and injunctive relief based on sovereign immunity.          Rather, they\n\nasserted that the trial court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because the board of\n\ntrustees has exclusive authority to interpret Article 6243h and to make benefits\n\ndecisions. The Trustees argue that there is no right of judicial review of such\n\ndeterminations.\n\n      In support of their position, the Trustees rely on Houston Municipal\n\nEmployees Pension System v. Ferrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894925\"><a href=\"/opinion/894925/houston-mun-empl-pension-sys-v-ferrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2007). There, the\n\nSupreme Court of Texas dismissed a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief\n\nagainst HMEPS in which the plaintiffs were challenging a benefits decision by the\n\nboard. Id. at 158–59. The plaintiffs asked “the trial court to hold that the statute\n\nrequires the pension board to credit each plaintiff’s retirement account with time\n\nserved . . . and [to hold] that the pension board was violating the law by refusing to\n\ngrant such credit.” Id. at 158. The plaintiffs also “requested that the trial court\n\nissue an injunction directing the pension board to comply with the trial court’s\n\ninterpretation of Article 6243h.” Id. at 158–59.\n\n      In determining whether the trial court had jurisdiction over the claims, the\n\nFerrell court reiterated the well-established precept, “There is no right to judicial\n\nreview of an administrative order unless a statute explicitly provides that right or\n\nthe order violates a constitutional right.” Id. at 158 (citing Gen.

The\n\ncourt further explained that “when an act is either silent on the question of appeal\n\nor expressly denies a right to appeal, a party may appeal only ‘where the\n\nadministrative action complained of violates a constitutional provision.’”         Id.\n\n(citing Hancock, 239 S.W.2d at 790).\n\n      The Ferrell court underscored that Article 6243h provides, “The\n\ndetermination of any fact by the pension board and the pension board’s\n\ninterpretation of this Act are final and binding on any interested party.” Id. (citing\n\nTEX. REV.CIV. STAT. art. 6243h, § 2(y)). The court concluded that the relief sought\n\nby the plaintiffs, “whether labeled a declaratory judgment or review of a pension\n\nboard decision, exceeds the power of the trial court as limited by the ‘final and\n\nbinding’ language of Article 6243h.” Id. at 159. The court held, “Because the\n\nLegislature has not authorized the trial court to grant the relief sought, the trial\n\ncourt lacks jurisdiction over the case.” Id.\n\n      The Trustees interpret the holding in Ferrell to mean that ultra vires suits\n\ncannot be maintained against members of the pension board. Appellants counter\n\nthat Ferrell is inapposite to the instant suit because no ultra vires allegations were\n\nasserted in Ferrell beyond the allegation that the pension board violated the statute\n\n                                          19\n\fby misinterpreting it. Appellants aver that they have not merely alleged that the\n\nTrustees misinterpreted the statute. Rather, they point out that they have alleged\n\nthat the Trustees violated Article 6243h by “effectively amending the statute\n\nwithout following the proper statutory procedure.”\n\n      Given the allegations in this case, Heinrich and Ferrell are both instructive.\n\nHeinrich serves to illustrate that a government official may be sued for ultra vires\n\nacts to require the official to comply with statutory or constitutional provisions.\n\nSee 284 S.W.3d at 372. Heinrich also defines what constitutes an ultra vires act,\n\ninstructing that an ultra vires suit “must allege, and ultimately prove, that the\n\nofficer acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely ministerial act.”\n\nId. The suit “must not complain of a government officer’s exercise of discretion.”\n\nId.\n\n      We agree with Appellants that an agency’s exclusive authority to decide a\n\nmatter, or to take an action authorized by a statute, does not insulate the agency’s\n\nofficials from ultra vires claims when they have acted outside of their authority.3\n\nAs Heinrich makes clear, ultra vires claims are, by definition, not against the state\n\nagency involved, but are properly brought against the agency official, who is\n\n3\n      By analogy, courts have held that a party may seek judicial review of an agency\n      action before administrative remedies are exhausted, at a time when the agency\n      retains exclusive jurisdiction over the dispute, if the agency has exercised\n      authority beyond its statutorily conferred powers; that is, when the actions are\n      ultra vires. See Appraisal Rev. Bd. of Harris Cnty. Appraisal Dist. v. O’Connor &\n      Assocs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1794245\"><a href=\"/opinion/1794245/review-bd-of-harris-v-oconnor-assoc/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 419 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.).\n                                         20\n\facting without authority. See id. at 370–72. Ultra vires suits against government\n\nofficials are permitted because they “do not attempt to exert control over the\n\nstate—they attempt to reassert the control of the state.” See id. at 372. Thus, if the\n\npension board members have acted outside their statutory authority, or failed to\n\nperform a ministerial act, they can be sued for such action or inaction, as described\n\nin Heinrich. Such a conclusion is not inconsistent with Ferrell, which did not\n\ninvolve an express assertion of ultra vires claims against the pension board\n\nmembers. Thus, Ferrell does not prohibit a suit based on properly alleged ultra\n\nvires claims.\n\n      Ferrell is, however, instructive to our jurisdictional analysis. If Appellants\n\nare recasting a challenge to a statutorily authorized act by the pension board as an\n\nultra vires claim, then Ferrell prohibits judicial review of that action. Appellants\n\ndo not assert that the Texas Legislature has authorized judicial review of HMEPS’s\n\nactions taken pursuant to Article 6243h.         Ferrell makes clear that, save a\n\nconstitutional violation, there is no right to judicial review of an agency action\n\nwhen the legislature has not expressly authorized such review. See 248 S.W.3d at\n\n158–59.\n\n      With these principles in mind, we turn to the record to determine whether\n\nAppellants’ factual allegations and the jurisdictional evidence establish as a matter\n\nof law that the Trustees “acted without legal authority or failed to perform a purely\n\n                                         21\n\fministerial act” or whether, at a minimum, an issue of material fact has been raised\n\nwith respect to the jurisdictional issue. See Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at 372. In other\n\nwords, have Appellants sufficiently alleged facts to show that the Trustees acted in\n\nan ultra vires manner?\n\n      1.     Amending the Statute\n\n      Appellants allege that the Trustees acted without authority by unilaterally\n\namending Article 6243h’s definition of “employee” without entering into a meet\n\nand confer agreement pursuant to Section 3(n). Plaintiffs requested the trial court\n\nto declare that the Trustees “acted without legal authority in approving the motion\n\nof August 25, 2011 that illegally changed the definition of ‘employee’ contained in\n\n[s]ection 1(11) of Article 6243h without following the prescribed procedures in\n\n[s]ection 3(n) of the statute.”\n\n      Article 6243h, section 1(11) defines “employee” as follows:\n\n            [A]ny person, including an elected official during the official’s\n      service to the city, who is eligible under this Act and:\n\n            (A) who holds a municipal position or a position with the\n      pension system;\n\n             (B) whose name appears on a regular full-time payroll of a city\n      or of the pension fund; and\n\n             (C) who is paid a regular salary for services.\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fTEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 1(11). A majority of the pension board\n\nvoted to approve the addition of the following language to the foregoing definition\n\nof “employee”:\n\n      “Employee” also includes a full-time employee of a Texas local\n      government corporation (“LGC”) controlled by the City, upon a\n      determination by the External Affairs Committee of the Board of\n      Trustees that such LGC’s employees are Employees for purposes of\n      the Plan.\n\n      Appellants contend that the Trustees were without legal authority to add the\n\nforegoing language to the definition of employee without entering into a meet and\n\nconfer agreement under section 3(n) of the act. We disagree.\n\n      Article 6243h, section 2(x) expressly provides that, not only may it\n\n“interpret and construe” the statute, the pension board may also “correct any\n\ndefect, supply any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency that appears in this\n\nAct in a manner and to the extent that the pension board considers expedient to\n\nadminister this Act for the greatest benefit of all members.” TEX. REV. CIV. STAT.\n\nANN. art. 6243h, § 2(x)(2)–(3) (emphasis added). This provision authorizes the\n\npension board to augment Article 6243h with additional language as it deems\n\nnecessary for the administration of the pension system.        For this reason, the\n\nTrustees were not acting without legal authority when they voted to supplement the\n\ndefinition of “employee.”\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\f      Appellants argue that the added language is an impermissible amendment,\n\nbeyond the scope of a mere interpretation, because it conflicts with the established\n\nstatutory definition of employee and effectively changes its meaning. However,\n\ndetermining the accuracy of Appellants’ assertion would necessarily require\n\ninterpreting the statutory definition of employee and reviewing the propriety of the\n\nboard’s decision to augment the definition, or “supply an omission,” with\n\nadditional language. As indicated in Ferrell, courts are without subject-matter\n\njurisdiction to conduct such a review or to make such determinations. See Ferrell,\n\n248 S.W.3d at 158.\n\n      In addition, Appellants assert that the Trustees were without authority to\n\nsupplement the definition of employee without first entering into a meet and confer\n\nagreement with the City. Appellants contend that such an agreement was required\n\nby Article 6243h, section 3(n), which provides,\n\n      Notwithstanding any other law, the pension board may enter into a\n      written agreement with the city regarding pension issues and benefits.\n      The agreement must be approved by the pension board and the\n      governing body and signed by the mayor and by the pension board or\n      the pension board’s designee. The agreement is enforceable against\n      and binding on the city and the pension system’s members, retirees,\n      deferred participants, beneficiaries, eligible survivors, and alternate\n      payees.\n\nTEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(n). Although it permits the pension\n\nboard to enter into an agreement with the City regarding pension issues and\n\nbenefits, section 3(n) does not require the pension board to enter such an\n                                        24\n\fagreement when, as discussed above, the statute expressly authorizes the board to\n\nact on the issue. More precisely, the statute authorizes the board, in its discretion,\n\nto interpret and to supplement the statute, that is, “to supply any omission,” for the\n\nexpedient administration of the pension system. It does not require a meet and\n\nconfer agreement for such action.\n\n      Appellants also point to past meet and confer agreements in which the\n\nparties had agreed to modify a statutory definition in some fashion. They assert\n\nthat such agreements demonstrate that a meet and confer agreement was required\n\nbefore the pension board could add language to the definition of employee.\n\nRegardless of past practices, the statute does not require a meet and confer\n\nagreement for the pension board to supplement a definition as it deems necessary\n\nin its statutorily conferred discretion.\n\n      Appellants further assert that the pension board has admitted, in certain\n\ndocuments, that its supplementary language was an “amendment” of the statute.\n\nThey cite meet and confer agreements in which the parties agreed to modify a\n\nstatutory definition in some manner. They point to language in those documents\n\nstating that the agreements served to amend or to supersede the statute. Appellants\n\nassert that such language demonstrates that any language added to a statutory\n\ndefinition serves to amend the statute, an act beyond the pension board’s authority\n\nand one reserved for the legislature.\n\n                                           25\n\f      Irrespective of the word choice in the meet and confer agreements relating to\n\nother statutory provisions, the Trustees were within their authority when they acted\n\nin this instance to supplement the definition of employee. Whether one labels the\n\npermitted agency action as a supplementation, an addition, an amendment or some\n\nsynonym thereof, the agency action was permitted by Article 6243h.\n\n      Appellants also point to minutes from the August 25, 2011 board meeting.\n\nThe minutes reflect that the board passed “a [m]otion to approve the amendments\n\nto the HMEPS Pension Plan Document.” Appellants contend that amending the\n\npension plan document is synonymous with amending the statutory definition of\n\n“employee.”\n\n      Article 6243h contemplates the preparation of a pension plan document.\n\nThe statute provides that the pension board may “adopt, for the administration of\n\nthe pension fund, written rules and guidelines” and “may establish and maintain\n\nrecords necessary as appropriate for the proper administration of the pension\n\nfund.” Id. art. 6243h, § 2(x)(1), (5). The statute further expresses that the pension\n\nboard may interpret any “summary plan.” Id. art. 6243h § 2(x)(2).\n\n      As the Trustees point out, the pension board has authority to “amend” or to\n\nmake revisions to the pension plan document. Because Article 6243h provides the\n\npension board with the authority to interpret and to supplement any omitted\n\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\flanguage, it necessarily follows that the board also has authority to update or to\n\namend the pension plan document to reflect those actions.\n\n      In addition, the Trustees offered evidence indicating that the plan document\n\nis a reference guide prepared by the pension system for the use of the Internal\n\nRevenue Service. In her affidavit, trustee Barbara Chellette testified that “The\n\nPlan Document reflects the Board of Trustees’ interpretations of Article 6243h and\n\nthe meet and confer agreements with the City as in effect . . . .” She also stated\n\nthat “[i]t is routine practice for the full Board of Trustees to amend the Plan\n\nDocument as new information becomes relevant for reference purposes such as to\n\nreflect changes in IRS administrative interpretations.”\n\n      Appellants also contend that a fact issue has been raised by the affidavits\n\noffered as jurisdictional evidence. The Trustees each offered his or her own\n\naffidavit to support the plea. Each testified that, at the August 25, 2011 meeting,\n\nthe board acted to “interpret” whether a City employee remains, for pension\n\npurposes, an employee under Article 6243h, section 1(11) when the employee is\n\ntransferred to a local government corporation. Each stated they did not vote to\n\n“amend” the statute.\n\n      In response, Plaintiffs offered the affidavit of Craig Mason, who voted at the\n\nAugust 25, 2011 board meeting to deny the motion to amend the plan document.\n\n      Mason testified, in part, as follows:\n\n                                         27\n\f      At the August 25, 2011, Regular Meeting, several items were\n      discussed. After these other items had been considered and voted on\n      by the Board of Trustees, the Board was asked to consider proposed\n      amendments to the Houston Municipal Employees’ Pension System’s\n      Plan. One of those proposed amendments concerned a change to the\n      definition of the word “employee” contained in [s]ection 1(11) of\n      Article 6243h.\n\n      During the course of the discussion of the proposed amendment to the\n      definition of “employee,” concern was expressed that employees of a\n      Local Government Corporation (“LGC”) were not “employees” as\n      defined in the statute. That is, some members of the Board were\n      concerned that if employees of the City of Houston transitioned to an\n      LGC, they would cease to be members of HMEPS. Some members of\n      the Board believed that the loss of membership would have a\n      detrimental effect on the funding of the Plan.\n\n      Additionally, there was discussion that in order to prevent former City\n      employees who become employees of an LGC from ceasing to be\n      members of HMEPS the statutory definition of “employee” needed to\n      be amended.\n\n      There was no discussion about any need to clarify or interpret the term\n      “employee.” There was no discussion about any concern that the\n      definition of “employee” was ambiguous, unclear, or incomplete.\n      There was no discussion that the definition of “employee” already\n      encompassed the employees of a local government corporation, or any\n      LGC controlled by the City of Houston and simply needed to be\n      clarified. There was no discussion about the Board of Trustees\n      making an interpretation of “employee” as part of the Board of\n      Trustees’ exercise of discretion under Article 6243h to interpret the\n      statute. Instead the discussion focused on the need [to] amend the\n      definition of the term “employee” to include persons who were\n      excluded under the statutory definition.\n\n      The Trustees objected to the admission of Mason’s affidavit and moved to\n\nstrike it. They asserted it was not relevant to the determination of the jurisdictional\n\nissues and that it contained inadmissible legal conclusions.          The trial court\n                                          28\n\fsustained the Trustees’ objections and granted their motion to strike Mason’s\n\naffidavit. The trial court’s order indicates that it sustained the Trustees’ objections\n\nthat the affidavit contained impermissible legal conclusions and that Mason’s\n\ntestimony was not relevant. See TEX. R. EVID. 401 (defining “relevant evidence”\n\nas evidence having any tendency to make the existence of a fact of consequence\n\nmore or less probable than it would be without the evidence); id. 701 (providing\n\nthat lay witness’s testimony is limited to opinions or inferences rationally based on\n\nperception of witness).\n\n      On appeal, Appellants assert, in their ninth issue, that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in striking Mason’s affidavit. They contend that the contrast between\n\nMason’s affidavit and those of the Trustees, regarding whether the pension board\n\nwas “interpreting” or “amending” the definition of employee, serves to create a\n\nfact issue, precluding the grant of the Trustees’ plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n      As discussed, to determine whether the Trustees engaged in ultra vires\n\nconduct, the inquiry is whether they acted without authority when they\n\nsupplemented the statutory definition of employee under the Article 6243h to\n\ninclude employees of local government corporations. We have determined that\n\nthey had such authority because Article 6243h expressly provides that the pension\n\nboard may not only “interpret and construe” the statute, but may also “correct any\n\ndefect, supply any omission, and reconcile any inconsistency that appears in this\n\n                                          29\n\fAct in a manner and to the extent that the pension board considers expedient to\n\nadminister this Act for the greatest benefit of all members.” TEX. REV. CIV. STAT.\n\nANN. art. 6243h, § 2(x)(2)–(3). We made such legal determination as a matter of\n\nstatutory construction, which is a matter and question of law. See City of Garland\n\nv. Dallas Morning News, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1376478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1376478/city-of-garland-v-dallas-morning-news/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 357 (Tex. 2000). The board members’\n\ndivergent and subjective views of whether the Trustees acted to “amend” the\n\nstatutory definition or to “interpret” it are not part of that analysis and do not serve\n\nto create a fact issue. See Johnson v. City of Fort Worth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2405645\"><a href=\"/opinion/2405645/johnson-v-city-of-fort-worth/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656\n\n(Tex. 1989) (holding that “matters of statutory construction are questions of law\n\nfor the court to decide rather than issues of fact”). For this reason, Mason’s\n\naffidavit is not material to the legal determination of whether the Trustees acted\n\nwithout authority, and it was not error for the trial court to exclude it. Moreover,\n\nthe trial court’s striking of the affidavit could not have caused the rendition of an\n\nimproper judgment because Mason’s testimony did not affect the answer to the\n\nlegal determination to be made; thus, any error in the striking of the affidavit was\n\nharmless. See TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1(a)(1).\n\n      We conclude that, as a matter of law, the Trustees acted with statutory\n\nauthority when they decided to supplement the definition of “employee” contained\n\nin section 1(11), without following the prescribed procedures in section 3(n). It\n\nwas not an ultra vires act, as Appellants claim. See Cf. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d at\n\n                                          30\n\f372. Because the legislature has not authorized the trial court to review the board’s\n\ndecision to supplement the definition or to grant the declaratory and injunctive\n\nrelief sought, the trial court does not have jurisdiction over the claim as alleged by\n\nAppellants.4 See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 159 (“Because the Legislature has not\n\nauthorized the trial court to grant the relief sought, the trial court lacks jurisdiction\n\nover the case.”).\n\n      2.     Improper Delegation of Authority\n\n      Plaintiffs also contend that the Trustees acted without authority when they\n\nadopted the October 6, 2011 resolution, authorizing the External Affairs\n\nCommittee to determine who would qualify as an “employee.” 5                   Plaintiffs\n\nrequested the trial court to declare that the Trustees “acted without legal authority\n\n\n\n4\n      Appellants also contend that the Trustees engaged in ultra vires conduct because\n      they have not performed purely ministerial acts (1) by failing to pay Klumb,\n      McClelland, and Montejano their pension benefits and (2) by failing to\n      acknowledge the deferred retiree status of Gonzalez, Robles and Pilgrim, instead\n      requiring them to continue to pay into the pension system. Relatedly, Appellants\n      contend that the Trustees have exceeded their authority by determining that\n      Plaintiffs remain employees for pension purposes. The City asserts the Trustees\n      exceeded their authority by requiring Plaintiffs and the City to continue making\n      contributions to HMEPS based on the salaries that Plaintiffs receive from CSSI.\n      However, because the pension board was authorized to supplement the statutory\n      definition of employee to include persons employed by a local government\n      corporation, the conduct complained of by Appellants were not ultra vires acts.\n      Rather, they are authorized pension determinations based on the supplemental\n      language. Such decisions are not subject to judicial review. See Ferrell, 248\n      S.W.3d at 158.\n5\n      The City does not make this argument in its brief.\n                                           31\n\fin adopting the resolution of October 6, 2011 . . . [and] in determining that\n\nPlaintiffs and the members of the putative class are ‘employees’ of the City.”\n\n      Appellants acknowledge that Article 6243h, section 3(k) authorizes the\n\npension board “[to] allocate among the trustees the responsibilities of the pension\n\nboard under this Act.”     See TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(n).\n\nNonetheless, they assert that the Trustees had no authority to adopt the October 6,\n\n2011 resolution, permitting the External Affairs Committee to determine whether\n\n“employees of any entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by the City are\n\nconsidered Employees for purposes of membership in HMEPS.”\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that the July 2011 Meet and Confer Agreement amends\n\nSection 3(k), divesting the pension board of the authority to delegate decisions\n\nregarding plan membership. Plaintiffs point to the following provision in the meet\n\nand confer agreement: “Except for meet and confer decisions and personnel\n\ndecisions, no committee shall have authority to make final approvals, but shall\n\nonly make recommendations to the full Board.”\n\n      Plaintiffs also reference text in the Meet and Confer Agreement, providing\n\nthat the parties agree that “certain writings within the Agreement will have the\n\neffect of superseding provisions of the Statute.” That agreement and previous meet\n\nand confer agreements contain statements indicating that certain specifically\n\nidentified provisions of Article 6243h are “amended” by the agreement. Section\n\n                                        32\n\f3(k) is not specifically identified in the Meet and Confer Agreement as being\n\namended by any contractual provision.\n\n      The Trustees correctly point out that a meet and confer agreement is a\n\ncontract.

Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(characterizing meet and confer agreement as a contract).

As described, section 3(n)\n\nprovides, “Notwithstanding any other law, the pension board may enter into a\n\n                                          33\n\fwritten agreement with the city regarding pension issues and benefits.” TEX. REV.\n\nCIV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(n). That provision does not address whether the\n\nparties may agree to amend the statute; rather, it provides a means for the parties to\n\nresolve issues between them by contractual agreement. Whether the parties have\n\ncharacterized certain provisions in various meet and confer agreements as having\n\nthe effect of amending certain provisions of Article 6243h may be material to the\n\ncontractual duties each party owes to the other, but it does not serve to amend\n\nArticle 6243h. Had it intended an agreement made under section 3(n) to supersede\n\nor to amend Article 6243h, the legislature could have said as much. See, e.g., TEX.\n\nLOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 143.307(a)–(b) (Vernon 2008) (providing that a\n\ncollective bargaining agreement between police and firefighter associations and\n\nemployers “supersedes a previous statute concerning wages, salaries, rates of pay,\n\nhours of work, or other terms and conditions of employment to the extent of any\n\nconflict with the statute” and such agreement “preempts any contrary statute,\n\nexecutive order, local ordinance, or rule adopted by the state or a political\n\nsubdivision or agent of the state”).\n\n      We conclude that, as a matter of law, the Trustees’ alleged violation of the\n\nMeet and Confer Agreement does not serve as a valid basis for an ultra vires claim.\n\nWe hold that Appellants have not alleged claims conferring subject-matter\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\fjurisdiction on the trial court enabling it to render the declaratory or injunctive\n\nrelief sought. See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 159.\n\n      3.     Non-Compliance with Tax Code\n\n      In the trial court, Plaintiffs alleged that the Trustees committed an ultra vires\n\nact by “adopting a construction of Article 6243h and the Pension Plan that fails to\n\nmeet the qualification requirements of [s]ection 401, Internal Revenue Code . . . as\n\nrequired by [s]ection 2(x) of Article 6243h.” They requested the trial court to\n\nenjoin “the ultra vires action of adopting an illegal amendment to the Pension Plan\n\nthat disqualifies the Pension Plan under the Internal Revenue Code.”\n\n      Article 6243h, section 3(m) provides, “It is intended that this Act be\n\nconstrued and administered in a manner so that the pension system’s benefit plan\n\nwill be considered a qualified plan under Section 401(a), Internal Revenue Code of\n\n1986, as amended.” TEX. CIV. REV. STAT. ANN. art. 6243h, § 3(m). The statute\n\nalso provides that any construction of the act by the pension board “must meet the\n\nqualification requirements established under [Internal Revenue Code Section\n\n401(a)].” See id. § 2(x)(2).\n\n      To qualify as a “governmental plan” under 26 U.S.C. § 401(a), the plan must\n\nbe established and maintained for the employees of a political subdivision of a\n\nstate or its agencies or instrumentalities. See 26 U.S.C. § 414(d). Appellants\n\nacknowledge that the pension board has determined that Plaintiffs are government\n\n                                         35\n\femployees for pension purposes, despite their transfer to CCSI. Appellants assert,\n\nhowever, that because such decision was incorrect, the Trustees have violated\n\nArticle 6243h’s provisions requiring compliance as an IRS qualified plan. It\n\nfollows that a determination of whether the Trustees have violated the act’s\n\nprovisions, requiring compliance as an IRS qualified plan, would necessarily first\n\nrequire a court to conduct a substantive evaluation of the correctness of the pension\n\nboard’s discretionary and statutorily authorized decisions to supplement the\n\ndefinition of employee and to treat Plaintiffs as City employees for pension\n\npurposes.\n\n      As discussed supra, Article 6243h authorized the Trustees to make those\n\ndeterminations. Because they were authorized, these determinations were not ultra\n\nvires acts but were discretionary decisions made by the pension board.             The\n\nsubstantive correctness of those discretionary determinations is not subject to\n\njudicial review. See Ferrell, 248 S.W.3d at 158 (“There is no right to judicial\n\nreview of an administrative order unless a statute explicitly provides that\n\nright . . . .”). As a result, the trial court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to\n\nevaluate whether the Trustees committed an ultra vires act by “adopting a\n\nconstruction of Article 6243h and the Pension Plan that fails to meet the\n\nqualification requirements of Section 401, Internal Revenue Code.”\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\f      We hold that the trial court is without jurisdiction to grant the declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief sought by Appellants based on the pleaded ultra vires claims.\n\nThe trial court did not err when it granted the Trustees’ plea to the jurisdiction on\n\nthose claims.\n\n      We overrule the City’s sole issue. We overrule Plaintiffs’ second, third,\n\nfourth, and ninth issues.\n\n                               Constitutional Claims\n\n      In their fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth issues, Plaintiffs assert that the trial\n\ncourt erred by granting the plea to the jurisdiction with respect to their claims\n\nregarding violations of their state equal-protection and due-course-of-law rights.\n\nHMEPS asserts that it retains its immunity from suit for these claims because, as\n\npled, the claims are not viable.\n\nA.    Equal-Protection Claim\n\n      In their amended petition, Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano\n\nalleged as follows in support of their equal protection claim:\n\n      The Texas Constitution provides that all people “have equal rights,\n      and no man, or set of men, is entitled to exclusive separate public\n      emoluments, or privileges, but in consideration of public services.”\n      TEX. CONST. art. 1, § 3. HMEPS is treating [Plaintiffs Klumb,\n      McClelland, and Montejano] differently than other individuals such as\n      those who work for Houston Zoo, Inc., Houston READ Commission,\n      Miller Outdoor Theater Advisory Board, Inc., and Houston Parks\n      Board, who have left employment with the City to work with separate\n      legal entities that had business relationships with the City [and are\n      now nonetheless receiving retirement benefits from HMEPS]. As a\n                                          37\n\f      result of the disparate treatment, [Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and\n      Montejano] have been damaged.\n\n      We analyze equal-protection challenges asserted under the state constitution\n\nin the same manner as those claims asserted under the federal constitution.

Due Course of Law\n\n        With respect to their due course of law claim, Plaintiffs allege as follows:\n\n        The Texas Constitution also provides that “[n]o citizen of this State\n        shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or\n        in any manner disfranchised, except by the course of the law of the\n        land.” TEX. CONST. art. l, § 19. Here, the [Plaintiffs Klumb,\n        McClelland, and Montejano] have a right to receive payments from\n        their vested retirement accounts upon their termination of employment\n        with the City. HMEPS refuses and continues to refuse to pay the\n        benefits to which the [Plaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano]\n        have a vested right to receive. This is an unlawful taking in violation\n        of Due Course of Law.\n                                           40\n\f         Plaintiffs have a right to contribute their salaries only to organizations\n         and entities of which they are a part. HMEPS is attempting to seize\n         five percent of their salaries. This is an unlawful taking in violation of\n         Due Course of Law.\n\n         HMEPS contends that Plaintiffs do not have a vested property interest at\n\nstake.     Plaintiffs’ due-course-of-law claims require the existence of such a\n\nprotected right. See Combs v.

If HMEPS is correct in its assertion that Plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to allege a vested property interest, Plaintiffs’ due-course-of-law claims have\n\nno merit, and the trial court properly granted HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction\n\nregarding those claims. See id.\n\n         According to the amended petition, the first property interest at stake for\n\nPlaintiffs Klumb, McClelland, and Montejano is payment from their retirement\n\naccounts on their termination of employment with the City. HMEPS correctly\n\npoints out that a pensioner in a statutory pension plan does not have a vested right\n\nto his pension. Reames v. Police Officers’ Pension Bd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2413976\"><a href=\"/opinion/2413976/reames-v-police-officerspension-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">628</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632\n\n(Tex.

App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1992, writ denied).         Here, Plaintiffs Klumb,\n\nMcClelland, and Montejano have no vested property right in the retirement\n\nbenefits at issue. The amended petition affirmatively negates the existence of\n\njurisdiction over their due-course-of-law claim asserted in relation to those\n\nbenefits. See Combs, 311 S.W.3d at 94.\n\n      Plaintiffs also allege that HMEPS “is attempting to seize five percent of their\n\nsalaries” as monthly contributions into the pension fund. They assert that they\n\nhave a property right in these contributions. HMEPS explains that the City, not the\n\nemployees, pay contributions to HMEPS. HMEPS cites the Benefits Handbook,\n\nwhich was offered by Plaintiffs into evidence.        The handbook explains that\n\nHMEPS members do not pay employee contributions to HMEPS. Rather, the City\n\npays the contribution directly from its treasury to HMEPS. This is also reflected in\n\nArticle 6243h, section 8(c), which provides that “the city shall pay the pickup\n\ncontributions to the pension system from the same source of funds that is used for\n\npaying salaries to the members.        The pickup contributions are in lieu of\n\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fcontributions [by the members].” TEX. REV. CIV. STAT. art. 6243h, § 8(c) (Vernon\n\n2010).\n\n      HMEPS also points to Devon v. City of San Antonio, which explains as\n\nfollows:\n\n      [D]eductions withheld from [public employees’] wages and paid into\n      the pension fund never belonged to [them], but remained public\n      money used for a public purpose. They were not first segregated from\n      the public funds so as to become [the employees’] private property\n      and then paid into the pension fund; rather, the deductions were “set\n      aside from one public fund and turned over to another” and are no less\n      public money after the payment into the pension fund than before.\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1656294\"><a href=\"/opinion/1656294/devon-v-city-of-san-antonio/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600 (Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1969, writ ref’d) (quoting Trammell,\n\n101 S.W.2d at 1013).\n\n      We agree with HMEPS that the jurisdictional evidence shows, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that the Plaintiffs do not have a property right in the contributions made to the\n\npension system. See id.; see also Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226–28. Accordingly,\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to assert a viable due-course-of law claim, and HMEPS\n\nretains its immunity from suit regarding that claim. We hold that the trial court\n\nproperly granted HMEPS’s plea to the jurisdiction on Plaintiffs’ due-course-of law\n\nclaims.\n\n      We overrule Plaintiffs’ fifth and sixth issues. We also overrule Plaintiffs’\n\nfirst issue, generally challenging the granting of the plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                           43\n\f                             Motion for Continuance\n\n      In their tenth issue, Plaintiffs assert that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it denied their motion for continuance. Plaintiffs sought a continuance of the\n\nhearing on the plea to the jurisdiction to permit them to conduct additional\n\njurisdictional discovery.\n\n      We apply an abuse-of-discretion standard of review to a trial court’s\n\ndecision on whether to grant a continuance of a plea-to-the-jurisdiction hearing to\n\nallow additional discovery. Garcia v. Kubosh, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2012, no pet.). An appellate court may reverse for abuse of\n\ndiscretion only if it finds that the trial court’s decision was so arbitrary and\n\nunreasonable as to amount to a clear and prejudicial error of law. Joe v. Two\n\nThirty Nine Joint Venture, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894601\"><a href=\"/opinion/894601/joe-v-two-thirty-nine-joint-venture/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 162 (Tex. 2004). There is no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in a case in which the trial court could reasonably conclude that\n\nadditional discovery was unnecessary and irrelevant to the legal issues in the case.\n\nId. This is such a case.\n\n      As seen in the discussion of the preceding issues, the determination of the\n\njurisdictional issues in this case is based on the statutory language, the allegations\n\nin Plaintiffs’ pleadings, and basic documents, such as the minutes from the board\n\nmeetings, the Resolution, the Pension Plan Document, and the Meet and Confer\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fAgreement.     The Benefits Handbook, mentioned with respect to determining\n\nPlaintiffs’ due-course-of-law claim, was offered by Plaintiffs.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that they sought a continuance so that they could depose\n\neach Trustee about his or her affidavit in which each testified that the board had\n\ninterpreted, not amended, the definition of employee. Plaintiffs also indicate that\n\nthey wanted a continuance to seek documents and information relating to the\n\nTrustees’ decision-making process with respect to interpreting the definition.\n\nHowever, as discussed supra, the subjective views of the board members are not\n\nmaterial to the legal determination of whether they acted ultra vires in\n\ncontravention of the statute.\n\n      Plaintiffs further indicate that they desired to conduct discovery pertaining to\n\nwhether employees of other legal entities are similarly situated to them.           As\n\ndiscussed, Plaintiffs’ equal-protection claim fails on the rational-basis analysis\n\nwithout considering whether other persons receiving retirement benefits are\n\nsimilarly situated.\n\n      None of the discovery mentioned by Plaintiffs could have raised a fact issue\n\nmaterial to the determination of the jurisdictional plea. See id. Plaintiffs failed to\n\ndemonstrate that additional discovery was necessary. See id. We hold that the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for continuance.\n\n      We overrule Plaintiffs’ tenth issue.\n\n                                         45\n\f                                    Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the trial court granting HMEPS’s and the\n\nTrustees’ plea to the jurisdiction and dismissing Appellants’ claims.\n\n\n\n\n                                       Laura Carter Higley\n                                       Justice\n\nPanel consists of Chief Justice Radack and Justices Higley and Brown.\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f</pre>",
