Barronelle Stutzman owns\n\nand operates a place of public accommodation in our state: Arlene's Flowers Inc.\n\nStutzman and her public business, Arlene's Flowers and Gifts, refused to sell\n\nwedding flowers to Robert Ingersoll because his betrothed, Curt Freed, is a man.\n\nThe State and the couple sued, each alleging violations of the WLAD and the\n\nConsumer Protection Act (CPA), ch. 19.86 RCW.             Stutzman defended on the\n\ngrounds that the WLAD and CPA do not apply to her conduct and that, if they do,\n\nthose statutes violate her state and federal constitutional rights to free speech, free\n\nexercise, and free association.\n\n      The Benton County Superior Court granted summary judgment to the State\n\nand the couple, rejecting all of Stutzman's claims. We granted review and now\n\naffirm.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n      In 2004, Ingersoll and Freed began a committed, romantic relationship. In\n\n2012, our state legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6239, which\n\nrecognized equal civil marriage rights for same-sex couples. LAWS OF 2012, ch. 3,\n\n§ 1. Freed proposed marriage to Ingersoll that same year. The two intended to marry\n\non their ninth anniversary, in September 2013, and were \"excited about organizing\n\n[their] wedding.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 350. Their plans included inviting \"[a]\n\n\n                                           2\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nhundred plus\" guests to celebrate with them at Bella Fiori Gardens, complete with a\n\ndinner or reception, a photographer, a caterer, a wedding cake, and flowers. Id. at\n\n1775-77.\n\n      By the time he and Freed became engaged, Ingersoll had been a customer at\n\nArlene's Flowers for at least nine years, purchasing numerous floral arrangements\n\nfrom Stutzman and spending an estimated several thousand dollars at her shop.\n\nStutzman is the owner and president of Arlene's Flowers.             She employs\n\napproximately 10 people, depending on the season, including three floral designers,\n\none of whom is herself. Stutzman knew that Ingersoll is gay and that he had been in\n\na relationship with Freed for several years. The two men considered Arlene's\n\nFlowers to be \"[their] florist.\" Id. at 350.\n\n      Stutzman is an active member of the Southern Baptist church.             It is\n\nuncontested that her sincerely held religious beliefs include a belief that marriage\n\ncan exist only between one man and one woman.\n\n      On February 28, 2013, Ingersoll went to Arlene's Flowers on his way home\n\nfrom work, hoping to talk to Stutzman about purchasing flowers for his upcoming\n\nwedding. Ingersoll told an Arlene's Flowers employee that he was engaged to marry\n\nFreed and that they wanted Arlene's Flowers to provide the flowers for their\n\nwedding. The employee informed Ingersoll that Stutzman was not at the shop and\n\n\n                                               3\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nthat he would need to speak directly with her. The next day, Ingersoll returned to\n\nspeak with Ms. Stutzman. At that time, Stutzman told Ingersoll that she would be\n\nunable to do the flowers for his wedding because of her religious beliefs, specifically,\n\nbecause of\"her relationship with Jesus Christ.\" Id. at 155, 351, 1741-42, 1744-45,\n\n1763. Ingersoll did not have a chance to specify what kind of flowers or floral\n\narrangements he was seeking before Stutzman told him that she would not serve\n\nhim. They also did not discuss whether Stutzman would be asked to bring the\n\narrangements to the wedding location or whether the flowers would be picked up\n\nfrom her shop.\n\n       Stutzman asserts that she gave Ingersoll the name of other florists who might\n\nbe willing to serve him, and that the two hugged before Ingersoll left her store.\n\nIngersoll maintains that he walked away from that conversation \"feeling very hurt\n\nand upset emotionally.\" Id. at 1743.\n\n       Early the next morning, after a sleepless night, Freed posted a status update\n\non his personal Facebook feed regarding Stutzman's refusal to sell him wedding\n\nflowers. The update observed, without specifically naming Arlene's Flowers, that\n\nthe couple's \"favorite Richland Lee Boulevard flower shop\" had declined to provide\n\nflowers for their wedding on religious grounds, and noted that Freed felt \"so deeply\n\noffended that apparently our business is no longer good business,\" because \"[his]\n\n\n                                           4\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nloved one [did not fit] within their personal beliefs.\" Id. at 1262. This message was\n\napparently widely circulated, though Ingersoll testified that their Facebook settings\n\nwere such that the message was \"only intended for our friends and family.\" Id. at\n\n1760, 1785. Eventually, the story drew the attention of numerous media outlets.\n\n      As a result of the \"emotional toll\" Stutzman's refusal took on Freed and\n\nIngersoll, they \"lost enthusiasm for a large ceremony\" as initially imagined. Id. at\n\n1490. In fact, the two \"stopped planning for a wedding in September 2013 because\n\n[they] feared being denied service by other wedding vendors.\" I d. at 351. The\n\ncouple also feared that in light of increasing public attention-some of which caused\n\nthem to be concerned for their own safety-as well as then-ongoing litigation, a\n\nlarger wedding might require a security presence or attract protesters, such as the\n\nWestboro Baptist group.     So they were married on July 21, 2013, in a modest\n\nceremony at their home. There were 11 people in attendance. For the occasion,\n\nFreed and Ingersoll purchased one bouquet of flowers from a different florist and\n\nboutonnieres from their friend. When word of this story got out in the media, a\n\nhandful of florists offered to provide their wedding flowers free of charge.\n\n      Stutzman also received a great deal of attention from the publicity surrounding\n\nthis case, including threats to her business and other unkind messages.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      Prior to Ingersoll's request, Arlene's Flowers had never had a request to\n\nprovide flowers for a same-sex wedding, and the only time Stutzman has ever\n\nrefused to serve a customer is when Ingersoll and Freed asked her to provide flowers\n\nfor their wedding. The decision not to serve Ingersoll was made strictly by Stutzman\n\nand her husband. After Ingersoll's and Freed's request, Stutzman developed an\n\n\"unwritten policy\" for Arlene's Flowers that they \"don't take same sex marriages.\"\n\nId. at 120. Stutzman states that the only reason for this policy is her conviction that\n\n\"biblically marriage is between a man and a woman.\" Id. at 120-21. Aside from\n\nIngersoll and Freed, she has served gay and lesbian customers in the past for other,\n\nnon-wedding-related flower orders.\n\n      Stutzman maintains that she would not sell Ingersoll any arranged flowers for\n\nhis wedding, even if he were asking her only to replicate a prearranged bouquet from\n\na picture book of sample arrangements. She believes that participating, or allowing\n\nany employee of her store to participate, in a same-sex wedding by providing custom\n\nfloral arrangements and related customer service is tantamount to endorsing\n\nmarriage equality for same-sex couples. She draws a distinction between creating\n\nfloral arrangements--even those designed by someone else-and selling bulk\n\nflowers and \"raw materials,\" which she would be happy to do for Ingersoll and\n\nFreed. I d. at 546-4 7. Stutzman believes that to create floral arrangements is to use\n\n\n                                           6\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nher \"imagination and artistic skill to intimately participate in a same-sex wedding\n\nceremony.\" Id. at 547. However, Stutzman aclmowledged that selling flowers for\n\nan atheistic or Muslim wedding would not be tantamount to endorsing those systems\n\nof belief.\n\n       By Stutzman's best estimate, approximately three percent of her business\n\ncomes from weddings. Stutzman is not currently providing any wedding floral\n\nservices (other than for members of her immediate family) during the pendency of\n\nthis case.\n\n                             PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       After the State became aware of Stutzman's refusal to sell flowers to Ingersoll\n\nand Freed, the Attorney General's Office sent Stutzman a letter. It sought her\n\nagreement to stop discriminating against customers on the basis of their sexual\n\norientation and noted that doing so would prevent further formal action or costs\n\nagainst her. The letter asked her to sign an \"Assurance of Discontinuance,\" which\n\nstated that she would no longer discriminate in the provision of wedding floral\n\nservices. Stutzman refused to sign the letter.\n\n       As a result, the State filed a complaint for injunctive and other relief under the\n\nCPA and WLAD against both Stutzman and Arlene's Flowers, in Benton County\n\nSuperior Court on April 9, 2013. Stutzman filed an answer on May 16, 2013,\n\n\n                                            7\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nasserting, among other defenses, that her refusal to furnish Ingersoll with wedding\n\nservices was protected by the state and federal constitutions' free exercise, free\n\nspeech, and freedom of association guaranties. Ingersoll and Freed filed a private\n\nlawsuit against Arlene's Flowers and Stutzman on April 18, 2013, which the trial\n\ncourt consolidated with the State's case on July 24, 2013. The parties filed various\n\ncross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ultimately entered judgment\n\nfor the plaintiffs in both cases, awarding permanent injunctive relief, as well as\n\nmonetary damages for Ingersoll and Freed to cover actual damages, attorneys' fees,\n\nand costs, and finding Stutzman personally liable.\n\n      When it granted the plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment, the trial court\n\nmade seven rulings that are at issue in this appeal. First, it issued two purely\n\nstatutory rulings: ( 1) that Stutzman violated the WLAD' s public accommodations\n\nprovision (RCW 49.60.215(1)) and the CPA (see RCW 19.86.020 and RCW\n\n49.60.030) by refusing to sell floral services for same-sex weddings and (2) that both\n\nStutzman (personally) and Arlene's Flowers (the corporate defendant) were liable\n\nfor these violations. CP at 2566-600. Next, the court made five constitutional\n\nrulings. It concluded that the application of the WLAD's public accommodations\n\nprovision to Stutzman in this case ( 1) did not violate Stutzman's right to free speech\n\nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 5\n\n\n                                           8\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nof the Washington Constitution, (2) did not violate Stutzman's right to religious free\n\nexercise under the First Amendment, (3) did not violate her right to free association\n\nunder the First Amendment, (4) did not violate First Amendment protections under\n\nthe hybrid rights doctrine, and (5) did not violate Stutzman's right to religious free\n\nexercise under article I, section 11 of the Washington Constitution. !d. at 2601-60.\n\n      Stutzman appealed directly to this court, assigning error to all seven of those\n\nrulings. We granted direct review. Order, Ingersoll v. Arlene Js Flowers, No. 91615-\n\n2 (Wash. Mar. 2, 2016). With respect to most of the claims, Stutzman and Arlene's\n\nFlowers make identical arguments-in other words, Stutzman asserts that both she\n\nand her corporation enjoy identical rights of free speech, free exercise, and free\n\nassociation. It is only with respect to the CPA claim that Stutzman asserts a separate\n\ndefense: she argues that even if Arlene's Flowers is liable for the CPA violation, she\n\ncannot be personally liable for a violation of that statute.\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n      As noted above, this case presents both statutory and constitutional questions.\n\nBoth are reviewed de novo. Williams v. Tilaye, 174 Wn.2d 57, 61, 272 P.3d 235\n\n(2012) (\"[s]tatutory interpretation is a question of law reviewed de novo\" (citing\n\nState v. Wentz, 149 Wn.2d 342, 346, 68 P.3d 282 (2003))); Hale v. Wellpinit Sch.\n\nDist.

Jones, 159 Wn.2d 231, 237,\n\n149 P.3d 636 (2006))).\n\n      I.      Stutzman's Refusal To Provide Custom Floral Arrangements for a\n              Same-Sex Wedding Violated the WLAD's Prohibition on\n              Discrimination in Public Accommodations, RCW 49.60.215\n\n      Stutzman's first statutory argument implicates the WLAD, chapter 49.60\n\nRCW. The trial court ruled that Stutzman violated RCW 49.60.215, which prohibits\n\ndiscrimination in the realm of public accommodations. That statute provides:\n\n      (1)     It shall be an unfair practice for any person or the person's agent\n      or employee to commit an act which directly or indirectly results in any\n      distinction, restriction, or discrimination, or the requiring of any person\n      to pay a larger sum than the uniform rates charged other persons, or the\n      refusing or withholding from any person the admission, patronage,\n      custom, presence, frequenting, dwelling, staying, or lodging in any\n      place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement,\n      except for conditions and limitations established by law and applicable\n      to all persons, regardless of ... sexual orientation ....\n\nRCW 49.60.215. The protected class status of \"sexual orientation\" was added to\n\nthis provision in 2006. LAws OF 2006, ch. 4, § 13.\n\n      The WLAD defines places of public accommodation to include places\n\nmaintained \"for the sale of goods, merchandise, services, or personal property, or\n\nfor the rendering of personal services . . . . \"     RCW 49.60.040(2).        Protected\n\nindividuals are guaranteed \"[t]he right to the full enjoyment of any of the\n\naccommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges\" of such places.              RCW\n\n                                          10\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n49.60.030(1)(b). Additionally, the WLAD states that \"[t]he right to be free from\n\ndiscrimination because of . .. sexual orientation ... is recognized as and declared to\n\nbe a civil right,\" RCW 49.60.030(1) (emphasis added).          The WLAD prohibits\n\ndiscrimination on the different basis of \"marital status\" in the employment context,\n\nbut not in the context of public accommodations. Compare RCW 49.60.180 (listing\n\n\"marital status\" as a protected class in section governing unfair practices of\n\nemployers) with RCW 49.60.215 (omitting marital status from analogous public\n\naccommodations statute).\n\n      RCW 49.60.030(2) authorizes private plaintiffs to bring suit for violations of\n\nthe WLAD. To make out a prima facie case under the WLAD for discrimination in\n\nthe public accommodations context, the plaintiff must establish four elements: (1)\n\nthat the plaintiff is a member of a protected class, RCW 49.60.030(1); (2) that the\n\ndefendant is a place of public accommodation, RCW 49.60.215; (3) that the\n\ndefendant discriminated against the plaintiff, whether directly or indirectly, id.; and\n\n(4) that the discrimination occurred \"because of' the plaintiffs status or, in other\n\nwords, that the protected status was a substantial factor causing the discrimination,\n\nRCW 49.60.030. See also Fell v. Spokane Transit Auth., 128 Wn.2d 618, 637, 911\n\nP .2d 1319 ( 1996) (setting forth elements of prima facie case for disability\n\ndiscrimination under RCW 49.60.215).\n\n\n                                          11\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n       Stutzman contests only the last element: she contends that she did not\n\ndiscriminate against Ingersoll \"because of' his protected class status under the\n\nWLAD. See Br. of Appellants at 19-21. 1 She offers three arguments in support of\n\nthis interpretation of the statute.\n\n       First, Stutzman argues that if she discriminated against Ingersoll, it was on the\n\nbasis of his \"marital status,\" not his \"sexual orientation.\" Br. of Appellants at 19-\n\n21.   Second, she argues that the legislature could not have intended the 2006\n\namendments to protect people seeking same-sex wedding services since same-sex\n\nmarriages were \"illegal\" in Washington in 2006. Id. at 15-17. She points out that\n\nwhen the legislature amended the public accommodations provisions of the WLAD\n\nin 2006, it also added language stating that the chapter \"shall not be construed to\n\nendorse any specific belief, practice, behavior, or orientation,\" and affirming that the\n\naddition \"shall not be constnled to modify or supersede state law relating to\n\nmarriage.\" Id. at 17-18, 15 (quoting LAWS        OF 2006,   ch. 4, § 2 (codified at RCW\n\n49.60.020)). Third, Stutzman argues that because the WLAD protects both sexual\n\n\n\n       1\n         No one disputes that Ingersoll and Freed are gay men who sought to marry in\nrecognition of their nearly nine-year committed relationship. And Stutzman admits that\nshe is the \"sole owner and operator of Arlene's Flowers, Inc.,\" CP at 535, which is \"a\nWashington for-profit corporation engaged in the sale of goods and services, including\nflowers for weddings,\" to the public. Id. at 2, 7-8. Furthermore, Stutzman confirms that\nshe declined to do the flowers for Ingersoll's wedding because of her religious convictions.\n\n                                            12\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\norientation and religion, it requires that courts balance those rights when they\n\nconflict. 2 These arguments fail.\n\n              A. By refusing to provide services for a same-sex wedding, Stutzman\n                 discriminated on the basis of \"sexual orientation\" under the WLAD\n\n      Stutzman argues that the WLAD distinguishes between discrimination on the\n\nbasis of \"sexual orientation\"-which the statute prohibits-and discrimination\n\nagainst those who marry members of the same sex. But numerous courts-including\n\nour own-have rejected this kind of status/conduct distinction in cases involving\n\nstatutory and constitutional claims of discrimination. E.g., Hegwine v. Longview\n\nFibre Co.) Inc., 162 Wn.2d 340, 349, 172 P.3d 688 (2007) (\"under the plain language\n\nof the WLAD and its interpretative regulations, pregnancy related employment\n\ndiscrimination claims are matters of sex discrimination\"); Elane Photography) LLC\n\nv. Willock, 2013-NMSC-040, 309 P.3d 53 (2013) (rejecting argument identical to\n\nStutzman's, in context ofNew Mexico's Human Rights Act (NMHRA), N.M. STAT.\n\nANN.§§ 28-1-1 to 28-1-13) 3 ; Christian Legal Soc)y Chapter ofUniv. ofCal. v.\n\n\n       2\n          Stutzman also argues that by compelling her to furnish flowers for a same-sex\nmarriage ceremony, the State \"endorses\" same-sex marriages and also requires her to\n\"endorse\" them.

This is related to her argument in the opening brief that because\nshe generally lacks animus towards gay people, and because her refusal to provide service\nto Mr. Ingersoll was motivated by religious beliefs, she cannot be said to have\ndiscriminated \"because of' sexual orientation as required by the WLAD. See Br. of\nAppellants at 19-21. From Bray, Stutzman concludes that her decision to decline Mr.\nIngersoll's \"artistic commission\" was acceptable because it was \"reasonable\" and she bore\n\"no underlying animus\" towards gay people in general. Reply Br. of Appellants at 40.\nHowever, Bray dealt with a question of statutory interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3),\nwhich has been interpreted to require a showing of animus. See Bray, 506 U.S. at 267-68;\nGriffin, 403 U.S. at 102. In contrast, we have already addressed this question of an animus\nrequirement with regards to the WLAD and have held that it contains no such requirement\n(see discussion below).\n\n       5  See also Blackburn v.

This is consistent\n\nwith the language of the WLAD itself, which, as respondents observe, states that it\n\nis to be construed liberally, RCW 49.60.020; that all people, regardless of sexual\n\norientation are to have ''full enjoyment of any of the accommodations, advantages,\n\nfacilities, or privileges\" of any place of public accommodation, RCW 49.60.030\n\n(emphasis added); and that all discriminatory acts, including any act \"which directly\n\nor indirectly results in any distinction, restriction, or discrimination\" based on a\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         In response to the authority cited here, Stutzman cites two cases for the proposition\nthat other courts have drawn a distinction between conduct and status. See Reply Br. of\nAppellants at 36-37. She draws our attention to two trial court decisions from Kentucky\nand Virginia. ld.\n\n                                             16\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nperson's sexual orientation is an unfair practice in violation of the WLAD, RCW\n\n49.60.215 (emphasis added).\n\n              B. There is no same-sex wedding exception to the WLAD's public\n                 accommodation provision, RCW 49.60.215\n\n      For the reasons given in Section I.A above, the plain language of RCW\n\n49.60.215 prohibits Stutzman's refusal to provide same-sex wedding services to\n\nIngersoll; such refusal constitutes discrimination on the basis of\"sexual orientation,\"\n\nin violation ofRCW 49.60.215. The same analysis applies to her corporation.\n\n      Stutzman asks us to read an implied same-sex wedding exception into this\n\nstatute. She argues that the legislature could not have intended to require equal\n\naccess to public accommodations for same-sex wedding services because when it\n\namended RCW 49.60.215 to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, same-sex\n\nmarriage was \"illegal\" in Washington.\n\n      We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the WLAD already contains\n\nan express exemption to RCW 49.60.215 for \"religious organization[s]\" 7 that object\n\nto providing public accommodations for same-sex weddings. LAWS OF 2012, ch. 3,\n\n\n      7 This exemption does not extend to Arlene's Flowers, which does not meet the\nWLAD' s definition of a \"religious organization.\" I d. at § 1(7)(b) (defining \"religious\norganization\" to include \"entities whose principal purpose is the study, practice, or\nadvancement of religion,\" such as \"churches, mosques, synagogues, temples,\" etc.).\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n§ 1(5) (\"[n]o religious organization is required to provide accommodations,\n\nfacilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the solemnization or\n\ncelebration of a marriage\"). If the WLAD already excluded same-sex wedding\n\nservices from the public accommodations covered under RCW 49.60.215, this\n\nexemption would be superfluous. We interpret statutes to avoid such superfluity\n\nwhenever possible. Rivardv. State, 168 Wn.2d 775,783,231 P.3d 186 (2010) (in\n\ngiving meaning to ambiguous statutory provisions, \"we interpret a statute to give\n\neffect to all language, so as to render no portion meaningless or superfluous\").\n\n      Second, for purposes of the analysis Stutzman would like us to adopt, same-\n\nsex marriage has never been \"illegal\" in Washington. Stutzman cites our decision\n\nin Waggoner v. Ace Hardware Corp., 134 Wn.2d 748, 750, 953 P.2d 88 (1998),\n\nwhich rejected a claim of marital status discrimination by two people terminated\n\nfrom their jobs for cohabiting in contravention of their workplace antinepotism\n\npolicy. Waggoner argued that \"cohabitation\" fit within the meaning of the term\n\n\"marital status.\"    In examining this question of statutory interpretation, we\n\ndetermined that the plain meaning of the word \"marital\"-that is, pertaining to \"the\n\nstatus of being married, separated, divorced, or widowed\"-was sufficient to resolve\n\nthe question against petitioners. Id. at 753. We thus rejected Waggoner's argument\n\nbecause \"[ w]e presume legislative consistency when called upon to construe\n\n\n                                          18\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nstatutory enactments or new amendments to old ones\" and our legislature had\n\ncriminalized cohabitation prior to protecting marital status under the WLAD. Id. at\n\n754. Of significance here, we noted that cohabitation remained a crime for a full\n\nthree years after marital status was included as a protected status, and observed that\n\n\"[i]t would be most anomalous for the Legislature to criminalize and protect the\n\nsame conduct at the same time.\" !d. (emphasis added). Stutzman argues that we\n\nshould treat same-sex marriage the same way and hold that the legislature could not\n\npossibly have intended to protect that practice when it protected sexual orientation\n\nas a status.\n\n       But Stutzman's reliance on Waggoner is misplaced. Washington's Defense\n\nof Marriage Act did not criminalize same-sex marriage. Former RCW 9.79.120\n\n(1973), repealed by LAWS OF 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, § 9A.92.010(211). Rather,\n\nit codified, as a matter of state law, that the only legally recognized marriages in the\n\nState of Washington were those between a man and a woman. See LAWS            OF   1998,\n\nch. 1, § 2 (\"It is the intent of the legislature ... to establish public policy against\n\nsame-sex marriage in statutory law that clearly and definitively declares same-sex\n\nmarriages will not be recognized in Washington\"). Former RCW 26.04.010 (1998)\n\nenacted no criminal penalties for attempts by two individuals of the same sex to wed;\n\nthose individuals would simply not have had a valid \"marriage\" under Washington\n\n\n                                           19\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nlaw. See LAWS OF 1998, ch. 1, § 3. Former RCW 9.79.120, on the other hand,\n\nspecified that cohabitation was \"a gross misdemeanor.\" Waggoner, 134 Wn.2d at\n\n754 n.4. Our reasoning in Waggoner turned on the presence of a criminal statute\n\ntargeting the conduct at issue, which is absent here.\n\n      We hold that there is no same-sex wedding exception to the WLAD's public\n\naccommodations provisions.\n\n              C. The WLAD contains no mandate to balance religious rights against\n                 the rights of protected class members\n\n      In her final statutory argument regarding the WLAD, Stutzman contends that\n\nthe superior court erred by failing to balance her right to religious free exercise\n\nagainst Ingersoll's right to equal service. Stutzman argues that because the WLAD\n\nalso protects patrons of public accommodations from discrimination based on\n\n\"creed,\" RCW 49.60.030(1), and because this court has recognized that the WLAD\n\n\"sets forth a nonexclusive list of rights,\" Marquis v. City ofSpokane, 130 Wn.2d 97,\n\n107, 922 P.2d 43 (1996), the statute actually grants conflicting rights.      As a\n\nconsequence, she argues, courts should conduct a balancing inquiry \"on a case-by-\n\ncase basis,\" Reply Br. of Appellants at 43. She cites Seattle Times Co. v. Ishikawa,\n\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n97 Wn.2d 30, 37-39, 640 P.2d 716 (1982), for the rule that this court uses balancing\n\ntests to resolve claims of competing rights in other contexts. 8\n\n       But Stutzman cites no authority for her contention that the WLAD protects\n\nproprietors of public accommodations to the same extent as it protects their patrons,\n\nnor for her contention that a balancing test should be adopted for the WLAD. And,\n\nto the extent that Stutzman relies on Ishikawa, that case is inapposite: it dealt with\n\ntwo competing rights-the right to a fair trial and the right to open courts-both of\n\nwhich are constitutional, not statutory. 97 Wn.2d at 37.\n\n       When faced with a question of statutory interpretation, we \"'must not add\n\nwords where the legislature has chosen not to include them.\"' Lake v. Woodcreek\n\nHomeowners Ass 'n, 169 Wn.2d 516, 526, 243 P .3d 1283 (20 10) (quoting Rest. Dev.,\n\nInc. v. Cananwill, Inc., 150 Wn.2d 674, 682, 80 P.3d 598 (2003)).                     Here, the\n\n\n\n\n       8 Although    Stutzman refers to the balancing test set forth in Ishikawa, that is not the\ntest that she applies in her briefing. Instead, Stutzman articulates a three-part balancing\ninquiry that ( 1) prioritizes \"[ r]ights of express constitutional magnitude ... over other rights\nwhen they conflict,\" (2) evaluates whether infringement on the rights of the opposing party\nare narrowly tailored to protect the rights of the claimant, and (3) weighs the benefits and\nburdens on each party. Br. of Appellants at 23-24. In conducting this inquiry, Stutzman\nconcludes that her rights \"should take precedence\" here because they are of constitutional\nmagnitude, rather than derived from police power as are Ingersoll's; the exception for\nweddings only (as opposed to refusal to serve the gay community for any purpose) is\nnarrowly tailored to protect her religious rights; and she is more significantly burdened in\nthat she is forced to choose between losing business or violating her religious beliefs,\nwhereas \"Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Freed are able to obtain custom floral designs for their\nsame-sex wedding from nearby florists.\" Id.\n                                               21\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nlegislature has provided no indication in the text of the WLAD that it intended to\n\nimport a fact-specific, case-by-case, constitutional balancing test into the statute.\n\nMoreover, the plain terms of the WLAD's public accommodations provision-the\n\nstatute at issue here-protect patrons, not business owners. In other regulatory\n\ncontexts, this court and the United States Supreme Court have held that individuals\n\nwho engage in commerce necessarily accept some limitations on their conduct as a\n\nresult. See United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 261, 102 S. Ct. 1051, 71 L. Ed. 2d\n\n127 (1982) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (declining to extend Social Security\n\nexemption to Amish employers on religious grounds because \"[w]hen followers of\n\na particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they\n\naccept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be\n\nsuperimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity\");\n\nBacklund v. Bd. ofComm 'rs ofKing County Hasp. Dist. No.2, 106 Wn.2d 632, 648,\n\n724 P.2d 981 (1986) (rejecting religious grounds as valid basis for physician to\n\ndecline liability insurance because \"[t]hose who enter into a profession as a matter\n\nof choice, necessarily face regulation as to their own conduct\"); In re Marriage of\n\nDidier, 134 Wn. App. 490, 499, 140 P.3d 607 (2006).\n\n      Because it is inconsistent with the WLAD' s plain terms and unsupported by\n\nany precedent, we decline to adopt Stutzman's proposed balancing test. In sum,\n\n\n                                          22\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nStutzman's refusal to provide custom floral arrangements for a same-sex wedding\n\nviolated the WLAD's prohibition on discrimination in public accommodations. 9\n\n       II.    Stutzman Fails To Show That the WLAD, as Applied in This Case,\n              Violates Her State or Federal Constitutional Right to Free Speech\n\n      As noted above, Stutzman raises five constitutional challenges to the WLAD\n\nas applied to her. She is correct that if the State statute violated a constitutional right,\n\nthe constitutional right would certainly prevail. U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2 (federal\n\nconstitutional supremacy); Davis v. Cox, 183 Wn.2d 269, 294-95, 351 P.3d 862\n\n(2015) (state constitutional provision prevails over state statute to the contrary). We\n\ntherefore analyze each of Stutzman's constitutional defenses carefully.\n\n       The first of these defenses is a free speech challenge: Stutzman contends that\n\nher floral arrangements are artistic expressions protected by the state and federal\n\nconstitutions and that the WLAD impermissibly compels her to speak in favor of\n\nsame-sex marnage.\n\n              A. As applied to Stutzman in this case, the WLAD does not violate First\n                 Amendment speech protections\n\n       \"Free speech is revered as the 'Constitution's most majestic guarantee,'\n\ncentral to the preservation of all other rights.\" Pub. Disclosure Comm 'n v. 119 Vote\n\n\n       9\n        To the extent Stutzman argues that her religious free exercise rights supersede\nIngersoll's and Freed's statutory protections, we address that argument in the constitutional\nanalyses below.\n                                             23\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nNo! Comm., 135 Wn.2d 618, 624, 957 P.2d 691 (1998) (plurality opinion) (quoting\n\nNelson v. McClatchy Newspapers, Inc., 131 Wn.2d 523, 536,936 P.2d 1123 (1997)).\n\n\"The government may not prohibit the dissemination of ideas that it disfavors, nor\n\ncompel the endorsement of ideas that it approves.\" Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int'l Union,\n\nLocallOOO, _U.S._, 132 S. Ct. 2277, 2288, 183 L. Ed. 2d 281 (2012). Indeed,\n\nthe First Amendment protects even hate speech, provided it is not \"fighting words\"\n\nor a \"'true threat.\"' Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 359, 123 S. Ct. 1536, 155 L.\n\nEd. 2d 535 (2003) (quoting Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 708, 89 S. Ct. 1399,\n\n22 L. Ed. 2d 664 (1969) (per curiam)).\n\n      Stutzman argues that the WLAD, as applied to her in this case, violates First\n\nAmendment protections against \"compelled speech\" because it forces her to endorse\n\nsame-sex marriage. Br. of Appellants at 24-31. To succeed in this argument, she\n\nmust first demonstrate that the conduct at issue here-her commercial sale of floral\n\nwedding    arrangements-amounts to         \"expression\" protected by the First\n\nAmendment. Clarkv. Cmty.for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288,293 n.5, 104\n\nS. Ct. 3065, 82 L. Ed. 2d 221 (1984) (\"[I]t is the obligation ofthe person desiring to\n\nengage in assertedly expressive conduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment\n\neven applies. To hold otherwise would be to create a rule that all conduct is\n\npresumptively expressive.\")\n\n\n                                         24\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      She fails to meet this burden. The First Amendment's plain terms protect\n\n\"speech,\" not conduct. U.S. CONST. amend. I (\"Congress shall make no law ...\n\nabridging the freedom of speech.\"). But the line between speech and conduct in this\n\ncontext is not always clear. Stutzman contends that her floral arrangements are\n\n\"speech\" for purposes of First Amendment protections because they involve her\n\nartistic decisions. Br. of Appellants at 24. Relying on the dictionary definition of\n\n\"art,\" as well as expert testimony regarding her creativity and expressive style, she\n\nargues for a broad reading of protected speech that encompasses her \"unique\n\nexpression,\" crafted in \"petal, leaf, and loam.\" !d. at 25-26. Ingersoll and the State\n\ncounter that Stutzman's arrangements are simply one facet of conduct-selling\n\ngoods and services for weddings in the commercial marketplace-that does not\n\nimplicate First Amendment protections at all.\n\n      We agree that the regulated activity at issue in this case-Stutzman's sale of\n\nwedding floral arrangements-is not \"speech\" in a literal sense and is thus properly\n\ncharacterized as conduct. But that does not end our inquiry. The Supreme Court\n\nhas protected conduct as speech if two conditions are met: \"[(1)] [a]n intent to\n\nconvey a particularized message was present, and [(2)] in the surrounding\n\ncircumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be understood by\n\nthose who viewed it.\" Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405,410-11,94 S. Ct. 2727,\n\n\n                                          25\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n41 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1974) (per curiam). Recent cases have characterized this as an\n\ninquiry into whether the conduct at issue was \"inherently expressive.\" Rumsfeld v.\n\nForum for Acad. & Institutional Rights, Inc. (FAIR), 547 U.S. 47, 64, 126 S. Ct.\n\n1297, 164 L. Ed. 2d 156 (2006).\n\n      Stutzman's floral arrangements do not meet this definition. Certainly, she\n\nargues that she intends to communicate a message through her floral arrangements.\n\nBut the major contest is over whether Stutzman's intended communications actually\n\ncommunicated something to the public at large-whether her conduct was\n\n\"inherently expressive.\" Spence, 418 U.S. at 410-11; FAIR, 547 U.S. at 64. And\n\nher actions in creating floral arrangements for wedding ceremonies do not satisfy\n\nthis standard.\n\n      The leading case on the \"inherently expressive\" standard is FAIR.          The\n\nplaintiffs in FAIR-an association of law schools and faculty members-challenged\n\nthe constitutionality of a law that required higher education institutions to provide\n\nmilitary recruiters on campus with access to facilities and students that was at least\n\nequivalent to that of the most favorably treated nonmilitary recruiter. 547 U.S. at\n\n52, 55. The FAIR Court ruled that the law schools' conduct in denying military\n\nrecruiters most-favorable-recruiter access to students was not protected by the First\n\nAmendment because it was not \"inherently expressive.\" Id. at 66. It explained that\n\n\n                                         26\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nadditional speech would be required for an outside observer to understand that the\n\nschools' reason for denying military recruiters favorable access was to protest the\n\nmilitary's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Id.\n\n      Stutzman's refusal is analogous. The decision to either provide or refuse to\n\nprovide flowers for a wedding does not inherently express a message about that\n\nwedding.    As Stutzman acknowledged at deposition, providing flowers for a\n\nwedding between Muslims would not necessarily constitute an endorsement of\n\nIslam, nor would providing flowers for an atheist couple endorse atheism. Stutzman\n\nalso testified that she has previously declined wedding business on \"[m]ajor\n\nholidays, when we don't have the staff or if they want particular flowers that we\n\ncan't get in the time frame they need.\" CP at 120. Accordingly, an outside observer\n\nmay be left to wonder whether a wedding was declined for one of at least three\n\nreasons: a religious objection, insufficient staff, or insufficient stock.\n\n       Stutzman argues that FAIR is inapposite and that we should instead apply\n\nHurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, 515 U.S. 557,\n\n115 S. Ct. 2338, 132 L. Ed. 2d 487 (1995).                  Hurley held that a state\n\nantidiscrimination law could not be applied so as to require a private parade to\n\ninclude marchers displaying a gay pride message. Id. at 568. Stutzman claims\n\nHurley recognizes her First Amendment right \"to exclude a message [she] did not\n\n\n                                           27\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nlike from the communication [she] chose to make.\" Reply Br. of Appellants at 11\n\n(citing Hurley, 515 U.S. at 574). 10\n\n      Hurley is similar to this case m one respect: it involved a public\n\naccommodations law like the WLAD.II But the Massachusetts trial court had ruled\n\n\n\n       IO Stutzman relies on Redgrave v. Boston Symphony Orchestra, 855 F.2d 888 (1st\nCir. 1988), in which the Boston Symphony (BSO) refused to perform with Vanessa\nRed grave in light of her support of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Redgrave sued\nthe BSO for breach of contract and consequential damages in federal court. Redgrave v.\nBoston Symphony Orchestra, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 1189 (D. Mass. 1985), affirmingjudgment\nin part, vacated in part, 855 F.2d 888 (1st Cir. 1988). The First Amendment issue in that\ncase arose from the district court's concern that Red grave's novel theory of consequential\ndamages was sufficiently related to defamation cases so as to implicate First Amendment\nconcerns. !d. at 1201.\n       However, as the attorney general here notes, the First Circuit resolved that case on\nstatutory interpretation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, MASS. GEN. LAWS, ch. 12,\n§§ 11H~11J, not on First Amendment grounds. Att'y Gen.'s Resp. Br. at 26. In fact, the\ncourt ultimately chose to \"decline to reach the federal constitutional issues,\" given the\ncomplex interaction between First Amendment doctrine and state law, and saw \"no need\nto discuss the existence or content of a First Amendment right not to perform an artistic\nendeavor.\" 855 F.2d at 911. Accordingly, Stutzman's references are, at best, out~of~circuit\ndicta.\n\n       II Stutzman cites both Hurley and Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640,\n657, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d 554 (2000), as examples of cases in which the Supreme\nCourt vindicated First Amendment rights over state antidiscrimination public\naccommodations laws. In fact, both cases involved state courts applying public\naccommodations laws in unusually expansive ways, such that an individual, private,\nexpressive association of people fell under the law. Dale, 530 U.S. at 657 (New Jersey\nCourt \"went a step further\" from an already \"extremely broad\" public accommodations law\nin applying it \"to a private entity without even attempting to tie the term 'place' to a\nphysical location\"); Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (noting that Massachusetts trial court applied\na public accommodations law \"in a peculiar way\" to encompass a privately sponsored\nparade). This case is distinguishable because Arlene's Flowers is a paradigmatic public\naccommodation.\n                                            28\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nthat the parade itself was a place of public accommodation under state\n\nantidiscrimination law-a ruling that the Supreme Court called \"peculiar.\" 515 U.S.\n\nat 561-62, 573.     The Court noted that the parade's \"inherent expressiveness\"\n\ndistinguished it from the places traditionally subject to public accommodations\n\nlaws-places that provide \"publicly available goods, privileges, and services.\" Id.\n\nat 568-72. Hurley is therefore unavailing to Stutzman: her store is the kind of public\n\naccommodation that has traditionally been subject to antidiscrimination laws. See\n\nElane Photography, 309 P.3d at 68 (rejecting photographer's reliance on Hurley\n\nbecause state antidiscrimination law applies not to defendant's photographs but to\n\n\"its business decision not to offer its services to protected classes of people\";\n\nconcluding that \"[w]hile photography may be expressive, the operation of a\n\nphotography business is not\"). 12\n\n\n\n\n       12\n           The Supreme Court has drawn this distinction between expressive conduct and\ncommercial activity in the context of First Amendment freedom of association claims, and\nlikewise rejected the notion that the First Amendment precludes enforcement of\nantidiscrimination public accommodations laws in that context as well. E.g., Dale, 530\nU.S. at 657 (distinguishing between \"clearly commercial entities\" and \"membership\norganizations\" in cases involving the intersection between state public accommodations\nlaws and First Amendment rights); Roberts v. US. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 627, 104 S. Ct.\n3244, 82 L.

Stutzman's conduct-\n\nwhether it is characterized as creating floral arrangements, providing floral\n\narrangement services for opposite-sex weddings, or denying those services for same-\n\n\n\n\n                                          31\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nsex weddings-.is not like the inherently expressive activities at issue in these cases.\n\nInstead, it is like the unprotected conduct in FAIR, 54 7 U.S. at 66. 13\n\n      Finally, Stutzman asserts that even if her case doesn't fall neatly within the\n\ncontours of these prior holdings, we should nevertheless place her floral artistry\n\nwithin a new, narrow protection. The \"narrow\" exception she requests would apply\n\nto \"businesses, such as newspapers, publicists, speechwriters, photographers, and\n\nother artists, that create expression\" as opposed to gift items, raw products, or\n\nprearranged [items].\" Reply Br. of Appellants at 45. In her case, she proposes that\n\nshe would be willing to sell Mr. Ingersoll \"uncut flowers and premade\n\n\n\n\n       13 Stutzman and amici point to a handful of cases protecting various forms of art-\nand some of them do seem to provide surface support for their argument. See Br. of\nAppellants at 6-7; Mot. for Leave to File Br. & Br. for Cato lnst. as Amicus Curiae in Supp.\nof Appellants (Cato) at 7 (citing Wardv. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,790-91, 109\nS. Ct. 2746, 105 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1989) (music without words); Se. Promotions, Ltd. v.\nConrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557-58, 95 S. Ct. 1239, 43 L. Ed. 2d 448 (1975) (theater); Anderson\nv. City of Hermosa Beach, 621 F.3d 1051, 1060 (9th Cir. 2010) (tattooing); Piarowski v.\nIll. Cmty. Coil. Dist. 515, 759 F.2d 625, 627-28 (7th Cir. 1985) (stained glass windows on\ndisplay in an art gallery at a junior college)).\n        But, on closer examination, those cases do not expand the definition of \"expressive\nconduct.\" For example, Piarowski held that stained glass windows were protected in the\ncontext of a college's demands that the artist move some of his pieces from a gallery to an\nalternate location on campus because they were objected to as \"sexually explicit and\nracially offensive.\" 759 F.2d at 632. And the Anderson court reached its finding that\ntattoos receive First Amendment protections by pointing out that they \"are generally\ncomposed of words, realistic or abstract images, symbols, or a combination of these, all of\nwhich are forms of pure expression that are entitled to full First Amendment protection.\"\n621 F.3d at 1061. Stutzman's floral arrangements do not implicate any similar concerns.\n                                            32\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\narrangements.\" !d. at 46. But, as amicus Americans United for Separation of Church\n\nand State (Americans United) points out, Stutzman's rule would create a \"two-tiered\n\nsystem\" that carves out an enormous hole from public accommodations laws: under\n\nsuch a system, a \"dime-store lunch counter would be required to serve interracial\n\ncouples but an upscale bistro could turn them away.\" Br. of Amicus Curiae Ams.\n\nUnited in Supp. of Resp'ts at 13. Indeed, the New Mexico Supreme Court also\n\ngrappled with this question, ultimately finding that \"[ c]ourts cannot be in the\n\nbusiness of deciding which businesses are sufficiently artistic to warrant exemptions\n\nfrom antidiscrimination laws,\" and noting that this concern was hardly hypothetical\n\nin light of the proliferation of cases requesting exceptions for \"florists, bakeries, and\n\nother wedding vendors\" who refused to serve gay couples. Elane Photography, 309\n\nP.3d at 71.\n\n      Because Stutzman's sale of floral arrangements is not expressive conduct\n\nprotected by the First Amendment, we affirm the trial court and hold that the WLAD\n\ndoes not violate free speech protections as applied to Stutzman in this case.\n\n              B. Stutzman does not argue that article I, section 5 of the Washington\n                 Constitution provides any greater protection than the First\n                 Amendment in this context; we therefore affirm the trial court's\n                 ruling that no article I, section 5 violation occurred in this case\n\n       Stutzman asserts violations of both state and federal free speech constitutional\n\nprovisions, though she does not distinguish between them.\n\n                                           33\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      As the Superior Court correctly points out, we interpret article I, section 5\n\nindependently from the First Amendment. Bradburn v. N. Cent. Reg'l Library Dist.,\n\n168 Wn.2d 789, 800, 231 P.3d 166 (2010). In some cases, we have found article I,\n\nsection 5 to be more protective than its federal counterpart, and in some cases, we\n\nhave held the two to contain equivalent protections. ld. In this case, however,\n\nStutzman has not assigned error to the Superior Court's use of a First Amendment\n\nanalysis rather than a separate state constitutional analysis. We therefore decline to\n\nreach the issue of whether article I, section 5 rights in this context are coextensive\n\nwith First Amendment rights.\n\n      III.     As Applied in This Case, the WLAD Does Not Violate Stutzman's\n               Right to Religious Free Exercise under the First Amendment to the\n              ·united States Constitution\n\n      In her second constitutional claim, Stutzman argues that the WLAD, as\n\napplied to her in this case, violated her First Amendment right to religious free\n\nexercise. We disagree.\n\n      The free exercise clause of the First Amendment, which applies to the States\n\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303, 60\n\nS. Ct. 900, 84 L. Ed. 1213 (1940), provides that \"Congress shall make no law\n\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nLaws that burden religion are subject to two different levels of scrutiny under the\n\n\n                                          34\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nfree exercise clause. U.S. CaNST. amend I.              Neutral, generally applicable laws\n\nburdening religion are subject to rational basis review, 14 while laws that discriminate\n\nagainst some or all religions (or regulate conduct because it is undertaken for\n\nreligious reasons) are subject to strict scrutiny .15\n\n       Stutzman argues that the WLAD is subject to strict scrutiny under a First\n\nAmendment free exercise analysis because it is neither neutral nor generally\n\napplicable. She is incorrect.\n\n       A law is not neutral, for purposes of a First Amendment free exercise\n\nchallenge if\"the object of [the] law is to infringe upon or restrict practices because\n\nof their religious motivation.\" Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of\n\nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 533, 113 S. Ct. 2217, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1993) (emphasis\n\nadded). Stutzman does not argue that our legislature passed the WLAD in order to\n\ntarget religious people or people whose religions dictate opposition to gay marriage.\n\nInstead, she argues that the WLAD is unfair because it grants exemptions for\n\n\"religious organizations\" 16-permitting these organizations to refuse marriage\n\n\n       14   Emp 't Div., Dep 't of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595,\n108 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1990).\n       15\n         Church of the Lukumi BabaluAye, Inc. v. City ofHialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 532, 113\nS. Ct. 2217, 124 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1993).\n\n       16\n         See RCW 26.04.010(6) (\"A religious organization shall be immune from any civil\nclaim or cause of action, including a claim pursuant to chapter 49.60 RCW, based on its\n                                              35\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nservices-but does not extend those same exemptions to her. Br. of Appellants at\n\n37.\n\n      We disagree. The cases on which Stutzman relies all address laws that single\n\nout for onerous regulation either religious conduct in general or conduct linked to a\n\nparticular religion, while exempting secular conduct or conduct associated with\n\nother, nontargeted religions. E.g., Lukumi Babalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 532-42 (law was\n\nnot neutral where legislative history, including enactment of numerous exemptions\n\nfor members of other religions, evidenced a clear intent to target practitioners of\n\nSanteria faith). They recognize that the \"[t]he Free Exercise Clause forbids any\n\nregulation of beliefs as such,\" and that this unconstitutional regulation may\n\nsometimes be accomplished through a law that appears facially neutral. Blackhawk\n\nv. Pennsylvania, 381 F.3d 202, 208-09 (3d Cir. 2004). But blanket exemptions for\n\nreligious organizations do not evidence an intent to target religion. Instead, they\n\nindicate the opposite. Corp. ofPresiding Bishop of Church ofJesus Christ ofLatter-\n\nDay Saints v. Amos, 483 U.S. 327, 335-38, 107 S. Ct. 2862, 97 L.

That authority stands for\n\ntwo principles, neither of which is implicated here.\n\n      First, a law may fail the \"general applicability\" test, and thus trigger strict\n\nscrutiny, if it adopts a patchwork of specific exemptions that conspicuously omits\n\ncertain religiously motivated conduct. As with nonneutrallaws, such an omission is\n\nevidence that the government has deliberately targeted religious conduct for onerous\n\nregulation, or at the very least devalued religion as a ground for exemption. Lukumi\n\nBabalu Aye, 508 U.S. at 544-46 (holding that ordinance was not generally applicable\n\nbecause it \"pursues the city's governmental interests only against conduct motivated\n\n\n                                          37\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nby religious belief' (emphasis added)); Fraternal Order of Police Newark Lodge\n\nNo. 12 v.

Lighthouse\n\nInst.for Evangelism, Inc. v. City of Long Branch, 510 F.3d 253,276 (3d.

Under a First Amendment free exercise analysis, the WLAD would trigger\n\nstrict scrutiny if it permitted that sort of discrimination only for nonreligious reasons,\n\nand thus indicated the government's preference for secular discrimination. But the\n\nWLAD does not do this.\n\n      Three of the alleged \"exemptions\" Stutzman cites have nothing at all to do\n\nwith the exemption she seeks (an exemption permitting discrimination in public\n\naccommodations). The exemption for \"[people] renting [out] certain multifamily\n\ndwellings,\" Br. of Appellants at 38 (citing RCW 49.60.040(5))-is not really an\n\nexemption from the WLAD at all.            RCW 49.60.040(5) defines a \"'[c]overed\n\nmultifamily dwelling'\" to exclude all buildings with fewer than four units and certain\n\nbuildings with no elevators.       In conjunction with RCW 49.60.222(2)(c), this\n\nprovision requires that \"covered multifamily dwellings\" be designed and constructed\n\nin compliance with state and federal disability access laws. This is not a license for\n\ncertain landlords to discriminate. With respect to public accommodations, the same\n\nis true of the WLAD' s \"exemptions\" for individuals employed in domestic service\n\nor by family members and for \"employers\" with fewer than eight employees. See\n\nBr. of Appellants at 38 (citing RCW 49.60.040(10), (11)). These exemptions protect\n\n\n                                            39\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nemployers from WLAD liability as employers-that is, liability to their\n\nemployees-in the context of family relationships, domestic service, and very small\n\nbusinesses; they have nothing to do with Stutzman's liability as the proprietor of a\n\npublic accommodation.      Compare RCW 49.60.180 (listing prohibited \"[u]nfair\n\npractices of employers,\" all of which discriminate against employees or potential\n\nemployees-not customers), with RCW 49.60.215 (listing prohibited \"[u]nfair\n\npractices of places of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, amusement\";\n\ncompletely omitting any reference to \"employers\"). Thus, these exemptions are\n\ndistinguishable from the exemptions at issue in Lukumi Babalu Aye, Blackhawk, or\n\nFraternal Order of Police because none is an exemption that Stutzman would\n\nactually like to invoke.\n\n      And the other \"exemption\" Stutzman identifies-for distinctly private\n\norganizations, Br. of Appellants at 38 (citing RCW 49.60.040(2))-does not\n\nundermine the purposes of the WLAD' s public accommodations provision: to\n\nprevent discrimination in public accommodations. Thus, it does not trigger strict\n\nscrutiny under a First Amendment free exercise analysis, either. Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice, 170 F.3d at 366 (contrasting exemptions that undermine a law's purpose-\n\nand thus trigger strict scrutiny-with exemptions for \"activities that [the\n\ngovernment] does not have an interest in preventing\"; holding that police\n\n\n                                         40\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\ndepartment's exemption permitting undercover officers to wear beards did not\n\ntrigger strict scrutiny because the governmental interest served by the shaving\n\nrequirement-making officers readily recognizable as officers-did not apply to\n\nundercover officers).\n\n      For these reasons, we reject Stutzman's claim that the WLAD, as applied to\n\nher, triggers strict scrutiny under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe WLAD is a neutral, generally applicable law subject to rational basis review.\n\nEmp 't Div., Dep 't ofHuman Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S. Ct. 1595, 108\n\nL. Ed. 2d 876 (1990). And the WLAD clearly meets that standard: it is rationally\n\nrelated to the government's legitimate interest in ensuring equal access to public\n\naccommodations. See Lighthouse, 510 F.3d at 277 (to withstand free exercise\n\nchallenge, neutral, generally applicable law \"must be reasonable and not arbitrary\n\nand it must bear' a rational relationship to a [permissible] state objective\"' (alteration\n\nin original) (quoting Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1, 8, 94 S. Ct. 1536, 39 L. Ed.\n\n2d 797 (1974))).\n\n\n\n\n                                           41\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      IV.     As Applied in This Case, the WLAD Did Not Violate Stutzman's Right\n              to Religious Free Exercise under Article I, Section 11 of the\n              Washington Constitution\n\n              A. This court has applied strict judicial scrutiny to certain article I,\n                 section 11 claims\n\n      Stutzman also raises a state constitutional challenge to the WLAD as applied\n\nto her religiously motivated conduct in this case.      Article I, section 11 of the\n\nWashington Constitution provides, in relevant part:\n\n      Absolute freedom of conscience in all matters of religious sentiment,\n      belief and worship, shall be guaranteed to every individual, and no one\n      shall be molested or disturbed in person or property on account of\n      religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby secured shall not be so\n      construed as to excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices\n      inconsistent with the peace and safety of the state.\n\nObviously, this language differs from the language of the First Amendment's free\n\nexercise clause.\n\n      In the past, however, we interpreted article I, section 11 to provide the same\n\nprotection as the First Amendment's free exercise clause.        See First Covenant\n\nChurch ofSeattle v. City ofSeattle, 114 Wn.2d 392,402,787 P.2d 1352 (1990) (First\n\nCovenant I), vacated and remanded, 499 U.S. 901, 111 S. Ct. 1097, 113 L. Ed. 2d\n\n208 ( 1991 ). Thus, for many years this court relied on First Amendment free exercise\n\ncase law in article I, section 11 challenges and applied strict scrutiny to laws\n\nburdening religion. Id. (citing Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S. Ct. 1790, 10\n\n                                          42\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nL. Ed. 2d 965 (1963); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S. Ct. 1526, 32 L. Ed.\n\n2d 15 (1972); Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm 'n, 480 U.S. 136, 107 S. Ct.\n\n1046, 94 L. Ed. 2d 190 (1987) (law burdening religion must serve \"compelling state\n\ninterest\" and \"constitute[] the least restrictive means to achieve the government's\n\nobjective\")). 17\n\n       In 1990, however, things changed. That was the year that the United States\n\nSupreme Court adopted rational basis review for claims that neutral, generally\n\napplicable laws (like the WLAD) incidentally burden religion, in Smith, 494 U.S. at\n\n878-90. Smith definitively repudiated strict scrutiny for neutral, generally applicable\n\nlaws prohibiting \"socially harmful conduct.\" I d. at 884-85. It reasoned that applying\n\nheightened scrutiny-which requires a balancing of governmental against personal\n\ninterests-would pose two problems. Id. First, it would vitiate the state's ability to\n\nregulate, allowing every individual \"'to become a law unto himself.\"' Id. at 885\n\n\n\n       17 Some scholarship distinguishes between the ''compelling interest\" test and \"strict\nscrutiny.\" E.g., Stephen A. Siegel, The Origin of the Compelling State Interest Test and\nStrict Scrutiny, 48 AM. J. LEGAL HIST. 355, 359-60 (2008) (describing the \"compelling\ninterest\" standard as one of three barriers that legislation must overcome under strict\nscrutiny). But this court has always treated them as synonymous in religious free exercise\ncases. E.g., Backlund, 106 Wn.2d at 641 (\"Since [the plaintiffs] beliefs are protected by\nthe free exercise clause of the First Amendment, the burden of proof shifts to the Board to\nprove that (1) a compelling governmental interest justifies the regulation in question and\n(2) the regulation is the least restrictive imposition on the practice of his belief to satisfy\nthat interest.\" (citing United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 257, 102 S. Ct. 1051, 71 L. Ed.\n2d 127 (1982); State v. Meacham, 93 Wn.2d 735,740,612 P.2d 795 (1980))).\n                                              43\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n(quoting Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 145, 167, 25 L. Ed. 2d 244\n\n(1878) ). Second, it would entangle civil courts in religion by requiring them to\n\nevaluate the significance of a particular practice to a faith. Smith, 494 U.S. at 887\n\n(\"[r]epeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not\n\npresume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility\n\nof a religious claim\"). The Smith Court reasoned that such a balancing test would\n\nbe incompatible with the religious pluralism that is fundamental to our national\n\nidentity. 494 U.S. at 888.\n\n      Smith's holding is limited in two ways. First, it left in place prior First\n\nAmendment case law applying the \"compelling interest\" balancing test where the\n\nstatute in question \"lent itself to individualized . . . assessment\"-e.g., an\n\nunemployment benefits statute under which an administrative court determines, on\n\na case-by-case basis, whether a person was fired for good cause. Id. at 884. In such\n\ncases, the Court explained that \"the State [already] has in place a system of\n\nindividual exemptions\"-thus, the challenged law is not \"generally applicable\" for\n\npurposes of First Amendment free exercise analysis. Id. Where an individual\n\nrequests a religious exemption from such a law, the government must have a\n\ncompelling reason for denying it. Id. Second, the Smith Court distinguished cases\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\ninvolving \"hybrid\" claims-e.g., challenges to laws that burdened both religious\n\nfreedom and another right such as free speech. !d. at 881 (collecting cases).\n\n      We revisited our article I, section 11 test following Smith in First Covenant\n\nChurch of Seattle v. City of Seattle, 120 Wn.2d 203, 840 P.2d 174 (1992) (First\n\nCovenant II). In that case, the plaintiff church argued that its designation as a\n\nhistorical landmark (subject to \"controls\" limiting alterations to its building) violated\n\nboth First Amendment and article I, section 11 protections. !d. at 208-09. In First\n\nCovenant I, we applied strict scrutiny to both constitutional challenges and held that\n\nthe zoning law was unconstitutional. 114 Wn.2d at 401-02, 410. On remand from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court following Smith, we addressed the state and federal\n\nfree exercise claims again.      Regarding the First Amendment claim, the First\n\nCovenant II court held that the challenged statute fell within both of the exceptions\n\nto rational basis review recognized in Smith: it created a system of \"individualized\n\nassessments\" and it raised \"hybrid\" constitutional concerns (by restricting speech as\n\nwell as religious free exercise). 120 Wn.2d at 214-17. The court therefore held that\n\nthe historical landmark statute was subject to strict scrutiny under the First\n\nAmendment. !d. at 217-18.\n\n      But after determining that the statute failed strict scrutiny as applied to the\n\nplaintiff church-because a city's purely aesthetic or cultural interest in preserving\n\n\n                                           45\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nhistorical landmarks is not compelling-the First Covenant II court went on to\n\nseparately analyze the church's article I, section 11 claim. Id. at 223 (\"The possible\n\nloss of significant architectural elements is a price we must accept to guarantee the\n\nparamount right of religious freedom ... [and] [a]lthough we might ... base our\n\ndecision solely on federal grounds, we decline to do so.\"). It performed a Gunwall 18\n\nanalysis and concluded that article I, section 11 \"extends broader protection than the\n\n[F]irst [A]mendment ... and precludes the City from imposing [the disputed]\n\nLandmarks Preservation Ordinance on First Covenant's church.\" Id. at 229-30.\n\n       Since that time, our court has addressed four article I, section 11 claims-all\n\nby churches challenging land use regulations 19-and has subjected the challenged\n\nlaw to strict scrutiny in each case. Thus, both before and after Smith and First\n\nCovenant II, we have applied the same four-prong analysis in an article I, section 11\n\n\n\n\n       18 State v. Gunwall, 106 Wn.2d 54, 720 P.2d 808 (1986). A Gunwall analysis\ndetermines whether a state constitutional provision is more protective than its federal\ncounterpart by considering six nonexclusive factors: ( 1) the text of the state constitutional\nprovision at issue, (2) significant differences between the text of parallel state and federal\nconstitutional provisions, (3) state constitutional and common law history, (4) state law\npredating the state constitution, (5) structural differences between the state and federal\nconstitutions, and (6) matters of particular state or local concern. !d. at 61-62.\n\n       19\n         City of Woodinville v. Northshore United Church ofChrist, 166 Wn.2d 633, 644-\n45, 211 P.3d 406 (2009); Open Door Baptist Church v. Clark County, 140 Wn.2d 143,\n156-60,995 P.2d 33 (2000); Munns v. Martin, 131 Wn.2d 192, 195,930 P.2d 318 (1997);\nFirst United Methodist Church of Seattle v. Hr 'g Exam 'r for Seattle Landmarks Pres. Bd.,\n129 Wn.2d 238, 249-50, 252-53, 916 P.2d 374 (1996).\n                                             46\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nchallenge: where a party has (1) a sincere religious belief and (2) the exercise of that\n\nbelief is substantially burdened by the challenged law, the law is enforceable against\n\nthat party only if it (3) serves a compelling government interest and (4) is the least\n\nrestrictive means of achieving that interest.        City of Woodinville v. Northshore\n\nUnited Church of Christ, 166 Wn.2d 633, 642, 211 P.3d 406 (2009); Backlund, 106\n\nWn.2d at 641. And we have specifically held--in the context of a church's challenge\n\nto a zoning law-that article I, section 11 is more protective of religious free exercise\n\nthan the First Amendment is. E.g., First Covenant II, 120 Wn.2d at 224 (applying\n\nstrict scrutiny to zoning ordinance as a matter of state constitutional law because\n\n\"[ o ]ur state constitutional and common law history support a broader reading of\n\narticle [I], section 11, than of the First Amendment\"). 20\n\n\n\n\n       20\n          The attorney general correctly notes that this court has never held that a corporate\ndefendant such as Arlene's Flowers has a \"conscience\" or \"sentiment\" subject to article I,\nsection 11 protections. See Att'y Gen. Resp. Br. at 31 (\"Indeed the plain language of article\nI, section 11 guarantees its protections to 'every individual,' maldng no mention of\nprotection for businesses.\"); Att'y Gen.'s Ans. to Brs. of Amici Curiae at 19 (\"Neither\nDefendants nor their amici point to any Washington authority to support the notion that\nfor-profit corporations are protected by article I, section 11.\"). But Stutzman argues only\nthat she may assert her own free exercise rights on behalf of her corporation. Br. of\nAppellants at 32 n.24 ('protecting the free-exercise rights of [closely held] corporations .\n. . protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control those companies\"'\n(emphasis added) (quoting Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.,_ U.S. _, 134 S. Ct.\n2751, 2768, 189 L. Ed. 2d 675 (2014))). Thus, we address only Stutzman's individual\nclaim that her article I, section 11 rights have been violated. We do not address whether\nArlene's Flowers (the corporation) has any such rights.\n                                             47\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      The parties dispute the significance of these post-Smith holdings to this case.\n\nIngersoll and the attorney general argue that they are limited to zoning laws, as\n\napplied to churches, and thus make no difference to the outcome under our long-\n\nstanding four-prong test. They maintain that a neutral health and safety regulation\n\nlike the WLAD creates no substantial burden on free exercise-and thus does not\n\ntrigger strict scrutiny-when it operates in the commercial marketplace. Stutzman\n\ncontends that under First Covenant II and its progeny, \"strict scrutiny applies even\n\nif the regulation 'indirectly burdens the exercise of religion.'\" Br. of Appellants at\n\n33 (quoting First Covenant II, 120 Wn.2d at 226).\n\n       We decline to resolve that dispute here because we conclude that Stutzman's\n\nfree exercise claim fails even under the test she advances. Even if article I, section\n\n11 provides Stutzman with the strongest possible protections, subjecting the WLAD\n\nto strict scrutiny in this case, her state constitutional challenge must still fail.\n\n              B. The WLAD survives strict scrutiny\n\n       In the decades before First Covenant II, this court upheld numerous health\n\nand safety regulations under strict scrutiny-the test that we then assumed was\n\nrequired under the First Amendment.              E.g., Backlund, 106 Wn.2d at 641\n\n(requirement that physician purchase professional liability insurance did not violate\n\nFirst Amendment; State had a compelling interest in licensure requirement and the\n\n\n                                            48\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nrequirement was \"the least restrictive imposition on the practice of [the plaintiff's]\n\nbelief to satisfy that interest\"); State v. Meacham, 93 Wn.2d 735, 740-41, 612 P.2d\n\n795 ( 1980) (court-ordered blood test for putative fathers did not violate First\n\nAmendment; State had a compelling interest in securing child support and that\n\ninterest could not \"be achieved by measures less drastic\"); State ex rel. Holcomb v.\n\nArmstrong, 39 Wn.2d 860, 861, 863-64, 239 P.2d 545 (1952) (neither First\n\nAmendment nor prior version of article I, section 11 barred mandatory tuberculosis\n\ntesting as condition of admission to University of Washington; \"the public interest\n\n[served] is the health of all of the students and employees of the university[;] .. .\n\n[t]he danger to this interest is clear and present, grave and immediate [and] .. .\n\n[i]nfringement of appellant's rights is a necessary consequence of a practical attempt\n\nto avoid the danger\"); see also State v. Clifford, 57 Wn. App. 127, 132-34, 787 P.2d\n\n571 (1990) (law mandating that drivers be licensed does not violate First\n\nAmendment; \"[t]here is no less restrictive means available to satisfy the State's\n\ncompelling interest in regulating the driving of motor vehicles\"). Like all of the laws\n\nat issue in those cases, the WLAD's public accommodations provision is a neutral\n\nhealth and safety regulation. Under our long-standing precedent, such laws satisfy\n\nstrict scrutiny in an article I, section 11 challenge.\n\n\n\n\n                                            49\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      To be sure, none of our previous article I, section 11 cases addressed an\n\nantidiscrimination law. But numerous other courts have heard religious free exercise\n\nchallenges to such laws and upheld them under strict scrutiny. E.g., Swanner v.\n\nAnchorage Equal Rights Comm 'n, 874 P.2d 274, 281-83 (Alaska 1994) (in rental\n\nhousing context, state antidiscrimination law passed strict scrutiny-meaning that\n\ndefendants were not entitled to a religious exemption-because \"[t]he government\n\nviews acts of discrimination as independent social evils even if the prospective\n\ntenants ultimately find housing\"; moreover, \"[ v]oluntary commercial activity does\n\nnot receive the same status accorded to directly religious activity\"); State v. Sports\n\n& Health Club, Inc., 370 N.W.2d 844, 852-54 (Minn. 1985) (in employment context,\n\nstate antidiscrimination law passed strict scrutiny in religious free exercise challenge\n\nbecause \"[t]he state's overriding compelling interest of eliminating discrimination\n\nbased upon sex, race, marital status, or religion could be substantially frustrated if\n\nemployers, professing as deep and sincere religious beliefs as those held by\n\nappellants, could discriminate against the protected classes\"); N. Coast Women's\n\nCare Med. Grp., Inc. v. Superior Court, 44 Cal. 4th 1145, 1158-59, 81 Cal.

Indeed, we are not aware of any\n\n\n                                           51\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\ncase invalidating an antidiscrimination law under a free exercise strict scrutiny\n\nanalysis.\n\n      Nevertheless, Stutzman argues that strict scrutiny is not satisfied in this case.\n\nShe reasons that since other florists were willing to serve Ingersoll, no real harm will\n\ncome from her refusal. And she maintains that the government therefore can't have\n\nany compelling interest in applying the WLAD to her shop.              In other words,\n\nStutzman contends that there is no reason to enforce the WLAD when, as she puts\n\nit, \"[N]o access problem exists.\" Br. of Appellants at 46.\n\n      We emphatically reject this argument. We agree with Ingersoll and Freed that\n\n\"[t]his case is no more about access to flowers than civil rights cases in the 1960s\n\nwere about access to sandwiches.\" Br. of Resp'ts Ingersoll and Freed at 32. As\n\nevery other court to address the question has concluded, public accommodations\n\nlaws do not simply guarantee access to goods or services. Instead, they serve a\n\nbroader societal purpose: eradicating barriers to the equal treatment of all citizens in\n\nthe commercial marketplace. Were we to carve out a patchwork of exceptions for\n\nostensibly justified discrimination,2 1 that purpose would be fatally undermined.\n\n\n       21\n         Stutzman argues that discrimination cannot be \"invidious\"-and thus subject to\ngovernmental prohibition-if it is based on religious beliefs. Br. of Appellants at 40-43.\nBut she cites no relevant legal authority for this novel theory. She also argues that the\ngovernment has no compelling interest in forcing her to speak or associate with Ingersoll\nor any other customer. But, as explained elsewhere in this opinion, the WLAD does not\nimplicate Stutzman's rights of speech or association.\n                                           52\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      In conclusion, we assume without deciding that strict scrutiny applies to the\n\nWLAD in this article I, section 11 challenge, and we hold that the law satisfies that\n\nstandard.\n\n      V.       As Applied in This Case, the WLAD Does Not Violate Stutzman's\n               Right to Free Association under the First Amendment to the United\n               States Constitution\n\n      Stutzman argues that the WLAD, as applied by the trial court in her case,\n\nviolates her First Amendment right to freedom of association. But to support that\n\nargument, she relies exclusively on cases addressing membership in private clubs:\n\nBoy Scouts of America v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 653, 120 S. Ct. 2446, 147 L. Ed. 2d\n\n554 (2000); Hurley, 515 U.S. at 574; and Roberts, 468 U.S. at 618. 22 These cases\n\nexpressly distinguish a business' customer service (subject to generally applicable\n\nantidiscrimination laws) from expressive conduct (protected from such laws by the\n\nFirst Amendment). Dale, 530 U.S. at 648, 656-57 (\"To determine whether a group\n\nis protected by the First Amendment's expressive associational right, we must\n\ndetermine      whether    the   group    engages    m     'expressive    association'\"·\n                                                                                      '\nantidiscrimination law violated the Boy Scouts' First Amendment freedom of\n\nassociation in part because the Boy Scouts was a membership organization instead\n\n\n      22\n            Stutzman also cites one case addressing speech: United States v. Playboy\nEntertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 818, 120 S. Ct. 1878, 146 L. Ed. 2d 865 (2000).\nReply Br. of Appellants at 28. This opinion addresses Stutzman's free expression claim\nelsewhere.\n                                          53\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nof a \"clearly commercial entit[y].\"); Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572, 571 (state\n\nantidiscrimination law at issue traditionally applied to \"the provision of publicly\n\navailable goods, privileges, and services\" by, \"[a]t common law, innkeepers, smiths,\n\nand others who 'made profession of a public employment\"'; but it would be\n\n\"peculiar\" to extend that law beyond the customer service context so that it applied\n\nto the inherently expressive conduct of marching in a parade).\n\n         In fact, the United States Supreme Court has even held that states may enforce\n\nantidiscrimination laws against certain private organizations, defined by particular\n\ngoals and ideologies, if the enforcement will not impair the group's ability to pursue\n\nthose goals and espouse those ideologies. Roberts, 468 U.S. at 628 (even though\n\nFirst Amendment protects private groups, those groups are subject to\n\nantidiscrimination laws to the extent that enforcement \"will [not] change the content\n\nor impact of the organization's speech\").\n\n         But the Supreme Court has never held that a commercial enterprise, open to\n\nthe general public, is an '\"expressive association'\" for purposes ofFirst Amendment\n\nprotections, Dale, 530 U.S. at 648. We therefore reject Stutzman's free association\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      VI.     As Applied in This Case, the WLAD Does Not Violate Stutzman's\n              Constitutional Protections under the \"Hybrid Rights\" Doctrine\n\n      Stutzman also argues that the WLAD, as applied to her in this case, triggers\n\nstrict scrutiny because it implicates \"hybrid rights.\" Br. of Appellants at 40. As\n\nnoted above, a law triggers strict scrutiny if it burdens both religious free exercise\n\nand another fundamental right such as speech or association. First Covenant II, 120\n\nWn.2d at 217-18 (\"[t]he less protective free exercise standard set forth in Smith ...\n\ndoes not apply because the case presents a 'hybrid situation': First Covenant's claim\n\ninvolves the free exercise clause in conjunction with free speech\" (citing Smith, 494\n\nU.S. at 904 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment))). But Stutzman's claim fails\n\nfor two reasons. First, the only fundamental right implicated in this case is the right\n\nto religious free exercise. Stutzman's rights to speech and association are not\n\nburdened. See supra Parts II, V. Second, even if the WLAD does trigger strict\n\nscrutiny in this case, it satisfies that standard. See supra Section IV.B.\n\n      VII.    The Trial Court Did Not Err by Imposing Personal Liability on\n              Stutzman Instead of Solely on Her Corporation, Arlene's Flowers Inc.\n\n      In addition to finding that Stutzman violated the WLAD, the trial court also\n\nfound that Stutzman violated the CPA. This is because the WLAD provides that an\n\nact of public accommodation discrimination is an \"unfair practice\" and a per se\n\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nviolation ofthe CPA. RCW 49.60.030(3). 23 Stutzman concedes that if she violated\n\nthe WLAD, then Arlene's Flowers is liable for a CPA violation.\n\n      But Stutzman argues that she cannot be personally liable for violating the CPA\n\nbecause (1) she kept her affairs separate from Arlene's Flowers' and (2) no\n\nWashington court has ever applied the \"responsible-corporate-officer doctrine\"\n\noutside the fraud context. Br. of Appellants at 49 (citing Grayson v. Nordic Constr.\n\nCo., 92 Wn.2d 548, 552-53, 599 P.2d 1271 (1979); One Pac. Towers Homeowners'\n\nAss 'n v. HAL Real Estate Invs., Inc., 108 Wn. App. 330, 347-48, 30 P.3d 504 (2001),\n\naff'd in part and rev 'din part, 148 Wn.2d 319, 61 PJd 1094 (2002)).\n\n      The authority Stutzman cites does not support this argument. In Grayson, this\n\ncourt held that the defendant could be personally liable for his company's CPA\n\nviolation even though there were no grounds for piercing the corporate veil. 92\n\nWn.2d at 553-54. This directly contradicts Stutzman's theory that she cannot be\n\npersonally liable under the CPA unless she commingled her finances with Arlene's\n\n\n\n\n      23\n         The trial court also found that Stutzman's actions violated the CPA-because they\nwere an \"'unfair or deceptive act or practice . . . occurring in trade or commerce, and\n[impacting the] public interest'\"-even if she did not also violate the WLAD. CP at 2634-\n37 (quoting State v. Kaiser, 161 Wn. App. 705, 719, 254 P.3d 850 (2011)). This ruling is\nquestionable, but because we conclude that Stutzman did violate the WLAD, and because\nStutzman did not assign error to this ruling in her opening brief, we do not address it.\n\n                                           56\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nFlowers'. And the other case, One Pac. Towers, 108 Wn. App. 330, does not address\n\na CPA claim.\n\n      On the other hand, there is long-standing precedent in Washington holding\n\nthat individuals may be personally liable for a CPA violation if they \"participate[]\n\nin the wrongful conduct, or with knowledge approve[] of the conduct.\" State v.\n\nRalph Williams' N. W. Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 87 Wn.2d 298, 322, 553 P.2d 423\n\n( 197 6). Liability for such participation or approval does not depend on piercing the\n\ncorporate veil.   ld.   This is consistent with the CPA's plain language, which\n\nauthorizes the attorney general to bring an action against \"against any person to\n\nrestrain and prevent the doing of any act herein prohibited or declared to be\n\nunlawful,\" RCW 19.86.080(1) (emphasis added), and which defines \"person\" to\n\ninclude \"where applicable, natural persons,\" as well as corporate entities, RCW\n\n19.86.010(1).\n\n      Such individual liability does not constitute an application of, or expansion\n\nof, the responsible corporate officer doctrine. That doctrine expands liability from\n\na corporation to an individual officer who would not otherwise be liable \"where the\n\nofficer stands 'in responsible relation to a public danger.'\" Dep't of Ecology v.\n\nLundgren, 94 Wn. App. 236, 243, 971 P.2d 948 (1999) (quoting United States v.\n\nDotterweich, 320 U.S. 277,281, 64 S. Ct. 134, 88 L. Ed. 48 (1943)). Here, the trial\n\n\n                                          57\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\ncourt did not find Stutzman (the individual) vicariously or secondarily liable based\n\non conduct of Arlene's Flowers (the corporation). It found her liable because of acts\n\nthat she herself committed.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n      The State of Washington bars discrimination in public accommodations on\n\nthe basis of sexual orientation.     Discrimination based on same-sex marriage\n\nconstitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We therefore hold that\n\nthe conduct for which Stutzman was cited and fined in this case-refusing her\n\ncommercially marketed wedding floral services to Ingersoll and Freed because theirs\n\nwould be a same-sex wedding-constitutes sexual orientation discrimination under\n\nthe WLAD. We also hold that the WLAD may be enforced against Stutzman\n\nbecause it does not infringe any constitutional protection. As applied in this case,\n\nthe WLAD does not compel speech or association.              And assuming that it\n\nsubstantially burdens Stutzman's religious free exercise, the WLAD does not violate\n\nher right to religious free exercise under either the First Amendment or article I,\n\nsection 11 because it is a neutral, generally applicable law that serves our state\n\ngovernment's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination in public\n\naccommodations. We affirm the trial court's rulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n\n WE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n                        0~9\n\n                        V~-·\n              '7\n\n\n\n\n                   59\n\f",

Barronelle Stutzman owns\n\nand operates a place of public accommodation in our state: Arlene's Flowers Inc.\n\nStutzman and her public business, Arlene's Flowers and Gifts, refused to sell\n\nwedding flowers to Robert Ingersoll because his betrothed, Curt Freed, is a man.\n\nThe State and the couple sued, each alleging violations of the WLAD and the\n\nConsumer Protection Act (CPA), ch. 19.86 RCW.             Stutzman defended on the\n\ngrounds that the WLAD and CPA do not apply to her conduct and that, if they do,\n\nthose statutes violate her state and federal constitutional rights to free speech, free\n\nexercise, and free association.\n\n      The Benton County Superior Court granted summary judgment to the State\n\nand the couple, rejecting all of Stutzman's claims. We granted review and now\n\naffirm.\n\n                                       FACTS\n\n      In 2004, Ingersoll and Freed began a committed, romantic relationship. In\n\n2012, our state legislature passed Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill 6239, which\n\nrecognized equal civil marriage rights for same-sex couples. LAWS OF 2012, ch. 3,\n\n§ 1. Freed proposed marriage to Ingersoll that same year. The two intended to marry\n\non their ninth anniversary, in September 2013, and were \"excited about organizing\n\n[their] wedding.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 350. Their plans included inviting \"[a]\n\n\n                                           2\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nhundred plus\" guests to celebrate with them at Bella Fiori Gardens, complete with a\n\ndinner or reception, a photographer, a caterer, a wedding cake, and flowers. Id. at\n\n1775-77.\n\n      By the time he and Freed became engaged, Ingersoll had been a customer at\n\nArlene's Flowers for at least nine years, purchasing numerous floral arrangements\n\nfrom Stutzman and spending an estimated several thousand dollars at her shop.\n\nStutzman is the owner and president of Arlene's Flowers.             She employs\n\napproximately 10 people, depending on the season, including three floral designers,\n\none of whom is herself. Stutzman knew that Ingersoll is gay and that he had been in\n\na relationship with Freed for several years. The two men considered Arlene's\n\nFlowers to be \"[their] florist.\" Id. at 350.\n\n      Stutzman is an active member of the Southern Baptist church.             It is\n\nuncontested that her sincerely held religious beliefs include a belief that marriage\n\ncan exist only between one man and one woman.\n\n      On February 28, 2013, Ingersoll went to Arlene's Flowers on his way home\n\nfrom work, hoping to talk to Stutzman about purchasing flowers for his upcoming\n\nwedding. Ingersoll told an Arlene's Flowers employee that he was engaged to marry\n\nFreed and that they wanted Arlene's Flowers to provide the flowers for their\n\nwedding. The employee informed Ingersoll that Stutzman was not at the shop and\n\n\n                                               3\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nthat he would need to speak directly with her. The next day, Ingersoll returned to\n\nspeak with Ms. Stutzman. At that time, Stutzman told Ingersoll that she would be\n\nunable to do the flowers for his wedding because of her religious beliefs, specifically,\n\nbecause of\"her relationship with Jesus Christ.\" Id. at 155, 351, 1741-42, 1744-45,\n\n1763. Ingersoll did not have a chance to specify what kind of flowers or floral\n\narrangements he was seeking before Stutzman told him that she would not serve\n\nhim. They also did not discuss whether Stutzman would be asked to bring the\n\narrangements to the wedding location or whether the flowers would be picked up\n\nfrom her shop.\n\n       Stutzman asserts that she gave Ingersoll the name of other florists who might\n\nbe willing to serve him, and that the two hugged before Ingersoll left her store.\n\nIngersoll maintains that he walked away from that conversation \"feeling very hurt\n\nand upset emotionally.\" Id. at 1743.\n\n       Early the next morning, after a sleepless night, Freed posted a status update\n\non his personal Facebook feed regarding Stutzman's refusal to sell him wedding\n\nflowers. The update observed, without specifically naming Arlene's Flowers, that\n\nthe couple's \"favorite Richland Lee Boulevard flower shop\" had declined to provide\n\nflowers for their wedding on religious grounds, and noted that Freed felt \"so deeply\n\noffended that apparently our business is no longer good business,\" because \"[his]\n\n\n                                           4\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nloved one [did not fit] within their personal beliefs.\" Id. at 1262. This message was\n\napparently widely circulated, though Ingersoll testified that their Facebook settings\n\nwere such that the message was \"only intended for our friends and family.\" Id. at\n\n1760, 1785. Eventually, the story drew the attention of numerous media outlets.\n\n      As a result of the \"emotional toll\" Stutzman's refusal took on Freed and\n\nIngersoll, they \"lost enthusiasm for a large ceremony\" as initially imagined. Id. at\n\n1490. In fact, the two \"stopped planning for a wedding in September 2013 because\n\n[they] feared being denied service by other wedding vendors.\" I d. at 351. The\n\ncouple also feared that in light of increasing public attention-some of which caused\n\nthem to be concerned for their own safety-as well as then-ongoing litigation, a\n\nlarger wedding might require a security presence or attract protesters, such as the\n\nWestboro Baptist group.     So they were married on July 21, 2013, in a modest\n\nceremony at their home. There were 11 people in attendance. For the occasion,\n\nFreed and Ingersoll purchased one bouquet of flowers from a different florist and\n\nboutonnieres from their friend. When word of this story got out in the media, a\n\nhandful of florists offered to provide their wedding flowers free of charge.\n\n      Stutzman also received a great deal of attention from the publicity surrounding\n\nthis case, including threats to her business and other unkind messages.\n\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      Prior to Ingersoll's request, Arlene's Flowers had never had a request to\n\nprovide flowers for a same-sex wedding, and the only time Stutzman has ever\n\nrefused to serve a customer is when Ingersoll and Freed asked her to provide flowers\n\nfor their wedding. The decision not to serve Ingersoll was made strictly by Stutzman\n\nand her husband. After Ingersoll's and Freed's request, Stutzman developed an\n\n\"unwritten policy\" for Arlene's Flowers that they \"don't take same sex marriages.\"\n\nId. at 120. Stutzman states that the only reason for this policy is her conviction that\n\n\"biblically marriage is between a man and a woman.\" Id. at 120-21. Aside from\n\nIngersoll and Freed, she has served gay and lesbian customers in the past for other,\n\nnon-wedding-related flower orders.\n\n      Stutzman maintains that she would not sell Ingersoll any arranged flowers for\n\nhis wedding, even if he were asking her only to replicate a prearranged bouquet from\n\na picture book of sample arrangements. She believes that participating, or allowing\n\nany employee of her store to participate, in a same-sex wedding by providing custom\n\nfloral arrangements and related customer service is tantamount to endorsing\n\nmarriage equality for same-sex couples. She draws a distinction between creating\n\nfloral arrangements--even those designed by someone else-and selling bulk\n\nflowers and \"raw materials,\" which she would be happy to do for Ingersoll and\n\nFreed. I d. at 546-4 7. Stutzman believes that to create floral arrangements is to use\n\n\n                                           6\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nher \"imagination and artistic skill to intimately participate in a same-sex wedding\n\nceremony.\" Id. at 547. However, Stutzman aclmowledged that selling flowers for\n\nan atheistic or Muslim wedding would not be tantamount to endorsing those systems\n\nof belief.\n\n       By Stutzman's best estimate, approximately three percent of her business\n\ncomes from weddings. Stutzman is not currently providing any wedding floral\n\nservices (other than for members of her immediate family) during the pendency of\n\nthis case.\n\n                             PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       After the State became aware of Stutzman's refusal to sell flowers to Ingersoll\n\nand Freed, the Attorney General's Office sent Stutzman a letter. It sought her\n\nagreement to stop discriminating against customers on the basis of their sexual\n\norientation and noted that doing so would prevent further formal action or costs\n\nagainst her. The letter asked her to sign an \"Assurance of Discontinuance,\" which\n\nstated that she would no longer discriminate in the provision of wedding floral\n\nservices. Stutzman refused to sign the letter.\n\n       As a result, the State filed a complaint for injunctive and other relief under the\n\nCPA and WLAD against both Stutzman and Arlene's Flowers, in Benton County\n\nSuperior Court on April 9, 2013. Stutzman filed an answer on May 16, 2013,\n\n\n                                            7\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nasserting, among other defenses, that her refusal to furnish Ingersoll with wedding\n\nservices was protected by the state and federal constitutions' free exercise, free\n\nspeech, and freedom of association guaranties. Ingersoll and Freed filed a private\n\nlawsuit against Arlene's Flowers and Stutzman on April 18, 2013, which the trial\n\ncourt consolidated with the State's case on July 24, 2013. The parties filed various\n\ncross motions for summary judgment. The trial court ultimately entered judgment\n\nfor the plaintiffs in both cases, awarding permanent injunctive relief, as well as\n\nmonetary damages for Ingersoll and Freed to cover actual damages, attorneys' fees,\n\nand costs, and finding Stutzman personally liable.\n\n      When it granted the plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment, the trial court\n\nmade seven rulings that are at issue in this appeal. First, it issued two purely\n\nstatutory rulings: ( 1) that Stutzman violated the WLAD' s public accommodations\n\nprovision (RCW 49.60.215(1)) and the CPA (see RCW 19.86.020 and RCW\n\n49.60.030) by refusing to sell floral services for same-sex weddings and (2) that both\n\nStutzman (personally) and Arlene's Flowers (the corporate defendant) were liable\n\nfor these violations. CP at 2566-600. Next, the court made five constitutional\n\nrulings. It concluded that the application of the WLAD's public accommodations\n\nprovision to Stutzman in this case ( 1) did not violate Stutzman's right to free speech\n\nunder the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 5\n\n\n                                           8\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nof the Washington Constitution, (2) did not violate Stutzman's right to religious free\n\nexercise under the First Amendment, (3) did not violate her right to free association\n\nunder the First Amendment, (4) did not violate First Amendment protections under\n\nthe hybrid rights doctrine, and (5) did not violate Stutzman's right to religious free\n\nexercise under article I, section 11 of the Washington Constitution. !d. at 2601-60.\n\n      Stutzman appealed directly to this court, assigning error to all seven of those\n\nrulings. We granted direct review. Order, Ingersoll v. Arlene Js Flowers, No. 91615-\n\n2 (Wash. Mar. 2, 2016). With respect to most of the claims, Stutzman and Arlene's\n\nFlowers make identical arguments-in other words, Stutzman asserts that both she\n\nand her corporation enjoy identical rights of free speech, free exercise, and free\n\nassociation.

Stutzman's Refusal To Provide Custom Floral Arrangements for a\n              Same-Sex Wedding Violated the WLAD's Prohibition on\n              Discrimination in Public Accommodations, RCW 49.60.215\n\n      Stutzman's first statutory argument implicates the WLAD, chapter 49.60\n\nRCW. The trial court ruled that Stutzman violated RCW 49.60.215, which prohibits\n\ndiscrimination in the realm of public accommodations. That statute provides:\n\n      (1)     It shall be an unfair practice for any person or the person's agent\n      or employee to commit an act which directly or indirectly results in any\n      distinction, restriction, or discrimination, or the requiring of any person\n      to pay a larger sum than the uniform rates charged other persons, or the\n      refusing or withholding from any person the admission, patronage,\n      custom, presence, frequenting, dwelling, staying, or lodging in any\n      place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement,\n      except for conditions and limitations established by law and applicable\n      to all persons, regardless of ... sexual orientation ....\n\nRCW 49.60.215. The protected class status of \"sexual orientation\" was added to\n\nthis provision in 2006. LAws OF 2006, ch. 4, § 13.\n\n      The WLAD defines places of public accommodation to include places\n\nmaintained \"for the sale of goods, merchandise, services, or personal property, or\n\nfor the rendering of personal services . . . . \"     RCW 49.60.040(2).        Protected\n\nindividuals are guaranteed \"[t]he right to the full enjoyment of any of the\n\naccommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges\" of such places.              RCW\n\n                                          10\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n49.60.030(1)(b). Additionally, the WLAD states that \"[t]he right to be free from\n\ndiscrimination because of . .. sexual orientation ... is recognized as and declared to\n\nbe a civil right,\" RCW 49.60.030(1) (emphasis added).          The WLAD prohibits\n\ndiscrimination on the different basis of \"marital status\" in the employment context,\n\nbut not in the context of public accommodations. Compare RCW 49.60.180 (listing\n\n\"marital status\" as a protected class in section governing unfair practices of\n\nemployers) with RCW 49.60.215 (omitting marital status from analogous public\n\naccommodations statute).\n\n      RCW 49.60.030(2) authorizes private plaintiffs to bring suit for violations of\n\nthe WLAD. To make out a prima facie case under the WLAD for discrimination in\n\nthe public accommodations context, the plaintiff must establish four elements: (1)\n\nthat the plaintiff is a member of a protected class, RCW 49.60.030(1); (2) that the\n\ndefendant is a place of public accommodation, RCW 49.60.215; (3) that the\n\ndefendant discriminated against the plaintiff, whether directly or indirectly, id.; and\n\n(4) that the discrimination occurred \"because of' the plaintiffs status or, in other\n\nwords, that the protected status was a substantial factor causing the discrimination,\n\nRCW 49.60.030.

See Br. of Appellants at 19-21. 1 She offers three arguments in support of\n\nthis interpretation of the statute.\n\n       First, Stutzman argues that if she discriminated against Ingersoll, it was on the\n\nbasis of his \"marital status,\" not his \"sexual orientation.\" Br. of Appellants at 19-\n\n21.   Second, she argues that the legislature could not have intended the 2006\n\namendments to protect people seeking same-sex wedding services since same-sex\n\nmarriages were \"illegal\" in Washington in 2006. Id. at 15-17. She points out that\n\nwhen the legislature amended the public accommodations provisions of the WLAD\n\nin 2006, it also added language stating that the chapter \"shall not be construed to\n\nendorse any specific belief, practice, behavior, or orientation,\" and affirming that the\n\naddition \"shall not be constnled to modify or supersede state law relating to\n\nmarriage.\" Id. at 17-18, 15 (quoting LAWS        OF 2006,   ch. 4, § 2 (codified at RCW\n\n49.60.020)). Third, Stutzman argues that because the WLAD protects both sexual\n\n\n\n       1\n         No one disputes that Ingersoll and Freed are gay men who sought to marry in\nrecognition of their nearly nine-year committed relationship. And Stutzman admits that\nshe is the \"sole owner and operator of Arlene's Flowers, Inc.,\" CP at 535, which is \"a\nWashington for-profit corporation engaged in the sale of goods and services, including\nflowers for weddings,\" to the public. Id. at 2, 7-8. Furthermore, Stutzman confirms that\nshe declined to do the flowers for Ingersoll's wedding because of her religious convictions.\n\n                                            12\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\norientation and religion, it requires that courts balance those rights when they\n\nconflict. 2 These arguments fail.\n\n              A. By refusing to provide services for a same-sex wedding, Stutzman\n                 discriminated on the basis of \"sexual orientation\" under the WLAD\n\n      Stutzman argues that the WLAD distinguishes between discrimination on the\n\nbasis of \"sexual orientation\"-which the statute prohibits-and discrimination\n\nagainst those who marry members of the same sex. But numerous courts-including\n\nour own-have rejected this kind of status/conduct distinction in cases involving\n\nstatutory and constitutional claims of discrimination. E.g., Hegwine v.

She draws our attention to two trial court decisions from Kentucky\nand Virginia. ld.\n\n                                             16\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nperson's sexual orientation is an unfair practice in violation of the WLAD, RCW\n\n49.60.215 (emphasis added).\n\n              B. There is no same-sex wedding exception to the WLAD's public\n                 accommodation provision, RCW 49.60.215\n\n      For the reasons given in Section I.A above, the plain language of RCW\n\n49.60.215 prohibits Stutzman's refusal to provide same-sex wedding services to\n\nIngersoll; such refusal constitutes discrimination on the basis of\"sexual orientation,\"\n\nin violation ofRCW 49.60.215. The same analysis applies to her corporation.\n\n      Stutzman asks us to read an implied same-sex wedding exception into this\n\nstatute. She argues that the legislature could not have intended to require equal\n\naccess to public accommodations for same-sex wedding services because when it\n\namended RCW 49.60.215 to prohibit sexual orientation discrimination, same-sex\n\nmarriage was \"illegal\" in Washington.\n\n      We reject this argument for two reasons. First, the WLAD already contains\n\nan express exemption to RCW 49.60.215 for \"religious organization[s]\" 7 that object\n\nto providing public accommodations for same-sex weddings. LAWS OF 2012, ch. 3,\n\n\n      7 This exemption does not extend to Arlene's Flowers, which does not meet the\nWLAD' s definition of a \"religious organization.\" I d. at § 1(7)(b) (defining \"religious\norganization\" to include \"entities whose principal purpose is the study, practice, or\nadvancement of religion,\" such as \"churches, mosques, synagogues, temples,\" etc.).\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n§ 1(5) (\"[n]o religious organization is required to provide accommodations,\n\nfacilities, advantages, privileges, services, or goods related to the solemnization or\n\ncelebration of a marriage\"). If the WLAD already excluded same-sex wedding\n\nservices from the public accommodations covered under RCW 49.60.215, this\n\nexemption would be superfluous. We interpret statutes to avoid such superfluity\n\nwhenever possible. Rivardv. State, 168 Wn.2d 775,783,231 P.3d 186 (2010) (in\n\ngiving meaning to ambiguous statutory provisions, \"we interpret a statute to give\n\neffect to all language, so as to render no portion meaningless or superfluous\").\n\n      Second, for purposes of the analysis Stutzman would like us to adopt, same-\n\nsex marriage has never been \"illegal\" in Washington. Stutzman cites our decision\n\nin Waggoner v. Ace Hardware Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1378740\"><a href=\"/opinion/1378740/waggoner-v-ace-hardware-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998),\n\nwhich rejected a claim of marital status discrimination by two people terminated\n\nfrom their jobs for cohabiting in contravention of their workplace antinepotism\n\npolicy. Waggoner argued that \"cohabitation\" fit within the meaning of the term\n\n\"marital status.\"    In examining this question of statutory interpretation, we\n\ndetermined that the plain meaning of the word \"marital\"-that is, pertaining to \"the\n\nstatus of being married, separated, divorced, or widowed\"-was sufficient to resolve\n\nthe question against petitioners. Id. at 753. We thus rejected Waggoner's argument\n\nbecause \"[ w]e presume legislative consistency when called upon to construe\n\n\n                                          18\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nstatutory enactments or new amendments to old ones\" and our legislature had\n\ncriminalized cohabitation prior to protecting marital status under the WLAD. Id. at\n\n754. Of significance here, we noted that cohabitation remained a crime for a full\n\nthree years after marital status was included as a protected status, and observed that\n\n\"[i]t would be most anomalous for the Legislature to criminalize and protect the\n\nsame conduct at the same time.\" !d. (emphasis added). Stutzman argues that we\n\nshould treat same-sex marriage the same way and hold that the legislature could not\n\npossibly have intended to protect that practice when it protected sexual orientation\n\nas a status.\n\n       But Stutzman's reliance on Waggoner is misplaced. Washington's Defense\n\nof Marriage Act did not criminalize same-sex marriage. Former RCW 9.79.120\n\n(1973), repealed by LAWS OF 1975, 1st Ex. Sess., ch. 260, § 9A.92.010(211). Rather,\n\nit codified, as a matter of state law, that the only legally recognized marriages in the\n\nState of Washington were those between a man and a woman. See LAWS            OF   1998,\n\nch. 1, § 2 (\"It is the intent of the legislature ... to establish public policy against\n\nsame-sex marriage in statutory law that clearly and definitively declares same-sex\n\nmarriages will not be recognized in Washington\"). Former RCW 26.04.010 (1998)\n\nenacted no criminal penalties for attempts by two individuals of the same sex to wed;\n\nthose individuals would simply not have had a valid \"marriage\" under Washington\n\n\n                                           19\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nlaw. See LAWS OF 1998, ch. 1, § 3. Former RCW 9.79.120, on the other hand,\n\nspecified that cohabitation was \"a gross misdemeanor.\" Waggoner, 134 Wn.2d at\n\n754 n.4. Our reasoning in Waggoner turned on the presence of a criminal statute\n\ntargeting the conduct at issue, which is absent here.\n\n      We hold that there is no same-sex wedding exception to the WLAD's public\n\naccommodations provisions.\n\n              C. The WLAD contains no mandate to balance religious rights against\n                 the rights of protected class members\n\n      In her final statutory argument regarding the WLAD, Stutzman contends that\n\nthe superior court erred by failing to balance her right to religious free exercise\n\nagainst Ingersoll's right to equal service. Stutzman argues that because the WLAD\n\nalso protects patrons of public accommodations from discrimination based on\n\n\"creed,\" RCW 49.60.030(1), and because this court has recognized that the WLAD\n\n\"sets forth a nonexclusive list of rights,\" Marquis v.

And,\n\nto the extent that Stutzman relies on Ishikawa, that case is inapposite: it dealt with\n\ntwo competing rights-the right to a fair trial and the right to open courts-both of\n\nwhich are constitutional, not statutory. 97 Wn.2d at 37.\n\n       When faced with a question of statutory interpretation, we \"'must not add\n\nwords where the legislature has chosen not to include them.\"' Lake v.

Certainly, she\n\nargues that she intends to communicate a message through her floral arrangements.\n\nBut the major contest is over whether Stutzman's intended communications actually\n\ncommunicated something to the public at large-whether her conduct was\n\n\"inherently expressive.\" Spence, 418 U.S. at 410-11; FAIR, 547 U.S. at 64. And\n\nher actions in creating floral arrangements for wedding ceremonies do not satisfy\n\nthis standard.\n\n      The leading case on the \"inherently expressive\" standard is FAIR.          The\n\nplaintiffs in FAIR-an association of law schools and faculty members-challenged\n\nthe constitutionality of a law that required higher education institutions to provide\n\nmilitary recruiters on campus with access to facilities and students that was at least\n\nequivalent to that of the most favorably treated nonmilitary recruiter. 547 U.S. at\n\n52, 55. The FAIR Court ruled that the law schools' conduct in denying military\n\nrecruiters most-favorable-recruiter access to students was not protected by the First\n\nAmendment because it was not \"inherently expressive.\" Id. at 66. It explained that\n\n\n                                         26\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nadditional speech would be required for an outside observer to understand that the\n\nschools' reason for denying military recruiters favorable access was to protest the\n\nmilitary's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy. Id.\n\n      Stutzman's refusal is analogous. The decision to either provide or refuse to\n\nprovide flowers for a wedding does not inherently express a message about that\n\nwedding.    As Stutzman acknowledged at deposition, providing flowers for a\n\nwedding between Muslims would not necessarily constitute an endorsement of\n\nIslam, nor would providing flowers for an atheist couple endorse atheism. Stutzman\n\nalso testified that she has previously declined wedding business on \"[m]ajor\n\nholidays, when we don't have the staff or if they want particular flowers that we\n\ncan't get in the time frame they need.\" CP at 120. Accordingly, an outside observer\n\nmay be left to wonder whether a wedding was declined for one of at least three\n\nreasons: a religious objection, insufficient staff, or insufficient stock.\n\n       Stutzman argues that FAIR is inapposite and that we should instead apply\n\nHurley v.

In fact, both cases involved state courts applying public\naccommodations laws in unusually expansive ways, such that an individual, private,\nexpressive association of people fell under the law. Dale, 530 U.S. at 657 (New Jersey\nCourt \"went a step further\" from an already \"extremely broad\" public accommodations law\nin applying it \"to a private entity without even attempting to tie the term 'place' to a\nphysical location\"); Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572 (noting that Massachusetts trial court applied\na public accommodations law \"in a peculiar way\" to encompass a privately sponsored\nparade). This case is distinguishable because Arlene's Flowers is a paradigmatic public\naccommodation.\n                                            28\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nthat the parade itself was a place of public accommodation under state\n\nantidiscrimination law-a ruling that the Supreme Court called \"peculiar.\" 515 U.S.\n\nat 561-62, 573.     The Court noted that the parade's \"inherent expressiveness\"\n\ndistinguished it from the places traditionally subject to public accommodations\n\nlaws-places that provide \"publicly available goods, privileges, and services.\" Id.\n\nat 568-72. Hurley is therefore unavailing to Stutzman: her store is the kind of public\n\naccommodation that has traditionally been subject to antidiscrimination laws.

That authority stands for\n\ntwo principles, neither of which is implicated here.\n\n      First, a law may fail the \"general applicability\" test, and thus trigger strict\n\nscrutiny, if it adopts a patchwork of specific exemptions that conspicuously omits\n\ncertain religiously motivated conduct.

Under a First Amendment free exercise analysis, the WLAD would trigger\n\nstrict scrutiny if it permitted that sort of discrimination only for nonreligious reasons,\n\nand thus indicated the government's preference for secular discrimination. But the\n\nWLAD does not do this.\n\n      Three of the alleged \"exemptions\" Stutzman cites have nothing at all to do\n\nwith the exemption she seeks (an exemption permitting discrimination in public\n\naccommodations). The exemption for \"[people] renting [out] certain multifamily\n\ndwellings,\" Br. of Appellants at 38 (citing RCW 49.60.040(5))-is not really an\n\nexemption from the WLAD at all.            RCW 49.60.040(5) defines a \"'[c]overed\n\nmultifamily dwelling'\" to exclude all buildings with fewer than four units and certain\n\nbuildings with no elevators.       In conjunction with RCW 49.60.222(2)(c), this\n\nprovision requires that \"covered multifamily dwellings\" be designed and constructed\n\nin compliance with state and federal disability access laws. This is not a license for\n\ncertain landlords to discriminate. With respect to public accommodations, the same\n\nis true of the WLAD' s \"exemptions\" for individuals employed in domestic service\n\nor by family members and for \"employers\" with fewer than eight employees. See\n\nBr. of Appellants at 38 (citing RCW 49.60.040(10), (11)). These exemptions protect\n\n\n                                            39\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nemployers from WLAD liability as employers-that is, liability to their\n\nemployees-in the context of family relationships, domestic service, and very small\n\nbusinesses; they have nothing to do with Stutzman's liability as the proprietor of a\n\npublic accommodation.      Compare RCW 49.60.180 (listing prohibited \"[u]nfair\n\npractices of employers,\" all of which discriminate against employees or potential\n\nemployees-not customers), with RCW 49.60.215 (listing prohibited \"[u]nfair\n\npractices of places of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, amusement\";\n\ncompletely omitting any reference to \"employers\"). Thus, these exemptions are\n\ndistinguishable from the exemptions at issue in Lukumi Babalu Aye, Blackhawk, or\n\nFraternal Order of Police because none is an exemption that Stutzman would\n\nactually like to invoke.\n\n      And the other \"exemption\" Stutzman identifies-for distinctly private\n\norganizations, Br. of Appellants at 38 (citing RCW 49.60.040(2))-does not\n\nundermine the purposes of the WLAD' s public accommodations provision: to\n\nprevent discrimination in public accommodations. Thus, it does not trigger strict\n\nscrutiny under a First Amendment free exercise analysis, either. Fraternal Order of\n\nPolice, 170 F.3d at 366 (contrasting exemptions that undermine a law's purpose-\n\nand thus trigger strict scrutiny-with exemptions for \"activities that [the\n\ngovernment] does not have an interest in preventing\"; holding that police\n\n\n                                         40\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\ndepartment's exemption permitting undercover officers to wear beards did not\n\ntrigger strict scrutiny because the governmental interest served by the shaving\n\nrequirement-making officers readily recognizable as officers-did not apply to\n\nundercover officers).\n\n      For these reasons, we reject Stutzman's claim that the WLAD, as applied to\n\nher, triggers strict scrutiny under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe WLAD is a neutral, generally applicable law subject to rational basis review.\n\nEmp 't Div., Dep 't ofHuman Res. of Or. v.

That was the year that the United States\n\nSupreme Court adopted rational basis review for claims that neutral, generally\n\napplicable laws (like the WLAD) incidentally burden religion, in Smith, 494 U.S. at\n\n878-90. Smith definitively repudiated strict scrutiny for neutral, generally applicable\n\nlaws prohibiting \"socially harmful conduct.\" I d. at 884-85. It reasoned that applying\n\nheightened scrutiny-which requires a balancing of governmental against personal\n\ninterests-would pose two problems. Id. First, it would vitiate the state's ability to\n\nregulate, allowing every individual \"'to become a law unto himself.\"' Id. at 885\n\n\n\n       17 Some scholarship distinguishes between the ''compelling interest\" test and \"strict\nscrutiny.\" E.g., Stephen A.

LEGAL HIST. 355, 359-60 (2008) (describing the \"compelling\ninterest\" standard as one of three barriers that legislation must overcome under strict\nscrutiny). But this court has always treated them as synonymous in religious free exercise\ncases. E.g., Backlund, 106 Wn.2d at 641 (\"Since [the plaintiffs] beliefs are protected by\nthe free exercise clause of the First Amendment, the burden of proof shifts to the Board to\nprove that (1) a compelling governmental interest justifies the regulation in question and\n(2) the regulation is the least restrictive imposition on the practice of his belief to satisfy\nthat interest.\" (citing United States v.

Second, it would entangle civil courts in religion by requiring them to\n\nevaluate the significance of a particular practice to a faith. Smith, 494 U.S. at 887\n\n(\"[r]epeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not\n\npresume to determine the place of a particular belief in a religion or the plausibility\n\nof a religious claim\"). The Smith Court reasoned that such a balancing test would\n\nbe incompatible with the religious pluralism that is fundamental to our national\n\nidentity. 494 U.S. at 888.\n\n      Smith's holding is limited in two ways. First, it left in place prior First\n\nAmendment case law applying the \"compelling interest\" balancing test where the\n\nstatute in question \"lent itself to individualized . . . assessment\"-e.g., an\n\nunemployment benefits statute under which an administrative court determines, on\n\na case-by-case basis, whether a person was fired for good cause. Id. at 884. In such\n\ncases, the Court explained that \"the State [already] has in place a system of\n\nindividual exemptions\"-thus, the challenged law is not \"generally applicable\" for\n\npurposes of First Amendment free exercise analysis. Id. Where an individual\n\nrequests a religious exemption from such a law, the government must have a\n\ncompelling reason for denying it. Id. Second, the Smith Court distinguished cases\n\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\ninvolving \"hybrid\" claims-e.g., challenges to laws that burdened both religious\n\nfreedom and another right such as free speech. !d. at 881 (collecting cases).\n\n      We revisited our article I, section 11 test following Smith in First Covenant\n\nChurch of Seattle v.

In that case, the plaintiff church argued that its designation as a\n\nhistorical landmark (subject to \"controls\" limiting alterations to its building) violated\n\nboth First Amendment and article I, section 11 protections. !d. at 208-09. In First\n\nCovenant I, we applied strict scrutiny to both constitutional challenges and held that\n\nthe zoning law was unconstitutional. 114 Wn.2d at 401-02, 410. On remand from\n\nthe United States Supreme Court following Smith, we addressed the state and federal\n\nfree exercise claims again.      Regarding the First Amendment claim, the First\n\nCovenant II court held that the challenged statute fell within both of the exceptions\n\nto rational basis review recognized in Smith: it created a system of \"individualized\n\nassessments\" and it raised \"hybrid\" constitutional concerns (by restricting speech as\n\nwell as religious free exercise). 120 Wn.2d at 214-17. The court therefore held that\n\nthe historical landmark statute was subject to strict scrutiny under the First\n\nAmendment. !d. at 217-18.\n\n      But after determining that the statute failed strict scrutiny as applied to the\n\nplaintiff church-because a city's purely aesthetic or cultural interest in preserving\n\n\n                                           45\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nhistorical landmarks is not compelling-the First Covenant II court went on to\n\nseparately analyze the church's article I, section 11 claim. Id. at 223 (\"The possible\n\nloss of significant architectural elements is a price we must accept to guarantee the\n\nparamount right of religious freedom ... [and] [a]lthough we might ... base our\n\ndecision solely on federal grounds, we decline to do so.\"). It performed a Gunwall 18\n\nanalysis and concluded that article I, section 11 \"extends broader protection than the\n\n[F]irst [A]mendment ... and precludes the City from imposing [the disputed]\n\nLandmarks Preservation Ordinance on First Covenant's church.\" Id. at 229-30.\n\n       Since that time, our court has addressed four article I, section 11 claims-all\n\nby churches challenging land use regulations 19-and has subjected the challenged\n\nlaw to strict scrutiny in each case. Thus, both before and after Smith and First\n\nCovenant II, we have applied the same four-prong analysis in an article I, section 11\n\n\n\n\n       18 State v.

And we have specifically held--in the context of a church's challenge\n\nto a zoning law-that article I, section 11 is more protective of religious free exercise\n\nthan the First Amendment is. E.g., First Covenant II, 120 Wn.2d at 224 (applying\n\nstrict scrutiny to zoning ordinance as a matter of state constitutional law because\n\n\"[ o ]ur state constitutional and common law history support a broader reading of\n\narticle [I], section 11, than of the First Amendment\"). 20\n\n\n\n\n       20\n          The attorney general correctly notes that this court has never held that a corporate\ndefendant such as Arlene's Flowers has a \"conscience\" or \"sentiment\" subject to article I,\nsection 11 protections. See Att'y Gen. Resp. Br. at 31 (\"Indeed the plain language of article\nI, section 11 guarantees its protections to 'every individual,' maldng no mention of\nprotection for businesses.\"); Att'y Gen.'s Ans. to Brs. of Amici Curiae at 19 (\"Neither\nDefendants nor their amici point to any Washington authority to support the notion that\nfor-profit corporations are protected by article I, section 11.\").

They maintain that a neutral health and safety regulation\n\nlike the WLAD creates no substantial burden on free exercise-and thus does not\n\ntrigger strict scrutiny-when it operates in the commercial marketplace. Stutzman\n\ncontends that under First Covenant II and its progeny, \"strict scrutiny applies even\n\nif the regulation 'indirectly burdens the exercise of religion.'\" Br. of Appellants at\n\n33 (quoting First Covenant II, 120 Wn.2d at 226).\n\n       We decline to resolve that dispute here because we conclude that Stutzman's\n\nfree exercise claim fails even under the test she advances. Even if article I, section\n\n11 provides Stutzman with the strongest possible protections, subjecting the WLAD\n\nto strict scrutiny in this case, her state constitutional challenge must still fail.\n\n              B.

CODE§ 2-1402.41, as applied to prohibit defendant\n\nuniversity from denying equal recognition and support to gay student groups,\n\nsurvived strict scrutiny in university's pre-Smith free exercise challenge: \"[t]o tailor\n\nthe Human Rights Act to require less of the University than equal access to its\n\n'facilities and services,' without regard to sexual orientation, would be to defeat its\n\ncompelling purpose[:] [t ]he District of Columbia's overriding interest in eradicating\n\nsexual orientation discrimination, if it is ever to be converted from aspiration to\n\nreality, requires that Georgetown equally distribute tangible benefits to the student\n\ngroups\"); see also Bob Jones Univ., 461 U.S. at 602-04 (federal government's denial\n\nof tax exempt status to schools that enforced religiously motivated racially\n\ndiscriminatory policies survived strict scrutiny: \"the Government has a fundamental,\n\noverriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education ... [and] that ..\n\n. interest substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on\n\npetitioners' exercise of their religious beliefs\").

And she maintains that the government therefore can't have\n\nany compelling interest in applying the WLAD to her shop.              In other words,\n\nStutzman contends that there is no reason to enforce the WLAD when, as she puts\n\nit, \"[N]o access problem exists.\" Br. of Appellants at 46.\n\n      We emphatically reject this argument. We agree with Ingersoll and Freed that\n\n\"[t]his case is no more about access to flowers than civil rights cases in the 1960s\n\nwere about access to sandwiches.\" Br. of Resp'ts Ingersoll and Freed at 32. As\n\nevery other court to address the question has concluded, public accommodations\n\nlaws do not simply guarantee access to goods or services. Instead, they serve a\n\nbroader societal purpose: eradicating barriers to the equal treatment of all citizens in\n\nthe commercial marketplace. Were we to carve out a patchwork of exceptions for\n\nostensibly justified discrimination,2 1 that purpose would be fatally undermined.\n\n\n       21\n         Stutzman argues that discrimination cannot be \"invidious\"-and thus subject to\ngovernmental prohibition-if it is based on religious beliefs. Br. of Appellants at 40-43.\nBut she cites no relevant legal authority for this novel theory. She also argues that the\ngovernment has no compelling interest in forcing her to speak or associate with Ingersoll\nor any other customer. But, as explained elsewhere in this opinion, the WLAD does not\nimplicate Stutzman's rights of speech or association.\n                                           52\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      In conclusion, we assume without deciding that strict scrutiny applies to the\n\nWLAD in this article I, section 11 challenge, and we hold that the law satisfies that\n\nstandard.\n\n      V.       As Applied in This Case, the WLAD Does Not Violate Stutzman's\n               Right to Free Association under the First Amendment to the United\n               States Constitution\n\n      Stutzman argues that the WLAD, as applied by the trial court in her case,\n\nviolates her First Amendment right to freedom of association. But to support that\n\nargument, she relies exclusively on cases addressing membership in private clubs:\n\nBoy Scouts of America v.

This opinion addresses Stutzman's free expression claim\nelsewhere.\n                                          53\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nof a \"clearly commercial entit[y].\"); Hurley, 515 U.S. at 572, 571 (state\n\nantidiscrimination law at issue traditionally applied to \"the provision of publicly\n\navailable goods, privileges, and services\" by, \"[a]t common law, innkeepers, smiths,\n\nand others who 'made profession of a public employment\"'; but it would be\n\n\"peculiar\" to extend that law beyond the customer service context so that it applied\n\nto the inherently expressive conduct of marching in a parade).\n\n         In fact, the United States Supreme Court has even held that states may enforce\n\nantidiscrimination laws against certain private organizations, defined by particular\n\ngoals and ideologies, if the enforcement will not impair the group's ability to pursue\n\nthose goals and espouse those ideologies. Roberts, 468 U.S. at 628 (even though\n\nFirst Amendment protects private groups, those groups are subject to\n\nantidiscrimination laws to the extent that enforcement \"will [not] change the content\n\nor impact of the organization's speech\").\n\n         But the Supreme Court has never held that a commercial enterprise, open to\n\nthe general public, is an '\"expressive association'\" for purposes ofFirst Amendment\n\nprotections, Dale, 530 U.S. at 648. We therefore reject Stutzman's free association\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\n      VI.     As Applied in This Case, the WLAD Does Not Violate Stutzman's\n              Constitutional Protections under the \"Hybrid Rights\" Doctrine\n\n      Stutzman also argues that the WLAD, as applied to her in this case, triggers\n\nstrict scrutiny because it implicates \"hybrid rights.\" Br. of Appellants at 40. As\n\nnoted above, a law triggers strict scrutiny if it burdens both religious free exercise\n\nand another fundamental right such as speech or association. First Covenant II, 120\n\nWn.2d at 217-18 (\"[t]he less protective free exercise standard set forth in Smith ...\n\ndoes not apply because the case presents a 'hybrid situation': First Covenant's claim\n\ninvolves the free exercise clause in conjunction with free speech\" (citing Smith, 494\n\nU.S. at 904 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment))). But Stutzman's claim fails\n\nfor two reasons. First, the only fundamental right implicated in this case is the right\n\nto religious free exercise. Stutzman's rights to speech and association are not\n\nburdened. See supra Parts II, V. Second, even if the WLAD does trigger strict\n\nscrutiny in this case, it satisfies that standard. See supra Section IV.B.\n\n      VII.    The Trial Court Did Not Err by Imposing Personal Liability on\n              Stutzman Instead of Solely on Her Corporation, Arlene's Flowers Inc.\n\n      In addition to finding that Stutzman violated the WLAD, the trial court also\n\nfound that Stutzman violated the CPA. This is because the WLAD provides that an\n\nact of public accommodation discrimination is an \"unfair practice\" and a per se\n\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nviolation ofthe CPA. RCW 49.60.030(3). 23 Stutzman concedes that if she violated\n\nthe WLAD, then Arlene's Flowers is liable for a CPA violation.\n\n      But Stutzman argues that she cannot be personally liable for violating the CPA\n\nbecause (1) she kept her affairs separate from Arlene's Flowers' and (2) no\n\nWashington court has ever applied the \"responsible-corporate-officer doctrine\"\n\noutside the fraud context.

In Grayson, this\n\ncourt held that the defendant could be personally liable for his company's CPA\n\nviolation even though there were no grounds for piercing the corporate veil. 92\n\nWn.2d at 553-54. This directly contradicts Stutzman's theory that she cannot be\n\npersonally liable under the CPA unless she commingled her finances with Arlene's\n\n\n\n\n      23\n         The trial court also found that Stutzman's actions violated the CPA-because they\nwere an \"'unfair or deceptive act or practice . . . occurring in trade or commerce, and\n[impacting the] public interest'\"-even if she did not also violate the WLAD. CP at 2634-\n37 (quoting State v. Kaiser, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

This ruling is\nquestionable, but because we conclude that Stutzman did violate the WLAD, and because\nStutzman did not assign error to this ruling in her opening brief, we do not address it.\n\n                                           56\n\fNo. 91615-2\n\n\n\nFlowers'.

Discrimination based on same-sex marriage\n\nconstitutes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. We therefore hold that\n\nthe conduct for which Stutzman was cited and fined in this case-refusing her\n\ncommercially marketed wedding floral services to Ingersoll and Freed because theirs\n\nwould be a same-sex wedding-constitutes sexual orientation discrimination under\n\nthe WLAD. We also hold that the WLAD may be enforced against Stutzman\n\nbecause it does not infringe any constitutional protection. As applied in this case,\n\nthe WLAD does not compel speech or association.              And assuming that it\n\nsubstantially burdens Stutzman's religious free exercise, the WLAD does not violate\n\nher right to religious free exercise under either the First Amendment or article I,\n\nsection 11 because it is a neutral, generally applicable law that serves our state\n\ngovernment's compelling interest in eradicating discrimination in public\n\naccommodations.
