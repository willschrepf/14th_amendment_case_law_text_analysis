BYERS, SENIOR JUDGE\n\f                                      OPINION\n\n\n\n             In this capital case, the petitioner, Nicholas Todd Sutton, appeals as of right\n\nfrom the judgment of the Criminal Court of Morgan County denying his post-conviction\n\npetition. In 1986, the petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to\n\ndeath by electrocution. The petitioner’s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct\n\nappeal by the Supreme Court. See State v. Sutton, 761 S.W.2d 763 (Tenn. 1988), reh’g\n\ndenied (Tenn. 1988), and cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1031, 110 S.Ct. 3287, 111 L.Ed.2d 796\n\n(1990).\n\n\n\n             On December 14, 1990, the petitioner, through counsel, filed a petition for\n\npost-conviction relief, and an amended petition was filed on January 2, 1992. Thereafter,\n\nSenior Judge William H. Inman was appointed to hear the petition on November 18, 1994.\n\nIn March 1996, Judge Inman granted the petitioner’s motion requesting that he recuse\n\nhimself, and Judge Gary R. Wade was appointed to hear the petition. The post-conviction\n\nhearing was held over a period of five days from October 9 to October 14, 1996. On\n\nOctober 23, 1996, the post-conviction court denied post-conviction relief.\n\n\n\n             On appeal, the petitioner raises the following issues:\n\n\n\n      1.     Whether the state abused the discovery process, mislead and\n             misdirected the energies of petitioner’s attorney, and\n             concealed the state’s major witnesses, and whether the post-\n             conviction court erred in concluding that the issue had been\n             previously determined.\n\n      2.     Whether the trial court failed to regulate the discovery process,\n             and whether the post-conviction court erred in concluding that\n             the issue had been waived or previously determined.\n\n      3.     Whether excessive courtroom security denied the petitioner his\n             right to a fair trial, and whether the post-conviction court erred\n             in concluding that the issue had been waived or previously\n             determined.\n\n      4.     Whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of\n             counsel at the guilt and penalty phases of his trial.\n\n      5.     Whether the state falsely portrayed inmate safety and security\n             at the prison.\n\n                                             1\n\f       6.     Whether the state manufactured a prior statement by inmate\n              Lumbert for the post-conviction hearing, and whether the post-\n              conviction court erred by failing to address the issue.\n\n       7.     Whether the state failed to disclose exculpatory evidence in\n              violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10\n              L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150,\n              92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972).\n\n       8.     Whether the death penalty statutes are unconstitutional.\n\n       9.     Whether imposition of the death penalty in this case would be\n              arbitrary and capricious.\n\n\n\n              Having reviewed the record, including the record from the petitioner’s direct\n\nappeal, we affirm the judgment of the post-conviction court.\n\n\n\n                                       Background\n\n\n\n              The proof, as set forth in the Supreme Court’s decision, State v. Sutton, 761\n\nS.W.2d 763, 765-66, established that the petitioner and co-defendants Charles A.\n\nFreeman and Thomas A. Street were residents of Guild 6 at the Morgan County Regional\n\nCorrectional Facility (“MCRCF”) on the day of the murder. The victim, Carl Estep, was a\n\nresident of Guild 5.\n\n\n\n              On January 15, 1985, when Estep was murdered, there was no correctional\n\nofficer in Guild 5 between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m. During a routine \"shakedown\" after 10:00\n\na.m., correctional officers found the body of Estep lying on the lower bunk of his cell.\n\nThere were signs of a struggle and blood was observed on the wall, the bed covers, and\n\non Estep's body. Attempts to revive Estep were unsuccessful. The entire facility was then\n\n\"locked down,\" and all inmates in Guild 5 were interviewed.\n\n\n\n              Estep, who had been serving a sentence for child molesting, had been\n\nstabbed thirty-eight times in the chest and neck. Most of the wounds were superficial, but\n\nnine were potentially fatal, having penetrated Estep's lungs, vena cava, and carotid artery.\n\nThe examining pathologist testified that this latter wound would have caused death in a\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fmatter of minutes. There were seven defensive wounds on Estep's hands and right arm\n\nand a wound to the back of his head caused by a blow. It was the opinion of the\n\npathologist that from the size of the wounds, two knives had been used by Estep's\n\nattackers. On the bottom bunk, investigating officers found two homemade knives, which\n\nmatched the wounds on Estep's body. A later investigation of the cell uncovered a third\n\nknife hidden under a lamp beside Estep's bed.\n\n\n\n              The testimony of four inmates, sometimes contradictory and evasive, linked\n\nthe petitioner to the murder. The first to testify was Harold Meadows, a resident of Guild\n\n5. He testified that he was sitting in the day room area when he saw the petitioner and\n\nStreet enter the guild and go straight to Estep's cell. He stated that each day between 9:30\n\na.m. and shortly after 10:00 a.m. there was a period of five to ten minutes when no guards\n\nwere in Guild 5 due to a duty change. It was during this time on January 15, that he\n\nobserved the petitioner and Street enter the guild. When they entered Estep's cell, his\n\nroommate immediately came out and shortly thereafter the volume of the tv or radio\n\nincreased, and Meadows heard a scream, and the petitioner and Street came out. When\n\nquestioned by correctional officers immediately after the incident, Meadows told them what\n\nhe had seen and identified the petitioner and Street from a photographic line-up. Meadows\n\nfurther testified that on Sunday, January 13, he had seen Estep having a \"physical\n\ndiscussion\" with the petitioner and Street, during which the petitioner held a knife to Estep's\n\nthroat.\n\n\n\n              Another resident of Guild 5, Estel Green, testified that he was standing in\n\nfront of the door to his cell, right next to Estep's cell, when he saw the petitioner and\n\nanother inmate go inside Estep's cell. Green then went into his cell. When he came back\n\nout, he saw the other men in the guild moving toward the back away from Estep's cell.\n\nGreen moved away with them and heard Estep \"holler out. He said, 'Don't do that; please\n\ndon't do that.' and then he hollered louder, he hollered, 'Somebody help me; somebody\n\nplease help me.' and that was all I heard.\" Green was not able to see who left Estep's cell.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f              Ralph Edward Scates was a resident of Guild 3, but he worked as a laundry\n\nman in Guild 1. Scates testified that he had a casual conversation with Street while Street\n\nwas confined to Guild 1 for investigative purposes after the killing. Street admitted to\n\nScates that \"he [Street] cut him ... he stuck him, cut his throat.\" Street said that homemade\n\nknives had been used and that he had tried to flush his down the commode in his cell in\n\nGuild 6. Scates stated that the petitioner had told him, \"The SB got exactly what he\n\ndeserved.\"\n\n\n\n              The last inmate to testify for the state was Cary Scoggins. He testified that\n\nEstep was a marijuana dealer at the facility and had sold the defendants some \"bad\n\nmerchandise\" and had refused to refund the defendants' money. He testified that after the\n\ndefendants took Estep's watch and some other articles, Estep had threatened to kill the\n\npetitioner. Scoggins, a resident of Guild 6, happened to be in Guild 5 on the morning of\n\nJanuary 15 between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. He stated that he saw the petitioner, Street,\n\nand Freeman come into the guild and enter Estep's cell. He looked through the window\n\nin the door of Estep's cell, a vertical window four inches by thirteen inches and saw all\n\nthree defendants standing in front of the bunk bed with their backs to the window. He saw\n\nEstep try to get up from the bottom bunk and the petitioner and Freeman pulled knives.\n\nThe petitioner started to stab Estep, who screamed. Scoggins stated that the petitioner\n\n\"just kept on stabbing\" about sixteen times. The three defendants then washed their hands\n\nin the sink. Scoggins then moved away from the door and left the guild before the\n\ndefendants did.\n\n\n\n              In order to contradict Scoggins' testimony, co-defendant Freeman presented\n\nthe testimony of Gary Lumbert, Scoggins' cellmate. Lumbert testified that Scoggins was\n\nworking with him in the prison library at the time Estep was murdered.\n\n\n\n              The state recalled James Worthington, the administrative assistant to the\n\nwarden at the time of the killing, and he testified that he had investigated the murder. He\n\nstated that Lumbert had told him that he was present in Guild 6 immediately after Estep\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fhad been killed, and that he observed the petitioner and Street enter the guild, remove\n\ntheir clothes, and place their clothes in the laundry. Lumbert also told Worthington that the\n\npetitioner bragged \"about stabbing Carl Estep twenty-some times.\"\n\n\n\n              On January 15, two garbage bags found outside Guild 8 were brought to\n\nWorthington, one containing trash and the other prison clothing. A telephone pass for\n\nFreeman was found in one pair of the pants. F.B.I. analysis of the debris from the clothing\n\nin the garbage bag revealed a hair consistent with that of the victim on a pair of button-fly\n\njeans and a hair consistent with that of Freeman on one of the jackets. A forensic\n\nserologist employed by the T.B.I. testified that she was able to identify a human blood stain\n\nmatching the victim's blood type on the sleeve of one of the jackets, one of the knives, and\n\na work shirt. She also found human blood on one of the jackets, a pair of zipper-fly blue\n\njeans and an elastic bandage. Tests were inconclusive as to whether human blood was\n\non the other knife.\n\n\n\n              Based on this proof, the jury found the petitioner guilty of first-degree murder.\n\n\n\n              At the sentencing hearing, the state presented proof that the petitioner had\n\npreviously been convicted of first-degree murder. The defense presented the testimony\n\nof Charles Burchett, the Director of Student Conduct at the University of Tennessee, his\n\nwife, a semi-retired school teacher, and their son, Charles Burchett, Jr., who was a real\n\nestate agent. The Burchetts testified that they had known the petitioner since he was in\n\nhigh school and that they visited him in prison regularly. The defense also presented the\n\ntestimony of two inmates. Eddie O’Donnell, the petitioner’s cellmate in Guild 6, testified\n\nthat on January 14, while they were eating in the dining hall, the petitioner asked O’Donnell\n\nto tell him if Estep came toward him. When Estep came in, O’Donnell nodded at the\n\npetitioner, who stood up. Estep then walked the other way. James “Buddy” Williams, also\n\nan inmate, testified that he did not have any conversations with the petitioner about this\n\nmatter, despite having previously told defense counsel that he had in fact had\n\nconversations with the petitioner. Williams refused to answer any further questions.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f              The jury sentenced the petitioner to death by electrocution based on its\n\nfinding that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to outweigh the three\n\naggravating circumstances: (1) prior conviction of a violent felony, (2) the murder was\n\nheinous, atrocious, or cruel, and (3) the murder was committed while the petitioner was in\n\na place of lawful confinement. T.C.A. § 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), (8) (repealed 1989).\n\n\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n\n\n              In post-conviction proceedings, the petitioner must prove the allegations\n\ncontained in his petition by a preponderance of the evidence. Oliphant v. State, 806\n\nS.W.2d 215, 218 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). Findings of fact and conclusions of law made\n\nby the trial court are given the weight of a jury verdict, and this Court is bound by those\n\nfindings unless the evidence contained in the record preponderates otherwise. Butler v.\n\nState, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899 (Tenn. 1990). This Court may not reweigh or reevaluate the\n\nevidence or substitute its inferences for those drawn by the trial court.        Questions\n\nconcerning the credibility of witnesses and weight and value to be given their testimony are\n\nfor resolution by the trial court. Black v. State, 794 S.W.2d 752, 755 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1990).\n\n\n\n                              I. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n\n\n              In his first issue, the petitioner contends that he was denied a fair trial\n\nbecause the state abused the discovery process, mislead and misdirected the energies of\n\npetitioner’s attorney, and concealed its major witnesses. The petitioner submits that the\n\npost-conviction court erred in finding this issue to be previously determined.\n\n\n\n              Specifically, the petitioner argues that he was unable to establish his\n\nprosecutorial misconduct claim on direct appeal because he was denied access to material\n\ndocuments which would have demonstrated an intentional decision by the state to\n\nmisdirect defense counsel. Second, the petitioner argues that he was unable to show in\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthe prior proceedings how he was prejudiced by the intentional wrongdoing of the state\n\nbecause his attorney could not challenge his own ineffectiveness without creating a conflict\n\nof interest.\n\n\n\n               Under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act governing this petition, a petitioner\n\ncould raise all constitutional claims except those which had been previously determined,\n\nwaived, or barred by the statute of limitations.        The statutory definitions under the\n\napplicable Post-Conviction Procedure Act for previous determination and waiver were as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n               (a) A ground for relief is “previously determined” if a court of\n               competent jurisdiction has ruled on the merits after a full and\n               fair hearing.\n\n               (b)(1) A ground for relief is “waived” if the petitioner knowingly\n               and understandingly failed to present it for determination in any\n               proceeding before a court of competent jurisdiction in which\n               the ground could have been presented.\n\n               (2) There is a rebuttable presumption that a ground for relief\n               not raised in any such proceeding which was held was waived.\n\n\n\nT.C.A. § 40-30-112 (1990).\n\n\n\n               In House v. State, 911 S.W.2d 705 (Tenn. 1995), our Supreme Court held\n\nthat “a ‘full and fair hearing’ sufficient to support a finding of previous determination occurs\n\nif a petitioner is given the opportunity to present proof and argument.” Id. at 706. The\n\nburden is on the post-conviction petitioner to allege facts to overcome the application of\n\nprocedural barriers. Smith v. State, 814 S.W.2d 45, 49 (Tenn. 1991); see also T.C.A. §\n\n40-30-104(10)(1990).\n\n\n\n               The post-conviction court concluded that the petitioner failed to rebut the\n\nfinding that the issue had been previously determined on direct appeal, where our\n\nSupreme Court held:\n\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f      The defendant Sutton next alleges that he was denied the right to a fair trial\n      because of the conduct of the State in not supplying him sufficient notice of\n      the witnesses which would be used against him. He argues that by providing\n      lists of numerous prospective witnesses, ranging from 80 to 47 names, many\n      of whom were inmates scattered throughout the State correctional system\n      and most of whom the State, defendant alleges, had no intention of calling,\n      denied him his right to effective counsel because defense counsel was\n      unable to interview all these witnesses and investigate the case fully.\n      Nothing in the record supports this allegation. When defense counsel\n      pointed out the problems he was having in reaching all the witnesses, the\n      court granted a continuance.\n\n\n\nSutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 769.\n\n\n\n             Despite the petitioner’s claims, a full review of the record does not establish\n\nintentional wrongdoing on the part of the state.      Worthington testified that he was\n\nresponsible for the prison’s internal investigation into the murder of Estep. On the day of\n\nthe murder, Worthington and Clarence Robbins, the investigator for the district attorney\n\ngeneral’s office, conducted intensive interviews of everyone in Guild 5. Worthington was\n\nresponsible for transcribing and cataloging all of the statements.\n\n\n\n              In the course of the investigation, Worthington submitted to the district\n\nattorney general’s office a list of possible witnesses and a summary of each witness’\n\npotential testimony. Worthington kept a notebook which included summaries, statements,\n\nand documents regarding each person who was interviewed.              In addition, he kept\n\nmiscellaneous files that included rap sheets, different information, institutional file\n\ndocuments on each of the defendants and some of the witnesses, and notes he had made\n\nduring the investigation and interviews.\n\n\n\n              The list of potential witnesses was typed and sent to the district attorney\n\ngeneral’s office around June 3, 1985. Worthington testified that the entire list was given\n\nto the defense as a good faith effort so the defense would have a complete list of the\n\ninmates who had been interviewed. A shorter list was given in August 1985, and another\n\nwas given in September 1985. Worthington kept inmates on the witness list because he\n\nthought that once some of them were released from prison they might be willing to talk.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fHe also believed that the defense attorneys should be given an opportunity to speak with\n\nthese inmates because they might tell defense counsel more than they would tell the\n\nprison officials.\n\n\n\n               Roger Delp, an assistant district attorney general who prosecuted the case,\n\ntestified that the long list of potential witnesses was given to defense counsel to ensure\n\nthat the trial judge would not refuse to allow a witness to testify because the name had not\n\nbeen given to the defense. The state was concerned that some inmates who had been in\n\na position to have information about the homicide but were not talking might be willing to\n\ntalk to defense counsel or might decide to talk to the state at a later date. The state was\n\nalso trying to protect inmates from potential retaliation.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner was represented at trial by John Appman. Because the state’s\n\nlist of potential witnesses was long and because the inmates were constantly being\n\ntransferred to other facilities, Appman spent unnecessary time and trouble investigating\n\nthe case. Bruce Fox, appointed counsel for co-defendant Street, confirmed that it was\n\ndifficult to prepare for trial because the state’s witness list was so extensive. He and\n\nAppman did most of the preparation for trial, traveling in Appman’s private plane to\n\ninterview witnesses who were incarcerated at various correctional facilities across the\n\nstate. They were also assisted by Appman’s paralegal.\n\n\n\n               In order to tell which witnesses the state was going to call and to have an\n\nunderstanding of the state’s case, Appman believed he needed to review Worthington’s\n\ninvestigative records. However, even if he had been able to obtain a shorter list of\n\npotential witnesses, Appman testified that he still would have attempted to talk to anyone\n\nwho might have benefitted the case. He and Herb Moncier filed a motion with the trial\n\ncourt in an attempt to get Worthington’s notebook, however, the motion was denied.\n\nThereafter, they filed a lawsuit in the chancery court of Davidson County seeking to force\n\nWorthington to turn over his investigative records under the Public Records Act. Relief was\n\ndenied by the chancery court and by the Supreme Court on appeal. See Appman v.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fWorthington, 746 S.W.2d 165 (Tenn. 1987).\n\n\n\n              Without Worthington’s notebook, Appman testified that he was unable to fully\n\nadvise the petitioner regarding the strength of the state’s case. Although the petitioner\n\ntestified that he would not have accepted the state’s offer of a life sentence because it was\n\nconditional on offers to the co-defendants, Appman believed that the information in\n\nWorthington’s notebook would have assisted him in his attempt to convince the petitioner\n\nto accept the offer. Despite the foreclosure of reviewing Worthington’s notebook, Appman\n\nwas able to interview all the inmates who eventually testified at trial on behalf of the state.\n\nHe was also able to review each of these witnesses’ statement to Worthington as Jencks\n\nmaterial prior to cross-examination.\n\n\n\n              A review of the testimony and of Worthington’s notebook does not reveal that\n\nthe state intentionally misdirected defense counsel, and this argument fails to rebut the\n\nstatutory presumption that this issue has been previously determined.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that the issue should not be barred as\n\npreviously determined because counsel could not have raised his own ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. However, the issue of whether the state’s actions denied the\n\npetitioner the right to effective counsel was raised and addressed by the Supreme Court.\n\nSutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 769. Moreover, the record reflects that Appman took every action\n\npossible to obtain Worthington’s notebook, including the filing of a civil law suit.\n\nAccordingly, even if the issue was not previously determined, the petitioner has failed to\n\nshow that counsel’s actions were deficient. See Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936\n\n(Tenn. 1975).\n\n\n\n                          II. Regulation of Discovery Process\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in finding that the\n\nissue of whether the trial court failed to regulate the discovery process was previously\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fdetermined, waived, or without merit. As to a finding of waiver, the petitioner contends that\n\nit was not raised due to ineffective assistance of counsel and that the material facts\n\nsupporting his claim were not available despite efforts to obtain access to the information.\n\nFurthermore, the petitioner contends that if the trial court had at a minimum reviewed\n\nWorthington’s notebook or included it in the record, it would have shown that the state had\n\nin fact prepared a shorter, detailed witness list which set forth the anticipated witnesses at\n\ntrial and their anticipated testimony.\n\n\n\n              As noted in the Supreme Court’s opinion, “[t]he evidence in the record does\n\nnot preponderate against the trial court's finding on the motion for new trial that there was\n\nno bad faith on the State's part in responding to the discovery requests, that the defendant\n\nwas not damaged by any of the delays in this case, and that under the circumstances all\n\nmatters were addressed within a reasonable time.”            Sutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 768.\n\nAccordingly, this issue has been previously determined. See T.C.A. § 40-30-112(a)(1990).\n\nFurthermore, the petitioner cannot succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nbecause the Supreme Court ruled that matters of discovery were handled appropriately.\n\nThus, the petitioner has not shown prejudice. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\n\n\n\n                                  III. Courtroom Security\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in\n\nconcluding that the issue of excessive security in the courtroom was previously determined,\n\nwaived, or without merit. In his post-conviction petition, the petitioner claimed that the state\n\nused the extraordinary courtroom security as a prop, that he was denied a fair trial as a\n\nresult of the excessive courtroom security, that the trial court failed to regulate the\n\nexcessive courtroom security, and that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to limit the\n\nexcessive security, object to its use as a prop, or properly present the issue in the motion\n\nfor new trial and on direct appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f              Regarding this issue, Charles E. Jones, now warden at MCRCF, testified that\n\nhe was in charge of courtroom security during the petitioner’s trial. According to Jones, the\n\ngoal was to provide security during the trial and to ensure that inmates were transported\n\nin a timely manner, however, there was no written plan or order. Uniformed officers armed\n\nwith shotguns were stationed at each corner of the courthouse. Two officers with a hand\n\nheld metal detector were stationed outside the door to the courtroom.               Inside the\n\ncourtroom, officers were stationed at each door. Three more officers were stationed in the\n\nfront row directly behind the defendants. One officer was positioned to backup the three\n\nofficers by the defendants, one was next to the jury, and two were in the balcony. Some\n\nof the officers were in uniform, and all the officers were armed with the exception of the\n\nthree officers directly behind the defendants. One street by the courthouse was blocked\n\noff, and the officers used it for parking and unloading inmates.\n\n\n\n              Judge Eugene Eblen, who presided over the trial, testified that the officers\n\nin the courtroom were not overly conspicuous. Considering that there were three inmates\n\non trial and that many of the witnesses were also inmates, Judge Eblen believed that the\n\nsecurity was appropriate.\n\n\n\n              Contrary to this testimony, Fox, counsel for co-defendant Street, testified that\n\nthe courthouse was an “armed fortress.” Charles Burchett, who attended the trial and\n\ntestified on behalf of the petitioner at the sentencing hearing, testified that he was amazed\n\nat the number of armed officers.\n\n\n\n              On the general issue of courtroom security, the post-conviction court made\n\nthese findings:\n\n\n\n       Even if the issue had not been previously determined or waived, the proof at\n       the evidentiary hearing simply did not establish this as a ground for relief.\n       Obviously courtroom security is necessary when three prison inmates are on\n       trial. All of the key witnesses were inmates as well. The environment at the\n       trial, due to all this, was certainly not ideal. Nonetheless, the trial court took\n       measures to reduce any prejudicial effect. The defendants wore certain\n       clothes, their hands were free, and measures were taken to hide from the\n       jury the shackles on their feet. Moreover, Morgan County, with two state\n\n\n                                              12\n\f         prison facilities in 1986, is more likely than other counties to be desensitized\n         to a possibly coercive atmosphere.\n\n\n\n                Before introducing the homemade knives into evidence, General Harvey\n\nplaced them on the defense table so that defense counsel would have an opportunity to\n\nexamine the knives. This was done even though defense counsel had been instructed to\n\nonly use felt tip pens, not pencils, so that the defendants could not use the pencils as\n\nweapons in taking hostages. Appman testified that he reacted by jerking away from the\n\ntable because he was afraid of becoming a hostage. According to Appman, it was a tense\n\nmoment in the courtroom. Being startled, Appman did not make a motion for a mistrial or\n\nraise the issue at that time.\n\n\n\n                Judge Eblen testified that it is common practice for lawyers to approach\n\nopposing counsel and present an exhibit before it is introduced into evidence. When the\n\nprosecutor placed the homemade knives on the defense table, Judge Eblen saw Appman\n\njump, and he heard an officer pull a gun, although he did not see any guns drawn.\n\nAccording to Judge Eblen, the courtroom quickly quieted down, and the jury seemed to get\n\na “smile” out of the incident. Judge Eblen believed that he told the prosecutor not to do it\n\nagain.\n\n\n\n                The post-conviction court accredited the testimony of Judge Eblen on this\n\nissue:\n\n\n\n         Moreover, Judge Eblen testified that this was really “not a big event in\n         Morgan County” and that the “officers were not overly conspicuous.” While\n         Judge Eblen expressed some concern about the incident wherein an\n         assistant district attorney general placed several knives at the table occupied\n         by the defendants and their counsel, John Appman reacted with some\n         surprise. The record demonstrates, however, that there were curative\n         instructions. It was Judge Eblen’s opinion that the incident did not affect the\n         results of the trial. This court accredits that account.\n\n\n\n                Regarding the placing of knives on defense table, the post-conviction court\n\nproperly held that the issue has been previously determined. T.C.A. § 40-30-112(a)\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f(1990). In fact, Jones was called to testify about the courtroom security at the hearing on\n\nthe motions for new trial. Jones, who was in charge of courtroom security, testified that\n\nthere were ten to fourteen guards in the courtroom, some of whom were in civilian clothes.\n\nWhile some of the guards had pistols, no one in the courtroom had a shotgun. When the\n\nknives were placed on the table, the officers in the courtroom reached for their guns,\n\nhowever, no pistols were drawn. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court ruled:\n\n\n\n       The defendant also alleges prosecutorial misconduct by the Assistant District\n       Attorney General. A knife, identified by State's witness James Worthington\n       as a weapon found in Estep's cell after the murder, was placed on the\n       defense table for inspection by counsel before passing it to the jury. Seeing\n       the knife within reach of the defendants, a number of the correctional officers\n       in the courtroom responded by reaching for their weapons. Defendant insists\n       that the reactions by the guards prejudiced him and deprived him of the\n       \"physical indicia of innocence.\" After the incident, the court instructed the\n       State to have defense counsel examine the weapons at the State's table.\n       The jury knew that the defendants were inmates and it probably came as no\n       surprise to the jurors that they would be closely watched and guarded. The\n       record reflects that only one such incident occurred. We do not find that this\n       incident could have so prejudiced the defendant as to deny him a fair trial.\n       We find no reversible error.\n\n\n\nState v. Sutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 769.\n\n\n\n              Furthermore, as held by the post-conviction court, all other claims regarding\n\nexcessive security in the courtroom were waived by the petitioner’s failure to raise them\n\npreviously. T.C.A. § 40-30-112(b)(1) (1990). Finally, the petitioner has failed to meet his\n\nburden to show ineffective assistance of counsel regarding this issue. As stated earlier,\n\non appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief, the findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw made by the trial court are given the weight of a jury verdict, and this Court is bound\n\nby those findings unless the evidence contained in the record preponderates otherwise.\n\nButler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899. Questions concerning the credibility of witnesses\n\nand weight and value to be given their testimony are for resolution by the trial court. Black\n\nv. State, 794 S.W.2d 752, 755.\n\n\n\n              In the present case, the post-conviction court accredited the testimony of\n\nJudge Eblen regarding whether the security was excessive or prejudicial at the petitioner’s\n\n\n                                             14\n\ftrial. Having reviewed the record, we do not find that the evidence preponderates against\n\nthis finding, and thus, the petitioner has failed to establish prejudice. Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                          IV. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\n\n               The petitioner raises several issues regarding the effectiveness of defense\n\ncounsel pre-trial, at trial, post-trial, and on direct appeal. When a petitioner seeks post-\n\nconviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must first establish\n\nthat the services rendered or the advice given was below \"the range of competence\n\ndemanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\" Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936. Second,\n\nhe must show that the deficiencies \"actually had an adverse effect on the defense.\"\n\nStrickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067 (1984). There must\n\nbe a reasonable probability that but for counsel’s error, the result of the proceeding would\n\nhave been different. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068; Best\n\nv. State, 708 S.W.2d 421, 422 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1985). Should the petitioner fail to\n\nestablish either factor, he is not entitled to relief.\n\n\n\n(A) Failure to File a Motion to Strike “Lawful Custody” Aggravating Circumstance\n\n\n\n               The petitioner contends that counsel was ineffective by failing to research,\n\ninvestigate, and/or file a motion seeking to strike the aggravating circumstance that the\n\npetitioner was in lawful custody at the time of the offense. Despite defense counsel’s self-\n\ndefense theory that the victim’s death threats had to be taken seriously because the prison\n\nwas so dangerous and there was no place where inmates were safe, counsel failed to\n\ninvestigate or challenge the state’s use of this aggravating circumstance. The petitioner\n\nfurther argues that evidence of prison conditions could have been used to mitigate the\n\ncircumstances of the crime at both the guilt and sentencing phases.\n\n\n\n               In denying relief, the post-conviction court held:\n\n\n                                               15\n\f       This ground does not serve as a basis for post-conviction relief. That the\n       prison was less safe than most other places would not have excused the\n       murder. There was some proof at trial that the prison had a dangerous\n       atmosphere, requiring vigilance on the part of the inmates. This court does\n       not disagree. But that would not have warranted striking this particular\n       aggravating circumstance. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-2-203(i)(8)(1982).\n       Thus, there is neither deficiency in performance on the part of trial counsel\n       nor prejudice in result.\n\n\n\n              We find that the post-conviction court’s findings are supported by the record.\n\nInitially, counsel for the petitioner investigated the conditions at the prison. Every inmate\n\nwho testified at the guilt and sentencing phases was asked questions regarding safety and\n\nthe meaning of a threat in prison. Moreover, defense counsel presented the testimony of\n\nCarl Crafton, a long-term inmate, who was qualified as an expert on prison life. Crafton\n\nexplained the seriousness of a death threat in prison. However, Appman was not aware\n\nthat the state of Tennessee had hired Frank Wood in 1985 to perform an evaluation of the\n\nprison system. At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner presented Wood’s testimony\n\nregarding his findings. As part of his evaluation, Wood visited nine institutions, including\n\nMCRCF.\n\n\n\n              Based on his inspection, Wood found serious deficiencies in the Tennessee\n\nDepartment of Correction (“TDOC”), especially regarding overcrowding. Wood found that\n\nthe number of inmates was beyond the design capacity of the facilities. Moreover, the\n\nclassification systems were nonfunctional. Inmates were not assigned to appropriate\n\ninstitutions, and exceptions were made constantly. As part of this problem, institutions\n\nwere being used to house inmates who were beyond the classification for which the\n\ninstitution was designed. There was also an unusually high volume of inmate movement\n\nand transfers between institutions. The violence at the prisons was systemic, with a high\n\nfrequency of assaults on staff and on other inmates. There was also an extremely high\n\nturnover among uniformed staff.\n\n\n\n              Wood noted that an unusual number of inmates in the system were\n\nrequesting voluntary protective custody. Because of the punitive segregation status and\n\nbecause an inmate could end up being in protective custody for years, Wood opined that\n\n\n                                             16\n\fit would take a high level of motivation for an inmate to commit himself to voluntary\n\nsegregation as the only option for protecting himself. Such a person might become preyed\n\nupon as a victim personality or as someone who may not be able to handle prison life\n\nwithout resorting to protective custody.\n\n\n\n              At MCRCF, Wood found overcrowding and staff shortages. The physical\n\nplant was not designed to keep the classification of inmates that were there. Units were\n\nleft unattended at different times during the day. In Wood’s opinion, MCRCF was held\n\ntogether at the time because of the commitment and hard work of the warden and staff to\n\nmaintain a rapport with the inmate population.\n\n\n\n              In reviewing the petitioner’s files from TDOC, it was Wood’s opinion that the\n\npetitioner had been inappropriately classified based on his history of violent behavior. The\n\npetitioner should have been in a situation where there was adequate staffing, supervision,\n\ncontrol, and accountability for his behavior. In Wood’s opinion, a person serving a life\n\nwithout parole sentence should not be housed in a medium security facility. While Wood\n\ndid not think that the conditions at MCRCF mitigated the petitioner’s actions, he did think\n\nthat the system had a responsibility to control inmates like the petitioner and that the state\n\nshould hold some culpability for the way the institution was managed.              The poor\n\nmanagement put other inmates in danger and also failed to provide the petitioner with the\n\nappropriate level of control.\n\n\n\n              Appman’s theory at trial was based on reasonable doubt, but that if the\n\npetitioner did commit the homicide, it was self-defense. He testified that if he had received\n\nWood’s report on prison conditions, he could have shown the jury that the tension in prison\n\nwas enormous and that the petitioner’s reaction was normal under the circumstances.\n\nMoreover, he could have shown that the violence was not directed toward the officers,\n\nwhich would have been important because of the high number of people in Morgan County\n\nwho were employed by TDOC.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f               In addition to Wood’s report, Appman did not know about Grubbs v. Bradley,\n\n552 F.Supp. 1052 (M.D. Tenn. 1982), in which the federal court addressed the issue of\n\nprison conditions, including overcrowding and violence, in TDOC. At the post-conviction\n\nhearing, the petitioner presented considerable proof on the conditions in TDOC, however,\n\nin preparing for trial, Appman had not reviewed these materials. He admitted at the\n\nhearing that this information would have assisted in the defense of the petitioner in that it\n\nwould have further explained the environment in which the homicide occurred.\n\n\n\n               While this additional information regarding prison conditions would have\n\nsupported Crafton’s testimony, it would not have provided a basis for striking the\n\naggravating circumstance. The petitioner has not shown that proof of dangerous prison\n\nconditions would warrant a ruling that the murder did not occur while the petitioner was in\n\nlawful custody, and he has failed to show that counsel’s performance was deficient or that\n\nhe was prejudiced.\n\n\n\n    (B) Failure to Prepare for and Present Evidence at the Sentencing Hearing\n\n\n\n               The petitioner contends that counsel’s failure to conduct any investigation of\n\nthe petitioner’s medical, family, social, educational, juvenile, military, institutional, or prior\n\ncriminal history, and defense counsel’s decision not to present such evidence at the\n\nsentencing hearing was not an informed decision, was facially deficient, and prejudiced the\n\npetitioner.\n\n\n\n               In death penalty cases, the sentencer may not be precluded from considering\n\nany aspect of a defendant’s character or record as a basis for a sentence less than death.\n\nLockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604-05, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 2964-65, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)\n\n(plurality opinion); see also Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 361, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 2666,\n\n125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993). The United States Supreme Court has held that mitigating\n\nevidence is relevant to sentencing hearings and should be heard. See California v. Brown,\n\n479 U.S. 538, 541, 107 S.Ct. 837, 839, 93 L.Ed.2d 934 (1987); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fU.S. 104, 113-15, 102 S.Ct. 869, 876-77, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982). “Evidence about the\n\ndefendant’s background and character is relevant because of the belief . . . that defendants\n\nwho commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background, or to\n\nemotional and mental problems may be less culpable than defendants who have no such\n\nexcuse.’” Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363, 369 (Tenn. 1996) (quoting California v. Brown,\n\n479 U.S. 538, 544, 107 S.Ct. at 841).\n\n\n\n              There is no legal requirement and no established practice that the accused\n\nmust offer evidence at the penalty phase of a capital trial. State v. Melson, 772 S.W.2d\n\n417, 421 (Tenn. 1989). In fact, in many death penalty cases, counsel has properly seen\n\nfit not to offer any evidence at the penalty phase. Id. at 421 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n              However, “[a] strategy of silence may be adopted only after a reasonable\n\ninvestigation for mitigating evidence or a reasonable decision that an investigation would\n\nbe fruitless.\" Tafero v. Wainwright, 796 F.2d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.1986). Courts have\n\nheld counsel's representation beneath professionally competent standards when\n\nsentencing counsel did not conduct enough investigation to formulate an \"accurate life\n\nprofile\" of a defendant. See Jackson v. Herring, 42 F.3d 1350, 1367 (11th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n\n              In Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363, the Supreme Court set forth the following\n\nfactors to consider in determining whether the petitioner was prejudiced by counsel’s\n\ndeficiencies: (1) the nature and extent of available mitigating proof that was not presented,\n\n(2) whether substantially similar mitigating proof was otherwise presented to the jury, and\n\n(3) whether there was strong evidence of aggravating factors so that “the mitigating\n\nevidence would not have affected the jury’s determination.” Id. at 371.\n\n\n\n              These factors were applied in Henley v. State, 960 S.W.2d 572 (Tenn. 1997),\n\ncert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 119 S.Ct. 82, 142 L.Ed.2d 64 (1998), where the defendant was\n\nconvicted of aggravated arson and two counts of premeditated murder. “At trial Henley\n\nmaintained his innocence and attempted to discredit the prosecution’s evidence.” Henley,\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\f960 S.W.2d at 574. At the penalty phase, the defense called the defendant’s mother to\n\nthe stand. In the presence of the jury, she disrupted her own testimony by announcing that\n\nshe wanted “to talk to” defense counsel. A recess was had, followed by the defense\n\nresuming its proof by calling the defendant’s grandmother, without explaining the failure\n\nof the defendant’s mother to return to the stand. The grandmother testified to various\n\nattributes of the defendant, and the defendant himself testified about a financial reversal\n\nthat caused him to lose his grandfather’s farm. Id. at 575-76. The jury sentenced the\n\ndefendant to death, based upon finding one aggravating factor in each homicide, that each\n\nmurder was “‘especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity\n\nof mind.’” Id. at 576; see T.C.A. § 39-2-203(I)(5) (repealed 1989). In his post-conviction\n\nproceeding, Henley alleged his counsel failed to investigate and prepare for the sentencing\n\nhearing, including the claims that counsel failed to investigate his mental condition and\n\nrequest an appropriate evaluation.\n\n\n\n              Henley presented two expert witnesses at the post-conviction hearing: (1) an\n\nattorney, who testified that trial counsel should have used a psychologist to assist in\n\ndetermining if mitigating proof might be feasible; and (2) a psychiatrist, who interviewed\n\nHenley and testified that, at the time of the offenses, he suffered from depression and may\n\nhave been “‘self-medicating’ by using alcohol and drugs.” Id. at 577. This latter witness\n\nalso found that Henley may have had a learning disability which may have been\n\nresponsible for his failure at farming which, in turn, caused his depression. Id.\n\n\n\n              In addressing the prejudice issue first, see Strickland, 466 U.S. 668, 697, 104\n\nS.Ct. 2052, 2069, the Supreme Court found that any failure of counsel to call as witnesses\n\nfamily members, some of whom testified at the post-conviction hearing about the positive\n\nattributes of the defendant, was not prejudicial. Utilizing the first and second prongs of the\n\nthree-prong test provided in Goad, the Court noted that the proposed evidence not only\n\nduplicated but perhaps, due to its nature, would have diminished the poignant testimony\n\nof Henley’s grandmother. Further, regarding the nature of the proposed testimony, the\n\nCourt acknowledged the principle of California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 544, 107 S.Ct. 837,\n\n\n\n                                             20\n\f841, that a disadvantaged background is often a proper source of mitigating evidence but\n\nexpressed concern about the quality of witnesses having a limited relationship with Henley\n\nor having personal knowledge about his drug use at the time of the crimes. At this\n\njuncture, the Court declared that “[a]ppellate courts must consider the quality of the\n\nproposed testimony rather than the quantity of witnesses when determining whether\n\nprejudice has been established.” Henley, 960 S.W.2d 572, 582.\n\n\n\n               As to the third prong, the Henley court observed that the proof of the\n\naggravating circumstance was strong. Id. The defendant killed an elderly couple. He shot\n\nthem several times and then burned them by setting fire to their house. The Court found\n\nample support for the single aggravating circumstance that the crime was especially\n\nheinous, atrocious, or cruel, involving torture or depravity of mind. Id.\n\n\n\n               Like in Henley, this Court has addressed the prejudice issue first, see\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. 663, 697, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2069, and we find that the petitioner has\n\nfailed to show prejudice.      Thus, there is no need to evaluate whether counsel’s\n\nperformance was deficient. Id.\n\n\n\n               At the post-conviction hearing, Appman testified that he presented all the\n\nmitigating proof available to him at the time. In preparing for the sentencing hearing, he\n\nobtained Estep’s prison file and spoke with either Estep’s mother or wife, as well as the\n\nattorney representing them in a victim compensation law suit. He also spoke with Dr. Doug\n\nYoung with the York Institute, who had previously been in charge of the educational\n\nprograms at Lake County Correctional facility. Based on his review of the petitioner’s\n\nvisitor records at the prison, Appman interviewed the Burchett family and had them testify\n\nto show that the petitioner could relate to credible people in a meaningful way. In addition,\n\nAppman presented proof that the victim had been a child molester, and Crafton had\n\ntestified at trial that the environment within the prison was different from the free world and\n\nthat when a threat was made, an inmate could not move out or call on law enforcement to\n\nprotect him.\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f             Appman obtained the petitioner’s TDOC records, but he did not attempt to\n\nget school or juvenile records or the transcript of the petitioner’s trial for killing his\n\ngrandmother. While Appman might have discussed with the petitioner his military record,\n\nhe did not attempt to obtain it. Appman filed a motion requesting the services of a\n\npsychiatrist, but the trial court denied the motion. The trial court offered to have the\n\npetitioner evaluated by the Tennessee Department of Mental Health, however, counsel\n\ndeclined this invitation. He did not seek funds for a mitigation or sentencing expert.\n\n\n\n              Under the three factors set forth in Goad, we must first look at the “nature\n\nand extent of the mitigating evidence that was available but not presented.” Goad, 938\n\nS.W.2d 363, 371. At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner presented testimony of two\n\nfriends who knew him in middle school and high school. Both would have been available\n\nand willing to testify at the sentencing hearing. He also presented the testimony of a\n\ndeputy at the Hamblen County Jail who indicated that the petitioner probably saved his life\n\nin 1978 when he was trying to break up a fight between two other inmates.\n\n\n\n             Dr. Gillian Blair, a licensed clinical psychologist, testified on behalf of the\n\npetitioner regarding the existence of factors which might have been presented as mitigating\n\nevidence at the sentencing phase. Blair concluded that the petitioner was raised in an\n\nunstable, often violent and threatening home life where the supervision and structure were\n\ninadequate. He was exposed as a child to intermittent explosive violence from his father,\n\nwho was seriously mentally ill and was hospitalized extensively at a psychiatric hospital\n\nbetween 1969 to 1976. In 1973, there was a restraining order against the father after he\n\nheld his mother and the petitioner at gun point and had a standoff with the police. In\n\ncontrast, when the petitioner’s father was not being violent, he would be overindulgent and\n\nencourage inappropriate behavior. In 1977, the petitioner’s father died of hypothermia and\n\nexposure. The death certificate indicated that alcohol abuse was a contributing factor in\n\nhis death.\n\n\n\n              From the time of his incarceration at age 18, the threatening environment that\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fthe petitioner had endured as a child was present in TDOC. The prison offered little\n\nstructure or predictability. The petitioner had to be hyper-vigilant, and this was exacerbated\n\nby the fact that a number of inmates had access to weapons and that there were a number\n\nof assaults in prison.\n\n\n\n              As a child, the petitioner suffered multiple abandonments and losses.\n\nSpecifically, his mother abandoned him before the age of one, he essentially lost his father\n\nto mental illness, and ultimately he suffered the death of his father. Moreover, the\n\ncircumstances of his father’s death were never explained to him. The petitioner also\n\nsuffered the loss of his grandfather at the age of 7 or 8, and the separation from his\n\nmaternal grandparents at the age of 2. He was essentially raised by his paternal\n\ngrandmother, who was a school teacher.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner has an extensive drug history. By the time he was an\n\nadolescent, he was using a wide variety of drugs. The petitioner admitted the he had dealt\n\ndrugs extensively as well, to provide a means of obtaining his own drugs and to provide\n\nhimself some money. His lack of internal controls was exacerbated by his drug use.\n\n\n\n              Eventually, the petitioner’s juvenile problems and drug abuse led to him being\n\nsent to Knoxville to live with his aunt and attend high school. While he failed some\n\nclasses, he did not fail a grade. He eventually dropped out of high school during the\n\neleventh grade. In 1978, the petitioner received his GED at a community college. At age\n\n17, the petitioner joined the Navy from November to December of 1978. He received an\n\nhonorable discharge, however, the records indicate that he was unable to adjust to military\n\nlife. The petitioner was described as being overwhelmed by the training and unable to\n\nadjust to the emotional pressure. According to the records, the petitioner’s attitude toward\n\nauthority was respectful. Thereafter, the petitioner was incarcerated at the age of 18 and\n\nhas been incarcerated continually since that time.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s medical records were limited. He was shot in the eye at the\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fage of 9. He had several head injuries which lead to a loss of consciousness. One such\n\nincident involved a motorcycle accident when the petitioner was 12. The petitioner also\n\nsuffered sporting accidents at age 13 and 15. In addition, the petitioner was shot in the\n\nknee at the age of 16. There is no record of the petitioner having any psychiatric history\n\nor treatment before entering TDOC.\n\n\n\n                According to Blair, the TDOC records indicated that if kept in a safe and\n\nstructured environment, the petitioner is well-adjusted, presents no management problems,\n\nand is not violent. Blair admitted that at the time of the trial, her profession felt that it was\n\ndifficult to predict future dangerousness and that the key indicator was a past history of\n\nviolence. She further admitted that this factor would not have weighed in favor of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n\n\n                Blair concluded that the cumulative data, social history, interview, and test\n\nresults supported personality traits that would have rendered the petitioner vulnerable to\n\nprevailing conditions in TDOC during the early 1980s. Those conditions included an\n\nunstable, violent, and threatening environment, where supervision and structure were\n\ninadequate to the number of inmates. She did not find any sign of cognitive impairment\n\nor organic process. Nor did Blair find any suggestion of thought disorder or any type of\n\npsychosis.\n\n\n\n                Blair’s primary diagnosis was that the petitioner has an Axis II personality\n\ndisorder.     Tension consistent with an underlying anxiety disorder was also evident.\n\nAccording to Blair, individuals with these profiles tend to be blunt, self-critical, and have\n\ninadequate defense mechanisms. The observed clinical profile was consistent with a\n\npattern of chronic maladjustment. These individuals tend to be suspicious, alienated, self-\n\nindulgent, and narcissistic, with immature, manipulative, and somewhat aggressive\n\nbehaviors. Blair agreed with a previous diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder.\n\n\n\n                In rebuttal, the state presented the testimony of Dr. Theodore H. Blau, a\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fclinical psychologist from Tampa, Florida. Rather than conduct his own mental tests or\n\nevaluations on the petitioner, Blau based his opinion on the psychological evaluation\n\nperformed by Blair, which he described as excellent. Although he admitted that it was\n\ndifficult to evaluate someone’s mental status from 11 years earlier, Blau made four basic\n\nconclusions based on his review and evaluation of the petitioner. First, Blau found no\n\nindications that the petitioner, in January 1985, suffered a mental disease or defect which\n\nwould cause him to lack an understanding of the wrongfulness of his act or to prevent him\n\nfrom conforming to the requirements of the law. Second, Blau found no indications that\n\nthe petitioner, in January 1985, suffered a mental disease or defect which substantially\n\naffected his intellect or judgment.     Third, Blau found no indications that the prison\n\nconditions in January 1985 caused or exacerbated a mental disease or defect in the\n\npetitioner. Finally, Blau found nothing in the record or in the research reviewed to suggest\n\nthat prison conditions gave the petitioner no alternative other than to protect himself with\n\na “preemptive strike” by murdering the victim.\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner testified on his own behalf at the hearing. He wanted\n\nto testify at the trial and at the sentencing hearing, however, Appman convinced him that\n\ntestifying would not be in his best interest based on his past convictions. In addition to the\n\ninformation given by Blair about his personal history, the petitioner testified at the hearing\n\nthat he loved his father, although his father’s mental illness made him unreliable at times.\n\nHis father would sometimes make the petitioner believe that his birth was a factor in his\n\nparents’ divorce. In attempting to get his father’s attention, the petitioner tried to excel in\n\nsports, however, his father did not attend many sporting events. When his father would\n\nreturn home from the psychiatric hospital, the petitioner would see an improvement.\n\nHowever, soon the pattern of behavior would repeat itself, and his father would return to\n\nthe hospital. Because of his father’s inconsistent presence in his life, the petitioner felt\n\ninsecure.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s paternal grandmother was the only stable individual in his life.\n\nHe knew that his grandmother would provide for him. When he was young, the petitioner\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\ffelt like a burden to his grandmother. She did not display emotion or physical affection,\n\nand he felt unloved. As a teenager, the petitioner had no supervision.\n\n\n\n              At the age of 15, the petitioner was deeply impacted by the death of his\n\nfather. All hope that his father would become well and share a normal relationship with him\n\nwas taken away. His grandmother gave him a car at the age of 16, and this increased his\n\naccess to drugs and to people with similar interests. The petitioner turned heavily to drugs\n\nand alcohol to deal with the hurt over his father’s death, and he lost interest in school and\n\nsports. His drug use became heavier, and he started selling drugs. Drug dealing\n\ndominated his life and pulled him away from his old friends. By the time he was 18, the\n\npetitioner had a cocaine habit. In the Fall of 1979, the petitioner moved back to Morristown\n\nto live with his grandmother. He admitted that during this time, he was doing more drugs\n\nthan any other time in his life.\n\n\n\n              At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner admitted that he killed his\n\ngrandmother and that he had lied about it at the trial. At the time, lying made it easier to\n\naccept his grandmother’s death and his involvement. Moreover, he had not wanted to\n\naccept punishment.      When interviewed by Blair, the petitioner lied about killing his\n\ngrandmother.\n\n\n\n              As to the circumstances of Estep’s murder, the petitioner testified that he and\n\nFreeman bought a $50 bag of marijuana from Estep. The marijuana was low quality, so\n\nthe petitioner took it back and demanded his money. Estep, who was insulting, would not\n\nreturn the money. At a later time, Freeman and the petitioner went to Estep’s room to\n\ndemand the money. The petitioner threw the marijuana on Estep’s bed and asked for the\n\nmoney. There was a fight, and the petitioner took Estep’s watch, saying that he would get\n\nit back when he gave them the $50. Later that day, the petitioner received word that Estep\n\nwas intending to kill him and was making open threats. While the petitioner sent Estep\n\nseveral messages saying that he wanted to drop the matter, it was to no avail. In order to\n\nprotect himself, the petitioner obtained a knife. In the dining hall, the petitioner saw that\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fEstep had a knife in his hands under his dinner tray. The petitioner stood up and Estep\n\nwalked to the opposite side of the room. This incident lead the petitioner to believe that\n\nEstep was serious about killing him, however, he did not check himself into protective\n\ncustody because he would have lost his privileges and it would have given him a reputation\n\nas someone who could not handle his own problems.\n\n\n\n              On the day of the murder, the petitioner and Freeman entered Guild 5 as\n\nsoon as the officer left. The petitioner testified that Street was not involved. Only two or\n\nthree inmates were sitting at a table in the back of the guild. The petitioner went into\n\nEstep’s room, and Freeman kept watch outside the cell. The petitioner had placed a\n\nmagazine underneath his shirt with an ace bandage wrapped around it as body armor, and\n\nhis knife was in his waistband. The petitioner made one last attempt at making peace, but\n\nEstep threw coffee in his face. After that, there was a struggle. When the petitioner was\n\nable to free himself, he got out the knife and began stabbing Estep. Eventually, the\n\npetitioner called Freeman for help. Freeman came into the cell and helped the petitioner\n\nstab Estep. When Estep finally quit struggling, the petitioner washed the knives in the toilet\n\nand put them under the bed. He then washed his face, and the two left. The petitioner\n\nwent to his room, took off his clothes, and placed them in a garbage bag, which he placed\n\nnear the front door for pick up. He then took a shower to wash off the blood. The\n\npetitioner claimed that he killed Estep in self defense.\n\n\n\n              In reviewing the “quality of the proposed testimony,” see Henley, 960 S.W.2d\n\n572, 582, it would have been proper proof at a sentencing hearing. As in Henley, however,\n\nthe evidence does not reveal a “disadvantaged background,” nor does it suggest\n\n“emotional and mental problems [that make the defendant] less culpable than defendants\n\nwho have no such excuse.” See Brown, 479 U.S. at 544, 107 S. Ct. at 841. As noted\n\nabove, the asserted mitigating factor in Goad was a recognized mental illness, whereas\n\nin the present case, the clinical psychologist diagnosed the petitioner with a personality\n\ndisorder. See State v. Alvin Robinson, Jr., No. 02C01-9608-CR-00280, slip op. at 9 (Tenn.\n\nCrim. App., filed at Jackson, Dec. 3, 1997) (For purposes of defeating premeditation and\n\n\n\n                                             27\n\freducing first-degree murder to a lesser grade, “[t]estimony that a defendant suffers from\n\na personality disorder, rather than a mental disease or defect, fails to establish diminished\n\ncapacity.”), remanded on other grounds, (Tenn. Nov. 9, 1998); see also Strickland, 466\n\nU.S. 668, 700, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2071 (“considerable emotional stress that did not rise to the\n\nlevel of extreme disturbance” not sufficient in the face of strong aggravating factors to\n\ndemonstrate a probability that the use of the evidence would have changed the outcome).\n\n\n\n              Indeed, the proof at the post-conviction hearing showed little positive or\n\nredeeming evidence, with the exception of the deputy with the Hamblen County Sheriff’s\n\nDepartment who testified that the petitioner had probably saved his life. See Groseclose\n\nv. Bell, 130 F.3d 1161, 1170-71 (6th Cir. 1997)(At capital sentencing hearing, counsel\n\nfailed to use proof that defendant had no criminal record, was active in church, had a\n\npositive record of military service, and had plethora of family members willing to testify on\n\nhis behalf), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S.Ct. 1826, 140 L.Ed.2d 962 (1998).\n\n\n\n              Moreover, some of the proposed testimony would have been damaging to\n\nthe defense. Specifically, by delving into the petitioner’s background, defense counsel\n\nwould have necessarily had to consider the daunting prospect that such proposed\n\nevidence would have invited cross-examination or rebuttal to show the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the two murders committed in North Carolina and the murder of his\n\ngrandmother. The petitioner’s grandmother, who was a school teacher, had adopted and\n\nraised the petitioner, provided for his material needs, and protected him from his father’s\n\npsychotic outbursts of violence. It was when the grandmother discovered the prior murders\n\nthat the petitioner beat her to death. See Rickman v. Bell, 131 F.3d 1150, 1157 (6th Cir.\n\n1997) (finding deficient counsel’s performance where he “succeeded in creating a\n\nloathsome image for Rickman -- one that would make a juror feel compelled to rid the world\n\nof him”).\n\n\n\n              As to the second factor offered in Goad, whether evidence similar to the\n\nproposed evidence had already been heard by the jury, Appman presented proof of the\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fprison conditions throughout the trial and the sentencing hearing. Also, proof of the\n\npetitioner having a relationship with normal, law-abiding citizens was shown through the\n\ntestimony of the Burchetts. However, no proof regarding the petitioner’s personal and\n\nfamily background or history was presented at the sentencing hearing.                Again, as\n\npreviously stated, such proof would have potentially opened the door to quite damaging\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n              The third Goad factor, the competing strength of the aggravating factors,\n\nfurther illustrates that any deficient performance was not prejudicial. See Henley, 960\n\nS.W.2d 572, 582. Here, the jury found three aggravating circumstances which were\n\nsupported by the proof. Specifically, the jury found that the petitioner had a prior conviction\n\nfor a felony involving violence, T.C.A. § 39-2-203(I)(2) (repealed 1989), which is an\n\naggravating circumstance that is “more qualitatively persuasive and objectively reliable than\n\nothers.” State v. Howell, 868 S.W.2d 238, 261 (Tenn. 1993). In the present case, the\n\nstate chose to only present proof of one of the petitioner’s three prior murder convictions\n\nto support this aggravating circumstance.           Moreover, the other two aggravating\n\ncircumstances, the murder was committed while the petitioner was in lawful custody and\n\nthe murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, T.C.A. § 39-2-203(i)(5) and (8) (repealed\n\n1989), are supported by the proof. See State v. Sutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 767.\n\n\n\n              Based on the application of the factors set forth in Goad, the Court finds that\n\nthe petitioner has failed to demonstrate prejudicial ineffectiveness of counsel in preparing\n\nfor and conducting further mitigation defense at the sentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n              © Failure to Support Motion for Psychological Evaluation\n\n\n\n              The petitioner argues that counsel’s failure to support his motion for a\n\npsychological evaluation, to pursue the psychological evaluation, or to present evidence\n\nat sentencing relating to an evaluation were all facially deficient actions that prejudiced him.\n\n\n\n\n                                              29\n\f              Again, we find that the post-conviction court properly denied relief on this\n\nissue. As pointed out by the post-conviction court, the proof showed that the petitioner\n\nrefused to assert “mental disease or defect or any diminished capacity as either a defense\n\nor in mitigation of the crime or the punishment.” The petitioner testified at the post-\n\nconviction hearing that he told Appman he did not want to pursue a mental defense.\n\nMoreover, the testimony of both clinical psychologists confirmed that the petitioner was not\n\nsuffering from a mental disease or defect at the time of the offense or the trial. Further, as\n\npointed out by the post-conviction court, if a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist had\n\ntestified, there would have been a distinct probability that the expert would have been\n\ncross-examined about the details of the petitioner’s prior episodes of violence, consisting\n\nof at least three prior homicides, including the murder of his grandmother. Counsel was\n\ngiven the opportunity to have his client evaluated by the state facility, however, he declined\n\nthis invitation because of fear that the state would use the unfavorable information\n\nregarding the petitioner’s past. Based on these facts, we cannot find that the petitioner\n\nwas prejudiced by counsel’s failure to pursue a psychological evaluation. Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2067.\n\n\n\n           (D) Opening and Closing Argument at the Sentencing Hearing\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that counsel’s failure to prepare or present an\n\nopening argument at sentencing, or to prepare and present a coherent closing argument\n\nat sentencing on why the petitioner should not be sentenced to death was prejudicial. The\n\npetitioner contends that if counsel had done the necessary investigation, preparation, and\n\npresentation of a coherent mitigation case, he would have been able to present an opening\n\nargument and a coherent closing argument. Initially, this Court notes that a review of the\n\nrecord reveals that defense counsel did in fact present an opening statement at the\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n              Regarding counsel’s opening argument at the sentencing hearing, the post-\n\nconviction court held:\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       The petitioner suggests that the opening statement, consisting of only two\n       pages, was insufficient and he speculates that a more adequate statement\n       may have produced a different result. There is simply inadequate proof of\n       that proposition. By this time, the jury had heard a great deal of evidence\n       about the crime. The defense theory was evident. The petitioner’s social\n       history and criminal record, in only 18 years outside of incarceration, was\n       atrocious. There were some very favorable character witnesses for the\n       petitioner. It was a reasonable tactic to limit the damaging effect of the\n       unfavorable circumstances. Much of the favorable evidence today, as shown\n       in the evidentiary hearing, shows the petitioner has matured since the time\n       of trial.\n\n\n\n              As to the quality of the closing argument at sentencing, the post-conviction\n\ncourt held:\n\n\n\n       The petitioner makes this claim with the view that his trial counsel could have\n       made a more cogent, compelling argument had he conducted more legal\n       and factual research. The evidentiary hearing did not, however, produce\n       evidence that supports that claim. There is no indication that the result\n       would have been different. Simply too much emphasis has been placed\n       upon trial counsel’s role in the sentencing hearing. The problem for the\n       petitioner in this stage of the trial was his prior criminal record which included\n       three prior murder convictions in addition to that of Carl Estep, and\n       confessions for two other, unresolved claims of murder. Even with additional\n       expert and mitigating witnesses, the petitioner has failed to show what could\n       have been said by his counsel to the jury that might have caused a different\n       sentence.\n\n\n\n              The Court finds that the evidence does not preponderate against the post-\n\nconviction court’s findings on this claim. See Butler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899.\n\n\n\n                               (E) Absence of Co-Counsel\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that counsel was ineffective by failing to request the\n\nappointment of co-counsel. He points to the extraordinary burdens imposed on counsel\n\nduring the pre-trial discovery process and the fact that counsel virtually conducted no\n\nfactual or legal investigation of possible mitigation.\n\n\n\n              At the post-conviction hearing, Appman stated that although the trial court\n\noffered to appoint co-counsel, he deliberately refused the offer. A paralegal with his office\n\ndid extensive investigation on this case. Appman also testified that he worked with the\n\n                                              31\n\fattorneys representing the co-defendants. In denying relief on this claim, the post-\n\nconviction court held:\n\n\n\n       The petitioner had experienced trial counsel who demonstrated a dogged\n       work ethic in the preparations for this trial. That each of the codefendants\n       had two lawyers, all of whom cooperated with the petitioner’s counsel, is\n       further evidence that the petitioner was not prejudiced in any way. All\n       testimony suggested the efforts of trial counsel for the petitioner commanded\n       the respect of his colleagues, who looked upon him for guidance and\n       leadership.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner has failed to show that counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\nrequest co-counsel or that he was prejudiced by that decision. At the time of the trial,\n\nAppman had practiced law for several years, trying his first major murder case more than\n\n10 years prior to the petitioner’s trial. Appman had also tried several cases in Morgan\n\nCounty and was familiar with the area. In addition, Appman was assisted by his paralegal,\n\nand he worked with the attorneys representing the co-defendants. Judge Eblen, who\n\npresided over the trial, testified that Appman did not seem hindered by the lack of co-\n\ncounsel, nor did his defense strategy appear disjointed during the course of the trial.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court’s\n\nfinding on this issue. See Butler v. State, 789 S.W.2d 898, 899.\n\n\n\n                         (F) Failure to Object to Jury Instructions\n\n\n\n               The petitioner contends that counsel’s failure to research, object to, file a new\n\ntrial motion on, or raise on appeal, a number of improper instructions constituted facially\n\ndeficient performance that was prejudicial.\n\n\n\n               First, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research and to\n\nobject at trial, post-trial, and on appeal to the court’s preliminary instruction to the effect\n\nthat “The law with regard to First Degree murder in the State of Tennessee says that those\n\npersons convicted of that offense shall receive the death penalty or, if the jury decides that\n\nit is appropriate, then the jury will fix a life sentence.”\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\f               Initially, the Court notes that no such instruction is found at the citation to the\n\nrecord included in the petitioner’s brief. See Rule 10(b), Tennessee Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals Rules. Regardless, the argument that these jury instructions shift the burden of\n\nproof to the defendant to show that a life sentence should be imposed has been rejected\n\nby our Supreme Court. See State v. Van Tran, 864 S.W.2d 465, 478 (Tenn. 1993); State\n\nv. Bane, 853 S.W.2d 483, 488 (Tenn. 1993). Accordingly, counsel cannot be held deficient\n\nfor failing to raise the issue.\n\n\n\n               Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research and to\n\nobject at trial, post-trial, and on appeal to the repeated references in the charge at\n\nsentencing and the sentencing verdict form to the requirements of unanimity.\n\n\n\n               Again, arguments regarding these jury instructions have been repeatedly\n\nrejected by our Supreme Court. See State v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 87; State v. Smith,\n\n857 S.W.2d 1, 22-23 (Tenn. 1993); State v. Barber, 753 S.W.2d 659, 670-71 (Tenn. 1988).\n\nThus, counsel was not ineffective by failing to object.\n\n\n\n               Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research and to\n\nobject at sentencing, post-trial, and on appeal to allowing the aggravating circumstance\n\nthat the petitioner was in custody at the time of the offense to go to the jury when the trial\n\ncourt did not charge the jury on this aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n\n               A review of the record reflects that the trial court instructed the jury to\n\nconsider whether “the murder was committed by the Defendants while they were in lawful\n\ncustody or in a place of lawful confinement or during their escape from lawful custody or\n\nfrom a place of lawful confinement.” Accordingly, the jury was properly instructed, and\n\ncounsel had no reason to object to an uninstructed jury.\n\n\n\n               Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel was deficient because he\n\nfailed to research and to object pre-trial, post-trial, and on appeal to the ambiguity of the\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fjury instruction on the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n\n               On this issue, despite our Supreme Court’s conclusions to the contrary, the\n\npost-conviction court acknowledged that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that\n\nthe “especially heinous” instruction as well as the term “depravity of mind” does not meet\n\nconstitutional safeguards. See Houston v. Dutton, 50 F.3d 381 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 516\n\nU.S. 905, 116 S.Ct. 272, 133 L.Ed.2d 193 (1995). However, the post-conviction court went\n\non to perform a harmless error analysis pursuant to State v. Howell, 868 S.W.2d 238, and\n\nconcluded that application of the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance was\n\nharmless beyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\n               In State v. Williams, 690 S.W.2d 517 (Tenn. 1985), our Supreme Court\n\nreversed a sentence of death and remanded for a new sentencing hearing after finding\n\n\"that the court did not instruct the jury concerning the legal significance of the words\n\n'heinous,' 'atrocious,' 'cruel,' 'torture,' or 'depravity of mind' as those terms are used in the\n\naggravating circumstance defined in T.C.A. § 39-2-203(i)(5).\" Id. at 532. The Court found\n\nthe statute to be constitutional \"so long as the abstract terms employed therein are\n\nconstrued and interpreted as we have done in this opinion and other opinions of this\n\nCourt.\" Id. at 533. Jury instructions on the definitions are necessary to preclude \"a\n\nbasically uninstructed jury\" that \"cannot lawfully impose the death penalty,\" Id. (citing\n\nGodfrey v. Georgia, 446 U.S. 420, 429, 100 S.Ct. 1759, 1765, 64 L.Ed.2d 398 (1980)). A\n\nreview of the jury instructions given at the petitioner’s trial reflects that the jury was properly\n\ninstructed on the necessary definitions.\n\n\n\n               Whereas, in Houston, the trial court did not instruct the jury on the definitions\n\nof any of the terms set forth in the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance.\n\n50 F.3d 381, 387. In Rickman v. Dutton, 854 F. Supp. 1305, 1309-10 (M.D. Tenn. 1994),\n\nthe trial court defined the terms \"heinous,\" \"atrocious,\" and \"cruel\" for the jury but did not\n\ndefine the terms \"torture\" or \"depravity of mind.\" 854 F.Supp. 1305, 1309-10. In reviewing\n\nthe instruction, the district court held that the \"especially heinous\" instruction, even as\n\n\n\n                                                34\n\flimited by the definition of heinous as \"extremely wicked or shockingly evil,\" was\n\nunconstitutionally vague. Id. at 1310. The district court also held that the instruction was\n\nvague despite the inclusion of the term \"depravity of mind,\" which it also found to be\n\nunconstitutionally vague. Id. In contrast, the trial court in the present case instructed the\n\njury on all the definitions required under Williams, and counsel’s performance was not\n\ndeficient in failing to raise this issue.\n\n\n\n               Finally, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research and\n\ninvestigate, and to prepare proposed instructions at the guilt and sentencing phases based\n\non the federal findings and admitted conclusions of the state’s own experts on factual\n\nissues bearing directly on the petitioner’s assertion of self-defense, on statutory mitigating\n\ncircumstances, and on non-statutory mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n\n               As noted by the post-conviction court, a more extensive case could have\n\nbeen presented, however, this is not the standard in reviewing a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. Previously in this opinion, the Court found that the petitioner had\n\nnot met his burden of proving ineffective assistance based on counsel’s failure to present\n\nproof of prior federal proceedings on the issue of prison conditions. The same holds true\n\nfor counsel’s failure to request these jury instructions. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                   (G) Failure to Object to Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n\n\n               The petitioner raises several claims that counsel was ineffective by failing to\n\nobject to misconduct by the prosecution. The post-conviction court held that the petitioner\n\nfailed to show any misconduct, and therefore, his claim of ineffective assistance was held\n\nto be without merit. While in some instances, the arguments made by the prosecution\n\nwere improper, we find that the petitioner has failed to show that he was prejudiced by\n\ncounsel’s failure to object to these remarks.\n\n\n\n               First, the petitioner submits that defense counsel failed to investigate or\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fresearch, or to object at trial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s repeated\n\nmisstatements in voir dire that the conditions at MCRCF had no bearing on how the law\n\nshould be applied. While the petitioner cites to the record for the specific instances\n\ncomplained of, he has failed to cite to any authority supporting relief on this issue, and\n\ntherefore, the issue is deemed waived. See Rule 10, Tennessee Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals Rules.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research or to\n\nobject at trial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s statements about Crafton’s\n\ncredibility, not only because such practice was improper generally, but because the\n\nprosecution’s argument was misleading to the extent that it implied that inmate Crafton’s\n\ntestimony about the dangerous conditions in TDOC was untrue. Specifically, the petitioner\n\ncomplains of two comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument at the guilt\n\nphase: “[Crafton] thinks he is a cut above the other prisoners, that he is a man of\n\ncharacter, a man of principle a man who wants to live decently and rightly” and “[a]re you\n\ngoing to buy the goods he is trying to sell to you?”\n\n\n\n              A prosecutor's argument must be supported by evidence introduced at trial\n\nand the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence. State v. Beasley, 536\n\nS.W.2d 328, 330 (Tenn.1976). Moreover, a lawyer's personal opinion as to the credibility\n\nof witnesses should not be injected into the closing argument. Id. While a prosecutor is\n\nan advocate, entitled to pursue his role with thoroughness and vigor, he must also act as\n\nthe representative of a sovereignty who has an obligation to govern impartially. Judge v.\n\nState, 539 S.W.2d 340, 344 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1976). Therefore, \"improper suggestions,\n\ninsinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much\n\nweight against the accused when they should properly carry none.\" Berger v. United\n\nStates, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed.2d 1314 (1935).\n\n\n\n              In order to determine whether any improper conduct was prejudicial, this\n\nCourt has set forth five factors to consider:\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\f       (1) the conduct complained of viewed in the context and in light of the facts\n       and circumstances of the case, (2) any curative measures undertaken by the\n       court and the prosecution, (3) the intent of the prosecutor in making the\n       improper statement, (4) the cumulative effect of the improper conduct and\n       any other errors in the record, and (5) the relative strength or weakness of\n       the case.\n\n\n\nJudge v. State, 539 S.W.2d 340, 344.\n\n\n\n              In the present case, the prosecuting attorney's remarks about Crafton were\n\nsupported by the record. Crafton testified during cross-examination that he had never met\n\nanother inmate with his principles or character. As to the prosecutor’s question to the jury\n\nwhether it was going to “buy the goods he is trying to sell you,” the state also made clear\n\nthat it was the jury’s responsibility to judge the credibility of witnesses:\n\n\n\n              [Crafton] was here to give his viewpoints and his expert opinion on\n       prison life. The first thing I would like you to consider is was he credible to\n       you? Listen carefully when the Judge charges as to how to determine\n       someone’s credibility and the things that you are entitled to consider, such\n       as respectability, possible bias, whether they really know what they are\n       talking about in the first place.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the jury was charged by the trial court regarding the weight and credibility as\n\nto all witnesses. Even if the closing remarks of the prosecutor were improper, which we\n\ndo not find, we find that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate resulting prejudice.\n\n\n\n              In a similar complaint, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to\n\nobject at trial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s argument “Are you willing for the\n\ncitizens of Morgan County to accept the kind of prison system that [Crafton] seems to think\n\nyou ought to have,” implying that the petitioner and Crafton were responsible for the\n\nsystem-wide violence. While the prosecutor’s argument was not supported by the proof,\n\nin that Crafton testified as to his impressions of actual prison conditions and not what\n\nprison conditions should be, the petitioner has failed to show that this argument was\n\nprejudicial. See Judge v. State, 539 S.W.2d 340, 344.\n\n\n\n\n                                              37\n\f              Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to object at trial,\n\npost-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s argument that the defendants must be guilty\n\nbecause they were the persons whom Worthington immediately placed in administrative\n\nsegregation. Specifically, the prosecutor argued to the jury:\n\n\n\n              Now, use your common sense here for a moment. Who was locked\n       up immediately after this body was found and the very first information\n       received? They are sitting right over there. Do you think Mr. Worthington\n       said, “Oh, let’s see, we got a dead man here, lock up Street, Sutton and\n       Freeman.” Do any of you all believe that?\n\n\n\n              This argument was clearly inappropriate. A prosecutor should not imply that\n\na defendant is guilty because he is the one who was arrested. See State v. Hicks, 618\n\nS.W.2d 510, 516 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1981) (Improper for prosecutor to argue that because\n\ngrand jury charged defendant, he must be presumed guilty). See also, United States v.\n\nBess, 593 F.2d 749, 753-54 (6th Cir. 1979) (Improper for prosecutor to suggest that\n\ndefendant is guilty because he is being prosecuted or has been indicted). However, after\n\nreviewing this comment in light of the record, we do not find that it affected the verdict.\n\nSee Judge v. State, 539 S.W .2d 340, 344. Therefore, the petitioner has not shown\n\nprejudice due to counsel’s failure to object.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to object at trial,\n\npost-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s argument that “I have not heard one word of\n\nNick Sutton or Thomas Street ever being touched by Carl Estep. I heard a lot of\n\nsuggestion, but that is all it has been.” The petitioner contends that this argument\n\nconstituted an impermissible comment on his failure to testify. We disagree. The\n\nargument did not comment on the petitioner’s failure to testify. It was merely a comment\n\non the proof. There was testimony regarding possible threats made by the victim, but there\n\nwas no proof of the victim physically attacking or hurting the petitioner. This argument\n\ndoes not constitute misconduct, State v. Beasley, 536 S.W.2d 328, 330, and therefore,\n\ncounsel was not ineffective by failing to object.\n\n\n\n\n                                            38\n\f              Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel should have objected at\n\ntrial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s arguments regarding future\n\ndangerousness. Specifically, the petitioner argues that an objection should have been\n\nmade to the following arguments made by the prosecution: “What are you going to do to\n\nNicholas Sutton, Give him a life sentence? Will that prevent there being another Carl\n\nEstep?,” “Society has certain rights and the State simply asks that you exercise society’s\n\nright to self-defense. These men are already locked up. Mr. Nicholas Sutton is already\n\nserving a life sentence,” “[Sutton] was conditioned on the street to kill people. Ladies and\n\ngentlemen, we suggest to you that persons who are armed robbers and first degree\n\nmurderers are already conditioned to kill people,” and “When we get to the point that we\n\nhave done everything possible to protect ourselves and there is nothing else we can\n\nreasonably do that would protect ourselves from people like Nicholas Todd Sutton...then\n\nwe have the right of self-defense and this is where capital punishment comes in.”\n\n\n\n              A capital sentencing jury is not precluded from consideration of the future\n\ndangerousness of a particular defendant where such is a relevant factor under a state's\n\ncapital sentencing law. See Jurek v. Texas, 428 U.S. 262, 96 S.Ct. 2950, 49 L.Ed.2d 929\n\n(1976). Generally, however, our Courts have held that the issue of specific or general\n\ndeterrence should be avoided by the prosecution in closing argument at a capital\n\nsentencing hearing. See State v. Bates, 804 S.W.2d 868, 881-82 (Tenn. 1991); State v.\n\nIrick, 762 S.W.2d 121, 131 (Tenn.1988). Specifically, the deterrence argument is usually\n\nirrelevant to the aggravating circumstances listed in Tennessee's statute. State v. Bates,\n\n804 S.W.2d at 882. Thus, \"unless relevant to some theory raised by the State[']s proof,\n\nor the defense, it interjects an element into the jury's considerations not provided for by the\n\nlaw.\" Id. In reviewing the propriety of argument in a capital sentencing proceeding, the\n\nreviewing court must determine whether the prosecutor's comments affected the\n\nsentencing decision. State v. Irick, 762 S.W.2d 121, 131. \"If the Court cannot say the\n\ncomments had no effect on the sentencing, then the jury's decision does not meet the\n\nstandard of reliability required by the Eighth Amendment.\" Id. (citing Caldwell v. Mississippi,\n\n472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 2646, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985)).\n\n\n\n                                              39\n\f              While these comments by the prosecution were obviously inappropriate,\n\nbased on a review of the entire record, we do not find that the jury’s decision was affected.\n\nAccordingly, the petitioner has failed to show prejudice based on counsel’s failure to object.\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to move to strike\n\nor to dismiss the death notice because given the state’s longstanding indifference to\n\nviolence in TDOC and its causes, given the 1985 findings of Mr. Wood, and given the\n\nundisputed fact that the victim had repeatedly threatened the petitioner and refused offers\n\nof peace, the petitioner submits that a death notice in this case violated the due process\n\nand the cruel and unusual punishment guarantees of the United States and Tennessee\n\nconstitutions. The underlying issue regarding prison conditions has been addressed in this\n\nopinion, and we do not find that counsel was ineffective for failing to move to strike or to\n\ndismiss the death notice.\n\n\n\n                     (H) Failure to Raise Issues on Direct Appeal\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that defense counsel was ineffective on appeal\n\nbecause he failed to research the law, investigate the facts, perfect the record, and raise\n\nimportant issues on appeal. He points to each of the issues raised in his brief and in the\n\namended post-conviction petition, and as to each fact and legal argument raised. Because\n\nwe have held that the petitioner’s claims are without merit, we find that his claim of\n\nineffective assistance based on counsel’s failure to raise these issues on direct appeal is\n\nwithout merit.\n\n\n\n                                   (I) Cumulative Effect\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner contends that the cumulative effect of counsel’s\n\nrepeated, deficient failures rendered his trial and sentencing fundamentally unfair. Based\n\non our review of the issues raised regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we reject the\n\npetitioner’s contention that the cumulative effect of any errors found would require reversal.\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\f                    V. False Testimony and Misleading Argument\n                          Regarding Conditions at MCRCF\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that during the trial, the state falsely portrayed inmate\n\nsafety and security at MCRCF. On this issue, the post-conviction court held:\n\n\n\n       The petitioner has failed to meet his burden of proof. There is insufficient\n       evidence to establish that the state misrepresented the level of safety and\n       security for inmates at the Morgan County Regional Correctional Facility at\n       the time of the offense. There is no indication that the witness, James\n       Worthington, inappropriately misled the petitioner or his counsel in this\n       regard. Moreover, the petitioner was in a position to have known of these\n       circumstances, divulge them to his counsel, and supply possible witnesses\n       in support of his claims. For example, the petitioner presented a witness at\n       trial, Carl Crafton, who testified at length about prison life and the conditions\n       that existed in the Department of Corrections at the time of this offense.\n\n\n\n              At trial, Worthington testified regarding his perceptions of the prison\n\nenvironment at MCRCF. Proof that Worthington was aware of Wood’s report does not\n\nmake his testimony regarding his own perceptions of the prison conditions false. Cf.\n\nBrotherton v. State, 477 S.W.2d 522, 523-24 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1971)(doctor’s opinion\n\ntestimony regarding whether defendant appeared sober is not made out to be perjury by\n\nresults of blood test reflecting alcohol content of .014 in defendant's blood).\n\n\n\n        VI. False Testimony Regarding Prior Statement of Inmate Lumbert\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that a handwritten memo regarding inmate Gary\n\nLumbert’s statement taken by Worthington was not included in the state’s files and was\n\nonly produced a few days prior to the post-conviction hearing. The petitioner submits that\n\nthe statement was manufactured, that it constituted false testimony, and that the testimony\n\nwas material to the proceedings. The petitioner further contends that the post-conviction\n\ncourt erred by failing to address this issue.\n\n\n\n              While it does not appear that the post-conviction court addressed this specific\n\nissue, we find that it is without merit. Worthington’s notebook contained notes from all the\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\finterviews conducted during the investigation of the murder, however, a memo regarding\n\nan interview of Lumbert on March 13, 1985, was not included in the notebook, nor was\n\nLumbert’s name included on the lists provided to defense counsel. Lumbert eventually\n\ntestified at trial on behalf of co-defendant Street. Before the post-conviction hearing, the\n\nmemo regarding the interview with Lumbert was found in Worthington’s miscellaneous file.\n\nWorthington testified that the statement was not in his notebook because it had been\n\nmisplaced.\n\n\n\n              Included in the state’s file were notes written by General Harvey during\n\nLumbert’s testimony at trial. According to General Harvey, Worthington was telling the\n\nprosecutors that Lumbert had given different answers during his interview that were\n\ncontrary to his testimony. General Harvey took notes so they could look into the matter.\n\nThe notes indicated that Lumbert had told W orthington that Freeman and Street were\n\nbragging about the murder, however, the memo regarding an interview of Lumbert\n\nindicated that Lumbert had stated that the petitioner and Street were the ones bragging\n\nabout the murder. General Harvey did not know if he had misinterpreted what Worthington\n\nwas saying or if Worthington had misspoken at the time.\n\n\n\n              A review of the trial transcript also refutes the petitioner’s claim. When\n\nWorthington was cross-examined by defense counsel, he indicated that inmate Lumbert’s\n\nstatement had been recorded and the trial court ordered the state to produce that\n\nstatement for the purposes of cross-examination. Accordingly, defense counsel was given\n\nan opportunity to review the statement at the time of the trial. This supports a finding that\n\nthe statement was available and reviewed at the time of trial and was not falsely\n\nmanufactured for purposes of the post-conviction hearing.\n\n\n\n                              VII. Brady and Giglio Claims\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in finding that he\n\nhad failed to establish claims under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, and\n\n\n\n                                             42\n\fGiglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763. Specifically, the petitioner submits that\n\nthe proof showed that prior to trial, the state was in possession of inconsistent statements\n\nof the four inmate witnesses who testified for the state and the statements of those four\n\ninmates that conflicted directly. The petitioner further submits that the proof showed that\n\nthe state was aware of the findings in Wood’s report on MCRCF, that the information was\n\nnot provided to defense counsel, and that Worthington’s testimony at trial directly conflicted\n\nwith Wood’s findings and conclusions.\n\n\n\n              On the petitioner’s Brady claims, the post-conviction court held that the\n\npetitioner failed to rebut the statutory presumption of waiver and, in the alternative, failed\n\nto meet his burden of proof to establish that the state violated any of the discovery\n\nguidelines which would qualify him for relief. As to the petitioner’s Giglio claim, the post-\n\nconviction court held that he “failed to meet his burden of proof to establish any violation\n\nof the Giglio rule. The proof simply does not establish that the state made any promises\n\nof immunity or leniency to the witnesses in exchange for testimony. There was no\n\nevidence that the prosecution withheld any documents or information of any kind that\n\nwould tend to impeach the credibility of the state’s witnesses.”\n\n\n\n              In Brady v. Maryland, the United States Supreme Court held that any\n\n\"suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates\n\ndue process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective\n\nof the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\" 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196-97.\n\nThe duty to disclose extends to all \"favorable information\" regardless of whether the\n\nevidence is admissible at trial. State v. Marshall, 845 S.W.2d 228, 232-33 (Tenn. Crim.\n\nApp. 1992). In Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 766, the\n\nSupreme Court held that both exculpatory and impeachment evidence fall under the Brady\n\nrule. See also, United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 3380, 87\n\nL.Ed.2d 481 (1985).\n\n\n\n              Before an accused is entitled to relief under this theory, he must establish\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\fseveral prerequisites: (a) the prosecution must have suppressed the evidence; (b) the\n\nevidence suppressed must have been favorable to the accused; and (c) the evidence must\n\nhave been material. See United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 674-75, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n3379-80; Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1196-97; State v. Edgin, 902\n\nS.W.2d 387, 390 (Tenn. 1995); Workman v. State, 868 S.W.2d 705, 709 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1993); Strouth v. State, 755 S.W.2d 819, 828 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1986). Evidence is\n\nconsidered material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been\n\ndisclosed to the defense, the results of the proceeding would have been different. United\n\nStates v. Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. at 3383.\n\n\n\n              In order to prove a Brady violation, a defendant must show that \"the favorable\n\nevidence could reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to\n\nundermine confidence in the verdict.\" Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555,\n\n1566, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). See also, Edgin, 902 S.W.2d at 390. There must be a\n\n\"reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of\n\nthe proceeding would have been different.\" Id. (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419,\n\n435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 1566). The Court in Kyles urged that the cumulative effect of the\n\nsuppressed evidence be considered to determine materiality. 514 U.S. at 436, 115 S.Ct.\n\nat 1567.\n\n\n\n              The state is not required to disclose information that the accused already\n\npossesses or is able to obtain, State v. Marshall, 845 S.W.2d 228, 233, or information\n\nwhich is not possessed by or under the control of the prosecution or another governmental\n\nagency. Id.\n\n\n\n              On appeal, the petitioner makes no specific claim that the state suppressed\n\ninformation regarding favors or immunity offered to witnesses. However, a review of the\n\nrecord confirms the post-conviction court’s finding that the petitioner failed to show that any\n\nfavors or immunity were given to any of the witnesses in exchange for their testimony.\n\nWorthington and the assistant district attorney generals who prosecuted the petitioner’s\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\fcase testified that at the beginning, they agreed that there would be no promises to\n\ninmates in exchange for testimony. Worthington believed that all the inmates who testified\n\nhad already been paroled at the time of the trial with the exception of Scates. After the\n\ntrial, as a courtesy, he wrote Scates a letter of appreciation for his testimony. At best, the\n\nproof showed that the state offered to protect any inmates willing to testify from possible\n\nretaliation.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner submits that the state should have provided the statements of\n\nthe four inmates who testified at trial because the statements were inconsistent. The\n\nstatements of the four inmates were suppressed by the state before trial, however, the\n\ndefense received the statements as Jencks material after each inmate testified and before\n\ncross-examination.\n\n\n\n               In State v. Caughron, 855 S.W.2d 526 (Tenn. 1993), our Supreme Court held\n\nthat “delayed disclosure requires an inquiry into whether the delay prevented the defense\n\nfrom using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant's\n\ncase.” Id. at 548. In United States v. Ingraldi, 793 F.2d 408, 413 (1st Cir.1986), the Court\n\nheld that defense counsel cured a potential Brady violation by failing to move for a\n\ncontinuance and then thoroughly cross-examining the witness.\n\n\n\n               In the present case, the state provided defense counsel with copies of the\n\ninmates’ statements after each inmate testified. Moreover, the trial court gave defense\n\ncounsel ample opportunity to review the statements before cross-examining each witness.\n\nThereafter, defense counsel was given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and\n\npoint out any inconsistencies in their statements and testimony. Accordingly, under\n\nCaughron, we find that defense counsel eliminated any Brady violation with regard to prior\n\nstatements of the inmates who testified on behalf of the state.\n\n\n\n               Finally, the petitioner contends that the state was required to disclose Wood’s\n\nreport regarding prison conditions at MCRCF. As previously stated, the state is not\n\n\n\n                                              45\n\frequired to disclose information that the accused is able to obtain. State v. Marshall, 845\n\nS.W.2d 228, 233. Here, the petitioner failed to show that the evaluation and report\n\nprepared by Wood, Report on conditions at selected Adult Correctional Facilities in the\n\nTennessee Department of Corrections (June 1985), was unavailable to defense counsel.\n\n\n\n                 VIII. Constitutionality of the Death Penalty Statutes\n\n\n\n              The petitioner raises several constitutional challenges to T.C.A. §§ 39-2-204\n\nand -206 (repealed 1989). To the extent that the petitioner challenged the constitutionality\n\nof the death penalty statutes on direct appeal, Sutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 768, these claims\n\nhave been previously determined. See T.C.A. § 40-30-112(a) (1990). Otherwise, the\n\nissues have been waived.       See T.C.A. § 40-30-112(b)(1) (1990).       Regardless, our\n\nSupreme Court has held repeatedly that the death penalty statutes are constitutional.\n\n\n\n              Initially, the petitioner contends that the death penalty statutes fail to\n\nmeaningfully narrow the class of death eligible defendants. Specifically, he argues that the\n\naggravating circumstance set forth in T.C.A. § 39-2-204(i)(5) (repealed 1989), that the\n\nmurder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, is vague and overbroad. Acknowledging that this\n\nissue has been addressed by our Supreme Court in State v. Williams, 690 S.W.2d 517,\n\n526-30, the petitioner submits that the opinion was in error.\n\n\n\n              As an intermediate appellate court, it is our duty to apply the law as\n\npromulgated by the Legislature or as announced by our Supreme Court. It is beyond our\n\nstatutory function to overrule a holding of our Supreme Court, and we are bound to follow\n\nthe holding in Williams under the doctrine of stare decisis. See Reimann v. Huddleston,\n\n883 S.W.2d 135, 137 (Tenn. App. 1993). Moreover, our Supreme Court has repeatedly\n\nupheld its decision in Williams, rejecting the argument that this aggravating circumstance\n\nwas unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. See State v. Black, 815 S.W.2d 166, 181-82\n\n(Tenn. 1991); State v. Barber, 753 S.W.2d 659, 670 (Tenn. 1988).\n\n\n\n\n                                            46\n\f              Next, the petitioner contends that the death penalty is imposed in a capricious\n\nand arbitrary manner.      Specifically, he contends that the death penalty statute is\n\nunconstitutional because it requires that the jury be instructed that it must agree\n\nunanimously in order to impose a life sentence and is prohibited from being told the effect\n\nof a non-unanimous verdict. While admitting that this jury instruction has been upheld by\n\nour Supreme Court on numerous occasions, the petitioner contends that the Supreme\n\nCourt has never considered the possibility that juries may act arbitrarily because of\n\nconfusion regarding the consequences of a deadlock. Again, our Supreme Court has held\n\nthis portion of the statute to be constitutional, see State v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 87,\n\nState v. Smith, 857 S.W.2d 1, 22-23 (Tenn. 1993), and State v. Barber, 753 S.W.2d 659,\n\n670-71, and this Court declines the petitioner’s invitation to reconsider its constitutionality.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that the jury instructions imply that jurors are\n\nrequired to agree unanimously to a life verdict and to the existence of mitigating\n\ncircumstances in violation of Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d\n\n384 (1988), and McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 1233, 108\n\nL.Ed.2d 369 (1990). These arguments have been rejected by our Supreme Court. See\n\nState v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 87; State v. Thompson, 768 S.W.2d 239, 251-52 (Tenn.\n\n1989); State v. Bates, 804 S.W.2d 868, 883.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that the appellate review process is\n\nconstitutionally inadequate in its application. Specifically, the petitioner contends that the\n\nappellate review process is not constitutionally meaningful because the appellate courts\n\ncannot reweigh proof due to the absence of written findings concerning mitigating\n\ncircumstances, because the information relied upon by the appellate courts is inadequate\n\nand incomplete, and because the appellate courts’ methodology is flawed.                 These\n\narguments have all been rejected. See State v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 87-88; State v.\n\nCazes, 875 S.W.2d 253, 270-71 (Tenn. 1994).\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner contends that the statutorily mandated proportionality\n\n\n\n                                              47\n\freview is conducted in violation of due process. Our Supreme Court has held that the\n\nappellate review provided for in the statute affords a meaningful proportionality review.\n\nSee State v. Brimmer, 876 S.W.2d 75, 87-88; State v. Cazes, 875 S.W.2d 253, 270-71.\n\nMoreover, the petitioner’s claim that our Supreme Court has never found a death sentence\n\nto be imposed in a disproportionate manner is untrue. In State v. Branam, 855 S.W.2d 563\n\n(Tenn. 1993), the Supreme Court found the death penalty to be disproportionate and\n\nreduced the defendant's sentence to life. Id. at 570-71. The petitioner’s claims regarding\n\nthe constitutionality of the death penalty statutes are waived, previously determined, and\n\nwithout merit.\n\n\n\n                 IX. Imposition of Death Penalty Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner contends that because the state failed to provide safe\n\nand constitutional conditions in prison at the time of the murder, imposition of the death\n\npenalty would be arbitrary, capricious, and fundamentally unfair. This issue was previously\n\ndetermined by our Supreme Court on direct appeal. The Court held that “imposition of the\n\ndeath penalty by the jury was neither arbitrary nor excessive or disproportionate to the\n\npenalty imposed for similar crimes.” State v. Sutton, 761 S.W.2d 763, 768.\n\n\n\n                                     X. Conclusion\n\n\n\n              After thoroughly reviewing the record and the law applicable to the issues\n\nraised in this appeal, we find that the petitioner has failed to prove his allegations by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence. State v. Kerley, 820 S.W.2d 753, 755 (Tenn. Crim. App.\n\n1991). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s sentence of death by electrocution shall be carried out on\n\nAugust 31, 1999, unless otherwise stayed by an appropriate order.\n\n\n\n\n                                            48\n\f                                         _________________________________\n                                         JOHN K.

Thereafter,\n\nSenior Judge William H. Inman was appointed to hear the petition on November 18, 1994.\n\nIn March 1996, Judge Inman granted the petitioner’s motion requesting that he recuse\n\nhimself, and Judge Gary R. Wade was appointed to hear the petition. The post-conviction\n\nhearing was held over a period of five days from October 9 to October 14, 1996. On\n\nOctober 23, 1996, the post-conviction court denied post-conviction relief.\n\n\n\n             On appeal, the petitioner raises the following issues:\n\n\n\n      1.     Whether the state abused the discovery process, mislead and\n             misdirected the energies of petitioner’s attorney, and\n             concealed the state’s major witnesses, and whether the post-\n             conviction court erred in concluding that the issue had been\n             previously determined.\n\n      2.     Whether the trial court failed to regulate the discovery process,\n             and whether the post-conviction court erred in concluding that\n             the issue had been waived or previously determined.\n\n      3.     Whether excessive courtroom security denied the petitioner his\n             right to a fair trial, and whether the post-conviction court erred\n             in concluding that the issue had been waived or previously\n             determined.\n\n      4.     Whether the petitioner was denied the effective assistance of\n             counsel at the guilt and penalty phases of his trial.\n\n      5.     Whether the state falsely portrayed inmate safety and security\n             at the prison.\n\n                                             1\n\f       6.     Whether the state manufactured a prior statement by inmate\n              Lumbert for the post-conviction hearing, and whether the post-\n              conviction court erred by failing to address the issue.\n\n       7.

Street were residents of Guild 6 at the Morgan County Regional\n\nCorrectional Facility (“MCRCF”) on the day of the murder. The victim, Carl Estep, was a\n\nresident of Guild 5.\n\n\n\n              On January 15, 1985, when Estep was murdered, there was no correctional\n\nofficer in Guild 5 between 9:30 and 10:00 a.m. During a routine \"shakedown\" after 10:00\n\na.m., correctional officers found the body of Estep lying on the lower bunk of his cell.\n\nThere were signs of a struggle and blood was observed on the wall, the bed covers, and\n\non Estep's body. Attempts to revive Estep were unsuccessful. The entire facility was then\n\n\"locked down,\" and all inmates in Guild 5 were interviewed.\n\n\n\n              Estep, who had been serving a sentence for child molesting, had been\n\nstabbed thirty-eight times in the chest and neck. Most of the wounds were superficial, but\n\nnine were potentially fatal, having penetrated Estep's lungs, vena cava, and carotid artery.\n\nThe examining pathologist testified that this latter wound would have caused death in a\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\fmatter of minutes. There were seven defensive wounds on Estep's hands and right arm\n\nand a wound to the back of his head caused by a blow. It was the opinion of the\n\npathologist that from the size of the wounds, two knives had been used by Estep's\n\nattackers. On the bottom bunk, investigating officers found two homemade knives, which\n\nmatched the wounds on Estep's body. A later investigation of the cell uncovered a third\n\nknife hidden under a lamp beside Estep's bed.\n\n\n\n              The testimony of four inmates, sometimes contradictory and evasive, linked\n\nthe petitioner to the murder. The first to testify was Harold Meadows, a resident of Guild\n\n5. He testified that he was sitting in the day room area when he saw the petitioner and\n\nStreet enter the guild and go straight to Estep's cell. He stated that each day between 9:30\n\na.m. and shortly after 10:00 a.m. there was a period of five to ten minutes when no guards\n\nwere in Guild 5 due to a duty change. It was during this time on January 15, that he\n\nobserved the petitioner and Street enter the guild. When they entered Estep's cell, his\n\nroommate immediately came out and shortly thereafter the volume of the tv or radio\n\nincreased, and Meadows heard a scream, and the petitioner and Street came out. When\n\nquestioned by correctional officers immediately after the incident, Meadows told them what\n\nhe had seen and identified the petitioner and Street from a photographic line-up. Meadows\n\nfurther testified that on Sunday, January 13, he had seen Estep having a \"physical\n\ndiscussion\" with the petitioner and Street, during which the petitioner held a knife to Estep's\n\nthroat.\n\n\n\n              Another resident of Guild 5, Estel Green, testified that he was standing in\n\nfront of the door to his cell, right next to Estep's cell, when he saw the petitioner and\n\nanother inmate go inside Estep's cell. Green then went into his cell. When he came back\n\nout, he saw the other men in the guild moving toward the back away from Estep's cell.\n\nGreen moved away with them and heard Estep \"holler out. He said, 'Don't do that; please\n\ndon't do that.' and then he hollered louder, he hollered, 'Somebody help me; somebody\n\nplease help me.' and that was all I heard.\" Green was not able to see who left Estep's cell.\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f              Ralph Edward Scates was a resident of Guild 3, but he worked as a laundry\n\nman in Guild 1. Scates testified that he had a casual conversation with Street while Street\n\nwas confined to Guild 1 for investigative purposes after the killing. Street admitted to\n\nScates that \"he [Street] cut him ... he stuck him, cut his throat.\" Street said that homemade\n\nknives had been used and that he had tried to flush his down the commode in his cell in\n\nGuild 6. Scates stated that the petitioner had told him, \"The SB got exactly what he\n\ndeserved.\"\n\n\n\n              The last inmate to testify for the state was Cary Scoggins. He testified that\n\nEstep was a marijuana dealer at the facility and had sold the defendants some \"bad\n\nmerchandise\" and had refused to refund the defendants' money. He testified that after the\n\ndefendants took Estep's watch and some other articles, Estep had threatened to kill the\n\npetitioner. Scoggins, a resident of Guild 6, happened to be in Guild 5 on the morning of\n\nJanuary 15 between 9:30 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. He stated that he saw the petitioner, Street,\n\nand Freeman come into the guild and enter Estep's cell. He looked through the window\n\nin the door of Estep's cell, a vertical window four inches by thirteen inches and saw all\n\nthree defendants standing in front of the bunk bed with their backs to the window. He saw\n\nEstep try to get up from the bottom bunk and the petitioner and Freeman pulled knives.\n\nThe petitioner started to stab Estep, who screamed. Scoggins stated that the petitioner\n\n\"just kept on stabbing\" about sixteen times. The three defendants then washed their hands\n\nin the sink. Scoggins then moved away from the door and left the guild before the\n\ndefendants did.\n\n\n\n              In order to contradict Scoggins' testimony, co-defendant Freeman presented\n\nthe testimony of Gary Lumbert, Scoggins' cellmate. Lumbert testified that Scoggins was\n\nworking with him in the prison library at the time Estep was murdered.\n\n\n\n              The state recalled James Worthington, the administrative assistant to the\n\nwarden at the time of the killing, and he testified that he had investigated the murder. He\n\nstated that Lumbert had told him that he was present in Guild 6 immediately after Estep\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fhad been killed, and that he observed the petitioner and Street enter the guild, remove\n\ntheir clothes, and place their clothes in the laundry. Lumbert also told Worthington that the\n\npetitioner bragged \"about stabbing Carl Estep twenty-some times.\"\n\n\n\n              On January 15, two garbage bags found outside Guild 8 were brought to\n\nWorthington, one containing trash and the other prison clothing. A telephone pass for\n\nFreeman was found in one pair of the pants. F.B.I. analysis of the debris from the clothing\n\nin the garbage bag revealed a hair consistent with that of the victim on a pair of button-fly\n\njeans and a hair consistent with that of Freeman on one of the jackets. A forensic\n\nserologist employed by the T.B.I. testified that she was able to identify a human blood stain\n\nmatching the victim's blood type on the sleeve of one of the jackets, one of the knives, and\n\na work shirt. She also found human blood on one of the jackets, a pair of zipper-fly blue\n\njeans and an elastic bandage. Tests were inconclusive as to whether human blood was\n\non the other knife.\n\n\n\n              Based on this proof, the jury found the petitioner guilty of first-degree murder.\n\n\n\n              At the sentencing hearing, the state presented proof that the petitioner had\n\npreviously been convicted of first-degree murder. The defense presented the testimony\n\nof Charles Burchett, the Director of Student Conduct at the University of Tennessee, his\n\nwife, a semi-retired school teacher, and their son, Charles Burchett, Jr., who was a real\n\nestate agent. The Burchetts testified that they had known the petitioner since he was in\n\nhigh school and that they visited him in prison regularly. The defense also presented the\n\ntestimony of two inmates. Eddie O’Donnell, the petitioner’s cellmate in Guild 6, testified\n\nthat on January 14, while they were eating in the dining hall, the petitioner asked O’Donnell\n\nto tell him if Estep came toward him. When Estep came in, O’Donnell nodded at the\n\npetitioner, who stood up. Estep then walked the other way. James “Buddy” Williams, also\n\nan inmate, testified that he did not have any conversations with the petitioner about this\n\nmatter, despite having previously told defense counsel that he had in fact had\n\nconversations with the petitioner. Williams refused to answer any further questions.\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f              The jury sentenced the petitioner to death by electrocution based on its\n\nfinding that there were no mitigating circumstances sufficient to outweigh the three\n\naggravating circumstances: (1) prior conviction of a violent felony, (2) the murder was\n\nheinous, atrocious, or cruel, and (3) the murder was committed while the petitioner was in\n\na place of lawful confinement. T.C.A. § 39-2-203(i)(2), (5), (8) (repealed 1989).\n\n\n\n                                   Standard of Review\n\n\n\n              In post-conviction proceedings, the petitioner must prove the allegations\n\ncontained in his petition by a preponderance of the evidence.

Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n\n\n              In his first issue, the petitioner contends that he was denied a fair trial\n\nbecause the state abused the discovery process, mislead and misdirected the energies of\n\npetitioner’s attorney, and concealed its major witnesses. The petitioner submits that the\n\npost-conviction court erred in finding this issue to be previously determined.\n\n\n\n              Specifically, the petitioner argues that he was unable to establish his\n\nprosecutorial misconduct claim on direct appeal because he was denied access to material\n\ndocuments which would have demonstrated an intentional decision by the state to\n\nmisdirect defense counsel. Second, the petitioner argues that he was unable to show in\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthe prior proceedings how he was prejudiced by the intentional wrongdoing of the state\n\nbecause his attorney could not challenge his own ineffectiveness without creating a conflict\n\nof interest.\n\n\n\n               Under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act governing this petition, a petitioner\n\ncould raise all constitutional claims except those which had been previously determined,\n\nwaived, or barred by the statute of limitations.        The statutory definitions under the\n\napplicable Post-Conviction Procedure Act for previous determination and waiver were as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n\n               (a) A ground for relief is “previously determined” if a court of\n               competent jurisdiction has ruled on the merits after a full and\n               fair hearing.\n\n               (b)(1) A ground for relief is “waived” if the petitioner knowingly\n               and understandingly failed to present it for determination in any\n               proceeding before a court of competent jurisdiction in which\n               the ground could have been presented.\n\n               (2) There is a rebuttable presumption that a ground for relief\n               not raised in any such proceeding which was held was waived.\n\n\n\nT.C.A. § 40-30-112 (1990).\n\n\n\n               In House v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1667501\"><a href=\"/opinion/1667501/house-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">911</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1995), our Supreme Court held\n\nthat “a ‘full and fair hearing’ sufficient to support a finding of previous determination occurs\n\nif a petitioner is given the opportunity to present proof and argument.” Id. at 706. The\n\nburden is on the post-conviction petitioner to allege facts to overcome the application of\n\nprocedural barriers. Smith v.

He argues that by providing\n      lists of numerous prospective witnesses, ranging from 80 to 47 names, many\n      of whom were inmates scattered throughout the State correctional system\n      and most of whom the State, defendant alleges, had no intention of calling,\n      denied him his right to effective counsel because defense counsel was\n      unable to interview all these witnesses and investigate the case fully.\n      Nothing in the record supports this allegation. When defense counsel\n      pointed out the problems he was having in reaching all the witnesses, the\n      court granted a continuance.\n\n\n\nSutton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512158\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512158/state-v-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769.\n\n\n\n             Despite the petitioner’s claims, a full review of the record does not establish\n\nintentional wrongdoing on the part of the state.      Worthington testified that he was\n\nresponsible for the prison’s internal investigation into the murder of Estep. On the day of\n\nthe murder, Worthington and Clarence Robbins, the investigator for the district attorney\n\ngeneral’s office, conducted intensive interviews of everyone in Guild 5. Worthington was\n\nresponsible for transcribing and cataloging all of the statements.\n\n\n\n              In the course of the investigation, Worthington submitted to the district\n\nattorney general’s office a list of possible witnesses and a summary of each witness’\n\npotential testimony. Worthington kept a notebook which included summaries, statements,\n\nand documents regarding each person who was interviewed.              In addition, he kept\n\nmiscellaneous files that included rap sheets, different information, institutional file\n\ndocuments on each of the defendants and some of the witnesses, and notes he had made\n\nduring the investigation and interviews.\n\n\n\n              The list of potential witnesses was typed and sent to the district attorney\n\ngeneral’s office around June 3, 1985. Worthington testified that the entire list was given\n\nto the defense as a good faith effort so the defense would have a complete list of the\n\ninmates who had been interviewed. A shorter list was given in August 1985, and another\n\nwas given in September 1985. Worthington kept inmates on the witness list because he\n\nthought that once some of them were released from prison they might be willing to talk.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fHe also believed that the defense attorneys should be given an opportunity to speak with\n\nthese inmates because they might tell defense counsel more than they would tell the\n\nprison officials.\n\n\n\n               Roger Delp, an assistant district attorney general who prosecuted the case,\n\ntestified that the long list of potential witnesses was given to defense counsel to ensure\n\nthat the trial judge would not refuse to allow a witness to testify because the name had not\n\nbeen given to the defense. The state was concerned that some inmates who had been in\n\na position to have information about the homicide but were not talking might be willing to\n\ntalk to defense counsel or might decide to talk to the state at a later date. The state was\n\nalso trying to protect inmates from potential retaliation.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner was represented at trial by John Appman. Because the state’s\n\nlist of potential witnesses was long and because the inmates were constantly being\n\ntransferred to other facilities, Appman spent unnecessary time and trouble investigating\n\nthe case. Bruce Fox, appointed counsel for co-defendant Street, confirmed that it was\n\ndifficult to prepare for trial because the state’s witness list was so extensive. He and\n\nAppman did most of the preparation for trial, traveling in Appman’s private plane to\n\ninterview witnesses who were incarcerated at various correctional facilities across the\n\nstate. They were also assisted by Appman’s paralegal.\n\n\n\n               In order to tell which witnesses the state was going to call and to have an\n\nunderstanding of the state’s case, Appman believed he needed to review Worthington’s\n\ninvestigative records. However, even if he had been able to obtain a shorter list of\n\npotential witnesses, Appman testified that he still would have attempted to talk to anyone\n\nwho might have benefitted the case. He and Herb Moncier filed a motion with the trial\n\ncourt in an attempt to get Worthington’s notebook, however, the motion was denied.\n\nThereafter, they filed a lawsuit in the chancery court of Davidson County seeking to force\n\nWorthington to turn over his investigative records under the Public Records Act. Relief was\n\ndenied by the chancery court and by the Supreme Court on appeal. See Appman v.\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fWorthington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1521330\"><a href=\"/opinion/1521330/appman-v-worthington/\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">165</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1987).\n\n\n\n              Without Worthington’s notebook, Appman testified that he was unable to fully\n\nadvise the petitioner regarding the strength of the state’s case. Although the petitioner\n\ntestified that he would not have accepted the state’s offer of a life sentence because it was\n\nconditional on offers to the co-defendants, Appman believed that the information in\n\nWorthington’s notebook would have assisted him in his attempt to convince the petitioner\n\nto accept the offer. Despite the foreclosure of reviewing Worthington’s notebook, Appman\n\nwas able to interview all the inmates who eventually testified at trial on behalf of the state.\n\nHe was also able to review each of these witnesses’ statement to Worthington as Jencks\n\nmaterial prior to cross-examination.\n\n\n\n              A review of the testimony and of Worthington’s notebook does not reveal that\n\nthe state intentionally misdirected defense counsel, and this argument fails to rebut the\n\nstatutory presumption that this issue has been previously determined.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that the issue should not be barred as\n\npreviously determined because counsel could not have raised his own ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. However, the issue of whether the state’s actions denied the\n\npetitioner the right to effective counsel was raised and addressed by the Supreme Court.\n\nSutton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512158\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512158/state-v-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769. Moreover, the record reflects that Appman took every action\n\npossible to obtain Worthington’s notebook, including the filing of a civil law suit.\n\nAccordingly, even if the issue was not previously determined, the petitioner has failed to\n\nshow that counsel’s actions were deficient.

Regulation of Discovery Process\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in finding that the\n\nissue of whether the trial court failed to regulate the discovery process was previously\n\n\n\n                                              10\n\fdetermined, waived, or without merit. As to a finding of waiver, the petitioner contends that\n\nit was not raised due to ineffective assistance of counsel and that the material facts\n\nsupporting his claim were not available despite efforts to obtain access to the information.\n\nFurthermore, the petitioner contends that if the trial court had at a minimum reviewed\n\nWorthington’s notebook or included it in the record, it would have shown that the state had\n\nin fact prepared a shorter, detailed witness list which set forth the anticipated witnesses at\n\ntrial and their anticipated testimony.\n\n\n\n              As noted in the Supreme Court’s opinion, “[t]he evidence in the record does\n\nnot preponderate against the trial court's finding on the motion for new trial that there was\n\nno bad faith on the State's part in responding to the discovery requests, that the defendant\n\nwas not damaged by any of the delays in this case, and that under the circumstances all\n\nmatters were addressed within a reasonable time.”            Sutton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1512158\"><a href=\"/opinion/1512158/state-v-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">761</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 768.\n\nAccordingly, this issue has been previously determined. See T.C.A. § 40-30-112(a)(1990).\n\nFurthermore, the petitioner cannot succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nbecause the Supreme Court ruled that matters of discovery were handled appropriately.\n\nThus, the petitioner has not shown prejudice.

Courtroom Security\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that the post-conviction court erred in\n\nconcluding that the issue of excessive security in the courtroom was previously determined,\n\nwaived, or without merit. In his post-conviction petition, the petitioner claimed that the state\n\nused the extraordinary courtroom security as a prop, that he was denied a fair trial as a\n\nresult of the excessive courtroom security, that the trial court failed to regulate the\n\nexcessive courtroom security, and that defense counsel was ineffective in failing to limit the\n\nexcessive security, object to its use as a prop, or properly present the issue in the motion\n\nfor new trial and on direct appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f              Regarding this issue, Charles E. Jones, now warden at MCRCF, testified that\n\nhe was in charge of courtroom security during the petitioner’s trial. According to Jones, the\n\ngoal was to provide security during the trial and to ensure that inmates were transported\n\nin a timely manner, however, there was no written plan or order. Uniformed officers armed\n\nwith shotguns were stationed at each corner of the courthouse. Two officers with a hand\n\nheld metal detector were stationed outside the door to the courtroom.               Inside the\n\ncourtroom, officers were stationed at each door. Three more officers were stationed in the\n\nfront row directly behind the defendants. One officer was positioned to backup the three\n\nofficers by the defendants, one was next to the jury, and two were in the balcony. Some\n\nof the officers were in uniform, and all the officers were armed with the exception of the\n\nthree officers directly behind the defendants. One street by the courthouse was blocked\n\noff, and the officers used it for parking and unloading inmates.\n\n\n\n              Judge Eugene Eblen, who presided over the trial, testified that the officers\n\nin the courtroom were not overly conspicuous. Considering that there were three inmates\n\non trial and that many of the witnesses were also inmates, Judge Eblen believed that the\n\nsecurity was appropriate.\n\n\n\n              Contrary to this testimony, Fox, counsel for co-defendant Street, testified that\n\nthe courthouse was an “armed fortress.” Charles Burchett, who attended the trial and\n\ntestified on behalf of the petitioner at the sentencing hearing, testified that he was amazed\n\nat the number of armed officers.\n\n\n\n              On the general issue of courtroom security, the post-conviction court made\n\nthese findings:\n\n\n\n       Even if the issue had not been previously determined or waived, the proof at\n       the evidentiary hearing simply did not establish this as a ground for relief.\n       Obviously courtroom security is necessary when three prison inmates are on\n       trial. All of the key witnesses were inmates as well. The environment at the\n       trial, due to all this, was certainly not ideal. Nonetheless, the trial court took\n       measures to reduce any prejudicial effect. The defendants wore certain\n       clothes, their hands were free, and measures were taken to hide from the\n       jury the shackles on their feet. Moreover, Morgan County, with two state\n\n\n                                              12\n\f         prison facilities in 1986, is more likely than other counties to be desensitized\n         to a possibly coercive atmosphere.\n\n\n\n                Before introducing the homemade knives into evidence, General Harvey\n\nplaced them on the defense table so that defense counsel would have an opportunity to\n\nexamine the knives. This was done even though defense counsel had been instructed to\n\nonly use felt tip pens, not pencils, so that the defendants could not use the pencils as\n\nweapons in taking hostages. Appman testified that he reacted by jerking away from the\n\ntable because he was afraid of becoming a hostage. According to Appman, it was a tense\n\nmoment in the courtroom. Being startled, Appman did not make a motion for a mistrial or\n\nraise the issue at that time.\n\n\n\n                Judge Eblen testified that it is common practice for lawyers to approach\n\nopposing counsel and present an exhibit before it is introduced into evidence. When the\n\nprosecutor placed the homemade knives on the defense table, Judge Eblen saw Appman\n\njump, and he heard an officer pull a gun, although he did not see any guns drawn.\n\nAccording to Judge Eblen, the courtroom quickly quieted down, and the jury seemed to get\n\na “smile” out of the incident. Judge Eblen believed that he told the prosecutor not to do it\n\nagain.\n\n\n\n                The post-conviction court accredited the testimony of Judge Eblen on this\n\nissue:\n\n\n\n         Moreover, Judge Eblen testified that this was really “not a big event in\n         Morgan County” and that the “officers were not overly conspicuous.” While\n         Judge Eblen expressed some concern about the incident wherein an\n         assistant district attorney general placed several knives at the table occupied\n         by the defendants and their counsel, John Appman reacted with some\n         surprise. The record demonstrates, however, that there were curative\n         instructions. It was Judge Eblen’s opinion that the incident did not affect the\n         results of the trial. This court accredits that account.\n\n\n\n                Regarding the placing of knives on defense table, the post-conviction court\n\nproperly held that the issue has been previously determined. T.C.A. § 40-30-112(a)\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f(1990). In fact, Jones was called to testify about the courtroom security at the hearing on\n\nthe motions for new trial. Jones, who was in charge of courtroom security, testified that\n\nthere were ten to fourteen guards in the courtroom, some of whom were in civilian clothes.\n\nWhile some of the guards had pistols, no one in the courtroom had a shotgun. When the\n\nknives were placed on the table, the officers in the courtroom reached for their guns,\n\nhowever, no pistols were drawn. On direct appeal, the Supreme Court ruled:\n\n\n\n       The defendant also alleges prosecutorial misconduct by the Assistant District\n       Attorney General. A knife, identified by State's witness James Worthington\n       as a weapon found in Estep's cell after the murder, was placed on the\n       defense table for inspection by counsel before passing it to the jury. Seeing\n       the knife within reach of the defendants, a number of the correctional officers\n       in the courtroom responded by reaching for their weapons. Defendant insists\n       that the reactions by the guards prejudiced him and deprived him of the\n       \"physical indicia of innocence.\" After the incident, the court instructed the\n       State to have defense counsel examine the weapons at the State's table.\n       The jury knew that the defendants were inmates and it probably came as no\n       surprise to the jurors that they would be closely watched and guarded. The\n       record reflects that only one such incident occurred. We do not find that this\n       incident could have so prejudiced the defendant as to deny him a fair trial.\n       We find no reversible error.\n\n\n\nState v.

T.C.A. § 40-30-112(b)(1) (1990). Finally, the petitioner has failed to meet his\n\nburden to show ineffective assistance of counsel regarding this issue. As stated earlier,\n\non appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief, the findings of fact and conclusions of\n\nlaw made by the trial court are given the weight of a jury verdict, and this Court is bound\n\nby those findings unless the evidence contained in the record preponderates otherwise.\n\nButler v.

Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n\n\n               The petitioner raises several issues regarding the effectiveness of defense\n\ncounsel pre-trial, at trial, post-trial, and on direct appeal.

Crim. App. 1985). Should the petitioner fail to\n\nestablish either factor, he is not entitled to relief.\n\n\n\n(A) Failure to File a Motion to Strike “Lawful Custody” Aggravating Circumstance\n\n\n\n               The petitioner contends that counsel was ineffective by failing to research,\n\ninvestigate, and/or file a motion seeking to strike the aggravating circumstance that the\n\npetitioner was in lawful custody at the time of the offense. Despite defense counsel’s self-\n\ndefense theory that the victim’s death threats had to be taken seriously because the prison\n\nwas so dangerous and there was no place where inmates were safe, counsel failed to\n\ninvestigate or challenge the state’s use of this aggravating circumstance. The petitioner\n\nfurther argues that evidence of prison conditions could have been used to mitigate the\n\ncircumstances of the crime at both the guilt and sentencing phases.\n\n\n\n               In denying relief, the post-conviction court held:\n\n\n                                               15\n\f       This ground does not serve as a basis for post-conviction relief. That the\n       prison was less safe than most other places would not have excused the\n       murder. There was some proof at trial that the prison had a dangerous\n       atmosphere, requiring vigilance on the part of the inmates. This court does\n       not disagree. But that would not have warranted striking this particular\n       aggravating circumstance. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-2-203(i)(8)(1982).\n       Thus, there is neither deficiency in performance on the part of trial counsel\n       nor prejudice in result.\n\n\n\n              We find that the post-conviction court’s findings are supported by the record.\n\nInitially, counsel for the petitioner investigated the conditions at the prison. Every inmate\n\nwho testified at the guilt and sentencing phases was asked questions regarding safety and\n\nthe meaning of a threat in prison. Moreover, defense counsel presented the testimony of\n\nCarl Crafton, a long-term inmate, who was qualified as an expert on prison life. Crafton\n\nexplained the seriousness of a death threat in prison. However, Appman was not aware\n\nthat the state of Tennessee had hired Frank Wood in 1985 to perform an evaluation of the\n\nprison system. At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner presented Wood’s testimony\n\nregarding his findings. As part of his evaluation, Wood visited nine institutions, including\n\nMCRCF.\n\n\n\n              Based on his inspection, Wood found serious deficiencies in the Tennessee\n\nDepartment of Correction (“TDOC”), especially regarding overcrowding. Wood found that\n\nthe number of inmates was beyond the design capacity of the facilities. Moreover, the\n\nclassification systems were nonfunctional. Inmates were not assigned to appropriate\n\ninstitutions, and exceptions were made constantly. As part of this problem, institutions\n\nwere being used to house inmates who were beyond the classification for which the\n\ninstitution was designed. There was also an unusually high volume of inmate movement\n\nand transfers between institutions. The violence at the prisons was systemic, with a high\n\nfrequency of assaults on staff and on other inmates. There was also an extremely high\n\nturnover among uniformed staff.\n\n\n\n              Wood noted that an unusual number of inmates in the system were\n\nrequesting voluntary protective custody. Because of the punitive segregation status and\n\nbecause an inmate could end up being in protective custody for years, Wood opined that\n\n\n                                             16\n\fit would take a high level of motivation for an inmate to commit himself to voluntary\n\nsegregation as the only option for protecting himself. Such a person might become preyed\n\nupon as a victim personality or as someone who may not be able to handle prison life\n\nwithout resorting to protective custody.\n\n\n\n              At MCRCF, Wood found overcrowding and staff shortages. The physical\n\nplant was not designed to keep the classification of inmates that were there. Units were\n\nleft unattended at different times during the day. In Wood’s opinion, MCRCF was held\n\ntogether at the time because of the commitment and hard work of the warden and staff to\n\nmaintain a rapport with the inmate population.\n\n\n\n              In reviewing the petitioner’s files from TDOC, it was Wood’s opinion that the\n\npetitioner had been inappropriately classified based on his history of violent behavior. The\n\npetitioner should have been in a situation where there was adequate staffing, supervision,\n\ncontrol, and accountability for his behavior. In Wood’s opinion, a person serving a life\n\nwithout parole sentence should not be housed in a medium security facility. While Wood\n\ndid not think that the conditions at MCRCF mitigated the petitioner’s actions, he did think\n\nthat the system had a responsibility to control inmates like the petitioner and that the state\n\nshould hold some culpability for the way the institution was managed.              The poor\n\nmanagement put other inmates in danger and also failed to provide the petitioner with the\n\nappropriate level of control.\n\n\n\n              Appman’s theory at trial was based on reasonable doubt, but that if the\n\npetitioner did commit the homicide, it was self-defense. He testified that if he had received\n\nWood’s report on prison conditions, he could have shown the jury that the tension in prison\n\nwas enormous and that the petitioner’s reaction was normal under the circumstances.\n\nMoreover, he could have shown that the violence was not directed toward the officers,\n\nwhich would have been important because of the high number of people in Morgan County\n\nwho were employed by TDOC.\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\f               In addition to Wood’s report, Appman did not know about Grubbs v. Bradley,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525743\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525743/grubbs-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

At the post-conviction\n\nhearing, the petitioner presented considerable proof on the conditions in TDOC, however,\n\nin preparing for trial, Appman had not reviewed these materials. He admitted at the\n\nhearing that this information would have assisted in the defense of the petitioner in that it\n\nwould have further explained the environment in which the homicide occurred.\n\n\n\n               While this additional information regarding prison conditions would have\n\nsupported Crafton’s testimony, it would not have provided a basis for striking the\n\naggravating circumstance. The petitioner has not shown that proof of dangerous prison\n\nconditions would warrant a ruling that the murder did not occur while the petitioner was in\n\nlawful custody, and he has failed to show that counsel’s performance was deficient or that\n\nhe was prejudiced.\n\n\n\n    (B) Failure to Prepare for and Present Evidence at the Sentencing Hearing\n\n\n\n               The petitioner contends that counsel’s failure to conduct any investigation of\n\nthe petitioner’s medical, family, social, educational, juvenile, military, institutional, or prior\n\ncriminal history, and defense counsel’s decision not to present such evidence at the\n\nsentencing hearing was not an informed decision, was facially deficient, and prejudiced the\n\npetitioner.\n\n\n\n               In death penalty cases, the sentencer may not be precluded from considering\n\nany aspect of a defendant’s character or record as a basis for a sentence less than death.\n\nLockett v.

At the penalty phase, the defense called the defendant’s mother to\n\nthe stand. In the presence of the jury, she disrupted her own testimony by announcing that\n\nshe wanted “to talk to” defense counsel. A recess was had, followed by the defense\n\nresuming its proof by calling the defendant’s grandmother, without explaining the failure\n\nof the defendant’s mother to return to the stand. The grandmother testified to various\n\nattributes of the defendant, and the defendant himself testified about a financial reversal\n\nthat caused him to lose his grandfather’s farm. Id. at 575-76. The jury sentenced the\n\ndefendant to death, based upon finding one aggravating factor in each homicide, that each\n\nmurder was “‘especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that it involved torture or depravity\n\nof mind.’” Id. at 576; see T.C.A. § 39-2-203(I)(5) (repealed 1989). In his post-conviction\n\nproceeding, Henley alleged his counsel failed to investigate and prepare for the sentencing\n\nhearing, including the claims that counsel failed to investigate his mental condition and\n\nrequest an appropriate evaluation.\n\n\n\n              Henley presented two expert witnesses at the post-conviction hearing: (1) an\n\nattorney, who testified that trial counsel should have used a psychologist to assist in\n\ndetermining if mitigating proof might be feasible; and (2) a psychiatrist, who interviewed\n\nHenley and testified that, at the time of the offenses, he suffered from depression and may\n\nhave been “‘self-medicating’ by using alcohol and drugs.” Id. at 577.

In preparing for the sentencing hearing, he\n\nobtained Estep’s prison file and spoke with either Estep’s mother or wife, as well as the\n\nattorney representing them in a victim compensation law suit. He also spoke with Dr. Doug\n\nYoung with the York Institute, who had previously been in charge of the educational\n\nprograms at Lake County Correctional facility. Based on his review of the petitioner’s\n\nvisitor records at the prison, Appman interviewed the Burchett family and had them testify\n\nto show that the petitioner could relate to credible people in a meaningful way. In addition,\n\nAppman presented proof that the victim had been a child molester, and Crafton had\n\ntestified at trial that the environment within the prison was different from the free world and\n\nthat when a threat was made, an inmate could not move out or call on law enforcement to\n\nprotect him.\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f             Appman obtained the petitioner’s TDOC records, but he did not attempt to\n\nget school or juvenile records or the transcript of the petitioner’s trial for killing his\n\ngrandmother. While Appman might have discussed with the petitioner his military record,\n\nhe did not attempt to obtain it. Appman filed a motion requesting the services of a\n\npsychiatrist, but the trial court denied the motion. The trial court offered to have the\n\npetitioner evaluated by the Tennessee Department of Mental Health, however, counsel\n\ndeclined this invitation. He did not seek funds for a mitigation or sentencing expert.\n\n\n\n              Under the three factors set forth in Goad, we must first look at the “nature\n\nand extent of the mitigating evidence that was available but not presented.” Goad, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1061016\"><a href=\"/opinion/1061016/goad-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371. At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner presented testimony of two\n\nfriends who knew him in middle school and high school. Both would have been available\n\nand willing to testify at the sentencing hearing. He also presented the testimony of a\n\ndeputy at the Hamblen County Jail who indicated that the petitioner probably saved his life\n\nin 1978 when he was trying to break up a fight between two other inmates.\n\n\n\n             Dr. Gillian Blair, a licensed clinical psychologist, testified on behalf of the\n\npetitioner regarding the existence of factors which might have been presented as mitigating\n\nevidence at the sentencing phase. Blair concluded that the petitioner was raised in an\n\nunstable, often violent and threatening home life where the supervision and structure were\n\ninadequate. He was exposed as a child to intermittent explosive violence from his father,\n\nwho was seriously mentally ill and was hospitalized extensively at a psychiatric hospital\n\nbetween 1969 to 1976. In 1973, there was a restraining order against the father after he\n\nheld his mother and the petitioner at gun point and had a standoff with the police. In\n\ncontrast, when the petitioner’s father was not being violent, he would be overindulgent and\n\nencourage inappropriate behavior. In 1977, the petitioner’s father died of hypothermia and\n\nexposure. The death certificate indicated that alcohol abuse was a contributing factor in\n\nhis death.\n\n\n\n              From the time of his incarceration at age 18, the threatening environment that\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\fthe petitioner had endured as a child was present in TDOC. The prison offered little\n\nstructure or predictability. The petitioner had to be hyper-vigilant, and this was exacerbated\n\nby the fact that a number of inmates had access to weapons and that there were a number\n\nof assaults in prison.\n\n\n\n              As a child, the petitioner suffered multiple abandonments and losses.\n\nSpecifically, his mother abandoned him before the age of one, he essentially lost his father\n\nto mental illness, and ultimately he suffered the death of his father. Moreover, the\n\ncircumstances of his father’s death were never explained to him. The petitioner also\n\nsuffered the loss of his grandfather at the age of 7 or 8, and the separation from his\n\nmaternal grandparents at the age of 2. He was essentially raised by his paternal\n\ngrandmother, who was a school teacher.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner has an extensive drug history. By the time he was an\n\nadolescent, he was using a wide variety of drugs. The petitioner admitted the he had dealt\n\ndrugs extensively as well, to provide a means of obtaining his own drugs and to provide\n\nhimself some money. His lack of internal controls was exacerbated by his drug use.\n\n\n\n              Eventually, the petitioner’s juvenile problems and drug abuse led to him being\n\nsent to Knoxville to live with his aunt and attend high school. While he failed some\n\nclasses, he did not fail a grade. He eventually dropped out of high school during the\n\neleventh grade. In 1978, the petitioner received his GED at a community college. At age\n\n17, the petitioner joined the Navy from November to December of 1978. He received an\n\nhonorable discharge, however, the records indicate that he was unable to adjust to military\n\nlife. The petitioner was described as being overwhelmed by the training and unable to\n\nadjust to the emotional pressure. According to the records, the petitioner’s attitude toward\n\nauthority was respectful. Thereafter, the petitioner was incarcerated at the age of 18 and\n\nhas been incarcerated continually since that time.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s medical records were limited. He was shot in the eye at the\n\n\n\n                                             23\n\fage of 9. He had several head injuries which lead to a loss of consciousness. One such\n\nincident involved a motorcycle accident when the petitioner was 12. The petitioner also\n\nsuffered sporting accidents at age 13 and 15. In addition, the petitioner was shot in the\n\nknee at the age of 16. There is no record of the petitioner having any psychiatric history\n\nor treatment before entering TDOC.\n\n\n\n                According to Blair, the TDOC records indicated that if kept in a safe and\n\nstructured environment, the petitioner is well-adjusted, presents no management problems,\n\nand is not violent. Blair admitted that at the time of the trial, her profession felt that it was\n\ndifficult to predict future dangerousness and that the key indicator was a past history of\n\nviolence. She further admitted that this factor would not have weighed in favor of the\n\npetitioner.\n\n\n\n                Blair concluded that the cumulative data, social history, interview, and test\n\nresults supported personality traits that would have rendered the petitioner vulnerable to\n\nprevailing conditions in TDOC during the early 1980s. Those conditions included an\n\nunstable, violent, and threatening environment, where supervision and structure were\n\ninadequate to the number of inmates. She did not find any sign of cognitive impairment\n\nor organic process. Nor did Blair find any suggestion of thought disorder or any type of\n\npsychosis.\n\n\n\n                Blair’s primary diagnosis was that the petitioner has an Axis II personality\n\ndisorder.     Tension consistent with an underlying anxiety disorder was also evident.\n\nAccording to Blair, individuals with these profiles tend to be blunt, self-critical, and have\n\ninadequate defense mechanisms. The observed clinical profile was consistent with a\n\npattern of chronic maladjustment. These individuals tend to be suspicious, alienated, self-\n\nindulgent, and narcissistic, with immature, manipulative, and somewhat aggressive\n\nbehaviors. Blair agreed with a previous diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder.\n\n\n\n                In rebuttal, the state presented the testimony of Dr. Theodore H. Blau, a\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\fclinical psychologist from Tampa, Florida. Rather than conduct his own mental tests or\n\nevaluations on the petitioner, Blau based his opinion on the psychological evaluation\n\nperformed by Blair, which he described as excellent. Although he admitted that it was\n\ndifficult to evaluate someone’s mental status from 11 years earlier, Blau made four basic\n\nconclusions based on his review and evaluation of the petitioner. First, Blau found no\n\nindications that the petitioner, in January 1985, suffered a mental disease or defect which\n\nwould cause him to lack an understanding of the wrongfulness of his act or to prevent him\n\nfrom conforming to the requirements of the law. Second, Blau found no indications that\n\nthe petitioner, in January 1985, suffered a mental disease or defect which substantially\n\naffected his intellect or judgment.     Third, Blau found no indications that the prison\n\nconditions in January 1985 caused or exacerbated a mental disease or defect in the\n\npetitioner. Finally, Blau found nothing in the record or in the research reviewed to suggest\n\nthat prison conditions gave the petitioner no alternative other than to protect himself with\n\na “preemptive strike” by murdering the victim.\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner testified on his own behalf at the hearing. He wanted\n\nto testify at the trial and at the sentencing hearing, however, Appman convinced him that\n\ntestifying would not be in his best interest based on his past convictions. In addition to the\n\ninformation given by Blair about his personal history, the petitioner testified at the hearing\n\nthat he loved his father, although his father’s mental illness made him unreliable at times.\n\nHis father would sometimes make the petitioner believe that his birth was a factor in his\n\nparents’ divorce. In attempting to get his father’s attention, the petitioner tried to excel in\n\nsports, however, his father did not attend many sporting events. When his father would\n\nreturn home from the psychiatric hospital, the petitioner would see an improvement.\n\nHowever, soon the pattern of behavior would repeat itself, and his father would return to\n\nthe hospital. Because of his father’s inconsistent presence in his life, the petitioner felt\n\ninsecure.\n\n\n\n              The petitioner’s paternal grandmother was the only stable individual in his life.\n\nHe knew that his grandmother would provide for him. When he was young, the petitioner\n\n\n\n                                              25\n\ffelt like a burden to his grandmother. She did not display emotion or physical affection,\n\nand he felt unloved. As a teenager, the petitioner had no supervision.\n\n\n\n              At the age of 15, the petitioner was deeply impacted by the death of his\n\nfather. All hope that his father would become well and share a normal relationship with him\n\nwas taken away. His grandmother gave him a car at the age of 16, and this increased his\n\naccess to drugs and to people with similar interests. The petitioner turned heavily to drugs\n\nand alcohol to deal with the hurt over his father’s death, and he lost interest in school and\n\nsports. His drug use became heavier, and he started selling drugs. Drug dealing\n\ndominated his life and pulled him away from his old friends. By the time he was 18, the\n\npetitioner had a cocaine habit. In the Fall of 1979, the petitioner moved back to Morristown\n\nto live with his grandmother. He admitted that during this time, he was doing more drugs\n\nthan any other time in his life.\n\n\n\n              At the post-conviction hearing, the petitioner admitted that he killed his\n\ngrandmother and that he had lied about it at the trial. At the time, lying made it easier to\n\naccept his grandmother’s death and his involvement. Moreover, he had not wanted to\n\naccept punishment.      When interviewed by Blair, the petitioner lied about killing his\n\ngrandmother.\n\n\n\n              As to the circumstances of Estep’s murder, the petitioner testified that he and\n\nFreeman bought a $50 bag of marijuana from Estep. The marijuana was low quality, so\n\nthe petitioner took it back and demanded his money. Estep, who was insulting, would not\n\nreturn the money. At a later time, Freeman and the petitioner went to Estep’s room to\n\ndemand the money. The petitioner threw the marijuana on Estep’s bed and asked for the\n\nmoney. There was a fight, and the petitioner took Estep’s watch, saying that he would get\n\nit back when he gave them the $50. Later that day, the petitioner received word that Estep\n\nwas intending to kill him and was making open threats. While the petitioner sent Estep\n\nseveral messages saying that he wanted to drop the matter, it was to no avail. In order to\n\nprotect himself, the petitioner obtained a knife. In the dining hall, the petitioner saw that\n\n\n\n                                             26\n\fEstep had a knife in his hands under his dinner tray. The petitioner stood up and Estep\n\nwalked to the opposite side of the room. This incident lead the petitioner to believe that\n\nEstep was serious about killing him, however, he did not check himself into protective\n\ncustody because he would have lost his privileges and it would have given him a reputation\n\nas someone who could not handle his own problems.\n\n\n\n              On the day of the murder, the petitioner and Freeman entered Guild 5 as\n\nsoon as the officer left. The petitioner testified that Street was not involved. Only two or\n\nthree inmates were sitting at a table in the back of the guild. The petitioner went into\n\nEstep’s room, and Freeman kept watch outside the cell. The petitioner had placed a\n\nmagazine underneath his shirt with an ace bandage wrapped around it as body armor, and\n\nhis knife was in his waistband. The petitioner made one last attempt at making peace, but\n\nEstep threw coffee in his face. After that, there was a struggle. When the petitioner was\n\nable to free himself, he got out the knife and began stabbing Estep. Eventually, the\n\npetitioner called Freeman for help. Freeman came into the cell and helped the petitioner\n\nstab Estep. When Estep finally quit struggling, the petitioner washed the knives in the toilet\n\nand put them under the bed. He then washed his face, and the two left. The petitioner\n\nwent to his room, took off his clothes, and placed them in a garbage bag, which he placed\n\nnear the front door for pick up. He then took a shower to wash off the blood. The\n\npetitioner claimed that he killed Estep in self defense.\n\n\n\n              In reviewing the “quality of the proposed testimony,” see Henley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060938\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060938/henley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582, it would have been proper proof at a sentencing hearing. As in Henley, however,\n\nthe evidence does not reveal a “disadvantaged background,” nor does it suggest\n\n“emotional and mental problems [that make the defendant] less culpable than defendants\n\nwho have no such excuse.” See Brown, 479 U.S. at 544, 107 S. Ct. at 841. As noted\n\nabove, the asserted mitigating factor in Goad was a recognized mental illness, whereas\n\nin the present case, the clinical psychologist diagnosed the petitioner with a personality\n\ndisorder.

Specifically, by delving into the petitioner’s background, defense counsel\n\nwould have necessarily had to consider the daunting prospect that such proposed\n\nevidence would have invited cross-examination or rebuttal to show the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the two murders committed in North Carolina and the murder of his\n\ngrandmother. The petitioner’s grandmother, who was a school teacher, had adopted and\n\nraised the petitioner, provided for his material needs, and protected him from his father’s\n\npsychotic outbursts of violence. It was when the grandmother discovered the prior murders\n\nthat the petitioner beat her to death. See Rickman v. Bell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749395\"><a href=\"/opinion/749395/ronald-eugene-rickman-petitioner-appelleecross-appellant-v-ricky-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1157 (6th Cir.\n\n1997) (finding deficient counsel’s performance where he “succeeded in creating a\n\nloathsome image for Rickman -- one that would make a juror feel compelled to rid the world\n\nof him”).\n\n\n\n              As to the second factor offered in Goad, whether evidence similar to the\n\nproposed evidence had already been heard by the jury, Appman presented proof of the\n\n\n\n                                             28\n\fprison conditions throughout the trial and the sentencing hearing. Also, proof of the\n\npetitioner having a relationship with normal, law-abiding citizens was shown through the\n\ntestimony of the Burchetts. However, no proof regarding the petitioner’s personal and\n\nfamily background or history was presented at the sentencing hearing.                Again, as\n\npreviously stated, such proof would have potentially opened the door to quite damaging\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n              The third Goad factor, the competing strength of the aggravating factors,\n\nfurther illustrates that any deficient performance was not prejudicial. See Henley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060938\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060938/henley-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 582. Here, the jury found three aggravating circumstances which were\n\nsupported by the proof. Specifically, the jury found that the petitioner had a prior conviction\n\nfor a felony involving violence, T.C.A. § 39-2-203(I)(2) (repealed 1989), which is an\n\naggravating circumstance that is “more qualitatively persuasive and objectively reliable than\n\nothers.” State v.

In the present case, the\n\nstate chose to only present proof of one of the petitioner’s three prior murder convictions\n\nto support this aggravating circumstance.           Moreover, the other two aggravating\n\ncircumstances, the murder was committed while the petitioner was in lawful custody and\n\nthe murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, T.C.A. § 39-2-203(i)(5) and (8) (repealed\n\n1989), are supported by the proof. See State v.

As pointed out by the post-conviction court, the proof showed that the petitioner\n\nrefused to assert “mental disease or defect or any diminished capacity as either a defense\n\nor in mitigation of the crime or the punishment.” The petitioner testified at the post-\n\nconviction hearing that he told Appman he did not want to pursue a mental defense.\n\nMoreover, the testimony of both clinical psychologists confirmed that the petitioner was not\n\nsuffering from a mental disease or defect at the time of the offense or the trial. Further, as\n\npointed out by the post-conviction court, if a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist had\n\ntestified, there would have been a distinct probability that the expert would have been\n\ncross-examined about the details of the petitioner’s prior episodes of violence, consisting\n\nof at least three prior homicides, including the murder of his grandmother. Counsel was\n\ngiven the opportunity to have his client evaluated by the state facility, however, he declined\n\nthis invitation because of fear that the state would use the unfavorable information\n\nregarding the petitioner’s past. Based on these facts, we cannot find that the petitioner\n\nwas prejudiced by counsel’s failure to pursue a psychological evaluation.

The\n\npetitioner contends that if counsel had done the necessary investigation, preparation, and\n\npresentation of a coherent mitigation case, he would have been able to present an opening\n\nargument and a coherent closing argument. Initially, this Court notes that a review of the\n\nrecord reveals that defense counsel did in fact present an opening statement at the\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n\n\n              Regarding counsel’s opening argument at the sentencing hearing, the post-\n\nconviction court held:\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       The petitioner suggests that the opening statement, consisting of only two\n       pages, was insufficient and he speculates that a more adequate statement\n       may have produced a different result. There is simply inadequate proof of\n       that proposition. By this time, the jury had heard a great deal of evidence\n       about the crime. The defense theory was evident. The petitioner’s social\n       history and criminal record, in only 18 years outside of incarceration, was\n       atrocious. There were some very favorable character witnesses for the\n       petitioner. It was a reasonable tactic to limit the damaging effect of the\n       unfavorable circumstances. Much of the favorable evidence today, as shown\n       in the evidentiary hearing, shows the petitioner has matured since the time\n       of trial.\n\n\n\n              As to the quality of the closing argument at sentencing, the post-conviction\n\ncourt held:\n\n\n\n       The petitioner makes this claim with the view that his trial counsel could have\n       made a more cogent, compelling argument had he conducted more legal\n       and factual research. The evidentiary hearing did not, however, produce\n       evidence that supports that claim. There is no indication that the result\n       would have been different. Simply too much emphasis has been placed\n       upon trial counsel’s role in the sentencing hearing. The problem for the\n       petitioner in this stage of the trial was his prior criminal record which included\n       three prior murder convictions in addition to that of Carl Estep, and\n       confessions for two other, unresolved claims of murder. Even with additional\n       expert and mitigating witnesses, the petitioner has failed to show what could\n       have been said by his counsel to the jury that might have caused a different\n       sentence.\n\n\n\n              The Court finds that the evidence does not preponderate against the post-\n\nconviction court’s findings on this claim.

He points to the extraordinary burdens imposed on counsel\n\nduring the pre-trial discovery process and the fact that counsel virtually conducted no\n\nfactual or legal investigation of possible mitigation.\n\n\n\n              At the post-conviction hearing, Appman stated that although the trial court\n\noffered to appoint co-counsel, he deliberately refused the offer. A paralegal with his office\n\ndid extensive investigation on this case. Appman also testified that he worked with the\n\n                                              31\n\fattorneys representing the co-defendants. In denying relief on this claim, the post-\n\nconviction court held:\n\n\n\n       The petitioner had experienced trial counsel who demonstrated a dogged\n       work ethic in the preparations for this trial. That each of the codefendants\n       had two lawyers, all of whom cooperated with the petitioner’s counsel, is\n       further evidence that the petitioner was not prejudiced in any way. All\n       testimony suggested the efforts of trial counsel for the petitioner commanded\n       the respect of his colleagues, who looked upon him for guidance and\n       leadership.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner has failed to show that counsel was ineffective for failing to\n\nrequest co-counsel or that he was prejudiced by that decision. At the time of the trial,\n\nAppman had practiced law for several years, trying his first major murder case more than\n\n10 years prior to the petitioner’s trial. Appman had also tried several cases in Morgan\n\nCounty and was familiar with the area. In addition, Appman was assisted by his paralegal,\n\nand he worked with the attorneys representing the co-defendants. Judge Eblen, who\n\npresided over the trial, testified that Appman did not seem hindered by the lack of co-\n\ncounsel, nor did his defense strategy appear disjointed during the course of the trial.\n\nAccordingly, we find that the evidence does not preponderate against the trial court’s\n\nfinding on this issue.

Id. at 1310. The district court also held that the instruction was\n\nvague despite the inclusion of the term \"depravity of mind,\" which it also found to be\n\nunconstitutionally vague. Id. In contrast, the trial court in the present case instructed the\n\njury on all the definitions required under Williams, and counsel’s performance was not\n\ndeficient in failing to raise this issue.\n\n\n\n               Finally, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research and\n\ninvestigate, and to prepare proposed instructions at the guilt and sentencing phases based\n\non the federal findings and admitted conclusions of the state’s own experts on factual\n\nissues bearing directly on the petitioner’s assertion of self-defense, on statutory mitigating\n\ncircumstances, and on non-statutory mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n\n               As noted by the post-conviction court, a more extensive case could have\n\nbeen presented, however, this is not the standard in reviewing a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. Previously in this opinion, the Court found that the petitioner had\n\nnot met his burden of proving ineffective assistance based on counsel’s failure to present\n\nproof of prior federal proceedings on the issue of prison conditions. The same holds true\n\nfor counsel’s failure to request these jury instructions. This issue is without merit.\n\n\n\n                   (G) Failure to Object to Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n\n\n               The petitioner raises several claims that counsel was ineffective by failing to\n\nobject to misconduct by the prosecution. The post-conviction court held that the petitioner\n\nfailed to show any misconduct, and therefore, his claim of ineffective assistance was held\n\nto be without merit. While in some instances, the arguments made by the prosecution\n\nwere improper, we find that the petitioner has failed to show that he was prejudiced by\n\ncounsel’s failure to object to these remarks.\n\n\n\n               First, the petitioner submits that defense counsel failed to investigate or\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\fresearch, or to object at trial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s repeated\n\nmisstatements in voir dire that the conditions at MCRCF had no bearing on how the law\n\nshould be applied. While the petitioner cites to the record for the specific instances\n\ncomplained of, he has failed to cite to any authority supporting relief on this issue, and\n\ntherefore, the issue is deemed waived. See Rule 10, Tennessee Court of Criminal\n\nAppeals Rules.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to research or to\n\nobject at trial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s statements about Crafton’s\n\ncredibility, not only because such practice was improper generally, but because the\n\nprosecution’s argument was misleading to the extent that it implied that inmate Crafton’s\n\ntestimony about the dangerous conditions in TDOC was untrue. Specifically, the petitioner\n\ncomplains of two comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument at the guilt\n\nphase: “[Crafton] thinks he is a cut above the other prisoners, that he is a man of\n\ncharacter, a man of principle a man who wants to live decently and rightly” and “[a]re you\n\ngoing to buy the goods he is trying to sell to you?”\n\n\n\n              A prosecutor's argument must be supported by evidence introduced at trial\n\nand the reasonable inferences to be drawn from that evidence.

Crafton testified during cross-examination that he had never met\n\nanother inmate with his principles or character. As to the prosecutor’s question to the jury\n\nwhether it was going to “buy the goods he is trying to sell you,” the state also made clear\n\nthat it was the jury’s responsibility to judge the credibility of witnesses:\n\n\n\n              [Crafton] was here to give his viewpoints and his expert opinion on\n       prison life. The first thing I would like you to consider is was he credible to\n       you? Listen carefully when the Judge charges as to how to determine\n       someone’s credibility and the things that you are entitled to consider, such\n       as respectability, possible bias, whether they really know what they are\n       talking about in the first place.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the jury was charged by the trial court regarding the weight and credibility as\n\nto all witnesses. Even if the closing remarks of the prosecutor were improper, which we\n\ndo not find, we find that the petitioner has failed to demonstrate resulting prejudice.\n\n\n\n              In a similar complaint, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to\n\nobject at trial, post-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s argument “Are you willing for the\n\ncitizens of Morgan County to accept the kind of prison system that [Crafton] seems to think\n\nyou ought to have,” implying that the petitioner and Crafton were responsible for the\n\nsystem-wide violence. While the prosecutor’s argument was not supported by the proof,\n\nin that Crafton testified as to his impressions of actual prison conditions and not what\n\nprison conditions should be, the petitioner has failed to show that this argument was\n\nprejudicial.

Specifically, the prosecutor argued to the jury:\n\n\n\n              Now, use your common sense here for a moment. Who was locked\n       up immediately after this body was found and the very first information\n       received? They are sitting right over there. Do you think Mr. Worthington\n       said, “Oh, let’s see, we got a dead man here, lock up Street, Sutton and\n       Freeman.” Do any of you all believe that?\n\n\n\n              This argument was clearly inappropriate. A prosecutor should not imply that\n\na defendant is guilty because he is the one who was arrested. See State v.

Therefore, the petitioner has not shown\n\nprejudice due to counsel’s failure to object.\n\n\n\n              Next, the petitioner contends that defense counsel failed to object at trial,\n\npost-trial, or on appeal to the prosecution’s argument that “I have not heard one word of\n\nNick Sutton or Thomas Street ever being touched by Carl Estep. I heard a lot of\n\nsuggestion, but that is all it has been.” The petitioner contends that this argument\n\nconstituted an impermissible comment on his failure to testify. We disagree. The\n\nargument did not comment on the petitioner’s failure to testify. It was merely a comment\n\non the proof. There was testimony regarding possible threats made by the victim, but there\n\nwas no proof of the victim physically attacking or hurting the petitioner.

Specifically, the petitioner argues that an objection should have been\n\nmade to the following arguments made by the prosecution: “What are you going to do to\n\nNicholas Sutton, Give him a life sentence? Will that prevent there being another Carl\n\nEstep?,” “Society has certain rights and the State simply asks that you exercise society’s\n\nright to self-defense. These men are already locked up. Mr. Nicholas Sutton is already\n\nserving a life sentence,” “[Sutton] was conditioned on the street to kill people. Ladies and\n\ngentlemen, we suggest to you that persons who are armed robbers and first degree\n\nmurderers are already conditioned to kill people,” and “When we get to the point that we\n\nhave done everything possible to protect ourselves and there is nothing else we can\n\nreasonably do that would protect ourselves from people like Nicholas Todd Sutton...then\n\nwe have the right of self-defense and this is where capital punishment comes in.”\n\n\n\n              A capital sentencing jury is not precluded from consideration of the future\n\ndangerousness of a particular defendant where such is a relevant factor under a state's\n\ncapital sentencing law.

Based\n\non our review of the issues raised regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, we reject the\n\npetitioner’s contention that the cumulative effect of any errors found would require reversal.\n\n\n\n                                             40\n\f                    V. False Testimony and Misleading Argument\n                          Regarding Conditions at MCRCF\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that during the trial, the state falsely portrayed inmate\n\nsafety and security at MCRCF. On this issue, the post-conviction court held:\n\n\n\n       The petitioner has failed to meet his burden of proof. There is insufficient\n       evidence to establish that the state misrepresented the level of safety and\n       security for inmates at the Morgan County Regional Correctional Facility at\n       the time of the offense. There is no indication that the witness, James\n       Worthington, inappropriately misled the petitioner or his counsel in this\n       regard. Moreover, the petitioner was in a position to have known of these\n       circumstances, divulge them to his counsel, and supply possible witnesses\n       in support of his claims. For example, the petitioner presented a witness at\n       trial, Carl Crafton, who testified at length about prison life and the conditions\n       that existed in the Department of Corrections at the time of this offense.\n\n\n\n              At trial, Worthington testified regarding his perceptions of the prison\n\nenvironment at MCRCF. Proof that Worthington was aware of Wood’s report does not\n\nmake his testimony regarding his own perceptions of the prison conditions false. Cf.\n\nBrotherton v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523-24 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1971)(doctor’s opinion\n\ntestimony regarding whether defendant appeared sober is not made out to be perjury by\n\nresults of blood test reflecting alcohol content of .014 in defendant's blood).\n\n\n\n        VI. False Testimony Regarding Prior Statement of Inmate Lumbert\n\n\n\n              The petitioner contends that a handwritten memo regarding inmate Gary\n\nLumbert’s statement taken by Worthington was not included in the state’s files and was\n\nonly produced a few days prior to the post-conviction hearing. The petitioner submits that\n\nthe statement was manufactured, that it constituted false testimony, and that the testimony\n\nwas material to the proceedings. The petitioner further contends that the post-conviction\n\ncourt erred by failing to address this issue.\n\n\n\n              While it does not appear that the post-conviction court addressed this specific\n\nissue, we find that it is without merit. Worthington’s notebook contained notes from all the\n\n\n\n                                                41\n\finterviews conducted during the investigation of the murder, however, a memo regarding\n\nan interview of Lumbert on March 13, 1985, was not included in the notebook, nor was\n\nLumbert’s name included on the lists provided to defense counsel. Lumbert eventually\n\ntestified at trial on behalf of co-defendant Street. Before the post-conviction hearing, the\n\nmemo regarding the interview with Lumbert was found in Worthington’s miscellaneous file.\n\nWorthington testified that the statement was not in his notebook because it had been\n\nmisplaced.\n\n\n\n              Included in the state’s file were notes written by General Harvey during\n\nLumbert’s testimony at trial. According to General Harvey, Worthington was telling the\n\nprosecutors that Lumbert had given different answers during his interview that were\n\ncontrary to his testimony. General Harvey took notes so they could look into the matter.\n\nThe notes indicated that Lumbert had told W orthington that Freeman and Street were\n\nbragging about the murder, however, the memo regarding an interview of Lumbert\n\nindicated that Lumbert had stated that the petitioner and Street were the ones bragging\n\nabout the murder. General Harvey did not know if he had misinterpreted what Worthington\n\nwas saying or if Worthington had misspoken at the time.\n\n\n\n              A review of the trial transcript also refutes the petitioner’s claim. When\n\nWorthington was cross-examined by defense counsel, he indicated that inmate Lumbert’s\n\nstatement had been recorded and the trial court ordered the state to produce that\n\nstatement for the purposes of cross-examination. Accordingly, defense counsel was given\n\nan opportunity to review the statement at the time of the trial. This supports a finding that\n\nthe statement was available and reviewed at the time of trial and was not falsely\n\nmanufactured for purposes of the post-conviction hearing.\n\n\n\n                              VII.

Specifically, the petitioner submits that\n\nthe proof showed that prior to trial, the state was in possession of inconsistent statements\n\nof the four inmate witnesses who testified for the state and the statements of those four\n\ninmates that conflicted directly. The petitioner further submits that the proof showed that\n\nthe state was aware of the findings in Wood’s report on MCRCF, that the information was\n\nnot provided to defense counsel, and that Worthington’s testimony at trial directly conflicted\n\nwith Wood’s findings and conclusions.\n\n\n\n              On the petitioner’s Brady claims, the post-conviction court held that the\n\npetitioner failed to rebut the statutory presumption of waiver and, in the alternative, failed\n\nto meet his burden of proof to establish that the state violated any of the discovery\n\nguidelines which would qualify him for relief. As to the petitioner’s Giglio claim, the post-\n\nconviction court held that he “failed to meet his burden of proof to establish any violation\n\nof the Giglio rule. The proof simply does not establish that the state made any promises\n\nof immunity or leniency to the witnesses in exchange for testimony. There was no\n\nevidence that the prosecution withheld any documents or information of any kind that\n\nwould tend to impeach the credibility of the state’s witnesses.”\n\n\n\n              In Brady v.

However, a review of the\n\nrecord confirms the post-conviction court’s finding that the petitioner failed to show that any\n\nfavors or immunity were given to any of the witnesses in exchange for their testimony.\n\nWorthington and the assistant district attorney generals who prosecuted the petitioner’s\n\n\n\n                                              44\n\fcase testified that at the beginning, they agreed that there would be no promises to\n\ninmates in exchange for testimony. Worthington believed that all the inmates who testified\n\nhad already been paroled at the time of the trial with the exception of Scates. After the\n\ntrial, as a courtesy, he wrote Scates a letter of appreciation for his testimony. At best, the\n\nproof showed that the state offered to protect any inmates willing to testify from possible\n\nretaliation.\n\n\n\n               The petitioner submits that the state should have provided the statements of\n\nthe four inmates who testified at trial because the statements were inconsistent. The\n\nstatements of the four inmates were suppressed by the state before trial, however, the\n\ndefense received the statements as Jencks material after each inmate testified and before\n\ncross-examination.\n\n\n\n               In State v.

Moreover, the trial court gave defense\n\ncounsel ample opportunity to review the statements before cross-examining each witness.\n\nThereafter, defense counsel was given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses and\n\npoint out any inconsistencies in their statements and testimony.

Regardless, our\n\nSupreme Court has held repeatedly that the death penalty statutes are constitutional.\n\n\n\n              Initially, the petitioner contends that the death penalty statutes fail to\n\nmeaningfully narrow the class of death eligible defendants. Specifically, he argues that the\n\naggravating circumstance set forth in T.C.A. § 39-2-204(i)(5) (repealed 1989), that the\n\nmurder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel, is vague and overbroad.

Specifically, the petitioner contends that the\n\nappellate review process is not constitutionally meaningful because the appellate courts\n\ncannot reweigh proof due to the absence of written findings concerning mitigating\n\ncircumstances, because the information relied upon by the appellate courts is inadequate\n\nand incomplete, and because the appellate courts’ methodology is flawed.                 These\n\narguments have all been rejected. See State v. Brimmer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87-88; State v.\n\nCazes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2384392\"><a href=\"/opinion/2384392/state-v-cazes/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 270-71 (Tenn. 1994).\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner contends that the statutorily mandated proportionality\n\n\n\n                                              47\n\freview is conducted in violation of due process. Our Supreme Court has held that the\n\nappellate review provided for in the statute affords a meaningful proportionality review.\n\nSee State v. Brimmer, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">876</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87-88; State v.

In State v. Branam, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1668982\"><a href=\"/opinion/1668982/state-v-branam/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">563</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Tenn. 1993), the Supreme Court found the death penalty to be disproportionate and\n\nreduced the defendant's sentence to life. Id. at 570-71. The petitioner’s claims regarding\n\nthe constitutionality of the death penalty statutes are waived, previously determined, and\n\nwithout merit.\n\n\n\n                 IX. Imposition of Death Penalty Arbitrary and Capricious\n\n\n\n              Finally, the petitioner contends that because the state failed to provide safe\n\nand constitutional conditions in prison at the time of the murder, imposition of the death\n\npenalty would be arbitrary, capricious, and fundamentally unfair. This issue was previously\n\ndetermined by our Supreme Court on direct appeal. The Court held that “imposition of the\n\ndeath penalty by the jury was neither arbitrary nor excessive or disproportionate to the\n\npenalty imposed for similar crimes.” State v.

Conclusion\n\n\n\n              After thoroughly reviewing the record and the law applicable to the issues\n\nraised in this appeal, we find that the petitioner has failed to prove his allegations by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.
