The principal issue is whether either the Property\nSettlement Agreement (“PSA”) entered by the Superior Court of New\n\n       *\n         The Honorable Louis H. Pollak, United States District Judge\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.\n\n                                 2\n\fJersey, Chancery Division: Family Part, Ocean County (“New Jersey\nCourt”), prior to the ex-husband’s death, or an order nunc pro tunc\nobtained from that same court subsequent to the ex-husband’s death,\nconstitutes a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (“QDRO”) pursuant\nto the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”),\nas amended by the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (“REA”), see 29\nU.S.C. § 1056(d)(3). The District Court, in reliance on its broad\nreading of our opinion in Samaroo v. Samaroo, 193 F.3d 185 (3d Cir.\n1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1062 (2000), granted the Pension Plan’s\nmotion for summary judgment, concluding that the order nunc pro\ntunc could not create a right to survivorship benefits after the ex-\nhusband’s death. As to the PSA entered before the ex-husband’s\ndeath, the District Court concluded that it did not meet the statutory\nQDRO requirements and that any attempt to qualify that order as a\nQDRO after his death to provide the ex-wife with survivorship\nbenefits was improper under Samaroo. Because we conclude that the\nPSA constituted a QDRO pursuant to the process contemplated\nwithin 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3), providing the ex-wife with a separate\ninterest in the pension benefit prior to her ex-husband’s death, we will\nreverse the District Court’s order and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I. Facts\n\n        Rita Files (“Files”) married Ed Rutyna (“Rutyna”) in\nNovember 1972. Rutyna worked for ExxonMobil from September\n5, 1972 to April 7, 1993, and participated in two ERISA-governed\nplans through ExxonMobil – the Pension Plan and a Savings Plan\n(formerly known as the Exxon Thrift Plan) (“Savings Plan”).1 When\nhe left ExxonMobil in 1993, Rutyna had a fully-vested pension\nentitlement. However, since he was under fifty years of age, he was\n\n       1\n         The Pension Plan and Savings Plan, although distinct benefit\nplans, share the same administration.\n\n                                   3\n\fnot yet eligible to receive his pension; the earliest he would become\neligible would be September of 1996, on reaching fifty.\n\n        Nearly two years after Rutyna could begin receiving pension\nbenefits, Rutyna and Files agreed to the PSA, which was incorporated\ninto the Dual Judgment of Divorce entered by the New Jersey Court\non July 16, 1998. Paragraph 3.2 of the PSA, provided in relevant\npart:\n\n       The Husband is the owner of an Exxon pension and\n       Exxon . . . [Savings] Account and a TOSCO pension.\n       Wife hereby waives, now and forever, any right, title\n       or claim on the Husband’s TOSCO pension funds.\n       The wife shall be entitled to one-half of the Exxon\n       pension and one-half of the Exxon . . . [Savings]\n       Account. The transfer shall be by QDRO [“qualified\n       domestic relations order”] as to the pension and by\n       transfer to an account designated by the wife as to the\n       . . . [Savings] Account.\n\n        After the PSA was entered by the New Jersey Court, Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel, by letter dated August 16, 2000, advised the\nExxonMobil Benefits Administrative Office (“Benefits\nAdministrator”) of the divorce and requested a sample QDRO “in\norder to distribute his Pension and . . . [Savings] fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the divorce.”2 The Benefits Administrator\n\n       2\n        Because of the importance of the statutory scheme to an\nunderstanding of the parties’ respective positions regarding whether\nthe PSA meets the statutory requirements for a QDRO, we set forth\nthe relevant statutory provisions throughout our factual recitation.\nERISA’s anti-alienation provision states that “[e]ach pension plan\nshall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be\n\n                                  4\n\fresponded, by letter dated September 16, 2000, that Rutyna’s written\nauthorization was required for the release of information. By letter\ndated September 18, 2000, Rutyna’s divorce counsel provided\nRutyna’s authorization for the release of information to distribute his\npension and savings accounts in accordance with the terms of the\nPSA. The Benefits Administrator then provided, by letter dated\nSeptember 29, 2000, a Pension Plan estimate, a statement of account\nfor the Savings Plan as of September 27, 2000, a package of materials\nexplaining the Pension Plan’s QDRO policies and practices, and a\nsample QDRO. An enclosed Q & A sheet entitled “Information\nAbout Thrift and Annuity Plan Benefits as Part of the Divorce\nProcess” stated that –\n\n\nassigned or alienated.” 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1). The REA amended\nthat anti-alienation provision by setting forth a process to give effect\nto divorce decrees and state-court orders that pertain to ERISA\nregulated plans if the order is determined to be a QDRO. See Boggs\nv. Boggs, 520 U.S. 833, 847 (1997); McGowan v. NJR Service Corp.,\n423 F.3d 241, 249 (3d Cir. 2005); 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(A).\n“QDRO” is defined as a “domestic relations order . . . which creates\nor recognizes the existence of an alternate payee’s right to, or assigns\nto an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the\nbenefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan,” and\nwhich meets certain statutory requirements, which are set forth in 29\nU.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(C)(i)-(iv). 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(B)(i); see\ninfra at n.7. “[D]omestic relations order means any judgment, decree,\nor order . . . which . . . relates to the provision of . . . marital property\nrights . . . made pursuant to a State domestic relations law. . . .” 29\nU.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii). An “alternate payee’ is “any spouse,\nformer spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is\nrecognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive\nall, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to\nsuch participant.” 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(K).\n\n                                     5\n\f      Once Exxon’s Benefits Accounting or Benefits\n      Administration Office receives written notice of a\n      divorce (either pending or final), . . . [Savings] and . . .\n      [Pension] Plan benefits will generally be ‘blocked.’\n      If benefits are blocked, the participant may not receive\n      them until one of the documents noted below [e.g. a\n      divorce decree or a QDRO] is provided or 18 months\n      has passed from the time the participant could first\n      receive the benefits.3\n\n      3\n       This 18-month block is consistent with the process\ncontemplated by ERISA § 206(d)(3)(H)(i)-(v), 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(i)-(v), which provides:\n\n      (i) During any period in which the issue of whether a\n      domestic relations order is a qualified domestic\n      relations order is being determined (by the plan\n      administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or\n      otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately\n      account for the amounts . . . which would have been\n      payable to the alternate payee during such period if\n      the order had been determined to be a qualified\n      domestic relations order.\n      (ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause\n      (v) the order ... is determined to be a . . . [QDRO], the\n      plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts\n      (including any interest thereon) to the person or\n      persons entitled thereto.\n      (iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause\n      (v) -\n                (I) it is determined that the order is not\n                a . . . [QDRO], or\n                (II) the issue as to whether such order\n\n                                   6\n\fIndeed, following receipt of the August 16, 2000 letter from Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel, the administrator blocked Rutyna’s savings account.4\n\n\n               is a qualified domestic relations order\n               is not resolved,\n       then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated\n       amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person\n       or persons who would have been entitled to such\n       amounts if there had been no order.\n       (iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified\n       domestic relations order which is made after the close\n       of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be\n       applied prospectively only.\n       (v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month\n       period described in this clause is the 18-month period\n       beginning with the date on which the first payment\n       would be required to be made under the domestic\n       relations order.\n       4\n         When questioned as to whether that block also applied to the\npension account, Rodney Leis, testifying as the Pension Plan’s\ndesignee pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure, confirmed that, consistent with ERISA, 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(i)-(v), a pension account generally would be blocked\nfor retirees once the Plan “knew that somebody’s in the process of\ndivorce.” As to terminees (which is what Rutyna was), Leis testified\n“so the general question would we put a block on the pension plan,\nif we know that there was an imminent retirement and they also had\nthe divorce, I certainly hope that our organization put a block on both\nof them [the savings and the pension plans].” A. 183. He further\ncharacterized this as “an administration procedure that we didn’t send\nmoney to the wrong parties.” Id. Although Files contends that the\nExxonMobil Human Resources Department confirmed, in\n\n                                  7\n\fBut, Rutyna’s divorce counsel never provided the QDRO information\nreceived from the Pension Plan to either Files or her counsel. When\nRutyna died on February 25, 2001 at age 54, no QDRO had been\nsubmitted to the Pension Plan.\n\n        After Rutyna’s death, a letter exchange ensued between Files\nand the Benefits Administrator setting forth their respective positions\nregarding Files’s entitlement to benefits under each Plan pursuant to\nthe PSA. Three (3) days after Rutyna’s death, Files’s divorce counsel\nnotified Exxon’s legal department of the death, acknowledged that no\nQDRO had been filed, and inquired whether the Pension Plan would\nhonor the PSA. Files herself also notified the Plans of Rutyna’s death\nin her capacity as executrix of his estate. The Benefits Administrator\nreplied to Files by letter dated March 14, 2001, seeking a death\ncertificate and stating unequivocally that as to the Pension Plan “there\nare no survivor benefits due and payable.”5 Files’s new counsel (also\n\n\ncorrespondence to Rutyna’s divorce counsel dated August 29, 2000,\nthat a block was placed on both the savings and pension accounts, the\nPension Plan clarified in its correspondence of October 24, 2001 to\nFiles’s counsel that the block pertained only to the savings account.\nConsequently, whether the block also pertained to the pension\naccount is subject to dispute.\n        5\n         From the outset, the Plan characterized the pension benefits\nsought by Files as “survivor benefits,” which are explicitly provided\nfor within ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. § 1055. 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(F)\nprovides that to the extent provided for in a QDRO, a former spouse\nof a plan participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse for\npurposes of § 1055 (providing for mandatory plan provisions\nregarding joint and survivor annuity and pre-retirement survivor\nannuity provisions). ERISA, however, does not insist that a state\ncourt recognize a former spouse as an alternate payee to such an\n\n                                   8\n\fher counsel in this appeal), then wrote to the Plans on March 31,\n2001, requesting summary plan documents and asking that no\ndistribution be made until he could determine whether the PSA met\nthe QDRO requirements for each Plan. A week later, by letter dated\nApril 6, 2001, Files’s counsel wrote another letter, enclosing the PSA,\nexplaining Files’s position that the PSA was a QDRO as to both the\nSavings and Pension Plans, and requesting distribution of benefits\npursuant to both Plans. But, that letter characterized the pension\nbenefit sought as a fifty percent “survivor benefit” under the Pension\nPlan and requested forms to allow Files to “elect commencement of\nher surviving spouse benefit.”6\n\n        The administrator of both the Savings and the Pension Plans,\nby letter of July 18, 2001, denied Files’s claim for benefits pursuant\nto the PSA, indicating within its determination that: (1) the PSA\n\n\ninterest in her spouse’s pension, but merely yields to the prerogative\nof state law to do so. See Critchell v. Critchell, 746 A.2d 282, 286\n(D.C. Cir. 2000). Nor does ERISA limit the plan benefits that may\nbe addressed within state court domestic relations orders to “survivor\nbenefits.” Accordingly, the Plan’s characterization of the benefits\nFiles seeks as “survivor benefits” does not control our determination\nof whether the domestic relations orders in question constitute\nQDROs.\n       6\n          We note that the imprecision in characterizing Files’s claim\nfor pension benefits as one for a “fifty percent survivorship benefit”\nin light of the Plans March 14, 2001 correspondence stating that as to\nthe Pension Plan there were no “survivor benefits due and payable”\nonly served to confuse this already difficult record as to the benefit\nthat Files actually sought. That imprecision, however, was later\nclarified by Files’s counsel when describing her claim as one for a\n“separate interest” in fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension benefits.\n\n                                  9\n\fwould be treated as a QDRO for purposes of the Savings Plan (and\nspecifically that Files would get one-half of that account and, because\nof the lack of a beneficiary designation, Rutyna’s children would get\nthe remainder); (2) the PSA would not be treated as a QDRO for\npurposes of the Pension Plan; and (3) the absence of an award of\n“survivor benefits to Alternate Payee” in the PSA, coupled with\nRutyna’s death before either Files or Rutyna commenced their receipt\nof Pension Plan benefits, resulted in no benefits payable to Files as an\n“Alternate Payee” because the PSA did not award her surviving\nspouse benefits.7 That letter also stated that the Pension Plan would\n\n       7\n          The Pension Plan based its denial of QDRO status to the PSA\nas regards the pension on the following statutory provisions. A\ndomestic relations order is a QDRO “only if such order clearly\nspecifies . . . (i) the name and last known mailing address . . . of the\nparticipant and . . . of each alternate payee covered by the order,\n(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant’s benefits to be paid\nby the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such\namount or percentage is to be determined, (iii) the number of\npayments or period to which such order applies, and (iv) each plan to\nwhich such order applies,” (29 U.S.C. § 1056 (d)(3)(C)(i)-(iv)) and\n“only if such order –\n\n       (i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form\n       of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided\n       under the plan,\n       (ii) does not require a plan to provide increased\n       benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value),\n       and\n       (iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an\n       alternate payee which are required to be paid to\n       another alternate payee under another order previously\n       determined to be a . . . [QDRO].”\n\n                                  10\n\fnot entertain a nunc pro tunc order with respect to the Pension Plan\nsurvivor benefits as that would violate 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D) by\nrequiring the Pension Plan to pay increased benefits. The Pension\nPlan’s position is premised on its determination that Rutyna’s pension\nbenefits lapsed upon his death in the absence of any designated\nsurvivor annuity; consequently, any state court DRO providing for\npayment of pension benefits to an alternate payee that was presented\nto the Pension Plan subsequent to Rutyna’s death would, in the\nPension Plan’s opinion, result in the Pension Plan having to provide\nincreased benefits in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D)(ii).\n\n        By letter dated August 9, 2001, Files’s counsel appealed\nadministratively the Pension Plan’s denial of Files’s claim for pension\nbenefits pursuant to the PSA. In that letter, Files’s counsel stated that\nit was his understanding, based on the block placed on the savings\naccount, that the Pension Plan was on notice of the divorce\nproceedings prior to Rutyna’s death. He further explained that Files\nwas seeking to enforce an interest created by the PSA during\nRutyna’s lifetime, entitling her to fifty percent of Rutyna’s accrued\nbenefits, which was enforceable by Files in her own right regardless\nof Rutyna’s death because that interest was not a surviving spouse\nbenefit. Files’s counsel also enclosed with that letter “a proposed\nform of separate interest QDRO” and inquired whether it would\nqualify as a QDRO for Pension Plan purposes upon its entry by the\nNew Jersey Court. The letter explained: “It should be evident from\nthe interest thereby created that Ms. Files[’s] benefit is neither a\nsurvivor benefit nor a benefit that would increase the Plan’s cost . . .\n[A]s structured the benefit would have been removed from Mr.\nRutyna’s interest effective as of the date of the...[PSA].”\n\n\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D)(i)-(iii).\n\n                                   11\n\f        The Pension Plan again denied Files’s claim for benefits\npursuant to the PSA on October 24, 2001. First, the Pension Plan\nclarified that a block had been placed only on Rutyna’s savings\naccount, not on his pension account. Next, the Pension Plan quoted\nextensively from its Summary Plan Description to support its denial\n– “if a terminee [which is what Rutyna was8] dies before a vested\npension benefit payment begins and without a surviving spouse no\nbenefit is payable.” The Pension Plan concluded as follows:\n\n       We have reviewed the 1998 PSA and have determined\n       that it does not specifically state that Ms. Files shall\n       be considered a surviving spouse. Survivor benefits\n       are fixed as of the participant’s death and the\n       proposed DRO . . . would expand the liability of the\n       Plan. Your argument that a separate interest DRO\n       would have given Ms. Files survivor rights is well\n       taken but there is no assurance that a separate interest\n       DRO is what would have been agreed to by the\n       parties. Therefore, we cannot qualify the . . .\n       [proposed DRO] as a QDRO at this time as no\n       pension benefits are payable in accordance with . . .\n       the Plan.\n\nFiles’s counsel replied with yet another appeal dated December 17,\n2001, again requesting pension benefits pursuant to the PSA. He\nexplained that a QDRO was entered within the eighteen month\nsegregation period following notice to the Plan of the divorce\nproceedings. The letter continued that because Files was granted a\nseparate interest enforceable under state law effective upon entry of\n\n       8\n        The Summary Plan Description for the Pension Plan defines\n“terminee” as a “person who separates from service without\nbecoming a retiree.”\n\n                                 12\n\fthe PSA, after entry of the QDRO, that interest must be paid to her\nupon her request following Rutyna’s earliest retirement age under the\nPension Plan.\n\n       In light of the Pension Plan’s continued denial of Files’s claim\npursuant to the terms of the PSA, upon Files’s request, the New\nJersey Court entered a subsequent order dated February 7, 2002,\nproviding:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, the Court does hereby enter\n       this Order nunc pro tunc from the date of the . . .\n       [PSA], July 16, 1998, as and for a Qualified Domestic\n       Relations Order [QDRO] within the meaning of . . .\n       Section 206(d) of . . . [ERISA], for the express\n       purpose of enabling . . . [Files] to compel the . . .\n       [Pension Plan] to make payment to her of her property\n       entitlement under state law in accordance with the\n       Domestic Relations Order embodied in this Court’s\n       Dual Judgment of Divorce entered on July 16, 1998.\n\n(hereinafter, “Order nunc pro tunc”). By letter dated February 28,\n2002, a copy of this Order nunc pro tunc was forwarded to the\nPension Plan, which it forwarded to its consultants for review. On\nMay 30, 2002, the Pension Plan informed Files that, given the entry\nof the Order nunc pro tunc, it was no longer considering whether the\nPSA would qualify as a QDRO. By letter dated October 7, 2002, the\nPension Plan’s consultants denied Files’s claim for benefits pursuant\nto the Order nunc pro tunc explaining:\n\n       [The Pension Plan] will not qualify an order\n       pertaining to the [Pension Plan] that is first submitted\n       to the Plan and entered by the Court after a\n       participant’s date of death. On the date of [Rutyna’s]\n\n\n                                  13\n\f       death, he was not married, and the Plan did not have\n       a QDRO on file pertaining to his benefit. Therefore\n       in accordance with the terms of the Plan, no further\n       benefit is payable to any party.\n\n                       II. Procedural History\n\n        Files initiated this action by filing a four count complaint in\nthe United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In\nCount I, against the Pension Plan and its Administrator, she requested\nbenefits and alleged a breach of fiduciary duty claim related to the\nPension Plan’s failure and refusal to pay her benefits in accordance\nwith the PSA or the Order nunc pro tunc. In Counts II through IV,\nshe alleged legal malpractice against both her own and Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel, alleging that counsel had failed to effectuate the\ntransfer of her interest in the Pension Plan benefits by (1) failing to\nprepare the PSA in a form that would be enforced by the Pension\nPlan; (2) failing to prepare a QDRO prior to Rutyna’s death in a form\nthat would be enforced by the Pension Plan; and (3) failing to obtain\nthe Pension Plan’s approval of either the PSA or another domestic\nrelations order as a QDRO prior to Rutyna’s death.\n\n       On cross-motions for summary judgment regarding Count I\nof the Complaint, the District Court denied Files’s motion and\ngranted the Pension Plan’s.9 At the outset, the District Court\ncharacterized Files’s position as not seeking a survivorship benefit\nthrough her separate interest QDRO obtained by the Order nunc pro\n\n       9\n        Although the District Court continued to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the legal malpractice claims, a consent\njudgment was entered later against Rutyna’s divorce counsel, and the\nremaining counsel defendants were dismissed, with the District Court\nretaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the consent judgment.\n\n                                  14\n\ftunc, but instead as seeking to be paid the separate property interest\nawarded to her by the terms of the PSA. The Pension Plan argued\nthat Files sought a property interest not provided for by law and was\nnot entitled to survivorship benefits pursuant to ERISA in light of her\ncounsel’s failure to file the QDRO with the Pension Plan prior to\nRutyna’s death. The District Court agreed with the Pension Plan.\n\n        The District Court first determined that despite Files’s\nassertion, the PSA did not meet the requirements of a QDRO. In the\ncourse of its reasoning, the District Court determined that Rutyna\ncould not assign or alienate his benefits except through a QDRO\npursuant to the REA, which amended ERISA’s anti-alienation\nprovision. 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(A).10 Next, the District Court\ndetermined that the PSA failed to meet the statutory requirements of\na QDRO as set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(B)-(D). Specifically,\nthe District Court determined that the PSA failed to name Files as an\n\n       10\n            That provision provides:\n\n       (d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits\n       (1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits\n       provided under the plan may not be assigned or\n       alienated.\n               *      *       *\n       (3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation,\n       assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit\n       payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a\n       domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1)\n       shall not apply if the order is determined to be a\n       qualified domestic relations order [QDRO]. Each\n       pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits\n       in accordance with the applicable requirements of any\n       qualified domestic relations order.\n\n                                  15\n\f“alternate payee” as required by § 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I); did not detail\nthe number of payments or pay period as required by\n§ 1056(d)(3)(C)(iii); would require the Pension Plan to provide\nincreased benefits as prohibited by § 1056(d)(3)(D)(ii); and did not\ndesignate Files as a surviving spouse as permitted by § 1056(d)(3)(F).\n\n        Relying on our decision in Samaroo, the District Court then\naffirmed the Pension Plan’s refusal to honor the Order nunc pro tunc.\nThe District Court characterized our holding in Samaroo as “where\na PSA or divorce judgment does not create a survivorship right to\npension benefits, a QDRO entered after the death of the plan\nparticipant also cannot do so,” and further explained that per our\nSamaroo holding, the Order nunc pro tunc was not a QDRO because\nit violated the prohibition against requiring the Pension Plan to\nprovide increased benefits “by providing for a survivorship interest\nin benefits that had lapsed after the participant’s death.” Accordingly,\nthe District Court concluded that because it was undisputed that a\nQDRO was never filed with the Pension Plan and that Rutyna’s\nbenefits lapsed upon his death, any attempt by Files to obtain a nunc\npro tunc amendment to the PSA must fail.\n\n        Second, the District Court rejected Files’s argument that the\nOrder nunc pro tunc was a “separate interest QDRO” which did not\ncreate survivorship interests, but rather reaffirmed that the PSA had\ngranted Files a fifty percent property interest in Rutyna’s pension that\ndid not lapse upon his death.11 The District Court viewed Files’s\n\n       11\n         As explained more fully within, we understand Files to be\nasserting that the PSA created her separate interest in Rutyna’s\npension at the time the PSA was entered and that the Order nunc pro\ntunc merely was her attempt to “qualify” that PSA as a QDRO\nacceptable to the Pension Plan as contemplated by 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3).\n\n                                  16\n\farguments in this regard as an attempt to “do an end-run around the\nlaw, which required a QDRO . . . .” The District Court held that the\nOrder nunc pro tunc “separate interest QDRO” could not be entered\nafter Rutyna’s death in light of our holding in Samaroo. Ultimately,\nthe District Court determined that “[r]egardless of whether [Files] is\nclaiming a survivorship right or not, the fact is that [she] is attempting\nto create a right to pension benefits which had lapsed after her ex-\nhusband had passed and this right was not clearly provided for in a\nQDRO prior to his death or in the PSA.”\n\n       Files initiated this timely appeal from the entry of summary\njudgment in favor of the Pension Plan, over which we exercise de\nnovo review and apply the same standard as the District Court.\nSamaroo, 193 F.3d at 189. In that regard, the District Court properly\napplied a de novo standard of review regarding the Pension Plan’s\ndenial of Files’s claim for pension benefits.             29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(G)(i)(II) requires only that the Pension Plan\nadministrator make the initial determination of whether an order is a\nQDRO. Id. (citing Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S.\n101, 115 (1989)). Whether either the PSA or the Order nunc pro tunc\nqualify as a QDRO under federal law are questions of statutory\nconstruction over which reviewing courts exercise de novo review.\nId.\n\n                            III. Discussion\n\n        Files contends that the District Court erred in its application\nof our holding in Samaroo. In Samaroo, we held, limited to the facts\nbefore us in that case, that a nunc pro tunc state court order entered\nafter the death of a pension plan participant and which awarded\nsurvivor benefits to the deceased participant’s ex-wife was not a\nQDRO because an entitlement to survivor benefits under a pension\nplan must be determined as of the date of the plan participant’s death.\n\n\n                                   17\n\fOtherwise, given that the plan’s pension obligations to its participant\nlapsed upon his death, a grant of survivor benefits nunc pro tunc\nmade posthumously would result in increased benefit obligations to\nthe plan. 193 F.3d at 190 and n.3. In contrast, Files asserts that her\nentitlement to fifty percent of Rutyna’s Pension Plan benefits was\nfully established upon the New Jersey Court’s adoption of the PSA\nin its July 16, 1998 Order, prior to Rutyna’s death. Files does not\nseek survivor benefits from the Pension Plan nor did she create a new\nentitlement to pension benefits through the Order nunc pro tunc.\nAccording to Files, she sought the Order nunc pro tunc in an effort to\nmeet the QDRO requirements in order to enforce her entitlement to\nfifty percent of Rutyna’s pension as granted to her by the PSA.\nIndeed, Files premises her arguments regarding the District Court’s\nassertedly erroneous application of Samaroo upon the fact that, in\ncontrast to the facts in Samaroo, she possessed an entitlement\npursuant to the PSA to fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension prior to\nRutyna’s death.\n\n         The Pension Plan characterizes the issue here as whether Files\ncould receive a share of Rutyna’s pension under state law without\nfirst meeting ERISA’s requirement that a QDRO, providing for a\nsurvivorship benefit, be submitted to the Pension Plan prior to his\ndeath. In an apparent attempt to place this case squarely within the\nlimited holding of Samaroo, the Pension Plan characterizes the\nbenefit sought by Files, through her submission to the Pension Plan\nof the Order nunc pro tunc, as a survivorship benefit that was not\nprovided for in the PSA. If that were the case, as the Pension Plan\nasserts, Samaroo would control. But, as set forth below, we conclude\nthat Files does not seek a survivorship benefit and that, therefore,\nSamaroo is not controlling.\n\n        Because the holding in Samaroo was expressly limited to its\nfacts, our decision here is informed by a close review of those facts.\n\n\n                                  18\n\fIn Samaroo, the AT&T Management Pension Plan sought a\ndeclaration that the ex-wife was not entitled to the pre-retirement\nbenefits of her ex-husband, who had died while still actively\nemployed by AT&T. In Samaroo, the divorce decree was silent as to\nthe pre-retirement survivor’s annuity, providing –\n\n       (d)     Pensions, Profit Sharing and Bell System\n               Savings Plan\n\n               Savings Plan - - (1) Husband has a vested\n               pension having a present value, if husband\n               were to retire at this time, of $1,358.59 per\n               month. At the time of husband’s retirement\n               and receipt of his pension he agrees to pay to\n               wife one half of said monthly amount.\n\nId. at 187. When ex-husband died nearly three years later while still\nactively working for AT&T, and before reaching the qualifying age\nfor pension payments, the pension benefit granted to the ex-wife and\nexpressly provided for in the divorce decree never came to fruition.\nAlthough the AT&T Pension Plan expressly provided for a pre-\nretirement survivor annuity for the surviving spouse of any Plan\nparticipant who died after vesting but before retiring, there was no\nannuity to be paid because there was no surviving spouse. Not\nsurprisingly, the AT&T Pension Plan denied the ex-wife’s claim for\nthe pre-retirement survivor annuity on the grounds that the DRO did\nnot mention her entitlement to such rights and there was no pre-\nretirement survivor’s annuity payable. The ex-wife thereafter\nobtained a nunc pro tunc amendment to the divorce decree to create\nsuch an entitlement, providing her with “rights of survivorship to\n50% of Husband’s vested pension benefits.”\n\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\f        On these facts, we held that the nunc pro tunc state court order\nwas not a QDRO and further determined that enforcing the amended\ndivorce decree would have resulted in an impermissible increase in\nplan benefits in violation of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D). We\nexpressly limited our holding to the facts there before us, noting that\nelevating the nunc pro tunc order to QDRO status essentially would\npermit the participant to change the operative facts “after he has lost\nthe gamble [on his longevity and retirement elections]” and “would\nwreak actuarial havoc on administration of the Plan.” Samaroo at\n190 and n.3.12\n\n        12\n          We reached our conclusion in Samaroo based in part upon\nconcerns that permitting the ex-wife in that case to alter her benefits\nafter the death of the plan participant essentially altered the actuarial\ncomputations relied upon by the plan given that the ex-husband died\nbefore becoming eligible to elect pension benefits. In that regard, we\nrelied upon the reasoning set forth in Hopkins v. AT & T Global\nInformation Solutions Co., 105 F.3d 153, 156 (4th Cir. 1997), where\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declined to\ngive QDRO status to a state order granting an ex-wife surviving\nspouse benefits in order to collect past-due alimony from her ex-\nhusband’s pension. The Hopkins court recognized that defined\nbenefit plans are based on actuarial calculations that would be\nrendered invalid if participants were allowed to change the operative\nfacts retroactively. The participant in Hopkins had retired and began\ndrawing on his pension in the form of a joint survivor annuity based\non the lives of himself and his second wife. It was after he had begun\ndrawing on this pension that his ex-wife obtained the state order\ndeclaring that she be treated as the surviving spouse. The Fourth\nCircuit held that the DRO was not a QDRO because the current\nwife’s right to the survivor’s benefits had already vested upon the\nplan participant’s retirement. Id. at 156-57. But, the key distinction\nbetween Hopkins and Files’s claim is that in Hopkins, there was an\n\n                                   20\n\f         The operative distinction between the facts here versus\nSamaroo is the type of benefit awarded to the ex-wives in the\nproperty settlements within the respective divorce decrees. Although\nthe issue of whether the divorce decree itself met ERISA’s QDRO\nrequirements was not before us in Samaroo, we nevertheless noted\nthe problems with granting that decree QDRO status, and our\nstatements in that regard are instructive to our analysis of the instant\ncase. First, in Samaroo, we determined that the decree evidenced an\nintention to divide only property rights existing at the time of the\ndivorce, not an intention to give the ex-wife an interest in post-\ndivorce earnings. Samaroo, 193 F.3d at 188 n.2. Second, we\nconcluded that the decree only gave the ex-wife an entitlement to\nbenefit payments when they were paid to the participant rather than\n“conveying to her a portion of . . . [ex-husband’s] interest in the\nPlan.” Id. In contrast, the PSA here conferred upon Files a fifty\npercent interest in Rutyna’s pension; in other words “conveying to her\na portion of . . . [husband’s] interest in the Plan” not limited to\nproperty rights existing as of the date of the divorce. See id. There\nwas no question that Files could have enforced her right to receive\nthat fifty percent interest on or after Rutyna’s fiftieth birthday (the\ndate the pension became payable), separate and apart from Rutyna’s\nelection regarding the remaining fifty percent. We conclude that Files\npossessed a separate interest in fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension as\nof the July 16, 1998 PSA.\n\n\n\nattempt to divest benefits already vested in a subsequent spouse,\nwhereas here, there was no such vesting, and therefore, no such\ndisruption to actuarial planning. See also Singleton v. Singleton, 290\nF. Supp. 2d 767 (W.D. Ky. 2003) (following Hopkins in preventing\nfirst wife, who never put plan on notice of QDRO, from displacing\nsecond wife as the surviving spouse as those benefits vested in second\nwife upon husband’s retirement).\n\n                                  21\n\f        Armed with this conclusion, we now turn to the question of\nwhether Files undertook appropriate steps to enforce her interest in\nRutyna’s pension benefits in light of the Pension Plan’s contention\nthat Rutyna’s death, in the absence of a QDRO providing for\nsurvivorship benefits, caused his pension to lapse. Nothing in ERISA\nrequires that the Pension Plan must have been notified of Files’s\ninterest in fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension prior to his death in order\nfor Files to engage in the process, contemplated by ERISA, of\n“qualifying” the PSA as a QDRO to enforce her already-existing\nproperty interest. See Trs. of Directors Guild of Am. Producer\nPension Benefits Plans v. Tise, 234 F.3d 415, 421, as amended upon\ndenial of reh’g, 255 F.3d 661 (9th Cir. 2000) (where child support\norder was converted to a QDRO nunc pro tunc after the death of plan\nparticipant, court reasoned there was nothing in ERISA requiring that\na QDRO must be finalized before benefits become payable). As was\nrecognized by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth\nCircuit in Tise, the detailed QDRO requirements set forth in ERISA\nare devoid of any requirement that a QDRO be in place before plan\nbenefits reach pay status under the plan. Id. at 421. Nor do the\nQDRO provisions of ERISA suggest that the alternate payee has no\ninterest in plan benefits until she obtains a QDRO; rather, they merely\nprevent enforcement of that already-existing interest until the QDRO\nis obtained. Id. (citing In re Gendreau, 122 F.3d 815, 819 (9th Cir.\n1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1005 (9th Cir. 1997)). In Gendreau, the\nNinth Circuit considered whether the husband/plan participant could,\nby filing for bankruptcy, prevent his ex-wife from obtaining a QDRO\ngiving effect to a divorce decree that awarded her fifty percent of his\npension. The court concluded that the ex-wife’s interest was created\nupon entry of the state order, which thereby also limited the\nhusband’s interest. These respective interests in the plan were not\naltered merely because the divorce decree did not meet the statutory\nrequirements for a QDRO. 122 F.3d at 819. What was required was\nfor the ex-wife to obtain a revised state court order that met the\n\n\n                                   22\n\fQDRO requirements in order to enforce the property interest\nconferred upon her by the divorce decree; the QDRO only related to\nenforcement of an already defined interest. Id. The court further\nrecognized that it was precisely because obtaining a QDRO is a time-\nconsuming process that ERISA recognizes periods where the status\nof a QDRO is at issue. Id. Similarly, we conclude that nothing in the\nstatutory language precluded Files from pursuing a QDRO after\nRutyna’s death to enforce her previously existing fifty percent interest\nin Rutyna’s pension. Despite the Pension Plan’s argument that all\npension benefits lapsed upon Rutyna’s death because there was no\nQDRO, Files’s pursuit of a QDRO posthumously comes within the\nambit of the “qualification” process contemplated within 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d) as she simply seeks to enforce an interest created prior to\nRutyna’s death.\n\n        Indeed, the statutory QDRO requirements expressly\ncontemplate a “qualification” process by which plans, once on notice\nof a state court DRO, will determine whether a state court DRO is\nsufficient to alter existing plan obligations. See 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(i)-(v). This “qualification” process commences\nwith a plan’s notice of the DRO. The statute expressly states that\nonce a plan receives a DRO, within “a reasonable period,” the\nadministrator shall determine whether that order is a QDRO, see 29\nU.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(G)(i)(II), and that each plan shall establish\nreasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic\nrelations orders, see 29 U.S.C. §§ 1056(d)(3)(G)(ii)(I)-(III). Thus, the\nstatute contemplates and the plan establishes the “process” by which\na DRO is “qualified.” Essential to this “qualification” process is the\nstatutory requirement that the plan take steps to ensure the\npreservation of benefits that are otherwise payable while the\ndetermination of QDRO status is undertaken. See Tise, 234 F.3d at\n421-22; 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(H)(i) (“[d]uring any period in which\nthe issue of whether a domestic relations order is a . . . [QDRO] . . .\n\n\n                                  23\n\fthe plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts . . .\nwhich would otherwise have been payable to the alternate payee\n. . . .”). In that regard, during the first eighteen months after which\nbenefits become payable, the plan must segregate the benefits\npotentially payable to the alternate payee.                 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(v). Moreover, ERISA contemplates further state\ncourt proceedings during the eighteen-month QDRO determination\nperiod in which the alternate payee can cure defects in the original\nDRO by obtaining modification to the original DRO in order to\nenforce it as a QDRO. Tise, 234 F.3d at 422 (citing 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(ii) (“[i]f within the 18-month period . . . the order (or\nmodification thereof) is determined to be a . . . [QDRO] . . . .”)). It\nis only after this eighteen-month period has expired that the putative\nalternate payee loses the right to uphold payment of plan proceeds to\na designated beneficiary. Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(H)). And\neven then, if the DRO ultimately is “qualified” as a QDRO, the\nobligations thereunder shall be applied prospectively. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(iv).\n\n        We now turn to when the “qualification” process was\ntriggered by notice to the Pension Plan of the PSA. Significantly, the\nPension Plan’s own policies and correspondence thwart its current\nassertion that it lacked notice of the PSA prior to Rutyna’s death.\nExxonMobil’s own policy as communicated to plan participants (and\npresumably those seeking QDROs) provided that a block is placed on\nboth the savings and pension accounts until a QDRO or other\ndocumentation is received by the Plan. Specifically, the “Information\nAbout Thrift and Annuity Plan Benefits as Part of the Divorce\nProcess” provided that “[o]nce Exxon’s Benefits Accounting or\nBenefits Administration Office receives written notice of a divorce\n(either pending or final), . . . [Savings] and . . . [Pension] Plan\nbenefits will generally be ‘blocked.’” Consistent with this policy and\nthe statutory mandate, the Savings Plan segregated Rutyna’s savings\n\n\n                                   24\n\faccount in response to the August 16, 2000 letter from Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel notifying it of the divorce. The record as to the\nsegregation of the pension account, however, is not as clear.\nAccording to Files, as early as August 29, 2000, the Pension Plan\nindicated in correspondence to Rutyna’s divorce counsel that both\nRutyna’s savings and pension accounts had been “blocked.”13 The\nPension Plan, however, subsequently clarified that the “block”\npertained only to the savings account. But, consistent with Files’s\nposition, Mr. Leis testified that once on notice of a divorce, the\nPension Plan generally would segregate pension benefits to ensure\nthat the funds were paid to the proper recipient (see supra. n.4).\nAgainst this backdrop, we conclude that it is disingenuous for the\nPension Plan to assert that lack of notice of the DRO caused Rutyna’s\npension benefits to lapse upon his death. We find persuasive the fact\nthat consistent with its own policies, at least one of the ExxonMobil\nplans deemed the August 16, 2000 letter sufficient notice to require\nsegregation of plan assets.\n\n        Even if we look to April 6, 2001, the date of the\ncorrespondence by which the Pension Plan was provided with an\nactual copy of the PSA, this notice standing alone triggered the\n“qualification” process for Files to enforce her rights under the PSA\ndespite the fact that it was provided after Rutyna’s death.14 Files’s\n\n\n       13\n          Notably, that August 29, 2000 correspondence is not in the\nrecord; rather, it is referenced within correspondence which is before\nus.\n       14\n         We reiterate that ERISA does not prescribe a time frame as\nto when, in relation to the state court’s entry of a domestic relations\norder, the plan must be presented with a copy of the domestic\nrelations order so-entered in order to trigger the QDRO process.\nRather, ERISA only provides that the “qualification” process is\n\n                                  25\n\fcounsel furthered the process by providing the Pension Plan with\ncopies of the proposed Order nunc pro tunc on August 9, 2001 and\nthe February 7, 2002 Order nunc pro tunc on February 28, 2002. The\nPension Plan’s response to its receipt of the Order nunc pro tunc\nreveals that the Pension Plan still was “qualifying” the PSA as a\nQDRO. Although the Pension Plan’s May 30, 2002 letter to Files’s\ncounsel indicated that it would not “continue the appeal to consider\nthe property settlement as a domestic relations order when the court\nhas entered a subsequent one which was submitted for consideration,”\nthe Order nunc pro tunc was Files’s attempt to “qualify” the PSA by\naddressing the Pension Plan’s stated concerns to date regarding its\nrecognition of the PSA as a QDRO.\n\n        Ultimately, it matters not whether we deem the Pension Plan\non notice prior to Rutyna’s death given its policies and the benefit\nsegregation undertaken by the Savings Plan, or after Rutyna’s death,\nwhen it received the PSA in April 2002. Regardless of notice, we\nreach the same conclusion – that Files simply engaged the statutorily\ncontemplated process to “qualify” the PSA as a QDRO in order to\nenforce pre-existing rights. Nothing in the statute, or in our\nprecedent, requires that a QDRO be in place prior to the death of a\nplan participant when the QDRO that is ultimately obtained by\nengaging the statutory process simply seeks to enforce a separate\ninterest in a pension benefit that existed before the death of the plan\nparticipant. See Tise, 234 F.3d at 421; Patton v. Denver Post Corp.,\n326 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (10th Cir. 2003) (upholding a nunc pro tunc\nDRO issued eleven years after a divorce decree pertaining to plan\nbenefits from a plan not known about at the time of the divorce, and\ndeclining to infer that the plan must have been notified of the interest\nprior to the death of the participant); Hogan v. Raytheon Co., 302\n\n\ntriggered by “notice” to the plan of the state court domestic relations\norder.\n\n                                  26\n\fF.3d 854, 857 (8th Cir. 2002) (permitting posthumous qualification\nof a DRO because during husband-participant’s life, plan was\nprovided with a copy of divorce decree awarding ex-wife fifty percent\nof husband-participant’s present retirement funds, and DRO obtained\nsubsequent to husband-participant’s death designating ex-wife as\nalternate payee for purposes of survivorship benefits was done within\nthe eighteen month period permitted to secure a QDRO).\n\n                          IV. Conclusion\n\n        Based on the foregoing, we will reverse the order of the\nDistrict Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 27\n\f",

As to the PSA entered before the ex-husband’s\ndeath, the District Court concluded that it did not meet the statutory\nQDRO requirements and that any attempt to qualify that order as a\nQDRO after his death to provide the ex-wife with survivorship\nbenefits was improper under Samaroo. Because we conclude that the\nPSA constituted a QDRO pursuant to the process contemplated\nwithin 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3), providing the ex-wife with a separate\ninterest in the pension benefit prior to her ex-husband’s death, we will\nreverse the District Court’s order and remand for further proceedings.\n\n                               I. Facts\n\n        Rita Files (“Files”) married Ed Rutyna (“Rutyna”) in\nNovember 1972. Rutyna worked for ExxonMobil from September\n5, 1972 to April 7, 1993, and participated in two ERISA-governed\nplans through ExxonMobil – the Pension Plan and a Savings Plan\n(formerly known as the Exxon Thrift Plan) (“Savings Plan”).1 When\nhe left ExxonMobil in 1993, Rutyna had a fully-vested pension\nentitlement. However, since he was under fifty years of age, he was\n\n       1\n         The Pension Plan and Savings Plan, although distinct benefit\nplans, share the same administration.\n\n                                   3\n\fnot yet eligible to receive his pension; the earliest he would become\neligible would be September of 1996, on reaching fifty.\n\n        Nearly two years after Rutyna could begin receiving pension\nbenefits, Rutyna and Files agreed to the PSA, which was incorporated\ninto the Dual Judgment of Divorce entered by the New Jersey Court\non July 16, 1998. Paragraph 3.2 of the PSA, provided in relevant\npart:\n\n       The Husband is the owner of an Exxon pension and\n       Exxon . . . [Savings] Account and a TOSCO pension.\n       Wife hereby waives, now and forever, any right, title\n       or claim on the Husband’s TOSCO pension funds.\n       The wife shall be entitled to one-half of the Exxon\n       pension and one-half of the Exxon . . . [Savings]\n       Account. The transfer shall be by QDRO [“qualified\n       domestic relations order”] as to the pension and by\n       transfer to an account designated by the wife as to the\n       . . . [Savings] Account.\n\n        After the PSA was entered by the New Jersey Court, Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel, by letter dated August 16, 2000, advised the\nExxonMobil Benefits Administrative Office (“Benefits\nAdministrator”) of the divorce and requested a sample QDRO “in\norder to distribute his Pension and . . . [Savings] fund in accordance\nwith the terms of the divorce.”2 The Benefits Administrator\n\n       2\n        Because of the importance of the statutory scheme to an\nunderstanding of the parties’ respective positions regarding whether\nthe PSA meets the statutory requirements for a QDRO, we set forth\nthe relevant statutory provisions throughout our factual recitation.\nERISA’s anti-alienation provision states that “[e]ach pension plan\nshall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be\n\n                                  4\n\fresponded, by letter dated September 16, 2000, that Rutyna’s written\nauthorization was required for the release of information. By letter\ndated September 18, 2000, Rutyna’s divorce counsel provided\nRutyna’s authorization for the release of information to distribute his\npension and savings accounts in accordance with the terms of the\nPSA. The Benefits Administrator then provided, by letter dated\nSeptember 29, 2000, a Pension Plan estimate, a statement of account\nfor the Savings Plan as of September 27, 2000, a package of materials\nexplaining the Pension Plan’s QDRO policies and practices, and a\nsample QDRO. An enclosed Q & A sheet entitled “Information\nAbout Thrift and Annuity Plan Benefits as Part of the Divorce\nProcess” stated that –\n\n\nassigned or alienated.” 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(1). The REA amended\nthat anti-alienation provision by setting forth a process to give effect\nto divorce decrees and state-court orders that pertain to ERISA\nregulated plans if the order is determined to be a QDRO.

He further\ncharacterized this as “an administration procedure that we didn’t send\nmoney to the wrong parties.” Id. Although Files contends that the\nExxonMobil Human Resources Department confirmed, in\n\n                                  7\n\fBut, Rutyna’s divorce counsel never provided the QDRO information\nreceived from the Pension Plan to either Files or her counsel. When\nRutyna died on February 25, 2001 at age 54, no QDRO had been\nsubmitted to the Pension Plan.\n\n        After Rutyna’s death, a letter exchange ensued between Files\nand the Benefits Administrator setting forth their respective positions\nregarding Files’s entitlement to benefits under each Plan pursuant to\nthe PSA. Three (3) days after Rutyna’s death, Files’s divorce counsel\nnotified Exxon’s legal department of the death, acknowledged that no\nQDRO had been filed, and inquired whether the Pension Plan would\nhonor the PSA. Files herself also notified the Plans of Rutyna’s death\nin her capacity as executrix of his estate. The Benefits Administrator\nreplied to Files by letter dated March 14, 2001, seeking a death\ncertificate and stating unequivocally that as to the Pension Plan “there\nare no survivor benefits due and payable.”5 Files’s new counsel (also\n\n\ncorrespondence to Rutyna’s divorce counsel dated August 29, 2000,\nthat a block was placed on both the savings and pension accounts, the\nPension Plan clarified in its correspondence of October 24, 2001 to\nFiles’s counsel that the block pertained only to the savings account.\nConsequently, whether the block also pertained to the pension\naccount is subject to dispute.\n        5\n         From the outset, the Plan characterized the pension benefits\nsought by Files as “survivor benefits,” which are explicitly provided\nfor within ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. § 1055. 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(F)\nprovides that to the extent provided for in a QDRO, a former spouse\nof a plan participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse for\npurposes of § 1055 (providing for mandatory plan provisions\nregarding joint and survivor annuity and pre-retirement survivor\nannuity provisions). ERISA, however, does not insist that a state\ncourt recognize a former spouse as an alternate payee to such an\n\n                                   8\n\fher counsel in this appeal), then wrote to the Plans on March 31,\n2001, requesting summary plan documents and asking that no\ndistribution be made until he could determine whether the PSA met\nthe QDRO requirements for each Plan. A week later, by letter dated\nApril 6, 2001, Files’s counsel wrote another letter, enclosing the PSA,\nexplaining Files’s position that the PSA was a QDRO as to both the\nSavings and Pension Plans, and requesting distribution of benefits\npursuant to both Plans. But, that letter characterized the pension\nbenefit sought as a fifty percent “survivor benefit” under the Pension\nPlan and requested forms to allow Files to “elect commencement of\nher surviving spouse benefit.”6\n\n        The administrator of both the Savings and the Pension Plans,\nby letter of July 18, 2001, denied Files’s claim for benefits pursuant\nto the PSA, indicating within its determination that: (1) the PSA\n\n\ninterest in her spouse’s pension, but merely yields to the prerogative\nof state law to do so. See Critchell v. Critchell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">746</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286\n(D.C. Cir. 2000). Nor does ERISA limit the plan benefits that may\nbe addressed within state court domestic relations orders to “survivor\nbenefits.” Accordingly, the Plan’s characterization of the benefits\nFiles seeks as “survivor benefits” does not control our determination\nof whether the domestic relations orders in question constitute\nQDROs.\n       6\n          We note that the imprecision in characterizing Files’s claim\nfor pension benefits as one for a “fifty percent survivorship benefit”\nin light of the Plans March 14, 2001 correspondence stating that as to\nthe Pension Plan there were no “survivor benefits due and payable”\nonly served to confuse this already difficult record as to the benefit\nthat Files actually sought. That imprecision, however, was later\nclarified by Files’s counsel when describing her claim as one for a\n“separate interest” in fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension benefits.\n\n                                  9\n\fwould be treated as a QDRO for purposes of the Savings Plan (and\nspecifically that Files would get one-half of that account and, because\nof the lack of a beneficiary designation, Rutyna’s children would get\nthe remainder); (2) the PSA would not be treated as a QDRO for\npurposes of the Pension Plan; and (3) the absence of an award of\n“survivor benefits to Alternate Payee” in the PSA, coupled with\nRutyna’s death before either Files or Rutyna commenced their receipt\nof Pension Plan benefits, resulted in no benefits payable to Files as an\n“Alternate Payee” because the PSA did not award her surviving\nspouse benefits.7 That letter also stated that the Pension Plan would\n\n       7\n          The Pension Plan based its denial of QDRO status to the PSA\nas regards the pension on the following statutory provisions. A\ndomestic relations order is a QDRO “only if such order clearly\nspecifies . . . (i) the name and last known mailing address . . . of the\nparticipant and . . . of each alternate payee covered by the order,\n(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant’s benefits to be paid\nby the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such\namount or percentage is to be determined, (iii) the number of\npayments or period to which such order applies, and (iv) each plan to\nwhich such order applies,” (29 U.S.C. § 1056 (d)(3)(C)(i)-(iv)) and\n“only if such order –\n\n       (i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form\n       of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided\n       under the plan,\n       (ii) does not require a plan to provide increased\n       benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value),\n       and\n       (iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an\n       alternate payee which are required to be paid to\n       another alternate payee under another order previously\n       determined to be a . . . [QDRO].”\n\n                                  10\n\fnot entertain a nunc pro tunc order with respect to the Pension Plan\nsurvivor benefits as that would violate 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D) by\nrequiring the Pension Plan to pay increased benefits. The Pension\nPlan’s position is premised on its determination that Rutyna’s pension\nbenefits lapsed upon his death in the absence of any designated\nsurvivor annuity; consequently, any state court DRO providing for\npayment of pension benefits to an alternate payee that was presented\nto the Pension Plan subsequent to Rutyna’s death would, in the\nPension Plan’s opinion, result in the Pension Plan having to provide\nincreased benefits in violation of 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D)(ii).\n\n        By letter dated August 9, 2001, Files’s counsel appealed\nadministratively the Pension Plan’s denial of Files’s claim for pension\nbenefits pursuant to the PSA. In that letter, Files’s counsel stated that\nit was his understanding, based on the block placed on the savings\naccount, that the Pension Plan was on notice of the divorce\nproceedings prior to Rutyna’s death. He further explained that Files\nwas seeking to enforce an interest created by the PSA during\nRutyna’s lifetime, entitling her to fifty percent of Rutyna’s accrued\nbenefits, which was enforceable by Files in her own right regardless\nof Rutyna’s death because that interest was not a surviving spouse\nbenefit. Files’s counsel also enclosed with that letter “a proposed\nform of separate interest QDRO” and inquired whether it would\nqualify as a QDRO for Pension Plan purposes upon its entry by the\nNew Jersey Court. The letter explained: “It should be evident from\nthe interest thereby created that Ms. Files[’s] benefit is neither a\nsurvivor benefit nor a benefit that would increase the Plan’s cost . . .\n[A]s structured the benefit would have been removed from Mr.\nRutyna’s interest effective as of the date of the...[PSA].”\n\n\n\n\n29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D)(i)-(iii).\n\n                                   11\n\f        The Pension Plan again denied Files’s claim for benefits\npursuant to the PSA on October 24, 2001. First, the Pension Plan\nclarified that a block had been placed only on Rutyna’s savings\naccount, not on his pension account. Next, the Pension Plan quoted\nextensively from its Summary Plan Description to support its denial\n– “if a terminee [which is what Rutyna was8] dies before a vested\npension benefit payment begins and without a surviving spouse no\nbenefit is payable.” The Pension Plan concluded as follows:\n\n       We have reviewed the 1998 PSA and have determined\n       that it does not specifically state that Ms. Files shall\n       be considered a surviving spouse. Survivor benefits\n       are fixed as of the participant’s death and the\n       proposed DRO . . . would expand the liability of the\n       Plan. Your argument that a separate interest DRO\n       would have given Ms. Files survivor rights is well\n       taken but there is no assurance that a separate interest\n       DRO is what would have been agreed to by the\n       parties. Therefore, we cannot qualify the . . .\n       [proposed DRO] as a QDRO at this time as no\n       pension benefits are payable in accordance with . . .\n       the Plan.\n\nFiles’s counsel replied with yet another appeal dated December 17,\n2001, again requesting pension benefits pursuant to the PSA. He\nexplained that a QDRO was entered within the eighteen month\nsegregation period following notice to the Plan of the divorce\nproceedings. The letter continued that because Files was granted a\nseparate interest enforceable under state law effective upon entry of\n\n       8\n        The Summary Plan Description for the Pension Plan defines\n“terminee” as a “person who separates from service without\nbecoming a retiree.”\n\n                                 12\n\fthe PSA, after entry of the QDRO, that interest must be paid to her\nupon her request following Rutyna’s earliest retirement age under the\nPension Plan.\n\n       In light of the Pension Plan’s continued denial of Files’s claim\npursuant to the terms of the PSA, upon Files’s request, the New\nJersey Court entered a subsequent order dated February 7, 2002,\nproviding:\n\n       NOW, THEREFORE, the Court does hereby enter\n       this Order nunc pro tunc from the date of the . . .\n       [PSA], July 16, 1998, as and for a Qualified Domestic\n       Relations Order [QDRO] within the meaning of . . .\n       Section 206(d) of . . . [ERISA], for the express\n       purpose of enabling . . . [Files] to compel the . . .\n       [Pension Plan] to make payment to her of her property\n       entitlement under state law in accordance with the\n       Domestic Relations Order embodied in this Court’s\n       Dual Judgment of Divorce entered on July 16, 1998.\n\n(hereinafter, “Order nunc pro tunc”). By letter dated February 28,\n2002, a copy of this Order nunc pro tunc was forwarded to the\nPension Plan, which it forwarded to its consultants for review. On\nMay 30, 2002, the Pension Plan informed Files that, given the entry\nof the Order nunc pro tunc, it was no longer considering whether the\nPSA would qualify as a QDRO. By letter dated October 7, 2002, the\nPension Plan’s consultants denied Files’s claim for benefits pursuant\nto the Order nunc pro tunc explaining:\n\n       [The Pension Plan] will not qualify an order\n       pertaining to the [Pension Plan] that is first submitted\n       to the Plan and entered by the Court after a\n       participant’s date of death. On the date of [Rutyna’s]\n\n\n                                  13\n\f       death, he was not married, and the Plan did not have\n       a QDRO on file pertaining to his benefit. Therefore\n       in accordance with the terms of the Plan, no further\n       benefit is payable to any party.\n\n                       II. Procedural History\n\n        Files initiated this action by filing a four count complaint in\nthe United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In\nCount I, against the Pension Plan and its Administrator, she requested\nbenefits and alleged a breach of fiduciary duty claim related to the\nPension Plan’s failure and refusal to pay her benefits in accordance\nwith the PSA or the Order nunc pro tunc. In Counts II through IV,\nshe alleged legal malpractice against both her own and Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel, alleging that counsel had failed to effectuate the\ntransfer of her interest in the Pension Plan benefits by (1) failing to\nprepare the PSA in a form that would be enforced by the Pension\nPlan; (2) failing to prepare a QDRO prior to Rutyna’s death in a form\nthat would be enforced by the Pension Plan; and (3) failing to obtain\nthe Pension Plan’s approval of either the PSA or another domestic\nrelations order as a QDRO prior to Rutyna’s death.\n\n       On cross-motions for summary judgment regarding Count I\nof the Complaint, the District Court denied Files’s motion and\ngranted the Pension Plan’s.9 At the outset, the District Court\ncharacterized Files’s position as not seeking a survivorship benefit\nthrough her separate interest QDRO obtained by the Order nunc pro\n\n       9\n        Although the District Court continued to exercise\nsupplemental jurisdiction over the legal malpractice claims, a consent\njudgment was entered later against Rutyna’s divorce counsel, and the\nremaining counsel defendants were dismissed, with the District Court\nretaining jurisdiction for enforcement of the consent judgment.\n\n                                  14\n\ftunc, but instead as seeking to be paid the separate property interest\nawarded to her by the terms of the PSA. The Pension Plan argued\nthat Files sought a property interest not provided for by law and was\nnot entitled to survivorship benefits pursuant to ERISA in light of her\ncounsel’s failure to file the QDRO with the Pension Plan prior to\nRutyna’s death. The District Court agreed with the Pension Plan.\n\n        The District Court first determined that despite Files’s\nassertion, the PSA did not meet the requirements of a QDRO. In the\ncourse of its reasoning, the District Court determined that Rutyna\ncould not assign or alienate his benefits except through a QDRO\npursuant to the REA, which amended ERISA’s anti-alienation\nprovision. 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(A).10 Next, the District Court\ndetermined that the PSA failed to meet the statutory requirements of\na QDRO as set forth in 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(B)-(D). Specifically,\nthe District Court determined that the PSA failed to name Files as an\n\n       10\n            That provision provides:\n\n       (d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits\n       (1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits\n       provided under the plan may not be assigned or\n       alienated.\n               *      *       *\n       (3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation,\n       assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit\n       payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a\n       domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1)\n       shall not apply if the order is determined to be a\n       qualified domestic relations order [QDRO]. Each\n       pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits\n       in accordance with the applicable requirements of any\n       qualified domestic relations order.\n\n                                  15\n\f“alternate payee” as required by § 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I); did not detail\nthe number of payments or pay period as required by\n§ 1056(d)(3)(C)(iii); would require the Pension Plan to provide\nincreased benefits as prohibited by § 1056(d)(3)(D)(ii); and did not\ndesignate Files as a surviving spouse as permitted by § 1056(d)(3)(F).\n\n        Relying on our decision in Samaroo, the District Court then\naffirmed the Pension Plan’s refusal to honor the Order nunc pro tunc.\nThe District Court characterized our holding in Samaroo as “where\na PSA or divorce judgment does not create a survivorship right to\npension benefits, a QDRO entered after the death of the plan\nparticipant also cannot do so,” and further explained that per our\nSamaroo holding, the Order nunc pro tunc was not a QDRO because\nit violated the prohibition against requiring the Pension Plan to\nprovide increased benefits “by providing for a survivorship interest\nin benefits that had lapsed after the participant’s death.” Accordingly,\nthe District Court concluded that because it was undisputed that a\nQDRO was never filed with the Pension Plan and that Rutyna’s\nbenefits lapsed upon his death, any attempt by Files to obtain a nunc\npro tunc amendment to the PSA must fail.\n\n        Second, the District Court rejected Files’s argument that the\nOrder nunc pro tunc was a “separate interest QDRO” which did not\ncreate survivorship interests, but rather reaffirmed that the PSA had\ngranted Files a fifty percent property interest in Rutyna’s pension that\ndid not lapse upon his death.11 The District Court viewed Files’s\n\n       11\n         As explained more fully within, we understand Files to be\nasserting that the PSA created her separate interest in Rutyna’s\npension at the time the PSA was entered and that the Order nunc pro\ntunc merely was her attempt to “qualify” that PSA as a QDRO\nacceptable to the Pension Plan as contemplated by 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3).\n\n                                  16\n\farguments in this regard as an attempt to “do an end-run around the\nlaw, which required a QDRO . . . .” The District Court held that the\nOrder nunc pro tunc “separate interest QDRO” could not be entered\nafter Rutyna’s death in light of our holding in Samaroo. Ultimately,\nthe District Court determined that “[r]egardless of whether [Files] is\nclaiming a survivorship right or not, the fact is that [she] is attempting\nto create a right to pension benefits which had lapsed after her ex-\nhusband had passed and this right was not clearly provided for in a\nQDRO prior to his death or in the PSA.”\n\n       Files initiated this timely appeal from the entry of summary\njudgment in favor of the Pension Plan, over which we exercise de\nnovo review and apply the same standard as the District Court.\nSamaroo, 193 F.3d at 189. In that regard, the District Court properly\napplied a de novo standard of review regarding the Pension Plan’s\ndenial of Files’s claim for pension benefits.             29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(G)(i)(II) requires only that the Pension Plan\nadministrator make the initial determination of whether an order is a\nQDRO. Id. (citing Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112197\"><a href=\"/opinion/112197/firestone-tire-rubber-co-v-bruch/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (1989)). Whether either the PSA or the Order nunc pro tunc\nqualify as a QDRO under federal law are questions of statutory\nconstruction over which reviewing courts exercise de novo review.\nId.\n\n                            III. Discussion\n\n        Files contends that the District Court erred in its application\nof our holding in Samaroo. In Samaroo, we held, limited to the facts\nbefore us in that case, that a nunc pro tunc state court order entered\nafter the death of a pension plan participant and which awarded\nsurvivor benefits to the deceased participant’s ex-wife was not a\nQDRO because an entitlement to survivor benefits under a pension\nplan must be determined as of the date of the plan participant’s death.\n\n\n                                   17\n\fOtherwise, given that the plan’s pension obligations to its participant\nlapsed upon his death, a grant of survivor benefits nunc pro tunc\nmade posthumously would result in increased benefit obligations to\nthe plan. 193 F.3d at 190 and n.3. In contrast, Files asserts that her\nentitlement to fifty percent of Rutyna’s Pension Plan benefits was\nfully established upon the New Jersey Court’s adoption of the PSA\nin its July 16, 1998 Order, prior to Rutyna’s death. Files does not\nseek survivor benefits from the Pension Plan nor did she create a new\nentitlement to pension benefits through the Order nunc pro tunc.\nAccording to Files, she sought the Order nunc pro tunc in an effort to\nmeet the QDRO requirements in order to enforce her entitlement to\nfifty percent of Rutyna’s pension as granted to her by the PSA.\nIndeed, Files premises her arguments regarding the District Court’s\nassertedly erroneous application of Samaroo upon the fact that, in\ncontrast to the facts in Samaroo, she possessed an entitlement\npursuant to the PSA to fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension prior to\nRutyna’s death.\n\n         The Pension Plan characterizes the issue here as whether Files\ncould receive a share of Rutyna’s pension under state law without\nfirst meeting ERISA’s requirement that a QDRO, providing for a\nsurvivorship benefit, be submitted to the Pension Plan prior to his\ndeath. In an apparent attempt to place this case squarely within the\nlimited holding of Samaroo, the Pension Plan characterizes the\nbenefit sought by Files, through her submission to the Pension Plan\nof the Order nunc pro tunc, as a survivorship benefit that was not\nprovided for in the PSA. If that were the case, as the Pension Plan\nasserts, Samaroo would control. But, as set forth below, we conclude\nthat Files does not seek a survivorship benefit and that, therefore,\nSamaroo is not controlling.\n\n        Because the holding in Samaroo was expressly limited to its\nfacts, our decision here is informed by a close review of those facts.\n\n\n                                  18\n\fIn Samaroo, the AT&T Management Pension Plan sought a\ndeclaration that the ex-wife was not entitled to the pre-retirement\nbenefits of her ex-husband, who had died while still actively\nemployed by AT&T. In Samaroo, the divorce decree was silent as to\nthe pre-retirement survivor’s annuity, providing –\n\n       (d)     Pensions, Profit Sharing and Bell System\n               Savings Plan\n\n               Savings Plan - - (1) Husband has a vested\n               pension having a present value, if husband\n               were to retire at this time, of $1,358.59 per\n               month. At the time of husband’s retirement\n               and receipt of his pension he agrees to pay to\n               wife one half of said monthly amount.\n\nId. at 187. When ex-husband died nearly three years later while still\nactively working for AT&T, and before reaching the qualifying age\nfor pension payments, the pension benefit granted to the ex-wife and\nexpressly provided for in the divorce decree never came to fruition.\nAlthough the AT&T Pension Plan expressly provided for a pre-\nretirement survivor annuity for the surviving spouse of any Plan\nparticipant who died after vesting but before retiring, there was no\nannuity to be paid because there was no surviving spouse. Not\nsurprisingly, the AT&T Pension Plan denied the ex-wife’s claim for\nthe pre-retirement survivor annuity on the grounds that the DRO did\nnot mention her entitlement to such rights and there was no pre-\nretirement survivor’s annuity payable. The ex-wife thereafter\nobtained a nunc pro tunc amendment to the divorce decree to create\nsuch an entitlement, providing her with “rights of survivorship to\n50% of Husband’s vested pension benefits.”\n\n\n\n\n                                 19\n\f        On these facts, we held that the nunc pro tunc state court order\nwas not a QDRO and further determined that enforcing the amended\ndivorce decree would have resulted in an impermissible increase in\nplan benefits in violation of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(D). We\nexpressly limited our holding to the facts there before us, noting that\nelevating the nunc pro tunc order to QDRO status essentially would\npermit the participant to change the operative facts “after he has lost\nthe gamble [on his longevity and retirement elections]” and “would\nwreak actuarial havoc on administration of the Plan.” Samaroo at\n190 and n.3.12\n\n        12\n          We reached our conclusion in Samaroo based in part upon\nconcerns that permitting the ex-wife in that case to alter her benefits\nafter the death of the plan participant essentially altered the actuarial\ncomputations relied upon by the plan given that the ex-husband died\nbefore becoming eligible to elect pension benefits. In that regard, we\nrelied upon the reasoning set forth in Hopkins v. AT & T Global\nInformation Solutions Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733405\"><a href=\"/opinion/733405/vera-mae-hopkins-v-at-t-global-information-solutions-company-formerly/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156 (4th Cir. 1997), where\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit declined to\ngive QDRO status to a state order granting an ex-wife surviving\nspouse benefits in order to collect past-due alimony from her ex-\nhusband’s pension. The Hopkins court recognized that defined\nbenefit plans are based on actuarial calculations that would be\nrendered invalid if participants were allowed to change the operative\nfacts retroactively. The participant in Hopkins had retired and began\ndrawing on his pension in the form of a joint survivor annuity based\non the lives of himself and his second wife. It was after he had begun\ndrawing on this pension that his ex-wife obtained the state order\ndeclaring that she be treated as the surviving spouse. The Fourth\nCircuit held that the DRO was not a QDRO because the current\nwife’s right to the survivor’s benefits had already vested upon the\nplan participant’s retirement. Id. at 156-57. But, the key distinction\nbetween Hopkins and Files’s claim is that in Hopkins, there was an\n\n                                   20\n\f         The operative distinction between the facts here versus\nSamaroo is the type of benefit awarded to the ex-wives in the\nproperty settlements within the respective divorce decrees. Although\nthe issue of whether the divorce decree itself met ERISA’s QDRO\nrequirements was not before us in Samaroo, we nevertheless noted\nthe problems with granting that decree QDRO status, and our\nstatements in that regard are instructive to our analysis of the instant\ncase. First, in Samaroo, we determined that the decree evidenced an\nintention to divide only property rights existing at the time of the\ndivorce, not an intention to give the ex-wife an interest in post-\ndivorce earnings. Samaroo, 193 F.3d at 188 n.2. Second, we\nconcluded that the decree only gave the ex-wife an entitlement to\nbenefit payments when they were paid to the participant rather than\n“conveying to her a portion of . . . [ex-husband’s] interest in the\nPlan.” Id. In contrast, the PSA here conferred upon Files a fifty\npercent interest in Rutyna’s pension; in other words “conveying to her\na portion of . . . [husband’s] interest in the Plan” not limited to\nproperty rights existing as of the date of the divorce. See id. There\nwas no question that Files could have enforced her right to receive\nthat fifty percent interest on or after Rutyna’s fiftieth birthday (the\ndate the pension became payable), separate and apart from Rutyna’s\nelection regarding the remaining fifty percent. We conclude that Files\npossessed a separate interest in fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension as\nof the July 16, 1998 PSA.\n\n\n\nattempt to divest benefits already vested in a subsequent spouse,\nwhereas here, there was no such vesting, and therefore, no such\ndisruption to actuarial planning.

Nothing in ERISA\nrequires that the Pension Plan must have been notified of Files’s\ninterest in fifty percent of Rutyna’s pension prior to his death in order\nfor Files to engage in the process, contemplated by ERISA, of\n“qualifying” the PSA as a QDRO to enforce her already-existing\nproperty interest.

The court concluded that the ex-wife’s interest was created\nupon entry of the state order, which thereby also limited the\nhusband’s interest. These respective interests in the plan were not\naltered merely because the divorce decree did not meet the statutory\nrequirements for a QDRO. 122 F.3d at 819. What was required was\nfor the ex-wife to obtain a revised state court order that met the\n\n\n                                   22\n\fQDRO requirements in order to enforce the property interest\nconferred upon her by the divorce decree; the QDRO only related to\nenforcement of an already defined interest. Id. The court further\nrecognized that it was precisely because obtaining a QDRO is a time-\nconsuming process that ERISA recognizes periods where the status\nof a QDRO is at issue. Id. Similarly, we conclude that nothing in the\nstatutory language precluded Files from pursuing a QDRO after\nRutyna’s death to enforce her previously existing fifty percent interest\nin Rutyna’s pension. Despite the Pension Plan’s argument that all\npension benefits lapsed upon Rutyna’s death because there was no\nQDRO, Files’s pursuit of a QDRO posthumously comes within the\nambit of the “qualification” process contemplated within 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d) as she simply seeks to enforce an interest created prior to\nRutyna’s death.\n\n        Indeed, the statutory QDRO requirements expressly\ncontemplate a “qualification” process by which plans, once on notice\nof a state court DRO, will determine whether a state court DRO is\nsufficient to alter existing plan obligations. See 29 U.S.C.\n§§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(i)-(v). This “qualification” process commences\nwith a plan’s notice of the DRO. The statute expressly states that\nonce a plan receives a DRO, within “a reasonable period,” the\nadministrator shall determine whether that order is a QDRO, see 29\nU.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(G)(i)(II), and that each plan shall establish\nreasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic\nrelations orders, see 29 U.S.C. §§ 1056(d)(3)(G)(ii)(I)-(III). Thus, the\nstatute contemplates and the plan establishes the “process” by which\na DRO is “qualified.” Essential to this “qualification” process is the\nstatutory requirement that the plan take steps to ensure the\npreservation of benefits that are otherwise payable while the\ndetermination of QDRO status is undertaken. See Tise, 234 F.3d at\n421-22; 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(H)(i) (“[d]uring any period in which\nthe issue of whether a domestic relations order is a . . . [QDRO] . . .\n\n\n                                  23\n\fthe plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts . . .\nwhich would otherwise have been payable to the alternate payee\n. . . .”). In that regard, during the first eighteen months after which\nbenefits become payable, the plan must segregate the benefits\npotentially payable to the alternate payee.                 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(v). Moreover, ERISA contemplates further state\ncourt proceedings during the eighteen-month QDRO determination\nperiod in which the alternate payee can cure defects in the original\nDRO by obtaining modification to the original DRO in order to\nenforce it as a QDRO. Tise, 234 F.3d at 422 (citing 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(ii) (“[i]f within the 18-month period . . . the order (or\nmodification thereof) is determined to be a . . . [QDRO] . . . .”)). It\nis only after this eighteen-month period has expired that the putative\nalternate payee loses the right to uphold payment of plan proceeds to\na designated beneficiary. Id. (citing 29 U.S.C. § 1056(d)(3)(H)). And\neven then, if the DRO ultimately is “qualified” as a QDRO, the\nobligations thereunder shall be applied prospectively. See 29 U.S.C.\n§ 1056(d)(3)(H)(iv).\n\n        We now turn to when the “qualification” process was\ntriggered by notice to the Pension Plan of the PSA. Significantly, the\nPension Plan’s own policies and correspondence thwart its current\nassertion that it lacked notice of the PSA prior to Rutyna’s death.\nExxonMobil’s own policy as communicated to plan participants (and\npresumably those seeking QDROs) provided that a block is placed on\nboth the savings and pension accounts until a QDRO or other\ndocumentation is received by the Plan. Specifically, the “Information\nAbout Thrift and Annuity Plan Benefits as Part of the Divorce\nProcess” provided that “[o]nce Exxon’s Benefits Accounting or\nBenefits Administration Office receives written notice of a divorce\n(either pending or final), . . . [Savings] and . . . [Pension] Plan\nbenefits will generally be ‘blocked.’” Consistent with this policy and\nthe statutory mandate, the Savings Plan segregated Rutyna’s savings\n\n\n                                   24\n\faccount in response to the August 16, 2000 letter from Rutyna’s\ndivorce counsel notifying it of the divorce. The record as to the\nsegregation of the pension account, however, is not as clear.\nAccording to Files, as early as August 29, 2000, the Pension Plan\nindicated in correspondence to Rutyna’s divorce counsel that both\nRutyna’s savings and pension accounts had been “blocked.”13 The\nPension Plan, however, subsequently clarified that the “block”\npertained only to the savings account. But, consistent with Files’s\nposition, Mr. Leis testified that once on notice of a divorce, the\nPension Plan generally would segregate pension benefits to ensure\nthat the funds were paid to the proper recipient (see supra. n.4).\nAgainst this backdrop, we conclude that it is disingenuous for the\nPension Plan to assert that lack of notice of the DRO caused Rutyna’s\npension benefits to lapse upon his death. We find persuasive the fact\nthat consistent with its own policies, at least one of the ExxonMobil\nplans deemed the August 16, 2000 letter sufficient notice to require\nsegregation of plan assets.\n\n        Even if we look to April 6, 2001, the date of the\ncorrespondence by which the Pension Plan was provided with an\nactual copy of the PSA, this notice standing alone triggered the\n“qualification” process for Files to enforce her rights under the PSA\ndespite the fact that it was provided after Rutyna’s death.14 Files’s\n\n\n       13\n          Notably, that August 29, 2000 correspondence is not in the\nrecord; rather, it is referenced within correspondence which is before\nus.\n       14\n         We reiterate that ERISA does not prescribe a time frame as\nto when, in relation to the state court’s entry of a domestic relations\norder, the plan must be presented with a copy of the domestic\nrelations order so-entered in order to trigger the QDRO process.\nRather, ERISA only provides that the “qualification” process is\n\n                                  25\n\fcounsel furthered the process by providing the Pension Plan with\ncopies of the proposed Order nunc pro tunc on August 9, 2001 and\nthe February 7, 2002 Order nunc pro tunc on February 28, 2002. The\nPension Plan’s response to its receipt of the Order nunc pro tunc\nreveals that the Pension Plan still was “qualifying” the PSA as a\nQDRO. Although the Pension Plan’s May 30, 2002 letter to Files’s\ncounsel indicated that it would not “continue the appeal to consider\nthe property settlement as a domestic relations order when the court\nhas entered a subsequent one which was submitted for consideration,”\nthe Order nunc pro tunc was Files’s attempt to “qualify” the PSA by\naddressing the Pension Plan’s stated concerns to date regarding its\nrecognition of the PSA as a QDRO.\n\n        Ultimately, it matters not whether we deem the Pension Plan\non notice prior to Rutyna’s death given its policies and the benefit\nsegregation undertaken by the Savings Plan, or after Rutyna’s death,\nwhen it received the PSA in April 2002. Regardless of notice, we\nreach the same conclusion – that Files simply engaged the statutorily\ncontemplated process to “qualify” the PSA as a QDRO in order to\nenforce pre-existing rights. Nothing in the statute, or in our\nprecedent, requires that a QDRO be in place prior to the death of a\nplan participant when the QDRO that is ultimately obtained by\nengaging the statutory process simply seeks to enforce a separate\ninterest in a pension benefit that existed before the death of the plan\nparticipant.
