Robinson alleges that she was sexually\nharassed by appellee James Dickerson (her supervisor) and\nthat appellees Craig Edwards (an assistant police chief) and\nEarl Buford (the chief of police) knew of the harassment but\nfailed to take action to stop it. Robinson asserted a variety\nof claims under both federal and state law against\nDickerson, Edwards, Buford, and the City. At the close of\nplaintiffs' case, the district court granted defendants'\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on several of\nRobinson's claims. The jury returned verdicts for\ndefendants on the claims that remained. In this appeal,\nplaintiffs challenge the grant of judgment as a matter of\nlaw, a jury instruction, and certain evidentiary rulings. We\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n\nI.\n\nRobinson began working as a Pittsburgh police officer in\n1990. Hawthorne, her husband, also worked as a police\nofficer for the City. In January 1992, Robinson was\nassigned to a drug suppression unit commanded by then-\n\n                    2\n\fLieutenant Dickerson. Hawthorne worked in the same unit\nuntil June 1992, and Robinson contends that after he left\nto begin a new assignment, Dickerson began sexually\nharassing her. According to Robinson, the harassment\nincluded unhooking her bra, snapping her bra strap,\ntouching her hair and ears, telling her \"you stink pretty,\"\nmaking comments about the size of her breasts, blowing\nher a kiss, asking her out for a drink, touching her leg\nunder a table, putting his hands around her waist,\ndropping his keys down the back of her shirt and\nattempting to retrieve them, and describing the position in\nwhich he and Robinson would have sex if they were to do\nso. Robinson testified that she never acceded to any of\nDickerson's sexual advances or reciprocated any of his\nsexual remarks and that she made it clear to him that his\nconduct was unwelcome.\n\nIn the fall of 1992, Robinson approached Assistant Chief\nEdwards to inquire about a transfer to the detective bureau\n(which would have been a promotion). Edwards had no\ndirect supervisory authority over Robinson, but was one of\ntwo second-in-command officers who reported directly to\nChief Buford. (App. 89-90; 585-86) Robinson testified that\nshe told Edwards that she thought Dickerson \"was hitting\non [her]\" and \"coming on to [her].\" (App. 146-47) She said\nthat Edwards advised her to \"wait it out\" because he\nthought that Chief Buford might be leaving soon for\nanother job. Edwards reportedly said that Buford might\ntake Dickerson with him and that even if Dickerson\nremained, Buford's departure would allow Edwards to\nobtain power over Dickerson. (App. 147) Until then,\nhowever, Edwards allegedly told Robinson he could not do\nanything about Dickerson because Buford protected him.\n(App. 147-48) In addition, according to Robinson, Edwards\ntold her that Buford would not do anything to help her\nbecause Dickerson \"had done this before\" and Buford had\nnot done anything following that incident. (App. 148)\nRobinson testified that she believed \"waiting it out\" was a\n\"viable solution\" and that she did not tell her husband\nabout the harassment or do anything else about it at the\ntime. (App. 149)1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In addition to this request, Robinson sought a transfer to the detective\nbureau on several other occasions, but she never succeeded in obtaining\nsuch a transfer.\n\n                    3\n\fIn May 1993, Robinson wrote a letter to Buford in which\nshe asked to meet with him. According to Robinson, her\noriginal draft of the letter, prepared in March or April 1993,\nstated that Dickerson was \"coming on to [her]\" and that she\nthought that this was \"the reason for [her] now bad\nreputation.\" (App. 168) Robinson recounted that she gave\nthe letter to Edwards to look over and that Edwards told\nher that she could not send the letter through the chain of\ncommand because it was too \"specific in detail.\" According\nto Robinson, Edwards recommended that she \"just be\nspecific about requesting a meeting.\" (App. 166-67) The\noriginal draft was never introduced in evidence. The letter\nthat was actually sent to Buford requested a meeting in\norder to discuss \"career goals\" and \"past conflicts\" and to\n\"seek guidance with future endeavors.\" The letter made no\nmention of sexual harassment. Upon receipt of the letter,\nBuford returned it to Robinson with a notation that it\nneeded to be transmitted through the proper chain of\ncommand rather than sent directly to him.\n\nIn January 1994, Robinson was detailed to the criminal\nintelligence unit, where her direct supervisor was Sergeant\nWilliam Bochter and her second-line supervisor was Chief\nBuford. In this assignment, neither Dickerson nor Edwards\npossessed any supervisory authority over Robinson. In May\n1994, Robinson met with Edwards, told him she was \"fed\nup\" with the harassment, and stated her intention to file a\ncomplaint. She testified that Edwards recommended that\nshe file a complaint with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").\n\nA few weeks later, Robinson filed a complaint with\nBochter, who forwarded it to Buford on May 31, 1994. On\nJune 1, 1994, Robinson filed a complaint with the EEOC\nalleging that Dickerson had sexually harassed her, and on\nJuly 6, 1994, she filed a similar complaint with the Bureau\nof Police Office of Professional Standards (\"OPS\"). OPS's\ninvestigation, which was completed in September 1994,\nconcluded that probable cause existed to substantiate\nRobinson's claim.2 In October 1994, Robinson stopped\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The district court did not allow the OPS report itself to be introduced\nin evidence, but it permitted the investigating officer, Carla Gedman, to\ntestify as to her conclusions on the ground that they were admissions by\na party-opponent and thus not hearsay.\n\n                    4\n\freporting for work, and she has not returned to her job\nsince that time. She was nonetheless promoted to sergeant\nin February 1995.\n\nII.\n\nIn August 1994, Robinson and Hawthorne filed suit in\ndistrict court against the City, Buford, Edwards, and\nDickerson. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), Robinson asserted claims against\nthe City for hostile work environment and quid pro quo\nsexual harassment and for retaliation, as well as a claim for\nhostile work environment sexual harassment against\nDickerson. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, she asserted claims,\nbased on alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause,\nagainst all four defendants. She claimed that all four were\nresponsible for unconstitutional sex-based discrimination\nand that all but Dickerson were liable for unlawful\nretaliation. In addition, Robinson asserted claims under\nPennsylvania law for assault, battery, and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress against Dickerson. Robinson\nsought punitive damages on all claims. Hawthorne sued\nDickerson under Pennsylvania law for loss of consortium.\nDickerson counter-claimed against Robinson for\ndefamation.\n\nAt the close of plaintiffs' case, defendants moved for\njudgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n50(a). The district court granted defendants' motion as to\nthe Title VII hostile work environment claim against\nDickerson because individuals cannot be liable under that\nstatute. See Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co.,\n100 F.3d 1061, 1077-78 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc). The court\ngranted the motion as to all of Robinson's § 1983 claims\nagainst the City on the ground that there was insufficient\nevidence of an unconstitutional policy or custom.\nFurthermore, with respect to the Title VII retaliation claim\nagainst the City (and in the alternative with respect to the\n§ 1983 retaliation claim against the City, Buford, and\nEdwards), the court held that Robinson had not shown a\ncausal link between her protected activity and any adverse\nemployment action. The court granted the motion with\nrespect to Robinson's Title VII quid pro quo claim against\n\n                    5\n\fthe City because the court found insufficient evidence that\na job benefit or detriment was conditioned upon Robinson's\nresponse to Dickerson's advances or that her response to\nhis advances in fact affected a tangible aspect of her\nemployment. Moreover, the court granted defendants'\nmotion as to the § 1983 claims against Buford and Edwards\non the ground that there was insufficient evidence that\neither was personally involved in any deprivation of\nRobinson's rights (as well as, with respect to the retaliation\ntheory, on the alternative ground described above). Finally,\nthe court granted the motion as to the intentional infliction\nclaim against Dickerson and struck Robinson's demand for\npunitive damages on all claims because there was\ninsufficient evidence of outrageous conduct.\n\nThe claims that went to the jury were thus as follows: (1)\nthe Title VII hostile work environment claim against the\nCity; (2) the § 1983 sex discrimination claim against\nDickerson; (3) the assault and battery claims against\nDickerson; (4) Hawthorne's loss of consortium claim against\nDickerson; and (5) Dickerson's defamation counter-claim.\nThe jury returned verdicts for the defense on all of\nplaintiffs' claims, as well as a verdict for Robinson on the\ncounter-claim.\n\nRobinson appeals from the grant of judgment as a matter\nof law on all claims except the Title VII and intentional\ninfliction claims against Dickerson.3 In addition, she\ncontests certain evidentiary rulings and a jury instruction\nthat allegedly affected the jury's rejection of the claims that\nit was permitted to consider. Nothing is at issue in this\nappeal with respect to the defamation counter-claim, the\nassault and battery claims, or the loss of consortium claim.\n\nWe exercise plenary review over the district court's grant\nof judgment as a matter of law. Delli Santi v. CNA Ins. Co.,\n88 F.3d 192, 200 (3d Cir. 1996). \"Our role is to determine\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. Robinson's statement of issues includes the question whether the\ncourt properly granted judgment as a matter of law on what she\ndescribes as her \"claim\" for punitive damages, Appellants' Br. at 2, but\nher brief does not mention this issue. She has therefore waived it.\nPennsylvania v. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 101 F.3d 939, 945\n(3d Cir. 1996).\n\n                     6\n\fwhether the evidence and justifiable inferences most\nfavorable to the [non-moving] party [would have] afford[ed]\nany rational basis\" for a verdict in favor of the non-moving\nparty. Id. (quotation omitted). We exercise plenary review\nover the jury instructions given by the district court in\norder to determine whether, read as a whole, the\ninstructions stated the correct legal standard. Miller v.\nCIGNA Corp., 47 F.3d 586, 591 (3d Cir. 1995) (en banc).\nFinally, we review the district court's decisions to admit or\nexclude evidence for abuse of discretion, Glass v.\nPhiladelphia Elec. Co., 34 F.3d 188, 191 (3d Cir. 1994),\nalthough our review is plenary as to the interpretation or\napplication of a legal standard underlying such a decision.\nWest v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 45 F.3d 744, 752 (3d Cir.\n1995). We will not reverse on the basis of an erroneous\ndecision to admit or exclude evidence unless the error\naffected a \"substantial right\" of the aggrieved party. Id.\n\nIII.\n\nSection 1983 Equal Protection Claim Against Buford,\nEdwards, and the City\n\nTo prevail on her § 1983 equal protection claim, Robinson\nwas required to prove that she was subjected to \"purposeful\ndiscrimination\" because of her sex. Keenan v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 983 F.2d 459, 465 (3d Cir. 1993). Moreover,\nto hold Buford or Edwards liable under § 1983 for such an\nequal protection violation, Robinson was required to prove\nthat they personally \"participated in violating [her] rights,\n. . . that [they] directed others to violate them, or that [they]\n. . . had knowledge of and acquiesced in [their]\nsubordinates' violations.\" Baker v. Monroe Twp., 50 F.3d\n1186, 1190-91 (3d Cir. 1995). See also Andrews v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 895 F.2d 1469, 1478 (3d Cir. 1990). Robinson\ndoes not contend that either Buford or Edwards personally\nengaged in any discriminatory conduct against her or that\nthey directed anyone else to do so. Rather, her argument is\nthat Buford and Edwards were aware of and acquiesced in\nDickerson's sexual harassment. We must thus determine,\ntaking Robinson's evidence as true and giving her the\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences, what Edwards and\n\n                     7\n\fBuford knew about the harassment, when they learned\nabout it, and what, if anything, they did in response.\n\nA. Robinson does not seek to hold Edwards liable for\nanything that he did or did not do following her May 1994\ncomplaint. Rather, she contends that she told Edwards in\n1992 that Dickerson was \"hitting on [her]\" and that\nEdwards \"acquiesced\" in Dickerson's conduct because he\ndid not take any action to stop Dickerson but instead told\nRobinson to \"wait it out\" because Buford and/or Dickerson\nmight soon be changing jobs.\n\nEdwards responds that the jury's verdict for the City on\nRobinson's Title VII hostile work environment claim\nconclusively establishes that he cannot be liable under\n§ 1983 for acquiescing in her subjection to a hostile\nenvironment. If there was no hostile environment in the\nfirst place, Edwards's argument goes, then he logically\ncannot be liable for knowingly acquiescing in the existence\nof one. We reject this argument because, among other\nthings, it ignores the fact that the jury's verdict does not\nnecessarily mean that it found that Robinson was not\nsubjected to a hostile work environment. Instead, the jury\nmight have rejected her Title VII hostile work environment\nclaim on the ground that the City had an effective policy\nagainst sexual harassment. See, e.g., Bouton v. BMW of N.\nAm., Inc., 29 F.3d 103, 110 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\nWe agree with Edwards, however, that there was\ninsufficient evidence to show that he knew of and\nacquiesced in Dickerson's alleged sexual harassment. It is\ntrue that the jury could have found that Edwards knew in\n1992 that Dickerson was \"hitting on\" Robinson and that\nEdwards did not take any action to stop Dickerson's\nconduct. But it is undisputed that, while Edwards had a\nhigher rank than Dickerson, he possessed no actual\nsupervisory authority over him. (App. 1031-32) Regardless\nof whether the evidence presented by Robinson would be\nadequate if Edwards had actual supervisory authority over\nDickerson, we do not believe that Edwards can be held\nliable under § 1983 for failing to take action to correct the\nbehavior of an individual over whom he had no actual\ncontrol.\n\n                    8\n\f\"A defendant in a [§ 1983] action must have personal\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs.\" Rode v. Dellarciprete,\n845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988) (emphasis added). See\nalso, e.g., Andrews, 895 F.2d at 1478 (\"there must be some\naffirmative conduct by the supervisor that played a role in\nthe discrimination\") (citing Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362,\n377 (1976)). Our cases have held that \"actual knowledge\nand acquiescence\" suffices for supervisory liability because\nit can be equated with \"personal direction\" and \"direct\ndiscrimination by the supervisor.\" Id. (quoting Rode, 845\nF.2d at 1207). Where a supervisor with authority over a\nsubordinate knows that the subordinate is violating\nsomeone's rights but fails to act to stop the subordinate\nfrom doing so, the factfinder may usually infer that the\nsupervisor \"acquiesced\" in (i.e., tacitly assented to or\naccepted) the subordinate's conduct.4 But where actual\nsupervisory authority is lacking, mere inaction, in most\ncircumstances, does not reasonably give rise to a similar\ninference. As a general matter, a person who fails to act to\ncorrect the conduct of someone over whom he or she has\nno supervisory authority cannot fairly be said to have\n\"acquiesced\" in the latter's conduct.\n\nGeneral tort principles provide a useful analogy. Unless a\n\"master\"-\"servant\" relationship exists, the circumstances in\nwhich one person may be held liable for a tort committed\nby another are quite limited, see Restatement (Second) of\nTorts §§ 876-878 (1977), and none appears to be applicable\nhere. A claim against a \"master\" based on a tort committed\nby a \"servant\" bears a resemblance to a § 1983 claim\nagainst a government supervisor based on a constitutional\ntort committed by a subordinate,5 but a person cannot be\na \"master\" unless he or she has \"the right to control the\nphysical conduct\" of the servant. Restatement (Second) of\nAgency § 2(1) (1957). By analogy, we hold that, except\nperhaps in unusual circumstances, a government official or\nemployee who lacks supervisory authority over the person\nwho commits a constitutional tort cannot be held, based on\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 18 (1971); Random\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged Ed. 13 (1967).\n\n5. We do not suggest, however, that all rules applicable to the former\ntype of claim may be applied by analogy to the latter.\n\n                    9\n\fmere inaction,6 to have \"acquiesced\" in the unconstitutional\nconduct.\n\nHere, it is clear that Edwards did not control or have the\nright to control Dickerson's physical conduct in the\nperformance of his job, and Edwards is thus not liable for\nDickerson's conduct.7 Accordingly, we affirm the district\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Of course, if the government official or employee had sufficient\npersonal involvement in the constitutional tort, he or she may be held\nliable. In this context, the rules set out in §§ 876 and 877(a) of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts provide useful guidance. Section 876\nstates:\n\nFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of\nanother, one is subject to liability if he\n\n(a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a\ncommon design with him, or\n\n(b) knows that the other's conduct constitutes a b reach of duty\nand gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so\nto conduct himself, or\n\n(c) gives substantial assistance to the other in a ccomplishing a\ntortious result and his own conduct, separately considered,\nconstitutes a breach of duty to the third person.\n\nSection 877(a) provides:\n\nFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of\nanother, one is subject to liability if he\n\n(a) orders or induces the conduct, if he knows or should know of\ncircumstances that would make the conduct tortious if it were his\nown . . . .\n\n7. All of our prior cases discussing the issue of supervisory liability for\n\"acquiescence\" involved defendants who had actual authority to control\nthe conduct of the person alleged to have violated the plaintiff's rights.\nOur decision here is thus fully consistent with our holdings in those\ncases.\n\nFor example, in Baker, 50 F.3d at 1193-94, we held that the officer\nwho was in charge of a drug raid could be liable under § 1983 for certain\nallegedly illegal actions taken by the officers under his command where\nthere was \"sufficient evidence to permit an inference that [the\ncommanding officer] knew of and acquiesced in the treatment the\n[plaintiffs] were receiving at the hands of the other officers acting under\n\n                    10\n\fcourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law to Edwards on\nRobinson's § 1983 equal protection claim.\n\nB. Robinson argues that Buford is liable under§ 1983\nfor Dickerson's conduct because Buford \"took absolutely no\naction to remedy Robinson's situation, and the evidence\nsuggests that he thought Dickerson's conduct a joke.\"\nAppellants' Br. at 22. We disagree, because we are unable\nto find any evidence that Buford had any knowledge of any\nalleged harassment before May 1994. (As with Edwards,\nRobinson does not argue that Buford is liable based on\nanything he did or failed to do following her May 1994\ncomplaint.)\n\nRobinson testified that Edwards told her in 1992 that it\nwould not serve any purpose for him to forward her\ncomplaint to Buford because Buford would not take it\nseriously. It seems most doubtful that Edwards's statement\nwould have been admissible at trial against Buford, but in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nhis supervision.\" 50 F.3d at 1193. The commanding officer indisputedly\nhad the authority to control the conduct of the officers under his\ncommand.\n\nIn Keenan, 983 F.2d at 465-68, the plaintiffs alleged that they were\ntransferred in retaliation for protected activity, and the jury agreed. We\nheld that four supervisors could be liable under § 1983 where they knew\nof the plaintiffs' protected activity and approved the transfers anyway. Id.\nat 468. We concluded that \"the evidence [was] sufficient to establish that\nthe plaintiffs were impermissibly disciplined by [the four supervisors] for\nconduct that constituted protected activity.\" Id. Keenan is\ndistinguishable because the four supervisors approved the transfers and\npossessed formal authority over their respective subordinates who\nrecommended the transfers.\n\nIn Andrews, 895 F.2d at 1478-79, the supervisors not only had direct\nauthority over the primary harassers but also were personally involved\nin the unconstitutional conduct. We upheld a verdict against one\nsupervisor who \"personally participated in\" and \"condoned\" the\nharassment perpetrated by other officers under his supervision. As to\nanother supervisor, \"the man who was ultimately responsible for the\nconduct of the Division,\" we held that the evidence supported the jury's\nfinding that he was aware of the harassment and not only did nothing\nto stop it, but told the plaintiff that \"you have to expect this working\nwith the guys.\" Id. at 1479.\n\n                    11\n\fany event this statement in no way tends to show that\nBuford in fact was aware in 1992 that Dickerson was\nsexually harassing Robinson. The uncontradicted evidence\nshows that Buford first learned of Robinson's complaint\nwhen Bochter told him about it on May 31, 1994. We\ntherefore affirm the district court's grant of judgment as a\nmatter of law to Buford on Robinson's § 1983 equal\nprotection claim.\n\nC. Our conclusion that Buford is not liable under\n§ 1983 for Dickerson's alleged sexual harassment requires\nus to reject as well Robinson's submission that the City is\nliable under § 1983 for Dickerson's alleged sexual\nharassment. The City, as a municipality, is not liable\nthrough respondeat superior for the constitutional torts of\nits employees. Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S.\n658 (1978). Municipal liability attaches only \"when\nexecution of a government's policy or custom, whether\nmade by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts\nmay fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the\ninjury\" complained of. Id. at 694. As we explained in\nAndrews:\n\nA government policy or custom can be established in\none of two ways. Policy is made when a decisionmaker\npossess[ing] final authority to establish municipal\npolicy with respect to the action issues an official\nproclamation, policy, or edict. A course of conduct is\nconsidered to be a \"custom\" when, though not\nauthorized by law, such practices of state officials [are]\nso permanent and well-settled as to virtually constitute\nlaw.\n\n895 F.2d at 1480 (quotations omitted) (emendations in\noriginal).\n\nRobinson does not argue that the City is liable because\nit maintained a \"custom\" of permitting sexual harassment.\nRather, she asserts that the City is liable through Buford,\nwho is concededly a policymaker whose conduct is\nattributable to the City. In accordance with our holding\nthat Buford is not liable under § 1983 for Dickerson's\nalleged sexual harassment, we conclude that the City\nlikewise is not liable under § 1983. We therefore affirm the\n\n                    12\n\fdistrict court's grant of judgment as a matter of law to the\nCity on Robinson's § 1983 equal protection claim.\n\nIV.\n\nTitle VII Quid Pro Quo Sexual Harassment Claim\nAgainst the City\n\nIn addition to claiming that Dickerson's sexual\nharassment created a hostile work environment, Robinson\nalleged that Dickerson engaged in quid pro quo sexual\nharassment, for which the City was liable under Title VII.\nThe district court granted judgment as a matter of law for\nthe City on this claim, but we hold that Robinson presented\nsufficient evidence to go to the jury on this claim.8\n\nA. This court has not yet had occasion to consider the\nelements of a quid pro quo claim, but we agree with the\nformulation set out in 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(1) and (2),\nwhich provides:\n\nUnwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual\nfavors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual\nnature constitute sexual harassment when (1)\nsubmission to such conduct is made either explicitly or\nimplicitly a term or condition of an individual's\nemployment [or] (2) submission to or rejection of such\nconduct by an individual is used as the basis for\nemployment decisions affecting such individuals. . ..\n\nSee also, e.g., Heyne v. Caruso , 69 F.3d 1475, 1478 (9th\nCir. 1995); Cram v. Lanson & Sessions, 49 F.3d 466, 473\n(8th Cir. 1995); Karibian v. Columbia University , 14 F.3d\n773, 777 (2d Cir. 1994); Martin v. Nannie and the\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n8. We reject at the outset defendants' contention that there is no\nevidence that Dickerson ever made a sexual advance to Robinson. The\nrecord is replete with evidence of implicit sexual advances, so we take\ndefendants to mean that only an explicit request for sex qualifies as a\nsexual advance. We disagree. We note simply that the evidence\npreviously summarized concerning Dickerson's alleged statements and\nactions would have entitled the jury to find that Dickerson made sexual\nadvances to Robinson.\n\n                    13\n\fNewborns, Inc., 3 F.3d 1410, 1416 (10th Cir. 1993); Lipsett\nv. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 898 (1st Cir. 1988).9\n\nUnder this test, the consequences attached to an\nemployee's response to the sexual advances must be\nsufficiently severe as to alter the employee's \"compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges of employment,\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1), or to \"deprive or tend to deprive [him or\nher] of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely\naffect his [or her] status as an employee.\" 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(2). This does not mean that the employee must\nbe threatened with or must experience \" `economic' or\n`tangible' discrimination.\" Meritor, 477 U.S. at 64. See also\nHarris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21 (1993). But\nby the same token, not every insult, slight, or\nunpleasantness gives rise to a valid Title VII claim. In\nMeritor, the Supreme Court noted that \"not all workplace\nconduct that may be described as `harassment' affects a\n`term, condition, or privilege of employment.' \" 477 U.S. at\n67. The Court also suggested that the \" `mere utterance of\nan ethnic or racial epithet which engenders offensive\nfeelings in an employee' would not affect the conditions of\nemployment to [a] sufficiently significant degree to violate\nTitle VII.\" Id. (quoting Rogers v. EEOC, 454 F.2d 234, 238\n(5th Cir. 1971)). Thus, whether in a hostile work\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n9. Courts have unanimously held that an employer is strictly liable for\nquid pro quo harassment by a supervisor having actual or apparent\nauthority to carry out the threat or promise that is made to the victim.\nSee Karibian, 14 F.3d at 777. See also Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson,\n477 U.S. 57, 76 (1986) (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"every\nCourt of Appeals that has considered the issue has held that sexual\nharassment by supervisory personnel is automatically imputed to the\nemployer when the harassment results in tangible detriment to the\nsubordinate employee\"). This rule differs from that which applies in a\nhostile work environment case. See Bouton v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 29\nF.3d 103, 106-07 (3d Cir. 1994). This distinction has been criticized,\nsee, e.g., J. Hoult Verkerke, Notice Liability in Employment Discrimination\nLaw, 81 Va. L. Rev. 273, 277 (1995), but since the parties here have not\naddressed the issue, we assume that the City would be liable for any\nquid pro quo sexual harassment committed by Dickerson. Cf. Bouton, 29\nF.3d at 106-07 (stating, in a case involving only a hostile environment\nclaim, that \"[w]ithout the agency relationship, quid pro quo harassment\nwould be impossible, so the employer is responsible\").\n\n                   14\n\fenvironment case or a quid pro quo case, objectionable\nconduct attributable to an employer is not always sufficient\nto alter an employee's terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment and is thus not always sufficient to violate\nTitle VII.\n\nSubsections (1) and (2) of 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a) differ in\nthat subsection (1) addresses cases in which an employee\nis told beforehand that his or her compensation or some\nother term, condition, or privilege of employment will be\naffected by his or her response to the unwelcome sexual\nadvances, whereas subsection (2) addresses cases in which\nthe employee's response to sexual advances is thereafter\nused as a basis for a decision concerning compensation,\netc. Under subsection (1), a quid pro quo violation occurs\nat the time when an employee is told that his or her\ncompensation, etc. is dependent upon submission to\nunwelcome sexual advances. At that point, the employee\nhas been subjected to discrimination because of sex. (This\nis so, of course, because, if the employee had been a\nmember of the opposite sex, his or her compensation, etc.\npresumably would not have been made dependent on\nsubmission.) Whether the employee thereafter submits to or\nrebuffs the advances, a violation has nevertheless occurred.\nLike the Second Circuit, we \"do not read Title VII to punish\nthe victims of sexual harassment who surrender to\nunwelcome sexual encounters. . . . The supervisor's\nconduct is equally unlawful under Title VII whether the\nemployee submits or not.\" Karibian, 14 F.3d at 778.10\n\nSimilarly, there is a violation under subsection (1) even if\nthe employee rebuffs the advances and his or her\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment are not in fact altered, i.e., even if the\nsupervisor does not follow through on his or her threat. The\nthreat is sufficient to constitute \"discriminat[ion] . . . with\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Whether the employee \"submi[tted] to the supervisor's advances is\ncertainly relevant\" because it bears on \"the issue whether the sexual\nadvances were unwelcome, not whether unwelcome sexual advances\nwere unlawful.\" Karibian, 14 F.3d at 779. In this case, it is undisputed\nthat Robinson refused to submit to Dickerson's alleged advances, and it\nis clear that the jury would have been entitled tofind that the advances\nwere unwelcome.\n\n                    15\n\frespect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of . . . sex.\" 11 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1). But see Gary v. Long, 59 F.3d 1391, 1396\n(D.C. Cir. 1995).\n\nUnder subsection (2), a plaintiff must make a showing\nthat differs significantly from that required under\nsubsection (1). Under subsection (2), the plaintiff must\nshow that his or her response to unwelcome advances was\nsubsequently used as a basis for a decision about\ncompensation, etc. Thus, the plaintiff need not show that\nsubmission was linked to compensation, etc. at or before\nthe time when the advances occurred. But the employee\nmust show that his or her response was in fact used\nthereafter as a basis for a decision affecting his or her\ncompensation, etc.\n\nB. Robinson contends that Dickerson linked her\nresponse to his advances to the job detriments of \"a bad\nreputation at work\" and \"unjust reprimands.\" Appellants'\nBr. at 28-29. Robinson explains that \"[m]any times after\nRobinson would reject him, Dickerson unjustifiably\nreprimanded her in a very harsh manner and in front of\nother officers; he continuously bothered her at work, even\nwhen she was not under his direct command; he phoned\nher at home and work for reasons unrelated to police\nbusiness; and he made negative comments to her regarding\nher work and her marriage.\" Appellants' Br. at 29 (citations\nomitted).\n\nWe are not persuaded that these alleged actions, even\nwhen taken together, rose to the level of conduct affecting\nRobinson's \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\"\nof employment. Formal reprimands that result in a notation\nin an employee's personnel file could be sufficiently\nconcrete, but harsh words that lack real consequences are\nnot. See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67.\n\nWe reach a different conclusion with respect to\nRobinson's allegation that Dickerson blocked her transfer to\nthe detective bureau because she refused to accede to his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The fact that no adverse action was taken is of course relevant to the\nquestion whether a threat or promise was made.\n\n                    16\n\fadvances. The record before us would certainly permit the\nconclusion that Robinson was denied a transfer to the\ndetective bureau (which would have been a promotion)\nbecause she had performed unsatisfactorily in two\nundercover assignments, because she was unable to accept\ncriticism or take direction, or for other valid work-related\nreasons. However, we believe that the record would also\nsupport a finding that Dickerson refused to recommend her\ntransfer because she rebuffed his advances. It is\nundisputed that a supervisor's recommendation weighs\nvery heavily in determining who is transferred, so the jury\ncould conclude that Dickerson's refusal to recommend\nRobinson cost her the transfer. Accordingly, the evidence\nwas sufficient to support a finding of quid pro quo\nharassment within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(2).12\n\nRobinson testified that Dickerson told her on several\noccasions that he would recommend her for transfer to the\ndetective bureau (App. 111, 113-14, 121-22, 142, 160-61),\nbut that after a party at which Dickerson touched her leg\nunder the table and pulled her into a compromising\nposition for a photograph, he responded to her renewed\ninquiry about the transfer by telling her that \"he had talked\nto the Chief and he had talked to other detectives, and they\nhad all said I had a bad attitude,\" implying that this was\nthe reason she had not been transferred. (App. 143) She\nalso testified that, when she spoke to Edwards shortly\nthereafter, he confirmed that Dickerson had \"been saying\nbad things about [her] lately to Buford and [him].\" (App.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Robinson has not called to our attention any admissible evidence\nthat Dickerson explicitly threatened her before or at the time he made a\nsexual advance that her response would affect her \"compensation, terms,\nconditions, or privileges\" of employment. See 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(1).\nIn light of our conclusion that the evidence is sufficient to show that\nDickerson in fact did use Robinson's response to his advances as a basis\nfor a decision affecting her compensation, etc. within the meaning of\nsubsection (2), we need not consider whether the evidence would support\na finding that Dickerson imposed such a condition \"implicitly\" before or\nat the time he made the alleged advances within the meaning of\nsubsection (1). On remand, the district court should decide whether\nRobinson can proceed to trial based only on the theory of quid pro quo\nharassment set out in 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(2) or whether she can rely\non 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(1) as well.\n\n                   17\n\f145) When she asked Edwards how she should deal with\nthat and told him that \"none of it [what Dickerson had been\nsaying] was true,\" he replied, \"I know. I know Jim is like\nthat. . . . Jimmy thinks he's a lover.\" (App. 146) Moreover,\nwhen Robinson asked Edwards why he thought Dickerson\nwas saying bad things about her, Edwards said that\n\"Dickerson would like to have nothing better than a 23-\nyear-old girl like you.\" (App. 146) Robinson testified that,\nafter Dickerson told her again in April 1993 that she would\nbe transferred, Edwards \"told [her] that he [didn't] know\nwhy Commander Dickerson said he was going to\nrecommend [her], because he [Dickerson] made sure that\n[she] wasn't on that [March 1993 transfer] list.\" (App. 162)\n\nWe hold that this evidence is sufficient to entitle a\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that Robinson was denied\na transfer to the detective bureau because she refused\nDickerson's advances. We believe that, in contrast to minor\nslights like \"negative comments,\" receiving or being denied\na desired promotion is sufficiently serious and tangible to\nconstitute a change in the employee's \"terms, conditions, or\nprivileges\" of employment.13 If the jury finds that Robinson\nwas subjected to unwelcome sexual advances and that her\nresponse to those advances was the basis for Dickerson's\nrefusal to recommend her for such a transfer, Robinson will\nhave proved that the City, through Dickerson,\ndiscriminated against her because of her sex with respect\nto the \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\" of\nher employment. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Accordingly, we\nreverse the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of\nlaw to the City on Robinson's claim under Title VII for quid\npro quo sexual harassment.14\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Here, although the transfer at issue would have been a promotion,\nRobinson has not directed us to any specific evidence that the transfer\nwould have increased her compensation. Paragraph 43 of her complaint\ndoes allege that a \"transfer to the position of detective from the position\nof patrolman . . . is a promotion and carries with it an increase in\nannual compensation . . . .\" (App. 27) Moreover, there appears to have\nbeen a stipulation between the parties with respect to the difference in\npay between the detective level and the patrolman level. (App. 1310)\n\n14. The jury returned a verdict for Dickerson on Robinson's claim under\n§ 1983 against Dickerson for discriminating against her because of her\n\n                    18\n\fV.\n\nTitle VII and § 1983 Retaliation Claims Against the City,\nBuford, and Edwards\n\nRobinson contends that, after she filed her complaint\nwith the EEOC, she suffered reprisals at work. Section\n704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), makes it \"an\nunlawful employment practice\" for \"an employer\" to\n\"discriminate\" against an employee \"because he [the\nemployee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding,\nor hearing under [Title VII].\" Robinson sued the City for\nretaliation under the above-quoted provision of Title VII.\nShe also sued Buford and Edwards for retaliation under\n§ 1983, apparently for violating her right, secured by the\nsame provision of Title VII, to protest discrimination.\n\nIn Nelson v. Upsala College, 51 F.3d 383 (3d Cir. 1995),\nwe set forth the elements of a retaliation claim:\n\nTo establish discriminatory retaliation under Title VII,\na plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) she engaged in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nsex, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Since this claim was\nallowed to go the jury after the court granted judgment as a matter of\nlaw on Robinson's quid pro quo and retaliation theories, it would appear\nthat this claim was founded upon a hostile work environment theory. It\nis unclear from the record before us whether this claim was also founded\nupon a theory of quid pro quo harassment. If it was, our discussion in\nthis section applies equally to it, and it should be tried on remand along\nwith Robinson's Title VII quid pro quo claim against the City. (Unlike\nwith respect to the § 1983 claims against Buford, Edwards, and the City,\nthere is no legal issue regarding Dickerson's personal liability under\n§ 1983.) We of course recognize that federal pleading rules are liberal,\nbut it could be unfair for Robinson to assert a claim on remand that she\ndid not make clear in the earlier proceedings in the district court.\nCompare Appellants' Br. at 2, 4, 28 (referring to a claim under § 1983 for\nquid pro quo harassment, though apparently only against the City) with\nAppellees' Br. at 22 (noting Robinson's references to a purported § 1983\nclaim for quid pro quo harassment, but stating that the district court\n\"analyzed Robinson's quid pro quo claim under a strict Title VII\nanalysis\"). We leave it to the district court to determine whether on\nremand Robinson should be permitted to pursue a claim against\nDickerson under § 1983 on a quid pro quo theory.\n\n                   19\n\factivity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took an\nadverse employment action against her; and (3) there\nwas a causal connection between her participation in\nthe protected activity and the adverse employment\naction.\n\nId. at 386 (citations omitted). See also Woodson v. Scott\nPaper Co., 109 F.3d 913, 920 (3d Cir. 1997); Kachmar v.\nSunGard Data Systems, Inc., 109 F.3d 173, 177 (3d Cir.\n1997); Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corp., 85 F.3d 1074,\n1085 (3d Cir. 1996); Jalil v. Avdel Corp., 873 F.2d 701, 708\n(3d Cir. 1989) (same); Delli Santi v. CNA Ins. Co., 88 F.3d\n192, 198 (3d Cir. 1996) (same, under New Jersey law).\n\nIt is undisputed that Robinson's EEOC complaint\nconstitutes protected activity under Title VII. The district\ncourt granted judgment as a matter of law to defendants on\nRobinson's retaliation claims on the ground that she had\nnot presented evidence that the alleged reprisals were the\nresult of the protected activity. (App. 1029) On appeal,\nRobinson argues that the court erred in evaluating her\nevidence of retaliation. She submits that she was subjected\nto the following acts of reprisal due to the filing of her\nEEOC complaint:\n\nrestricted job duties, reassignment and subsequent\nfailure to transfer her out of an assignment in which\nshe was under the direct command of the alleged\nharasser, and the issuance of several unsubstantiated\noral reprimands against her. Additionally, she testified\nthat after refuting one of his advances, Dickerson\nsometimes would not talk to her, or would make\nunnecessary derogatory comments to her. . . [Moreover,\nshe testified that] \"Chief Edwards told me that he\ndidn't know why Commander Dickerson said he was\ngoing to recommend me, because he made sure that I\nwasn't on that [transfer] list.\"\n\nAppellants' Br. at 27 (citations omitted).\n\nA. In our view, much of the allegedly retaliatory conduct\nof which Robinson complains, even if her evidence is\nbelieved, does not give rise to a claim for retaliation. The\nalleged \"unsubstantiated oral reprimands\" and\n\"unnecessary derogatory comments\" suffered by Robinson\n\n                    20\n\ffollowing her complaint do not rise to the level of what our\ncases have described as \"adverse employment action.\"\n\nTitle VII declares that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful\nemployment practice for an employer to discriminate\"\nagainst an employee \"because he has made a charge\" of\ndiscrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Title 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a) makes it an \"unlawful employment practice\"\n\nto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\nor otherwise to discriminate against any individual\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual's\n. . . sex . . . or to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees . . . in any way which would deprive or tend\nto deprive any individual of employment opportunities\nor otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual's . . . sex . . . .\n\nRetaliatory conduct other than discharge or refusal to\nrehire is thus proscribed by Title VII only if it alters the\nemployee's \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment,\" deprives him or her of \"employment\nopportunities,\" or \"adversely affect[s] his [or her] status as\nan employee.\" It follows that \"not everything that makes an\nemployee unhappy\" qualifies as retaliation, for\"[o]therwise,\nminor and even trivial employment actions that `an\nirritable, chip-on-the-shoulder employee did not like would\nform the basis of a discrimination suit.' \" Smart v. Ball State\nUniversity, 89 F.3d 437, 441 (7th Cir. 1996) (quoting\nWilliams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., 85 F.3d 270, 274 (7th\nCir. 1996)).\n\nCourts have operationalized the principle that retaliatory\nconduct must be serious and tangible enough to alter an\nemployee's compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment into the doctrinal requirement that the alleged\nretaliation constitute \"adverse employment action.\" See\nWilliams, 85 F.3d at 273 (interpreting parallel provisions of\nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act to require\n\"materially adverse action\"); McDonnell v. Cisneros, 84 F.3d\n256, 258 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"The language of `materially\nadverse employment action' that some courts employ in\nretaliation cases is a paraphrase of Title VII's basic\n\n                    21\n\fprohibition against employment discrimination, found in 42\nU.S.C. §§ 2000e-2(a)(1) and (2).\"). Accordingly, just as we\nconcluded that a quid pro quo plaintiff must show a \"quo\"\nthat is serious enough to alter his or her \"compensation,\nterms, conditions, or privileges\" of employment, we hold\nthat the \"adverse employment action\" element of a\nretaliation plaintiff's prima facie case incorporates the\nsame requirement that the retaliatory conduct rise to the\nlevel of a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1) or (2).15\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n15. In Nelson v. Upsala College, 51 F.3d 383 (3d Cir. 1995), the plaintiff,\na former employee of Upsala, contended that Upsala retaliated against\nher by requiring that she obtain prior approval before going onto\nUpsala's campus. We observed that 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a) \"interdicts `an\nunlawful employment practice' rather than conduct in general which the\nformer employee finds objectionable,\" id. at 388, and rejected the\nplaintiff's argument on the ground that the allegedly retaliatory action\n\"had no impact on any employment relationship that Nelson had, or\nmight have in the future.\" Id. at 389. In Charlton v. Paramus Bd. of\nEducation, 25 F.3d 194 (3d Cir. 1994), we held that a former employee\ncould state a claim for retaliation arising out of post-employment\nconduct, so long as the retaliation affected the plaintiff's future\nemployment opportunities. Id. at 200-01. We noted that retaliation\nclaims have been permitted \"where the retaliation results in discharge\nfrom a later job, a refusal to hire the plaintiff, or other professional or\noccupational harm.\" Id. at 200.\n\nAlthough the instant case does not require us to resolve the issue, it\nappears from our decisions in Nelson and Charlton that a plaintiff who\nclaims that the alleged retaliation prejudiced his or her ability to obtain\nor keep future employment would meet the standard we announce today\nby showing that the retaliatory conduct was related to his or her future\nemployment and was serious enough to materially alter his or her future\nemployment prospects or conditions. See, e.g., Smith v. St. Louis\nUniversity, 109 F.3d 1261, 1266 (8th Cir. 1997) (negative references\ncausing potential employers to decline to hire plaintiff constitute\nactionable retaliation); Ruedlinger v. Jarrett , 106 F.3d 212, 214 (7th Cir.\n1997) (providing information to subsequent employer that caused it to\nfire plaintiff constitutes retaliation that \"impinge[s] on her `future\nemployment prospects or otherwise ha[s] a nexus to employment' \")\n(quoting Veprinsky v. Fluor Daniel, Inc., 87 F.3d 881, 891 (7th Cir.\n1996)); Passer v. American Chemical Society, 935 F.2d 322, 331 (D.C.\nCir. 1991) (under parallel provision of the ADEA, holding that\ndefendant's retaliatory cancellation of a seminar planned in honor of\nplaintiff gave rise to retaliation claim because the cancellation humiliated\n\n                    22\n\fWe hold that Robinson's allegations that she was\nsubjected to \"unsubstantiated oral reprimands\" and\n\"unnecessary derogatory comments\" following her\ncomplaint do not rise to the level of the \"adverse\nemployment action\" required for a retaliation claim. See\nWanamaker v. Columbia Rope Co., 108 F.3d 462, 465-66\n(2d Cir. 1997) (\"barring a terminated employee from using\nan office and phone to conduct a job hunt presents only a\nminor, ministerial stumbling block toward securing future\nemployment\" and thus did not constitute adverse\nemployment action under parallel provisions of the ADEA);\nVeprinsky, 87 F.3d at 895 (former employer's subsidizing of\nattorney for an individual sued by plaintiff was \"entirely\nunrelated to employment\" and resulted in \"too intangible\"\nadversity to plaintiff and thus could not give rise to a\nretaliation claim); Williams, 85 F.3d at 274 (lateral transfer\ninvolving small indirect effect on employee's earnings from\ncommissions \"cannot rise to the level of a materially\nadverse employment action\"). See also McDonnell, 84 F.3d\nat 258 (implying in dicta that \"anger, irritation, dirty looks,\neven the silent treatment can cause distress\" but do not\nconstitute materially adverse employment action); Harley v.\nMcCoach, 928 F. Supp. 533, 541-42 (E.D. Pa. 1996).\n\nB. In addition, much of what Robinson characterizes as\nretaliation for her EEOC complaint is in fact alleged to have\noccurred before she filed the complaint. What Dickerson\nmay have done after Robinson \"refut[ed] one of his\nadvances\" might constitute evidence of a hostile work\nenvironment or of quid pro quo harassment, but since it\nhappened before Robinson filed her complaint, Robinson\ncannot establish a causal connection between her\ncomplaint and the conduct. What remains of Robinson's\nevidence is essentially as follows: (1) that a co-worker\nnamed Mona Wallace retaliated against Robinson by\nrestricting her computer access during the summer of 1994\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nplaintiff in the eyes of his peers \"and made it more difficult for him to\nprocure future employment\"); Sherman v. Burke Contracting, Inc., 891\nF.2d 1527, 1532 (11th Cir. 1990) (retaliation claim proper where\nplaintiff's former employer persuaded plaintiff's new employer to fire\nhim).\n\n                    23\n\fto weekdays, in contrast to Robinson's previously\nunrestricted access; and (2) that the \"ten-car memo\" written\nby Edwards and sent to Bochter, Dickerson, and Buford\nwas a retaliatory attempt to force Robinson to return to\nworking under the direct supervision of Dickerson, her\nalleged harasser. Assuming arguendo that Wallace's\nconduct and Edwards's memo constitute \"adverse\nemployment action,\" we do not believe that Robinson\ndemonstrated the required \"causal link\" between her\ncomplaint and either Wallace's conduct or Edwards's\nmemo. Aman, 88 F.3d at 198.\n\nRobinson testified that one Saturday during the summer\nof 1994, she attempted to work on her computer but was\nunable to do so because her authorization had been\nrestricted to weekdays. (App. 240) Before that time,\nRobinson had had unrestricted computer access. (App. 240)\nWallace, who was a co-worker of Robinson's, is not\nimplicated in any way in any of the alleged sexual\nharassment. Robinson points to no evidence that anyone\nother than Wallace was involved in the decision to restrict\nher computer access, and she offers no evidence of any sort\nto show that Wallace took this action in retaliation for\nRobinson's complaint. On the contrary, Robinson relies\nmerely on a post hoc, ergo propter hoc inference from the\nfact that the restriction was imposed after Robinsonfiled\nher complaint.\n\nOur cases are seemingly split on the question whether\nthe timing of the allegedly retaliatory conduct can, by itself,\nsupport a finding of causation. Compare Jalil v. Avdel\nCorp., 873 F.2d 701, 708 (3d Cir. 1989) (plaintiff\n\"demonstrated the causal link . . . by the circumstance that\nthe discharge followed rapidly, only two days later, upon\nAvdel's receipt of notice of [his] EEOC claim\") with Delli\nSanti v. CNA Ins. Co., 88 F.3d 192, 199 n.10 (3d Cir. 1996)\n(\"timing alone will not suffice to prove retaliatory motive\").\nIn Woodson v. Scott Paper Co., 109 F.3d 913, 920 (3d Cir.\n1997), relying on Jalil, we stated in dicta that \"temporal\nproximity between the protected activity and the\ntermination is sufficient to establish a causal link.\" On the\nother hand, in Quiroga v. Hasbro, Inc., 934 F.2d 497 (3d\nCir. 1991), we characterized our statement in Jalil that the\n\n                    24\n\f\"timing of the discharge in relation to Jalil's EEOC\ncomplaint may suggest discriminatory motives\" as the\nholding of that case, and stated that in Jalil \"we stopped\nshort of creating an inference based upon timing alone.\" Id.\nat 501 (emphasis added).\n\nWe believe that, if Jalil is to be interpreted as holding\nthat timing alone can be sufficient, that holding must be\nconfined to the unusually suggestive facts of Jalil. Thus,\neven if timing alone can prove causation where the\ndischarge follows only two days after the complaint, the\nmere fact that adverse employment action occurs after a\ncomplaint will ordinarily be insufficient to satisfy the\nplaintiff's burden of demonstrating a causal link between\nthe two events. See Quiroga, 934 F.2d at 501 (holding that,\n\"[a]s a matter of fact,\" the timing of Quiroga's alleged\nconstructive discharge was not independently sufficient to\nprove it was caused by his complaint). There is no evidence\nthat Wallace's restriction of Robinson's computer access\nfollowed immediately upon her complaint, so this is thus\nnot one of the extraordinary cases where the plaintiff can\ndemonstrate causation simply by pointing to the timing of\nthe allegedly retaliatory action. Accordingly, we reject\nRobinson's claim that Wallace's action constituted unlawful\nretaliation.16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. Because Robinson has failed to present evidence of a causal\nconnection between her complaint and Wallace's conduct, Robinson has\nnot made out a prima facie case that Wallace's conduct constituted\nretaliation. See, e.g., Aman, 85 F.3d at 1085. Defendants therefore were\nnot required to proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for\nWallace's conduct. However, they did so, presenting evidence that\nWallace restricted Robinson's access because Robinson had been\ncommitting security breaches (for example, by bringing files home) and\nthat Wallace took this action entirely on her own. (App. 562-66, 579) If\ndefendants were obligated to proffer such an explanation, Robinson\nwould then have the burden of presenting evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude either that \"the articulated reason is a\npretext for the retaliation or that a discriminatory reason more likely\nmotivated the employer.\" Delli Santi, 88 F.3d at 199. Robinson has not\npointed to any implausibilities, inconsistencies, contradictions,\nincoherencies, or the like in Wallace's testimony, see Sheridan, 100 F.3d\nat 1072, and has not even attempted to explain why the jury should\n\n                    25\n\fA similar analysis applies to the \"ten-car memo\" written\nby Edwards in June 1994. Before that time, Robinson had\nbeen assigned to the \"ten-car\" (a drug suppression vehicle)\nbut had been detailed to criminal intelligence where she\nworked under Bochter. Dickerson was in charge of the ten-\ncar but had no supervisory authority over the criminal\nintelligence unit. The ten-car memo states that \"due to the\nincreased activity in the downtown area and with the\nending of the school year, the need for the extra assistance\nthat the ten car provides has increased. Due to these facts,\neffective immediately, all personnel assigned to a ten car is\n[sic] to be immediately informed that they will ride the\nvehicle that they are assigned to.\" (App. 237)\n\nRobinson seeks to portray this memo as a pretextual\nattempt to force her to work under Dickerson after having\nfiled a complaint against him. However, it is undisputed\nthat the memo was not applied to Robinson; she remained\nin the criminal intelligence unit from June 1994 (when the\nmemo was circulated) until October 1994, when she\nstopped reporting for work. (App. 239-40, 249-50) Again,\nRobinson attempts to link the ten-car memo to her\ncomplaint simply by pointing to the temporal sequence of\nthe two events, but in light of the circumstances noted\nabove, this is insufficient. There is consequently no basis\nfor a finding that the ten-car memo constituted retaliation\nagainst Robinson for her complaint of discrimination.\n\nRobinson's final argument is that the jury would have\nbeen entitled to return a verdict for her on her retaliation\nclaim if it had agreed that she was subjected to a hostile\nwork environment. She relies on our statement in Aman\nthat \"an atmosphere of condoned sexual harassment in the\nworkplace increases the likelihood of retaliation for\ncomplaints in individual cases,\" 85 F.3d at 1086, but that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndisbelieve Wallace. Nor does the record itself suggest any such reason.\nRather than showing that Wallace was in league with Dickerson or\nmanagement generally, the record in fact reveals that Wallace\naccompanied Robinson to the EEOC as \"moral support\" when Robinson\nfiled her complaint. (App. 560) We therefore hold, in the alternative, that\nRobinson failed to present evidence undermining defendants' proffered\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for the challenged conduct.\n\n                    26\n\fstatement is merely an empirical prediction; it is not a legal\ntheory that obviates the presentation of actual evidence of\nretaliation. In Hawkins v. Hennepin Technical Center, 900\nF.2d 153, 156 (8th Cir. 1990), the source of the cited\nstatement from Aman, the court held that the plaintiff\nshould have been allowed to present evidence of the\ndefendant's prior acts of sexual harassment, even if those\nacts were not independently actionable, in order to cast\ndoubt upon the credibility of the defendant's proffered\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for the allegedly\nretaliatory conduct. Id. at 155-56. In Hawkins, the plaintiff\nhad enough evidence of retaliation to get to the jury even\nwithout the evidence of \"condoned sexual harassment,\" so\nthe court's decision cannot be read as upholding the\nargument that Robinson urges upon us here.17\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. In Glass v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 34 F.3d 188, 195 (3d Cir. 1994),\nwe quoted the Eighth Circuit's statement in Hawkins with approval in\nsupport of the proposition that evidence that Glass had been subjected\nto racial harassment during a time period for which he received an\nunfavorable performance rating was relevant to show that that rating\nwas of questionable validity and thus that the employer's reliance on\nthat rating in denying Glass certain promotions was pretextual.\nTherefore, like Hawkins itself, Glass does not support the view that\nevidence that the employer condoned sexual harassment suffices to\nprove the element of the employee's prima facie case requiring a causal\nlink between his or her complaint and a subsequent adverse employment\naction.\n\nIn Woodson, we stated that evidence that the employer condoned a\nharasser's conduct can contribute to an inference that subsequent\nadverse employment action taken by the harasser against the plaintiff\nwas causally linked to the plaintiff's complaint about the harassment.\n109 F.3d at 922. This observation rests upon the recognition that, if the\nharasser got away with the harassment, it is more likely that he or she\nwill believe that retaliation will be safe as well, and conversely, if the\nemployer took prompt and adequate action against the harasser, the\nharasser will be less confident of his or her ability to engage in\nretaliation with impunity. In this case, however, Robinson does not\ncontend that Dickerson -- the alleged harasser-- took any retaliatory\naction against her.\n\nIn any event, we made it clear in Woodson that this sort of evidence\nwas not independently sufficient to support an inference of causation.\nSee id. at 921. Whereas Woodson presented other extensive evidence,\nRobinson seeks to rely solely on evidence that Dickerson subjected her\n\n                    27\n\fIn light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court's\ngrant of judgment as a matter of law to defendants on\nRobinson's Title VII and § 1983 retaliation claims.18\n\nVI.\n\nJury Instruction on Employer Liability\n\nThe district court denied the City's motion for judgment\nas a matter of law as to Robinson's claim under Title VII for\na hostile work environment, and the jury returned a verdict\nfor the City. Robinson contends that this verdict must be\nupset because the court erred in its instruction to the jury\non the issue of employer respondeat superior liability under\nTitle VII for hostile environment sexual harassment.19 As we\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nto a hostile work environment and that the City failed to take prompt\nand adequate action to remedy the harassment. If we were to uphold\nRobinson's argument, every employee who succeeds on a hostile\nenvironment claim would be able to prove a causal link between his or\nher complaint of harassment and any subsequent adverse employment\naction. We do not believe that actual proof of retaliatory motive can be\ndispensed with so easily.\n\n18. In addition to the grounds described in the text, which apply equally\nto Robinson's Title VII retaliation claim and her§ 1983 retaliation claim,\nwe hold that judgment as a matter of law was properly granted in favor\nof Edwards and Buford on Robinson's § 1983 retaliation claim on the\nground that neither Edwards nor Buford was personally involved in any\nretaliation. See Part III, supra. We also affirm the grant of judgment as\na matter of law to the City on the § 1983 retaliation claim on the\nadditional ground that there was no evidence of a municipal policy or\ncustom encouraging or permitting retaliation. See Part III.C, supra.\n\n19. In order to prevail on a claim under Title VII for a hostile work\nenvironment based on sex, an employee must prove that: \"(1) he or she\nsuffered intentional discrimination because of his or her sex; (2) the\ndiscrimination was pervasive and regular; (3) the discrimination\ndetrimentally affected the plaintiff; (4) the discrimination would\ndetrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position;\nand (5) respondeat superior liability existed.\" Knabe v. The Boury Corp.,\n___ F.3d ____, ____, 1997 WL 282905, *3 (3d Cir.)(citing Andrews, 895\nF.2d at 1482). It is undisputed on appeal that Robinson presented\nsufficient evidence of all five elements to create a jury question.\n\n                     28\n\fnoted in Bouton v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 29 F.3d 103 (3d\nCir. 1994), the Supreme Court \"has instructed courts to\nuse agency principles when deciding employer liability for\nsexually hostile work environments.\" Id. at 106 (citing\nMeritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 72 (1986)).\nWe explained that:\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219 provides\nthree potential bases for holding employers liable for\nsexual harassment perpetrated by their employees.\nSection 219(1) holds employers responsible for torts\ncommitted by their employees within the scope of their\nemployment. . . . [In addition,] [u]nder§ 219(2)(b),\nmasters are liable for their own negligence or\nrecklessness; in a harassment case, this is typically\nnegligent failure to discipline or fire, or failure to take\nremedial action upon notice of harassment. Finally,\nunder § 219(2)(d), if the servant relied upon apparent\nauthority or was aided by the agency relationship, the\nmaster is required to answer.\n\nId. In the instant case, Robinson contended that the City\nshould be held liable for Dickerson's alleged harassment on\nthe theory that the City had notice of the harassment yet\nfailed to take remedial action to put a stop to it. See Knabe\nv. The Boury Corp., ___ F.3d ___, ___, 1997 WL 282905, *4\n(3d Cir.) (same).\n\nThe court charged the jury as follows:\n\nTo prove the fifth element [respondeat superior liability\non the part of the City], wife-plaintiff must prove that\nthe City of Pittsburgh was negligent insofar as its\nprocedure for handling sexual harassment complaints\nwas not effective. It is important for you, the jury, to\nunderstand that the City of Pittsburgh may only be\nheld liable for the existence of a sexually hostile\nworking environment that results from its own\nnegligence. The City may not be held liable simply\nbecause one of its employees engaged in sexual\nharassment.\n\nThus, if the City of Pittsburgh had an effective\nprocedure for handling sexual harassment complaints\nat the time of the alleged incidents, the City was not\n\n                     29\n\fnegligent and it cannot be held liable for the improper\nconduct of its employees.\n\nIn order to determine whether the City of Pittsburgh\nwas negligent in this case, you must decide whether its\nsexual harassment procedure was effective. A sexual\nharassment procedure is effective if it is both known to\nthe victim of sexual harassment and its [sic] use of the\nprocedure timely stops the harassment.\n\n(App. 1331-32). Robinson timely objected to this charge\n(App. 1310-11, 1314-15), arguing that \"I think we've shown\nevidence where there was not an effective procedure.. . .\n[U]nder the facts of this case you can't presume there was\nan effective procedure, because the procedure required\nChief Edwards to take action, and he didn't.\" The court\nresponded that it was not, in fact, \"presuming\" that the\nCity had an effective anti-harassment procedure, and stated\nthat \"[i]t's the jury's job to decide whether it was effective or\nnot.\" (App. 1311) We exercise plenary review over the jury\ninstructions in order to determine whether, read as a\nwhole, they stated the correct legal standard. Miller v.\nCIGNA Corp., 47 F.3d 586, 591 (3d Cir. 1995) (en banc).\n\nIn Bouton, the case upon which the district court relied\nin its jury charge, we held that \"under negligence\nprinciples, prompt and effective action by the employer will\nrelieve it of liability.\" Bouton, 29 F.3d at 107 (emphasis\nadded). Robinson argues that the charge based on Bouton\nwas inappropriate because the complaint in that case did\nend the harassment, while her complaint did not. According\nto Robinson, the court should have based its jury\ninstruction on Andrews, a case where the complaint did not\nput a stop to the harassment. Robinson's argument is\nnothing more than a contention that the City's action in\nthis case was not \"effective.\" But whether Robinson's\ncomplaint put a stop to the harassment -- and whether any\nharassment occurred in the first place -- were factual\nissues committed to the jury. The basic problem with\nRobinson's argument is that it challenges the jury's verdict,\nnot the court's charge.\n\nRobinson contends that, even if the City put an end to\nthe harassment by transferring Dickerson following her\n\n                     30\n\fMay 1994 complaint, the City should have taken such\naction in 1992 when she first spoke to Edwards about\nDickerson's \"hitting on her.\" But Robinson argued at trial\nthat her 1992 conversation with Edwards constituted an\nattempt to avail herself of the City's anti-harassment\nprocedure, and that the City failed to respond adequately to\nher complaint. (App. 1405) If the jury had believed that the\n1992 conversation had taken place and that Robinson had\nmade it sufficiently clear to Edwards that she was\ncomplaining about conduct that she perceived as sexual\nharassment, the jury could have held the City liable. That\nit did not do so is not a basis to attack the charge.\nRobinson's argument, both as quoted above in her\nobjection to the charge in the district court and on appeal,\nruns more like an argument in favor of judgment as a\nmatter of law that the City did not take adequate remedial\naction once it learned of the harassment than a challenge\nto a jury instruction. Robinson did not move for such a\njudgment, however, and it is plain that no such judgment\nwould have been warranted in view of the evidentiary\ndisputes regarding whether the harassment occurred and\nwhen the City found out about it. As the district court put\nit, \"it's the jury's job to decide whether [the City's anti-\nharassment procedure] was effective or not.\" We reject\nRobinson's argument that the Bouton charge was\ninappropriate on the facts of her case, because it was for\nthe jury in its verdict, not the court in its charge, to decide\nwhat the facts of this case were.20\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20. After the trial in this case, we decided Knabe v. The Boury Corp., ___\nF.3d ____, 1997 Wl 282905 (3d Cir.). As noted above, in Bouton we\narticulated the standard as whether the employer's remedial action was\n\"effective.\" See 29 F.3d at 107. In Andrews, we phrased the standard\nsomewhat differently, stating that the employer will be liable if its\nremedial action was not \"adequate.\" See 895 F.2d at 1486. If there was\nany conflict between the \"adequacy\" standard expressed in Andrews and\nthe \"effectiveness\" standard set forth in Bouton, Knabe has resolved it. In\nKnabe, we rejected the plaintiff's argument that an employer is liable\nunless it took remedial action that was actually \"effective\" to put a stop\nto the harassment in the particular case at hand. We held instead that\na remedial action is \"adequate\" if it was \"reasonably calculated to\nprevent further harassment,\" whether or not it actually succeeded in\ndoing so. Id. at __, *5 (citations omitted). See also id. at __, *4 n.8.\nTherefore, the charge in this case arguably misled the jury into believing\nthat the City's response had to be actually effective. Of course, in view\nof the jury's verdict for the City, no prejudice flowed from this possible\nerror.\n\n                    31\n\fVII.\n\nAfter the district court granted defendants' motion for\njudgment as a matter of law on Robinson's quid pro quo\nharassment and retaliation claims, defendants' counsel\nasked the court to remove from the record certain exhibits\nthat \"were offered with relation to those claims.\" (App.\n1307). The court then went through the exhibits in\nquestion with counsel and excluded all but two of them.\n(App. 1308-13) Later, in charging the jury, the court listed\nthe claims that it had \"disposed of\" and told the jury that\n\"these claims are of no concern to you. The evidence you\nheard concerning these claims is no longer relevant and\nshould not be considered by you.\" (App. 1326) On appeal,\nRobinson argues that these evidentiary rulings and this\nstatement were erroneous because evidence of quid pro quo\nharassment and retaliation, even if it does not concern\nconduct that is serious enough to be independently\nactionable on a quid pro quo or a retaliation theory, may\nnevertheless be relevant to show a hostile work\nenvironment. These errors, she submits, require reversal of\nthe jury's verdict in favor of the City on her Title VII hostile\nenvironment claim.\n\nWe need not consider this argument, because we do not\nbelieve that Robinson raised it in the district court. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 46 requires \"that a party, at the time the ruling or\norder of the court is made or sought, make[ ] known to the\ncourt the action which the party desires the court to take\nor the party's objection to the action of the court and the\ngrounds therefor.\" We conclude that, while Robinson may\nhave made a timely objection to the evidentiary exclusions\nthat she contests, she at no time made known to the\ndistrict court the ground that she now presses in this\ncourt.\n\nAs noted, the court analyzed each exhibit that defendants\nsought to exclude. For most of the exhibits mentioned\nduring that process, plaintiffs' counsel voiced no objection,\nand neither of the two objections that he did raise related\nto the argument described above upon which Robinson now\nrelies. First, plaintiffs' counsel objected to the exclusion of\nexhibit 57-X, arguing that it was relevant to undermine the\ncredibility of a witness named Gail Payne by showing \"her\n\n                     32\n\fmotive in giving testimony the way she did and what she\nsaid.\" (App. 1308) The court disagreed, and removed the\nexhibit from the record. Next, counsel argued that exhibit\n78 was relevant to show that the City's response to\nRobinson's complaint of harassment was ineffective. (App.\n1310) The court disagreed, stating that the exhibit only\n\"has to do with retaliation.\" (App. 1311) Robinson does not\nrenew either of these objections on appeal. After the court\nand counsel had gone through all of the exhibits at issue,\nplaintiffs' counsel stated that \"[t]o make the record clear,\nYour Honor, I would just like to for the record, to formally\nobject to the Court's ruling based on the Bouton case and\nthe evidentiary rulings you just made.\" (App. 1315) Counsel\noffered no further explanation of the grounds for this\nobjection.\n\nSubsequently, in charging the jury, the court made the\nstatement quoted above that Robinson now challenges.\nAfter completing the jury charge, the court told counsel at\nsidebar that \"[n]ow is your opportunity to put exceptions to\nthe charge on record.\" (App. 1348) Plaintiffs' counsel did\nnot mention the challenged statement, and did not\notherwise make known the argument that Robinson now\nmakes on appeal.\n\nWe therefore conclude that plaintiffs' counsel never gave\nthe district court any reason to believe that he was making\nthe argument that evidence of quid pro quo harassment\nand retaliation, even if not actionable on those theories,\nwas nevertheless relevant to show a hostile work\nenvironment. Because Robinson did not raise that\nargument in the district court, we decline to consider it on\nappeal.21\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21. Robinson argues that the court erred in refusing to allow her to\npresent evidence that the City transferred officers to the detective bureau\non the basis of nepotism and favoritism, in violation of its written\npolicies. We find no error in the district court's ruling that the proffered\nevidence could not give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination\nbecause of sex. Finally, Robinson challenges the court's refusal to admit\nthe report prepared by the City's Office of Professional Responsibility\nthat found that Dickerson had created an \"uncomfortable\" work\nenvironment for another woman. The court allowed Robinson to elicit the\n\n                    33\n\fVIII.\n\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the\ndistrict court's grant of defendants' motion for judgment as\na matter of law with respect to Robinson's claims under\n§ 1983 against Buford, Edwards, and the City for sex\ndiscrimination and retaliation and Robinson's claim under\nTitle VII against the City for retaliation. We reverse the\ngrant of judgment as a matter of law with respect to\nRobinson's claim under Title VII for quid pro quo sexual\nharassment against the City and remand for trial of that\nclaim. On remand, the district court should ascertain\nwhether Robinson seeks to pursue a claim under § 1983 for\nquid pro quo harassment against Dickerson, and if so,\nwhether she should be permitted to do so in light of the\nprior proceedings in this case. See n.14, supra. In all other\nrespects, we affirm the district court's rulings and its entry\nof judgment upon the jury's verdict.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\nClerk of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nreport's conclusions as admissions by the City, but excluded the report\nitself as irrelevant. Robinson contends that the report shows notice to\nthe City of Dickerson's alleged harassment of her. We find no error here\nas well. The conduct on the part of Dickerson discussed in the report is\nnot his alleged harassment of Robinson, so the report in no way put the\nCity on notice that Dickerson was harassing Robinson.\n\n                    34\n\f",

Robinson alleges that she was sexually\nharassed by appellee James Dickerson (her supervisor) and\nthat appellees Craig Edwards (an assistant police chief) and\nEarl Buford (the chief of police) knew of the harassment but\nfailed to take action to stop it. Robinson asserted a variety\nof claims under both federal and state law against\nDickerson, Edwards, Buford, and the City. At the close of\nplaintiffs' case, the district court granted defendants'\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law on several of\nRobinson's claims. The jury returned verdicts for\ndefendants on the claims that remained. In this appeal,\nplaintiffs challenge the grant of judgment as a matter of\nlaw, a jury instruction, and certain evidentiary rulings. We\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n\nI.\n\nRobinson began working as a Pittsburgh police officer in\n1990. Hawthorne, her husband, also worked as a police\nofficer for the City. In January 1992, Robinson was\nassigned to a drug suppression unit commanded by then-\n\n                    2\n\fLieutenant Dickerson. Hawthorne worked in the same unit\nuntil June 1992, and Robinson contends that after he left\nto begin a new assignment, Dickerson began sexually\nharassing her. According to Robinson, the harassment\nincluded unhooking her bra, snapping her bra strap,\ntouching her hair and ears, telling her \"you stink pretty,\"\nmaking comments about the size of her breasts, blowing\nher a kiss, asking her out for a drink, touching her leg\nunder a table, putting his hands around her waist,\ndropping his keys down the back of her shirt and\nattempting to retrieve them, and describing the position in\nwhich he and Robinson would have sex if they were to do\nso. Robinson testified that she never acceded to any of\nDickerson's sexual advances or reciprocated any of his\nsexual remarks and that she made it clear to him that his\nconduct was unwelcome.\n\nIn the fall of 1992, Robinson approached Assistant Chief\nEdwards to inquire about a transfer to the detective bureau\n(which would have been a promotion). Edwards had no\ndirect supervisory authority over Robinson, but was one of\ntwo second-in-command officers who reported directly to\nChief Buford. (App. 89-90; 585-86) Robinson testified that\nshe told Edwards that she thought Dickerson \"was hitting\non [her]\" and \"coming on to [her].\" (App. 146-47) She said\nthat Edwards advised her to \"wait it out\" because he\nthought that Chief Buford might be leaving soon for\nanother job. Edwards reportedly said that Buford might\ntake Dickerson with him and that even if Dickerson\nremained, Buford's departure would allow Edwards to\nobtain power over Dickerson. (App. 147) Until then,\nhowever, Edwards allegedly told Robinson he could not do\nanything about Dickerson because Buford protected him.\n(App. 147-48) In addition, according to Robinson, Edwards\ntold her that Buford would not do anything to help her\nbecause Dickerson \"had done this before\" and Buford had\nnot done anything following that incident. (App. 148)\nRobinson testified that she believed \"waiting it out\" was a\n\"viable solution\" and that she did not tell her husband\nabout the harassment or do anything else about it at the\ntime. (App. 149)1\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. In addition to this request, Robinson sought a transfer to the detective\nbureau on several other occasions, but she never succeeded in obtaining\nsuch a transfer.\n\n                    3\n\fIn May 1993, Robinson wrote a letter to Buford in which\nshe asked to meet with him. According to Robinson, her\noriginal draft of the letter, prepared in March or April 1993,\nstated that Dickerson was \"coming on to [her]\" and that she\nthought that this was \"the reason for [her] now bad\nreputation.\" (App. 168) Robinson recounted that she gave\nthe letter to Edwards to look over and that Edwards told\nher that she could not send the letter through the chain of\ncommand because it was too \"specific in detail.\" According\nto Robinson, Edwards recommended that she \"just be\nspecific about requesting a meeting.\" (App. 166-67) The\noriginal draft was never introduced in evidence. The letter\nthat was actually sent to Buford requested a meeting in\norder to discuss \"career goals\" and \"past conflicts\" and to\n\"seek guidance with future endeavors.\" The letter made no\nmention of sexual harassment. Upon receipt of the letter,\nBuford returned it to Robinson with a notation that it\nneeded to be transmitted through the proper chain of\ncommand rather than sent directly to him.\n\nIn January 1994, Robinson was detailed to the criminal\nintelligence unit, where her direct supervisor was Sergeant\nWilliam Bochter and her second-line supervisor was Chief\nBuford. In this assignment, neither Dickerson nor Edwards\npossessed any supervisory authority over Robinson. In May\n1994, Robinson met with Edwards, told him she was \"fed\nup\" with the harassment, and stated her intention to file a\ncomplaint. She testified that Edwards recommended that\nshe file a complaint with the Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").\n\nA few weeks later, Robinson filed a complaint with\nBochter, who forwarded it to Buford on May 31, 1994. On\nJune 1, 1994, Robinson filed a complaint with the EEOC\nalleging that Dickerson had sexually harassed her, and on\nJuly 6, 1994, she filed a similar complaint with the Bureau\nof Police Office of Professional Standards (\"OPS\"). OPS's\ninvestigation, which was completed in September 1994,\nconcluded that probable cause existed to substantiate\nRobinson's claim.2 In October 1994, Robinson stopped\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. The district court did not allow the OPS report itself to be introduced\nin evidence, but it permitted the investigating officer, Carla Gedman, to\ntestify as to her conclusions on the ground that they were admissions by\na party-opponent and thus not hearsay.\n\n                    4\n\freporting for work, and she has not returned to her job\nsince that time. She was nonetheless promoted to sergeant\nin February 1995.\n\nII.\n\nIn August 1994, Robinson and Hawthorne filed suit in\ndistrict court against the City, Buford, Edwards, and\nDickerson. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a), Robinson asserted claims against\nthe City for hostile work environment and quid pro quo\nsexual harassment and for retaliation, as well as a claim for\nhostile work environment sexual harassment against\nDickerson. Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, she asserted claims,\nbased on alleged violations of the Equal Protection Clause,\nagainst all four defendants. She claimed that all four were\nresponsible for unconstitutional sex-based discrimination\nand that all but Dickerson were liable for unlawful\nretaliation. In addition, Robinson asserted claims under\nPennsylvania law for assault, battery, and intentional\ninfliction of emotional distress against Dickerson. Robinson\nsought punitive damages on all claims. Hawthorne sued\nDickerson under Pennsylvania law for loss of consortium.\nDickerson counter-claimed against Robinson for\ndefamation.\n\nAt the close of plaintiffs' case, defendants moved for\njudgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n50(a). The district court granted defendants' motion as to\nthe Title VII hostile work environment claim against\nDickerson because individuals cannot be liable under that\nstatute. See Sheridan v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729752\"><a href=\"/opinion/729752/barbara-r-sheridan-v-ei-dupont-de-nemours-and-company-jacques-amblard/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1077-78 (3d Cir. 1996) (en banc). The court\ngranted the motion as to all of Robinson's § 1983 claims\nagainst the City on the ground that there was insufficient\nevidence of an unconstitutional policy or custom.\nFurthermore, with respect to the Title VII retaliation claim\nagainst the City (and in the alternative with respect to the\n§ 1983 retaliation claim against the City, Buford, and\nEdwards), the court held that Robinson had not shown a\ncausal link between her protected activity and any adverse\nemployment action. The court granted the motion with\nrespect to Robinson's Title VII quid pro quo claim against\n\n                    5\n\fthe City because the court found insufficient evidence that\na job benefit or detriment was conditioned upon Robinson's\nresponse to Dickerson's advances or that her response to\nhis advances in fact affected a tangible aspect of her\nemployment. Moreover, the court granted defendants'\nmotion as to the § 1983 claims against Buford and Edwards\non the ground that there was insufficient evidence that\neither was personally involved in any deprivation of\nRobinson's rights (as well as, with respect to the retaliation\ntheory, on the alternative ground described above). Finally,\nthe court granted the motion as to the intentional infliction\nclaim against Dickerson and struck Robinson's demand for\npunitive damages on all claims because there was\ninsufficient evidence of outrageous conduct.\n\nThe claims that went to the jury were thus as follows: (1)\nthe Title VII hostile work environment claim against the\nCity; (2) the § 1983 sex discrimination claim against\nDickerson; (3) the assault and battery claims against\nDickerson; (4) Hawthorne's loss of consortium claim against\nDickerson; and (5) Dickerson's defamation counter-claim.\nThe jury returned verdicts for the defense on all of\nplaintiffs' claims, as well as a verdict for Robinson on the\ncounter-claim.\n\nRobinson appeals from the grant of judgment as a matter\nof law on all claims except the Title VII and intentional\ninfliction claims against Dickerson.3 In addition, she\ncontests certain evidentiary rulings and a jury instruction\nthat allegedly affected the jury's rejection of the claims that\nit was permitted to consider. Nothing is at issue in this\nappeal with respect to the defamation counter-claim, the\nassault and battery claims, or the loss of consortium claim.\n\nWe exercise plenary review over the district court's grant\nof judgment as a matter of law.

City of\nPhiladelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597820\"><a href=\"/opinion/597820/carol-keenan-and-lawrence-gerrard-and-ernest-gilbert-and-walter-smith-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 465 (3d Cir. 1993). Moreover,\nto hold Buford or Edwards liable under § 1983 for such an\nequal protection violation, Robinson was required to prove\nthat they personally \"participated in violating [her] rights,\n. . . that [they] directed others to violate them, or that [they]\n. . . had knowledge of and acquiesced in [their]\nsubordinates' violations.\" Baker v.

Robinson\ndoes not contend that either Buford or Edwards personally\nengaged in any discriminatory conduct against her or that\nthey directed anyone else to do so. Rather, her argument is\nthat Buford and Edwards were aware of and acquiesced in\nDickerson's sexual harassment. We must thus determine,\ntaking Robinson's evidence as true and giving her the\nbenefit of all reasonable inferences, what Edwards and\n\n                     7\n\fBuford knew about the harassment, when they learned\nabout it, and what, if anything, they did in response.\n\nA. Robinson does not seek to hold Edwards liable for\nanything that he did or did not do following her May 1994\ncomplaint. Rather, she contends that she told Edwards in\n1992 that Dickerson was \"hitting on [her]\" and that\nEdwards \"acquiesced\" in Dickerson's conduct because he\ndid not take any action to stop Dickerson but instead told\nRobinson to \"wait it out\" because Buford and/or Dickerson\nmight soon be changing jobs.\n\nEdwards responds that the jury's verdict for the City on\nRobinson's Title VII hostile work environment claim\nconclusively establishes that he cannot be liable under\n§ 1983 for acquiescing in her subjection to a hostile\nenvironment. If there was no hostile environment in the\nfirst place, Edwards's argument goes, then he logically\ncannot be liable for knowingly acquiescing in the existence\nof one. We reject this argument because, among other\nthings, it ignores the fact that the jury's verdict does not\nnecessarily mean that it found that Robinson was not\nsubjected to a hostile work environment. Instead, the jury\nmight have rejected her Title VII hostile work environment\nclaim on the ground that the City had an effective policy\nagainst sexual harassment. See, e.g., Bouton v. BMW of N.\nAm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673855\"><a href=\"/opinion/673855/trude-s-bouton-v-bmw-of-north-america-inc-trude-bouton-in-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">29</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 110 (3d Cir. 1994).\n\nWe agree with Edwards, however, that there was\ninsufficient evidence to show that he knew of and\nacquiesced in Dickerson's alleged sexual harassment. It is\ntrue that the jury could have found that Edwards knew in\n1992 that Dickerson was \"hitting on\" Robinson and that\nEdwards did not take any action to stop Dickerson's\nconduct. But it is undisputed that, while Edwards had a\nhigher rank than Dickerson, he possessed no actual\nsupervisory authority over him. (App. 1031-32) Regardless\nof whether the evidence presented by Robinson would be\nadequate if Edwards had actual supervisory authority over\nDickerson, we do not believe that Edwards can be held\nliable under § 1983 for failing to take action to correct the\nbehavior of an individual over whom he had no actual\ncontrol.\n\n                    8\n\f\"A defendant in a [§ 1983] action must have personal\ninvolvement in the alleged wrongs.\" Rode v. Dellarciprete,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505504\"><a href=\"/opinion/505504/vivian-m-rode-and-jay-c-hileman-v-nicholas-g-dellarciprete-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1195</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (3d Cir. 1988) (emphasis added). See\nalso, e.g., Andrews, 895 F.2d at 1478 (\"there must be some\naffirmative conduct by the supervisor that played a role in\nthe discrimination\") (citing Rizzo v. Goode, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109349\"><a href=\"/opinion/109349/rizzo-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n377 (1976)). Our cases have held that \"actual knowledge\nand acquiescence\" suffices for supervisory liability because\nit can be equated with \"personal direction\" and \"direct\ndiscrimination by the supervisor.\" Id. (quoting Rode, 845\nF.2d at 1207). Where a supervisor with authority over a\nsubordinate knows that the subordinate is violating\nsomeone's rights but fails to act to stop the subordinate\nfrom doing so, the factfinder may usually infer that the\nsupervisor \"acquiesced\" in (i.e., tacitly assented to or\naccepted) the subordinate's conduct.4 But where actual\nsupervisory authority is lacking, mere inaction, in most\ncircumstances, does not reasonably give rise to a similar\ninference. As a general matter, a person who fails to act to\ncorrect the conduct of someone over whom he or she has\nno supervisory authority cannot fairly be said to have\n\"acquiesced\" in the latter's conduct.\n\nGeneral tort principles provide a useful analogy. Unless a\n\"master\"-\"servant\" relationship exists, the circumstances in\nwhich one person may be held liable for a tort committed\nby another are quite limited, see Restatement (Second) of\nTorts §§ 876-878 (1977), and none appears to be applicable\nhere. A claim against a \"master\" based on a tort committed\nby a \"servant\" bears a resemblance to a § 1983 claim\nagainst a government supervisor based on a constitutional\ntort committed by a subordinate,5 but a person cannot be\na \"master\" unless he or she has \"the right to control the\nphysical conduct\" of the servant. Restatement (Second) of\nAgency § 2(1) (1957). By analogy, we hold that, except\nperhaps in unusual circumstances, a government official or\nemployee who lacks supervisory authority over the person\nwho commits a constitutional tort cannot be held, based on\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 18 (1971); Random\nHouse Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged Ed. 13 (1967).\n\n5. We do not suggest, however, that all rules applicable to the former\ntype of claim may be applied by analogy to the latter.\n\n                    9\n\fmere inaction,6 to have \"acquiesced\" in the unconstitutional\nconduct.\n\nHere, it is clear that Edwards did not control or have the\nright to control Dickerson's physical conduct in the\nperformance of his job, and Edwards is thus not liable for\nDickerson's conduct.7 Accordingly, we affirm the district\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. Of course, if the government official or employee had sufficient\npersonal involvement in the constitutional tort, he or she may be held\nliable. In this context, the rules set out in §§ 876 and 877(a) of the\nRestatement (Second) of Torts provide useful guidance. Section 876\nstates:\n\nFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of\nanother, one is subject to liability if he\n\n(a) does a tortious act in concert with the other or pursuant to a\ncommon design with him, or\n\n(b) knows that the other's conduct constitutes a b reach of duty\nand gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so\nto conduct himself, or\n\n(c) gives substantial assistance to the other in a ccomplishing a\ntortious result and his own conduct, separately considered,\nconstitutes a breach of duty to the third person.\n\nSection 877(a) provides:\n\nFor harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of\nanother, one is subject to liability if he\n\n(a) orders or induces the conduct, if he knows or should know of\ncircumstances that would make the conduct tortious if it were his\nown . . . .\n\n7. All of our prior cases discussing the issue of supervisory liability for\n\"acquiescence\" involved defendants who had actual authority to control\nthe conduct of the person alleged to have violated the plaintiff's rights.\nOur decision here is thus fully consistent with our holdings in those\ncases.\n\nFor example, in Baker, 50 F.3d at 1193-94, we held that the officer\nwho was in charge of a drug raid could be liable under § 1983 for certain\nallegedly illegal actions taken by the officers under his command where\nthere was \"sufficient evidence to permit an inference that [the\ncommanding officer] knew of and acquiesced in the treatment the\n[plaintiffs] were receiving at the hands of the other officers acting under\n\n                    10\n\fcourt's grant of judgment as a matter of law to Edwards on\nRobinson's § 1983 equal protection claim.\n\nB. Robinson argues that Buford is liable under§ 1983\nfor Dickerson's conduct because Buford \"took absolutely no\naction to remedy Robinson's situation, and the evidence\nsuggests that he thought Dickerson's conduct a joke.\"\nAppellants' Br. at 22. We disagree, because we are unable\nto find any evidence that Buford had any knowledge of any\nalleged harassment before May 1994. (As with Edwards,\nRobinson does not argue that Buford is liable based on\nanything he did or failed to do following her May 1994\ncomplaint.)\n\nRobinson testified that Edwards told her in 1992 that it\nwould not serve any purpose for him to forward her\ncomplaint to Buford because Buford would not take it\nseriously. It seems most doubtful that Edwards's statement\nwould have been admissible at trial against Buford, but in\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nhis supervision.\" 50 F.3d at 1193. The commanding officer indisputedly\nhad the authority to control the conduct of the officers under his\ncommand.\n\nIn Keenan, 983 F.2d at 465-68, the plaintiffs alleged that they were\ntransferred in retaliation for protected activity, and the jury agreed. We\nheld that four supervisors could be liable under § 1983 where they knew\nof the plaintiffs' protected activity and approved the transfers anyway. Id.\nat 468. We concluded that \"the evidence [was] sufficient to establish that\nthe plaintiffs were impermissibly disciplined by [the four supervisors] for\nconduct that constituted protected activity.\" Id. Keenan is\ndistinguishable because the four supervisors approved the transfers and\npossessed formal authority over their respective subordinates who\nrecommended the transfers.\n\nIn Andrews, 895 F.2d at 1478-79, the supervisors not only had direct\nauthority over the primary harassers but also were personally involved\nin the unconstitutional conduct. We upheld a verdict against one\nsupervisor who \"personally participated in\" and \"condoned\" the\nharassment perpetrated by other officers under his supervision. As to\nanother supervisor, \"the man who was ultimately responsible for the\nconduct of the Division,\" we held that the evidence supported the jury's\nfinding that he was aware of the harassment and not only did nothing\nto stop it, but told the plaintiff that \"you have to expect this working\nwith the guys.\" Id. at 1479.\n\n                    11\n\fany event this statement in no way tends to show that\nBuford in fact was aware in 1992 that Dickerson was\nsexually harassing Robinson. The uncontradicted evidence\nshows that Buford first learned of Robinson's complaint\nwhen Bochter told him about it on May 31, 1994. We\ntherefore affirm the district court's grant of judgment as a\nmatter of law to Buford on Robinson's § 1983 equal\nprotection claim.\n\nC. Our conclusion that Buford is not liable under\n§ 1983 for Dickerson's alleged sexual harassment requires\nus to reject as well Robinson's submission that the City is\nliable under § 1983 for Dickerson's alleged sexual\nharassment. The City, as a municipality, is not liable\nthrough respondeat superior for the constitutional torts of\nits employees. Monell v. Dept. of Social Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978). Municipal liability attaches only \"when\nexecution of a government's policy or custom, whether\nmade by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts\nmay fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the\ninjury\" complained of. Id. at 694. As we explained in\nAndrews:\n\nA government policy or custom can be established in\none of two ways.

Rev. 273, 277 (1995), but since the parties here have not\naddressed the issue, we assume that the City would be liable for any\nquid pro quo sexual harassment committed by Dickerson. Cf. Bouton, 29\nF.3d at 106-07 (stating, in a case involving only a hostile environment\nclaim, that \"[w]ithout the agency relationship, quid pro quo harassment\nwould be impossible, so the employer is responsible\").\n\n                   14\n\fenvironment case or a quid pro quo case, objectionable\nconduct attributable to an employer is not always sufficient\nto alter an employee's terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment and is thus not always sufficient to violate\nTitle VII.\n\nSubsections (1) and (2) of 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a) differ in\nthat subsection (1) addresses cases in which an employee\nis told beforehand that his or her compensation or some\nother term, condition, or privilege of employment will be\naffected by his or her response to the unwelcome sexual\nadvances, whereas subsection (2) addresses cases in which\nthe employee's response to sexual advances is thereafter\nused as a basis for a decision concerning compensation,\netc. Under subsection (1), a quid pro quo violation occurs\nat the time when an employee is told that his or her\ncompensation, etc. is dependent upon submission to\nunwelcome sexual advances. At that point, the employee\nhas been subjected to discrimination because of sex. (This\nis so, of course, because, if the employee had been a\nmember of the opposite sex, his or her compensation, etc.\npresumably would not have been made dependent on\nsubmission.) Whether the employee thereafter submits to or\nrebuffs the advances, a violation has nevertheless occurred.\nLike the Second Circuit, we \"do not read Title VII to punish\nthe victims of sexual harassment who surrender to\nunwelcome sexual encounters. . . . The supervisor's\nconduct is equally unlawful under Title VII whether the\nemployee submits or not.\" Karibian, 14 F.3d at 778.10\n\nSimilarly, there is a violation under subsection (1) even if\nthe employee rebuffs the advances and his or her\ncompensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\nemployment are not in fact altered, i.e., even if the\nsupervisor does not follow through on his or her threat. The\nthreat is sufficient to constitute \"discriminat[ion] . . . with\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n10. Whether the employee \"submi[tted] to the supervisor's advances is\ncertainly relevant\" because it bears on \"the issue whether the sexual\nadvances were unwelcome, not whether unwelcome sexual advances\nwere unlawful.\" Karibian, 14 F.3d at 779. In this case, it is undisputed\nthat Robinson refused to submit to Dickerson's alleged advances, and it\nis clear that the jury would have been entitled tofind that the advances\nwere unwelcome.\n\n                    15\n\frespect to . . . compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of . . . sex.\" 11 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a)(1).

Under subsection (2), the plaintiff must\nshow that his or her response to unwelcome advances was\nsubsequently used as a basis for a decision about\ncompensation, etc. Thus, the plaintiff need not show that\nsubmission was linked to compensation, etc. at or before\nthe time when the advances occurred. But the employee\nmust show that his or her response was in fact used\nthereafter as a basis for a decision affecting his or her\ncompensation, etc.\n\nB. Robinson contends that Dickerson linked her\nresponse to his advances to the job detriments of \"a bad\nreputation at work\" and \"unjust reprimands.\" Appellants'\nBr. at 28-29. Robinson explains that \"[m]any times after\nRobinson would reject him, Dickerson unjustifiably\nreprimanded her in a very harsh manner and in front of\nother officers; he continuously bothered her at work, even\nwhen she was not under his direct command; he phoned\nher at home and work for reasons unrelated to police\nbusiness; and he made negative comments to her regarding\nher work and her marriage.\" Appellants' Br. at 29 (citations\nomitted).\n\nWe are not persuaded that these alleged actions, even\nwhen taken together, rose to the level of conduct affecting\nRobinson's \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\"\nof employment. Formal reprimands that result in a notation\nin an employee's personnel file could be sufficiently\nconcrete, but harsh words that lack real consequences are\nnot. See Meritor, 477 U.S. at 67.\n\nWe reach a different conclusion with respect to\nRobinson's allegation that Dickerson blocked her transfer to\nthe detective bureau because she refused to accede to his\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n11. The fact that no adverse action was taken is of course relevant to the\nquestion whether a threat or promise was made.\n\n                    16\n\fadvances. The record before us would certainly permit the\nconclusion that Robinson was denied a transfer to the\ndetective bureau (which would have been a promotion)\nbecause she had performed unsatisfactorily in two\nundercover assignments, because she was unable to accept\ncriticism or take direction, or for other valid work-related\nreasons. However, we believe that the record would also\nsupport a finding that Dickerson refused to recommend her\ntransfer because she rebuffed his advances. It is\nundisputed that a supervisor's recommendation weighs\nvery heavily in determining who is transferred, so the jury\ncould conclude that Dickerson's refusal to recommend\nRobinson cost her the transfer. Accordingly, the evidence\nwas sufficient to support a finding of quid pro quo\nharassment within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(2).12\n\nRobinson testified that Dickerson told her on several\noccasions that he would recommend her for transfer to the\ndetective bureau (App. 111, 113-14, 121-22, 142, 160-61),\nbut that after a party at which Dickerson touched her leg\nunder the table and pulled her into a compromising\nposition for a photograph, he responded to her renewed\ninquiry about the transfer by telling her that \"he had talked\nto the Chief and he had talked to other detectives, and they\nhad all said I had a bad attitude,\" implying that this was\nthe reason she had not been transferred. (App. 143) She\nalso testified that, when she spoke to Edwards shortly\nthereafter, he confirmed that Dickerson had \"been saying\nbad things about [her] lately to Buford and [him].\" (App.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n12. Robinson has not called to our attention any admissible evidence\nthat Dickerson explicitly threatened her before or at the time he made a\nsexual advance that her response would affect her \"compensation, terms,\nconditions, or privileges\" of employment. See 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(1).\nIn light of our conclusion that the evidence is sufficient to show that\nDickerson in fact did use Robinson's response to his advances as a basis\nfor a decision affecting her compensation, etc. within the meaning of\nsubsection (2), we need not consider whether the evidence would support\na finding that Dickerson imposed such a condition \"implicitly\" before or\nat the time he made the alleged advances within the meaning of\nsubsection (1). On remand, the district court should decide whether\nRobinson can proceed to trial based only on the theory of quid pro quo\nharassment set out in 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(2) or whether she can rely\non 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)(1) as well.\n\n                   17\n\f145) When she asked Edwards how she should deal with\nthat and told him that \"none of it [what Dickerson had been\nsaying] was true,\" he replied, \"I know. I know Jim is like\nthat. . . . Jimmy thinks he's a lover.\" (App. 146) Moreover,\nwhen Robinson asked Edwards why he thought Dickerson\nwas saying bad things about her, Edwards said that\n\"Dickerson would like to have nothing better than a 23-\nyear-old girl like you.\" (App. 146) Robinson testified that,\nafter Dickerson told her again in April 1993 that she would\nbe transferred, Edwards \"told [her] that he [didn't] know\nwhy Commander Dickerson said he was going to\nrecommend [her], because he [Dickerson] made sure that\n[she] wasn't on that [March 1993 transfer] list.\" (App. 162)\n\nWe hold that this evidence is sufficient to entitle a\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that Robinson was denied\na transfer to the detective bureau because she refused\nDickerson's advances. We believe that, in contrast to minor\nslights like \"negative comments,\" receiving or being denied\na desired promotion is sufficiently serious and tangible to\nconstitute a change in the employee's \"terms, conditions, or\nprivileges\" of employment.13 If the jury finds that Robinson\nwas subjected to unwelcome sexual advances and that her\nresponse to those advances was the basis for Dickerson's\nrefusal to recommend her for such a transfer, Robinson will\nhave proved that the City, through Dickerson,\ndiscriminated against her because of her sex with respect\nto the \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\" of\nher employment. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Accordingly, we\nreverse the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of\nlaw to the City on Robinson's claim under Title VII for quid\npro quo sexual harassment.14\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n13. Here, although the transfer at issue would have been a promotion,\nRobinson has not directed us to any specific evidence that the transfer\nwould have increased her compensation. Paragraph 43 of her complaint\ndoes allege that a \"transfer to the position of detective from the position\nof patrolman . . . is a promotion and carries with it an increase in\nannual compensation . . . .\" (App. 27) Moreover, there appears to have\nbeen a stipulation between the parties with respect to the difference in\npay between the detective level and the patrolman level. (App. 1310)\n\n14. The jury returned a verdict for Dickerson on Robinson's claim under\n§ 1983 against Dickerson for discriminating against her because of her\n\n                    18\n\fV.\n\nTitle VII and § 1983 Retaliation Claims Against the City,\nBuford, and Edwards\n\nRobinson contends that, after she filed her complaint\nwith the EEOC, she suffered reprisals at work. Section\n704(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), makes it \"an\nunlawful employment practice\" for \"an employer\" to\n\"discriminate\" against an employee \"because he [the\nemployee] has made a charge, testified, assisted, or\nparticipated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding,\nor hearing under [Title VII].\" Robinson sued the City for\nretaliation under the above-quoted provision of Title VII.\nShe also sued Buford and Edwards for retaliation under\n§ 1983, apparently for violating her right, secured by the\nsame provision of Title VII, to protest discrimination.\n\nIn Nelson v.

Since this claim was\nallowed to go the jury after the court granted judgment as a matter of\nlaw on Robinson's quid pro quo and retaliation theories, it would appear\nthat this claim was founded upon a hostile work environment theory. It\nis unclear from the record before us whether this claim was also founded\nupon a theory of quid pro quo harassment. If it was, our discussion in\nthis section applies equally to it, and it should be tried on remand along\nwith Robinson's Title VII quid pro quo claim against the City. (Unlike\nwith respect to the § 1983 claims against Buford, Edwards, and the City,\nthere is no legal issue regarding Dickerson's personal liability under\n§ 1983.) We of course recognize that federal pleading rules are liberal,\nbut it could be unfair for Robinson to assert a claim on remand that she\ndid not make clear in the earlier proceedings in the district court.\nCompare Appellants' Br. at 2, 4, 28 (referring to a claim under § 1983 for\nquid pro quo harassment, though apparently only against the City) with\nAppellees' Br. at 22 (noting Robinson's references to a purported § 1983\nclaim for quid pro quo harassment, but stating that the district court\n\"analyzed Robinson's quid pro quo claim under a strict Title VII\nanalysis\").

The district\ncourt granted judgment as a matter of law to defendants on\nRobinson's retaliation claims on the ground that she had\nnot presented evidence that the alleged reprisals were the\nresult of the protected activity. (App. 1029) On appeal,\nRobinson argues that the court erred in evaluating her\nevidence of retaliation. She submits that she was subjected\nto the following acts of reprisal due to the filing of her\nEEOC complaint:\n\nrestricted job duties, reassignment and subsequent\nfailure to transfer her out of an assignment in which\nshe was under the direct command of the alleged\nharasser, and the issuance of several unsubstantiated\noral reprimands against her. Additionally, she testified\nthat after refuting one of his advances, Dickerson\nsometimes would not talk to her, or would make\nunnecessary derogatory comments to her. . .

In our view, much of the allegedly retaliatory conduct\nof which Robinson complains, even if her evidence is\nbelieved, does not give rise to a claim for retaliation. The\nalleged \"unsubstantiated oral reprimands\" and\n\"unnecessary derogatory comments\" suffered by Robinson\n\n                    20\n\ffollowing her complaint do not rise to the level of what our\ncases have described as \"adverse employment action.\"\n\nTitle VII declares that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful\nemployment practice for an employer to discriminate\"\nagainst an employee \"because he has made a charge\" of\ndiscrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). Title 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000e-2(a) makes it an \"unlawful employment practice\"\n\nto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual,\nor otherwise to discriminate against any individual\nwith respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\nprivileges of employment, because of such individual's\n. . . sex . . . or to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees . . . in any way which would deprive or tend\nto deprive any individual of employment opportunities\nor otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee,\nbecause of such individual's . . . sex . . . .\n\nRetaliatory conduct other than discharge or refusal to\nrehire is thus proscribed by Title VII only if it alters the\nemployee's \"compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges\nof employment,\" deprives him or her of \"employment\nopportunities,\" or \"adversely affect[s] his [or her] status as\nan employee.\" It follows that \"not everything that makes an\nemployee unhappy\" qualifies as retaliation, for\"[o]therwise,\nminor and even trivial employment actions that `an\nirritable, chip-on-the-shoulder employee did not like would\nform the basis of a discrimination suit.' \" Smart v.

In addition, much of what Robinson characterizes as\nretaliation for her EEOC complaint is in fact alleged to have\noccurred before she filed the complaint. What Dickerson\nmay have done after Robinson \"refut[ed] one of his\nadvances\" might constitute evidence of a hostile work\nenvironment or of quid pro quo harassment, but since it\nhappened before Robinson filed her complaint, Robinson\ncannot establish a causal connection between her\ncomplaint and the conduct. What remains of Robinson's\nevidence is essentially as follows: (1) that a co-worker\nnamed Mona Wallace retaliated against Robinson by\nrestricting her computer access during the summer of 1994\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nplaintiff in the eyes of his peers \"and made it more difficult for him to\nprocure future employment\"); Sherman v.

Assuming arguendo that Wallace's\nconduct and Edwards's memo constitute \"adverse\nemployment action,\" we do not believe that Robinson\ndemonstrated the required \"causal link\" between her\ncomplaint and either Wallace's conduct or Edwards's\nmemo. Aman, 88 F.3d at 198.\n\nRobinson testified that one Saturday during the summer\nof 1994, she attempted to work on her computer but was\nunable to do so because her authorization had been\nrestricted to weekdays. (App. 240) Before that time,\nRobinson had had unrestricted computer access. (App. 240)\nWallace, who was a co-worker of Robinson's, is not\nimplicated in any way in any of the alleged sexual\nharassment. Robinson points to no evidence that anyone\nother than Wallace was involved in the decision to restrict\nher computer access, and she offers no evidence of any sort\nto show that Wallace took this action in retaliation for\nRobinson's complaint. On the contrary, Robinson relies\nmerely on a post hoc, ergo propter hoc inference from the\nfact that the restriction was imposed after Robinsonfiled\nher complaint.\n\nOur cases are seemingly split on the question whether\nthe timing of the allegedly retaliatory conduct can, by itself,\nsupport a finding of causation.

Thus,\neven if timing alone can prove causation where the\ndischarge follows only two days after the complaint, the\nmere fact that adverse employment action occurs after a\ncomplaint will ordinarily be insufficient to satisfy the\nplaintiff's burden of demonstrating a causal link between\nthe two events. See Quiroga, 934 F.2d at 501 (holding that,\n\"[a]s a matter of fact,\" the timing of Quiroga's alleged\nconstructive discharge was not independently sufficient to\nprove it was caused by his complaint). There is no evidence\nthat Wallace's restriction of Robinson's computer access\nfollowed immediately upon her complaint, so this is thus\nnot one of the extraordinary cases where the plaintiff can\ndemonstrate causation simply by pointing to the timing of\nthe allegedly retaliatory action. Accordingly, we reject\nRobinson's claim that Wallace's action constituted unlawful\nretaliation.16\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n16. Because Robinson has failed to present evidence of a causal\nconnection between her complaint and Wallace's conduct, Robinson has\nnot made out a prima facie case that Wallace's conduct constituted\nretaliation. See, e.g., Aman, 85 F.3d at 1085. Defendants therefore were\nnot required to proffer a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for\nWallace's conduct. However, they did so, presenting evidence that\nWallace restricted Robinson's access because Robinson had been\ncommitting security breaches (for example, by bringing files home) and\nthat Wallace took this action entirely on her own. (App. 562-66, 579) If\ndefendants were obligated to proffer such an explanation, Robinson\nwould then have the burden of presenting evidence from which a\nreasonable jury could conclude either that \"the articulated reason is a\npretext for the retaliation or that a discriminatory reason more likely\nmotivated the employer.\" Delli Santi, 88 F.3d at 199. Robinson has not\npointed to any implausibilities, inconsistencies, contradictions,\nincoherencies, or the like in Wallace's testimony, see Sheridan, 100 F.3d\nat 1072, and has not even attempted to explain why the jury should\n\n                    25\n\fA similar analysis applies to the \"ten-car memo\" written\nby Edwards in June 1994. Before that time, Robinson had\nbeen assigned to the \"ten-car\" (a drug suppression vehicle)\nbut had been detailed to criminal intelligence where she\nworked under Bochter. Dickerson was in charge of the ten-\ncar but had no supervisory authority over the criminal\nintelligence unit. The ten-car memo states that \"due to the\nincreased activity in the downtown area and with the\nending of the school year, the need for the extra assistance\nthat the ten car provides has increased. Due to these facts,\neffective immediately, all personnel assigned to a ten car is\n[sic] to be immediately informed that they will ride the\nvehicle that they are assigned to.\" (App. 237)\n\nRobinson seeks to portray this memo as a pretextual\nattempt to force her to work under Dickerson after having\nfiled a complaint against him. However, it is undisputed\nthat the memo was not applied to Robinson; she remained\nin the criminal intelligence unit from June 1994 (when the\nmemo was circulated) until October 1994, when she\nstopped reporting for work. (App. 239-40, 249-50) Again,\nRobinson attempts to link the ten-car memo to her\ncomplaint simply by pointing to the temporal sequence of\nthe two events, but in light of the circumstances noted\nabove, this is insufficient. There is consequently no basis\nfor a finding that the ten-car memo constituted retaliation\nagainst Robinson for her complaint of discrimination.\n\nRobinson's final argument is that the jury would have\nbeen entitled to return a verdict for her on her retaliation\nclaim if it had agreed that she was subjected to a hostile\nwork environment. She relies on our statement in Aman\nthat \"an atmosphere of condoned sexual harassment in the\nworkplace increases the likelihood of retaliation for\ncomplaints in individual cases,\" 85 F.3d at 1086, but that\n_________________________________________________________________\n\ndisbelieve Wallace. Nor does the record itself suggest any such reason.\nRather than showing that Wallace was in league with Dickerson or\nmanagement generally, the record in fact reveals that Wallace\naccompanied Robinson to the EEOC as \"moral support\" when Robinson\nfiled her complaint. (App. 560) We therefore hold, in the alternative, that\nRobinson failed to present evidence undermining defendants' proffered\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for the challenged conduct.\n\n                    26\n\fstatement is merely an empirical prediction; it is not a legal\ntheory that obviates the presentation of actual evidence of\nretaliation. In Hawkins v. Hennepin Technical Center, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539256\"><a href=\"/opinion/539256/linda-j-hawkins-v-hennepin-technical-center-joint-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156 (8th Cir. 1990), the source of the cited\nstatement from Aman, the court held that the plaintiff\nshould have been allowed to present evidence of the\ndefendant's prior acts of sexual harassment, even if those\nacts were not independently actionable, in order to cast\ndoubt upon the credibility of the defendant's proffered\nlegitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for the allegedly\nretaliatory conduct. Id. at 155-56. In Hawkins, the plaintiff\nhad enough evidence of retaliation to get to the jury even\nwithout the evidence of \"condoned sexual harassment,\" so\nthe court's decision cannot be read as upholding the\nargument that Robinson urges upon us here.17\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n17. In Glass v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677336\"><a href=\"/opinion/677336/harold-glass-v-philadelphia-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (3d Cir. 1994),\nwe quoted the Eighth Circuit's statement in Hawkins with approval in\nsupport of the proposition that evidence that Glass had been subjected\nto racial harassment during a time period for which he received an\nunfavorable performance rating was relevant to show that that rating\nwas of questionable validity and thus that the employer's reliance on\nthat rating in denying Glass certain promotions was pretextual.\nTherefore, like Hawkins itself, Glass does not support the view that\nevidence that the employer condoned sexual harassment suffices to\nprove the element of the employee's prima facie case requiring a causal\nlink between his or her complaint and a subsequent adverse employment\naction.\n\nIn Woodson, we stated that evidence that the employer condoned a\nharasser's conduct can contribute to an inference that subsequent\nadverse employment action taken by the harasser against the plaintiff\nwas causally linked to the plaintiff's complaint about the harassment.\n109 F.3d at 922. This observation rests upon the recognition that, if the\nharasser got away with the harassment, it is more likely that he or she\nwill believe that retaliation will be safe as well, and conversely, if the\nemployer took prompt and adequate action against the harasser, the\nharasser will be less confident of his or her ability to engage in\nretaliation with impunity. In this case, however, Robinson does not\ncontend that Dickerson -- the alleged harasser-- took any retaliatory\naction against her.\n\nIn any event, we made it clear in Woodson that this sort of evidence\nwas not independently sufficient to support an inference of causation.\nSee id. at 921. Whereas Woodson presented other extensive evidence,\nRobinson seeks to rely solely on evidence that Dickerson subjected her\n\n                    27\n\fIn light of the foregoing, we affirm the district court's\ngrant of judgment as a matter of law to defendants on\nRobinson's Title VII and § 1983 retaliation claims.18\n\nVI.\n\nJury Instruction on Employer Liability\n\nThe district court denied the City's motion for judgment\nas a matter of law as to Robinson's claim under Title VII for\na hostile work environment, and the jury returned a verdict\nfor the City. Robinson contends that this verdict must be\nupset because the court erred in its instruction to the jury\non the issue of employer respondeat superior liability under\nTitle VII for hostile environment sexual harassment.19 As we\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nto a hostile work environment and that the City failed to take prompt\nand adequate action to remedy the harassment. If we were to uphold\nRobinson's argument, every employee who succeeds on a hostile\nenvironment claim would be able to prove a causal link between his or\nher complaint of harassment and any subsequent adverse employment\naction. We do not believe that actual proof of retaliatory motive can be\ndispensed with so easily.\n\n18. In addition to the grounds described in the text, which apply equally\nto Robinson's Title VII retaliation claim and her§ 1983 retaliation claim,\nwe hold that judgment as a matter of law was properly granted in favor\nof Edwards and Buford on Robinson's § 1983 retaliation claim on the\nground that neither Edwards nor Buford was personally involved in any\nretaliation. See Part III, supra. We also affirm the grant of judgment as\na matter of law to the City on the § 1983 retaliation claim on the\nadditional ground that there was no evidence of a municipal policy or\ncustom encouraging or permitting retaliation. See Part III.C, supra.\n\n19. In order to prevail on a claim under Title VII for a hostile work\nenvironment based on sex, an employee must prove that: \"(1) he or she\nsuffered intentional discrimination because of his or her sex; (2) the\ndiscrimination was pervasive and regular; (3) the discrimination\ndetrimentally affected the plaintiff; (4) the discrimination would\ndetrimentally affect a reasonable person of the same sex in that position;\nand (5) respondeat superior liability existed.\" Knabe v.

It is important for you, the jury, to\nunderstand that the City of Pittsburgh may only be\nheld liable for the existence of a sexually hostile\nworking environment that results from its own\nnegligence. The City may not be held liable simply\nbecause one of its employees engaged in sexual\nharassment.\n\nThus, if the City of Pittsburgh had an effective\nprocedure for handling sexual harassment complaints\nat the time of the alleged incidents, the City was not\n\n                     29\n\fnegligent and it cannot be held liable for the improper\nconduct of its employees.\n\nIn order to determine whether the City of Pittsburgh\nwas negligent in this case, you must decide whether its\nsexual harassment procedure was effective. A sexual\nharassment procedure is effective if it is both known to\nthe victim of sexual harassment and its [sic] use of the\nprocedure timely stops the harassment.\n\n(App. 1331-32). Robinson timely objected to this charge\n(App. 1310-11, 1314-15), arguing that \"I think we've shown\nevidence where there was not an effective procedure.. . .\n[U]nder the facts of this case you can't presume there was\nan effective procedure, because the procedure required\nChief Edwards to take action, and he didn't.\" The court\nresponded that it was not, in fact, \"presuming\" that the\nCity had an effective anti-harassment procedure, and stated\nthat \"[i]t's the jury's job to decide whether it was effective or\nnot.\" (App. 1311) We exercise plenary review over the jury\ninstructions in order to determine whether, read as a\nwhole, they stated the correct legal standard. Miller v.\nCIGNA Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689132\"><a href=\"/opinion/689132/william-j-miller-v-cigna-corporation-the-insurance-company-of-north/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 591 (3d Cir. 1995) (en banc).\n\nIn Bouton, the case upon which the district court relied\nin its jury charge, we held that \"under negligence\nprinciples, prompt and effective action by the employer will\nrelieve it of liability.\" Bouton, 29 F.3d at 107 (emphasis\nadded). Robinson argues that the charge based on Bouton\nwas inappropriate because the complaint in that case did\nend the harassment, while her complaint did not. According\nto Robinson, the court should have based its jury\ninstruction on Andrews, a case where the complaint did not\nput a stop to the harassment. Robinson's argument is\nnothing more than a contention that the City's action in\nthis case was not \"effective.\" But whether Robinson's\ncomplaint put a stop to the harassment -- and whether any\nharassment occurred in the first place -- were factual\nissues committed to the jury. The basic problem with\nRobinson's argument is that it challenges the jury's verdict,\nnot the court's charge.\n\nRobinson contends that, even if the City put an end to\nthe harassment by transferring Dickerson following her\n\n                     30\n\fMay 1994 complaint, the City should have taken such\naction in 1992 when she first spoke to Edwards about\nDickerson's \"hitting on her.\" But Robinson argued at trial\nthat her 1992 conversation with Edwards constituted an\nattempt to avail herself of the City's anti-harassment\nprocedure, and that the City failed to respond adequately to\nher complaint. (App. 1405) If the jury had believed that the\n1992 conversation had taken place and that Robinson had\nmade it sufficiently clear to Edwards that she was\ncomplaining about conduct that she perceived as sexual\nharassment, the jury could have held the City liable. That\nit did not do so is not a basis to attack the charge.\nRobinson's argument, both as quoted above in her\nobjection to the charge in the district court and on appeal,\nruns more like an argument in favor of judgment as a\nmatter of law that the City did not take adequate remedial\naction once it learned of the harassment than a challenge\nto a jury instruction. Robinson did not move for such a\njudgment, however, and it is plain that no such judgment\nwould have been warranted in view of the evidentiary\ndisputes regarding whether the harassment occurred and\nwhen the City found out about it. As the district court put\nit, \"it's the jury's job to decide whether [the City's anti-\nharassment procedure] was effective or not.\" We reject\nRobinson's argument that the Bouton charge was\ninappropriate on the facts of her case, because it was for\nthe jury in its verdict, not the court in its charge, to decide\nwhat the facts of this case were.20\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n20. After the trial in this case, we decided Knabe v. The Boury Corp., ___\nF.3d ____, 1997 Wl 282905 (3d Cir.). As noted above, in Bouton we\narticulated the standard as whether the employer's remedial action was\n\"effective.\" See 29 F.3d at 107. In Andrews, we phrased the standard\nsomewhat differently, stating that the employer will be liable if its\nremedial action was not \"adequate.\" See 895 F.2d at 1486. If there was\nany conflict between the \"adequacy\" standard expressed in Andrews and\nthe \"effectiveness\" standard set forth in Bouton, Knabe has resolved it. In\nKnabe, we rejected the plaintiff's argument that an employer is liable\nunless it took remedial action that was actually \"effective\" to put a stop\nto the harassment in the particular case at hand. We held instead that\na remedial action is \"adequate\" if it was \"reasonably calculated to\nprevent further harassment,\" whether or not it actually succeeded in\ndoing so. Id. at __, *5 (citations omitted). See also id. at __, *4 n.8.\nTherefore, the charge in this case arguably misled the jury into believing\nthat the City's response had to be actually effective. Of course, in view\nof the jury's verdict for the City, no prejudice flowed from this possible\nerror.\n\n                    31\n\fVII.\n\nAfter the district court granted defendants' motion for\njudgment as a matter of law on Robinson's quid pro quo\nharassment and retaliation claims, defendants' counsel\nasked the court to remove from the record certain exhibits\nthat \"were offered with relation to those claims.\" (App.\n1307). The court then went through the exhibits in\nquestion with counsel and excluded all but two of them.\n(App. 1308-13) Later, in charging the jury, the court listed\nthe claims that it had \"disposed of\" and told the jury that\n\"these claims are of no concern to you. The evidence you\nheard concerning these claims is no longer relevant and\nshould not be considered by you.\" (App. 1326) On appeal,\nRobinson argues that these evidentiary rulings and this\nstatement were erroneous because evidence of quid pro quo\nharassment and retaliation, even if it does not concern\nconduct that is serious enough to be independently\nactionable on a quid pro quo or a retaliation theory, may\nnevertheless be relevant to show a hostile work\nenvironment. These errors, she submits, require reversal of\nthe jury's verdict in favor of the City on her Title VII hostile\nenvironment claim.\n\nWe need not consider this argument, because we do not\nbelieve that Robinson raised it in the district court. Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 46 requires \"that a party, at the time the ruling or\norder of the court is made or sought, make[ ] known to the\ncourt the action which the party desires the court to take\nor the party's objection to the action of the court and the\ngrounds therefor.\" We conclude that, while Robinson may\nhave made a timely objection to the evidentiary exclusions\nthat she contests, she at no time made known to the\ndistrict court the ground that she now presses in this\ncourt.\n\nAs noted, the court analyzed each exhibit that defendants\nsought to exclude. For most of the exhibits mentioned\nduring that process, plaintiffs' counsel voiced no objection,\nand neither of the two objections that he did raise related\nto the argument described above upon which Robinson now\nrelies. First, plaintiffs' counsel objected to the exclusion of\nexhibit 57-X, arguing that it was relevant to undermine the\ncredibility of a witness named Gail Payne by showing \"her\n\n                     32\n\fmotive in giving testimony the way she did and what she\nsaid.\" (App. 1308) The court disagreed, and removed the\nexhibit from the record. Next, counsel argued that exhibit\n78 was relevant to show that the City's response to\nRobinson's complaint of harassment was ineffective. (App.\n1310) The court disagreed, stating that the exhibit only\n\"has to do with retaliation.\" (App. 1311) Robinson does not\nrenew either of these objections on appeal. After the court\nand counsel had gone through all of the exhibits at issue,\nplaintiffs' counsel stated that \"[t]o make the record clear,\nYour Honor, I would just like to for the record, to formally\nobject to the Court's ruling based on the Bouton case and\nthe evidentiary rulings you just made.\" (App. 1315) Counsel\noffered no further explanation of the grounds for this\nobjection.\n\nSubsequently, in charging the jury, the court made the\nstatement quoted above that Robinson now challenges.\nAfter completing the jury charge, the court told counsel at\nsidebar that \"[n]ow is your opportunity to put exceptions to\nthe charge on record.\" (App. 1348) Plaintiffs' counsel did\nnot mention the challenged statement, and did not\notherwise make known the argument that Robinson now\nmakes on appeal.\n\nWe therefore conclude that plaintiffs' counsel never gave\nthe district court any reason to believe that he was making\nthe argument that evidence of quid pro quo harassment\nand retaliation, even if not actionable on those theories,\nwas nevertheless relevant to show a hostile work\nenvironment. Because Robinson did not raise that\nargument in the district court, we decline to consider it on\nappeal.21\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n21. Robinson argues that the court erred in refusing to allow her to\npresent evidence that the City transferred officers to the detective bureau\non the basis of nepotism and favoritism, in violation of its written\npolicies. We find no error in the district court's ruling that the proffered\nevidence could not give rise to a reasonable inference of discrimination\nbecause of sex. Finally, Robinson challenges the court's refusal to admit\nthe report prepared by the City's Office of Professional Responsibility\nthat found that Dickerson had created an \"uncomfortable\" work\nenvironment for another woman. The court allowed Robinson to elicit the\n\n                    33\n\fVIII.\n\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the\ndistrict court's grant of defendants' motion for judgment as\na matter of law with respect to Robinson's claims under\n§ 1983 against Buford, Edwards, and the City for sex\ndiscrimination and retaliation and Robinson's claim under\nTitle VII against the City for retaliation. We reverse the\ngrant of judgment as a matter of law with respect to\nRobinson's claim under Title VII for quid pro quo sexual\nharassment against the City and remand for trial of that\nclaim. On remand, the district court should ascertain\nwhether Robinson seeks to pursue a claim under § 1983 for\nquid pro quo harassment against Dickerson, and if so,\nwhether she should be permitted to do so in light of the\nprior proceedings in this case. See n.14, supra. In all other\nrespects, we affirm the district court's rulings and its entry\nof judgment upon the jury's verdict.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\nClerk of the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Third Circuit\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nreport's conclusions as admissions by the City, but excluded the report\nitself as irrelevant. Robinson contends that the report shows notice to\nthe City of Dickerson's alleged harassment of her. We find no error here\nas well. The conduct on the part of Dickerson discussed in the report is\nnot his alleged harassment of Robinson, so the report in no way put the\nCity on notice that Dickerson was harassing Robinson.\n\n                    34\n\f</pre>",
