We conclude the trial court did not abuse its\n\nbroad discretion or fail to apply the relevant legal factors and affirm.\n\fNo. 31951·2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Julio Flores and Florentina Flores married in April 1993 and separated in\n\nSeptember 2010. The couple have four daughters ages 18,17,14, and 13. Mr. Flores\n\nowns JR's Heating and Air Services (JR's). Mainly, the parties disputed the business\n\nvaluation and the extent of Mr. Flores' income. Ms. Flores works at Prosser School\n\nDistrict and harvests cherries during the summer. Generally, the court received\n\nextensive evidence on all issues, decided the disputed factual issues within the range of\n\npresented evidence, and correctly applied disputed legal factors.\n\n      First, regarding the business valuation, in 1996, Mr. and Ms. Flores started JR's\n\nas a sole proprietorship. JR's pre-tax income showed: $30,000 in 2006; $12,622 in\n\n2007; -$5,510 in 2008; $3,505 in 2009; and -$2,433 in 2010. Retained earnings for JR's\n\nshowed: $90,613 in 2009; $121,286 in 2010; and $96,828 in 2011. In 2011, Mr. Flores\n\nstarted using QuickBooks to record his income and expenses. In preparing Mr. Flores'\n\n2011 tax returns, income errors were discovered neceSSitating an amended return.\n\nCertified Public Accountant (CPA) Joseph Reid, with business valuation accreditation,\n\nprepared business valuation reports for ,.IR's and was Ms. Flores' witness.\n\n      Initially, in a first report, Mr. Reid used the tax returns from 2006-2011, bank\n\nstatements, invoices, and an on-site meeting with Mr. Flores. Using multiple valuation\n\napproaches including the market approach, the asset approach, the capitalization\n\napproach, and the discounting cash flow approach, Mr. Reid concluded JR's value at\n\n$65,000. Later in a second report, Mr. Reid discovered discrepancies in the\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nQuickBooks files obtained from Mr. Flores and recalculated •.IR's value and Mr. Flores'\n\nincome. Using Mr. Flores' mark-up of 65 percent for goods sold and an hourly labor\n\nrate of $85, he calculated JR's gross revenue for 2011 at $228,099. He compared this\n\nvalue to $222,348, the gross revenue calculated using the national average mark-up for\n\nheating and air companies as determined by the Risk Management Association.\n\nAveraging the two, Mr. Reid determined JR's gross revenue for 2011 was $225,224.\n\nHe calculated 2011 net profits at $18,000 after explaining his calculations, then valued\n\nthe business at $100,000. He estimated Mr. Flores' annual salary as $60,000,\n\nexplaining his calculations. The $18,000 net profit was consistent with the profit\n\nanticipated for the amended 2011 tax return. JR's pre-tax income in 2012 was\n\nanticipated to be $47,000.\n\n      The court determined JR's value to be $82,500, the median value between the\n\ninitial valuation and the second valuation, and awarded the asset to Mr. Flores. The\n\ncourt denied Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration, which included his amended 2011\n\ntax return and 2012 tax return.\n\n      Second, regarding Mr. Flores' income, in his second report, Mr. Reid added the\n\nestimated salary ($60,000) and net profit ($18,000) to determine Mr. Flores' annual\n\nincome at $78,000. Brian Newhouse, Mr. Flores' accountant, testified he could not\n\naccurately determine Mr. Flores' income based on the existing documentation. But in a\n\n2007 loan application to refinance his home mortgage, Mr. Flores declared his monthly\n\nincome to be $10,000. And in a 2012 loan application to buy a work van, Mr. Flores\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nindicated his annual income was $100,000. The court accepted Mr. Reid's estimation of\n\nMr. Flores' income at $78,000. The court denied Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration,\n\nwhich included his amended 2011 tax return and 2012 tax return.\n\n       Third, regarding the 2011 Harley Street Glide Motorcycle, Ms. Flores testified she\n\nsaw Mr. Flores driving a 2011 Harley Street Glide and valued the motorcycle at\n\n$20,000. Mr. Flores stated the motorcycle belonged to his brother, however, Mr. Flores\n\nmaintained insurance on it and bought parts for the Street Glide. The court found Mr.\n\nFlores owned the Street Glide, valued it at $20,748, and awarded it to Mr. Flores. The\n\ncourt denied Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration, which included the motorcycle's\n\nregistration and a statement from his brother, Luis Flores, declaring Luis as the owner of\n\nthe Street Glide.\n\n       Fourth, regarding the Yolanda Flores' obligation, Mr. Flores' mother purchased a\n\nmobile home for $12,000 and made improvements. In 1998, Yolanda sold the parties\n\nland and the mobile home in exchange for them repaying a $30,000 loan to Paul Rupp.\n\nYolanda and Mr. Flores testified Mr. Flores also agreed to pay an additional $33,500 to\n\nYolanda. Ms. Flores was unaware of this second obligation. Yolanda later executed\n\nand recorded a deed which indicated the land was a gift. Mr. Flores stated the \"gift\"\n\ndesignation allowed them to avoid paying excise taxes. The obligation to Mr. Rupp was\n\npaid in full by 2003. After separation, Mr. Flores withdrew $130,000 from their joint\n\nsavings account. He gave his mother $34,000. In January 2011, the court ordered Mr.\n\nFlores to put the money into an account and provide an accounting of any money spent.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nMr. Flores deposited $96,000 and said he used $34,000 for business expenses. Nine\n\nmonths later, Mr. Flores produced a handwritten note from his mother stating her son\n\ngave her $34,000 to pay for the land and the mobile home. The court found Mr. Flores\n\ntook $34,000 from the savings account. The court denied Mr. Flores' motion for\n\nreconsideration, stating it did not find eit~er Mr. Flores' or Yolanda's testimony credible.\n\n       Fifth, the court's decree addressed property.division, maintenance, child support,\n\nand attorney fees and costs. The court awarded Ms. Flores 55 percent of the assets\n\nand Mr. Flores 45 percent. The court found Ms. Flores had the need for maintenance\n\nand Mr. Flores had the ability to pay. The court determined monthly child support\n\npayments for the three minor children at $1,919. It set maintenance at $1,500 per\n\nmonth for 84 months. The court awarded Ms. Flores expert witness fees for the\n\nbusiness valuation appraisal, personal property appraisal fees, and attorney fees.\n\n                                    Standard of Review\n\n      [T]rial court decisions in a dissolution action will seldom be changed upon\n      appeal. Such decisions are difficult at best. Appellate courts should not\n      encourage appeals by tinkering with them. The emotional and financial\n                                                                                               I\n      interests affected by such decisions are best served by finality. The\n      spouse who challenges such decisions bears the heavy burden of\n      showing a manifest abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court. The\n      trial court's decision will be affirmed unless no reasonable judge would\n      have reached the same conclusion.\n\nIn re Marriage of Landry, 103 Wn.2d 807, 809-10, 699 P.2d 214 (1985) (internal\n\ncitations omitted); see also In re Marriage of Knies, 96 Wn. App. 243, 253,979 P.2d 482\n\n(1999) (\"Discretion is abused where it is exercised on untenable grounds or for\n\nuntenable reasons.\").\n\n\n                                             5\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n                                        ANALYSIS\n\n                     A. Business Valuation and Mr. Flores' Income\n\n       The issue is whether substantial evidence supports both the superior court's\n\nconclusions for JR's business valuation and Mr. Flores' income. Mr. Flores contends\n\nMr. Reid's expert opinions for business value and his income were based on\n\nspeculation and assumption and lacked evidentiary value.\n\n       \"Goodwill is a property or asset which usually supplements the earning capacity\n\nof another asset, a business or a profession.\" In re Marriage of Hall, 103 Wn.2d 236,\n\n241,692 P.2d 175 (1984). The value of goodwill is a question of fact. Id. at 246. To\n\nvalue goodwill, at least one accepted valuation method must be used. In re Marriage of\n\nLuckey, 73 Wn. App. 201, 206,868 P.2d 189 (1994); see Hall, 103 Wn.2d at 243-45\n\n(listing as acceptable methods straight capitalization, capitalization of excess earnings,\n\nthe IRS variation of capitalized excess earnings, market value, and buy/sell agreement).\n\n\"Findings of fact supported by substantial evidence in the record will not be reversed on\n\nappeal.\" Hall, 103 Wn.2d at 246. \"Substantial evidence is evidence sufficient to\n\npersuade a fair-minded person of the truth of the declared premise.\" Id.\n\n      A trial court's failure to \"state on the record which factors and accounting method\n\nwere used in arriving at its finding ... will deem the valuation to be unsupported oy\n\nsufficient evidence, necessitating reversal and remand for proper findings.\" In re\n\nMarriage ofCrosetto, 82 Wn. App. 545,554,918 P.2d 954 (1996). But if a credible\n\nexpert testifies his valuation is based on acceptable accounting methods and a trial\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\ncourt adopts that valuation or a valuation within the range of expert testimony. the trial\n\ncourt's valuation is supported by substantial evidence and will be affirmed on appeal. In\n\nre Marriage of Harrington, 85 Wn. App. 613, 637, 935 P.2d 1357 (1997). 'To rule\n\notherwise would be to place the appellate courts in the position of weighing expert\n\ntestimony.\" In re Marriage of Sedlock, 69 Wn. App. 484, 491, 849 P.2d 1243 (1993).\n\nInstead, appellate courts look \"to the reasonableness of the trial court's bottom line\n\nresult, in light of all the expert testimony.\" Id. An expert's opinion cannot be \"based on\n\nassumptions for which there was no factual basis.\" Riccobono v. Pierce County, 92 Wn.\n\nApp. 254, 268, 966 P.2d 327 (1998).\n\n       In computing income, absent a business necessity for retaining the earnings, trial\n\ncourts may consider as income a business' retained earnings in addition to the profit\n\nreported on tax returns. In re Marriage of Stenshoel, 72 Wn. App. 800,806-07,866\n\nP.2d 635 (1993). Mr. Reid, a CPA with accreditation in business valuation, used\n\nseveral legally acceptable methods to value JR's. He reviewed JR's tax returns for the\n\nprevious seven years, bank statements, billable hours, hourly rates, cost of goods sold,\n\nthe reputation of JR's, and past earnings to calculate JR's value in 2011. Mr. Reid's net\n\nprofit calculation was slightly lower than the actual profit seen in the amended 2011 tax\n\nreturn. As Mr. Reid's two valuation reports were admitted into evidence, the court\n\nchose a value in the middle of the two valuations. The court's finding regarding ..IR's\n\nvalue was thus supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n       In calculating JR's profit, Mr. Reid estimated Mr. Flores' annual salary at\n\n$60,000. Given the lack of income records, Mr. Reid reasonably estimated income by\n\ntaking into account the need to retain a profit for the business. what it would take to hire\n\nsomeone to perform Mr. Flores' job, and certain risk factors. Mr. Reid added JR's net\n\nprofit to the estimated salary for a final income of $78,000. This amount is below Mr.\n\nFlores' multiple representations that his income was $100,000 or more a year. Notably,\n\nJR's consistently had over $90,000 per year in retained earnings. In the end. the court\n\naccepted Mr. Reid's testimony over Mr. Flores' regarding both the value of JR's and Mr.\n\nFlores' income. The trial court, not the appellate court, decides evidence weight and\n\nwitness credibility.\n\n       Even if we disagreed with the superior court, the question is whether tenable\n\ngrounds and tenable reason existed. The court determined JR's value and Mr. Flores'\n\nincome based on Mr. Reid's calculations. Mr. Reid relied on extensive facts and case\n\nlaw. Mr. Reid has been valuing businesses for a number of years. The court's\n\nvaluation of JR's and income computation were well within the range of evidence.\n\n       Additionally, the superior court acted within its discretion in denying Mr. Flores'\n\nreconsideration motion. A motion for reconsideration may be brought for the reasons in\n\nCR 59(a).1 We do not reverse reconsideration rulings without a manifest abuse of\n\n\n\n       1 Mr. Flores contends the following grounds merit granting his motion for\nreconsideration on all issues: \"[a]ccident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not\n                                                                                               f\nhave guarded against\"; U[n]ewly discovered evidence, material for the party making the\napplication, which he could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and\nproduced at the trial\"; \"[t]hat there is no evidence or reasonable inference from the\n                                                                                               Il\n                                             8\n                                                                                               I\n                                                                                               I\n                                                                                               f\n                                                                                               i\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\ndiscretion.

Newly discovered evidence is not \"evidence presented for the\n\nfirst time in a motion for reconsideration\" unless the party shows he could not have\n\nobtained the evidence earlier. Id.\n\n       In Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration on JR's value and his income, the sole\n\nnew evidence claimed was his amended 2011 tax return and his 2012 tax return. The\n\namended 2011 tax return merely reinforced Mr. Newhouse's trial testimony regarding\n\nJR's profit. Mr. Newhouse testified about expected profit for 2012. As Mr. Flores'\n\nincome could not be determined from JR's prior tax returns, nothing indicates these new              f\n                                                                                                     t\n                                                                                                     ¥\ntax returns would shed light on the issue. The superior court's findings were reasonable\n\ninferences from the evidence. Given all, we conclude the superior court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in denying Mr. Flores' reconsideration motion.\n\n                                   B. Disputed Motorcycle\n\n       The issue is whether the superior court erred in determining Mr. Flores owned\n\nthe 2011 Harley Street Glide and in denying Mr. Flores' reconsideration motion. Mr.\n\nFlores contends the evidence showed his brother, Luis, was the owner.\n\n       An appellate court's \"role or function is not to substitute [its] judgment for that of\n\nthe trial court or to weigh the evidence or credibility of witnesses.\" Sedlock, 69 Wn.\n\n\nevidence to justify the verdict or the decision, or that it is contrary to law\"; and \"[t]hat\nsubstantial justice has not been done.\" CR 59(a)(3), (4), (7), (9).\n                                                                                                ,\n                                               9                                                t\n                                                                                                I\n                                                                                                ~.\n                                                                                                f\n                                                                                                r\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nApp. at 491. The superior court gave the documentation of Mr. Flores' insurance policy\n\non the motorcycle and testimony of Ms. Flores more weight than the testimonies of Mr.\n\nFlores and his mother. This is clearly an issue of weighing evidence and credibility of\n\nwitnesses for the trial court. As for Mr. Flores' reconsideration request, he argues he\n\nhad no indication the superior court did not believe his testimony and substantial justice\n\nwas not done. But Mr. Flores did not show Luis was unavailable to testify at trial or\n\ndemonstrate Luis' testimony would be persuasive to the court. Accordingly, we\n\nconclude the superior court did not err in denying the reconsideration motion.\n\n                             C. Yolanda Flores' Obligation\n\n      The issue is whether the superior court erred in awarding Mr. Flores $34,000 as\n\nan asset and denying his reconsideration motion. Mr. Flores contends this money\n\nconstituted community funds used to pay community debt.\n\n      We defer to trial court credibility determinations, and we will not reweigh\n\nconflicting evidence. Keene Valley Ventures v. Richland, 174 Wn. App. 219, 224, 298\n\nP.3d 121, review denied, 178 Wn.2d 1020 (2013). While Mr. Flores' and Yolanda's\n\ntestimony could evidence a community debt, the court was not required to find that\n\ntestimony persuasive. Instead, the court determined Ms. Flores' testimony, combined\n\nwith documentation of the satisfaction of lien and loan documents, were more credible.\n\nEven though the evidence could have supported a finding in Mr. Flores' favor, we do not\n\nreweigh evidence; the superior court did not err. Mr. Flores asserted no new evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                           10 \n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nor contrary law in his reconsideration motion. Thus, the superior court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion.\n\n                                D. Spousal Maintenance\n\n      The issue is whether the superior court abused its discretion in awarding Ms.\n\nFlores spousal maintenance of $1,500 per month for 84 months. Mr. Flores contends\n\nthe superior court failed to correctly apply the statutory factors seen in RCW 26.09.090,\n\nresulting in Ms. Flores' unjust enrichment. He mainly argues the comt failed to consider\n\nhis financial resources when making the award.\n\n      A trial court is given broad discretion in awarding maintenance to address the\n\nparties' circumstances. Bulicek v. Bulicek, 59 Wn. App. 630, 634, 800 P.2d 394 (1990).\n\nThe sole limitation on a maintenance award under the RCW 26.09:090 factors is justice.\n\nId. Factors to be considered include: the financial resources of the spouse seeking\n\nmaintenance, including community property apportioned her, and her ability to meet her\n\nneeds independently; the time needed to acquire education to enable that party to find\n\nappropriate employment; the standard of living established during the marriage; the\n\nduration of the marriage; the age, physical and emotional condition, and financial\n\nobligations of the spouse seeking maintenance; and the ability of the other spouse to\n\nmeet his needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance. RCW\n\n29.09.090. The trial court's paramount concern should be \"the economic condition in\n\nwhich the dissolution decree leaves the parties.\" In re Marriage of Williams, 84 Wn.\n\nApp. 263, 268, 927 P.2d 679 (1996).\n\n\n\n                                           11 \n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n       Here, the court considered the RCW 26.09.090 factors and decided maintenance\n\nwas required under the circumstances. The court split the community assets 55/45\n\nbecause of Mr. Flores' ability to earn more income than Ms. Flores. Ms. Flores' income\n\nwill remain steady at approximately $1,350 per month. Ms. Flores was awarded\n\napproximately $250,000 in community property, including $28,700 in her pension plan,\n\n$96,000 in cash, and $18,000 in equity in the house. She had to take over making\n\npayments on the $158,000 mortgage, $20,000 of which was a business loan for JR's.\n\nMs. Flores estimated her household expenses for herself and her four daughters was\n\n$5,600 per month. Ms. Flores has no current plans to pursue education.\n\nComparatively, Mr. Flores' income increased over a three-year period, from a loss of\n\n$3,000 in 2010 to a profit of $49,000 in 2012. He estimated his monthly expenses at\n\n$1,600. The court found Mr. Flores \"ha[d] been able to continually purchase non­\n\nessential items, such as motorcycle parts.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 5.\n\n       Based on the above, the length of the marriage, and ascribing an annual income\n\nof $78,000 to Mr. Flores, the court ordered Mr. Flores to pay $1,500 per month for 84\n\nmonths as maintenance. This maintenance award lasts two years after the youngest\n\ndaughter graduates from high school, so Ms. Flores could return to school if she\n\ndesires. The court ordered Mr. Flores to pay $1,919 per month in child support.\n\nAddition of child support and maintenance results in approximately $3,500 per month, a\n\nlittle more than half of Mr. Flores' gross monthly income. After subtracting Mr. Flores'\n\nmonthly expenses, he is left with a little under $1,500 in discretionary income, which is\n\n\n\n                                            12 \n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nfar more than what Ms. Flores realizes. Thus, after the court's consideration of the\n\nrelevant statutory factors, we cannot say the superior court's discretion in awarding\n\nmaintenance was based on untenable grounds or manifestly unreasonable.\n\n                       E. Superior Court Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       The issue is whether the superior court erred in awarding attorney fees and\n\ninvestigation costs to Ms. Flores. Mr. Flores contends the court failed to consider the\n\nliquid assets it awarded to Ms. Flores in the property division in ascertaining her need\n\nfor attorney fees and costs.\n\n      The trial court's decision to award attorney fees and costs in a dissolution action\n\nis discretionary. In re Marriage of Mattson, 95 Wn. App. 592, 604, 976 P.2d 157 (1999).\n\nRCW 26.09.140 requires the trial court to \"balance the needs of the spouse requesting\n\nthem with the ability of the other spouse to pay.\" Mansour v. Mansour, 126 Wn. App. 1,\n\n16-17,106 P.3d 768 (2004) (no error in trial court's refusal to award wife attorney fees\n\nwhere wife could pay fees with money received from selling the house). A spouse is not\n\nprecluded from receiving an award of attorney fees and costs because she also\n\nreceived substantial property or maintenance. In re Marriage of Morrow, 53 Wn. App.\n\n579,590,770 P.2d 197 (1989).\n\n      The court distributed 55 percent of the property to Ms. Flores and found she had\n\na need for an award of attorney fees and costs while Mr. Flores had the ability to pay.\n\nMr. Flores has a higher earning power than Ms. Flores: Ms. Flores' income is one-fourth\n\nof Mr. Flores and, unlike Mr. Flores', is without the capacity to grow. Mr. Flores had\n\n\n\n                                            13 \n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nbeen able \"to continually purchase non-essential items, such as motorcycle parts,\n\nduring the pendency of the dissolution.\" CP at 46. Even with the maintenance and\n\nchild support, Ms. Flores does not have enough money for her monthly expenses. On\n\nthe other hand, Mr. Flores' net monthly calculated income is $5.158. When subtracting\n\nhis monthly maintenance. child support, and personal expenses, he is left with\n\napproximately $150 per month, or $1,800 per year.\n\n       If one spouse's intransigence caused the spouse seeking the award to incur\n\nadditional legal services, \"the financial resources of the spouse seeking the award are\n\nirrelevant.\" In re Marriage of Greenlee, 65 Wn. App. 703, 708, 829 P.2d 1120 (1992).\n\nExamples of intransigent conduct includes obstructionist behavior, filing repetitive or\n\nunnecessary motions, and attempting to make the proceeding unduly difficult with\n\nincreased legal costs. Id. Unless intranSigence was seen throughout the entire\n\nproceedings, fee awards should be segregated to show fees incurred as a result of\n\nintransigence versus those incurred for other reasons. Crosetto, 82 Wn. App. at 565.\n\n       Mr. Flores was intransigent during the proceedings. He failed to place all the\n\nmoney he took from the joint savings account into the blocked account. He failed to\n\ntimely and accurately account for the miSSing money. Documents produced pretrial and\n\nwith ER 904s showed conflicting information necessitating a second business valuation\n\nfor JR's. He failed to pay medical expenses for his children, as ordered by the court.\n\nHe stopped paying bills on the house, including the mortgage, necessitating court\n\naction. Thus, regardless of Mr. Flores' ability to pay, his intransigent behavior\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nthroughout the proceedings serves as a basis for awarding attorney fees and costs to\n\nMs. Flores.\n\n                           F. Appe\"ate Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Ms. Flores contends Mr. Flores' appeal is frivolous and requests appellate\n\nattorney fees and costs under RAP 18.1 (a), which authorizes such an award if provided\n\nby applicable law. She requests discretionary attorney fees and costs under RCW\n\n26.09.140, based on her need and his ability to pay. We consider \"the arguable merit of\n\nthe issues on appeal and the financial resources of the respective parties.\" In re\n\nMarriage of Booth, 114 Wn.2d 772, 779, 791 P.2d 519 (1990). \"An appeal is frivolous if\n\nthere are no debatable issues upon which reasonable minds might differ and if it is so\n\ntotally devoid of merit that there is no reasonable possibility of reversal.\" In re Marriage\n\nof Schnurman, 178 Wn. App. 634, 644,316 P.3d 514 (2013). Any doubt about whether\n\nan appeal is frivolous is resolved in the appellant's favor. Id. \"An appeal that is affirmed\n\nsimply because the arguments are rejected is not frivolous.\" Id.\n\n       While some of Mr. Flores' contentions on appeal lack arguable merit, others do\n\nnot. Reasonable minds could differ in valuing JR's and computing Mr. Flores' income.\n\nFurthermore, given Mr. Flores is paying Ms. Flores' attorney fees and costs from the\n\nsuperior court proceeding and the $96,000 in cash she received from the property\n\ndivision, Ms. Flores has the ability to pay the fees incurred in this appeal. Accordingly.\n\nwe deny Ms. Flores' request for an award of fees.\n\n      Affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n      A majority of the panel has determined this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but it will be filed for public record pursuant to RCW\n\n2.06.040.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  Brown, J.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n  ~~,\nSiddoway, C.J.\n                           C-J::-                  :!l\n                                                  Fearing,~'\n                                                             s-\n\n\n\n\n                                           16 \n\n\f",

We conclude the trial court did not abuse its\n\nbroad discretion or fail to apply the relevant legal factors and affirm.\n\fNo. 31951·2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n                                         FACTS\n\n       Julio Flores and Florentina Flores married in April 1993 and separated in\n\nSeptember 2010. The couple have four daughters ages 18,17,14, and 13. Mr. Flores\n\nowns JR's Heating and Air Services (JR's). Mainly, the parties disputed the business\n\nvaluation and the extent of Mr. Flores' income. Ms. Flores works at Prosser School\n\nDistrict and harvests cherries during the summer. Generally, the court received\n\nextensive evidence on all issues, decided the disputed factual issues within the range of\n\npresented evidence, and correctly applied disputed legal factors.\n\n      First, regarding the business valuation, in 1996, Mr. and Ms. Flores started JR's\n\nas a sole proprietorship. JR's pre-tax income showed: $30,000 in 2006; $12,622 in\n\n2007; -$5,510 in 2008; $3,505 in 2009; and -$2,433 in 2010. Retained earnings for JR's\n\nshowed: $90,613 in 2009; $121,286 in 2010; and $96,828 in 2011. In 2011, Mr. Flores\n\nstarted using QuickBooks to record his income and expenses. In preparing Mr. Flores'\n\n2011 tax returns, income errors were discovered neceSSitating an amended return.\n\nCertified Public Accountant (CPA) Joseph Reid, with business valuation accreditation,\n\nprepared business valuation reports for ,.IR's and was Ms. Flores' witness.\n\n      Initially, in a first report, Mr. Reid used the tax returns from 2006-2011, bank\n\nstatements, invoices, and an on-site meeting with Mr. Flores. Using multiple valuation\n\napproaches including the market approach, the asset approach, the capitalization\n\napproach, and the discounting cash flow approach, Mr. Reid concluded JR's value at\n\n$65,000. Later in a second report, Mr. Reid discovered discrepancies in the\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nQuickBooks files obtained from Mr. Flores and recalculated •.IR's value and Mr. Flores'\n\nincome. Using Mr. Flores' mark-up of 65 percent for goods sold and an hourly labor\n\nrate of $85, he calculated JR's gross revenue for 2011 at $228,099. He compared this\n\nvalue to $222,348, the gross revenue calculated using the national average mark-up for\n\nheating and air companies as determined by the Risk Management Association.\n\nAveraging the two, Mr. Reid determined JR's gross revenue for 2011 was $225,224.\n\nHe calculated 2011 net profits at $18,000 after explaining his calculations, then valued\n\nthe business at $100,000. He estimated Mr. Flores' annual salary as $60,000,\n\nexplaining his calculations. The $18,000 net profit was consistent with the profit\n\nanticipated for the amended 2011 tax return. JR's pre-tax income in 2012 was\n\nanticipated to be $47,000.\n\n      The court determined JR's value to be $82,500, the median value between the\n\ninitial valuation and the second valuation, and awarded the asset to Mr. Flores. The\n\ncourt denied Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration, which included his amended 2011\n\ntax return and 2012 tax return.\n\n      Second, regarding Mr. Flores' income, in his second report, Mr. Reid added the\n\nestimated salary ($60,000) and net profit ($18,000) to determine Mr. Flores' annual\n\nincome at $78,000. Brian Newhouse, Mr. Flores' accountant, testified he could not\n\naccurately determine Mr. Flores' income based on the existing documentation. But in a\n\n2007 loan application to refinance his home mortgage, Mr. Flores declared his monthly\n\nincome to be $10,000. And in a 2012 loan application to buy a work van, Mr. Flores\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nindicated his annual income was $100,000. The court accepted Mr. Reid's estimation of\n\nMr. Flores' income at $78,000. The court denied Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration,\n\nwhich included his amended 2011 tax return and 2012 tax return.\n\n       Third, regarding the 2011 Harley Street Glide Motorcycle, Ms. Flores testified she\n\nsaw Mr. Flores driving a 2011 Harley Street Glide and valued the motorcycle at\n\n$20,000. Mr. Flores stated the motorcycle belonged to his brother, however, Mr. Flores\n\nmaintained insurance on it and bought parts for the Street Glide. The court found Mr.\n\nFlores owned the Street Glide, valued it at $20,748, and awarded it to Mr. Flores. The\n\ncourt denied Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration, which included the motorcycle's\n\nregistration and a statement from his brother, Luis Flores, declaring Luis as the owner of\n\nthe Street Glide.\n\n       Fourth, regarding the Yolanda Flores' obligation, Mr. Flores' mother purchased a\n\nmobile home for $12,000 and made improvements. In 1998, Yolanda sold the parties\n\nland and the mobile home in exchange for them repaying a $30,000 loan to Paul Rupp.\n\nYolanda and Mr. Flores testified Mr. Flores also agreed to pay an additional $33,500 to\n\nYolanda. Ms. Flores was unaware of this second obligation. Yolanda later executed\n\nand recorded a deed which indicated the land was a gift. Mr. Flores stated the \"gift\"\n\ndesignation allowed them to avoid paying excise taxes. The obligation to Mr. Rupp was\n\npaid in full by 2003. After separation, Mr. Flores withdrew $130,000 from their joint\n\nsavings account. He gave his mother $34,000. In January 2011, the court ordered Mr.\n\nFlores to put the money into an account and provide an accounting of any money spent.\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nMr. Flores deposited $96,000 and said he used $34,000 for business expenses. Nine\n\nmonths later, Mr. Flores produced a handwritten note from his mother stating her son\n\ngave her $34,000 to pay for the land and the mobile home.

In re Marriage of Stenshoel, 72 Wn. App. 800,806-07,866\n\nP.2d 635 (1993). Mr. Reid, a CPA with accreditation in business valuation, used\n\nseveral legally acceptable methods to value JR's. He reviewed JR's tax returns for the\n\nprevious seven years, bank statements, billable hours, hourly rates, cost of goods sold,\n\nthe reputation of JR's, and past earnings to calculate JR's value in 2011. Mr. Reid's net\n\nprofit calculation was slightly lower than the actual profit seen in the amended 2011 tax\n\nreturn. As Mr. Reid's two valuation reports were admitted into evidence, the court\n\nchose a value in the middle of the two valuations. The court's finding regarding ..IR's\n\nvalue was thus supported by substantial evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\n       In calculating JR's profit, Mr. Reid estimated Mr. Flores' annual salary at\n\n$60,000. Given the lack of income records, Mr. Reid reasonably estimated income by\n\ntaking into account the need to retain a profit for the business. what it would take to hire\n\nsomeone to perform Mr. Flores' job, and certain risk factors. Mr. Reid added JR's net\n\nprofit to the estimated salary for a final income of $78,000. This amount is below Mr.\n\nFlores' multiple representations that his income was $100,000 or more a year. Notably,\n\nJR's consistently had over $90,000 per year in retained earnings. In the end. the court\n\naccepted Mr. Reid's testimony over Mr. Flores' regarding both the value of JR's and Mr.\n\nFlores' income. The trial court, not the appellate court, decides evidence weight and\n\nwitness credibility.\n\n       Even if we disagreed with the superior court, the question is whether tenable\n\ngrounds and tenable reason existed. The court determined JR's value and Mr. Flores'\n\nincome based on Mr. Reid's calculations. Mr. Reid relied on extensive facts and case\n\nlaw. Mr. Reid has been valuing businesses for a number of years. The court's\n\nvaluation of JR's and income computation were well within the range of evidence.\n\n       Additionally, the superior court acted within its discretion in denying Mr. Flores'\n\nreconsideration motion. A motion for reconsideration may be brought for the reasons in\n\nCR 59(a).1 We do not reverse reconsideration rulings without a manifest abuse of\n\n\n\n       1 Mr. Flores contends the following grounds merit granting his motion for\nreconsideration on all issues: \"[a]ccident or surprise which ordinary prudence could not\n                                                                                               f\nhave guarded against\"; U[n]ewly discovered evidence, material for the party making the\napplication, which he could not with reasonable diligence have discovered and\nproduced at the trial\"; \"[t]hat there is no evidence or reasonable inference from the\n                                                                                               Il\n                                             8\n                                                                                               I\n                                                                                               I\n                                                                                               f\n                                                                                               i\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\ndiscretion.

Newly discovered evidence is not \"evidence presented for the\n\nfirst time in a motion for reconsideration\" unless the party shows he could not have\n\nobtained the evidence earlier. Id.\n\n       In Mr. Flores' motion for reconsideration on JR's value and his income, the sole\n\nnew evidence claimed was his amended 2011 tax return and his 2012 tax return. The\n\namended 2011 tax return merely reinforced Mr. Newhouse's trial testimony regarding\n\nJR's profit. Mr. Newhouse testified about expected profit for 2012. As Mr. Flores'\n\nincome could not be determined from JR's prior tax returns, nothing indicates these new              f\n                                                                                                     t\n                                                                                                     ¥\ntax returns would shed light on the issue.

Disputed Motorcycle\n\n       The issue is whether the superior court erred in determining Mr. Flores owned\n\nthe 2011 Harley Street Glide and in denying Mr. Flores' reconsideration motion.

The superior court gave the documentation of Mr. Flores' insurance policy\n\non the motorcycle and testimony of Ms. Flores more weight than the testimonies of Mr.\n\nFlores and his mother. This is clearly an issue of weighing evidence and credibility of\n\nwitnesses for the trial court. As for Mr. Flores' reconsideration request, he argues he\n\nhad no indication the superior court did not believe his testimony and substantial justice\n\nwas not done. But Mr. Flores did not show Luis was unavailable to testify at trial or\n\ndemonstrate Luis' testimony would be persuasive to the court. Accordingly, we\n\nconclude the superior court did not err in denying the reconsideration motion.\n\n                             C.

Spousal Maintenance\n\n      The issue is whether the superior court abused its discretion in awarding Ms.\n\nFlores spousal maintenance of $1,500 per month for 84 months. Mr. Flores contends\n\nthe superior court failed to correctly apply the statutory factors seen in RCW 26.09.090,\n\nresulting in Ms. Flores' unjust enrichment.

Factors to be considered include: the financial resources of the spouse seeking\n\nmaintenance, including community property apportioned her, and her ability to meet her\n\nneeds independently; the time needed to acquire education to enable that party to find\n\nappropriate employment; the standard of living established during the marriage; the\n\nduration of the marriage; the age, physical and emotional condition, and financial\n\nobligations of the spouse seeking maintenance; and the ability of the other spouse to\n\nmeet his needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance.

The court split the community assets 55/45\n\nbecause of Mr. Flores' ability to earn more income than Ms. Flores. Ms. Flores' income\n\nwill remain steady at approximately $1,350 per month. Ms. Flores was awarded\n\napproximately $250,000 in community property, including $28,700 in her pension plan,\n\n$96,000 in cash, and $18,000 in equity in the house. She had to take over making\n\npayments on the $158,000 mortgage, $20,000 of which was a business loan for JR's.\n\nMs. Flores estimated her household expenses for herself and her four daughters was\n\n$5,600 per month. Ms. Flores has no current plans to pursue education.\n\nComparatively, Mr. Flores' income increased over a three-year period, from a loss of\n\n$3,000 in 2010 to a profit of $49,000 in 2012. He estimated his monthly expenses at\n\n$1,600. The court found Mr. Flores \"ha[d] been able to continually purchase non­\n\nessential items, such as motorcycle parts.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 5.\n\n       Based on the above, the length of the marriage, and ascribing an annual income\n\nof $78,000 to Mr. Flores, the court ordered Mr. Flores to pay $1,500 per month for 84\n\nmonths as maintenance. This maintenance award lasts two years after the youngest\n\ndaughter graduates from high school, so Ms. Flores could return to school if she\n\ndesires. The court ordered Mr. Flores to pay $1,919 per month in child support.\n\nAddition of child support and maintenance results in approximately $3,500 per month, a\n\nlittle more than half of Mr. Flores' gross monthly income. After subtracting Mr. Flores'\n\nmonthly expenses, he is left with a little under $1,500 in discretionary income, which is\n\n\n\n                                            12 \n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nfar more than what Ms. Flores realizes. Thus, after the court's consideration of the\n\nrelevant statutory factors, we cannot say the superior court's discretion in awarding\n\nmaintenance was based on untenable grounds or manifestly unreasonable.\n\n                       E. Superior Court Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       The issue is whether the superior court erred in awarding attorney fees and\n\ninvestigation costs to Ms. Flores. Mr. Flores contends the court failed to consider the\n\nliquid assets it awarded to Ms. Flores in the property division in ascertaining her need\n\nfor attorney fees and costs.\n\n      The trial court's decision to award attorney fees and costs in a dissolution action\n\nis discretionary.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n16-17,106 P.3d 768 (2004) (no error in trial court's refusal to award wife attorney fees\n\nwhere wife could pay fees with money received from selling the house). A spouse is not\n\nprecluded from receiving an award of attorney fees and costs because she also\n\nreceived substantial property or maintenance. In re Marriage of Morrow, 53 Wn. App.\n\n579,590,770 P.2d 197 (1989).\n\n      The court distributed 55 percent of the property to Ms. Flores and found she had\n\na need for an award of attorney fees and costs while Mr. Flores had the ability to pay.\n\nMr. Flores has a higher earning power than Ms. Flores: Ms. Flores' income is one-fourth\n\nof Mr. Flores and, unlike Mr. Flores', is without the capacity to grow. Mr. Flores had\n\n\n\n                                            13 \n\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nbeen able \"to continually purchase non-essential items, such as motorcycle parts,\n\nduring the pendency of the dissolution.\" CP at 46. Even with the maintenance and\n\nchild support, Ms. Flores does not have enough money for her monthly expenses. On\n\nthe other hand, Mr. Flores' net monthly calculated income is $5.158. When subtracting\n\nhis monthly maintenance. child support, and personal expenses, he is left with\n\napproximately $150 per month, or $1,800 per year.\n\n       If one spouse's intransigence caused the spouse seeking the award to incur\n\nadditional legal services, \"the financial resources of the spouse seeking the award are\n\nirrelevant.\" In re Marriage of Greenlee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1423935\"><a href=\"/opinion/1423935/in-the-matter-of-marriage-of-greenlee/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Id. Unless intranSigence was seen throughout the entire\n\nproceedings, fee awards should be segregated to show fees incurred as a result of\n\nintransigence versus those incurred for other reasons. Crosetto, 82 Wn. App. at 565.\n\n       Mr. Flores was intransigent during the proceedings. He failed to place all the\n\nmoney he took from the joint savings account into the blocked account. He failed to\n\ntimely and accurately account for the miSSing money. Documents produced pretrial and\n\nwith ER 904s showed conflicting information necessitating a second business valuation\n\nfor JR's. He failed to pay medical expenses for his children, as ordered by the court.\n\nHe stopped paying bills on the house, including the mortgage, necessitating court\n\naction. Thus, regardless of Mr. Flores' ability to pay, his intransigent behavior\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\fNo. 31951-2-111\nIn re Marriage of Flores\n\n\nthroughout the proceedings serves as a basis for awarding attorney fees and costs to\n\nMs. Flores.\n\n                           F. Appe\"ate Attorney Fees and Costs\n\n       Ms. Flores contends Mr. Flores' appeal is frivolous and requests appellate\n\nattorney fees and costs under RAP 18.1 (a), which authorizes such an award if provided\n\nby applicable law. She requests discretionary attorney fees and costs under RCW\n\n26.09.140, based on her need and his ability to pay.

Id. \"An appeal that is affirmed\n\nsimply because the arguments are rejected is not frivolous.\" Id.\n\n       While some of Mr. Flores' contentions on appeal lack arguable merit, others do\n\nnot. Reasonable minds could differ in valuing JR's and computing Mr. Flores' income.\n\nFurthermore, given Mr. Flores is paying Ms. Flores' attorney fees and costs from the\n\nsuperior court proceeding and the $96,000 in cash she received from the property\n\ndivision, Ms. Flores has the ability to pay the fees incurred in this appeal.
