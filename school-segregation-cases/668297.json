The district judge declared portions of this statute to be unconstitutional.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also involved on this appeal is a challenge by State officials to the constitutionality of three federal statutes prohibiting the expenditure of federal funds on school busing for purposes of desegregation.  For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we conclude that there is no case or controversy on the present appeal requiring adjudication of the constitutionality of the three challenged federal statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 30, 1975, the district court entered a judgment requiring the implementation of a plan for school desegregation, which subsequently was approved by this court in Cunningham v. Grayson, supra, 541 F.2d 538.  On September 15, 1975, plaintiffs in No. 76-2158 filed a declaratory judgment action contending that the allocation of state funds to the Jefferson County Board of Education pursuant to the Kentucky Foundation Program Act, K.R.S. ch. 157A, for transportation purposes should be computed on the basis of transportation of students within the county to the nearest school available to them.  The plaintiffs in that case relied upon &#167; 183 of the Kentucky Constitution, which requires the General Assembly by appropriate legislation to provide for an \"efficient\" system of common schools throughout the state.  The argument was made that \"no one can seriously contend that cross district busing is an efficient method of operating a school system.\"  Senior District Judge James F. Gordon rejected this contention in an opinion published at 410 F.Supp. 234 (W.D.Ky.1976), saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>We need not reach the ultimate definition of what is an \"efficient system of common schools throughout the state.\"  At the very least an efficient system of schools is a system which exists and operates.  To exist the Jefferson County schools must be operated and maintained in a constitutional manner, as prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The transportation of over 22,000 students, as provided for in the desegregation order of July 30, 1975, was and is necessary to dismantle an unconstitutional school system and to create a system compatible with the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Given the state's constitutional duty to provide public education in Kentucky and to fund the public school system that is created, the burden of paying for the additional cost of transporting the students required to be bused under the desegregation order falls on the state, assuming the local school district is unable to meet the financial obligation of providing the required transportation.  See K.R.S. 158.110.  In short, once the citizens of Kentucky made the voluntary commitment to educate the children of this state in public schools neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor those individuals responsible for discharging the duties imposed on them by the state constitution and the Foundation Program Act can abrogate those duties merely because the monetary obligation becomes unexpectedly large or even onerous.In conclusion we hold that the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in computing the transportation funds available to Jefferson County, is to include in his computation under the provisions of K.R.S. Chapter 157A, all transportation costs of Jefferson County in the identical manner in which transportation costs are determined under K.R.S. 157A.090 for all other school districts in the state.  410 F.Supp. at 238.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above-quoted opinion of Judge Gordon was announced on March 19, 1976.  On March 29, 1976, the General Assembly enacted into law House Bill No. 168 which became effective immediately.  A copy of this statute is made an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutionality of this statute was attacked by the Jefferson County Board of Education.  In an opinion announced August 27, 1976, the district court held &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 and PP 1, 2 and 3 of &#167; 3 of the statute to be unconstitutional.  With respect to PP 1 and 2 of &#167; 3 Judge Gordon said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Paragraphs 1 and 2 in essence state that local school boards may provide money from their general funds for the transportation of elementary school students to the nearest school able to accommodate the child in his particular grade.  The obvious effect of these paragraphs is that it allows or authorizes local school boards to refuse to expend funds for the transportation of elementary school students beyond the nearest school able to provide space for the student in the appropriate grade level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The defendant contends these first two paragraphs are not unconstitutional because the legislature has not prohibited school boards from expending their funds in transporting elementary school students beyond the nearest available school which can seat that child in his required class but merely gives the school board that discretion if it wishes to avail itself of that authority.  This argument is unpersuasive when juxtaposed the legal responsibilities of the Jefferson County Board of Education.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 are patently unconstitutional insofar as they give the Jefferson County Board of Education the discretion to refuse to provide transportation for elementary school students beyond the nearest school able to provide a space in the appropriate classroom for the transported student.  This discretion has the effect of annulling our desegregation order of July 30, 1975, which requires the Jefferson County Board of Education to dismantle its previously unconstitutional school system by transporting some 22,000 students to assigned schools within the school district.  Thus, if the Court determined that insofar as Jefferson County was concerned paragraphs 1 and 2 in Section 3 of H.B. 168 were constitutional, we would in effect be allowing the General Assembly of Kentucky to circumvent our desegregation order.  We cannot take such a position.  Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897, 902 (6th Cir. 1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>In conclusion paragraphs 1 and 2 of Section 3 of H.B. 168 are unconstitutional insofar as they are made applicable to the Jefferson County Board of Education because they (1) conflict with this Court's duty to remove all remaining vestiges of state-imposed segregation in the Jefferson County school district, a duty imposed on this Court by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in its order of December 11, 1974.  Newburg Area Council, Inc. v. Board of Education, 510 F.2d 1358 (6th Cir. 1974); See also Newburg Area Council, Inc. v. Gordon, 521 F.2d 578 (6th Cir. 1975); and (2) conflicts with this Court's desegregation order issued July 30, 1975, a plan which was and is necessary to dismantle an unconstitutional school system and to create a system compatible with the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This holding is clearly correct.  North Carolina State Board of Education v. Swann, 402 U.S. 43, 91 S.Ct. 1284, 28 L.Ed.2d 586 (1971); Northcross v. Board of Education, 489 F.2d 15, 18-19 (6th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 416 U.S. 962, 94 S.Ct. 1982, 40 L.Ed.2d 313 (1974); Bradley v. Milliken, 433 F.2d 897 (6th Cir. 1970), and cases therein cited.  We also affirm the holding of the district court that &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 of House Bill 168 are unconstitutional for the reasons stated by the court in its memorandum opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Gordon further held that P 3 of &#167; 3 of the statute is unconstitutional under &#167; 51 of the Kentucky Constitution, by concession of the parties.  He ruled that P 4 of &#167; 3 is constitutional on its face, but added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>If the Department of Education or the Jefferson County Board of Education attempted in the future to frustrate or cripple this court's order of July 30, 1975, by adoption of regulations or rules pursuant to this paragraph, the court could at that time, upon appropriate motion, strike down the offensive rule or regulation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State officials challenge the constitutionality of 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1228 and 1652(a) and Public Law 94-94, 89 Stat. 468, &#167; 315(b), which provide that federal funds may not be spent on busing to achieve desegregation, with certain limited exceptions.  In his opinion in Carroll v. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, supra, 410 F.Supp. 234, 238-40, Judge Gordon ruled that these statutes are valid and constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare asserts that there is no case or controversy on this issue in the present case because, irrespective of the three federal statutes under attack, no other federal statute would allow the spending of federal money on home-to-school busing in the present case.  He points out that under the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA), 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1601-19, there are only twelve \"authorized activities,\" on which ESAA money can be spent.  It is stated that the Jefferson County school busing program could not qualify for federal funds under any of these twelve categories or any other statute.  The Secretary asserts the three challenged federal statutes do not cause any harm to the Jefferson County school system of the Commonwealth of Kentucky because \"wiping them off the books would not free a single cent in federal funding for home-to-school transportation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with this contention.  We therefore do not reach the issue of the constitutionality of the three federal statutes here challenged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decision of the district court holding unconstitutional &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 and PP 1, 2 and 3 of &#167; 3 of House Bill 168 is affirmed.

The district judge declared portions of this statute to be unconstitutional.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also involved on this appeal is a challenge by State officials to the constitutionality of three federal statutes prohibiting the expenditure of federal funds on school busing for purposes of desegregation.  For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we conclude that there is no case or controversy on the present appeal requiring adjudication of the constitutionality of the three challenged federal statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 30, 1975, the district court entered a judgment requiring the implementation of a plan for school desegregation, which subsequently was approved by this court in Cunningham v. Grayson, supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338981\"><a href=\"/opinion/338981/cynthia-cunningham-and-richard-n-morgan-v-ernest-grayson-and-jefferson/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></a></span>.  On September 15, 1975, plaintiffs in No. 76-2158 filed a declaratory judgment action contending that the allocation of state funds to the Jefferson County Board of Education pursuant to the Kentucky Foundation Program Act, K.R.S. ch. 157A, for transportation purposes should be computed on the basis of transportation of students within the county to the nearest school available to them.  The plaintiffs in that case relied upon &#167; 183 of the Kentucky Constitution, which requires the General Assembly by appropriate legislation to provide for an \"efficient\" system of common schools throughout the state.  The argument was made that \"no one can seriously contend that cross district busing is an efficient method of operating a school system.\"  Senior District Judge James F. Gordon rejected this contention in an opinion published at <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2308602\"><a href=\"/opinion/2308602/carroll-v-department-of-health-education-and-welfare/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span> (W.D.Ky.1976), saying:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>We need not reach the ultimate definition of what is an \"efficient system of common schools throughout the state.\"  At the very least an efficient system of schools is a system which exists and operates.  To exist the Jefferson County schools must be operated and maintained in a constitutional manner, as prescribed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.  The transportation of over 22,000 students, as provided for in the desegregation order of July 30, 1975, was and is necessary to dismantle an unconstitutional school system and to create a system compatible with the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Given the state's constitutional duty to provide public education in Kentucky and to fund the public school system that is created, the burden of paying for the additional cost of transporting the students required to be bused under the desegregation order falls on the state, assuming the local school district is unable to meet the financial obligation of providing the required transportation.  See K.R.S. 158.110.  In short, once the citizens of Kentucky made the voluntary commitment to educate the children of this state in public schools neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor those individuals responsible for discharging the duties imposed on them by the state constitution and the Foundation Program Act can abrogate those duties merely because the monetary obligation becomes unexpectedly large or even onerous.In conclusion we hold that the Superintendent of Public Instruction, in computing the transportation funds available to Jefferson County, is to include in his computation under the provisions of K.R.S. Chapter 157A, all transportation costs of Jefferson County in the identical manner in which transportation costs are determined under K.R.S. 157A.090 for all other school districts in the state.  410 F.Supp. at 238.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above-quoted opinion of Judge Gordon was announced on March 19, 1976.  On March 29, 1976, the General Assembly enacted into law House Bill No. 168 which became effective immediately.  A copy of this statute is made an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutionality of this statute was attacked by the Jefferson County Board of Education.  In an opinion announced August 27, 1976, the district court held &#167;&#167; 1 and 2 and PP 1, 2 and 3 of &#167; 3 of the statute to be unconstitutional.  With respect to PP 1 and 2 of &#167; 3 Judge Gordon said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>Paragraphs 1 and 2 in essence state that local school boards may provide money from their general funds for the transportation of elementary school students to the nearest school able to accommodate the child in his particular grade.  The obvious effect of these paragraphs is that it allows or authorizes local school boards to refuse to expend funds for the transportation of elementary school students beyond the nearest school able to provide space for the student in the appropriate grade level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The defendant contends these first two paragraphs are not unconstitutional because the legislature has not prohibited school boards from expending their funds in transporting elementary school students beyond the nearest available school which can seat that child in his required class but merely gives the school board that discretion if it wishes to avail itself of that authority.  This argument is unpersuasive when juxtaposed the legal responsibilities of the Jefferson County Board of Education.  Paragraphs 1 and 2 are patently unconstitutional insofar as they give the Jefferson County Board of Education the discretion to refuse to provide transportation for elementary school students beyond the nearest school able to provide a space in the appropriate classroom for the transported student.  This discretion has the effect of annulling our desegregation order of July 30, 1975, which requires the Jefferson County Board of Education to dismantle its previously unconstitutional school system by transporting some 22,000 students to assigned schools within the school district.  Thus, if the Court determined that insofar as Jefferson County was concerned paragraphs 1 and 2 in Section 3 of H.B. 168 were constitutional, we would in effect be allowing the General Assembly of Kentucky to circumvent our desegregation order.  We cannot take such a position.  Bradley v.

He points out that under the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA), 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1601-19, there are only twelve \"authorized activities,\" on which ESAA money can be spent.  It is stated that the Jefferson County school busing program could not qualify for federal funds under any of these twelve categories or any other statute.  The Secretary asserts the three challenged federal statutes do not cause any harm to the Jefferson County school system of the Commonwealth of Kentucky because \"wiping them off the books would not free a single cent in federal funding for home-to-school transportation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with this contention.
