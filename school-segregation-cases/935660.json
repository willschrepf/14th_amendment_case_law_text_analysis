On direct\n\nappeal of that sentence, in State v. Berget (Berget I), this Court determined that the\n\ncircuit court may have improperly considered, for sentencing purposes, statements\n\nmade by Berget in a psychological evaluation procured to determine his competency\n\nto stand trial. 2013 S.D. 1, ¶¶ 92, 119, 826 N.W.2d 1, 28, 37. We remanded\n\nBerget’s death sentence for the limited purpose of resentencing “without the use of\n\nor consideration of” the psychological evaluation unless Berget opted to call its\n\nauthor to testify, and otherwise “on the existing record.” Id. ¶¶ 118, 120, 826\n\nN.W.2d at 37. Berget now appeals the circuit court’s amended judgment of\n\nconviction sentencing him to death. We affirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n[¶2.]        The details of Berget’s crime and the procedural posture of his first\n\nappeal are set out in Berget I, 2013 S.D. 1, ¶¶ 2-10, 826 N.W.2d at 8-10. This\n\nappeal concerns the limited remand instructed in Berget I and proceedings\n\nsubsequent thereto. The relevant facts are provided below.\n\n[¶3.]        In Berget I, this Court affirmed Berget’s death sentence on eleven of\n\ntwelve issues. See id. ¶ 121, 826 N.W.2d at 37. The twelfth issue regarded the\n\ncircuit court’s potentially improper consideration of aggravating evidence in\n\nrendering Berget’s death sentence. Id. ¶¶ 91-118, 826 N.W.2d at 28-37.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -1-\n\f#26764\n\nSpecifically, we noted that after the sentencing hearing, 1 when the circuit court\n\nannounced its sentence, the court indicated that it had considered Berget’s early\n\nacceptance of responsibility for the murder of Ronald Johnson as mitigation. Id. ¶\n\n92, 826 N.W.2d at 28. However, the circuit court then cited an admission Berget\n\ngave during a psychiatric evaluation, which was contained in a report to determine\n\nBerget’s fitness to stand trial. The evaluation had previously been sealed and was\n\nnot admitted as evidence in the sentencing hearing. Id. It contained Berget’s\n\nadmission to the psychiatrist, Dr. David Bean, that he pleaded guilty to Johnson’s\n\nmurder because he “wish[ed] it would be over.” Id. The circuit court stated that\n\nthis admission did not reflect the intentionality that made early acceptance a\n\nmitigating factor. Id. On appeal, we agreed with Berget that the circuit court\n\nmight have committed prejudicial error by improperly considering this admission as\n\naggravating evidence. Id. ¶¶ 116-118, 826 N.W.2d at 36-37.\n\n[¶4.]         To address this error, this Court concluded its opinion with\n\ninstructions: “Pursuant to SDCL 23A-27A-13(2), we remand to the circuit court for\n\nthe purpose of conducting a sentencing without this error. Per this statute, it is to\n\nbe conducted on the existing record without reference to, or considering of, the\n\nreport of Dr. Bean.” 2 Id. ¶ 120, 826 N.W.2d at 37.\n\n\n\n1.      The sentencing court took the matter under advisement and pronounced its\n        initial sentence four days after the completion of the initial sentencing\n        hearing. There is no dispute Berget had an unrestricted opportunity to\n        present all mitigation evidence he desired the court to consider at the\n        sentencing hearing.\n\n2.      We also instructed that Berget could “opt[ ] to call Dr. Bean to testify.” Id. ¶\n        118, 826 N.W.2d at 37. This was the only new evidence—in addition to the\n                                                              (continued . . .)\n                                          -2-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶5.]        On the day after this Court handed down its opinion and judgment, the\n\nState filed a motion for a hearing consistent with the opinion of this Court. The\n\nState acknowledged in its motion that it would not object to Berget introducing the\n\npsychiatric report “with such supplemental direct and cross-examination testimony\n\nof the psychiatrist as Berget might choose to place on the record.” Berget filed a\n\npetition for rehearing on the appeal, which we subsequently denied by order entered\n\nJanuary 22, 2013.\n\n[¶6.]        A month after we handed down our opinion and judgment, Berget sent\n\na letter to the circuit court, pursuant to SDCL 15-12-21.1, requesting that it\n\ndisqualify itself from the remanded proceeding on grounds of judicial bias. In his\n\naffidavit supporting recusal, Berget claimed three instances of bias: (1) the circuit\n\ncourt had to find against Berget’s assertions of fact at sentencing or it would risk\n\ncontradicting its findings of fact and jeopardizing the death sentence in the case of\n\nBerget’s co-defendant, Eric Robert, (2) the Supreme Court had found that the circuit\n\ncourt committed error in its presentence hearing verdict, and (3) the circuit court\n\nhad rendered its sentencing decision “through legal analysis only.” The circuit court\n\ndenied Berget’s request for recusal on February 22, 2013. The Presiding Circuit\n\nJudge of the Second Judicial Circuit entered an order on March 8, 2013, denying\n\nBerget’s formal recusal request. The Presiding Judge based the order on Berget’s\n\nwaiver of his right to disqualify the circuit court, pursuant to SDCL 15-12-24, by\n\n(. . . continued)\n         record at the time of sentencing and the arguments of counsel thereon—that\n         the circuit court could have considered for sentencing purposes on remand.\n         The transcript of the remand motions hearing indicates the circuit court\n         repeatedly inquired whether Berget wanted to exercise the option of calling\n         Dr. Bean to testify. Berget responded in the negative each time.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f#26764\n\nhim having already “submitted multiple arguments and proofs in support of\n\nmotions” to the court prior to his request for recusal.\n\n[¶7.]        Berget also filed a demand for a new sentencing hearing to introduce\n\nnew evidence. That evidence, allegedly obtainable only after his original\n\nsentencing, showed that “Berget has established a meaningful relationship with his\n\nson, his daughter-in-law, and his two grandchildren,” and that the relationship “has\n\nmade a positive impact on the lives of [Berget’s] family, even while [Berget is] in\n\nprison for the rest of his life.” Berget argued, in spite of this Court’s clear directions\n\non remand, that the circuit court “ha[d] the inherent power to grant a new\n\n[sentencing] hearing” and that his federal constitutional rights required it do so.\n\n[¶8.]        The circuit court held a motions hearing on Berget’s demand for a\n\nhearing on April 16, 2013. Berget repeatedly declined the circuit court’s offer to\n\nhave Dr. Bean testify. He reasserted his federal constitutional law arguments and\n\ncontention that the circuit court had the authority to grant a new sentencing\n\nhearing in the face of contrary remand directions by this Court. Berget further\n\nargued that our remand instructions were improper because we could not rely on\n\nSDCL 23A-27A-13(2) to justify our limited remand for resentencing and that our\n\ndirections on remand were otherwise unclear. Finally, Berget reinforced his\n\nargument that his father-son relationship evidence was new and had not been\n\nwithheld for dilatory reasons. The circuit court rejected Berget’s arguments by\n\nnoting that our instructions on remand were clear, that as a circuit court it was\n\nbound to limit its jurisdiction on remand to those instructions, and that a new\n\nsentencing hearing would violate our directive. The circuit court declined to make a\n\nruling on Berget’s constitutional arguments because it determined that they were\n                                        -4-\n\f#26764\n\noutside its limited remand jurisdiction. After considering Berget’s offer of proof—\n\nand without further evidence to consider beyond the evidence, argument and\n\nallocution it considered in Berget’s original sentencing—the circuit court\n\ndetermined that another sentence hearing would serve no purpose given our\n\nremand instructions, and it orally denied Berget’s demand for a new sentencing\n\nhearing.\n\n[¶9.]         The circuit court entered a written order on May 7, 2013, denying\n\nBerget’s motions for a sentencing hearing, to introduce new mitigation evidence,\n\nand to disqualify itself. That same day, the court entered its amended presentence\n\nhearing verdict. Thereafter, both the State and Berget submitted proposed findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law. After considering the proposed amended findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law from Berget and the State, and the objections thereto,\n\nthe circuit court notified the parties that it would adopt the State’s amended\n\nfindings and conclusions in the court’s e-mail of June 7, 2013. The court’s amended\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law were entered that day. The court entered an\n\namended judgment of conviction and sentence, and the death warrant, on June 24,\n\n2013. Berget timely appealed. This Court entered an order for stay of execution on\n\nAugust 7, 2013. 3\n\n\n\n3.      Because of the limited scope of remand and the clarity of the issues presented\n        by both parties, the Court originally anticipated considering this appeal on\n        the written arguments of counsel and without oral argument during its April\n        2014 Term. That determination is normally at the discretion of the Court.\n        See SDCL 15-26A-82. However, we received notice that the Legislature\n        placed an additional procedural requirement on the Court in cases where a\n        circuit court imposes capital punishment: “Both the defendant and the state\n        shall have the right . . . to present oral argument to the court.” SDCL 23A-\n                                                               (continued . . .)\n                                              -5-\n\f#26764\n\n                                        Analysis\n\n[¶10.]          Berget now raises three issues in appealing his resentence on remand.\n\nBerget’s first and second arguments derive from the circuit court’s denial of Berget’s\n\ndemand for a new sentencing hearing. He argues the court erred (1) by failing to\n\nconsider his newly discovered mitigation evidence in reimposing his death sentence\n\nand (2) by preventing him from being present and being able to allocute when it\n\nreimposed its sentence. Berget’s third argument is that the circuit court erred by\n\nrefusing to recuse itself from resentencing. In addition to Berget’s issues, SDCL\n\n23A-27A-12 requires that this Court make three determinations whenever a circuit\n\ncourt imposes the death penalty, specifically:\n\n                (1)   Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the\n                      influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\n                      factor; and\n                (2)   Whether the evidence supports the jury’s or judge’s\n                      finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as\n                      enumerated in § 23A-27A-1; and\n                (3)   Whether the sentence of death is excessive or\n                      disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\n                      considering both the crime and the defendant.\n\nId.   4\n\n\n[¶11.]          1.    Whether the circuit court was required to consider\n                      Berget’s new mitigation evidence in its judgment upon\n                      limited remand.\n\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         27A-11. Because Berget exercised that right, we heard oral argument in this\n         matter during the May 2014 Term.\n\n4.        Although these issues were addressed in the prior direct appeal, and SDCL\n          23A-27A-12 is silent as to whether they must be addressed on appeal of a\n          limited resentencing, we nevertheless address these questions after\n          analyzing the errors Berget advances on this appeal.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶12.]       As noted above, Berget made an offer of proof at the remand motions\n\nhearing regarding the nature and scope of the alleged newly discovered mitigation\n\nevidence of Berget’s positive relationship with his son and his son’s family. Berget\n\nfaults the circuit court’s exclusion of this evidence from its sentencing deliberation\n\nby advancing two theories. First, Berget challenges both the “clarity” of this Court’s\n\ninstructions for a limited remand for resentencing in Berget I, 2013 S.D. 1, ¶¶ 118,\n\n120, 826 N.W.2d at 37, and the statutory authority that we relied on, in part, to so\n\nlimit the scope of the limited resentencing, id. ¶ 120 (citing SDCL 23A-27A-13(2)).\n\nSecond, Berget asserts that even if there was statutory authority to support limiting\n\nthe scope of remand, that limitation on the admission of his new mitigation\n\nevidence violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n[¶13.]       Upon review, “‘[a] [circuit] court’s evidentiary rulings are presumed\n\ncorrect and will not be reversed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion.’” Wilcox\n\nv. Vermeulen, 2010 S.D. 29, ¶ 7, 781 N.W.2d 464, 467 (quoting Thompson v.\n\nMehlhaff, 2005 S.D. 69, ¶ 21, 698 N.W.2d 512, 519-20). An abuse of discretion\n\noccurs when the circuit court exercises its discretion “‘to an end or purpose not\n\njustified by, and clearly against reason and evidence.’” St. John v. Peterson, 2011\n\nS.D. 58, ¶ 10, 804 N.W.2d 71, 74 (quoting Mousseau v. Schwartz, 2008 S.D. 86, ¶ 10,\n\n756 N.W.2d 345, 350). This Court, in turn, will not overturn the circuit court’s\n\nabuse of discretion unless that “error is ‘demonstrated . . . [and] shown to be\n\nprejudicial error.’” State v. Smith, 1999 S.D. 83, ¶ 39, 599 N.W.2d 344, 353\n\n(alteration in original) (quoting State v. Spiry, 1996 S.D. 14, ¶ 11, 543 N.W.2d 260,\n\n263). We, however, review de novo the circuit court’s application of the law\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f#26764\n\nunderlying the circuit court’s exercise of discretion. See State v. Rolfe, 2013 S.D. 2,\n\n¶ 15, 825 N.W.2d 901, 905.\n\n[¶14.]              a.   This Court’s authority to direct a limited\n                         resentencing upon remand.\n\n[¶15.]       Berget argues this Court’s remand instructions “somewhat perplexed”\n\nthe circuit court. Berget attests that this “confusion is understandable” because the\n\nstatute cited by the Court, SDCL 23A-27A-13(2), as additional authority for its\n\nlimited resentencing instruction, was not proper authority on that point. Instead,\n\nnoting the language of the statute, Berget believes this provision only authorizes a\n\nlimited resentencing when the Court remands a death sentence for proportionality\n\nissues. Because this Court in Berget I affirmed each of the proportionality issues\n\ntherein argued by Berget, 2013 S.D. 1, ¶¶ 18-31, 826 N.W.2d at 11-14, he contends\n\nthat our limited remand and the subsequent limited resentencing violated state\n\nlaw.\n\n[¶16.]       First, regarding Berget’s assertion of “confusion”—nowhere in the\n\ntranscript of the motions hearing or elsewhere on the record did the circuit court\n\nexpress confusion with this Court’s instructions. As the hearing transcript\n\nindicates, the court restated our directions, noted their clarity, and in the face of\n\nBerget’s constitutional assertions, adhered to them. Only Berget’s oral argument\n\nasserted any “confusion,” and did so as the basis of argument.\n\n[¶17.]       Whether or not this Court misconstrued SDCL 23A-27A-13 in citing it\n\nas additional authority for its limited remand instructions is immaterial. This\n\nCourt has general statutory and constitutional authority to mandate the scope of\n\nreview on limited remand. As we recently noted in State v. Piper (Piper III), 2014\n\n                                           -8-\n\f#26764\n\nS.D. 2, ¶ 9, 842 N.W.2d 338, 342, both SDCL 15-30-14 and 15-30-11 require the\n\nlower court to enforce our explicit instructions on remand. “‘When the scope of\n\nremand is limited, the entire case is not reopened, but rather, the lower tribunal is\n\nonly authorized to carry out the appellate court’s mandate.’” Piper III, 2014 S.D. 2,\n\n¶ 11, 842 N.W.2d at 343 (quoting In re Conditional Use Permit Granted to Van\n\nZanten, 1999 S.D. 79, ¶ 13, 598 N.W.2d 861, 864).\n\n[¶18.]       Article V of the South Dakota Constitution requires this deference and\n\nclear adherence to this Court’s remand instruction to constitutionally function.\n\nOtherwise, each circuit court would become a supreme court unto itself. See Piper\n\nIII, 2014 S.D. 2, ¶ 10, 842 N.W.2d at 343 (“If the circuit court’s original jurisdiction\n\ncould spontaneously resurrect on remittal, the defined roles of our tiered judicial\n\nsystem . . . and the judicial certainty and efficiency they foster would be nullified.”).\n\n[¶19.]       Given this binding authority, we conclude this Court had the ability\n\npursuant to state constitutional and statutory law to direct a limited resentencing\n\nin Berget I and the circuit court was to follow, and did follow, our directions in\n\naccordance with that authority.\n\n[¶20.]              b.    The federal constitutionality of the limited\n                          resentencing.\n\n[¶21.]       Berget contends the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments nevertheless\n\noverride the Court’s authority to limit resentencing to exclude newly discovered\n\nmitigation evidence. Because the Court’s authority to instruct a limited\n\nresentencing in Berget I was derived from Article V of our state constitution and\n\nfrom statute, Berget’s federal constitutional arguments are in essence challenges to\n\nthe constitutionality of these provisions as applied. His burden is thus:\n\n                                           -9-\n\f#26764\n\n             There is a strong presumption that the laws enacted by the\n             legislature are constitutional and the presumption is rebutted\n             only when it clearly, palpably and plainly appears that the\n             statute violates a provision of the constitution. Further, the\n             party challenging the constitutionality of a statute bears the\n             burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute\n             violates a state or federal constitutional provision.\n\nVilhauer v. Horsemens’ Sports, Inc., 1999 S.D. 93, ¶ 16, 598 N.W.2d 525, 528\n\n(quoting Green v. Siegel, Barnett & Schutz, 1996 S.D. 146, ¶ 7, 557 N.W.2d 396,\n\n398). “‘A defendant cannot claim that a statute is unconstitutional in some of its\n\nreaches if it is constitutional as applied to him.’” State v. Jensen, 2003 S.D. 55, ¶ 13,\n\n662 N.W.2d 643, 648 (quoting City of Pierre v. Russell, 89 S.D. 70, 74, 228 N.W.2d\n\n338, 341 (1975)). Berget, therefore, must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe narrow scope of our limited remand violated the United States Constitution.\n\nWe review this constitutional contention de novo. See Green, 1996 S.D. 146, ¶ 7,\n\n557 N.W.2d at 398 (citing Kyllo v. Panzer, 535 N.W.2d 896, 897 (S.D. 1995)).\n\n[¶22.]       A proper analysis of Berget’s assertion of error requires a summary of\n\nSupreme Court case law on the evolution of capital sentencing rights. The roots of\n\ncapital “mitigation evidence” are found in the Supreme Court case that\n\nreestablished the death penalty as viable under the Eighth Amendment, Gregg v.\n\nGeorgia, 428 U.S. 153, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859 (1976). The Court in Gregg\n\nclarified that the prior case, which effectively abolished the death penalty\n\nnationwide, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346\n\n(1972), did not hold that the death penalty was a per se violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment. 428 U.S. at 188, 96 S. Ct. at 2932. Instead, “Furman held that [the\n\ndeath penalty] could not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a\n\nsubstantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.”\n                                          -10-\n\f#26764\n\nId. To prevent this, the Court began by applying the common precept of sentencing\n\nthat in mitigation or aggravation, “‘justice generally requires . . . that there be\n\ntaken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and\n\npropensities of the offender.’” Id. at 189, 96 S. Ct. at 2932 (quoting Pennsylvania ex\n\nrel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302 U.S. 51, 55, 58 S. Ct. 59, 61, 82 L. Ed. 43 (1937)). The\n\nCourt then acknowledged that much of this evidence, although relevant for\n\nsentencing purposes, would be properly excluded as prejudicial or irrelevant on the\n\nquestion of guilt. Id. at 190, 96 S. Ct. at 2933. Because a jury “cannot be expected\n\nto consider certain evidence before it on one issue, but not another,” id. at 190 n.40,\n\n96 S. Ct. at 2933 n.40 (citations omitted), the Court suggested solving the challenge\n\nthrough a bifurcated trial, wherein a determination of guilt occurs first, and then, if\n\nthe defendant is found guilty, a determination of whether a death sentence will\n\nissue, see id. at 190-92, 96 S. Ct. at 2933-34.\n\n[¶23.]       Although Gregg provided a starting point on the definition of\n\nadmissible mitigation evidence, its common sentencing definition was soon\n\nbroadened. Because of the severity of the death penalty, a plurality of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court determined “the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nrequire that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be\n\nprecluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s\n\ncharacter or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant\n\nproffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.” See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S.\n\n586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 2964-65, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978) (second emphasis added)\n\n(footnote omitted). The sentencing authority’s broad consideration of defendant-\n\nspecific characteristics was viewed as a bulwark against the arbitrary and\n                                         -11-\n\f#26764\n\ncapricious use of the death penalty and ensured that “the death penalty would be\n\nimposed in a more consistent and rational manner.” Id. at 601, 98 S. Ct. at 2963\n\n(citation omitted). Such liberality achieved this consistency by providing a\n\n“meaningful basis for distinguishing the . . . cases in which [the death penalty] is\n\nimposed from . . . the many cases in which it is not.” Id. (citing Gregg, 428 U.S. at\n\n188, 96 S. Ct. at 2932). That plurality holding became the majority position in\n\nEddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982). “By\n\nholding that the sentence in capital cases must be permitted to consider any\n\nrelevant mitigating factor, the rule in Lockett recognizes that a consistency\n\nproduced by ignoring individual differences is a false consistency.” Id. at 112, 102\n\nS. Ct. at 875 (adopting the plurality opinion in Lockett). Accordingly, at sentencing,\n\n“virtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital\n\ndefendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances.” See Payne v.\n\nTennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 822, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 2607, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720 (1991).\n\n[¶24.]       The sentencing authority must then consider all of the relevant\n\nmitigating evidence admitted at sentencing. “Just as the State may not by statute\n\npreclude the sentencer from considering any mitigating factor, neither may the\n\nsentencer refuse to consider, as a matter of law, any relevant mitigating evidence.”\n\nEddings, 455 U.S. at 113-14, 102 S. Ct. at 876-77. “The sentencer, and the Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals on review, may determine the weight to be given relevant\n\nmitigating evidence. But they may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence\n\nfrom their consideration.” Id. at 114-15, 102 S. Ct. at 877.\n\n[¶25.]       Berget argues this broad scope of relevant mitigating evidence requires\n\nthat we adopt his position. However, the concern in this case is narrower and\n                                       -12-\n\f#26764\n\nregards a matter outside the bifurcated trial procedure established in Gregg to\n\nwhich the requirements of a broad scope of relevant mitigating evidence and their\n\nmandated consideration by the sentencing authority (Lockett and Eddings)\n\nexplicitly apply. The issue, rather, is whether the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments prohibit this Court from narrowing the circuit court’s jurisdiction,\n\nupon a limited remand for resentencing in a capital case, such that the court could\n\nnot consider relevant evidence for mitigation purposes discoverable only after\n\nremand. 5\n\n[¶26.]         Berget relies on Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 106 S. Ct. 1669,\n\n90 L. Ed. 2d 1, (1986), which held that new, relevant mitigating evidence may be\n\nintroduced at least through a capital defendant’s period of incarceration while\n\nawaiting trial. In that case, Skipper and his former wife testified during the\n\nsentencing phase that he had “conducted himself well during the 7½ months he\n\nspent in jail between his arrest and trial” and had earned his high school diploma.\n\nId. at 3, 106 S. Ct. at 1670. He asserted that this behavior was indicative of his\n\nfuture conduct in custody and that his sentence should therefore have been reduced\n\nto life imprisonment. Id. In further support, Skipper sought to introduce testimony\n\nfrom jailers and a “regular visitor” to the jail that he had “made a good adjustment,”\n\nindicating his future adaptability to prison life. Id. The sentencing court ruled that\n\nsuch evidence was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible, citing state case law that a\n\ndefendant’s ability to adjust to life behind bars could not be relevant to capital\n\n\n5.       The circuit court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law entered after its\n         original sentencing indicate that at that time it was known to Berget and the\n         circuit court that Berget had a son.\n\n                                          -13-\n\f#26764\n\nsentencing. Id. The sentencing jury subsequently sentenced Skipper to death. Id.\n\nOn appeal, Skipper asserted that the sentencing court had committed constitutional\n\nerror, pursuant to Lockett and Eddings, by excluding the relevant, mitigating\n\ntestimony of the jailers and the visitor. Id.\n\n[¶27.]       The Supreme Court agreed with Skipper. While the Court admitted\n\nthat “any such inferences” arising out of the “good adjustment” testimony “would\n\nnot relate specifically to petitioner’s culpability for the crime he committed,” the\n\nCourt found that this testimony nevertheless provided mitigation inferences “in the\n\nsense that [the inferences] might serve ‘as a basis for a sentence less than death.’”\n\nId. at 4-5, 106 S. Ct. at 1671 (quoting Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964).\n\nThe Court implied that this “basis for a sentence less than death” arose out of its\n\nprevious holding that “evidence that a defendant would in the future pose a danger\n\nto the community if he were not executed may be treated as establishing an\n\n‘aggravating factor’ for purposes of capital sentencing.” Id. (citing Jurek v. Texas,\n\n428 U.S. 262, 275, 96 S. Ct. 2950, 2958, 49 L. Ed. 2d 929 (1976) (opinion of Stewart,\n\nPowell, and Stevens, JJ.)). The Court reasoned that if evidence of a future danger\n\ncould always be admissible as aggravating evidence, then evidence indicating the\n\ninverse—that a defendant “would not pose a danger if spared (but incarcerated)”—\n\nwas applicable to death penalty cases generally as a “potentially mitigating” factor.\n\nId. at 5. As such a factor, it “[could] not be excluded from the sentencer’s\n\nconsideration.” Id. The Court concluded, “‘any sentencing authority must predict a\n\nconvicted person’s probable future conduct when it engages in the process of\n\ndetermining what punishment to impose.’” Id. at 5, 106 S. Ct. at 1671 (quoting\n\nJurek, 428 U.S. at 275, 96 S. Ct. at 2958). Because the sentencing court excluded\n                                         -14-\n\f#26764\n\nthe future conduct testimony of the jailers and visitor from the sentencing jury, the\n\nCourt determined the sentencing court had violated Skipper’s Eighth Amendment\n\nright to present all mitigating evidence. See id. at 4, 106 S. Ct. at 1671.\n\n[¶28.]         Evidence of Berget’s newfound relationship with his son and his son’s\n\nfamily conceivably could have been relevant evidence that Berget would not pose a\n\ndanger in prison if spared, particularly under Lockett’s broad instruction that “any\n\naspect of [the] defendant’s character . . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\n\nsentence less than death” can be mitigating information. 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct.\n\nat 2964-65. Taking Skipper and Lockett together, then, Berget’s relationship may\n\nhave been evidence the court could not have excluded from its consideration if\n\nBerget offered it at any point prior to completion of the sentencing portion of the\n\ntrial. See Skipper, 476 U.S. at 5, 106 S. Ct. at 1671.\n\n[¶29.]         Berget’s constitutional argument, however, relies on extending the\n\nwindow for unconstitutional exclusion of new mitigation evidence further, to include\n\nmitigating information discoverable only after the original sentencing and offered\n\nbefore resentencing. 6 To find authority supporting this proposition, Berget relies on\n\nthe Skipper Court’s instructions on remand. See id. at 8, 106 S. Ct. at 1673 (“The\n\nresulting death sentence cannot stand, although the State is of course not precluded\n\nfrom again seeking to impose the death sentence, provided that it does so through a\n\nnew sentencing hearing at which petitioner is permitted to present any and all\n\n6.       Berget does not dispute the State’s assertion, citing State v. Robert, 2012 S.D.\n         60, ¶ 20, 820 N.W.2d 136, 143 (citing Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U.S. 465,\n         479, 127 S. Ct. 1933, 1942, 167 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2007)), that mitigation\n         information reasonably discoverable before sentencing is waived when a\n         capital defendant fails to present the evidence at sentencing.\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f#26764\n\nrelevant mitigating evidence that is available.” (Emphasies added.)). The Court,\n\nhowever, did not clarify whether it meant “all relevant mitigation evidence that is\n\navailable” on the existing record at the original sentencing or on the record that\n\ncould be developed up to resentencing.\n\n[¶30.]         Regardless of the Court’s intent, that instruction is not appropriate\n\nauthority to support Berget’s claim since his case is readily distinguishable. As\n\nwith all authoritative case precedent, the result in Skipper and “those portions of\n\nthe opinion necessary to that result” are binding. See Seminole Tribe of Florida v.\n\nFlorida, 517 U.S. 44, 67, 116 S. Ct. 1114, 1129, 134 L. Ed. 2d 252 (1996). The\n\nSkipper Court’s instruction of a new sentencing hearing was the necessary result of\n\nthe sentencing court’s error in excluding mitigation evidence from a sentencing\n\njury’s consideration, thereby tainting the subsequent sentencing hearing. A new,\n\nfull sentencing hearing was “necessary” because it would be required to probe the\n\nvalue of the wrongly excluded testimony, since its contribution to the sentencing\n\nauthority’s weighing 7 of mitigating and aggravating factors was otherwise\n\nundefined. Consequently, the sentencing authority could have given the wrongly\n\nexcluded mitigating factor such weight that it alone was grounds for a life sentence.\n\n\n7.       Our use of the word “weighing” in this context does not contradict the fact\n         that South Dakota is a non-weighing state. See State v. Rhines (Rhines II),\n         2000 S.D. 19, ¶¶ 52-53, 608 N.W.2d 303, 314. In describing the distinction\n         between weighing and non-weighing states, the Supreme Court has noted,\n         “[t]he terminology is somewhat misleading, since we have held that in all\n         capital cases the sentencer must be allowed to weigh the facts and\n         circumstances that arguably justify a death sentence against the defendant’s\n         mitigating evidence.” Brown v. Sanders, 546 U.S. 212, 216-17, 126 S. Ct. 884,\n         889, 163 L. Ed. 2d 723 (2006) (citing Eddings, 455 U.S. at 110, 102 S. Ct. at\n         874)\n\n\n                                           -16-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶31.]         In Berget’s case, the apparent error was very different. Unlike Lockett,\n\nEddings and Skipper, the circuit court here did not improperly exclude evidence\n\nfrom the sentencing hearing, but only improperly considered evidence (if it did so at\n\nall) after the hearing was completed, during its deliberation. See Berget I, 2013 S.D.\n\n1, ¶ 119, 826 N.W.2d at 37. The sentencing hearing itself was not tainted because\n\nBerget exercised the unrestricted opportunity to introduce all mitigating evidence\n\nhe desired. 8 Furthermore, once the Dr. Bean report was excluded, the remaining\n\n\n8.       Berget asserts that because the court received Dr. Bean’s report before the\n         sentencing hearing, its mere existence in the record in that phase of the\n         proceeding—albeit sealed throughout the hearing—was sufficient to taint the\n         entire sentencing phase. Objectively, however, there was no indication in the\n         hearing transcript or elsewhere that the court improperly considered Berget’s\n         admission to Dr. Bean or unsealed the report until its deliberation in drafting\n         its presentence hearing verdict. The report was not offered into evidence or\n         even mentioned at the sentencing hearing. See Berget I, 2013 S.D. 1, ¶ 94,\n         826 N.W.2d at 29. In order for the Court to adopt Berget’s argument, we\n         would need to speculate on the mental processes of the court, which we will\n         not do.\n\n         If the court erred, then, it did so by improper weighing of mitigation evidence.\n         See Berget I, 2013 S.D. 1, ¶ 118, 826 N.W.2d at 37. That error is an order of\n         magnitude lower than if the court had excluded mitigating evidence from its\n         consideration. The constitution clearly prohibits exclusion of relevant,\n         mitigating evidence obtained before sentencing in a capital decision. See\n         Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964-65. The necessary remedy for\n         violating this prohibition is remand to the circuit court for its consideration of\n         all relevant mitigating evidence. See Eddings, 455 U.S. at 117, 102 S. Ct. at\n         878. The same cannot be said for the improper consideration of aggravating\n         evidence. The constitution, in fact, permits an appellate court to reweigh the\n         proper evidence and impose the death penalty in response to an error in the\n         trial court’s weighing of the evidence. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U.S.\n         738, 745, 110 S. Ct. 1441, 1446, 108 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1990); Spaziano v.\n         Florida, 468 U.S. 447, 104 S. Ct. 3154, 82 L. Ed. 2d 340 (1984) (approving a\n         state appellate court’s affirmance of a death conviction by reweighing the\n         aggravating and mitigating evidence after that court’s determination that an\n         aggravating circumstance was improperly submitted to the factfinder). This\n         is particularly true in non-weighing states. See Rhines II, 2000 S.D. 19, ¶ 54,\n         608 N.W.2d at 315 (quoting Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222, 231-32, 112 S.\n                                                               (continued . . .)\n                                              -17-\n\f#26764\n\nevidence and factors in mitigation and aggravation remained unchanged from those\n\nconsidered by the circuit court in the initial sentencing hearing. Therefore, we\n\ndetermined that a limited resentencing on the prior record—that merely struck the\n\noffensive evidence or permitted its elaboration by Berget through Dr. Bean—would\n\nbe sufficient to correct this error on remand. 9 In directing a limited remand, we\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         Ct. 1130, 1137, 117 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1992)) (“When the weighing process itself\n         has been skewed, . . . harmless-error analysis or reweighing at the trial or\n         appellate level suffices to guarantee that the defendant received an\n         individualized sentence.”). That authority is further described by the\n         Supreme Court:\n\n             If a person sentenced to death in fact killed, attempted to kill, or\n             intended to kill, the Eighth Amendment itself is not violated by\n             his or her execution regardless of who makes the determination\n             of the requisite culpability; by the same token, if a person\n             sentenced to death lacks the requisite culpability; the Eighth\n             Amendment violation can be adequately remedied by any court\n             that has the power to find the facts and vacate the sentence.\n\n      Cabana v. Bullock, 474 U.S. 376, 386, 106 S. Ct. 689, 697, 88 L. Ed. 2d 704\n      (1986), abrogated on other grounds by Pope v. Illinois, 481 U.S. 497, 107 S.\n      Ct. 1918, 95 L. Ed. 2d 439 (1987).\n\n9.    In the past, this Court has not hesitated to require a full sentencing hearing\n      on remand in a death penalty case when the nature of the error warranted\n      that outcome. For instance, in Piper II, 2009 S.D. 66, ¶ 21, 771 N.W.2d at\n      360, we vacated Piper’s death sentence and remanded the matter “for a new\n      sentencing proceeding” because Piper had not validly waived his\n      constitutional right to a jury in the sentencing phase. The constitutional\n      error in Piper II occurred before the sentencing hearing, and the nature of the\n      error affected the entire sentencing proceeding. In contrast, the error\n      prompting Berget’s limited resentencing occurred after the sentence hearing,\n      and did not taint the hearing. Again, only the circuit court’s possible\n      consideration of improper aggravating evidence may have needed correction,\n      requiring a limited remand, if any. See Clemons, 494 U.S. at 745, 110 S. Ct.\n      at 1446.\n\n      That potential error, and the limited remand we instructed to address it in\n      Berget I, stands in stark contrast to another case involving a remand for\n                                                           (continued . . .)\n                                         -18-\n\f#26764\n\npresume the circuit courts “know the law and [will] apply it in making [their]\n\ndecisions.” State v.

The limited resentencing consequently reflected our\n\npreference, in this instance, not to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence\n\nwithout the offending concern ourselves, but to have the sentencing authority\n\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         sentencing, State v. Bult (Bult IV), 1996 S.D. 20, 544 N.W.2d 214. Bult IV\n         arose out of our repeated remands to the circuit court, after the court\n         continued to impose life sentences without the possibility of parole and in\n         spite of our repeat conclusions that that sentence constituted cruel and\n         unusual punishment. See State v. Bult (Bult III), 529 N.W.2d 197 (S.D.\n         1995); Bult v. Leapley (Bult II), 507 N.W.2d 325 (S.D. 1993). In Bult IV, we\n         established that “the court had an obligation” on remand from Bult III to\n         update the relevant evidence necessary to fashion a sentence, see Bult IV,\n         1996 S.D. 20, ¶ 12, 544 N.W.2d at 217, which included mitigating evidence.\n         However, Bult IV is clearly distinguishable from the present case. In Bult\n         III, we did not instruct a limited remand as we did in Berget I, but permitted\n         a full sentence hearing on remand because the nature of the error warranted\n         that type of remand. See Bult III, 529 N.W.2d at 200. Our opinion here does\n         not erode Bult IV’’s conclusion that at a full sentencing hearing on remand,\n         the defendant is entitled to the rights available at his or her original\n         sentencing. See 1996 S.D. 20, ¶¶ 8-14, 544 N.W.2d at 216-17. What Bult IV\n         did not do was establish a right to update one’s mitigation evidence on any\n         remand, or when directly contradicted by our remand instructions as Berget\n         seeks here. Bult IV, in fact, stands for the supremacy of our remand\n         authority, which we reassert here.\n\n      Multiple state supreme courts have affirmed similar limited remands of\n      capital sentences. See, e.g., Ex parte Slaton, 680 So. 2d 909, 922-23 (Ala.\n      1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1079 (1997); People v. Lewis, 91 P.3d 928, 937\n      (Cal. 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1178 (2005); Crump v. State, 654 So.2d\n      545, 548 (Fla. 1995) (per curiam).\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\f#26764\n\nefficiently correct the limited error. Because of these substantial differences,\n\nSkipper does not control Berget’s argument. 10\n\n[¶32.]         The Supreme Court has not determined, in Skipper or otherwise, that\n\na capital defendant has a categorical constitutional right to introduce new\n\nmitigation evidence discovered after a sentencing hearing in which the defendant\n\nwas given the opportunity to present all mitigation evidence he desired. It has also\n\nnot determined whether a remand for a limited resentencing in a capital case that\n\neffectively excludes such newly discovered mitigation evidence is constitutionally\n\ninvalid. On both issues, lower courts have attempted to fill that void. Berget and\n\nthe State each rely on different authorities reflecting a split in opinion.\n\n[¶33.]         Berget contends Davis v. Coyle (Davis V), 475 F.3d 761 (6th Cir. 2007),\n\nprovides persuasive authority. On an appeal of a denial of a petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus, Davis sought to challenge his Ohio death sentence. The Ohio\n\nSupreme Court had affirmed Davis’s convictions but vacated his death sentence\n\nbecause, as with Berget I, the sentencing authority (a three-judge panel) may have\n\nconsidered improper aggravating factors in its sentence. Id. at 763. The sentencing\n\ncourt, on remand for “a new sentencing trial” as instructed by the appellate court,\n\nconsidered only the record of the trial and first sentencing proceeding. The court\n\nrefused to consider Davis’s motion to withdraw his jury waiver and to introduce new\n\nmitigation testimony concerning his post-prison behavior and updated psychological\n\nprofile. Id. at 769. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the court’s resentencing,\n\n10.      On a petition for rehearing in response to this Court’s opinion on direct\n         appeal, Berget offered this same argument, citing Skipper, to cast doubt on\n         the propriety of this Court’s limited remand. Thus, we have had two\n         occasions to analyze this argument.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f#26764\n\nfinding that “it is basic law that a reversal and remand to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings has the effect of reinstating the cause in the trial court in status quo\n\nante.” Id. at 770 (quoting State v. Davis (Davis III), No. CA89-09-123, 1990 WL\n\n165137, *2 (Ohio Ct. App. Oct. 29, 1990)). The appeals court further noted that\n\nbecause the error requiring remand “‘occurred at the deliberative state of the\n\nproceedings, after the evidence had been submitted to the court,’” the sentencing\n\ncourt need not consider additional evidence. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed\n\non slightly different grounds, finding that unlike Skipper, Davis had the\n\nopportunity to present all then-available mitigation evidence at his first sentencing\n\ntrial and was therefore not denied the “individual consideration of relevant\n\nmitigating factors” that was the crux of Skipper, Eddings, and Lockett. Id. (quoting\n\nState v. Davis (Davis IV), 584 N.E.2d 1192, 1195 (Ohio 1992)). Moreover, the Court\n\nfound that Skipper only applied to mitigation evidence of a good prison record\n\nbetween a defendant’s arrest and trial, and not to post-trial prison behavior. Id. at\n\n772 (citing Davis IV, 584 N.E.2d at 1195).\n\n[¶34.]       The Sixth Circuit rejected this collected reasoning. The court\n\nprimarily drew comparisons between Davis’s case on resentencing and Skipper at\n\nsentencing—both prosecutors introduced evidence or argument of defendants’\n\ndangerousness behind bars and both defendants faced “future dangerousness” as\n\nthe “central” aggravating factors in their sentences. Compare Skipper, 476 U.S. at\n\n2, 3, 106 S. Ct. at 1670, with Davis V, 475 F.3d at 771-72. The court determined\n\nthat the only way to distinguish the two cases was that Skipper involved sentencing\n\nand Davis’s case involved resentencing. See id. at 773. The court found that to be\n\nan unreasonable basis for denying the application of Skipper to Davis’s case. Id.\n                                       -21-\n\f#26764\n\nThe Davis court also concluded that the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits already\n\nsupported the application of Skipper to resentencing. 11 Accordingly, the court found\n\nthat only a new, full resentencing hearing could permit the proper weighing of the\n\nimproperly excluded new mitigation testimony. Id. at 774-75.\n\n[¶35.]         The State, in contrast, cites the Ohio Supreme Court case of State v.\n\nRoberts, 998 N.E.2d 1100 (Ohio 2013), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 1554\n\n(2014). In Roberts, on direct appeal, the Court affirmed Roberts’s convictions of\n\naggravated murder and both aggravated circumstances therein, but remanded for\n\nlimited resentencing because the trial judge engaged in ex parte communications\n\nwith the prosecutor in drafting the sentencing opinion. Id. at 1104. The Court\n\n\n11.      Only one Ninth Circuit case cited in Davis V actually addresses whether new\n         mitigation evidence, constitutionally speaking, must be admitted at\n         resentencing after the defendant was given the opportunity to present all\n         mitigation evidence at his original sentencing. See 475 F.3d at 782 (Gibbons,\n         Cir. J., concurring) (noting only one case was so “on point”). That case is\n         Creech v. Arave, 947 F.2d 873, 881-82 (9th Cir. 1991), overruled on other\n         grounds, 507 U.S. 463, 113 S. Ct. 1534, 123 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1996). Creech\n         based its finding that Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper “required that a\n         defendant be allowed to offer such mitigating evidence at resentencing” on\n         the Idaho Supreme Court’s ruling in Sivak v. State, 731 P.2d 192, 197 (Idaho\n         1986). The Ninth Circuit justified its ruling by stating, “Like the Idaho\n         Supreme Court, we see no rational basis for distinguishing the evidence of a\n         defendant’s good conduct while awaiting trial and sentencing, and evidence of\n         a defendant’s good conduct pending review of a death sentence which is\n         vacated on appeal.” Creech, 947 F.2d at 881-82 (internal citations omitted).\n         The Idaho Supreme Court’s logic was that if the mitigating relevance of a\n         capital defendant’s prison behavior is to show “his probable future conduct at\n         the penitentiary, and hence, the appropriateness of the death penalty as\n         opposed to a life sentence[,]” then there is no qualitative difference between\n         pre-sentence and post-sentence prison conduct for mitigation purposes.\n         Sivak, 731 P.2d at 197-98. If anything, according to the Idaho Supreme\n         Court, defendant’s behavior in jail awaiting sentencing may be a less reliable\n         indicator of future conduct in the penitentiary than defendant’s actual\n         conduct at the penitentiary post-sentence, making this new post-sentence\n         mitigation evidence more reliable. Id.\n\n                                          -22-\n\f#26764\n\nspecified on remand that Roberts had a right to allocute and that the trial court was\n\nto reweigh the evidence and “personally prepare an entirely new penalty opinion.”\n\nId. On remand, Roberts filed a motion to introduce new mitigation evidence,\n\nincluding prison records, a disability claim file, an affidavit from Roberts’s\n\npsychologist offering a preliminary diagnosis, and a letter about Roberts from her\n\nson. Id. at 1104-05. That motion was denied. Id. at 1105. The trial court heard\n\nRoberts’s allocution and sentenced her to death.\n\n[¶36.]       On appeal, the Court rejected Roberts’s assertion that the sentencing\n\ncourt erred in precluding her from presenting new mitigating evidence on remand.\n\nThe Court distinguished Skipper, Lockett, and Eddings as inapplicable because\n\nthose cases “involved a situation where the capital sentencer was prohibited, in\n\nsome form or another, from considering relevant mitigating evidence at trial. . . .\n\n[N]o relevant mitigating evidence was ever excluded from consideration during\n\n[Roberts’s] penalty phase.’” Id. at 1107 (first two alterations in original) (quoting\n\nState v. Chinn, 709 N.E.2d 1166, 1180-81 (Ohio 1999)). “In other words, neither\n\nLockett nor any of its progeny required the trial court to reopen the evidence after\n\nan error-free evidentiary hearing had already taken place.” Id. at 1108 (citing\n\nChinn, 709 N.E.2d at 1180-81). Instead, the error in question occurred after the\n\nevidentiary sentencing proceeding had closed; therefore, “the trial court was\n\nrequired to proceed on remand from the point at which the error occurred[.]” Id. at\n\n1110 (quoting Chinn, 709 N.E.2d at 1181). Otherwise, the Court would create an\n\nunauthorized “right to update one’s mitigation. Such a right has no clear basis in\n\nLockett or its progeny.” Id. at 1108.\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶37.]       Beyond an inability to reconcile Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper to this\n\nalleged right to update one’s mitigation evidence, the Court rejected Roberts’s\n\nargument as causing untenable results. The Court reasoned that:\n\n             Establishing a right to update mitigation could result in\n             arbitrary distinctions between similarly situated capital\n             defendants. A defendant who had an error-free mitigation\n             hearing could not update his mitigation—no matter how\n             compelling the new mitigation that might be available to him—\n             if the trial judge committed no error after the mitigation hearing\n             that called for the case to be remanded. But another defendant,\n             whose mitigation hearing was equally free of error, would have\n             the right to update his mitigation in the event that a\n             posthearing sentencing error took place that required a remand.\n\nId.\n\n[¶38.]       Both Davis V and Roberts provide reasoning for whether or not\n\nSupreme Court precedent gives indirect authority that a court, on limited\n\nresentencing, must consider new mitigation evidence. Two key factors, however,\n\npoint to Roberts being the persuasive authority.\n\n[¶39.]       First, the Sixth Circuit based its decision in Davis V on the salient\n\naggravating circumstance shared in both Davis and Skipper. “[T]he core of the\n\nanalysis in Skipper reflects the Court’s understanding that the right of a defendant\n\nto present evidence of good behavior in prison is particularly relevant when a\n\nprediction of future dangerousness figures centrally in a prosecutor’s plea for\n\nimposition of the death penalty.” Davis V, 475 F.3d at 771 (emphasis added).\n\n“Although there could conceivably be some question about the relevance of such\n\nevidence in the abstract, the record in this case establishes without doubt that [the\n\nnewly discovered evidence on remand] was highly relevant to the single aggravating\n\nfactor relied upon by the state—that future dangerousness should keep Davis on\n\n                                         -24-\n\f#26764\n\ndeath row.” Id. at 773 (emphasis added). Therefore, according to the court, Skipper\n\nwas substantively distinguishable from Davis’s situation “solely on the basis of\n\ntiming,” and it applied Skipper to require a full resentencing. See id.\n\n[¶40.]       In contrast, the two statutory aggravating circumstances under which\n\nthe court sentenced Berget to death did not relate to his future dangerousness per\n\nse, but to the nature of the murder he committed. See SDCL 23A-27A-1(7), (8)\n\n(“[t]he offense was committed against a[n] . . . employee of a corrections institution,”\n\nand “[t]he offense was committed by a person in . . . the lawful custody of . . . a place\n\nof lawful confinement”). These statutory aggravating circumstances do not include\n\nfuture dangerousness as a consideration. Moreover, the circuit court considered\n\nBerget’s future dangerousness as one among four other non-statutory aggravating\n\ncircumstances. The court’s original and amended presentence hearing verdicts\n\nindicate the court also took into account: (1) the violent nature of Berget’s attack on\n\nJohnson, (2) that a life sentence would have no deterrent effect on other inmates\n\nsimilarly situated to Berget, (3) that Berget had a long criminal history of ever-\n\nincreasing violence outside of prison, and (4) that Berget showed a lack of remorse\n\nto Johnson’s family. Berget’s future dangerousness undoubtedly played a role in\n\nthe court’s penalty analysis, but that aggravating concern did not predominate as it\n\ndid in Davis or Skipper. Since this “central role” is the basis of the Sixth Circuit’s\n\nreasoning in Davis V, Berget’s reliance on that case is questionable.\n\n[¶41.]       Second, and most importantly, however, the negative consequences of\n\nadopting Berget’s position, as noted in Roberts, make Roberts the persuasive\n\nauthority. For instance, as noted above, under SDCL 23A-27A-12(2) we are\n\nstatutorily charged with an independent determination of “whether the evidence\n                                       -25-\n\f#26764\n\nsupports . . . [a] judge’s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as\n\nenumerated in § 23A-27A-1.” Because of this duty, were we to accept Berget’s\n\nrationale that Skipper and Davis V require consideration of newly discovered post-\n\ntrial mitigation evidence in every capital case, this Court would open the door to\n\nbecoming the initial trier of fact for evidence never presented or considered by the\n\ncircuit court. Under Berget’s rationale, this Court, when presented with new post-\n\ntrial evidence upon appeal, “could be considered a ‘sentencer’ for Lockett purposes.”\n\nSee Roberts, 998 N.E.2d at 1108-09. This, again, would thwart the judicial economy\n\nof our tiered judicial system. See Piper III, 2014 S.D. 2, ¶ 10, 842 N.W.2d at 343. It\n\nwould also no longer make the original sentencing proceeding the “main event” but\n\nimproperly relegate it to a mere “tryout on the road.” See Gregory v. Solem, 449\n\nN.W.2d 827, 833 (S.D. 1989) (citing Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90, 97 S. Ct.\n\n2497, 2508, 53 L. Ed. 2d 594, 610 (1977)).\n\n[¶42.]       Additionally, the Roberts Court’s finding of arbitrary discrepancies\n\nthat may manifest between similarly situated capital defendants simply because of\n\na post-sentence error in deliberation is clearly applicable in this case. No\n\nsentencing error existed in the case of Berget’s co-defendant, Eric Robert. See State\n\nv. Robert, 2012 S.D. 60, 820 N.W.2d 136. Had Robert proceeded with his case and\n\ntried to raise a similar argument of post-sentencing discovery of evidence he deemed\n\nto be mitigating, under the rationale now advanced by Berget, Berget could obtain a\n\nsecond sentencing hearing while Robert could not. Therefore, the circumstances of\n\ntheir offenses and the individual “character and propensities” of each defendant—\n\nthe fundamental concerns of sentencing, see Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189, 96 S. Ct. at\n\n2932 (citations omitted)—would not result in their distinct sentencing treatments;\n                                       -26-\n\f#26764\n\nthey would result from a potential, extraneous court error that occurred after\n\nsentencing. That strikes at the heart of Lockett’s holding that the death penalty\n\nshould be imposed “in a more consistent and rational manner[,]” based on an\n\nanalysis of the fundamental concerns of sentencing. See Lockett, 438 U.S. at 601,\n\n605, 98 S. Ct. at 2963, 2965.\n\n[¶43.]       It is that very interest in achieving a “more rational and equitable\n\nadministration of the death penalty” that the Supreme Court found to be the basis\n\nfor allowing states the “authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a\n\ndefendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted[,]”\n\nincluding mitigation evidence, in capital cases. See Oregon v. Guzek, 546 U.S. 517,\n\n526, 126 S. Ct. 1226, 1232, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1112 (2006). A reasonable limit is one that\n\nwe impose today that avoids the arbitrary outcomes and judicial inefficiency noted\n\nin Roberts and reinforces an appellate court’s authority to instruct a limited\n\nremand.\n\n[¶44.]        The Supreme Court’s ruling in Guzek is also instructive in a broader\n\nsense. In Guzek, the issue relevant to this case was whether the Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments granted Guzek the right to introduce new evidence of his\n\ninnocence at his sentencing hearing—namely, that he was not present at the scene\n\nof the crime. Id. at 523, 126 S. Ct. at 1230. The Court rejected the Oregon Supreme\n\nCourt’s broadening of Lockett to provide an Eighth Amendment right for Guzek to\n\nintroduce newly discovered evidence of his innocence at a sentencing hearing. Id. at\n\n523, 126 S. Ct. at 1230-31. The Court grounded its ruling on three conclusions.\n\nFirst, the Court noted that, fundamentally, “evidentiary concerns” are different\n\nbetween guilt and sentencing phases, with the former concern asking whether the\n                                       -27-\n\f#26764\n\ndefendant committed the crime and the latter asking how the act was committed.\n\nId. at 526, 126 S. Ct. at 1232. Second, the Court found that “the parties previously\n\nlitigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant—whether the defendant\n\ncommitted the basic crime. The evidence thereby attacks a previously determined\n\nmatter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue. The law\n\ntypically discourages collateral attacks of this kind.” Id. (citing Allen v. McCurry,\n\n449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S. Ct. 411, 415, 66 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1980)). Third, the Court\n\ndetermined that any “negative impact of a rule restricting defendant’s ability to\n\nintroduce new alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the\n\ndefendant the right to present to the sentencing jury all the evidence of innocence\n\nfrom the original trial regardless.” 12 Id. at 526-27, 126 S. Ct. at 1233 (citing Or.\n\nRev. Stat. § 138.012(2)(b) (2003)). The Court summarized its analysis by holding,\n\n“The legitimacy of these trial management and evidentiary considerations” and the\n\n“minimally adverse impact the restriction would have” on defendant’s ability to\n\npresent his case indicated the Eighth Amendment was not violated. Id. at 527, 126\n\nS. Ct. at 1233.\n\n\n\n12.   This language is analogous to the Ohio Supreme Court’s logic in Roberts,\n      where it held:\n\n             This case . . . involves a proceeding on remand for the limited\n             purpose of correcting an error that occurred after the defendant\n             had had a full, unlimited opportunity to present mitigating\n             evidence to the sentencer.\n             In other words, neither Lockett nor any of its progeny required\n             the trial court to reopen the evidence after an error-free\n             evidentiary hearing had already taken place.\n\n      998 N.E.2d at 1108 (second emphasis added).\n\n                                          -28-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶45.]       Our balancing in this case and the balancing conducted by the\n\nSupreme Court in Guzek to reject a broadening of Lockett are similar because both\n\ndefendants’ arguments implicated the same court management interest. Berget\n\nseeking a new sentencing hearing by effectively invoking a “right to update one’s\n\nmitigation” is akin to Guzek seeking to treat the sentencing hearing as a second\n\nguilt trial by invoking a “right to reconsideration” of guilt at sentencing. See Guzek,\n\n546 U.S. at 525, 126 S. Ct. at 1232 (citations omitted). If the Court were to adopt\n\nBerget’s position, the Court would establish the incentive to turn a limited\n\nresentencing into a full-fledged, second sentencing hearing by seeking out all newly\n\ndiscoverable mitigation evidence conceivable, again no longer making the original\n\nsentencing proceeding the “main event” but consigning it to a mere “tryout on the\n\nroad.” See Gregory, 449 N.W.2d at 833 (citation omitted). It is also more than\n\nconceivable that Berget may claim new, positive relationships with family members,\n\nfellow prisoners, or strangers for the remainder of his life if this Court permits each\n\nassertion of a relationship to be grounds for a new sentencing hearing or grounds\n\nfor ignoring our limited remand instructions.\n\n[¶46.]       Accordingly, Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper are clearly distinguishable\n\nfrom the present case. No binding authority requires under the Eighth Amendment\n\nthat a resentencing authority consider newly discovered, otherwise-admissible\n\nmitigation evidence, when the defendant had a full and unrestricted opportunity to\n\npresent mitigation evidence at the initial sentencing. Given the negative\n\nconsequences articulated above, Guzek supports our instructions in Berget I. See\n\nGuzek, 546 U.S. at 526, 126 S. Ct. at 1232. These negative consequences include\n\nthe lack of finality, the arbitrariness that a right to update his mitigation would\n                                           -29-\n\f#26764\n\ninject into death penalty jurisprudence, and the destruction of the appellate two-\n\ntiered judicial system and the competencies it fosters. Therefore, we follow Roberts,\n\n998 N.E.2d at 1108-09, and decline to follow Davis V, 475 F.3d at 773, Creech, 947\n\nF.2d at 881-82, and Sivak, 731 P.2d at 197-98. Preventing these discrepancies and\n\ndysfunctions clearly is a rational basis for excluding newly discovered mitigation\n\nevidence from the limited remand for resentencing in this case. Because Berget is\n\nunable to present persuasive authority supporting his position, he has failed to\n\nmeet his onerous burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that this Court’s\n\nstatutory and state constitutional authority to order limited remand violated the\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments in this case. Accordingly, the circuit court did\n\nnot commit legal error and abuse its discretion in following this Court’s instruction\n\non resentencing. 13\n\n\n13.   Berget’s constitutional claim is also subject to prejudicial or harmless error\n      analysis. See St. John, 2011 S.D. 58, ¶ 10, 804 N.W.2d at 74 (quoting Novak\n      v. McEldowney, 2002 S.D. 162, ¶ 7, 655 N.W.2d 909, 912) (“‘An evidentiary\n      ruling will not be overturned unless error is demonstrated and shown to be\n      prejudicial error.’”); Smith, 1999 S.D. 83, ¶ 39, 599 N.W.2d at 353; see also 18\n      U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2)(C) (“The court of appeals shall not reverse or vacate a\n      sentence of death on account of any error which can be harmless, including\n      any erroneous special finding of an aggravating factor, where the\n      Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was\n      harmless.”); SDCL 23A-44-14 (“Any error, defect, irregularity, or variance\n      which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.”); Sweet v.

California, 386 U.S.\n                                                              (continued . . .)\n                                           -30-\n\f#26764\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         18, 22, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 827, 828, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967) (articulating the\n         similar federal standard). This harmless error analysis is particularly salient\n         where, as here, there is “ample evidence relating to the circumstances of the\n         murder.” See State v. Rhines (Rhines I), 1996 S.D. 55, ¶ 101, 548 N.W.2d 415,\n         441. The State has the burden to prove harmless error. State v. Medicine\n         Eagle, 2013 S.D. 60, ¶ 60, 835 N.W.2d 886, 905 (citing State v. Nelson, 1998\n         S.D. 124, ¶ 8, 587 N.W.2d 439, 443).\n\n      The State has proven that the aggravating evidence against Berget is\n      overwhelming beyond a reasonable doubt, thereby negating any claim of\n      constitutional error. Out of all the remaining aggravating evidence—\n      including the brutal nature of the beating and suffocation of Ronald Johnson\n      in carrying out the attempted escape, Berget’s violent criminal history, and\n      the clear existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances of the killing\n      an employee of a corrections institution while Berget was lawfully confined,\n      SDCL 23A-27A-1(7), (8)—none of it would have been called into doubt or\n      otherwise eroded by Berget’s evidence of his relationship with his son and his\n      family. This new evidence could not reasonably expunge or mitigate the\n      circumstances of the murder. “The absence of any prejudice is particularly\n      apparent given the horrific nature of the crime.” McGehee v. Norris, 588 F.3d\n      1185, 1189 (8th Cir. 2009) (citation omitted) (applying harmless error\n      analysis to an alleged Lockett error). Additionally, as noted above, future\n      dangerousness was not the central concern of the sentencing authority. It is\n      even unclear how Berget’s relationship with his family will logically affect his\n      future dangerousness. It is also unclear how Berget’s relationship would\n      have resulted in a life sentence given the circuit court’s awareness of Berget’s\n      son and the testimony of Associate Warden Pontow that Berget could serve a\n      life sentence in administrative segregation to “diminish any serious threat of\n      future dangerousness.” See Hall v. Luebbers, 341 F.3d 706, 717 (8th Cir.\n      2003) (deeming the exclusion of mitigating evidence in a capital case\n      harmless error where it was cumulative).\n\n      Moreover, it is important to note that “South Dakota law does not require the\n      weighing of aggravating circumstances against mitigating factors[,]” and that\n      a sentencing authority, in the face of all manner of mitigating evidence, “need\n      only find one statutory aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt to\n      impose the death penalty.” Page, 2006 S.D. 2, ¶ 50, 709 N.W.2d at 758-59\n      (citing Rhines II, 2000 S.D. 19, ¶¶ 39 n.9, 53, 608 N.W.2d at 312 n.9, 314).\n\n      Therefore, “ample evidence” shows the exclusion of Berget’s relationship with\n      his son in the resentencing authority’s final consideration was a harmless\n      error beyond a reasonable doubt, if it was error at all. Because the circuit\n      court committed no prejudicial error, it did not abuse its discretion in\n      excluding this newly discovered evidence, and on these additional grounds,\n                                                            (continued . . .)\n                                        -31-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶47.]       2.     Whether the circuit court’s resentencing procedure met\n                    statutory and constitutional requirements concerning\n                    Berget’s presence at components of the sentencing\n                    process and allocution.\n\n[¶48.]       If the Court’s limited resentencing instructions pass constitutional\n\nmuster, Berget argues that the circuit court nevertheless erred by not having\n\ngranted him other rights available at sentencing generally—his rights to be\n\nphysically present in the courtroom and to allocute once more before resentencing.\n\nThese issues are questions of law and are therefore subject to de novo review. See\n\nPete Lien & Sons, Inc. v. City of Pierre, 1998 S.D. 38, ¶ 5, 577 N.W.2d 330, 331 (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n[¶49.]              a.   The legality of the circuit court’s entry of its\n                         sentence.\n\n[¶50.]       In support of this argument, Berget interprets a number of diverse\n\nauthorities from federal and state sources. Berget cites Article VI, § 7 of the South\n\nDakota Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]n all criminal\n\nprosecutions the accused shall have the right to defend in person and by counsel; . . .\n\nto meet the witnesses against him face to face . . . .” He goes on to reference SDCL\n\n23A-39-1, which defines this right further by mandating that “[a] defendant shall be\n\npresent at his arraignment, at the time of his plea, at every stage of his trial\n\nincluding the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, and at the\n\nimposition of sentence, except as provided by §§ 23A-39-2 and 23A-39-3.” Because\n\nthese last exceptions are not applicable, and because a defendant’s presence is\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         Berget’s constitutional argument fails. See Smith, 1999 S.D. 83, ¶ 39, 599\n         N.W.2d at 353.\n\n                                          -32-\n\f#26764\n\nrequired “at every stage of his trial,” up to and including “the return of the verdict,”\n\nBerget contends his state constitutional rights were violated by his absence when\n\nthe court reimposed its sentence. Berget argues that federal authority is also\n\npersuasive on this issue because he believes that SDCL chapter 23A-39 was\n\nmodeled after Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Cf. Jacquot v.\n\nRozum, 2010 S.D. 84, ¶ 15, 790 N.W.2d 498, 503 (“This Court routinely looks to\n\nother courts’ decisions for analytical assistance in interpreting a South Dakota rule\n\nof civil procedure that is equivalent to a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.”).\n\n[¶51.]         On this last point, Berget is incorrect. The federal rule and SDCL\n\nchapter 23A-39, while containing some similarities, also contain numerous\n\ndifferences of significance. For example, SDCL 23A-39-3 deals with appearances by\n\ncorporations faced with criminal prosecutions, a subject not addressed by the\n\nfederal rule. The source of SDCL 23A-39 traces its roots back to our earliest\n\ncriminal code while still a Territory. See Dakota Rev. Code Crim. P. §§ 237, 294\n\n(1877). The current version was enacted as part of the general revision of our\n\nCriminal Code in 1978, again with significant differences from the federal rule both\n\nin subject matter and in phraseology. See 1978 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 178, § 485.\n\nTherefore, the persuasive authority of federal courts’ interpretations of Federal\n\nRule 43 language is negligible.\n\n[¶52.]         For case law interpreting SDCL 23A-39-1, Berget cites Kost v. State,\n\n344 N.W.2d 83 (S.D. 1983). 14 In that case, Kost brought a second petition for\n\n\n\n14.      Kost also does not reference Federal Rule 43. Rather, it reviews our previous\n         case law, which goes back to 1904, and which interpreted Territorial criminal\n                                                            (continued . . .)\n                                           -33-\n\f#26764\n\nhabeas corpus after having been found guilty by a jury of first-degree manslaughter\n\nand sentenced to life imprisonment. Id. at 84. The sole issue was whether the trial\n\ncourt denied Kost’s due process rights when Kost was not present at three\n\ndiscussions in chambers, even though his attorney waived his right to be present\n\neach time. Id. at 84. This Court began its discussion by noting that a criminal\n\ndefendant’s right to be present flows from state statutory and constitutional\n\nauthority, as well as the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id.\n\n(citations omitted). The scope of that due process right “requires the defendant ‘to\n\nbe present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably\n\nsubstantial, to the fulness [sic] of his opportunity to defend against the charge.’” Id.\n\n(quoting Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 54 S. Ct. 330, 332, 78 L. Ed.\n\n674, 678 (1934), overruled on other grounds by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.\n\nCt. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964)). See also Kentucky v. Stincer, 482 U.S. 730, 745,\n\n107 S. Ct. 2658, 2667, 96 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1987) (holding that the right to be present\n\nis “not guaranteed when presence would be useless, or the benefit but a shadow”).\n\nAccordingly, this Court determined that the constitutional and statutory right,\n\nconditioned on Snyder, required that “[a] defendant must be present when his\n\npresence is related to an opportunity to defend himself against the criminal charge.”\n\nKost, 344 N.W.2d at 86. This Court equated any other failure to be present, even\n\nthough it may violate the plain language of the statute, to be harmless error. Id. at\n\n\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         procedure. Kost, 344 N.W.2d at 85 (quoting State v. Swenson, 18 S.D. 196,\n         204-05, 99 N.W. 1114, 1116 (1904)).\n\n                                          -34-\n\f#26764\n\n85-86 (citing State v. Rosales, 302 N.W.2d 804, 807 (S.D. 1981)). The circuit court’s\n\njudgment was affirmed based on this harmless error analysis. Id. at 86.\n\n[¶53.]       Applying a similar analysis, Berget’s physical presence at resentencing\n\nwould have been “useless, or the benefit but a shadow” given our remand\n\ninstructions. The circuit court’s resentencing did not, and could not, depend on any\n\nnew evidence from Berget outside of calling Dr. Bean, which Berget declined to do\n\nwhen offered by the circuit court. What remained was for the circuit court to\n\nexercise its discretion in rendering its judgment on the same evidence and\n\nargument that was presented at the initial sentencing hearing. Because of the\n\nunique nature of the alleged error in Berget I, the circuit court only needed to\n\nreconsider its findings of fact and conclusions of law by drafting amendments in\n\nchambers, filing them with the Clerk of Courts, and serving copies on counsel. The\n\nunique posture of the remand begs the question: what was to be gained by having\n\nBerget physically present to watch the circuit court deliberate and hand these\n\ndocuments to the clerk? See United States v. Burton, 543 F.3d 950, 953 (7th Cir.\n\n2008) (“A criminal defendant has no right to be present in the judge’s chambers\n\nwhen she writes her sentencing memorandum or files it with the clerk.”). Because\n\nour instructions in Berget I so limited the jurisdiction of the circuit court on remand\n\nand Berget had no right to be present in chambers while the circuit court\n\ndeliberated in reconsidering its sentence without reference to the Dr. Bean\n\nadmission, the circuit court committed no error in filing new sentencing findings\n\nand conclusions outside Berget’s presence.\n\n[¶54.]       In spite of the distinction between our rules and the federal standard,\n\nBerget argues that at least one court (federal) has categorically found due process\n                                         -35-\n\f#26764\n\nobjections to the absence of a defendant at resentencing, citing United States v.\n\nArrous, 320 F.3d 355, 359 (2d Cir. 2003). Arrous, however, engaged in the very\n\nsame harmless error analysis articulated above to find the defendant’s involuntary\n\nabsence harmless. Id. at 361-62. In explaining its holding further, the Second\n\nCircuit Court of Appeals stated that “defendant’s presence would have made no\n\ndifference in the second sentencing. The decision whether to strike the restitution\n\norder from the judgment or allow Arrous to withdraw his guilty plea was one that\n\nrested solely within the discretion of the district court and did not depend on any\n\ninput from defendant.” Id. at 362. 15 Likewise, in drafting Berget’s resentencing,\n\nthe circuit court was required to consider the identical, preexisting evidence that\n\nBerget and the State presented at the initial sentencing, including Berget’s prior\n\nallocution and arguments of counsel. Again, the circuit court’s resentencing based\n\nupon our limited remand did not, and could not, depend on any new evidence from\n\nBerget outside of calling Dr. Bean, which Berget declined to do. What remained\n\nwas for the circuit court to exercise its discretion in rendering its judgment on the\n\n\n15.   Berget cites another Second Circuit case, United States v. DeMott, 513 F.3d\n      55 (2d Cir. 2008) (per curiam), for the proposition that it is per se prejudicial\n      (and not harmless) error for a court to impose a sentence on a defendant\n      when not in the defendant’s presence. Berget quotes language in DeMott that\n      appears to support this claim: “Since a new sentence was imposed out of the\n      presence of the defendant, his lawyer, and the prosecutor, we cannot\n      confidently decide there has been no harm.” See id. at 58. However, Berget\n      leaves out much of the court’s analysis, including its citation to Arrous and its\n      harmless error analysis. Id. (citing Arrous, 320 F.3d at 361) (“The denial of\n      this right is subject to harmless review, but such error is harmless only\n      where it is ‘unimportant and insignificant’ in the context of the case, such as\n      where . . . ‘defendant’s presence would not have affected the outcome.’”). The\n      DeMott court simply found that defendant’s presence at resentencing in that\n      case would have affected the outcome, see id., thereby distinguishing it from\n      Arrous and, per the analysis above, Berget’s resentencing.\n\n                                         -36-\n\f#26764\n\nsame evidence and argument that was presented at the initial sentencing hearing.\n\nBerget is therefore left without any substantive grounds for asserting he was\n\nprejudiced by his physical absence when the circuit court deliberated, filed the\n\nsentencing documents with the clerk of courts, and mailed copies to counsel.\n\nAccordingly, any error regarding Berget’s physical absence was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and did not contribute to the verdict obtained. See Larson, 512\n\nN.W.2d at 735.\n\n[¶55.]              b.   Berget’s claim for additional allocution.\n\n[¶56.]       Similarly, Berget contends that state and federal authority support his\n\nright to allocute before resentencing, which was denied by the circuit court’s refusal\n\nto conduct a formal resentencing hearing. To advance this contention, he relies on\n\nSDCL 23A-27-1 and this Court’s ruling in State v. Garber, 2004 S.D. 2, 674 N.W.2d\n\n320. The relevant language of SDCL 23A-27-1 is as follows:\n\n             Before imposing a sentence, a court may order a hearing in\n             mitigation or aggravation of punishment. . . . At such hearing,\n             the court shall allow the defense counsel an opportunity to\n             speak on behalf of the defendant and shall address the\n             defendant personally and ask him if he wishes to make a\n             statement in his own behalf and to present any information in\n             mitigation of punishment.\n\nId. On its face, this language describes the allocution right as arising out of a\n\nsentencing hearing ordered by the court. As noted above, the circuit court did not\n\norder a new sentencing hearing because it correctly found no basis for it on remand.\n\nBerget’s right to allocute was not infringed at his original sentencing hearing, the\n\nonly sentencing hearing on the record. The plain language of the statute, therefore,\n\ndoes not support Berget’s claim. Moreover, the only relevance of Garber to this\n\nanalysis is that it referenced in passing that SDCL 23A-27-1 provides a “right of\n                                          -37-\n\f#26764\n\nallocution” and nothing more. See 2004 S.D. 2, ¶ 18, 674 N.W.2d at 325. Without\n\nfurther interpretation, SDCL 23A-27-1 does not explicitly govern the type of limited\n\nresentencing at issue here, nor does it describe the nature of the allocution right.\n\nSouth Dakota case law appears to be silent in both respects.\n\n[¶57.]       Berget contends this Court may draw authority from federal case law\n\nthat purportedly establishes a defendant’s right to allocute at resentencing\n\ngenerally. Federal case law provides that unlike the right to be present, “the right\n\nof allocution is not a constitutional one. Rather, the right of allocution derives from\n\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” United States v. Patterson, 128 F.3d\n\n1259, 1260 (8th Cir. 1997) (per curiam) (citations omitted). It has also been\n\ndescribed as a common law right that relates to a defendant’s constitutional right to\n\nbe present at sentencing. See Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 304, 81 S. Ct.\n\n653, 655, 5 L. Ed. 2d 670 (1961).\n\n[¶58.]       Berget relies on the unpublished opinion of United States v. Blake\n\n(Blake II), No. 12-3176, 501 F. App’x 587, 588 (7th Cir. Feb. 26, 2013), for the\n\nproposition that allocution is also a right provided at limited resentencing. Leading\n\nup to the case, the Seventh Circuit had entered a limited remand for resentencing\n\nin light of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L. Ed. 2d 621\n\n(2005), and its repeal of the mandatory nature of the Federal Sentencing\n\nGuidelines. See Blake II, 501 F. App’x at 588. The trial court then resentenced\n\nBlake, but did not notify him of his ability to speak in his defense. Id. On appeal\n\nfrom the remand, the Seventh Circuit entered a four-sentence unpublished opinion\n\nthat remanded Blake’s case for failure to allow allocution. See United States v.\n\nBlake (Blake I), No. 06-3390, 227 F. App’x 506, 2007 WL 1875958 (7th Cir. June 11,\n                                        -38-\n\f#26764\n\n2007). Both cases give little support for Berget’s argument. Blake I explicitly\n\nstated only the court’s uncertainty whether the denial of Blake’s right of allocution\n\nin that particular circumstance was harmless error. Id. at *1. Blake II merely\n\nreferenced back to Blake I. See Blake II, 501 F. App’x at 588.\n\n[¶59.]       In contrast, the Ninth Circuit, in its published opinion in United States\n\nv. Silva, 472 F.3d 683 (9th Cir. 2007), directly addressed a defendant’s right to\n\nallocute on limited remand. As with Blake, the Ninth Circuit in Silva had issued a\n\nlimited remand for resentencing Silva in the wake of Booker. Id. at 685. This\n\nlimited remand “require[d] the district court to make a subjective determination,\n\nbased upon a review of the record and the submissions of counsel, as to whether the\n\nsentence would have been materially different under advisory Guidelines.” Id. The\n\ncourt noted that because the court properly “evaluated the record, considered the\n\nviews of counsel, and concluded that he would have chosen the same sentence under\n\na discretionary regime[,]” Silva had “no right . . . even to be present during such a\n\nlimited inquiry, and so by necessary implication . . . [authority] does not support a\n\nright to allocute therein.” Id. at 686. While the court acknowledged the federal\n\nrulemaking and case law authority establishing allocution as a general, necessary\n\ncomponent of a criminal defendant’s due process rights, see id. at 686-87, it further\n\nnoted, “[W]e have decided that allocution is not always necessary in the case of\n\nsentencing error.” Id. at 687. The court illustrated the limits of the allocution right\n\nby harkening to its earlier opinion in United States v. Knows His Gun, 438 F.3d 913\n\n(9th Cir. 2006). In Knows His Gun, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a sentence where the\n\ntrial court, on remand in light of Booker, failed to permit allocution. Id. at 920.\n\nRecounted later in Silva, the Ninth Circuit noted that the key factor was Knows His\n                                        -39-\n\f#26764\n\nGun’s ability at his original sentencing to present all relevant evidence and to\n\nallocute. See Silva, 472 F.3d at 687 (citing Knows His Gun, 438 F.3d at 919-20)\n\n(“We affirmed . . . because the defendant had already had a chance to present non-\n\nGuidelines evidence at the original sentencing and needed no further right to\n\nallocute.”). The court then applied that rationale to Silva, and held that because the\n\nlimited remand “merely requires review of the record and the views of counsel, due\n\nprocess does not require allocution.” Id. at 687-88.\n\n[¶60.]       The clear parallels between Berget’s case and Silva indicate that the\n\ndue process afforded to Berget on limited remand did not implicate Berget’s right to\n\nallocution. Like the Ninth Circuit’s directive in Silva, we instructed on remand that\n\nthe circuit court was to conduct its review “on the existing record.” See Berget I,\n\n2013 S.D. 1, ¶ 120, 826 N.W.2d at 37. Akin to Silva, we effectively tasked the lower\n\ncourt with making “a subjective determination, based upon a review of the record\n\nand the submissions of counsel, as to whether [Berget’s] sentence would have been\n\n[] different” absent the improper consideration. See Silva, 472 F.3d at 685. The\n\ncircuit court then appropriately considered only the existing record, including the\n\nprior allocution, and the views of counsel in making its decision. The circuit court\n\nwas not required to grant additional allocution because Berget was already given a\n\nchance to submit all relevant evidence and to allocute at his sentencing hearing.\n\nSilva provides that no due process right to allocute exists within the limited remand\n\nframework we instructed in Berget I given the similarities of our instructions. This,\n\ncoupled with SDCL 23A-27-1’s plain language does not support Berget’s\n\ninterpretation. Berget offers no persuasive authority on which to base his\n\nallocution right.\n                                         -40-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶61.]       Further, even if there were a right of allocution in this instance, any\n\nfailure of the circuit court to provide Berget this right was harmless error. See\n\nUnited States v. Robertson, 537 F.3d 859, 863 & n.3 (8th Cir. 2008) (applying\n\nharmless error analysis to an allocution error). Recognizing the similar nature of\n\nthe right to be present and the right to allocute (albeit the allocution right involves\n\na lesser, common law concern), see Silva, 472 F.3d at 686, a similar harmless error\n\nframework may be applied. This Court’s instruction on remand narrowed the\n\ncircuit court’s consideration of new mitigating evidence. By this instruction,\n\nBerget’s ability to re-allocute, after electing not to introduce Dr. Bean’s testimony,\n\nbecame immaterial. With the removal of Dr. Bean’s report from consideration, the\n\nevidence upon which Berget could allocute was the same evidence upon which he\n\nallocuted at the initial sentencing hearing. Nothing changed. And because the\n\nresentencing court indicated it would consider his prior allocution, Berget could not\n\nhave influenced the circuit court’s resentencing decision when all the court had to\n\nconsider was the preexisting record. Cf. Kost, 344 N.W.2d at 86 (“[Defendant’s]\n\nabsence from these discussions was not error because his presence was not\n\nnecessary to defend against the charges.”). As noted above, the language of SDCL\n\n23A-37-1 does not provide a right of allocution at this limited resentencing, and\n\neven if it did, the resulting error at Berget’s resentencing would be harmless beyond\n\na reasonable doubt because it could not, and would not, contribute to the sentence\n\nrendered. See Larson, 512 N.W.2d at 735.\n\n[¶62.]        Therefore, Berget provides no persuasive authority to support a right\n\nto allocution in the limited remand proceedings directed by Berget I. If the court\n\n\n                                          -41-\n\f#26764\n\nerred in not providing for allocution, that error was harmless. Accordingly, his\n\nclaim fails.\n\n[¶63.]         3.    Whether the circuit court erred in not recusing itself\n                     prior to resentencing.\n\n[¶64.]         Berget asserts the circuit court erred by denying his request that the\n\ncourt recuse itself on limited remand, citing the court’s actual and implied judicial\n\nbias. This argument stems from Berget’s allegation that the court simply recycled\n\nits findings of fact and conclusions of law from those in the case of Berget’s co-\n\ndefendant, Eric Robert. In his initial brief, Berget characterized this allegation as\n\nindicating the court gave his case little consideration, which in turn evidenced bias.\n\nBerget now modifies this argument in his reply brief and in oral argument by\n\nasserting that the court was “trying to be fair in a situation where no mortal could\n\nbe.” Berget further explains that the court was more inherently—rather than\n\nintentionally—biased because it had to prejudge Berget’s case, having already\n\nsentenced his co-defendant on similar findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nBerget relates that for the court to change its findings from Robert’s case to Berget’s\n\ncase would be to “call the finality of the [Robert] decision . . . into question.”\n\n[¶65.]         Berget admits that SDCL 15-12-24 statutorily precluded his affidavit\n\nfor change of judge because he submitted argument to the circuit court—admitting\n\nguilt and receiving sentence—prior to filing the affidavit. He bases the court’s duty\n\nto recuse on a superseding, general constitutional right to a fair trial, citing Nelson,\n\n1998 S.D. 124, ¶ 14, 587 N.W.2d at 445 (citations omitted) (outlining the scope of a\n\nright to a fair trial), and Page, 2006 S.D. 2, ¶ 14, 709 N.W.2d at 749 (quoting State\n\nv. Hoadley, 2002 S.D. 109, ¶ 32, 651 N.W.2d 249, 257) (“[A] defendant’s ‘opportunity\n\n                                           -42-\n\f#26764\n\nto disqualify a judge is statutory, . . . and not a constitutional right, except as it may\n\nbe implicit in a right to a fair trial.’”).\n\n[¶66.]         This argument fails. Berget had argued on direct appeal that\n\nsimilarities between the verdicts from his and Robert’s pre-sentencing hearing\n\nindicate a violation of Berget’s right to an individualized sentencing determination\n\nunder Lockett. Berget I, 2013 S.D. 1, ¶¶ 53-54, 826 N.W.2d at 18-19. This Court\n\nrejected that argument. We did so based on our finding that “Berget has not\n\n‘presented any evidence to constitute a legitimate basis on which to call into\n\nquestion the circuit judge’s impartiality. . . . Absent such a showing that a fair\n\njudgment was impossible, it was not error for the circuit judge to sentence [Berget]\n\nafter sentencing his co-defendant [Robert].’” Id. ¶ 54, 826 N.W.2d at 18 (quoting\n\nPage, 2006 S.D. 2, ¶ 17, 709 N.W. 2d at 751). 16 This finding echoed our prior\n\nholdings in Page, 2006 S.D. 2, ¶¶ 15-17, 709 N.W.2d at 750-51, and Hoadley, 2002\n\nS.D. 109, ¶¶ 32-34, 651 N.W.2d at 257-58, that the mere fact the circuit court\n\npreviously sentenced a co-defendant to death does not show the judicial bias, or the\n\n“deep-seated favoritism or antagonism,” that overrides the presumption against\n\nrecusal that the court was impartial. Berget’s attempt to distinguish this case from\n\nPage and Hoadley fails. To accept Berget’s argument would prohibit the trying of\n\nco-defendants by the same judge in all cases as a matter of law. Berget offers no\n\n\n\n\n16.      Rather, we explained that the similarity in the presentence verdicts’\n         recitation of facts was the logical and proper result of a court approaching a\n         joint murder by co-defendants. Id. ¶ 52. Here, that analysis also applies\n         with equal effect to Berget’s argument on the court’s amended findings of fact\n         and conclusions of law.\n\n                                              -43-\n\f#26764\n\nlegitimate indication of the court’s bias to modify our prior analysis. This argument\n\ntherefore fails.\n\n[¶67.]        4.    Whether Berget’s sentence was imposed under the\n                    influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\n                    factor.\n\n[¶68.]        Our analysis of the record indicates no basis for finding Berget’s\n\nsentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other\n\narbitrary factor. See SDCL 23A-27A-12(1). The circuit court’s amended\n\npresentence hearing verdict and amended findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nreflect the proper scope of analysis directed by this Court on limited remand. As\n\nindicated above, Berget’s assertion of circuit court bias, actual and inherent, was\n\nshown to have no merit on direct appeal and remains without merit. Berget I, 2013\n\nS.D. 1, ¶ 54, 826 N.W.2d at 18-19. No improper considerations indicating passion,\n\nprejudice, or arbitrariness were otherwise evident on direct appeal. Id. ¶ 13, 826\n\nN.W.2d at 11. That continues to be the case here.\n\n[¶69.]        5.    Whether the evidence supports the circuit court’s finding\n                    of statutory aggravating circumstances as enumerated in\n                    SDCL 23A-27A-1.\n\n[¶70.]        We noted in Berget I that evidence introduced at Berget’s sentencing\n\nhearing supported, beyond a reasonable doubt, the circuit court’s finding of two\n\nstatutory aggravating circumstances evident in Ronald Johnson’s murder. See id.\n\n¶¶ 16-17, 826 N.W.2d at 11; see also SDCL 23A-27A-1(7) (“The offense was\n\ncommitted against a law enforcement officer, employee of a corrections institution,\n\nor firefighter while engaged in the performance of such person’s official duties[.]”);\n\n23A-27A-1(8) (“The offense was committed by a person in, or who has escaped from,\n\nthe lawful custody of a law enforcement officer or place of lawful confinement[.]”).\n                                        -44-\n\f#26764\n\nSince then, Berget has brought forth no evidence or argument to question those\n\nholdings. Further inquiry is therefore unnecessary. The evidence supports the\n\ncircuit court’s finding of the two statutory aggravating circumstances.\n\n[¶71.]       6.     Whether Berget’s death sentence is excessive or\n                    disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\n                    considering both the crime and the defendant.\n\n[¶72.]       Finally, because “[w]e strictly and purposely limited our remand\n\ninstructions in [Berget I] to correct the specific error that had occurred,” see Piper\n\nIII, 2014 S.D. 2, ¶ 12, 842 N.W.2d at 343, and because Berget acknowledges without\n\nobjection that all proportionality concerns raised in Berget I were addressed and\n\naffirmed by our opinion, our prior proportionality analysis stands, see Berget I, 2013\n\nS.D. 1, ¶¶ 18-31, 826 N.W.2d at 11-14. The record continues to provide no basis for\n\nthis Court to find Berget’s death sentence to be excessive or disproportionate. In\n\nthe absence of the Court’s instruction, the aggravating circumstances of Berget’s\n\ncrime and the remaining aggravating factors would nevertheless outweigh any\n\nreasonable implications of Berget’s new relationship—no matter how positive—with\n\nhis son and his son’s family. We conclude that our prior proportionality analysis\n\nremains valid and Berget’s death sentence is not excessive or disproportionate in\n\nrelation to similar cases where the death penalty was imposed.\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n[¶73.]       This Court, pursuant to the South Dakota Constitution, possesses the\n\nclear authority to direct the jurisdictional scope of a limited remand to the circuit\n\ncourt, and our remand directions in Berget I did not infringe upon any of Berget’s\n\nconstitutional rights. The limited remand also did not implicate or otherwise\n\nviolate Berget’s rights to be present and to allocution. Finally, this Court previously\n                                         -45-\n\f#26764\n\nrejected, in Berget I, Berget’s judicial bias argument, and he has provided no\n\nadditional, substantive argument in that regard on this appeal. We therefore affirm\n\nhis death sentence.\n\n[¶74.]       ZINTER and SEVERSON, Justices, and MILLER, Retired Justice,\n\nconcur.\n\n[¶75.]       KONENKAMP, Justice, dissents.\n\n[¶76.]       MILLER, Retired Justice, sitting for WILBUR, Justice, disqualified.\n\n\n\nKONENKAMP, Justice (dissenting on Issue 1).\n\n[¶77.]       When a death sentence is reversed and remanded for resentencing,\n\nand the sentencing court is thus required to determine anew whether to impose a\n\nsentence of life or death, there is no rational basis to deny the defendant the\n\nopportunity to present for the court’s deliberation any newly available mitigation\n\nevidence. It makes no difference here whether our remand was limited. The\n\nsentencing court was ordered to “conduct a sentencing without” the error in the\n\nprevious sentencing, and therefore, it had to reevaluate all the appropriate factors\n\nand evidence, absent the erroneously considered matter. Federal constitutional law\n\nand our own jurisprudence require that the sentencing court consider any new\n\nmitigation evidence.\n\n                                           I.\n\n[¶78.]       Death is the ultimate penalty. It cannot be undone. It is thus an\n\n“‘indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death’” that the\n\nsentencing process “permit the consideration of the ‘character and record of the\n\nindividual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense[.]’” Lockett v.\n                                       -46-\n\f#26764\n\nOhio, 438 U.S. 586, 601, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 2963, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978) (quoting\n\nWoodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304, 96 S. Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L. Ed. 2d\n\n944 (1976)); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 4, 106 S. Ct. 1669, 1670-71, 90 L.\n\nEd. 2d 1 (1986). Yet, after today’s decision, courts will be required to ignore any\n\ncurrent mitigation evidence in deciding life or death if that court is resentencing an\n\noffender because of an error in the previous sentencing process. This limitation\n\n“creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which\n\nmay call for a less severe penalty[,]” a risk “unacceptable and incompatible with the\n\ncommands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.” See Lockett, 438 U.S. at\n\n605, 98 S. Ct. at 2965. Our Court ignores the fundamental tenets of the Eighth\n\nAmendment in holding, as a matter of law, that a defendant sentenced to death has\n\nno right to present newly discovered, otherwise admissible, mitigating evidence\n\nwhen resentenced, because that defendant had an opportunity to present mitigation\n\nevidence at the original sentencing hearing.\n\n[¶79.]         A right to mitigate one’s sentence in a capital case is not merely a\n\nstatutory right, but a constitutional guarantee. Id. at 608, 98 S. Ct. at 2967.\n\nContrary to the Court’s claim, Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper are not clearly\n\ndistinguishable; nor is this case akin to Roberts, 998 N.E.2d at 1108 or Guzek, 546\n\nU.S. 517, 126 S. Ct. 1226. 17 This case directly implicates the precept that in order\n\n\n17.      Despite this Court’s claim, Guzek is not “instructive in a broader sense.” See\n         supra Majority Opinion ¶ 44. Guzek ruled that a defendant is not entitled to\n         present new evidence of his innocence during a sentencing hearing because\n         the guilt and sentencing phases are different, the issue of guilt had already\n         been litigated, and trial management and evidentiary considerations control.\n         546 U.S. at 526-27, 126 S. Ct. at 1232-33. Here, however, Berget’s attempt to\n         introduce new mitigation evidence at sentencing in no way implicates the\n                                                              (continued . . .)\n                                            -47-\n\f#26764\n\nto decide “a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be\n\ntaken or spared,” see Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189, 96 S. Ct. at 2932 (citing Furman, 408\n\nU.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 276), “the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the\n\nsentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from\n\nconsidering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s character or record\n\nand any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for\n\na sentence less than death.” See Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964-65.\n\n[¶80.]       Other courts have likewise held that the holding in Skipper, 476 U.S.\n\nat 8, 106 S. Ct. at 1672-73, that a defendant should be allowed to present any\n\navailable mitigating evidence requires that, at resentencing, a court must consider\n\nany new evidence that the defendant has developed since the initial sentencing\n\nhearing. See, e.g., Davis v. Coyle, 475 F.3d 761, 771 (6th Cir. 2007); Robinson v.\n\nMoore, 300 F.3d 1320, 1345-48 (11th Cir. 2002); Smith v. Stewart, 189 F.3d 1004,\n\n1008-14 (9th Cir. 1999); Spaziano v. Singletary, 36 F.3d 1028, 1032-35 (11th Cir.\n\n1994); Alderman v. Zant, 22 F.3d 1541, 1556-57 (11th Cir. 1994); Creech v. Arave,\n\n\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         guilt phase and does not involve an issue already litigated (his sentence was\n         vacated). Moreover, there is no comparable concern for trial management\n         and evidentiary consideration. On the contrary, before resentencing a\n         defendant, the court must consider the character and history of the defendant\n         before it. Considering newly discovered, otherwise admissible, mitigation\n         evidence fulfills that duty. Because Guzek specifically involved the difference\n         between the guilt and sentencing phases and in no way addressed what\n         evidence is admissible when a defendant is resentenced, Guzek bears no\n         instructive value here.\n\n                                          -48-\n\f#26764\n\n947 F.2d 873, 881 (9th Cir. 1991), rev’d on other grounds by Arave v. Creech, 507\n\nU.S. 463, 113 S. Ct. 1534, 123 L. Ed. 2d 188 (1993); Sivak, 731 P.2d at 197-98. 18\n\n                                            II.\n\n[¶81.]         Our own precedent also dictates that it is error not to consider Berget’s\n\nnewly available, otherwise admissible, mitigation evidence. In Bult IV, this Court\n\nmade clear that a sentencing court has the duty to “acquaint itself thoroughly ‘with\n\nthe character and history of the man before it,’” and a failure to do so denies a\n\ndefendant “a meaningful sentencing hearing in accordance with our statutes and\n\ngeneral principals of due process.” 1996 S.D. 20, ¶¶ 8, 13, 544 N.W.2d at 216-17\n\n(quoting State v. Pack, 516 N.W.2d 665, 667 (S.D. 1994)). We reversed Bult’s\n\nsentence specifically because the sentencing court failed to consider Bult’s current\n\nmitigation evidence, despite the fact that Bult had an error-free original sentencing\n\nhearing ten years earlier. See id. ¶ 14.\n\n[¶82.]         In 1983, Bult had been sentenced to life without the possibility of\n\nparole, a sentence originally affirmed and later reversed. State v. Bult (Bult I), 351\n\nN.W.2d 731 (S.D. 1984); Bult v. Leapley (Bult II), 507 N.W.2d 325, 328 (S.D. 1993).\n\nAfter Bult’s first resentencing hearing, during which the court held a full\n\nevidentiary hearing, the sentencing court again sentenced Bult to life without the\n\npossibility of parole. Bult III, 529 N.W.2d at 199. On appeal for the third time, we\n\nreversed the sentence and “remand[ed] again for resentencing, with instructions\n\n18.      The Court’s concern here about the “negative consequences” of allowing\n         newly available mitigation evidence at resentencing was adequately\n         answered by the Idaho Supreme Court in Sivak: “Needless to say, a\n         sentencing judge will not have to consider such post-sentence mitigation\n         evidence as will be submitted in this case if [the judge] conducts a proper\n         sentencing procedure in the first place.” Id. at 198 n.3.\n\n                                           -49-\n\f#26764\n\nthat the sentencing court shall impose an appropriate term of years.” Id. at 200.\n\nWe did not specifically instruct the court to conduct a full sentencing hearing. Id.\n\nYet, when, on remand, the sentencing court did not hold a new evidentiary hearing\n\nand sentenced Bult to 300 years, Bult appealed asserting that his 300-year sentence\n\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment and that he was denied a meaningful\n\nsentencing hearing. Bult IV, 1996 S.D. 20, ¶¶ 6-7, 544 N.W.2d at 216.\n\n[¶83.]       On appeal, we held that a sentencing court had an “obligation,” on\n\nremand for resentencing, to update itself on what actions the defendant had taken\n\nbetween the reversal of the court’s resentence and the court’s second rehearing to\n\npronounce a new sentence. Id. ¶ 12. We did not rely on the “nature of the error,” or\n\nlanguage from Bult III that “permitted a full sentencing hearing on remand[.]” See\n\nsupra Majority Opinion n.9. We also did not express concern for maintaining\n\n“judicial efficiency” and avoiding “arbitrary outcomes.” Rather, we focused on the\n\nsentencing court’s duty to thoroughly acquaint itself with the current character and\n\nhistory of the defendant before it.\n\n                                         III.\n\n[¶84.]       “Sentencing decisions are perhaps the most difficult responsibility for\n\ntrial judges, encompassing circumstances both obvious and elusive.” State v.\n\nBonner, 1998 S.D. 30, ¶ 11, 577 N.W.2d 575, 578. The task becomes even more\n\ndifficult when we declare, as a matter of law, that trial courts must cull out previous\n\nportions of their deliberations on resentencing, but cannot consider current\n\nmitigation that may bear on the question of life or death. Because resentencing\n\nrequires courts to reevaluate and reweigh the factors that went into their initial\n\ndecision, they should also consider any new evidence that the defendant has\n                                         -50-\n\f#26764\n\ndeveloped since the initial sentencing hearing. Doing otherwise infringes on Eighth\n\nAmendment protections and violates our own established jurisprudence.\n\n[¶85.]       Berget’s sentence should be remanded for a new sentencing hearing.\n\nThis result is the only one consistent with our precedent and “ensure[s] the\n\nreliability, under Eighth Amendment standards, of the determination that ‘death is\n\nthe appropriate punishment in a specific case.’” See Lockett, 438 U.S. at 601, 98 S.\n\nCt. at 2963 (quoting Woodson, 428 U.S. at 305, 96 S. Ct. at 2991).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -51-\n\f",

On direct\n\nappeal of that sentence, in State v. Berget (Berget I), this Court determined that the\n\ncircuit court may have improperly considered, for sentencing purposes, statements\n\nmade by Berget in a psychological evaluation procured to determine his competency\n\nto stand trial. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 92, 119, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28, 37. We remanded\n\nBerget’s death sentence for the limited purpose of resentencing “without the use of\n\nor consideration of” the psychological evaluation unless Berget opted to call its\n\nauthor to testify, and otherwise “on the existing record.” Id. ¶¶ 118, 120, 826\n\nN.W.2d at 37.

This\n\nappeal concerns the limited remand instructed in Berget I and proceedings\n\nsubsequent thereto. The relevant facts are provided below.\n\n[¶3.]        In Berget I, this Court affirmed Berget’s death sentence on eleven of\n\ntwelve issues. See id. ¶ 121, 826 N.W.2d at 37. The twelfth issue regarded the\n\ncircuit court’s potentially improper consideration of aggravating evidence in\n\nrendering Berget’s death sentence. Id. ¶¶ 91-118, 826 N.W.2d at 28-37.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -1-\n\f#26764\n\nSpecifically, we noted that after the sentencing hearing, 1 when the circuit court\n\nannounced its sentence, the court indicated that it had considered Berget’s early\n\nacceptance of responsibility for the murder of Ronald Johnson as mitigation. Id. ¶\n\n92, 826 N.W.2d at 28. However, the circuit court then cited an admission Berget\n\ngave during a psychiatric evaluation, which was contained in a report to determine\n\nBerget’s fitness to stand trial. The evaluation had previously been sealed and was\n\nnot admitted as evidence in the sentencing hearing. Id. It contained Berget’s\n\nadmission to the psychiatrist, Dr. David Bean, that he pleaded guilty to Johnson’s\n\nmurder because he “wish[ed] it would be over.” Id. The circuit court stated that\n\nthis admission did not reflect the intentionality that made early acceptance a\n\nmitigating factor. Id. On appeal, we agreed with Berget that the circuit court\n\nmight have committed prejudicial error by improperly considering this admission as\n\naggravating evidence. Id. ¶¶ 116-118, 826 N.W.2d at 36-37.\n\n[¶4.]         To address this error, this Court concluded its opinion with\n\ninstructions: “Pursuant to SDCL 23A-27A-13(2), we remand to the circuit court for\n\nthe purpose of conducting a sentencing without this error. Per this statute, it is to\n\nbe conducted on the existing record without reference to, or considering of, the\n\nreport of Dr. Bean.” 2 Id. ¶ 120, 826 N.W.2d at 37.\n\n\n\n1.      The sentencing court took the matter under advisement and pronounced its\n        initial sentence four days after the completion of the initial sentencing\n        hearing. There is no dispute Berget had an unrestricted opportunity to\n        present all mitigation evidence he desired the court to consider at the\n        sentencing hearing.\n\n2.      We also instructed that Berget could “opt[ ] to call Dr. Bean to testify.” Id. ¶\n        118, 826 N.W.2d at 37. This was the only new evidence—in addition to the\n                                                              (continued . . .)\n                                          -2-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶5.]        On the day after this Court handed down its opinion and judgment, the\n\nState filed a motion for a hearing consistent with the opinion of this Court. The\n\nState acknowledged in its motion that it would not object to Berget introducing the\n\npsychiatric report “with such supplemental direct and cross-examination testimony\n\nof the psychiatrist as Berget might choose to place on the record.” Berget filed a\n\npetition for rehearing on the appeal, which we subsequently denied by order entered\n\nJanuary 22, 2013.\n\n[¶6.]        A month after we handed down our opinion and judgment, Berget sent\n\na letter to the circuit court, pursuant to SDCL 15-12-21.1, requesting that it\n\ndisqualify itself from the remanded proceeding on grounds of judicial bias. In his\n\naffidavit supporting recusal, Berget claimed three instances of bias: (1) the circuit\n\ncourt had to find against Berget’s assertions of fact at sentencing or it would risk\n\ncontradicting its findings of fact and jeopardizing the death sentence in the case of\n\nBerget’s co-defendant, Eric Robert, (2) the Supreme Court had found that the circuit\n\ncourt committed error in its presentence hearing verdict, and (3) the circuit court\n\nhad rendered its sentencing decision “through legal analysis only.” The circuit court\n\ndenied Berget’s request for recusal on February 22, 2013. The Presiding Circuit\n\nJudge of the Second Judicial Circuit entered an order on March 8, 2013, denying\n\nBerget’s formal recusal request. The Presiding Judge based the order on Berget’s\n\nwaiver of his right to disqualify the circuit court, pursuant to SDCL 15-12-24, by\n\n(. . . continued)\n         record at the time of sentencing and the arguments of counsel thereon—that\n         the circuit court could have considered for sentencing purposes on remand.\n         The transcript of the remand motions hearing indicates the circuit court\n         repeatedly inquired whether Berget wanted to exercise the option of calling\n         Dr. Bean to testify. Berget responded in the negative each time.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f#26764\n\nhim having already “submitted multiple arguments and proofs in support of\n\nmotions” to the court prior to his request for recusal.\n\n[¶7.]        Berget also filed a demand for a new sentencing hearing to introduce\n\nnew evidence. That evidence, allegedly obtainable only after his original\n\nsentencing, showed that “Berget has established a meaningful relationship with his\n\nson, his daughter-in-law, and his two grandchildren,” and that the relationship “has\n\nmade a positive impact on the lives of [Berget’s] family, even while [Berget is] in\n\nprison for the rest of his life.” Berget argued, in spite of this Court’s clear directions\n\non remand, that the circuit court “ha[d] the inherent power to grant a new\n\n[sentencing] hearing” and that his federal constitutional rights required it do so.\n\n[¶8.]        The circuit court held a motions hearing on Berget’s demand for a\n\nhearing on April 16, 2013. Berget repeatedly declined the circuit court’s offer to\n\nhave Dr. Bean testify. He reasserted his federal constitutional law arguments and\n\ncontention that the circuit court had the authority to grant a new sentencing\n\nhearing in the face of contrary remand directions by this Court. Berget further\n\nargued that our remand instructions were improper because we could not rely on\n\nSDCL 23A-27A-13(2) to justify our limited remand for resentencing and that our\n\ndirections on remand were otherwise unclear. Finally, Berget reinforced his\n\nargument that his father-son relationship evidence was new and had not been\n\nwithheld for dilatory reasons. The circuit court rejected Berget’s arguments by\n\nnoting that our instructions on remand were clear, that as a circuit court it was\n\nbound to limit its jurisdiction on remand to those instructions, and that a new\n\nsentencing hearing would violate our directive. The circuit court declined to make a\n\nruling on Berget’s constitutional arguments because it determined that they were\n                                        -4-\n\f#26764\n\noutside its limited remand jurisdiction. After considering Berget’s offer of proof—\n\nand without further evidence to consider beyond the evidence, argument and\n\nallocution it considered in Berget’s original sentencing—the circuit court\n\ndetermined that another sentence hearing would serve no purpose given our\n\nremand instructions, and it orally denied Berget’s demand for a new sentencing\n\nhearing.\n\n[¶9.]         The circuit court entered a written order on May 7, 2013, denying\n\nBerget’s motions for a sentencing hearing, to introduce new mitigation evidence,\n\nand to disqualify itself. That same day, the court entered its amended presentence\n\nhearing verdict. Thereafter, both the State and Berget submitted proposed findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law. After considering the proposed amended findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law from Berget and the State, and the objections thereto,\n\nthe circuit court notified the parties that it would adopt the State’s amended\n\nfindings and conclusions in the court’s e-mail of June 7, 2013. The court’s amended\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law were entered that day. The court entered an\n\namended judgment of conviction and sentence, and the death warrant, on June 24,\n\n2013. Berget timely appealed. This Court entered an order for stay of execution on\n\nAugust 7, 2013. 3\n\n\n\n3.      Because of the limited scope of remand and the clarity of the issues presented\n        by both parties, the Court originally anticipated considering this appeal on\n        the written arguments of counsel and without oral argument during its April\n        2014 Term. That determination is normally at the discretion of the Court.\n        See SDCL 15-26A-82. However, we received notice that the Legislature\n        placed an additional procedural requirement on the Court in cases where a\n        circuit court imposes capital punishment: “Both the defendant and the state\n        shall have the right . . . to present oral argument to the court.” SDCL 23A-\n                                                               (continued . . .)\n                                              -5-\n\f#26764\n\n                                        Analysis\n\n[¶10.]          Berget now raises three issues in appealing his resentence on remand.\n\nBerget’s first and second arguments derive from the circuit court’s denial of Berget’s\n\ndemand for a new sentencing hearing. He argues the court erred (1) by failing to\n\nconsider his newly discovered mitigation evidence in reimposing his death sentence\n\nand (2) by preventing him from being present and being able to allocute when it\n\nreimposed its sentence. Berget’s third argument is that the circuit court erred by\n\nrefusing to recuse itself from resentencing. In addition to Berget’s issues, SDCL\n\n23A-27A-12 requires that this Court make three determinations whenever a circuit\n\ncourt imposes the death penalty, specifically:\n\n                (1)   Whether the sentence of death was imposed under the\n                      influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\n                      factor; and\n                (2)   Whether the evidence supports the jury’s or judge’s\n                      finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as\n                      enumerated in § 23A-27A-1; and\n                (3)   Whether the sentence of death is excessive or\n                      disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\n                      considering both the crime and the defendant.\n\nId.   4\n\n\n[¶11.]          1.    Whether the circuit court was required to consider\n                      Berget’s new mitigation evidence in its judgment upon\n                      limited remand.\n\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         27A-11. Because Berget exercised that right, we heard oral argument in this\n         matter during the May 2014 Term.\n\n4.        Although these issues were addressed in the prior direct appeal, and SDCL\n          23A-27A-12 is silent as to whether they must be addressed on appeal of a\n          limited resentencing, we nevertheless address these questions after\n          analyzing the errors Berget advances on this appeal.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶12.]       As noted above, Berget made an offer of proof at the remand motions\n\nhearing regarding the nature and scope of the alleged newly discovered mitigation\n\nevidence of Berget’s positive relationship with his son and his son’s family. Berget\n\nfaults the circuit court’s exclusion of this evidence from its sentencing deliberation\n\nby advancing two theories. First, Berget challenges both the “clarity” of this Court’s\n\ninstructions for a limited remand for resentencing in Berget I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 118,\n\n120, 826 N.W.2d at 37, and the statutory authority that we relied on, in part, to so\n\nlimit the scope of the limited resentencing, id. ¶ 120 (citing SDCL 23A-27A-13(2)).\n\nSecond, Berget asserts that even if there was statutory authority to support limiting\n\nthe scope of remand, that limitation on the admission of his new mitigation\n\nevidence violated his Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n\n[¶13.]       Upon review, “‘[a] [circuit] court’s evidentiary rulings are presumed\n\ncorrect and will not be reversed unless there is a clear abuse of discretion.’” Wilcox\n\nv.

This Court’s authority to direct a limited\n                         resentencing upon remand.\n\n[¶15.]       Berget argues this Court’s remand instructions “somewhat perplexed”\n\nthe circuit court. Berget attests that this “confusion is understandable” because the\n\nstatute cited by the Court, SDCL 23A-27A-13(2), as additional authority for its\n\nlimited resentencing instruction, was not proper authority on that point. Instead,\n\nnoting the language of the statute, Berget believes this provision only authorizes a\n\nlimited resentencing when the Court remands a death sentence for proportionality\n\nissues. Because this Court in Berget I affirmed each of the proportionality issues\n\ntherein argued by Berget, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 18-31, 826 N.W.2d at 11-14, he contends\n\nthat our limited remand and the subsequent limited resentencing violated state\n\nlaw.\n\n[¶16.]       First, regarding Berget’s assertion of “confusion”—nowhere in the\n\ntranscript of the motions hearing or elsewhere on the record did the circuit court\n\nexpress confusion with this Court’s instructions. As the hearing transcript\n\nindicates, the court restated our directions, noted their clarity, and in the face of\n\nBerget’s constitutional assertions, adhered to them. Only Berget’s oral argument\n\nasserted any “confusion,” and did so as the basis of argument.\n\n[¶17.]       Whether or not this Court misconstrued SDCL 23A-27A-13 in citing it\n\nas additional authority for its limited remand instructions is immaterial.

The Court in Gregg\n\nclarified that the prior case, which effectively abolished the death penalty\n\nnationwide, Furman v.

Instead, “Furman held that [the\n\ndeath penalty] could not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a\n\nsubstantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.”\n                                          -10-\n\f#26764\n\nId. To prevent this, the Court began by applying the common precept of sentencing\n\nthat in mitigation or aggravation, “‘justice generally requires . . . that there be\n\ntaken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and\n\npropensities of the offender.’” Id. at 189, 96 S.

The\n\nCourt then acknowledged that much of this evidence, although relevant for\n\nsentencing purposes, would be properly excluded as prejudicial or irrelevant on the\n\nquestion of guilt. Id. at 190, 96 S. Ct. at 2933. Because a jury “cannot be expected\n\nto consider certain evidence before it on one issue, but not another,” id. at 190 n.40,\n\n96 S. Ct. at 2933 n.40 (citations omitted), the Court suggested solving the challenge\n\nthrough a bifurcated trial, wherein a determination of guilt occurs first, and then, if\n\nthe defendant is found guilty, a determination of whether a death sentence will\n\nissue, see id. at 190-92, 96 S. Ct. at 2933-34.\n\n[¶23.]       Although Gregg provided a starting point on the definition of\n\nadmissible mitigation evidence, its common sentencing definition was soon\n\nbroadened. Because of the severity of the death penalty, a plurality of the United\n\nStates Supreme Court determined “the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nrequire that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be\n\nprecluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant’s\n\ncharacter or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant\n\nproffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.” See Lockett v.

Such liberality achieved this consistency by providing a\n\n“meaningful basis for distinguishing the . . . cases in which [the death penalty] is\n\nimposed from . . . the many cases in which it is not.” Id. (citing Gregg, 428 U.S. at\n\n188, 96 S. Ct. at 2932). That plurality holding became the majority position in\n\nEddings v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct. at 875 (adopting the plurality opinion in Lockett). Accordingly, at sentencing,\n\n“virtually no limits are placed on the relevant mitigating evidence a capital\n\ndefendant may introduce concerning his own circumstances.” See Payne v.\n\nTennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct. at 876-77. “The sentencer, and the Court of\n\nCriminal Appeals on review, may determine the weight to be given relevant\n\nmitigating evidence. But they may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence\n\nfrom their consideration.” Id. at 114-15, 102 S. Ct. at 877.\n\n[¶25.]       Berget argues this broad scope of relevant mitigating evidence requires\n\nthat we adopt his position. However, the concern in this case is narrower and\n                                       -12-\n\f#26764\n\nregards a matter outside the bifurcated trial procedure established in Gregg to\n\nwhich the requirements of a broad scope of relevant mitigating evidence and their\n\nmandated consideration by the sentencing authority (Lockett and Eddings)\n\nexplicitly apply. The issue, rather, is whether the Eighth and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments prohibit this Court from narrowing the circuit court’s jurisdiction,\n\nupon a limited remand for resentencing in a capital case, such that the court could\n\nnot consider relevant evidence for mitigation purposes discoverable only after\n\nremand. 5\n\n[¶26.]         Berget relies on Skipper v. South Carolina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111657\"><a href=\"/opinion/111657/skipper-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111657\"><a href=\"/opinion/111657/skipper-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, (1986), which held that new, relevant mitigating evidence may be\n\nintroduced at least through a capital defendant’s period of incarceration while\n\nawaiting trial. In that case, Skipper and his former wife testified during the\n\nsentencing phase that he had “conducted himself well during the 7½ months he\n\nspent in jail between his arrest and trial” and had earned his high school diploma.\n\nId. at 3, 106 S. Ct. at 1670. He asserted that this behavior was indicative of his\n\nfuture conduct in custody and that his sentence should therefore have been reduced\n\nto life imprisonment. Id. In further support, Skipper sought to introduce testimony\n\nfrom jailers and a “regular visitor” to the jail that he had “made a good adjustment,”\n\nindicating his future adaptability to prison life. Id. The sentencing court ruled that\n\nsuch evidence was irrelevant and therefore inadmissible, citing state case law that a\n\ndefendant’s ability to adjust to life behind bars could not be relevant to capital\n\n\n5.       The circuit court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law entered after its\n         original sentencing indicate that at that time it was known to Berget and the\n         circuit court that Berget had a son.\n\n                                          -13-\n\f#26764\n\nsentencing. Id. The sentencing jury subsequently sentenced Skipper to death. Id.\n\nOn appeal, Skipper asserted that the sentencing court had committed constitutional\n\nerror, pursuant to Lockett and Eddings, by excluding the relevant, mitigating\n\ntestimony of the jailers and the visitor. Id.\n\n[¶27.]       The Supreme Court agreed with Skipper. While the Court admitted\n\nthat “any such inferences” arising out of the “good adjustment” testimony “would\n\nnot relate specifically to petitioner’s culpability for the crime he committed,” the\n\nCourt found that this testimony nevertheless provided mitigation inferences “in the\n\nsense that [the inferences] might serve ‘as a basis for a sentence less than death.’”\n\nId. at 4-5, 106 S. Ct. at 1671 (quoting Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964).\n\nThe Court implied that this “basis for a sentence less than death” arose out of its\n\nprevious holding that “evidence that a defendant would in the future pose a danger\n\nto the community if he were not executed may be treated as establishing an\n\n‘aggravating factor’ for purposes of capital sentencing.” Id. (citing Jurek v. Texas,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109534\"><a href=\"/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109534\"><a href=\"/opinion/109534/jurek-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court reasoned that if evidence of a future danger\n\ncould always be admissible as aggravating evidence, then evidence indicating the\n\ninverse—that a defendant “would not pose a danger if spared (but incarcerated)”—\n\nwas applicable to death penalty cases generally as a “potentially mitigating” factor.\n\nId. at 5. As such a factor, it “[could] not be excluded from the sentencer’s\n\nconsideration.” Id. The Court concluded, “‘any sentencing authority must predict a\n\nconvicted person’s probable future conduct when it engages in the process of\n\ndetermining what punishment to impose.’” Id. at 5, 106 S. Ct. at 1671 (quoting\n\nJurek, 428 U.S. at 275, 96 S. Ct. at 2958). Because the sentencing court excluded\n                                         -14-\n\f#26764\n\nthe future conduct testimony of the jailers and visitor from the sentencing jury, the\n\nCourt determined the sentencing court had violated Skipper’s Eighth Amendment\n\nright to present all mitigating evidence. See id. at 4, 106 S. Ct. at 1671.\n\n[¶28.]         Evidence of Berget’s newfound relationship with his son and his son’s\n\nfamily conceivably could have been relevant evidence that Berget would not pose a\n\ndanger in prison if spared, particularly under Lockett’s broad instruction that “any\n\naspect of [the] defendant’s character . . . that the defendant proffers as a basis for a\n\nsentence less than death” can be mitigating information. 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct.\n\nat 2964-65. Taking Skipper and Lockett together, then, Berget’s relationship may\n\nhave been evidence the court could not have excluded from its consideration if\n\nBerget offered it at any point prior to completion of the sentencing portion of the\n\ntrial. See Skipper, 476 U.S. at 5, 106 S. Ct. at 1671.\n\n[¶29.]         Berget’s constitutional argument, however, relies on extending the\n\nwindow for unconstitutional exclusion of new mitigation evidence further, to include\n\nmitigating information discoverable only after the original sentencing and offered\n\nbefore resentencing. 6 To find authority supporting this proposition, Berget relies on\n\nthe Skipper Court’s instructions on remand. See id. at 8, 106 S. Ct. at 1673 (“The\n\nresulting death sentence cannot stand, although the State is of course not precluded\n\nfrom again seeking to impose the death sentence, provided that it does so through a\n\nnew sentencing hearing at which petitioner is permitted to present any and all\n\n6.

The\n\nSkipper Court’s instruction of a new sentencing hearing was the necessary result of\n\nthe sentencing court’s error in excluding mitigation evidence from a sentencing\n\njury’s consideration, thereby tainting the subsequent sentencing hearing. A new,\n\nfull sentencing hearing was “necessary” because it would be required to probe the\n\nvalue of the wrongly excluded testimony, since its contribution to the sentencing\n\nauthority’s weighing 7 of mitigating and aggravating factors was otherwise\n\nundefined. Consequently, the sentencing authority could have given the wrongly\n\nexcluded mitigating factor such weight that it alone was grounds for a life sentence.\n\n\n7.       Our use of the word “weighing” in this context does not contradict the fact\n         that South Dakota is a non-weighing state. See State v.

Unlike Lockett,\n\nEddings and Skipper, the circuit court here did not improperly exclude evidence\n\nfrom the sentencing hearing, but only improperly considered evidence (if it did so at\n\nall) after the hearing was completed, during its deliberation. See Berget I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 119, 826 N.W.2d at 37. The sentencing hearing itself was not tainted because\n\nBerget exercised the unrestricted opportunity to introduce all mitigating evidence\n\nhe desired. 8 Furthermore, once the Dr. Bean report was excluded, the remaining\n\n\n8.       Berget asserts that because the court received Dr. Bean’s report before the\n         sentencing hearing, its mere existence in the record in that phase of the\n         proceeding—albeit sealed throughout the hearing—was sufficient to taint the\n         entire sentencing phase. Objectively, however, there was no indication in the\n         hearing transcript or elsewhere that the court improperly considered Berget’s\n         admission to Dr. Bean or unsealed the report until its deliberation in drafting\n         its presentence hearing verdict. The report was not offered into evidence or\n         even mentioned at the sentencing hearing.

In order for the Court to adopt Berget’s argument, we\n         would need to speculate on the mental processes of the court, which we will\n         not do.\n\n         If the court erred, then, it did so by improper weighing of mitigation evidence.\n         See Berget I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 118, 826 N.W.2d at 37. That error is an order of\n         magnitude lower than if the court had excluded mitigating evidence from its\n         consideration. The constitution clearly prohibits exclusion of relevant,\n         mitigating evidence obtained before sentencing in a capital decision. See\n         Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604, 98 S. Ct. at 2964-65. The necessary remedy for\n         violating this prohibition is remand to the circuit court for its consideration of\n         all relevant mitigating evidence. See Eddings, 455 U.S. at 117, 102 S. Ct. at\n         878. The same cannot be said for the improper consideration of aggravating\n         evidence. The constitution, in fact, permits an appellate court to reweigh the\n         proper evidence and impose the death penalty in response to an error in the\n         trial court’s weighing of the evidence.

In the past, this Court has not hesitated to require a full sentencing hearing\n      on remand in a death penalty case when the nature of the error warranted\n      that outcome.

The constitutional\n      error in Piper II occurred before the sentencing hearing, and the nature of the\n      error affected the entire sentencing proceeding. In contrast, the error\n      prompting Berget’s limited resentencing occurred after the sentence hearing,\n      and did not taint the hearing. Again, only the circuit court’s possible\n      consideration of improper aggravating evidence may have needed correction,\n      requiring a limited remand, if any.

On an appeal of a denial of a petition for writ of\n\nhabeas corpus, Davis sought to challenge his Ohio death sentence. The Ohio\n\nSupreme Court had affirmed Davis’s convictions but vacated his death sentence\n\nbecause, as with Berget I, the sentencing authority (a three-judge panel) may have\n\nconsidered improper aggravating factors in its sentence. Id. at 763. The sentencing\n\ncourt, on remand for “a new sentencing trial” as instructed by the appellate court,\n\nconsidered only the record of the trial and first sentencing proceeding. The court\n\nrefused to consider Davis’s motion to withdraw his jury waiver and to introduce new\n\nmitigation testimony concerning his post-prison behavior and updated psychological\n\nprofile. Id. at 769. The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed the court’s resentencing,\n\n10.      On a petition for rehearing in response to this Court’s opinion on direct\n         appeal, Berget offered this same argument, citing Skipper, to cast doubt on\n         the propriety of this Court’s limited remand.

The appeals court further noted that\n\nbecause the error requiring remand “‘occurred at the deliberative state of the\n\nproceedings, after the evidence had been submitted to the court,’” the sentencing\n\ncourt need not consider additional evidence. Id. The Ohio Supreme Court affirmed\n\non slightly different grounds, finding that unlike Skipper, Davis had the\n\nopportunity to present all then-available mitigation evidence at his first sentencing\n\ntrial and was therefore not denied the “individual consideration of relevant\n\nmitigating factors” that was the crux of Skipper, Eddings, and Lockett. Id. (quoting\n\nState v. Davis (Davis IV), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195 (Ohio 1992)). Moreover, the Court\n\nfound that Skipper only applied to mitigation evidence of a good prison record\n\nbetween a defendant’s arrest and trial, and not to post-trial prison behavior. Id. at\n\n772 (citing Davis IV, 584 N.E.2d at 1195).\n\n[¶34.]       The Sixth Circuit rejected this collected reasoning. The court\n\nprimarily drew comparisons between Davis’s case on resentencing and Skipper at\n\nsentencing—both prosecutors introduced evidence or argument of defendants’\n\ndangerousness behind bars and both defendants faced “future dangerousness” as\n\nthe “central” aggravating factors in their sentences. Compare Skipper, 476 U.S. at\n\n2, 3, 106 S. Ct. at 1670, with Davis V, 475 F.3d at 771-72. The court determined\n\nthat the only way to distinguish the two cases was that Skipper involved sentencing\n\nand Davis’s case involved resentencing. See id. at 773. The court found that to be\n\nan unreasonable basis for denying the application of Skipper to Davis’s case. Id.\n                                       -21-\n\f#26764\n\nThe Davis court also concluded that the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits already\n\nsupported the application of Skipper to resentencing. 11 Accordingly, the court found\n\nthat only a new, full resentencing hearing could permit the proper weighing of the\n\nimproperly excluded new mitigation testimony. Id. at 774-75.\n\n[¶35.]         The State, in contrast, cites the Ohio Supreme Court case of State v.\n\nRoberts, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1100</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ohio 2013), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Roberts, on direct appeal, the Court affirmed Roberts’s convictions of\n\naggravated murder and both aggravated circumstances therein, but remanded for\n\nlimited resentencing because the trial judge engaged in ex parte communications\n\nwith the prosecutor in drafting the sentencing opinion. Id. at 1104. The Court\n\n\n11.      Only one Ninth Circuit case cited in Davis V actually addresses whether new\n         mitigation evidence, constitutionally speaking, must be admitted at\n         resentencing after the defendant was given the opportunity to present all\n         mitigation evidence at his original sentencing. See 475 F.3d at 782 (Gibbons,\n         Cir. J., concurring) (noting only one case was so “on point”). That case is\n         Creech v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996). Creech\n         based its finding that Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper “required that a\n         defendant be allowed to offer such mitigating evidence at resentencing” on\n         the Idaho Supreme Court’s ruling in Sivak v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1424362\"><a href=\"/opinion/1424362/sivak-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (Idaho\n         1986). The Ninth Circuit justified its ruling by stating, “Like the Idaho\n         Supreme Court, we see no rational basis for distinguishing the evidence of a\n         defendant’s good conduct while awaiting trial and sentencing, and evidence of\n         a defendant’s good conduct pending review of a death sentence which is\n         vacated on appeal.” Creech, 947 F.2d at 881-82 (internal citations omitted).\n         The Idaho Supreme Court’s logic was that if the mitigating relevance of a\n         capital defendant’s prison behavior is to show “his probable future conduct at\n         the penitentiary, and hence, the appropriateness of the death penalty as\n         opposed to a life sentence[,]” then there is no qualitative difference between\n         pre-sentence and post-sentence prison conduct for mitigation purposes.\n         Sivak, 731 P.2d at 197-98. If anything, according to the Idaho Supreme\n         Court, defendant’s behavior in jail awaiting sentencing may be a less reliable\n         indicator of future conduct in the penitentiary than defendant’s actual\n         conduct at the penitentiary post-sentence, making this new post-sentence\n         mitigation evidence more reliable. Id.\n\n                                          -22-\n\f#26764\n\nspecified on remand that Roberts had a right to allocute and that the trial court was\n\nto reweigh the evidence and “personally prepare an entirely new penalty opinion.”\n\nId. On remand, Roberts filed a motion to introduce new mitigation evidence,\n\nincluding prison records, a disability claim file, an affidavit from Roberts’s\n\npsychologist offering a preliminary diagnosis, and a letter about Roberts from her\n\nson. Id. at 1104-05. That motion was denied. Id. at 1105. The trial court heard\n\nRoberts’s allocution and sentenced her to death.\n\n[¶36.]       On appeal, the Court rejected Roberts’s assertion that the sentencing\n\ncourt erred in precluding her from presenting new mitigating evidence on remand.\n\nThe Court distinguished Skipper, Lockett, and Eddings as inapplicable because\n\nthose cases “involved a situation where the capital sentencer was prohibited, in\n\nsome form or another, from considering relevant mitigating evidence at trial. . . .\n\n[N]o relevant mitigating evidence was ever excluded from consideration during\n\n[Roberts’s] penalty phase.’” Id. at 1107 (first two alterations in original) (quoting\n\nState v. Chinn, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1180-81 (Ohio 1999)). “In other words, neither\n\nLockett nor any of its progeny required the trial court to reopen the evidence after\n\nan error-free evidentiary hearing had already taken place.” Id. at 1108 (citing\n\nChinn, 709 N.E.2d at 1180-81). Instead, the error in question occurred after the\n\nevidentiary sentencing proceeding had closed; therefore, “the trial court was\n\nrequired to proceed on remand from the point at which the error occurred[.]” Id. at\n\n1110 (quoting Chinn, 709 N.E.2d at 1181). Otherwise, the Court would create an\n\nunauthorized “right to update one’s mitigation. Such a right has no clear basis in\n\nLockett or its progeny.” Id. at 1108.\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶37.]       Beyond an inability to reconcile Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper to this\n\nalleged right to update one’s mitigation evidence, the Court rejected Roberts’s\n\nargument as causing untenable results. The Court reasoned that:\n\n             Establishing a right to update mitigation could result in\n             arbitrary distinctions between similarly situated capital\n             defendants. A defendant who had an error-free mitigation\n             hearing could not update his mitigation—no matter how\n             compelling the new mitigation that might be available to him—\n             if the trial judge committed no error after the mitigation hearing\n             that called for the case to be remanded. But another defendant,\n             whose mitigation hearing was equally free of error, would have\n             the right to update his mitigation in the event that a\n             posthearing sentencing error took place that required a remand.\n\nId.\n\n[¶38.]       Both Davis V and Roberts provide reasoning for whether or not\n\nSupreme Court precedent gives indirect authority that a court, on limited\n\nresentencing, must consider new mitigation evidence. Two key factors, however,\n\npoint to Roberts being the persuasive authority.\n\n[¶39.]       First, the Sixth Circuit based its decision in Davis V on the salient\n\naggravating circumstance shared in both Davis and Skipper. “[T]he core of the\n\nanalysis in Skipper reflects the Court’s understanding that the right of a defendant\n\nto present evidence of good behavior in prison is particularly relevant when a\n\nprediction of future dangerousness figures centrally in a prosecutor’s plea for\n\nimposition of the death penalty.” Davis V, 475 F.3d at 771 (emphasis added).\n\n“Although there could conceivably be some question about the relevance of such\n\nevidence in the abstract, the record in this case establishes without doubt that [the\n\nnewly discovered evidence on remand] was highly relevant to the single aggravating\n\nfactor relied upon by the state—that future dangerousness should keep Davis on\n\n                                         -24-\n\f#26764\n\ndeath row.” Id. at 773 (emphasis added). Therefore, according to the court, Skipper\n\nwas substantively distinguishable from Davis’s situation “solely on the basis of\n\ntiming,” and it applied Skipper to require a full resentencing. See id.\n\n[¶40.]       In contrast, the two statutory aggravating circumstances under which\n\nthe court sentenced Berget to death did not relate to his future dangerousness per\n\nse, but to the nature of the murder he committed. See SDCL 23A-27A-1(7), (8)\n\n(“[t]he offense was committed against a[n] . . . employee of a corrections institution,”\n\nand “[t]he offense was committed by a person in . . . the lawful custody of . . . a place\n\nof lawful confinement”). These statutory aggravating circumstances do not include\n\nfuture dangerousness as a consideration. Moreover, the circuit court considered\n\nBerget’s future dangerousness as one among four other non-statutory aggravating\n\ncircumstances. The court’s original and amended presentence hearing verdicts\n\nindicate the court also took into account: (1) the violent nature of Berget’s attack on\n\nJohnson, (2) that a life sentence would have no deterrent effect on other inmates\n\nsimilarly situated to Berget, (3) that Berget had a long criminal history of ever-\n\nincreasing violence outside of prison, and (4) that Berget showed a lack of remorse\n\nto Johnson’s family. Berget’s future dangerousness undoubtedly played a role in\n\nthe court’s penalty analysis, but that aggravating concern did not predominate as it\n\ndid in Davis or Skipper. Since this “central role” is the basis of the Sixth Circuit’s\n\nreasoning in Davis V, Berget’s reliance on that case is questionable.\n\n[¶41.]       Second, and most importantly, however, the negative consequences of\n\nadopting Berget’s position, as noted in Roberts, make Roberts the persuasive\n\nauthority. For instance, as noted above, under SDCL 23A-27A-12(2) we are\n\nstatutorily charged with an independent determination of “whether the evidence\n                                       -25-\n\f#26764\n\nsupports . . . [a] judge’s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance as\n\nenumerated in § 23A-27A-1.” Because of this duty, were we to accept Berget’s\n\nrationale that Skipper and Davis V require consideration of newly discovered post-\n\ntrial mitigation evidence in every capital case, this Court would open the door to\n\nbecoming the initial trier of fact for evidence never presented or considered by the\n\ncircuit court. Under Berget’s rationale, this Court, when presented with new post-\n\ntrial evidence upon appeal, “could be considered a ‘sentencer’ for Lockett purposes.”\n\nSee Roberts, 998 N.E.2d at 1108-09. This, again, would thwart the judicial economy\n\nof our tiered judicial system. See Piper III, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 10, 842 N.W.2d at 343. It\n\nwould also no longer make the original sentencing proceeding the “main event” but\n\nimproperly relegate it to a mere “tryout on the road.” See Gregory v. Solem, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 833 (S.D. 1989) (citing Wainwright v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610 (1977)).\n\n[¶42.]       Additionally, the Roberts Court’s finding of arbitrary discrepancies\n\nthat may manifest between similarly situated capital defendants simply because of\n\na post-sentence error in deliberation is clearly applicable in this case. No\n\nsentencing error existed in the case of Berget’s co-defendant, Eric Robert. See State\n\nv. Robert, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Had Robert proceeded with his case and\n\ntried to raise a similar argument of post-sentencing discovery of evidence he deemed\n\nto be mitigating, under the rationale now advanced by Berget, Berget could obtain a\n\nsecond sentencing hearing while Robert could not. Therefore, the circumstances of\n\ntheir offenses and the individual “character and propensities” of each defendant—\n\nthe fundamental concerns of sentencing, see Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189, 96 S. Ct. at\n\n2932 (citations omitted)—would not result in their distinct sentencing treatments;\n                                       -26-\n\f#26764\n\nthey would result from a potential, extraneous court error that occurred after\n\nsentencing. That strikes at the heart of Lockett’s holding that the death penalty\n\nshould be imposed “in a more consistent and rational manner[,]” based on an\n\nanalysis of the fundamental concerns of sentencing. See Lockett, 438 U.S. at 601,\n\n605, 98 S. Ct. at 2963, 2965.\n\n[¶43.]       It is that very interest in achieving a “more rational and equitable\n\nadministration of the death penalty” that the Supreme Court found to be the basis\n\nfor allowing states the “authority to set reasonable limits upon the evidence a\n\ndefendant can submit, and to control the manner in which it is submitted[,]”\n\nincluding mitigation evidence, in capital cases. See Oregon v. Guzek, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145676\"><a href=\"/opinion/145676/oregon-v-guzek/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n526, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145676\"><a href=\"/opinion/145676/oregon-v-guzek/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006). A reasonable limit is one that\n\nwe impose today that avoids the arbitrary outcomes and judicial inefficiency noted\n\nin Roberts and reinforces an appellate court’s authority to instruct a limited\n\nremand.\n\n[¶44.]        The Supreme Court’s ruling in Guzek is also instructive in a broader\n\nsense. In Guzek, the issue relevant to this case was whether the Eighth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments granted Guzek the right to introduce new evidence of his\n\ninnocence at his sentencing hearing—namely, that he was not present at the scene\n\nof the crime. Id. at 523, 126 S. Ct. at 1230. The Court rejected the Oregon Supreme\n\nCourt’s broadening of Lockett to provide an Eighth Amendment right for Guzek to\n\nintroduce newly discovered evidence of his innocence at a sentencing hearing. Id. at\n\n523, 126 S. Ct. at 1230-31. The Court grounded its ruling on three conclusions.\n\nFirst, the Court noted that, fundamentally, “evidentiary concerns” are different\n\nbetween guilt and sentencing phases, with the former concern asking whether the\n                                       -27-\n\f#26764\n\ndefendant committed the crime and the latter asking how the act was committed.\n\nId. at 526, 126 S. Ct. at 1232. Second, the Court found that “the parties previously\n\nlitigated the issue to which the evidence is relevant—whether the defendant\n\ncommitted the basic crime. The evidence thereby attacks a previously determined\n\nmatter in a proceeding at which, in principle, that matter is not at issue. The law\n\ntypically discourages collateral attacks of this kind.” Id. (citing Allen v. McCurry,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110360\"><a href=\"/opinion/110360/allen-v-mccurry/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980)). Third, the Court\n\ndetermined that any “negative impact of a rule restricting defendant’s ability to\n\nintroduce new alibi evidence is minimized by the fact that Oregon law gives the\n\ndefendant the right to present to the sentencing jury all the evidence of innocence\n\nfrom the original trial regardless.” 12 Id. at 526-27, 126 S. Ct. at 1233 (citing Or.\n\nRev. Stat. § 138.012(2)(b) (2003)). The Court summarized its analysis by holding,\n\n“The legitimacy of these trial management and evidentiary considerations” and the\n\n“minimally adverse impact the restriction would have” on defendant’s ability to\n\npresent his case indicated the Eighth Amendment was not violated. Id. at 527, 126\n\nS. Ct. at 1233.\n\n\n\n12.   This language is analogous to the Ohio Supreme Court’s logic in Roberts,\n      where it held:\n\n             This case . . . involves a proceeding on remand for the limited\n             purpose of correcting an error that occurred after the defendant\n             had had a full, unlimited opportunity to present mitigating\n             evidence to the sentencer.\n             In other words, neither Lockett nor any of its progeny required\n             the trial court to reopen the evidence after an error-free\n             evidentiary hearing had already taken place.\n\n      998 N.E.2d at 1108 (second emphasis added).\n\n                                          -28-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶45.]       Our balancing in this case and the balancing conducted by the\n\nSupreme Court in Guzek to reject a broadening of Lockett are similar because both\n\ndefendants’ arguments implicated the same court management interest. Berget\n\nseeking a new sentencing hearing by effectively invoking a “right to update one’s\n\nmitigation” is akin to Guzek seeking to treat the sentencing hearing as a second\n\nguilt trial by invoking a “right to reconsideration” of guilt at sentencing. See Guzek,\n\n546 U.S. at 525, 126 S. Ct. at 1232 (citations omitted). If the Court were to adopt\n\nBerget’s position, the Court would establish the incentive to turn a limited\n\nresentencing into a full-fledged, second sentencing hearing by seeking out all newly\n\ndiscoverable mitigation evidence conceivable, again no longer making the original\n\nsentencing proceeding the “main event” but consigning it to a mere “tryout on the\n\nroad.” See Gregory, 449 N.W.2d at 833 (citation omitted). It is also more than\n\nconceivable that Berget may claim new, positive relationships with family members,\n\nfellow prisoners, or strangers for the remainder of his life if this Court permits each\n\nassertion of a relationship to be grounds for a new sentencing hearing or grounds\n\nfor ignoring our limited remand instructions.\n\n[¶46.]       Accordingly, Lockett, Eddings, and Skipper are clearly distinguishable\n\nfrom the present case. No binding authority requires under the Eighth Amendment\n\nthat a resentencing authority consider newly discovered, otherwise-admissible\n\nmitigation evidence, when the defendant had a full and unrestricted opportunity to\n\npresent mitigation evidence at the initial sentencing. Given the negative\n\nconsequences articulated above, Guzek supports our instructions in Berget I. See\n\nGuzek, 546 U.S. at 526, 126 S. Ct. at 1232. These negative consequences include\n\nthe lack of finality, the arbitrariness that a right to update his mitigation would\n                                           -29-\n\f#26764\n\ninject into death penalty jurisprudence, and the destruction of the appellate two-\n\ntiered judicial system and the competencies it fosters. Therefore, we follow Roberts,\n\n998 N.E.2d at 1108-09, and decline to follow Davis V, 475 F.3d at 773, Creech, 947\n\nF.2d at 881-82, and Sivak, 731 P.2d at 197-98. Preventing these discrepancies and\n\ndysfunctions clearly is a rational basis for excluding newly discovered mitigation\n\nevidence from the limited remand for resentencing in this case. Because Berget is\n\nunable to present persuasive authority supporting his position, he has failed to\n\nmeet his onerous burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that this Court’s\n\nstatutory and state constitutional authority to order limited remand violated the\n\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments in this case. Accordingly, the circuit court did\n\nnot commit legal error and abuse its discretion in following this Court’s instruction\n\non resentencing. 13\n\n\n13.

It is also unclear how Berget’s relationship would\n      have resulted in a life sentence given the circuit court’s awareness of Berget’s\n      son and the testimony of Associate Warden Pontow that Berget could serve a\n      life sentence in administrative segregation to “diminish any serious threat of\n      future dangerousness.” See Hall v.

The legality of the circuit court’s entry of its\n                         sentence.\n\n[¶50.]       In support of this argument, Berget interprets a number of diverse\n\nauthorities from federal and state sources. Berget cites Article VI, § 7 of the South\n\nDakota Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[i]n all criminal\n\nprosecutions the accused shall have the right to defend in person and by counsel; . . .\n\nto meet the witnesses against him face to face . . . .” He goes on to reference SDCL\n\n23A-39-1, which defines this right further by mandating that “[a] defendant shall be\n\npresent at his arraignment, at the time of his plea, at every stage of his trial\n\nincluding the impaneling of the jury and the return of the verdict, and at the\n\nimposition of sentence, except as provided by §§ 23A-39-2 and 23A-39-3.” Because\n\nthese last exceptions are not applicable, and because a defendant’s presence is\n\n\n(. . . continued)\n         Berget’s constitutional argument fails. See Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 39, 599\n         N.W.2d at 353.\n\n                                          -32-\n\f#26764\n\nrequired “at every stage of his trial,” up to and including “the return of the verdict,”\n\nBerget contends his state constitutional rights were violated by his absence when\n\nthe court reimposed its sentence. Berget argues that federal authority is also\n\npersuasive on this issue because he believes that SDCL chapter 23A-39 was\n\nmodeled after Rule 43 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Cf. Jacquot v.\n\nRozum, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 15, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 503 (“This Court routinely looks to\n\nother courts’ decisions for analytical assistance in interpreting a South Dakota rule\n\nof civil procedure that is equivalent to a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.”).\n\n[¶51.]         On this last point, Berget is incorrect. The federal rule and SDCL\n\nchapter 23A-39, while containing some similarities, also contain numerous\n\ndifferences of significance. For example, SDCL 23A-39-3 deals with appearances by\n\ncorporations faced with criminal prosecutions, a subject not addressed by the\n\nfederal rule. The source of SDCL 23A-39 traces its roots back to our earliest\n\ncriminal code while still a Territory. See Dakota Rev. Code Crim. P. §§ 237, 294\n\n(1877). The current version was enacted as part of the general revision of our\n\nCriminal Code in 1978, again with significant differences from the federal rule both\n\nin subject matter and in phraseology. See 1978 S.D. Sess. Laws ch. 178, § 485.\n\nTherefore, the persuasive authority of federal courts’ interpretations of Federal\n\nRule 43 language is negligible.\n\n[¶52.]         For case law interpreting SDCL 23A-39-1, Berget cites Kost v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D. 1983). 14 In that case, Kost brought a second petition for\n\n\n\n14.      Kost also does not reference Federal Rule 43. Rather, it reviews our previous\n         case law, which goes back to 1904, and which interpreted Territorial criminal\n                                                            (continued . . .)\n                                           -33-\n\f#26764\n\nhabeas corpus after having been found guilty by a jury of first-degree manslaughter\n\nand sentenced to life imprisonment.

What remained was for the circuit court to\n\nexercise its discretion in rendering its judgment on the same evidence and\n\nargument that was presented at the initial sentencing hearing. Because of the\n\nunique nature of the alleged error in Berget I, the circuit court only needed to\n\nreconsider its findings of fact and conclusions of law by drafting amendments in\n\nchambers, filing them with the Clerk of Courts, and serving copies on counsel. The\n\nunique posture of the remand begs the question: what was to be gained by having\n\nBerget physically present to watch the circuit court deliberate and hand these\n\ndocuments to the clerk?

Again, the circuit court’s resentencing based\n\nupon our limited remand did not, and could not, depend on any new evidence from\n\nBerget outside of calling Dr. Bean, which Berget declined to do.

Berget quotes language in DeMott that\n      appears to support this claim: “Since a new sentence was imposed out of the\n      presence of the defendant, his lawyer, and the prosecutor, we cannot\n      confidently decide there has been no harm.” See id. at 58. However, Berget\n      leaves out much of the court’s analysis, including its citation to Arrous and its\n      harmless error analysis. Id. (citing Arrous, 320 F.3d at 361) (“The denial of\n      this right is subject to harmless review, but such error is harmless only\n      where it is ‘unimportant and insignificant’ in the context of the case, such as\n      where . . . ‘defendant’s presence would not have affected the outcome.’”). The\n      DeMott court simply found that defendant’s presence at resentencing in that\n      case would have affected the outcome, see id., thereby distinguishing it from\n      Arrous and, per the analysis above, Berget’s resentencing.\n\n                                         -36-\n\f#26764\n\nsame evidence and argument that was presented at the initial sentencing hearing.\n\nBerget is therefore left without any substantive grounds for asserting he was\n\nprejudiced by his physical absence when the circuit court deliberated, filed the\n\nsentencing documents with the clerk of courts, and mailed copies to counsel.\n\nAccordingly, any error regarding Berget’s physical absence was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt and did not contribute to the verdict obtained. See Larson, 512\n\nN.W.2d at 735.\n\n[¶55.]              b.   Berget’s claim for additional allocution.\n\n[¶56.]       Similarly, Berget contends that state and federal authority support his\n\nright to allocute before resentencing, which was denied by the circuit court’s refusal\n\nto conduct a formal resentencing hearing. To advance this contention, he relies on\n\nSDCL 23A-27-1 and this Court’s ruling in State v. Garber, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"901296\"><a href=\"/opinion/901296/state-v-garber/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The relevant language of SDCL 23A-27-1 is as follows:\n\n             Before imposing a sentence, a court may order a hearing in\n             mitigation or aggravation of punishment. . . . At such hearing,\n             the court shall allow the defense counsel an opportunity to\n             speak on behalf of the defendant and shall address the\n             defendant personally and ask him if he wishes to make a\n             statement in his own behalf and to present any information in\n             mitigation of punishment.\n\nId. On its face, this language describes the allocution right as arising out of a\n\nsentencing hearing ordered by the court. As noted above, the circuit court did not\n\norder a new sentencing hearing because it correctly found no basis for it on remand.\n\nBerget’s right to allocute was not infringed at his original sentencing hearing, the\n\nonly sentencing hearing on the record. The plain language of the statute, therefore,\n\ndoes not support Berget’s claim. Moreover, the only relevance of Garber to this\n\nanalysis is that it referenced in passing that SDCL 23A-27-1 provides a “right of\n                                          -37-\n\f#26764\n\nallocution” and nothing more.

Without\n\nfurther interpretation, SDCL 23A-27-1 does not explicitly govern the type of limited\n\nresentencing at issue here, nor does it describe the nature of the allocution right.\n\nSouth Dakota case law appears to be silent in both respects.\n\n[¶57.]       Berget contends this Court may draw authority from federal case law\n\nthat purportedly establishes a defendant’s right to allocute at resentencing\n\ngenerally. Federal case law provides that unlike the right to be present, “the right\n\nof allocution is not a constitutional one. Rather, the right of allocution derives from\n\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” United States v.

Leading\n\nup to the case, the Seventh Circuit had entered a limited remand for resentencing\n\nin light of United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

App’x at 588. The trial court then resentenced\n\nBlake, but did not notify him of his ability to speak in his defense. Id. On appeal\n\nfrom the remand, the Seventh Circuit entered a four-sentence unpublished opinion\n\nthat remanded Blake’s case for failure to allow allocution. See United States v.\n\nBlake (Blake I), No. 06-3390, 227 F. App’x 506, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1875958</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir.

Blake I explicitly\n\nstated only the court’s uncertainty whether the denial of Blake’s right of allocution\n\nin that particular circumstance was harmless error. Id. at *1. Blake II merely\n\nreferenced back to Blake I. See Blake II, 501 F. App’x at 588.\n\n[¶59.]       In contrast, the Ninth Circuit, in its published opinion in United States\n\nv. Silva, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796374\"><a href=\"/opinion/796374/united-states-v-paul-silva/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2007), directly addressed a defendant’s right to\n\nallocute on limited remand. As with Blake, the Ninth Circuit in Silva had issued a\n\nlimited remand for resentencing Silva in the wake of Booker. Id. at 685. This\n\nlimited remand “require[d] the district court to make a subjective determination,\n\nbased upon a review of the record and the submissions of counsel, as to whether the\n\nsentence would have been materially different under advisory Guidelines.” Id. The\n\ncourt noted that because the court properly “evaluated the record, considered the\n\nviews of counsel, and concluded that he would have chosen the same sentence under\n\na discretionary regime[,]” Silva had “no right . . . even to be present during such a\n\nlimited inquiry, and so by necessary implication . . . [authority] does not support a\n\nright to allocute therein.” Id. at 686. While the court acknowledged the federal\n\nrulemaking and case law authority establishing allocution as a general, necessary\n\ncomponent of a criminal defendant’s due process rights, see id. at 686-87, it further\n\nnoted, “[W]e have decided that allocution is not always necessary in the case of\n\nsentencing error.” Id. at 687. The court illustrated the limits of the allocution right\n\nby harkening to its earlier opinion in United States v. Knows His Gun, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793411\"><a href=\"/opinion/793411/united-states-v-sylvester-norman-knows-his-gun-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(9th Cir. 2006). In Knows His Gun, the Ninth Circuit affirmed a sentence where the\n\ntrial court, on remand in light of Booker, failed to permit allocution. Id. at 920.\n\nRecounted later in Silva, the Ninth Circuit noted that the key factor was Knows His\n                                        -39-\n\f#26764\n\nGun’s ability at his original sentencing to present all relevant evidence and to\n\nallocute. See Silva, 472 F.3d at 687 (citing Knows His Gun, 438 F.3d at 919-20)\n\n(“We affirmed . . . because the defendant had already had a chance to present non-\n\nGuidelines evidence at the original sentencing and needed no further right to\n\nallocute.”). The court then applied that rationale to Silva, and held that because the\n\nlimited remand “merely requires review of the record and the views of counsel, due\n\nprocess does not require allocution.” Id. at 687-88.\n\n[¶60.]       The clear parallels between Berget’s case and Silva indicate that the\n\ndue process afforded to Berget on limited remand did not implicate Berget’s right to\n\nallocution. Like the Ninth Circuit’s directive in Silva, we instructed on remand that\n\nthe circuit court was to conduct its review “on the existing record.” See Berget I,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 120, 826 N.W.2d at 37. Akin to Silva, we effectively tasked the lower\n\ncourt with making “a subjective determination, based upon a review of the record\n\nand the submissions of counsel, as to whether [Berget’s] sentence would have been\n\n[] different” absent the improper consideration. See Silva, 472 F.3d at 685. The\n\ncircuit court then appropriately considered only the existing record, including the\n\nprior allocution, and the views of counsel in making its decision. The circuit court\n\nwas not required to grant additional allocution because Berget was already given a\n\nchance to submit all relevant evidence and to allocute at his sentencing hearing.\n\nSilva provides that no due process right to allocute exists within the limited remand\n\nframework we instructed in Berget I given the similarities of our instructions. This,\n\ncoupled with SDCL 23A-27-1’s plain language does not support Berget’s\n\ninterpretation. Berget offers no persuasive authority on which to base his\n\nallocution right.\n                                         -40-\n\f#26764\n\n[¶61.]       Further, even if there were a right of allocution in this instance, any\n\nfailure of the circuit court to provide Berget this right was harmless error. See\n\nUnited States v. Robertson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1451755\"><a href=\"/opinion/1451755/united-states-v-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">859</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 863 & n.3 (8th Cir. 2008) (applying\n\nharmless error analysis to an allocution error). Recognizing the similar nature of\n\nthe right to be present and the right to allocute (albeit the allocution right involves\n\na lesser, common law concern), see Silva, 472 F.3d at 686, a similar harmless error\n\nframework may be applied. This Court’s instruction on remand narrowed the\n\ncircuit court’s consideration of new mitigating evidence. By this instruction,\n\nBerget’s ability to re-allocute, after electing not to introduce Dr. Bean’s testimony,\n\nbecame immaterial. With the removal of Dr. Bean’s report from consideration, the\n\nevidence upon which Berget could allocute was the same evidence upon which he\n\nallocuted at the initial sentencing hearing. Nothing changed. And because the\n\nresentencing court indicated it would consider his prior allocution, Berget could not\n\nhave influenced the circuit court’s resentencing decision when all the court had to\n\nconsider was the preexisting record. Cf. Kost, 344 N.W.2d at 86 (“[Defendant’s]\n\nabsence from these discussions was not error because his presence was not\n\nnecessary to defend against the charges.”). As noted above, the language of SDCL\n\n23A-37-1 does not provide a right of allocution at this limited resentencing, and\n\neven if it did, the resulting error at Berget’s resentencing would be harmless beyond\n\na reasonable doubt because it could not, and would not, contribute to the sentence\n\nrendered. See Larson, 512 N.W.2d at 735.\n\n[¶62.]        Therefore, Berget provides no persuasive authority to support a right\n\nto allocution in the limited remand proceedings directed by Berget I. If the court\n\n\n                                          -41-\n\f#26764\n\nerred in not providing for allocution, that error was harmless. Accordingly, his\n\nclaim fails.\n\n[¶63.]         3.    Whether the circuit court erred in not recusing itself\n                     prior to resentencing.\n\n[¶64.]         Berget asserts the circuit court erred by denying his request that the\n\ncourt recuse itself on limited remand, citing the court’s actual and implied judicial\n\nbias. This argument stems from Berget’s allegation that the court simply recycled\n\nits findings of fact and conclusions of law from those in the case of Berget’s co-\n\ndefendant, Eric Robert. In his initial brief, Berget characterized this allegation as\n\nindicating the court gave his case little consideration, which in turn evidenced bias.\n\nBerget now modifies this argument in his reply brief and in oral argument by\n\nasserting that the court was “trying to be fair in a situation where no mortal could\n\nbe.” Berget further explains that the court was more inherently—rather than\n\nintentionally—biased because it had to prejudge Berget’s case, having already\n\nsentenced his co-defendant on similar findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n\nBerget relates that for the court to change its findings from Robert’s case to Berget’s\n\ncase would be to “call the finality of the [Robert] decision . . . into question.”\n\n[¶65.]         Berget admits that SDCL 15-12-24 statutorily precluded his affidavit\n\nfor change of judge because he submitted argument to the circuit court—admitting\n\nguilt and receiving sentence—prior to filing the affidavit. He bases the court’s duty\n\nto recuse on a superseding, general constitutional right to a fair trial, citing Nelson,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 14, 587 N.W.2d at 445 (citations omitted) (outlining the scope of a\n\nright to a fair trial), and Page, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 14, 709 N.W.2d at 749 (quoting State\n\nv.

Berget had argued on direct appeal that\n\nsimilarities between the verdicts from his and Robert’s pre-sentencing hearing\n\nindicate a violation of Berget’s right to an individualized sentencing determination\n\nunder Lockett.

This Court\n\nrejected that argument. We did so based on our finding that “Berget has not\n\n‘presented any evidence to constitute a legitimate basis on which to call into\n\nquestion the circuit judge’s impartiality. . . . Absent such a showing that a fair\n\njudgment was impossible, it was not error for the circuit judge to sentence [Berget]\n\nafter sentencing his co-defendant [Robert].’” Id. ¶ 54, 826 N.W.2d at 18 (quoting\n\nPage, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 17, 709 N.W. 2d at 751). 16 This finding echoed our prior\n\nholdings in Page, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 15-17, 709 N.W.2d at 750-51, and Hoadley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 32-34, 651 N.W.2d at 257-58, that the mere fact the circuit court\n\npreviously sentenced a co-defendant to death does not show the judicial bias, or the\n\n“deep-seated favoritism or antagonism,” that overrides the presumption against\n\nrecusal that the court was impartial. Berget’s attempt to distinguish this case from\n\nPage and Hoadley fails. To accept Berget’s argument would prohibit the trying of\n\nco-defendants by the same judge in all cases as a matter of law. Berget offers no\n\n\n\n\n16.      Rather, we explained that the similarity in the presentence verdicts’\n         recitation of facts was the logical and proper result of a court approaching a\n         joint murder by co-defendants.

This argument\n\ntherefore fails.\n\n[¶67.]        4.    Whether Berget’s sentence was imposed under the\n                    influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\n                    factor.\n\n[¶68.]        Our analysis of the record indicates no basis for finding Berget’s\n\nsentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other\n\narbitrary factor. See SDCL 23A-27A-12(1). The circuit court’s amended\n\npresentence hearing verdict and amended findings of fact and conclusions of law\n\nreflect the proper scope of analysis directed by this Court on limited remand. As\n\nindicated above, Berget’s assertion of circuit court bias, actual and inherent, was\n\nshown to have no merit on direct appeal and remains without merit. Berget I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 54, 826 N.W.2d at 18-19.

That continues to be the case here.\n\n[¶69.]        5.    Whether the evidence supports the circuit court’s finding\n                    of statutory aggravating circumstances as enumerated in\n                    SDCL 23A-27A-1.\n\n[¶70.]        We noted in Berget I that evidence introduced at Berget’s sentencing\n\nhearing supported, beyond a reasonable doubt, the circuit court’s finding of two\n\nstatutory aggravating circumstances evident in Ronald Johnson’s murder. See id.\n\n¶¶ 16-17, 826 N.W.2d at 11; see also SDCL 23A-27A-1(7) (“The offense was\n\ncommitted against a law enforcement officer, employee of a corrections institution,\n\nor firefighter while engaged in the performance of such person’s official duties[.]”);\n\n23A-27A-1(8) (“The offense was committed by a person in, or who has escaped from,\n\nthe lawful custody of a law enforcement officer or place of lawful confinement[.]”).\n                                        -44-\n\f#26764\n\nSince then, Berget has brought forth no evidence or argument to question those\n\nholdings. Further inquiry is therefore unnecessary. The evidence supports the\n\ncircuit court’s finding of the two statutory aggravating circumstances.\n\n[¶71.]       6.     Whether Berget’s death sentence is excessive or\n                    disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\n                    considering both the crime and the defendant.\n\n[¶72.]       Finally, because “[w]e strictly and purposely limited our remand\n\ninstructions in [Berget I] to correct the specific error that had occurred,” see Piper\n\nIII, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 12, 842 N.W.2d at 343, and because Berget acknowledges without\n\nobjection that all proportionality concerns raised in Berget I were addressed and\n\naffirmed by our opinion, our prior proportionality analysis stands, see Berget I, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2013</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 18-31, 826 N.W.2d at 11-14. The record continues to provide no basis for\n\nthis Court to find Berget’s death sentence to be excessive or disproportionate. In\n\nthe absence of the Court’s instruction, the aggravating circumstances of Berget’s\n\ncrime and the remaining aggravating factors would nevertheless outweigh any\n\nreasonable implications of Berget’s new relationship—no matter how positive—with\n\nhis son and his son’s family. We conclude that our prior proportionality analysis\n\nremains valid and Berget’s death sentence is not excessive or disproportionate in\n\nrelation to similar cases where the death penalty was imposed.\n\n                                      Conclusion\n\n[¶73.]       This Court, pursuant to the South Dakota Constitution, possesses the\n\nclear authority to direct the jurisdictional scope of a limited remand to the circuit\n\ncourt, and our remand directions in Berget I did not infringe upon any of Berget’s\n\nconstitutional rights. The limited remand also did not implicate or otherwise\n\nviolate Berget’s rights to be present and to allocution. Finally, this Court previously\n                                         -45-\n\f#26764\n\nrejected, in Berget I, Berget’s judicial bias argument, and he has provided no\n\nadditional, substantive argument in that regard on this appeal. We therefore affirm\n\nhis death sentence.\n\n[¶74.]       ZINTER and SEVERSON, Justices, and MILLER, Retired Justice,\n\nconcur.\n\n[¶75.]       KONENKAMP, Justice, dissents.\n\n[¶76.]       MILLER, Retired Justice, sitting for WILBUR, Justice, disqualified.\n\n\n\nKONENKAMP, Justice (dissenting on Issue 1).\n\n[¶77.]       When a death sentence is reversed and remanded for resentencing,\n\nand the sentencing court is thus required to determine anew whether to impose a\n\nsentence of life or death, there is no rational basis to deny the defendant the\n\nopportunity to present for the court’s deliberation any newly available mitigation\n\nevidence. It makes no difference here whether our remand was limited. The\n\nsentencing court was ordered to “conduct a sentencing without” the error in the\n\nprevious sentencing, and therefore, it had to reevaluate all the appropriate factors\n\nand evidence, absent the erroneously considered matter. Federal constitutional law\n\nand our own jurisprudence require that the sentencing court consider any new\n\nmitigation evidence.\n\n                                           I.\n\n[¶78.]       Death is the ultimate penalty. It cannot be undone. It is thus an\n\n“‘indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death’” that the\n\nsentencing process “permit the consideration of the ‘character and record of the\n\nindividual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense[.]’” Lockett v.\n                                       -46-\n\f#26764\n\nOhio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 601, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109935\"><a href=\"/opinion/109935/lockett-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Yet, after today’s decision, courts will be required to ignore any\n\ncurrent mitigation evidence in deciding life or death if that court is resentencing an\n\noffender because of an error in the previous sentencing process. This limitation\n\n“creates the risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which\n\nmay call for a less severe penalty[,]” a risk “unacceptable and incompatible with the\n\ncommands of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.” See Lockett, 438 U.S. at\n\n605, 98 S. Ct. at 2965. Our Court ignores the fundamental tenets of the Eighth\n\nAmendment in holding, as a matter of law, that a defendant sentenced to death has\n\nno right to present newly discovered, otherwise admissible, mitigating evidence\n\nwhen resentenced, because that defendant had an opportunity to present mitigation\n\nevidence at the original sentencing hearing.\n\n[¶79.]         A right to mitigate one’s sentence in a capital case is not merely a\n\nstatutory right, but a constitutional guarantee.

Despite this Court’s claim, Guzek is not “instructive in a broader sense.” See\n         supra Majority Opinion ¶ 44. Guzek ruled that a defendant is not entitled to\n         present new evidence of his innocence during a sentencing hearing because\n         the guilt and sentencing phases are different, the issue of guilt had already\n         been litigated, and trial management and evidentiary considerations control.\n         546 U.S. at 526-27, 126 S. Ct. at 1232-33. Here, however, Berget’s attempt to\n         introduce new mitigation evidence at sentencing in no way implicates the\n                                                              (continued . . .)\n                                            -47-\n\f#26764\n\nto decide “a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be\n\ntaken or spared,” see Gregg, 428 U.S. at 189, 96 S.

We reversed Bult’s\n\nsentence specifically because the sentencing court failed to consider Bult’s current\n\nmitigation evidence, despite the fact that Bult had an error-free original sentencing\n\nhearing ten years earlier.

Bult III, 529 N.W.2d at 199. On appeal for the third time, we\n\nreversed the sentence and “remand[ed] again for resentencing, with instructions\n\n18.      The Court’s concern here about the “negative consequences” of allowing\n         newly available mitigation evidence at resentencing was adequately\n         answered by the Idaho Supreme Court in Sivak: “Needless to say, a\n         sentencing judge will not have to consider such post-sentence mitigation\n         evidence as will be submitted in this case if [the judge] conducts a proper\n         sentencing procedure in the first place.” Id. at 198 n.3.\n\n                                           -49-\n\f#26764\n\nthat the sentencing court shall impose an appropriate term of years.” Id. at 200.\n\nWe did not specifically instruct the court to conduct a full sentencing hearing. Id.\n\nYet, when, on remand, the sentencing court did not hold a new evidentiary hearing\n\nand sentenced Bult to 300 years, Bult appealed asserting that his 300-year sentence\n\nconstituted cruel and unusual punishment and that he was denied a meaningful\n\nsentencing hearing. Bult IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 6-7, 544 N.W.2d at 216.\n\n[¶83.]       On appeal, we held that a sentencing court had an “obligation,” on\n\nremand for resentencing, to update itself on what actions the defendant had taken\n\nbetween the reversal of the court’s resentence and the court’s second rehearing to\n\npronounce a new sentence. Id. ¶ 12. We did not rely on the “nature of the error,” or\n\nlanguage from Bult III that “permitted a full sentencing hearing on remand[.]” See\n\nsupra Majority Opinion n.9. We also did not express concern for maintaining\n\n“judicial efficiency” and avoiding “arbitrary outcomes.” Rather, we focused on the\n\nsentencing court’s duty to thoroughly acquaint itself with the current character and\n\nhistory of the defendant before it.\n\n                                         III.\n\n[¶84.]       “Sentencing decisions are perhaps the most difficult responsibility for\n\ntrial judges, encompassing circumstances both obvious and elusive.” State v.\n\nBonner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 11, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"900338\"><a href=\"/opinion/900338/state-v-bonner/\"><span class=\"volume\">577</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578. The task becomes even more\n\ndifficult when we declare, as a matter of law, that trial courts must cull out previous\n\nportions of their deliberations on resentencing, but cannot consider current\n\nmitigation that may bear on the question of life or death. Because resentencing\n\nrequires courts to reevaluate and reweigh the factors that went into their initial\n\ndecision, they should also consider any new evidence that the defendant has\n                                         -50-\n\f#26764\n\ndeveloped since the initial sentencing hearing. Doing otherwise infringes on Eighth\n\nAmendment protections and violates our own established jurisprudence.\n\n[¶85.]       Berget’s sentence should be remanded for a new sentencing hearing.\n\nThis result is the only one consistent with our precedent and “ensure[s] the\n\nreliability, under Eighth Amendment standards, of the determination that ‘death is\n\nthe appropriate punishment in a specific case.’” See Lockett, 438 U.S. at 601, 98 S.\n\nCt. at 2963 (quoting Woodson, 428 U.S. at 305, 96 S.
