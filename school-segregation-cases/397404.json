Appellants claim that these two districts were racially\n\ngerrymandered in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States\n\nConstitution. After a bench trial, the district court granted judgment to Putnam\n\nCounty. This appeal followed.\n\n                                               I.\n\n       In 1981, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia\n\ninvalidated at-large elections in Putnam County, Georgia (the “County”),\n\n\n\n______________________\n*Honorable Donald P. Lay. U.S. Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                               2\n\fconcluding that this electoral system had been created and maintained with the\n\ninvidious discriminatory purpose of limiting black voters’ meaningful participation\n\nin the electoral process in violation of their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment\n\nrights under the United States Constitution. Bailey v. Vining, 514 F. Supp. 452,\n\n463 (M.D. Ga. 1981). The court ordered the creation of four electoral districts,1\n\nwith Districts 1 and 2 to be remedial majority-minority districts.2 District 1 was\n\nconstructed to have a black voting age population of 73.47%; District 2 to have\n\n54.84% black voters.3\n\n\n\n\n      1\n        There are two elective bodies in the County. The Board of Commissioners\nand the Board of Education each have one member from each of the four electoral\ndistricts. The chair of each board is elected at-large.\n      2\n       In a majority-minority electoral district, a majority of the voting age\npopulation is from the minority population. Upon a showing of invidious\ndiscriminatory purpose in electoral districting, a court is entitled to remedy the\nconstitutional violation by creating these majority-minority districts. Mobile v.\nBolden, 446 U.S. 55 (1980).\n      3\n        There is some minor disagreement in the record over these percentages. We\nhave adopted the figures included in the County’s submission to the Department of\nJustice in its Section 5 preclearance submission in 1982.\n                                          3\n\f      Over the next decade, however, the black population of Putnam County\n\ndeclined from over 40%, to just under 34%.4 This was attributable in large part to\n\na substantial influx of white residents, largely into District 4.5 The 1990 census\n\nrevealed that, as a result of these population shifts, the County’s four electoral\n\ndistricts had become seriously malapportioned. There was an overall deviation\n\nfrom equal district population of almost 75%.6 All concerned realized that the\n\ncounty’s electoral districts would have to be reapportioned to satisfy the\n\nconstitutional requirement of “one-person, one-vote.” Reynolds v. Simms, 377 U.S.\n\n533 (1964); Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 381 (1963); Hadley v. Junior College\n\nDist., 397 U.S. 50, 56-57 (1970) (extending Reynolds to school board districts);\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      The black voting age population declined farther still to 30.06% of the\ncounty’s population.\n      5\n       District 4 contains two lakes which have attracted many new residents.\n      6\n        Ideal population size of a district is the quotient of the population of a\ncounty divided by the number of its electoral districts. Overall deviation from this\nideal size is the sum of the percentage one district is underpopulated and the\npercentage another district is overpopulated. In 1990, Putnam County’s District 3\nhad a population 41.6% higher (plus 41.6%) than the ideal, and District 1 had a\npopulation 33% lower (minus 33%).\n                                           4\n\fAvery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 481-85 (1970) (county commissioner\n\ndistricts).7\n\n       The County hired Christopher Coates to assist it in the reapportionment\n\nprocess. He had represented the plaintiffs suing the County in Bailey v. Vining,\n\nwhich resulted in the court-ordered, remedial redistricting of 1981. Coates, along\n\nwith the County, consulted with Linda Meggers of the Georgia Reapportionment\n\nServices Office in Atlanta, an office established by the legislature to provide\n\ntechnical assistance to local governments engaged in redistricting. It was Ms.\n\nMeggers who, at the direction of the County, actually produced the 1992 plan.\n\n       The plan was approved by a majority vote of the County’s Board of\n\nCommissioners, and, pursuant to the Georgia Constitution, was presented to the\n\nlegislature for its approval. Regrettably, the legislature followed a course not\n\nunfamiliar to those observing state action in matters of this sort. In short, the\n\nlegislature walked away from the issue; defaulted its responsibility to deal with\n\nGeorgia election matters; and failed to take any action on the 1992\n\n\n\n\n       7\n       Reapportionment is required every ten years to ensure that electoral districts\ncontain approximately equal populations, thus ensuring one-person, one-vote, as\nthe Constitution requires. See Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 60.\n                                           5\n\freapportionment plan.8 The County, through Coates, took the plan to the district\n\njudge who, in Bailey v. Vining, had ordered the 1982 redistricting. The County\n\nasked the court to amend its 1981 judgment by adopting the 1992 plan.9 Although\n\nthe Bailey case had long been closed, the district court agreed and ordered the\n\nimplementation of the new plan on an “interim” basis, until the Georgia legislature\n\ncould adopt a constitutionally satisfactory reapportionment plan. Once the plan\n\nwas enacted, however, no further efforts for legislative approval were undertaken.10\n\n      The County did submit the plan to the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) for\n\nits approval. Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the County from\n\ninstituting any changes in its electoral laws until they have been “precleared” with\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       It may be said that in our nation of separation of powers, when the\nappropriate branch abdicates its responsibility, a vacuum in sovereignty results.\nLike nature, sovereignty abhors a vacuum, drawing an inappropriate branch, the\nfederal court, into the abandoned arena.\n      9\n      This was apparently accomplished informally since no Rule 60 motion to\namend the judgment, nor any other pleading, was filed.\n      10\n        We have been invited by appellants to hold that this highly unusual\nenactment procedure, in which Coates appears to have represented both sides of a\ncase in which there was no real controversy, was ultra vires. We decline to do so,\nhowever, since, absent statutory authorization, we are without jurisdiction to\ninvalidate an order entered in another civil case. Furthermore, appellants could\nhave, but failed, to challenge that order on direct appeal.\n                                          6\n\fthe DOJ.11 42 U.S. C. § 1973c (1994). To obtain preclearance, a covered\n\njurisdiction12 must convince the DOJ that the electoral change was not adopted for\n\nthe purpose of discriminating against protected minorities, nor will have that effect.\n\nThe DOJ approved the plan, and the County implemented it.\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         Under § 5, a covered jurisdiction must seek preclearance either by filing a\ndeclaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the District of\nColumbia, or by submitting the election law change to the United State Attorney\nGeneral for administrative preclearance. The Voting Section of the Civil Rights\nDivision of the DOJ is charged with administering preclearance on behalf of the\nAttorney General.\n      12\n         Jurisdictions covered by § 5 include those which in 1965 had substantial\nhistories of intentional disenfranchisement of black voters. As the Supreme Court\nexplained in Beer:\n       Section 5 was a response to a common practice in some jurisdictions\n       of staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing new\n       discriminatory voting laws as soon as the old ones had been stuck\n       down. That practice had been possible because each new law\n       remained in effect until the Justice Department or private plaintiffs\n       were able to sustain the burden of proving that the new law, too, was\n       discriminatory. . . . Congress therefore decided, as the Supreme Court\n       held it could, “to shift the advantage of time and inertia from the\n       perpetrators of the evil to its victim,” by “freezing election procedures\n       in the covered areas unless the changes can be shown to be\n       nondiscriminatory.”\n 425 U.S. at 140 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 94-196, pp. 57-58 (1975)) (footnotes\nomitted).\n                                          7\n\f       After this court-ordered redistricting,13 both of the County’s majority-\n\nminority districts were maintained and each had approximately 60% black voting\n\nage population, despite the significant decline in the overall black population of the\n\ncounty.14 Furthermore, over 90 % of the county’s black population was assigned to\n\nthese two districts. The County conducted its elections under this “interim” plan\n\nfor ten years.15\n\n       13\n         There is substantial dispute as to whether the plan enacted by the district\ncourt in 1992 constituted “court-ordered” redistricting, or “legislatively-drawn”\nredistricting. While it is true that the county drew the plan which the district court\nultimately ordered, it is also true that the Georgia legislature did not approve it,\nwhich left the plan null and void. Without court intervention, there would be no\n1992 reapportionment plan to challenge. The fact is, there has been no\nlegislatively-authorized redistricting plan in Putnam County for thirty years! We\nshall treat this plan as a court-ordered one, since it was.\n       14\n         District 1 had 61.83 % black voters, and District 2 had 59.59 %.\n       15\n        The constitutional status of this plan is not mooted by the 2000 census\ndata, and any redistricting thereunder, since, absent invalidation, the majority-\nminority electoral districts established by the 1992 plan will serve as the\nbenchmark for the 2000 redistricting. See Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 528\nU.S. 320, 327-28 (2000). See also Sanders v. Dooly County, 245 F.3d 1289, 1291-\n92 (11th Cir. 2001) (effect of holding prior plan unconstitutional is to “prevent the\nAttorney General from using the [prior] plan as a base line for retrogression\nanalysis in the post-2000 census round of preclearance proceedings under § 5 of\nthe Voting Right Act”) (citing Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Civil\nRights Division, Guidance concerning Redistricting and Retrogression Under\nSection 5 of the voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. 1973c, 66 Fed. Reg. 5412, 5413\n(January 18, 2001) (“Absent . . . a finding of unconstitutionality under Shaw by a\nfederal court, the last legally enforceable plan will serve as benchmark for Section\n5 review”).\n                                           8\n\f      In 1997, plaintiff-voters filed this action challenging the 1992 plan.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the County unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered its\n\nelectoral districts in 1992, by purposefully maximizing the black voter population\n\nin Districts 1 and 2.\n\n      The district court rejected this claim, holding that race did not predominate\n\nover traditional districting concerns in the construction of the 1992\n\nreapportionment plan. Furthermore, the court held that, even if race did\n\npredominate in the construction of the 1992 plan, the challenged districts were\n\nnarrowly tailored to meet the compelling state interest of remedying black vote\n\ndilution created by racial bloc voting. The court entered a judgment for the\n\nCounty.\n\n      “[I]ntentional discrimination is a finding of fact.” Anderson v. Bessemer\n\nCity, 470 U.S. 564, 573 (1985). Accordingly, we review the district court’s\n\nultimate finding that race did not predominate in the reapportionment process for\n\nclear error. Hunt v. Cromartie, 532 U.S. 234 (2001). We must affirm the district\n\ncourt’s finding unless we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that a\n\nmistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. We review de novo the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion of law that the 1992 plan serves a compelling state\n\ninterest. NAACP v. Duval County Sch. Bd., 273 F.3d 960 (2001).\n\n                                          9\n\f                                          II.\n\n      The central mandate of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States\n\nConstitution is “racial neutrality in governmental decision making.” Miller v.\n\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 904 (1995). Racial classifications are antithetical to the\n\nFourteenth Amendment, whose “central purpose” was “to eliminate racial\n\ndiscrimination emanating from official sources in the States.” McLaughlin v.\n\nFlorida, 379 U.S. 184, 192 (1964).\n\n      The Equal Protection Clause also requires, however, that no race be denied\n\nthe effective exercise of the right to vote. Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.S.\n\n544, 569 (1969) (“[t]he right to vote can be affected by a dilution of voting power\n\nas well as by an absolute prohibition on casting a ballot”) (emphasis in original).\n\nElectoral schemes which cancel out or dilute the voting strength of racial groups\n\nare unconstitutional when they are adopted with a discriminatory purpose. White v.\n\nRegester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973 ). In order to state a racial vote dilution claim under\n\nthe Constitution, intent to racially discriminate must be shown. Mobile v. Bolden,\n\n446 U.S. 55, 62 (1980). In 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965 to make unlawful any electoral practice which has even the unintentional\n\neffect of minority vote dilution. Amended § 2 provides:\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f       No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice,\n       or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political\n       subdivision to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United\n       States to vote on account of race or color.\n\n       A violation . . . is established if, based on the totality of\n       circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to\n       nomination or election . . . are not equally open to participation by\n       [minorities] in that [they] have less opportunity than other members of\n       the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n       representatives of their choice.\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1973b (1994).\n\n       Race, therefore, may be taken into consideration in avoiding and remedying\n\nunlawful vote dilution by devising voting districts which ensure that all voters have\n\nan equally effective opportunity to participate in the electoral process. Regester,\n\n412 U.S. at 769.\n\n       Race may not, however, be used as the primary tool in assigning voters to\n\nelectoral districts. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 642, 646 (1993). “Just as the State\n\nmay not, absent extraordinary justification, segregate citizens on the basis of race\n\nin its public parks, . . . it may not separate its citizens into different voting districts\n\non the basis of race.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 911(citations omitted). Traditional\n\ndistricting principles, such as protecting contiguity, compactness, incumbency and\n\ncommunities of interest may not be subordinated to race in the crafting of electoral\n\ndistricts. Shaw, 509 U.S. at 645. If race is shown to have predominated over these\n\n                                             11\n\ftraditional factors in the development of a redistricting plan, the Constitution\n\nrequires that we strictly scrutinize that plan to determine whether it is narrowly\n\ntailored to serve some compelling state interest. Id.; Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952,\n\n959 (1996) (citing Miller, 515 U.S. at 916). If it is not, it is unconstitutional.\n\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 911.\n\n                                           III.\n\n      The County does not deny that it set out to maintain its two majority black\n\nvoting districts, nor that it used race as a basis for assigning voters to those\n\ndistricts. This was not, however, the County’s only motive. The County was also\n\nconcerned with traditional districting criteria – especially incumbency – in\n\nreapportioning its electoral districts.16 The issue, then, is whether race\n\npredominated over these traditional considerations in the 1992 redistricting.\n\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 916. “The plaintiff’s burden is to show, either through\n\ncircumstantial evidence of a district’s shape and demographics or more direct\n\nevidence going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant factor\n\n\n\n\n      16\n         The County states in its brief that “the 1982 Plan was in fact preserved as\nmuch as possible and that the only changes made were for the purposes of\nbalancing the population in the districts, protecting incumbents, and preserving the\ndistricting principles that had been followed in the previous plan.”\n                                           12\n\fmotivating the legislature’s decision to place a significant number of voters within\n\nor without a particular district.” Id.\n\n1.    The Direct Evidence of Race-Based Apportionment\n\n      There is much in the record to indicate that racial considerations drove the\n\n1992 redistricting. The Chairman of the County Commission at the time, Harold\n\nDennis, testified that he told Coates that maintenance of the two majority black\n\nvoting districts was his and other Commissioners’ goal in the reapportionment\n\nprocess in order to ensure racial proportional representation on the County\n\nCommission and Board of Education. He testified that county officials instructed\n\nMs. Meggers “that two of the voting districts [should] have black general\n\npopulations and voter age populations as high as possible within the constraints of\n\na range of % deviation no greater than, generally, plus or minus five %” and “to\n\nmaximize the black voting strength in Districts One and Two.”\n\n      Ms. Meggers testified that “her predominant consideration in crafting the\n\nplan was to maintain the core of the existing majority minority districts and strive\n\ntoward a 60% black VAP [voting age population].” In order to achieve this\n\nbenchmark, the County instructed her to include “every contiguous census block\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\favailable which would have the effect of increasing the black percentage in the two\n\nmajority black voting districts.”17\n\n      Coates testified that the City of Eatonton was divided so as to maximize the\n\nblack population within Districts 1 and 2, while keeping as much of the white\n\npopulation as possible within District 3. Bill Moore, the current Chairman of the\n\nCounty Board of Commissioners, testified that the only reason behind District 4's\n\nboundary line placement was to include as many blacks within Districts 1 and 2 as\n\npossible and make each of these districts majority black. He testified that it was\n\n“common knowledge” that the “law” required this result.\n\n      These district lines enhanced the black voting strength in Districts 1 and 2,\n\ndespite the fact that the County had lost almost 8% of its black population between\n\nthe 1980 and the 1990 censuses. Coates testified that “we took the plan that\n\nexisted, we changed it to the extent of attempting to preserve the two majority\n\nblack districts. We were conscious about the race of the people in the districts in\n\ndoing that, and we assigned them so as to achieve the majority black districts.” He\n\n\n\n\n      17\n       This representation was made to the DOJ in the County’s § 5 preclearance\nsubmission.\n                                         14\n\ftestified that he believed that maintenance of the two districts was necessary in\n\norder to obtain approval of the plan by the DOJ.18\n\n      In fact, the County’s § 5 submission to the DOJ describes the\n\nreapportionment of Districts 1 and 2 in exclusively racial terms:\n\n             [We have] requested [of Ms. Meggers] that two of the four\n      voting districts have black general population and voting age\n      populations as high as possible within constraints of a range of %\n      deviation no greater than generally plus or minus five %. Moreover,\n      local officials requested that the available concentrations of black\n      population be distributed substantially equally between two of the\n      voting districts so that these districts would both be majority black.\n\n            This approach to redistricting was specifically employed . . .\n      because . . . of the fact that since 1982, two county commissions and\n      school board districts have been represented by black representatives\n      elected from majority black districts.\n\n            Quite simply, the submitted plan . . . creates two voting districts\n      in which black voting strength [in] Putnam County has been\n      maximized. Such maximization is readily apparent when it is\n      remembered that the submitted district voting plan provides for black\n      populations in excess of 60% in two of four voting districts in a\n      county which African-Americans constitute one-third of the\n      population. (Emphasis in original)\n\n\n      18\n         The view that the Voting Rights Act required as many minority controlled\ndistricts as physically possible was widely shared by state and county legislators at\nthe time. Butler, 36 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 141-42. According to Butler, this view\nwas justified because the Voting Section of the DOJ propagated a “maximization\nagenda,” see Miller, 515 U.S. at 917, and enforced it through its Section 5\npreclearance power. Id. In the early 1990's this led to the proliferation of electoral\ndistricts with “bizarre” shapes designed to aggregate minority populations. This\ncontinued until the Supreme Court in Shaw condemned this “racial assignment” of\nvoters. 509 U.S. 630.\n                                          15\n\f      That race predominated in the 1992 redistricting is also evidenced by the\n\nletter the County directed its lawyer to send to the Baily district court in 1993\n\nfollowing the Supreme Court’s rejection of race-based districting in Shaw. In that\n\nletter, the County’s attorney sought the district court’s advice about the continued\n\nconstitutionality of the districts in Putnam County since they “were established\n\nalong racial lines.”\n\n2.    Circumstantial Evidence\n\n      The 1992 plan assigns 90% of the black population to two districts, each of\n\nwhich contains approximately 60% black voters, in a county which contains only\n\n34% black residents. These percentages were obtained by the deliberate\n\nmanipulation of district lines to maximize the number of black voters in the two\n\nchallenged districts.19 Ms. Meggers testified that the decline in the black\n\npopulation in the county made the maintenance of racial hegemony in Districts 1\n\nand 2 a “challenge;” she was ultimately able to do so only by utilizing the\n\nredistricting “tool” of keeping the majority black districts at a “negative population\n\ndeviation,” i.e., an undercount. By deliberately choosing to underpopulate the two\n\n\n      19\n         Although neither District 1 nor District 2 have an excessively bizarre\nshape, Miller made clear that “parties alleging that a State has assigned voters on\nthe basis of race are neither confined in their proof to evidence regarding the\ndistrict’s geometry and makeup nor required to made a threshold showing of\nbizarreness.” 515 U.S. at 915. Shape must be considered in conjunction with\nracial and population densities. Id. at 917.\n                                          16\n\fmajority black districts, she was able to achieve the county’s goal of at least 60 %\n\nblack voting age population within them.\n\n      Ms. Meggers testified that when she did have to add voters to Districts 1 or\n\n2, she was careful to do so in a way that would avoid upsetting her 60% black voter\n\ngoal. For example, after some initial population shifting, District 2 was still\n\nsignificantly underpopulated, resulting in too great an overall deviation from equal\n\ndistrict population. To reduce this deviation, she testified that she reached out into\n\nthe far north of District 2 to capture a group of voters because they were equally\n\ndivided racially. She chose this racially balanced group because shifting them\n\nfrom District 3 to District 2 would help balance the districts’ populations without\n\ndoing any “harm to my numbers.” The parties refer to this area which protrudes\n\nnorth into District 3 as the “feather.” A by-product of the creation of the feather,\n\nwas the creation of a “land bridge” connecting the two parts of District 3 which\n\nwere virtually bisected by District 2's feather.\n\n      Similar byproducts of Ms. Meggers’ redistricting were the “smokestack” and\n\nthe “pie slice.” The smokestack, like the feather, was a protrusion into District 3 to\n\npick up voters who would help populate District 2 without upsetting the racial\n\ngoals. The pie slice is an area cut out of District 2, shaped like a piece of pie, to\n\nexclude white voters from District 2. In each of these cases, Ms. Meggers testified\n\n\n\n                                           17\n\fthat these unnatural shapes were the result of a deliberate attempt to maintain and\n\nmaximize the strength in the black voting districts.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n         We do not lightly reverse a district court’s findings of fact. Nevertheless, in\n\nview of the record before us, we are “left with the definite and firm conviction that\n\na mistake has been committed.” Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573. Contrary to\n\neverything said by the County during the plan’s creation and implementation, and\n\nthe uncontroverted, solemn representations made by it to the Department of\n\nJustice, upon which the plan received § 5 preclearance, the district court found that\n\nrace did not predominate over traditional factors in the 1992 plan. This was clearly\n\nerror.\n\n         In order to reach its conclusion, the district court had to do two things. First,\n\nit had to ignore the extensive testimony from all involved that race was the primary\n\nfocus of the redistricting process. Second, it had to totally discount the County’s\n\nown assertions, indeed admissions, in its § 5 submission to the DOJ that race was\n\nthe paramount consideration in the redistricting process. Neither of these courses\n\nof action was justified.\n\n1)       Race Predominated Over Traditional Districting Factors\n\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f      The district court did not cite any of the extensive testimony from the county\n\ncommissioners, Coates and Ms. Meggers that make it clear that, although\n\nmalapportionment was the “why” of the redistricting plan, race was the “how.” All\n\nof this testimony conceded that when decisions had to be made on how to shift\n\npopulation from one district to another, racial considerations dominated. The\n\ntestimony was overwhelming that no shift was made that would have “done\n\ndamage” to Ms. Meggers goal of 60% black voting age population in Districts 1\n\nand 2. In view of this record, even the district court conceded that “it is virtually\n\nbeyond dispute . . . that the County intended to maintain these districts as majority-\n\nminority districts in 1992.”\n\n      Nevertheless, the court concluded that race did not predominate over\n\ntraditional districting principles, because it found that the County’s four electoral\n\ndistricts are relatively compact, adhere to natural boundaries, preserve communities\n\nof interest, and protect incumbents. We disagree.\n\n      The “mere recitation” that traditional factors were not subordinated to race is\n\ninsufficient to insulate the County’s decision to maximize the black populations of\n\nDistricts 1 and 2. Miller, 515 U.S. at 919. The County’s contention that traditional\n\nfactors were not subordinated to race is not supported by the record. The evidence\n\nis overwhelming that the County decided at the outset to maintain its two black\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\fvoting districts and to assign as much of the black voting age population as\n\npossible to those districts. This agenda was never seriously questioned until after\n\nthe Supreme Court’s 1992 decision in Shaw which prompted the County to inquire\n\nof the district court concerning the constitutionality of its two race-based districts.\n\nSee Vera, 517 U.S. at 961.\n\n       The fact that other considerations may have played a role in the County’s\n\nredistricting does not mean that race did not predominate. Race may be shown to\n\nhave predominated even if, as here:\n\n       factors other than race are shown to have played a significant role in\n       the precise location and shape of those districts. If the line-drawing\n       process is shown to have been infected by such a deliberate racial\n       purpose, strict scrutiny cannot be avoided simply by demonstrating\n       that the shape and location of the districts can rationally be explained\n       by reference to some districting principle other than race, for the\n       intentional classification of voters by race, though perhaps disguised,\n       is still likely to reflect the “impermissible racial stereotypes,”\n       “illegitimate notions of racial inferiority” and “simple racial politics”\n       that strict scrutiny is designed to “smoke out.”\n\nShaw v. Hunt, 861 F. Supp. 408, 431 (E.D.N.C. 1994), rev’d on other grounds, 517\n\nU.S. 899 (1996). We look now to the role played in the 1992 redistricting by each\n\nof the traditional factors.\n\n       1.     Shape\n\n       Putnam County’s four electoral districts are relatively compact. The district\n\ncourt concluded that this fact militated against a finding that race predominated\n\n\n                                           20\n\fover this traditional districting factor. The Supreme Court, however, has rejected\n\nthis conclusion. Miller instructs that “bizarreness” of shape is not a threshold\n\nshowing for racial gerrymandering.20 515 U.S. at 915. Shape must be considered\n\nin conjunction with racial and population densities, id. at 917, and in this case\n\nthose factors militate against a finding that compactness trumped race when it\n\ncame to reapportioning the districts.\n\n      Intentionally, over 90% of the county’s black population was assigned to\n\neither District 1 or 2. The “feather,” smokestack,” and “pie slice” all indicate that\n\nwhen Ms. Meggers was looking for population to shift to bring her “deviation” into\n\nconstitutional range, race determined who should be shifted. The fact that the\n\nresulting irregularities in natural boundaries are small does not undermine the\n\ninevitable conclusion that they are there at all precisely because their racial\n\ncomposition helped achieve the plan’s racial goals. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 917\n\n(such deliberate racial line-drawing supports a finding that race predominated in\n\nthe redistricting process).\n\n\n\n\n      20\n          “Shape is relevant not because it is an element of the constitutional wrong\nor a threshold requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive\ncircumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting\nprinciples, was the legislature’s dominant and controlling rationale in drawing the\ndistrict lines.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 913.\n                                          21\n\f      Race not only determined who was shifted in the 1992 redistricting process;\n\neven more importantly, it also determined who was not. Ms. Meggers could have\n\nreduced her almost 11% deviation from equal district population by shifting voters\n\nfrom the overpopulated “white” districts into the underpopulated contiguous\n\n“black” districts. She chose not to, however, because to do so would have done\n\n“harm” to her [racial] “numbers.” As a result, the County, which undertook the\n\n1992 redistricting to correct malapportionment, remains significantly\n\nmalapportioned. The County’s commitment to the constitutional mandate of one-\n\nperson, one-vote was secondary to its primary racial agenda. This the Constitution\n\ndoes not permit. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 568; Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642; Miller, 515\n\nU.S. at 913.\n\n      2.       Communities of Interest\n\n      The district court also concluded that the plan elevated communities of\n\ninterest over race in the redistricting process. It offered this explanation for\n\nDistrict 3's “pie slice” which pulls population out of District 2 and places them into\n\nDistrict 3. The district court approved the inclusion of the pie slice in District 3\n\nbecause it is “characterized by fine, old houses and populated by a predominately\n\naffluent population, in contrast to the humbler conditions in the urban areas of\n\nDistrict Two.” The court concluded that, without the pie slice, there would have\n\nbeen an “unnatural division of this distinct community of interest.” Even if\n\n                                           22\n\fassignment of voters on the basis of socio-economic status is a legitimate,\n\ntraditional districting principle, which appears unlikely, nothing in the record\n\nsuggests that this was the reason for carving the pie slice out of District 2. On the\n\nother hand, the census tracts make clear that the population in the pie slice was\n\nlargely white and would have done “damage” to Ms. Meggers’ “numbers.”\n\n      3.     Incumbency\n\n      Finally, the district court accepted the County’s and Ms. Meggers’\n\ncontention that incumbency was, in fact, the primary consideration in the\n\nreapportionment process. While it is undoubtedly true that the County was\n\ninterested in protecting incumbents, it is clear that “racially motivated\n\ngerrymandering had a qualitatively greater influence on the drawing of district\n\nlines than politically motivated gerrymandering, and that political gerrymandering\n\nwas accomplished in large part by the use of race as a proxy.” Vera, 517 U.S. at\n\n969. The County sought to protect its two black incumbents by maximizing the\n\nblack population in their districts.21 Incumbency protection achieved by using race\n\nas a proxy is evidence of racial gerrymandering. Id. at 970. Furthermore, it is\n\n\n\n      21\n        While the boundaries of Districts 1 and 2 follow many precinct lines, this\nis because Ms. Meggers designed these districts along racial lines, and race data\nwas accessible to her at the precinct level. See Miller, 515 U.S. at 919 (striking\ndown as racially gerrymandered Ms. Meggers’ redistricting plan of the Georgia\ncongressional districts).\n                                          23\n\findicative of the sort of racial stereotyping that the Supreme Court has condemned\n\nas resembling political apartheid:\n\n      It reinforces the perception that members of the same racial group –\n      regardless of their age, education, economic status, or the community\n      in which they live – think alike, share the same political interests, and\n      will prefer the same candidates at the polls. We have rejected such\n      perceptions elsewhere as impermissible racial stereotypes.\n\n      ***\n\n      By perpetuating such notions, a racial gerrymander may exacerbate\n      the very patterns of racial block voting that majority-minority\n      districting is sometimes said to counteract.\n\nShaw, 509 U.S. at 647 (citing Holland v. Illinois, 493 U.S. 474, 484 n.2 (1990)).\n\n      Thus, we conclude that the district court’s finding that traditional districting\n\nfactors were not subordinated to racial considerations was clear error.\n\nB.    The County’s § 5 Preclearance Admissions\n\n      In order to uphold the plan, the district court also had to discount the\n\nCounty’s own clear admissions in its § 5 preclearance application that race\n\npredominated in the 1992 redistricting. The court did so by finding that these\n\n“representations” were made in an effort to persuade the DOJ that the plan was not\n\nretrogressive, and were, therefore, essentially “puffing.”\n\n      The Supreme Court, itself, however, has consistently looked to statements in\n\n§ 5 preclearance applications as evidentiary “admissions” sufficient to support a\n\nfinding that race predominated over traditional districting principles. In Shaw, the\n\n                                          24\n\fCourt observed that North Carolina’s § 5 submission, which expressly\n\nacknowledged that the state’s overriding purpose in redistricing was to create two\n\ncongressional districts with effective black voting majorities, was “direct evidence\n\nof the legislature’s objective.” 517 U.S. at 906.\n\n      Similarly, in Vera, the Court affirmed the Texas district court’s\n\ndetermination that several of Texas’ congressional districts had been racially\n\ngerrymandered based upon the district court’s “reliance on the State’s own\n\nstatements [in its § 5 submission] indicating the importance of race.” 517 U.S. at\n\n970. Thus, we do not believe that the district court’s dismissal of the County’s\n\nown clear admission that race predominated in this process was warranted.22\n\n      We conclude that the district court erred when it concluded that race was not\n\nthe County’s paramount concern in the 1992 redistricting. Accordingly, the plan\n\nmust be strictly scrutinized to determine whether the County has demonstrated that\n\nthese districts were narrowly tailored to satisfy some compelling state interest.\n\nShaw, 509 U.S. at 645.\n\n                                         V.\n\n\n\n\n      22\n        In fact, the doctrine of judicial estoppel would appear to affirmatively\nprohibit the County in this proceeding from contradicting its previous declarations\nmade in its § 5 submission.\n                                          25\n\f      To withstand strict scrutiny, the County must demonstrate that its 1992 race-\n\nbased redistricting plan serves some compelling interest. Miller, 515 U.S. at 920.\n\nFurthermore, the plan must have been narrowly tailored to achieve this interest. Id.\n\nA.    The County’s Compelling Interest\n\n      The district court held that, if the 1992 plan was race-based, it was justified\n\nby both the need to remedy past unlawful discrimination,23 and to avoid\n\nretrogression in violation of § 5 of the Voting Rights Act.24 There are several\n\nreasons why we reject this conclusion.\n\n      II     No Evidentiary Basis for Remedial Districting\n\n      Although there is a “significant state interest in eradicating the effects of\n\npast racial discrimination,” Shaw, 509 U.S. at 656, there is no evidence in this\n\nrecord of the need for remedial districting. There is none because the district court\n\nspecifically excluded this evidence. Intervenors, the NAACP and several\n\nindividual voters, urged the district court to hear evidence of racially polarized\n\n\n\n      23\n         The district court concluded that “the 1992 plan withstands strict scrutiny\nin that it was reasonably drawn to further a compelling governmental interest in\nremedying the effects of past racial discrimination.”\n      24\n         The district court held that “[j]ust as the creation of the majority-black\ndistricts in Judge Owners’ 1982 remedial order was narrowly tailored to remedy\npast discrimination, the maintenance of those districts in 1992 was narrowly\ntailored to continue that remedy and comply with the requirements of the Voting\nRights Act.”\n                                          26\n\fvoting in Putnam County. They argued that this evidence was necessary to meet\n\nthe strict scrutiny test, i.e., establish a compelling state interest.\n\n       The district court refused, noting that it was undisputed that the 1992\n\nredistricting plan was developed as the result of malapportionment, the unequal\n\ndistribution of people across district lines. Therefore, the 1992 redistricting plan\n\nwas simply a reapportionment plan, and not a remedial plan developed as the\n\nresult of a finding of § 2 liability.\n\n       Nor could it have been. The County already had two majority-minority\n\ndistricts, each consistently electing minority candidates, and there was no showing\n\nwhatsoever that, in 1992, there was any need to remedy any minority vote dilution\n\nwithin these districts. In fact, the minority voters in these districts were already\n\nover-represented as the result of the underpopulation of these districts in relation to\n\nDistricts 3 and 4. Thus, in this case, the district court correctly refused to hear\n\nevidence of that the 1992 plan was adopted to remedy minority vote dilution.\n\n       Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the 1992 plan is justifiable as\n\na remedy for past unlawful discrimination. It based this conclusion on the\n\ndemonstration of § 2 liability – vote dilution and racial bloc voting – which\n\nunderlay the court-ordered 1982 plan.\n\n       This was error. The need for a race-based remedy in 1992 cannot be\n\nestablished by reliance on a 1982 wrong that has already been remedied. Wygant\n\n                                             27\n\fv. Jackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 277 (1986) (plurality opinion) (under strict\n\nscrutiny, State must have convincing evidence that remedial action is necessary\n\nbefore implementing affirmative action). Nor can the court rely on some\n\n“generalized assertion of past discrimination” to justify a race-based remedy.\n\nShaw v. Hunt (Shaw II), 517 U.S. 899, 909 (1996). In order to rise to the level of a\n\ncompelling interest, the alleged discrimination must be identified with “some\n\nspecificity” and there must be a “strong basis in evidence” before a court may\n\norder a race-based remedy. Id. at 910 (quoting Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277). Since\n\nthere is no evidence in this record of an unremedied discriminatory purpose or\n\neffect in the County’s electoral districting, the district court erred when it held that\n\nCounty had a compelling interest in remedying such discrimination.25\n\n      2.     Non-retrogression as a Compelling State Interest\n\n\n\n\n      25\n         The 1982 plan itself was “ameliorative.” Court-ordered, in response to a\nfinding of § 2 liability, the 1982 plan instituted the four electoral districts, two of\nwhich were majority-minority. As a matter of law, this plan was not a statutory\nviolation. Shaw II, 517 U.S. at 912 (ameliorative plan cannot violate § 5 even if it\nfall short of what might be accomplished in terms of increasing minority\nrepresentation unless it is constitutionally flawed) (citing Miller, 515 U.S. at 923-\n24 (Georgia’s racially gerrymandered congressional district not required because\nthere was no reasonable basis to believe that earlier enacted plan violated § 2)). As\nthe 1982 plan was still effectively in place, there was no § 2 violation to remedy.\n“On its face, § 2 does not apply to a court-ordered remedial redistricting plan.”\nAbrams, 521 U.S. at 90.\n                                           28\n\f      The Supreme Court has consistently held that the purpose of § 5's\n\npreclearance requirement is to avoid erosion in minorities’ existing political\n\nopportunities. Beer v. United States, 425 U.S. 130 (1976). Under Beer, a plan is\n\nentitled to preclearance unless it “would lead to a retrogression in the position of\n\nracial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral\n\nfranchise.”26 Id. at 141 (emphasis added).\n\n      In the early 1990’s, the DOJ interpreted § 5's nonretrogression mandate to\n\nrequire both the maximization of the number of majority-minority districts, and the\n\nnumber of minority voters in those districts. Miller, 515 U.S. at 927 (“And the\n\nJustice Department’s implicit command that States engage in presumptively\n\nunconstitutional race-based districting brings the Act, once upheld as a proper\n\nexercise of Congress’ authority under § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, into tension\n\nwith the Fourteenth Amendment”) (citations omitted); Abrams, 521 U.S. at 85-86\n\n(Justice Department’s “max-black” policy unconstitutionally “race-focused”).\n\nSection 5 preclearance depended upon compliance with this policy. Id.\n\n\n\n\n      26\n         It has been suggested that “legislators can be justifiably anxious that they\nwill be ‘damned by the Constitution’ if they consider race and ‘damned by the\nVoting Rights Act’ if they do not.” Katharine Inglis Butler, Redistricting in a\nPost-Shaw Era: A Small Treatise Accompanied by Districting Guidelines for\nLegislators, Litigants, and Courts,” 36 U. Rich. L. Rev. 137, 143 (2002).\n                                           29\n\f      As we have already seen, the County intended to comply fully with this\n\npolicy. The Chairman of the County Commission at the time testified that he\n\ninstructed Coates to develop a plan with two majority black voting districts and to\n\nmaximize the black voting age population in those districts. It was his\n\nunderstanding that the “law” required this result. Coates testified that he, too,\n\nunderstood the law to require both the maintenance of the County’s two majority-\n\nminority districts and the maximization of the black voting age population within\n\nthem, and that he so instructed Ms. Meggers.\n\n      Ms. Meggers testified that she was instructed to maintain the two majority-\n\nminority districts in order to comply with the DOJ’s nonretrogression guidelines.\n\nShe constructed Districts 1 and 2 as supermajority black districts with\n\napproximately 60% black voters. She did so because she “thought that we needed\n\nto maintain 60% black VAP” in order to comply with the DOJ”s “65% rule,”\n\nwhich conditioned preclearance upon a “minimum of 60% black VAP in a\n\nmajority-minority district.”\n\n      In the resulting plan, the City of Eatonton was divided along racial lines so\n\nas to accomplish this maximization of the black population in Districts 1 and 2.\n\nThe County has explicitly conceded that it did so deliberately in an effort to create\n\ntwo districts in which black voters would constitute a super-majority because this\n\nwas the “law.”\n\n                                          30\n\f       In its § 5 submission to the DOJ, the County touted its successful\n\nmaximization of the black vote in Districts 1 and 2:\n\n       Quite simply, the submitted plan . . . creates two voting districts in\n       which black voting strength in Putnam County has been maximized.\n       Such maximization is readily apparent when its remembered that the\n       submitted district voting plan provides for black populations in excess\n       of 60% in two of four voting districts in a county in which African\n       Americans constitute one-third of the population. (Emphasis in\n       original)\n\n       In view of this overwhelming evidence, the district court found that the\n\nCounty’s 1992 plan was designed to comply with the DOJ’s nonretrogression\n\nrequirements by maintaining and maximizing its two majority-minority districts.27\n\nIt also concluded, as a matter of law, that compliance with § 5 is a sufficiently\n\ncompelling state interest to withstand strict scrutiny. Accordingly, the district\n\ncourt held that, even if the County had racially gerrymandered Districts 1 and 2,\n\nmaintenance of these two districts and maximization of the black vote within them\n\ncomplied with the DOJ’s nonretrogression requirements and, therefore, satisfied\n\nthe strict scrutiny test.\n\n       This is not the law. Ironically, at the same time the County was boasting of\n\nits compliance with the DOJ’s “black-maximization” policy, the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n       27\n        “Had the County altered the general scheme of the 1982 districts to\neliminate one of the majority-black districts created by Judge Owens, it would\nhave caused a retrogression in the position of blacks in the electoral process.”\n                                          31\n\fwas in the process of rejecting it. Less than a year after the DOJ precleared the\n\n1992 plan, the Court held that race may not be used as the primary means of\n\nassigning voters to electoral districts.28 Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642. Then, in Miller, the\n\nCourt made clear that it does “not accept the contention that the State has a\n\ncompelling interest in complying with whatever preclearance mandates the Justice\n\nDepartment issues.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 922. The Court specifically held that the\n\nDOJ’s “black-maximization” policy was an invalid interpretation of § 5's\n\nnonretrogression requirement. The Court said:\n\n      In utilizing § 5 to require States to create majority-minority districts\n      wherever possible, the Department of Justice expanded its authority\n      under the statute beyond what Congress intended and we have upheld.\n      . . . [W]e recognized in Beer that “the purpose of § 5 has always been\n      to insure that no voting-procedure changes would be made that would\n      lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect\n      to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.” The Justice\n      Department’s maximization policy seems quite far removed from this\n      purpose. . . . And the Justice Department’s implicit command that\n      States engage in presumptively unconstitutional race-based districting\n      brings the [Voting Rights] Act, once upheld as a proper exercise of\n      Congress’ authority under § 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment . . . into\n      tension with the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . There is no indication\n      Congress intended such a far-reaching application of § 5, so we reject\n      the Justice Department’s interpretation of the statute and avoid the\n      constitutional problems that interpretation raises.\n\n515 U.S. at 925-27 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n      28\n        This decision prompted the Coates letter to the Bailey district court\ninquiring about the continued validity of the “race-based” 1992 redistricting.\n                                          32\n\f      The Court also said that “[w]hen a state governmental entity seeks to justify\n\nrace-based remedies to cure the effects of past discrimination, we do not accept the\n\ngovernment’s mere assertion that the remedial action is required. Rather, we insist\n\non a strong basis in evidence of the harm being remedied.” Id. at 922. Thus,\n\nSection 5 does not confer “carte blanche on the DOJ to command racial\n\ngerrymandering in the name of nonretrogression.” Shaw, 509 U.S. at 655.\n\n“[C]ompliance with federal anti-discrimination laws cannot justify race-based\n\ndistricting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a\n\nconstitutional reading and application of those laws.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 921.\n\n      Accordingly, the district court erred when it held that, even under strict\n\nscrutiny, the 1992 plan survives because the County had a compelling interest in\n\ncomplying with the DOJ’s nonretrogression policy. Race-based districting cannot\n\nsurvive strict scrutiny absent a compelling state interest, and the Court has made\n\nclear that that the DOJ’s requirement of “black maximization” without any\n\nshowing of a constitutional or statutory wrong, is not such an interest. Miller, 515\n\nU.S. at 921; Wygant, 476 U.S. at 277.\n\n      Furthermore, even if “black maximization” were a compelling state interest,\n\nthe 1992 plan would not survive strict scrutiny because it is not narrowly tailored\n\nto meet that interest.\n\n2)    1992 Plan Not Narrowly Tailored\n\n                                         33\n\f      As a result of the 1992 redistricting, Districts 1 and 2 are underpopulated\n\nand Districts 3 and 4 are overpopulated. Ms. Meggers testified that she had to use\n\nthe “tool” of under populating the two majority-minority districts in order to\n\nachieve the County’s goal of a 60% black voting age population in those districts.\n\nThis “challenge” was created by the sharp decline in the County’s black\n\npopulation. There were simply not enough black voters to go around. Only by\n\nunderpopulating the black districts, and overpopulating the white districts was Ms.\n\nMeggers able to create two black voting districts with supermajorities.\n\n      Of course, exact equality of population in electoral districting is not\n\nrequired. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 577. Nor is there any bright-line numerical test to\n\ndetermine when a deviation from population equality is large enough to violate the\n\nconstitutional requirement of one-person, one-vote.29 Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S.\n\n1, 22 (1975). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has instructed that court-ordered\n\nreapportionment plans “must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality\n\nwith little more than de minimis variation.” Id. at 27.\n\n\n\n\n      29\n         The County suggests that the 16% deviation approved in Mahan v. Howell,\n410 U.S. 315 (1973), constitutes some bright line upper limit. We reject this\nartificial line drawing as the Court has made clear that “a particular population\ndeviation from the ideal may be permissible in some cases but not in others.”\nSwann v. Adams, 385 U.S. 440, 445 (1967). See also Chapman, 420 U.S. at 22-23;\n                                          34\n\f      The County’s 1992 plan produced an overall deviation of 10.64%. This is\n\ncertainly more than the de minimis deviation required of court-ordered plans.30 It\n\neven exceeds what the Supreme Court considers to be of “prima facie\n\nconstitutional validity” for legislatively-drawn plans. Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S.\n\n407, 418 (1977) (legislatively-produced deviations under 10% presumptively\n\nvalid).\n\n      More importantly, however, the size of this deviation was not the\n\nunavoidable result of some traditional districting consideration, or even a remedial\n\neffort. On the contrary, it was race-driven. It was the inevitable product of the\n\nCounty’s commitment to maintain and enhance the voting strength of its two black\n\nvoting districts. This goal could only be achieved by the County’s deliberate\n\ndecision to compensate for its declining black population by under populating the\n\ntwo black voting districts and overpopulating the two white districts. Thus, in\n\nsetting out to remedy malapportionment, the County designed a plan which\n\ndeliberately malapportioned its districts.\n\n      The Voting Rights Act does not require this result. City of Richmond v.\n\nUnited States, 422 U.S. 358, 371 (1975). The Supreme Court long ago rejected the\n\n\n      30\n         Although we have concluded that the 1992 plan is a “court-ordered” one,\nour analysis of why the deviation it produced is constitutionally infirm depends not\non its size, but rather on the reason for that size – intentional racial\ngerrymandering.\n                                             35\n\fcontention that § 5 nonretrogression requires the permanent overrepresentation of\n\nminorities and underrepresentation of other elements of the community in order to\n\navoid a diminution in the electoral power of a declining minority population. The\n\nCourt held that neither of these alternatives was intended by Congress. Id. Rather,\n\nin such circumstances, § 5 requires no more than that the number of electoral\n\ndistricts “fairly reflect[] the strength of the [black] community.”31 Id.\n\n      Racial gerrymandering by malapportionment occurs when the deviation\n\nproduced by underpopoulating a majority-minority district is too great to be\n\njustified. The Constitution does not permit the County to intentionally dilute the\n\nvote of any of its citizens. Reynolds, 377 U.S. at 577. The County’s obligation is\n\nto make “an honest and good faith effort to construct districts . . . as nearly of equal\n\npopulation as is practicable.” Id.\n\n      Moreover, the County not only maintained its two minority districts, it\n\nactually succeeded in increasing the black voting age population in one of them,\n\ndespite the decrease in the black population of the County. This was\n\naccomplished, according to County officials, in order to ensure that the voters in\n\n\n\n\n      31\n       Even the DOJ has recognized in its newest guidelines that in some\ncircumstances “retrogression” cannot be avoided. Guidelines 187, at 5413.\n                                          36\n\fDistricts 1 and 2 could elect their choice of candidates and the County government\n\nwould continue to have proportional representation.32\n\n      In Vera, the Court rejected the maximization of the minority vote in a district\n\nin which their population had declined, warning that “[n]onretrogression is not a\n\nlicense for the State to do whatever it deems necessary to insure continued\n\nelectoral success; it merely mandates that the minority’s opportunity to elect\n\nrepresentatives of its choice not be diminished, directly or indirectly, by the State’s\n\nactions.” 517 U.S. at 983 (emphasis in original).33\n\n      Nor does either the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act require racially\n\nproportional representation. Bolden, 446 U.S. at 75-76 (“The Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth amendment does not require proportional representation\n\nas an imperative of political organization”); 42 U.S.C. § 1973b (“[N]othing in this\n\n\n      32\n        All testified that the continued representation of Districts 1 and 2 by “their”\nrepresentatives was an important goal in the redistricting. Since 1982, the Board of\nCommissioners and the Board of Education had both had two black members\n(from Districts 1 and 2) and two white members (from Districts 3 and 4). The\nevidence was that the county commissioners believed that this equality of result\nwas both required by the DOJ for preclearance and desirable from the point of\nview of maintaining racial harmony in the county.\n\n      33\n         This language, coupled with the actual outcome in Vera, implies that when,\nas a result of demographic changes, a jurisdiction faces either creating fewer\nminority districts in its proposed plan than were in its existing plan or engaging in\nsubstantial racial gerrymandering to maintain the status quo, it must opt for the first\nalternative. Butler, 36 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 187.\n                                          37\n\fSection establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers\n\nequal to their proportion in the population”). Awarding public office on the basis\n\nof racial quotas not only offends the equal protection clause, but would “balkanize”\n\nthis country into competing racial factions. Shaw, 509 U.S. at 657. Under such a\n\nsystem, “elected officials are more likely to believe that their primary obligation is\n\nto represent only the members of that group, rather than their constituency as a\n\nwhole. This is altogether antithetical to our system of representative democracy.”\n\nId. at 648. As Justice Douglas explained almost forty years ago:\n\n      Here the individual is important, not his race, his creed, or his color.\n      The principle of equality is at war with the notion that District A must\n      be represented by a Negro, as it is with the notion that District B must\n      be represented by a Caucasian, District C by a Jew, District D by a\n      Catholic, and so on . . . .\n\nId. (quoting Douglas, J., dissenting in Wright v. Rockefeller, 376 U.S. 52, 66-67\n\n(1964)).\n\n      The 1992 plan maintains the two 1982 majority-minority voting districts,\n\nand actually enhances the minority voting strength in one despite a declining\n\nminority population. In order to accomplish this goal, it chose to underpopulate its\n\nother two districts, thereby under representing those voters. Whether there was\n\nanother way to accomplish the County’s goals without diluting the votes in\n\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fDistricts 3 and 4, we cannot say.34 We can say, however, that the 1992 plan,\n\ngerrymandered to guarantee race-based representation in Putnam County, was not\n\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest because it went well beyond\n\nwhat is necessary to avoid retrogression. Vera, 517 U.S. at 983 (citing Shaw, 509\n\nU.S. at 655).35\n\n                                         VII.\n\n      In sum, we hold that Putnam County’s 1992 redistricting plan is\n\nunconstitutional. It assigns voters on the basis of race to electoral districts. Since\n\nit does so, we have strictly scrutinized it to determine whether it is narrowly\n\ntailored to meet a compelling state interest. We hold that it does not meet a\n\ncompelling state interest because it was designed to satisfy the DOJ’s 1992\n\nnonretrogression requirements, which incorrectly interpreted § 5. Furthermore, the\n\nplan is not narrowly tailored because it overpopulates the two majority districts,\n\nthereby unconstitutionally diluting the vote in those districts. Additionally, it\n\nmaximizes the concentration of minority voters in Districts 1 and 2, thereby\n\nseeking unconstitutionally to ensure their electoral success.\n\n\n      34\n        Plaintiffs in this action apparently offered such a plan, but the County\nrejected it.\n      35\n       One of the factors noted by the Court in Vera as indicative of an overly\nbroad approach was the enhancement of minority voting strength in a declining\nminority population district. 517 U.S. at 983.\n                                          39\n\f     Accordingly, the plan is unconstitutional and the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is REVERSED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       40\n\fEDMONDSON, Chief Judge, dissenting:\n\n      As I understand the record, the facts found by the district court are not\n\nclearly erroneous.

The Chairman of the County Commission at the time, Harold Dennis, testified that he told Coates that maintenance of the two majority black voting districts was his and other Commissioners' goal in the reapportionment process in order to ensure racial proportional representation on the County Commission and Board of Education. He testified that county officials instructed Ms. Meggers \"that two of the voting districts [should] have black general populations and voter age populations as high as possible within the constraints of a range of % deviation no greater than, generally, plus or minus five %\" and \"to maximize the black voting strength in Districts One and Two.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Meggers testified that \"her predominant consideration in crafting the plan was to maintain the core of the existing majority minority districts and strive toward a 60% black VAP [voting age population].\" In order to achieve this benchmark, the County instructed her to include \"every contiguous census block available which would have the effect of increasing the black percentage in the two majority black voting districts.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Coates testified that the City of Eatonton was divided so as to maximize the black population within Districts 1 and 2, while keeping as much of the white population as possible within District 3. Bill Moore, the current Chairman of the County Board of Commissioners, testified that the only reason behind District 4's boundary line placement was to include as many blacks within Districts 1 and 2 as possible and make each of these districts majority black. He testified that it was \"common knowledge\" that the \"law\" required this result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These district lines enhanced the black voting strength in Districts 1 and 2, despite the fact that the County had lost almost 8% of its black population between the 1980 and the 1990 censuses. Coates testified that \"we took the plan that existed, we changed it to the extent of attempting to preserve the two majority black districts. We were conscious about the race of the people in the districts in doing that, and we assigned them so as to achieve the majority black districts.\" He testified that he believed that maintenance of the two districts was necessary in order to obtain approval of the plan by the DOJ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the County's &#167; 5 submission to the DOJ describes the reapportionment of Districts 1 and 2 in exclusively racial terms:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[We have] requested [of Ms. Meggers] that two of the four voting districts have black general population and voting age populations as high as possible within constraints of a range of % deviation no greater than generally plus or minus five %. Moreover, local officials requested that the available concentrations of black population be distributed substantially equally between two of the voting districts so that these districts would both be majority black.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This approach to redistricting was specifically employed ... because ... of the fact that since 1982, two county commissions and school board districts have been represented by black representatives elected from majority black districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite simply, the submitted plan ... creates two voting districts in which black voting strength [in] Putnam County has been maximized.

These percentages were obtained by the deliberate manipulation of district lines to maximize the number of black voters in the two challenged districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Ms. Meggers testified that the decline in the black population in the county made the maintenance of racial hegemony in Districts 1 and 2 a \"challenge;\" she was ultimately able to do so only by utilizing the redistricting \"tool\" of keeping the majority black districts at a \"negative population deviation,\" <i>i.e.,</i> an undercount. By deliberately choosing to underpopulate the two majority black districts, she was able to achieve the county's goal of at least 60 % black voting age population within them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Meggers testified that when she did have to add voters to Districts 1 or 2, she was careful to do so in a way that would avoid upsetting her 60% black voter goal. For example, after some initial population shifting, District 2 was still significantly underpopulated, resulting in too great an overall deviation from equal district population. To reduce this deviation, she testified that she reached out into the far north of District 2 to capture a group of voters because they were equally divided racially. She chose this racially balanced group because shifting them from District 3 to District 2 would help balance the districts' populations without doing any \"harm to my numbers.\" The parties refer to this area which protrudes north into District 3 as the \"feather.\" A by-product of the creation of the feather, was the creation of a \"land bridge\" connecting the two parts of District 3 which were virtually bisected by District 2's feather.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar byproducts of Ms. Meggers' redistricting were the \"smokestack\" and the \"pie slice.\" The smokestack, like the feather, was a protrusion into District 3 to pick up voters who would help populate District 2 without upsetting the racial goals. The pie slice is an area cut out of District 2, shaped like a piece of pie, to exclude white voters from District 2. In each of these cases, Ms. Meggers testified that these unnatural shapes were the result of a deliberate attempt to maintain and maximize the strength in the black voting districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lightly reverse a district court's findings of fact.

Contrary to everything said by the County during the plan's creation and implementation, and the uncontroverted, solemn representations made by it to the Department of Justice, upon which the plan received &#167; 5 preclearance, the district court found that race did not predominate over traditional factors in the 1992 plan.

First, it had to ignore the extensive testimony from all involved that race was the primary focus of the redistricting process. Second, it had to totally discount the County's own assertions, indeed admissions, in its &#167; 5 submission to the DOJ that race was the paramount consideration in the redistricting process.

The testimony was overwhelming that no shift was made that would have \"done damage\" to Ms. Meggers' goal of 60% black voting age population in Districts 1 and 2. In view of this record, even the district court conceded that \"it is virtually beyond dispute ... that the County intended to maintain these districts as majority-minority districts in 1992.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the court concluded that race did not <i>predominate</i> over traditional districting principles, because it found that the County's four electoral districts are relatively compact, adhere to natural boundaries, preserve communities of interest, and protect incumbents. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"mere recitation\" that traditional factors were not subordinated to race is insufficient to insulate the County's decision to maximize the black populations of Districts 1 and 2. <i>Miller,</i> 515 U.S. at 919, 115 S.Ct. 2475. The County's contention that traditional factors were not subordinated to race is not supported by the record. The evidence is overwhelming that the County decided at the outset to maintain its two black voting districts and to assign as much of the black voting age population as possible to those districts. This agenda was never seriously questioned until after the Supreme Court's 1992 decision in <i>Shaw</i> which prompted the County to inquire of the district court concerning the constitutionality of its two race-based districts. <i>See Vera,</i> 517 U.S. at 961, 116 S.Ct. 1941.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that other considerations may have played a role in the County's redistricting does not mean that race did not predominate.

If the line-drawing process is shown to have been infected by such a deliberate racial purpose, strict scrutiny cannot be avoided simply by demonstrating that the shape and location of the districts can rationally be explained by reference to some districting principle other than race, for the intentional classification of voters by race, though perhaps disguised, is still likely to reflect the \"impermissible racial stereotypes,\" \"illegitimate notions of racial inferiority\" and \"simple racial politics\" that strict scrutiny is designed to \"smoke out.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Shaw v.

The district court concluded that this fact militated against a finding that race predominated over this traditional districting factor. The Supreme Court, however, has rejected this conclusion. <i>Miller</i> instructs that \"bizarreness\" of shape is not a threshold showing for racial gerrymandering.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> 515 U.S. at 915, 115 S.Ct. 2475. Shape must be considered in conjunction with racial and population densities, <i>id.</i> at 917, 115 S.Ct. 2475, and in this case those factors militate against a finding that compactness trumped race when it came to reapportioning the districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intentionally, over 90% of the county's black population was assigned to either District 1 or 2. The \"feather,\" \"smokestack,\" and \"pie slice\" all indicate that when Ms. Meggers was looking for population to shift to bring her \"deviation\" into constitutional range, race determined who should be shifted. The fact that the resulting irregularities in natural boundaries are small does not undermine the inevitable conclusion that they are there at all precisely because their racial composition helped achieve the plan's racial goals. <i>See Miller,</i> 515 U.S. at 917, 115 S.Ct. 2475 (such deliberate racial line-drawing supports a finding that race predominated in the redistricting process).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Race not only determined who <i>was</i> shifted in the 1992 redistricting process; even more importantly, it also determined who was <i>not.</i> Ms. Meggers could have reduced her almost 11% deviation from equal district population by shifting voters from the overpopulated \"white\" districts into the underpopulated contiguous \"black\" districts. She chose not to, however, because to do so would have done \"harm\" to her [racial] \"numbers.\" As a result, the County, which undertook the 1992 redistricting to correct malapportionment, remains significantly malapportioned. The County's commitment to the constitutional mandate of one-person, one-vote was secondary to its primary racial agenda. This the Constitution does not permit. <i>Reynolds,</i> 377 U.S. at 568, 84 S.Ct. 1362; <i>Shaw,</i> 509 U.S. at 642, 113 S.Ct. 2816; <i>Miller,</i> 515 U.S. at 913, 115 S.Ct. 2475.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Communities of Interest</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also concluded that the plan elevated communities of interest over race in the redistricting process. It offered this explanation for District 3's \"pie slice\" which pulls population out of District 2 and places them into District 3. The district court approved the inclusion of the pie slice in District 3 because it is \"characterized by fine, old houses and populated by a predominately affluent population, in contrast to the humbler conditions in the urban areas of District Two.\" The court concluded that, without the pie slice, there would have been an \"unnatural division of this distinct community of interest.\" Even if assignment of voters on the basis of socio-economic status is a legitimate, traditional districting principle, which appears unlikely, nothing in the record suggests that this was the reason for carving the pie slice out of District 2. On the other hand, the census tracts make clear that the population in the pie slice was largely white and would have done \"damage\" to Ms. Meggers' \"numbers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Incumbency</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court accepted the County's and Ms. Meggers' contention that incumbency was, in fact, the primary consideration in the reapportionment process. While it is undoubtedly true that the County was interested in protecting incumbents, it is clear that \"racially motivated gerrymandering had a qualitatively greater influence on the drawing of district lines than politically motivated gerrymandering, and that political gerrymandering was accomplished in large part by the use of race as a proxy.\" <i>Vera,</i> 517 U.S. at 969, 116 S.Ct. 1941. The County sought to protect its two black incumbents by maximizing the black population in their districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a> Incumbency protection achieved by using race as a proxy is evidence of racial gerrymandering. <i>Id.</i> at 970, 116 S.Ct. 1941.

There is none because the district court specifically excluded this evidence. Intervenors, the NAACP and several individual voters, urged the district court to hear evidence of racially polarized voting in Putnam County. They argued that this evidence was necessary to meet the strict scrutiny test, <i>i.e.,</i> establish a compelling state interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused, noting that it was undisputed that the 1992 redistricting plan was developed as the result of <i>malapportionment,</i> the unequal distribution of <i>people</i> across district lines. Therefore, the 1992 redistricting plan was simply a <i>reapportionment</i> plan, and not a <i>remedial</i> plan developed as the result of a finding of &#167; 2 liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor could it have been. The County already had two majority-minority districts, each consistently electing minority candidates, and there was no showing whatsoever that, in 1992, there was any need to remedy any minority vote dilution within these districts. In fact, the minority voters in these districts were already <i>over-represented</i> as the result of the underpopulation of these districts in relation to Districts 3 and 4. Thus, in this case, the district court correctly refused to hear evidence of that the 1992 plan was adopted to remedy minority vote dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the district court concluded that the 1992 plan is justifiable as a remedy for past unlawful discrimination. It based this conclusion on the demonstration of &#167; 2 liability &#8212; vote dilution and racial bloc voting &#8212; which underlay the court-ordered 1982 plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was error. The need for a race-based remedy in 1992 cannot be established by reliance on a 1982 wrong that has already been remedied. <i>Wygant v.

Nor can the court rely on some \"generalized assertion of past discrimination\" to justify a race-based remedy. <i>Shaw v.

Since there is no evidence in this record of an unremedied discriminatory purpose or effect in the County's electoral districting, the district court erred when it held that County had a compelling interest in remedying such discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Non-retrogression as a Compelling State Interest</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has consistently held that the purpose of &#167; 5's preclearance requirement is to avoid erosion in minorities' existing political opportunities. <i>Beer v.

The Chairman of the County Commission at the time testified that he instructed Coates to develop a plan with two majority black voting districts and to maximize the black voting age population in those districts. It was his understanding that the \"law\" required this result. Coates testified that he, too, understood the law to require both the maintenance of the County's two majority-minority districts and the maximization of the black voting age population within them, and that he so instructed Ms. Meggers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Meggers testified that she was instructed to maintain the two majority-minority districts in order to comply with the DOJ's nonretrogression guidelines. She constructed Districts 1 and 2 as supermajority black districts with approximately 60% black voters. She did so because she \"thought that we needed to maintain 60% black VAP\" in order to comply with the DOJ's \"65% rule,\" which conditioned preclearance upon a \"minimum of 60% black VAP in a majority-minority district.\" In the resulting plan, the City of Eatonton was divided along racial lines so as to accomplish this maximization of the black population in Districts 1 and 2. The County has explicitly conceded that it did so deliberately in an effort to create two districts in which black voters would constitute a super-majority because this was the \"law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its &#167; 5 submission to the DOJ, the County touted its successful maximization of the black vote in Districts 1 and 2:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite simply, the submitted plan ... creates two voting districts in which black voting strength in Putnam County has been maximized.

Accordingly, the district court held that, even if the County had racially gerrymandered Districts 1 and 2, maintenance of these two districts and maximization of the black vote within them complied with the DOJ's nonretrogression requirements and, therefore, satisfied the strict scrutiny test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the law. Ironically, at the same time the County was boasting of its compliance with the DOJ's \"black-maximization\" policy, the Supreme Court was in the process of rejecting it. Less than a year after the DOJ precleared the 1992 plan, the Court held that race may not be used as the primary means of assigning voters to electoral districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a> <i>Shaw,</i> 509 U.S. at 642, 113 S.Ct. 2816.

This \"challenge\" was created by the sharp decline in the County's black population. There were simply not enough black voters to go around.

On the contrary, it was race-driven. It was the inevitable product of the County's commitment to maintain and enhance the voting strength of its two black voting districts. This goal could only be achieved by the County's deliberate decision to compensate for its declining black population by under populating the two black voting districts and overpopulating the two white districts.

The Supreme Court long ago rejected the contention that &#167; 5 nonretrogression requires the permanent overrepresentation of minorities and underrepresentation of other elements of the community in order to avoid a diminution in the electoral power of a declining minority population.

Furthermore, the plan is not narrowly tailored because it overpopulates the two majority districts, thereby unconstitutionally diluting the vote in those districts.

He had represented the plaintiffs suing the County in <i>Bailey v. Vining,</i> which resulted in the court-ordered, remedial redistricting of 1981. Coates, along with the County, consulted with Linda Meggers of the Georgia Reapportionment Services Office in Atlanta, an office established by the legislature to provide technical assistance to local governments engaged in redistricting. It was Ms. Meggers who, at the direction of the County, actually produced the 1992 plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan was approved by a majority vote of the County's Board of Commissioners, and, pursuant to the Georgia Constitution, was presented to the legislature for its approval. Regrettably, the legislature followed a course not unfamiliar to those observing state action in matters of this sort. In short, the legislature walked away from the issue; defaulted its responsibility to deal with Georgia election matters; and failed to take any action on the 1992 reapportionment plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The County, through Coates, took the plan to the district judge who, in <i>Bailey v. Vining,</i> had ordered the 1982 redistricting. The County asked the court to amend its 1981 judgment by adopting the 1992 plan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Although the <i>Bailey</i> case had long been closed, the district court agreed and ordered the implementation of the new plan on an \"interim\" basis, until the Georgia legislature could adopt a constitutionally satisfactory reapportionment plan. Once the plan was enacted, however, no further efforts for legislative approval were undertaken.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The County did submit the plan to the Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") for its approval.

These percentages were obtained by the deliberate manipulation of district lines to maximize the number of black voters in the two challenged districts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Ms. Meggers testified that the decline in the black population in the county made the maintenance of racial hegemony in Districts 1 and 2 a \"challenge;\" she was ultimately able to do so only by utilizing the redistricting \"tool\" of keeping the majority black districts at a \"negative population deviation,\" <i>i.e.,</i> an undercount. By deliberately choosing to underpopulate the two majority black districts, she was able to achieve the county's goal of at least 60 % black voting age population within them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ms. Meggers testified that when she did have to add voters to Districts 1 or 2, she was careful to do so in a way that would avoid upsetting her 60% black voter goal. For example, after some initial population shifting, District 2 was still significantly underpopulated, resulting in too great an overall deviation from equal district population. To reduce this deviation, she testified that she reached out into the far north of District 2 to capture a group of voters because they were equally divided racially. She chose this racially balanced group because shifting them from District 3 to District 2 would help balance the districts' populations without doing any \"harm to my numbers.\" The parties refer to this area which protrudes north into District 3 as the \"feather.\" A by-product of the creation of the feather, was the creation of a \"land bridge\" connecting the two parts of District 3 which were virtually bisected by District 2's feather.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similar byproducts of Ms. Meggers' redistricting were the \"smokestack\" and the \"pie slice.\" The smokestack, like the feather, was a protrusion into District 3 to pick up voters who would help populate District 2 without upsetting the racial goals. The pie slice is an area cut out of District 2, shaped like a piece of pie, to exclude white voters from District 2. In each of these cases, Ms. Meggers testified that these unnatural shapes were the result of a deliberate attempt to maintain and maximize the strength in the black voting districts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not lightly reverse a district court's findings of fact.

The fact that the resulting irregularities in natural boundaries are small does not undermine the inevitable conclusion that they are there at all precisely because their racial composition helped achieve the plan's racial goals. <i>See Miller,</i> 515 U.S. at 917, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117968\"><a href=\"/opinion/117968/miller-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

She chose not to, however, because to do so would have done \"harm\" to her [racial] \"numbers.\" As a result, the County, which undertook the 1992 redistricting to correct malapportionment, remains significantly malapportioned.

It offered this explanation for District 3's \"pie slice\" which pulls population out of District 2 and places them into District 3. The district court approved the inclusion of the pie slice in District 3 because it is \"characterized by fine, old houses and populated by a predominately affluent population, in contrast to the humbler conditions in the urban areas of District Two.\" The court concluded that, without the pie slice, there would have been an \"unnatural division of this distinct community of interest.\" Even if assignment of voters on the basis of socio-economic status is a legitimate, traditional districting principle, which appears unlikely, nothing in the record suggests that this was the reason for carving the pie slice out of District 2.

In fact, the minority voters in these districts were already <i>over-represented</i> as the result of the underpopulation of these districts in relation to Districts 3 and 4.

The Chairman of the County Commission at the time testified that he instructed Coates to develop a plan with two majority black voting districts and to maximize the black voting age population in those districts. It was his understanding that the \"law\" required this result.

She did so because she \"thought that we needed to maintain 60% black VAP\" in order to comply with the DOJ's \"65% rule,\" which conditioned preclearance upon a \"minimum of 60% black VAP in a majority-minority district.\" In the resulting plan, the City of Eatonton was divided along racial lines so as to accomplish this maximization of the black population in Districts 1 and 2. The County has explicitly conceded that it did so deliberately in an effort to create two districts in which black voters would constitute a super-majority because this was the \"law.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its &#167; 5 submission to the DOJ, the County touted its successful maximization of the black vote in Districts 1 and 2:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quite simply, the submitted plan ... creates two voting districts in which black voting strength in Putnam County has been maximized.

Accordingly, the district court held that, even if the County had racially gerrymandered Districts 1 and 2, maintenance of these two districts and maximization of the black vote within them complied with the DOJ's nonretrogression requirements and, therefore, satisfied the strict scrutiny test.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not the law.

In order to accomplish this goal, it chose to underpopulate its other two districts, thereby under representing those voters.

Since 1982, the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Education had both had two black members (from Districts 1 and 2) and two white members (from Districts 3 and 4). The evidence was that the county commissioners believed that this equality of result was both required by the DOJ for preclearance and desirable from the point of view of maintaining racial harmony in the county</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn33\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33_ref\">33</a>\n        <p> This language, coupled with the actual outcome in<i>Vera,</i> implies that when, as a result of demographic changes, a jurisdiction faces either creating fewer minority districts in its proposed plan than were in its existing plan or engaging in substantial racial gerrymandering to maintain the status quo, it must opt for the first alternative.
