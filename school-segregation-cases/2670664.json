Woodyard filed a lawsuit under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging violations of his First and Eighth Amendment rights.\n\nHe asserted that another inmate stabbed him seven times, almost severing two of\n\nhis fingers, while a prison guard stood idly by. He also alleged that other prison\n\nofficials placed him in the “segregation unit” at the prison in retaliation for\n\ncomplaining about the attack. Woodyard moved for a preliminary injunction\n\nordering the defendants to: (1) separate him from his alleged attacker; and\n\n(2) remove him from the segregation unit. A magistrate judge issued a report\n\nrecommending the denial of his motion. The district court adopted that report and\n\nrecommendation over Woodyard’s objection. He now appeals the denial of his\n\nmotion.1\n\n       We generally have jurisdiction to review orders denying preliminary\n\ninjunctions, see 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), but the defendants contend that we must\n\ndismiss Woodyard’s appeal because it is moot. Nat’l Ass’n of Bds. of Pharmacy v.\n\nBd. of Regents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 633 F.3d 1297, 1309 (11th Cir. 2011)\n\n   1\n      Since the filing of this appeal, the district court has granted summary judgment to the\ndefendants on all of Woodyard’s claims but one: the claim against the officer who allegedly\nfailed to stop the attack on Woodyard. The district court has appointed counsel for Woodyard\nand scheduled a bench trial on this claim.\n\n                                               2\n\f              Case: 13-14109     Date Filed: 07/02/2015    Page: 3 of 5\n\n\n(explaining that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction over a moot appeal).\n\nWe consider mootness de novo. Id. In his motion, Woodyard asked the district\n\ncourt to order his separation from his alleged attacker. After the denial of that\n\nmotion, the alleged attacker was transferred to a different prison. No court should\n\norder defendants to do what has already been done. This first part of Woodyard’s\n\nappeal is moot and must be dismissed. See Calderon v. Moore, 518 U.S. 149, 150,\n\n116 S. Ct. 2066, 2067 (1996) (“[A]n appeal should therefore be dismissed as moot\n\nwhen, by virtue of an intervening event, a court of appeals cannot grant any\n\neffectual relief whatever in favor of the appellant.”) (citation omitted) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      The transfer of Woodyard’s alleged attacker, however, does not moot the\n\nother part of this appeal, in which he contends that he should be removed from the\n\nsegregation unit. We review only for an abuse of discretion the district court’s\n\ndenial of a preliminary injunction ordering Woodyard’s removal from segregation.\n\nSee Scott v. Roberts, 612 F.3d 1279, 1289 (11th Cir. 2010). To the extent that\n\ndenial relied on findings of fact, we review them only for clear error. See id.\n\nWoodyard was entitled to a preliminary injunction only if he showed: (1) “a\n\nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable injury will be\n\nsuffered unless the injunction issues; (3) the threatened injury to [him] outweighs\n\nwhatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the [defendants]; and (4) if\n\n\n                                           3\n\f               Case: 13-14109     Date Filed: 07/02/2015    Page: 4 of 5\n\n\nissued, the injunction would not be adverse to the public interest.” Siegel v.\n\nLePore, 234 F.3d 1163, 1176 (11th Cir. 2000) (en banc). Woodyard must clearly\n\nestablish each of the four factors, and the failure to show any of them is fatal to his\n\nappeal. See ACLU of Fla., Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty. School Bd., 557 F.3d 1177,\n\n1198 (11th Cir. 2009).\n\n      We begin and end with the first: whether Woodyard has clearly established\n\na substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claim. He alleges that the\n\ndefendants placed him in the segregation unit in retaliation for complaining about\n\nthe alleged attack. Retaliating against a prisoner by punishing him for filing a\n\ngrievance concerning the conditions of his confinement violates the First\n\nAmendment. See Boxer X v. Harris, 437 F.3d 1107, 1112 (11th Cir. 2006).\n\nWoodyard asserts that he was found “not guilty” of fighting with the other inmate\n\nwho attacked him, and the defendants placed him in the segregation unit as a\n\nretaliatory punishment. A disciplinary report in the record agrees that he was\n\nfound “not guilty” of “fighting with a weapon.” It goes on to show, however, that\n\nprison officials found Woodyard “guilty” of a different offense:\n\n      Woodyard was found not guilty of the fighting with a weapon\n      disciplinary due to his wounds were considered defensive [sic],\n      however through investigation it was determined that inmate\n      Woodyard initiated the confrontation by approaching the other inmate\n      with a knife trying to collect money.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                 Case: 13-14109       Date Filed: 07/02/2015     Page: 5 of 5\n\n\nR. 232 (emphasis added). Based on that evidence, Woodyard has not clearly\n\nestablished a substantial likelihood of success as to his retaliation claim. The\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion by denying his request for a preliminary\n\ninjunction.\n\n         DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART. 2\n\n\n\n\n   2\n       Woodyard’s motion to file his reply brief out of time is GRANTED.\n\n                                               5\n\f",
