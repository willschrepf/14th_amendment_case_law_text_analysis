No. 202857)\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         A jury convicted defendants Justin Alan Meskan and Robert Nathan Allen of\nassaulting two men but rejected allegations that the assaults were hate crimes motivated\nby the victims‘ race, ethnicity or national origin. Defendants were each sentenced to eight\nyears in prison. Defendants raise multiple issues in separate appeals, which are\nconsolidated for review. Meskan claims the prosecutor used suggestive questioning\nduring cross-examination to introduce testimonial statements of an absent witness in\nviolation of defendant‘s right to confront witnesses against him. Meskan and Allen claim\nprosecutorial misconduct during opening and closing statements to the jury; wrongful\nadmission of evidence linking defendants with White supremacist groups; and sentencing\nerrors. We find no prejudicial error and shall affirm the judgments.\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                              STATEMENT OF FACTS\n       On the night of November 9, 2010, cousins Alex Cauich-Dzul and Jose Omar\nCauich went to the Nite Cap Bar in San Francisco‘s Tenderloin District.1 Alex and Omar\nare Mexican nationals. Alex testified that he left the bar and was standing on the sidewalk\nwaiting for Omar when someone came up to him and punched him in the face. A second\npunch landed immediately after the first, and he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.\nOmar looked out the bar‘s window to see Alex on the ground being punched and kicked\nby five White men. Omar ran from the bar, beer bottle in hand, to defend his cousin and\nwas himself punched and kicked by the men.\n       A neighborhood resident saw the group confront Omar. The witness heard\nsomeone in the group of White men yell, ―why don‘t you run across the street, you\nfucking spics, like you run across the border.‖ One of the White men then punched Omar.\nAnother man took the beer bottle from Omar‘s hand and hit him on the head with it.\nOmar fell to the ground. The White men ―kicked . . . stomped and punched‖ Omar ―for a\nlong period of time‖ while yelling ―White power‖ and ―fucking spics.‖\n       The police arrived on the scene in a patrol car with lights on and the siren\nsounding. An officer saw Alex, bloodied and ―semi-unconscious,‖ being dragged from\nthe street to the sidewalk by Omar and another man. The man assisting Alex then walked\naway and was seen near another man leaving the scene. Omar said the two men had been\nin the group of attackers and the police detained them. They were identified as Anthony\nWeston, who had assisted Alex, and defendant Allen. Weston was released and Allen was\narrested.\n       Several hours later the police conducted a search of Allen‘s apartment, located on\nGeary Street only blocks from the bar. Allen lived with Weston and another man, Richard\nTrietsch, and the two were home at the time of the search. When the police investigator\nentered the studio apartment, she saw taped to the wall a photograph depicting Trietsch\n\n1\n       Given a shared family name, we use the men‘s chosen first names: Alex and Omar. Omar\nwas in Mexico at the time of trial and unavailable to testify. A transcript of his preliminary\nhearing testimony was read to the jury.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fsaluting a swastika flag. Trietsch has a swastika tattoo on his leg. A walk-in closet was\nsearched and found to contain school work with Allen‘s handwritten name, paperwork\nbelonging to Trietsch, and a hammer. The police found a paper that appeared to be a code\nkey with runic writing set next to the English alphabet and coded phrases that, when\ntranslated, read ―White power,‖ ―sick man‖ and ―Trietsch.‖ The runic alphabet is used by\nskinheads as a secret language. The hammer had ―sick man‖ etched on it in runic code.\nTrietsch said the hammer belonged to him. Four computers were found during the police\nsearch. The police seized two of the computers, which they believed belonged to Allen.\nOne of the seized computers had ―pictures of Hitler and swastikas‖ as desktop wallpaper\nor a screen saver.\n       Three men were charged with a racially motivated attack: Weston and defendants\nAllen and Meskan, whom Weston identified as his accomplices. Weston had been friends\nwith Allen and Meskan for years before the incident. Weston pleaded guilty and agreed\nto cooperate with the prosecution in exchange for a grant of probation.\n       Weston testified that on the day of the street fight he began drinking when he\nawoke in the morning. Later that day, he went out drinking with Allen and Meskan. The\nmen returned to the Geary Street apartment late at night where they joined Trietsch and\ncontinued drinking. Meskan decided to go home and the other men walked with him,\nintending to ―hit bars on the way.‖ The four men were walking toward the Nite Cap Bar\nwhen they saw Alex. Weston‘s trial account differs from Alex‘s testimony of an\nunprovoked attack. Weston claimed that Alex bumped into him and Allen while crossing\nthe street. Weston sarcastically said, ―excuse me,‖ and Alex reportedly responded by\nsaying ―fuck you‖ or ―something to that effect‖ and raised his hands ―like he wanted to\nfight.‖ Weston punched Alex in the face. Weston is five feet eleven inches tall. Alex is\nabout five feet three inches tall. Alex was stumbling backwards from Weston‘s blow\nwhen Meskan came up and punched Alex in the face. Alex fell to the ground, landing in\nthe middle of the street. Meskan and Allen kicked Alex several times as he lay in the\nstreet. Weston did not see Trietsch strike Alex.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       According to Weston, Omar then ran up to the group with a beer bottle in his\nhand. Weston knocked the bottle from his hand and hit him. Omar fell against a parked\ntruck and Meskan punched Omar, knocking him to the ground. Weston kicked Omar\nonce then ―kind of felt like [Omar] had had enough.‖ Weston saw that Alex was still\nlying in the street and, with another man, dragged Alex to the sidewalk. Weston heard\npolice sirens and started to make his ―get away‖ but was detained by the police, along\nwith Allen. Meskan was walking further ahead and was not stopped.\n       At trial, Weston insisted that the beating of Alex and Omar was not racially\nmotivated. Weston denied being a racist although he admitted being ―affiliated‖ with\nwhite supremacist ―skinhead‖ groups in the past and having the word ―skin‖ tattooed on\nhis side. Weston said Allen and Meskan were not skinheads, that the computer seized\nfrom the Geary Street apartment with the Hitler screen saver belonged to Trietsch, not\nAllen, and that Trietsch is a White supremacist. Weston denied hearing any racial slurs\nduring the street fight. Weston did see Allen raise his hands in the air at the end of the\nfight and say something like ―this is our town.‖\n       Meskan testified and denied being present at the street fight. Meskan said he was\nwith his girlfriend until about 10:00 p.m. and then at home alone watching television. On\ncross-examination, Meskan admitted that he identified himself to jailers as a skinhead\nwhen arrested in March 2009 and again in December 2010 when arrested for the present\noffense. The prosecutor questioned Meskan about a conversation he had with Heather\nWilliams, a friend of Meskan‘s girlfriend, who did not testify at trial. The prosecutor\nasked Meskan if he told Williams he had ―been in a drunken brawl‖ at the Nite Cap Bar\n―with a couple of Mexicans.‖ Meskan denied making such a statement.\n\n                           VERDICT AND SENTENCING\n       The jury convicted defendants of (1) assault upon Alex by means of force likely to\ncause great bodily injury (Pen. Code, § 245, subd. (a)(1))2 with personal infliction of\ngreat bodily injury (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)); (2) simple assault upon Omar (§ 240) (a lesser\n2\n       All further section references are to the Penal Code except as noted.\n\n\n                                                4\n\fincluded offense to the charged crime of aggravated assault); and (3) battery upon Alex\nwith personal infliction of serious bodily injury (§ 243, subd. (d)). The jury found not true\nallegations that the assaults and battery were hate crimes committed because of the\nvictims‘ race, ethnicity or national origin. In a separate proceeding, the court found\ndefendants had prior prison commitments. (§ 667.5, subd. (b).)\n       The court sentenced each defendant to eight years in prison: the upper term of\nfour years for the assault upon Alex with a three-year enhancement for inflicting great\nbodily injury plus one year for a prior prison commitment. Sentence for the battery upon\nAlex was stayed. (§ 654.) A concurrent county jail term of six months was imposed for\nthe assault upon Omar.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\nA Justin Meskan’s appeal\n1. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct when cross-examining defendant Meskan.\n       Meskan claims the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking suggestive\nquestions about a conversation with Heather Williams when Williams was unavailable as\na witness to corroborate the statements attributed to him by the questions. The prosecutor\nasked Meskan if he told Williams he had been in a drunken brawl with a couple\nMexicans, and Meskan denied making such a statement.3 Meskan argues that the line of\n\n\n3\n         The disputed cross-examination was as follows: ―Q. Do you know an individual by the\nname of Heather Williams? [¶] A. Yes. [¶] Q. How long have you known her for? [¶] A. Can‘t\nsay exactly. Maybe two or three years, maybe. [¶] [Defense Counsel:] I‘m going to object to this\nas irrelevant, your Honor. [¶] The Court: Overruled. [¶] Q. . . . Would you consider her to be a\ngood friend? [¶] No. [¶] Q . . . In November of 2010, how often would you socialize or speak\nwith Heather Williams? [¶] A. She was Lindsey‘s [Meskan‘s girlfriend] best friend. So, I mean, I\nwould see her frequently, you know, here and there, but not a good friend, no. [¶] Q. And after\nthis incident was reported to you, . . . you talked with Lindsey – [¶] [Defense Counsel:] Your\nHonor, I‘m going to object to this specifically in light of earlier proceedings in this case. [¶] The\nCourt: . . . What is your question, Mr. [Prosecutor]? [¶] Q. . . . You spoke with Lindsey Powell\nand Heather Williams about your involvement in this case? [¶] [Defense Counsel]: That‘s my\nobjection, Your Honor. [¶] The Court: Overruled. He may answer. [¶] [A.] There is no\ninvolvement in this case. [¶] Q. . . . Okay. Specifically, one week after this incident, you met in\nperson with Heather Williams while you guys were taking care of Robert Allen‘s effects?\n[¶] A. Yeah. I met her to, um, put all the stuff in storage, yeah. [¶] Q. Okay. And, at that time,\n\n                                                 5\n\fquestioning effectively introduced Williams‘s testimonial statements without an\nopportunity for cross-examination in violation of his right to confront witnesses against\nhim. (Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541 U.S. 36, 59.) He also contends ― ‗ ―[i]t was\nimproper to ask questions which clearly suggested the existence of facts which would\nhave been harmful to defendant, in the absence of a good faith belief by the prosecutor\nthat the questions would be answered in the affirmative, or with a belief on his part that\nthe facts could be proved, and a purpose to prove them, if their existence should be\ndenied.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Mooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1233; quoting People v. Perez\n(1962) 58 Cal.2d 229, 241.)\n       While testimonial statements of a witness absent from trial are inadmissible unless\nthe declarant is unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant had a prior opportunity for\ncross-examination (Crawford v. Washington, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 59), no testimonial\nstatements of an absent witness were presented here. Defendant was twice asked if he\nmade statements to Williams, which he denied. Defendant argues that ―the prosecutor‘s\nquestions relayed to the jurors the substance of Ms. Williams[‘s] out-of-court statements\nthat appellant admitted to her that he was involved in a bar fight with Mexican men.‖ But\na prosecutor‘s questions are not evidence. (People v. Samayoa (1997) 15 Cal.4th 795,\n843-844.) The jury was clearly instructed on this point at both the start and end of trial:\n― ‗Evidence‘ is the sworn testimony of witnesses, the exhibits admitted into evidence, and\nanything else [the court] told [the jury] to consider as evidence. Nothing that the\nattorneys say is evidence. . . . Their questions are not evidence. Only the witnesses‘\nanswers are evidence. The attorneys‘ questions are significant only if they helped you to\nunderstand the witnesses‘ answers. Do not assume that something is true just because one\n\n\nyou told her that you had been engaged in a drunken brawl at the Nite Cap Bar? [¶] A. That was\nnever said. [¶] Q. Okay. And you told her, at that time, that you had just been in a drunken brawl\nwith a couple of Mexicans? [¶] A. That was never said. [¶] Q. Okay. Does Heather Williams\nhave it out for you? [¶] A. I don‘t think so. [¶] Q. Okay. Can you think of any reason why she\nwould go tell the police that? [¶] [Defense Counsel:] Well, I‘m going to object to that. That‘s\nassuming facts not in evidence, Your Honor. [¶] . . . [¶] And it‘s hearsay as well. [¶] The Court:\nOverruled. But I‘ll sustain the objection based on speculation.‖\n\n\n                                                6\n\fof the attorneys asked a question that suggested it was true.‖ (CALCRIM No. 222, italics\nadded.). The prosecutor‘s questions did not introduce testimonial evidence in violation of\nMeskan‘s right to confront witnesses against him.\n       Also unavailing is defendant‘s contention that the prosecutor lacked a proper basis\nfor asking defendant about his conversation with Williams and ―engaged in a deliberate\nattempt to put inadmissible and prejudicial evidence before the jury.‖ The prosecutor had\na factual basis for asking about the conversation, the substance of which was not\ninadmissible. At the preliminary hearing, a police officer testified that Williams reported\na conversation with Weston and Meskan in which they admitted being ―in a fight with a\ncouple of Mexicans.‖ Williams was called as a witness at the preliminary hearing and\nconfirmed that Meskan told her ―[h]e was there, and then he got into a fight.‖ Williams\nwas a reluctant witness and after answering a few questions she invoked her right against\nself-incrimination, refusing to testify further. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)4 Meskan‘s\nattorney moved in limine to preclude the prosecutor from using Williams‘s preliminary\nhearing testimony, claiming there had been an inadequate opportunity for cross-\nexamination. The prosecutor said he did not intend to use the preliminary hearing\ntestimony and the motion was granted. The prosecutor called Williams as a witness at\ntrial but, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, she again refused to\ntestify. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) Consequently, when Meskan later testified and denied\ntelling Williams he had ―been in a drunken brawl with a couple of Mexicans,‖ the\nprosecutor was unable to call Williams to impeach his testimony.\n       The unavailability of impeaching evidence, however, does not establish\nprosecutorial misconduct in asking a question that was founded on prior testimony. There\nis, to be sure, danger in permitting a prosecutor to attribute statements to an absent third\nparty during cross-examination of a defendant. Such questions may suggest to jurors that\n―the prosecutor had a source of information unknown to them which corroborated the\ntruth of the matters in question. The rule is well established that the prosecuting attorney\n4\n        Counsel for Williams later explained that Williams might be found in violation of her\nparole if she admitted associating with Meskan.\n\n\n                                                7\n\fmay not interrogate witnesses solely ‗for the purpose of getting before the jury the facts\ninferred therein, together with the insinuations and suggestions they inevitably contained,\nrather than for the answers which might be given.‘ ‖ (People v. Wagner (1975) 13 Cal.3d\n612, 619.) On this record, however, we cannot say the prosecutor‘s question was asked in\nbad faith or that the trial court erroneously rejected defense allegations of bad faith. The\nprosecutor was not required to assume that defendant would deny making a statement\nthat the prosecutor had reasonable grounds to believe he had made. Consistent with\ndefendant‘s denial of involvement in the assault, he might just as well have answered that\nWilliams misunderstood his statement, that he made the statement in jest, or provided\nsome other explanation for making the statement although denying its truth.\n       Were there any impropriety in asking the questions, the jury instruction given here\nmakes it unlikely the jury was misled by any suggestion implicit in the questions. The\njury was cautioned in clear and explicit terms: ―Do not assume that something is true just\nbecause one of the attorneys asked a question that suggested it was true.‖ (CALCRIM\nNo. 222.) As a reviewing court, ―[w]e presume the jury obeyed the trial court‘s\ninstruction that questions posed by the attorneys are not evidence.‖ (People v. Hinton\n(2006) 37 Cal.4th 839, 864.) Defendant claims the presumption is rebutted here because\nthe jury sent a note to the court during deliberations requesting Meskan‘s cross-\nexamination testimony and the Williams police report. The note reflects the jury‘s\ninterest in the matter but also its focus on the truth of the matter in seeking the police\nreport as evidence of any statements attributed to Williams by the prosecutor‘s\nquestioning. The court responded to the jury‘s question: ―[t]he police report is not in\nevidence and cannot be considered during your deliberations.‖ Following the court‘s\nresponse, there is even less reason to assume that the jury disregarded the instructions and\nrelied upon statements implied in the prosecutor‘s questions.\n       Moreover, apart from any suggestion contained in the prosecutor‘s cross-\nexamination, there was compelling evidence that Meskan participated in the fight.\nMeskan‘s long-time friend, Weston, testified that Meskan was with him in the fight and\nprovided a detailed account of Meskan‘s involvement. Weston‘s testimony was\n\n\n                                               8\n\fcorroborated by a neighborhood resident who witnessed the fight and identified Meskan\nas one of the assailants. The witness testified he ―wasn‘t completely sure‖ about his line-\nup identification because ―it was dark,‖ but expressed no hesitation when identifying\nMeskan at trial as one of the men who was ―kicking and punching the Latin guy in the\nmiddle of the street.‖ Viewing the evidence as a whole, any prosecutorial misconduct\nduring cross-examination was harmless because it is not ―reasonably probable that a\nresult more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of\nthe error.‖ (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836.)\n2. Evidence of defendant Meskan’s association with a racist group was properly admitted\nto prove hate crime allegations.\n       The prosecution alleged the assaults were hate crimes motivated by the Mexican\nvictims‘ race, ethnicity or national origin. The defense made an in limine motion to\nexclude evidence of Meskan‘s White supremacist gang affiliation as improper character\nevidence (Evid. Code, § 1101, subd. (a)) and unduly prejudicial (Evid. Code, § 352). The\nmotion was denied and that ruling is challenged on appeal.\n       In his opening statement to the jury, the prosecutor presaged evidence that Meskan\nis a skinhead who ―lives by the convict code‖ of racism. Police officers testified that\nMeskan identified himself as a skinhead when arrested in March 2009 and again in\nDecember 2010 when arrested for the present offense. Jail records were admitted\nshowing that Meskan said he was affiliated with the skinheads gang and was placed in\nadministrative segregation for being ―involved in gang recruitment by fear or force.‖\nWeston testified that Meskan and Allen expressed racist views consistent with the\n―racially charged environment‖ of prison and jail. 5 Weston nevertheless insisted that\nMeskan is not a skinhead and that the assaults were not racially motivated.\n\n\n\n5\n        Weston explained that, in prison, people of different races ―don‘t share food. If there was\n[a] bowl of food that person was to eat, and you were to eat after [him], [you] don‘t share open\nfood with people [of] other races. . . . [Y]ou don‘t share . . . bunks. You don‘t go in the same\ncells. You don‘t cell up with other races. . . . [S]mall amounts of business are allowed, you know,\nbut typically, especially in prison, in prison yards, you don‘t really comingle that much.‖\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       Evidence of Meskan‘s association with skinheads and racist views was properly\nadmitted to prove motive for the assaults and to substantiate the hate crime allegations.\nMeskan contends the evidence impugned his character and was more prejudicial than\nprobative because there is no ―direct link‖ between his behavior in prison and his\nbehavior when out of custody. He argues that a prisoner‘s ―behavior is dictated by a need\nto survive, to be safe, and to navigate the politics of the prison populations. That does not\nobtain when a person is free from custody.‖ However, evidence of affiliation with racist\ngroups and beliefs is highly relevant in a hate crime prosecution. The possible lack of\ncorrelation between a particular person‘s behavior when jailed or free may be argued to a\njury but does not render evidence of jail behavior inadmissible.\n       In any event, the disputed evidence did not prejudice Meskan. Meskan‘s concern\nthat the evidence ―evoke[d] a great emotional bias‖ that led to guilt by association is\nunfounded. The jury acquitted him of all hate crime charges. The evidence of his racist\nbeliefs and gang association did not have an inflammatory impact on the jury.\n3. The prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct during closing argument.\n       Meskan contends the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument\nby arguing facts not in evidence and by appealing to the passion and prejudice of the jury.\n       ―We review claims of prosecutorial misconduct pursuant to a settled standard.\n‗Under California law, a prosecutor commits reversible misconduct if he or she makes\nuse of ―deceptive or reprehensible methods‖ when attempting to persuade either the trial\ncourt or the jury, and it is reasonably probable that without such misconduct, an outcome\nmore favorable to the defendant would have resulted. [Citation.] Under the federal\nConstitution, conduct by a prosecutor that does not result in the denial of the defendant‘s\nspecific constitutional rights—such as a comment upon the defendant‘s invocation of the\nright to remain silent—but is otherwise worthy of condemnation, is not a constitutional\nviolation unless the challenged action ― ‗so infected the trial with unfairness as to make\nthe resulting conviction a denial of due process.‘ ‖ ‘ [Citations.] In addition, ‗ ―a\ndefendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely\nfashion—and on the same ground—the defendant made an assignment of misconduct and\n\n\n                                              10\n\frequested that the jury be admonished to disregard the impropriety. [Citation.]‖ ‘\n[Citation.] Objection may be excused if it would have been futile or an admonition would\nnot have cured the harm.‖ (People v. Dykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 760.)\n       a. Weston‘s plea bargain\n       Meskan claims the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence and ―misled the jury as\nto the terms of Mr. Weston‘s plea agreement and the reason he received the plea deal.‖\nWeston testified that he was promised credit for time served and probation in exchange\nfor pleading guilty, providing information on White supremacist groups and testifying at\ntrial. In cross-examining Weston, defense counsel suggested that Weston tailored his\ntestimony to obtain favorable treatment and implicated Meskan in the crimes because he\nwas angry with Meskan for having refused an earlier offer of three years in prison\ncontingent on all defendants pleading guilty.\n       The prosecutor responded by arguing that Weston cooperated with the prosecution\nbecause he felt that he, Meskan and Allen had ―gone too far‖ in beating the victims and\nshould have accepted responsibility by taking the joint plea bargain offered defendants,\nand ―because he showed some human decency on this night when no one else did.‖6\n\n6\n         The prosecutor said that, after punching and kicking the men, ―Anthony Weston thought,\nthis is too much. [¶] And you don‘t have to take his word for it. You can judge a man by his\nactions, because he just didn‘t think it. He acted on it. He looked there for a moment. He watched\nRobert [Allen] and Justin [Meskan] kicking these poor young Mayan cousins, and he decided it\nwas enough. He went back into the middle of the street, and he dragged the lifeless body of Alex\nout of the street, onto the sidewalk. . . . [¶] Officer Smith from the San Francisco Police\nDepartment . . . sees him pulling the victim out of the street. And that‘s why he got a deal,\nbecause he showed some human decency on this night when no one else did.‖ Defense counsel\nobjected that the statement was ―not supported by the record.‖ The objection was overruled.\n         The prosecutor continued his argument: ―Nobody else showed these poor victims any\ndecency. They fled. They fled . . . running from the police. Meskan first, Allen second.\n[¶] Weston stayed behind. The only reason he got detained on scene, the only reason he came\ninto our investigation so early, is because he had the human decency to stay behind, to drag\nAlex‘s body out of the street. [¶] So you can imagine that he would think that this isn‘t fair. I‘m\nwilling to do three years. I did the crime; I‘ll do the time. And the guys who ran away and,\nbecause they ran away, they didn‘t get stopped at the scene. They want to go to trial. They want\nto come and lie in court and say they weren‘t even there that night. And that made him mad, that\nthere was no loyalty, and there was no recognition for the fact that he was willing to say, no, on\nthis particular night. That‘s why he — that‘s why he got a deal.‖\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       Meskan says the prosecutor misled the jury in stating that Weston received a plea\ndeal ―because he showed some human decency‖ in carrying the victim from the street\nwhen, in fact, Weston received the deal for testifying against defendants. There is no\nreasonable likelihood the jury was misled. A copy of the plea bargain was admitted in\nevidence and its terms were explored at length during Weston‘s examination and cross-\nexamination. The jury knew Weston had to testify at defendants‘ trial to obtain the\nbenefits of the plea agreement. The jury was instructed to consider whether a witness‘s\ntestimony was influenced by bias or ―a personal interest in how the case is decided.‖\n(CALCRIM No. 226.) The jury was further advised that Weston was an accomplice to\nany assault and ―testimony of an accomplice that tends to incriminate the defendant\nshould be viewed with caution.‖ (CALCRIM No. 335.) In his closing argument, the\nprosecutor acknowledged that Weston‘s favorable sentence was conditioned upon his\ntestimony. The prosecutor‘s reference to Weston‘s ―human decency‖ as a motivating\nfactor for the plea offer was a minor point in a long explanation of why Weston was\noffered, and accepted, a plea bargain.\n       b. The convict code\n       The prosecutor argued: ―Anthony Weston told you that [Meskan and Allen]\nsubscribed to the convict code. They don‘t eat with Blacks. They don‘t share food. They\ndon‘t cross racial lines. And that‘s what drove them on this night. When they saw Weston\ntake a punch, they followed the convict code and jumped in a group beating.‖ An\nunspecified objection was made and discussed off the record. The statement was allowed\nto stand. Meskan claims the statement lacks factual support and constitutes prosecutorial\nmisconduct.\n       There was no misconduct. ―The prosecution is given wide latitude during closing\nargument to vigorously argue its case and to comment fairly on the evidence, including\nby drawing reasonable inferences from it.‖ (People v. Lee (2011) 51 Cal.4th 620, 647.)\nWeston testified that Meskan and Allen expressed racist views consistent with the\n―racially charged environment‖ of prison and jail where the races do not share food, bunk\ntogether or socialize. From this evidence, the prosecutor could fairly argue that racial\n\n\n                                             12\n\fself-segregation by inmates is a ―convict code‖ and that those adhering to it would be\nmotivated to join their friend in a cross-racial altercation.\n       c. San Francisco\n       Meskan contends the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passion and prejudice\nof the jury by invoking the community‘s racial tolerance in his closing remarks. The\nprosecutor argued, over objection, ―This isn‘t Alabama. This is San Francisco. You\nknow, I have a vision for San Francisco. . . . San Francisco is a town that welcomes our\nhard working immigrants. San Francisco is a town that can celebrate a Good Samaritan\nwho would jump to save a stranger. San Francisco is a city where somebody can be\nredeemed, Anthony Weston, when they drag a victim out of the street, and then confess\nto their crimes. Hate prejudice has no place in San Francisco. . . . I finish by asking you,\non behalf of Alex and Omar, on behalf of our town, on behalf of the City of San\nFrancisco, . . . I ask for justice for Alex and Omar.‖\n       A prosecutor may properly refer to ―the jury as the ‗conscience of the community‘\nor as representatives of the community.‖ (People v. Ledesma (2006) 39 Cal.4th 641, 741.)\nA prosecutor may not, however, ― ‗make arguments to the jury that give it the impression\nthat ―emotion may reign over reason,‖ and to present ―irrelevant information or\ninflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury‘s attention from its proper role, or invites an\nirrational, purely subjective response.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Redd (2010) 48 Cal.4th 691, 742.)\nNor may a prosecutor ―suggest that jurors consider public opinion in deciding guilt.‖ or\n― ‗urge jurors to convict a criminal defendant in order to protect community values,\npreserve civil order, or deter future lawbreaking.‘ The evil lurking in such prosecutorial\nappeals is that the defendant will be convicted for reasons wholly irrelevant to his own\nguilt or innocence. Jurors may be persuaded by such appeals to believe that, by\nconvicting a defendant, they will assist in the solution of some pressing social\nproblem. . . . [¶] But a request that the jury ―condemn‖ an accused for engaging in illegal\nactivities is not constitutionally infirm, so long as it is not calculated to excite prejudice\nor passion.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 743, fn. 25.)\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f       The prosecutor‘s brief reference to his ―vision‖ of San Francisco as a place\nwithout race-based hatred was not likely to divert the jury from its duty to weigh the\nevidence rationally. The remark came at the end of a long, 37-page closing argument that\nthoroughly reviewed the evidence and applicable legal principles. Race hatred was an\nelement of the charged crimes and the subject of extensive trial testimony. An eyewitness\ntestified that the words he heard during the attack, like ―White power‖ and ―fucking\nspics,‖ is ―[j]ust stuff you don‘t hear in San Francisco.‖ When read in context, the\nprosecutor‘s argument was not a ― ‗deceptive or reprehensible method[]‘ ‖ used to\npersuade the jury to abandon reason for passion. (People v. Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 760.) To whatever extent the prosecutor‘s closing remarks may have strayed outside\nthe proper scope of argument, there was no prejudice. As previously indicated, Meskan\nwas acquitted of all hate crime charges.\n4. Meskan’s failure to dispute imposition of a booking fee forfeits the claim on appeal.\n       The trial court imposed a $135 jail booking fee without an express finding of\nMeskan‘s financial ability to pay the fee. (Gov. Code, § 29550.2.) Meskan contends the\ncourt erred by imposing the fee without the proper findings and maintains there is no\nevidence to support his ability to pay or the actual administrative cost of booking. The\nAttorney General correctly asserts that Meskan forfeited his claims by failing to object in\nthe trial court to imposition of the fee. ―[A] defendant who does nothing to put at issue\nthe propriety of imposition of a booking fee forfeits the right to challenge the sufficiency\nof the evidence to support imposition of the booking fee on appeal.‖ (People v.\nMcCullough (2013) 56 Cal.4th 589, 598.) ― ‗[I]t is both unfair and inefficient to permit a\nclaim of error on appeal that, if timely brought to the attention of the trial court, could\nhave been easily corrected or avoided.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 593.)\nB. Robert Allen’s appeal\n1. The prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct in his opening statement.\n       Allen contends the prosecutor‘s opening statement was unsupported by the record\nand appealed to passion and prejudice. The prosecutor‘s statement does contain several\ninaccuracies and rhetorical flourishes but no use of ― ‗deceptive or reprehensible methods\n\n\n                                              14\n\fto persuade the jury‘ ‖ amounting to prejudicial misconduct. (People v. Williams (2013)\n56 Cal.4th 630, 671.)\n       a. The victim‘s work\n       During opening statement, the prosecutor said the evidence would show that Alex\nCauich ―works 100 hours a week, and he sends every penny he can back home.‖ Allen\ncomplains the statement was ―not born[e] out by the evidence he would present.‖ Alex\ntestified that he works ―about 50 hours a week‖ and was never asked if he sends money\nhome. There does not appear to be any deliberate effort to mislead the jury. The\nprosecutor may have overstated Alex‘s work hours because he thought Alex worked 50\nhours at each of two restaurant locations rather than 50 hours total.7 The prosecutor may\nnever have asked Alex if he sent money home because this line of questioning about\nAlex‘s life and work habits drew numerous relevancy objections. The prosecutor‘s\nassertion that Alex ―sends every penny he can back home‖ had some basis in the fact that\nAlex seemed to live below his means, in a residential hotel room with two other men. To\nthe extent the prosecutor‘s statement was an improper appeal for victim sympathy, as the\ndefense now asserts, it was a small impropriety without prejudicial impact.\n       b. The victim heard an ethnic epithet.\n       The prosecutor said Alex would testify that, while waiting for his cousin outside\nthe Nite Cap Bar, ―he hears somebody make an anti-Latino epithet towards him,\nsomething along the lines of, you fucking Latino. And then the next thing he knows, he‘s\npunched in the middle of the forehead.‖ This differed slightly from Alex‘s trial\ntestimony. Alex testified he was punched in the face and ―maybe‖ heard someone say\nsomething at the moment of impact but ―got punched so hard‖ that he does not\n―remember any exact words.‖ There is no indication that the prosecutor misstated the\n\n7\n         The prosecutor‘s direct examination of Alex suggests this possible misunderstanding:\n―Q. . . . [I]n a one-week period, how many hours a week do you work? . . . [¶] [A.] Well, I‘m just\nworking too much. I maybe work about 50 hours a week. [¶] [Q.] And do you have more than\none job? [¶] A. Yes. I‘m working with the same company. Two jobs, but with the same\ncompany. [¶] Q. Okay. Is the 50 hours a week at the one location, or is [it] at both locations?\n[¶] A. No. At both locations.‖\n\n\n                                               15\n\fexpected testimony. The prosecutor seems to have thought Alex would testify to hearing\nan ethnic epithet because the prosecutor pressed Alex on direct examination to recount\nwhat he heard. Alex testified with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter and may have\nhad difficulty recounting words spoken in English. The minor discrepancy between what\nthe prosecutor said Alex would testify, and what he did testify is immaterial. While Alex\ncould not recall what was said, other witnesses substantiated the prosecutor‘s\nrepresentation that ethnic epithets were spoken during the attack.\n       c. ―Wife-beater‖ undershirt\n       Allen contends the prosecutor wrongly appealed to the passion and prejudice of\nthe jury by saying Allen was arrested at the scene of the crime ―wearing a very distinctive\nwhite wife beater—you‘re going to hear that come up again and again, a distinctive white\nwife beater shirt.‖ This slang term for a tank top undershirt was used by two different\ntrial witnesses. An eyewitness to the street fight said one man ―was doing a majority of\nthe kicking‖ and described that man as ―wearing a white, like undershirt, like tank top. I\nthink they call them wife beaters.‖ Another eyewitness, when asked what the White men\nwere wearing, said ―[l]ike button up t-shirts, and a couple of them had a wife beater on.‖\nThe prosecutor did not commit misconduct by introducing the jury to a slang term\nemployed by witnesses in the case.\n       d. Skinhead groups\n       The prosecutor told the jury Weston would testify that he accepted a cooperation\nagreement with the prosecution because he owed no loyalty to Meskan and Allen after\nthey refused ―a fair deal‖ for a joint plea and ―[m]ore importantly, he‘s going to tell you\nabout the second reason that he took this deal. And the second reason is because he‘s\ntired of this lifestyle. He‘s tired of the drugs. He‘s tired of the violence. He‘s tired of the\nbad influences, the bad influences in his life. And he realized he needed to make a clean\nbreak. And his participation as a prosecution witness is much more than just coming to\ncourt and telling you these are the two guys who [did] it. [¶] It‘s much more than that. He\nhas turned his back on the entire lifestyle. He‘s going to tell you that he used to be a\nskinhead. And he‘s going to tell you that, as part of the deal, he‘s given the prosecution,\n\n\n                                               16\n\fhe‘s given law enforcement information. That‘s part of the deal. And you‘ll see a copy of\nthe deal that we reached with Mr. Weston. He‘s naming names. [¶] He‘s told us about the\nthree active skinhead groups operating here.. . . He‘s named 40 names of the active\nskinhead leadership here in this city. And he‘s told us what they‘re doing, what they‘re\ninvolved in. . . . I was going to tell you that the skinhead movement is growing here in\nSan Francisco because of realignment, because people who used to go to state prison are\nnow going to county jail. He‘s going to tell you that people are coming to San Francisco,\nbecause, in his words, if . . . you‘ve got a bag of speed in San Mateo County, you‘re\ngoing to state prison. If you got a bag of speed in San Francisco, you‘re going to be sent\nto a drug program.‖\n       Allen contends the prosecutor presented ―inflammatory rhetoric to the jury‖ that\n―hoards of drug-dealing skinheads were headed for San Francisco‖ without evidentiary\nsupport for the assertions. The references to a growing skinhead movement because of\nlenient drug crime sentencing was unsubstantiated and improper. Most of the\nprosecutor‘s address to the jury, however, was an accurate summarization of Weston‘s\ntestimony and relevant to the hate crime allegations. Weston said there are ―a lot of\ndifferent types of skinheads‖ and ―they consider themselves a movement, not a gang.‖ He\ntestified that he was affiliated with the skinheads for about four years but was no longer a\n―member‖ because he ―was tired of prison and crime and drugs‖ and did not ―want to be\ninvolved in this type of life style anymore.‖ Weston testified that he identified skinhead\ngroups as part of his plea agreement, consistent with the prosecutor‘s opening statement.\n       We reject Allen‘s contention that all ―evidence and argument about skinhead\ngangs . . . was not relevant‖ because there was no allegation that the crimes were\ncommitted to benefit a gang. While no gang enhancements were alleged, there were\nallegations that the assaults were hate crimes motivated by the victims‘ race, ethnicity or\nnational origin. Evidence of Weston‘s and Meskan‘s affiliation with a racist group like\nthe skinheads was highly relevant to the hate crime allegations. Allen argues that the\nprosecutor‘s discussion of skinhead groups wrongly insinuated that Allen was a gang\nmember. But the prosecutor did not mention Allen when summarizing Weston‘s former\n\n\n                                             17\n\fassociation with skinheads. Nothing in the prosecutor‘s summarization contradicted\nWeston‘s testimony that Allen expressed racist views but was not a member of the\nskinheads. Viewed as a whole, the prosecutor‘s statements about skinhead groups were\nproper. The unsubstantiated remark about the skinhead movement growing in San\nFrancisco because of realignment and lenient drug crime sentencing was a minor\nimpropriety without prejudicial impact. ―Although defendant singles out words and\nphrases, or at most a few sentences, to demonstrate misconduct, we must view the\nstatements in the context of the argument as a whole.‖ (People v. Dennis (1998) 17\nCal.4th 468, 522.)\n       e. Runic writings\n       Allen asserts the prosecutor falsely attributed runic writings to him. The\nprosecutor told the jury the police searched Allen‘s apartment and ―located paper work\nwithin Robert Allen‘s school paper work. And on this paper work, there‘s runic writings.\nYou‘re going to hear from witnesses that runic writings are used by White supremacists.\n[¶] It‘s claimed by White supremacists, who trace it back to the Nazis, who saw runic\nwriting as a descendent—as the origin of the Germanic language. And on this page that\nlists all the runic alphabet and all the English alphabet, so you can translate one to the\nother, you‘ll see words on this page. And one of the words, one of the phrases that you‘ll\nsee translated into runic, is White power, the very phrase that was yelled during this\nassault.‖\n       Trial testimony largely supports the prosecutor‘s statements. Sergeant Schwarz-\nChoy testified she found a piece of paper with runic writing among loose papers in a box\nlocated in a closet in Allen‘s apartment. The closet contained other papers, including\nhandwritten homework bearing Allen‘s name. The runic writing was therefore found in a\ncloset shared with Allen‘s school paperwork rather than, as the prosecutor said, ―within\nRobert Allen‘s school paper work.‖ The difference is minor and inconsequential. The\nprosecutor‘s assertion that ―runic writings are used by White supremacists‖ is fully\nsupported by the record. Weston testified that skinheads use runic writing as a secret\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\flanguage and the runic writing located in Allen‘s apartment contained the phrase ―White\npower.‖\n       f. Kicks to the victims‘ heads\n       Allen argues the evidence does not support the prosecutor‘s statement that he and\nMeskan ―brutally kicked [the victims] in the head while they‘re down on the ground.‖\nThe statement is well supported by the evidence. Weston testified that Allen and Meskan\nkicked Alex and that a resident saw Alex on the ground surrounded by men who\n―repeatedly kicked [him] in the face.‖ Omar testified that three men threw him to the\nground and punched and kicked him in the head and back. The opening statement\nmatched the evidence presented.\n2. The prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct in his closing statement.\n       a. Interactions with Mott\n       A witness who lives near the Nite Cap Bar testified that he saw a group of people\nthat looked like skinheads talking to a bar regular named ―Mott‖ just before the assault.\nThe resident described Mott as ―the neighborhood skinhead‖ and said he and Weston\n―had similar tattoos‖ and were talking together. In closing argument, the prosecutor\nargued the assaults were hate crimes and interpreted the interaction between Weston‘s\ngroup and Mott as ―checking . . . in with [Mott] to get the play call.‖ The prosecutor\nargued: ―These two Mexicans wandered into the wrong bar. [Mott] . . . the resident\nskinhead made a call. And these guys were the enforcers.‖\n       Allen argues the prosecutor ―urged the jury to draw the unreasonable inference\nthat Mott had passed orders‖ to defendants ―to go beat up Mexicans‖ when there was no\nevidence that Mott was directing defendants‘ actions. There was no misconduct.\n―Prosecutors have wide latitude to discuss and draw inferences from the evidence at trial.\n[Citation.] Whether the inferences the prosecutor draws are reasonable is for the jury to\ndecide.‖ (People v. Dennis, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 522.) The jury here appears to have\nfound the inference unreasonable. The jury acquitted defendants of hate crime charges\nand thus, even if the remarks were improper, they were not prejudicial.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       b. Allen as a ―skinhead wannabe‖\n       Allen says he was wrongly referred to as a ―skinhead wannabe‖ during closing\nargument when ―there was no evidence that Allen has aspirations to become either a\nskinhead or Nazi.‖ In referring to Allen, the prosecutor said: ―[W]e‘ve put in no evidence\nthat he‘s a skinhead. That‘s not what we‘re alleging here. But what we‘re saying is, he\nlikes hanging out with them, right? He hangs out with folks like Richard Trietsch, who\nhas a swastika tattooed on his leg. He lived with Richard Trietsch in Daly City and\ninvited Richard Trietsch into his home in San Francisco. [¶] Inspector Choy told you that,\nas soon as she walks into Allen‘s apartment at 850 Geary, the first thing that you see in\nthe common area of the hallway is a photograph of Richard Trietsch saluting before a\nNazi flag.‖ The prosecutor recalled Weston‘s testimony that Allen held racist views and\nthen proceeded to describe the assault: ―[T]here were a lot of actions which show that this\nwas a hate assault. Allen was the loudest one. He‘s the wannabe. That‘s what I keep\nreferring to him as. He wants to prove himself to the skinheads, to the Nazis.‖\n       The prosecutor‘s argument was a fair comment upon the evidence and the\ninferences to be drawn from it. There was no testimony that Allen wanted to prove\nhimself to the skinheads, as Allen notes on appeal, but the prosecutor was free to argue\nthat the evidence of Allen‘s racist views, close association with White supremacists and\nprominent display of Nazi décor in his apartment supported the inference that Allen was a\nskinhead ―wannabe.‖\n       c. Comments about defense counsel.\n       Allen claims the prosecutor twice used his closing argument to disparage defense\ncounsel. ―Personal attacks on opposing counsel are improper and irrelevant to the issues.‖\n(People v. Sandoval (1992) 4 Cal.4th 155, 184.) Here, the prosecutor‘s remark that\ndefense counsel ―echoed‖ defendants‘ view that the victims ―didn‘t belong‖ was\nimproper, but any harm was obviated by the court‘s swift action in striking the statement.\n       The other disputed remark concerns the prosecutor‘s rebuttal to defense counsel‘s\naccusation that the prosecution engaged in an ―egregious . . . manipulation of evidence‖\nin presenting to the jury a photograph of a Hitler screensaver on one of the computers\n\n\n                                            20\n\fseized from Allen‘s apartment rather than the computer itself. The defense claimed the\ncomputer with the Hitler screensaver belonged to someone else and the second computer\nbelonged to Allen. To prove its point, the defense brought the second computer to court,\nturned it on, and showed that the screensaver was a photograph of Allen. Defense counsel\nargued that the prosecutor could have done the same but did not because it would\ncontradict his theory of the case. Defense counsel called upon the jury to defend the\nconstitution and ―stand between an overzealous government and the people who live\nhere.‖\n         In rebuttal, the prosecutor said defense counsel ―waived the American flag and\ntalked to you about how important . . . our constitutional rights are. And then they want to\ncome back and say, well, why didn‘t we turn on the computer? The inspector told you the\nreason. She told you that we‘re not allowed to do that. It requires a search warrant.‖ The\nprosecutor said the defense should not ―blame us for not turning on the computer here in\nthe courtroom, when we would violate constitutional rights. We are not allowed to do\nthat.‖\n         Allen argues that the prosecutor wrongly ―berated‖ defense counsel for ―waiv[ing]\nthe American flag.‖ The prosecutor‘s argument was not a personal attack upon defense\ncounsel but a fair response to issues raised by the defense. Allen asserts that the\nprosecutor‘s response, even if not a personal attack, was misconduct because the response\nwas legally incorrect in asserting that the prosecutor could not turn on the computer\nwithout obtaining a search warrant. The point is immaterial because the jury was not\nlikely to be misled by the attorneys‘ pointed exchange over the handling of computer\nevidence. The computer was turned on and the jury could draw its own conclusion about\nownership.\n3. Evidence of Allen’s skinhead associations and Nazi paraphernalia seized from his\napartment was properly admitted to prove hate crime allegations.\n         Allen claims the computer with a Hitler screensaver and a paper and hammer with\nrunic writing seized from his apartment were wrongly admitted to prove his character. He\nfurther claims that evidence of the racist views of Weston, Meskan and Trietsch ―was\n\n\n                                             21\n\firrelevant and highly prejudicial.‖ The evidence was properly admitted. As explained in\nconnection with Meskan‘s appeal, evidence of Allen‘s association with skinheads and\nracist views was properly admitted to prove motive for the assaults and to substantiate the\nhate crime allegations.\n4. The court properly admitted limited evidence regarding gangs.\n       The court admitted evidence that Meskan identified himself to jailers as a skinhead\nwhen arrested in March 2009 and again in December 2010 when arrested for the present\noffense. Allen argues that ―evidence of gangs is highly prejudicial‖ and negatively\nimpacted his case despite the prosecutor‘s clear acknowledgment in closing argument\nthat there is ―no evidence that [Allen is] a skinhead.‖ The limited evidence was properly\nadmitted and not prejudicial. The jury was not misled to think Allen was a gang member\nor disposed to White supremacist gang violence. The jury acquitted defendants of all hate\ncrime allegations.\n5. Allen’s battery conviction does not violate the double jeopardy clause.\n       As noted above, Allen was convicted of two counts relating to Alex: (1) assault by\nmeans of force likely to cause great bodily injury (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) with personal\ninfliction of great bodily injury (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)) and (2) battery with personal\ninfliction of serious bodily injury (§ 243, subd. (d)). Execution of sentence on the battery\ncount was stayed because the assault and battery arose from the same course of conduct.\n(§ 654.)\n       Allen contends that staying punishment on the battery conviction is insufficient\nand that the conviction must be vacated because it violates the double jeopardy clause.\nHe mistakes the scope of the clause. The double jeopardy clause provides that no ―person\n[shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.‖ (U.S.\nConst., 5th Amend.) ―The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple\ncriminal punishments for the same offense, [citations], and then only when such occurs in\nsuccessive proceedings.‖ (Hudson v. United States (1997) 522 U.S. 93, 99, italics\naltered.) In a single trial, the double jeopardy clause does no ―more than prevent the\nsentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the Legislature intended.‖\n\n\n                                             22\n\f(Missouri v. Hunter (1983) 459 U.S. 359, 366.) ―Federal law, like California statutory\nlaw, clearly recognizes that cumulative punishment may be imposed under two statutes,\neven where they proscribe the same conduct, if the legislature has specifically authorized\ncumulative punishment.‖ (People v. Sloan (2007) 42 Cal.4th 110, 121.)\n       The California Legislature has specifically authorized multiple conviction.\n(§ 954.) However, ― ‗[a] judicially created exception to the general rule permitting\nmultiple conviction ―prohibits multiple convictions based on necessarily included\noffenses.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 116.) ― ‗[O]nly a statutorily lesser\nincluded offense is subject to the bar against multiple convictions in the same\nproceeding.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 118, italics added.) Allen‘s conviction for battery with personal\ninfliction of serious bodily injury is not a statutorily lesser included offense to assault by\nmeans of force likely to cause great bodily injury. It is only the assault‘s enhancement for\nactual infliction of great bodily injury (deemed equivalent to serious bodily injury)8 that\nbrings the elements of the two offenses into alignment. But enhancements may not be\nconsidered when determining if one offense is a necessarily included offense of another\noffense. (Id. at p. 114.) ―In deciding whether multiple conviction is proper, a court should\nconsider only the statutory elements‖ of the substantive offenses. (Id. at p. 118.)\n       While multiple conviction for the same course of conduct is generally permitted,\nmultiple punishment generally is not. (People v. Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 116.)\nSection 654, subdivision (a) provides: ―An act or omission that is punishable in different\nways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides\nfor the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be\npunished under more than one provision.‖ Where, as here, a defendant is convicted of\ntwo offenses arising from the same course of conduct, the court stays execution of\nsentence on the offense with the shorter term of imprisonment. (People v. Sloan, supra, at\np. 116.) The court properly applied these principles here.\n\n\n8\n       ― ‗ ―[S]erious bodily‖ injury is the essential equivalent of ―great bodily injury‖ ‘ ‖ for\nmost purposes. (People v. Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 117.)\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n     The judgments are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                            _________________________\n                                            Pollak, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nMcGuiness, P.

Defendants were each sentenced to eight\nyears in prison. Defendants raise multiple issues in separate appeals, which are\nconsolidated for review. Meskan claims the prosecutor used suggestive questioning\nduring cross-examination to introduce testimonial statements of an absent witness in\nviolation of defendant‘s right to confront witnesses against him. Meskan and Allen claim\nprosecutorial misconduct during opening and closing statements to the jury; wrongful\nadmission of evidence linking defendants with White supremacist groups; and sentencing\nerrors. We find no prejudicial error and shall affirm the judgments.\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f                              STATEMENT OF FACTS\n       On the night of November 9, 2010, cousins Alex Cauich-Dzul and Jose Omar\nCauich went to the Nite Cap Bar in San Francisco‘s Tenderloin District.1 Alex and Omar\nare Mexican nationals. Alex testified that he left the bar and was standing on the sidewalk\nwaiting for Omar when someone came up to him and punched him in the face. A second\npunch landed immediately after the first, and he lost consciousness and fell to the ground.\nOmar looked out the bar‘s window to see Alex on the ground being punched and kicked\nby five White men. Omar ran from the bar, beer bottle in hand, to defend his cousin and\nwas himself punched and kicked by the men.\n       A neighborhood resident saw the group confront Omar. The witness heard\nsomeone in the group of White men yell, ―why don‘t you run across the street, you\nfucking spics, like you run across the border.‖ One of the White men then punched Omar.\nAnother man took the beer bottle from Omar‘s hand and hit him on the head with it.\nOmar fell to the ground. The White men ―kicked . . . stomped and punched‖ Omar ―for a\nlong period of time‖ while yelling ―White power‖ and ―fucking spics.‖\n       The police arrived on the scene in a patrol car with lights on and the siren\nsounding. An officer saw Alex, bloodied and ―semi-unconscious,‖ being dragged from\nthe street to the sidewalk by Omar and another man. The man assisting Alex then walked\naway and was seen near another man leaving the scene. Omar said the two men had been\nin the group of attackers and the police detained them. They were identified as Anthony\nWeston, who had assisted Alex, and defendant Allen. Weston was released and Allen was\narrested.\n       Several hours later the police conducted a search of Allen‘s apartment, located on\nGeary Street only blocks from the bar. Allen lived with Weston and another man, Richard\nTrietsch, and the two were home at the time of the search. When the police investigator\nentered the studio apartment, she saw taped to the wall a photograph depicting Trietsch\n\n1\n       Given a shared family name, we use the men‘s chosen first names: Alex and Omar. Omar\nwas in Mexico at the time of trial and unavailable to testify. A transcript of his preliminary\nhearing testimony was read to the jury.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fsaluting a swastika flag. Trietsch has a swastika tattoo on his leg. A walk-in closet was\nsearched and found to contain school work with Allen‘s handwritten name, paperwork\nbelonging to Trietsch, and a hammer. The police found a paper that appeared to be a code\nkey with runic writing set next to the English alphabet and coded phrases that, when\ntranslated, read ―White power,‖ ―sick man‖ and ―Trietsch.‖ The runic alphabet is used by\nskinheads as a secret language. The hammer had ―sick man‖ etched on it in runic code.\nTrietsch said the hammer belonged to him. Four computers were found during the police\nsearch. The police seized two of the computers, which they believed belonged to Allen.\nOne of the seized computers had ―pictures of Hitler and swastikas‖ as desktop wallpaper\nor a screen saver.\n       Three men were charged with a racially motivated attack: Weston and defendants\nAllen and Meskan, whom Weston identified as his accomplices. Weston had been friends\nwith Allen and Meskan for years before the incident. Weston pleaded guilty and agreed\nto cooperate with the prosecution in exchange for a grant of probation.\n       Weston testified that on the day of the street fight he began drinking when he\nawoke in the morning. Later that day, he went out drinking with Allen and Meskan. The\nmen returned to the Geary Street apartment late at night where they joined Trietsch and\ncontinued drinking. Meskan decided to go home and the other men walked with him,\nintending to ―hit bars on the way.‖ The four men were walking toward the Nite Cap Bar\nwhen they saw Alex. Weston‘s trial account differs from Alex‘s testimony of an\nunprovoked attack. Weston claimed that Alex bumped into him and Allen while crossing\nthe street. Weston sarcastically said, ―excuse me,‖ and Alex reportedly responded by\nsaying ―fuck you‖ or ―something to that effect‖ and raised his hands ―like he wanted to\nfight.‖ Weston punched Alex in the face. Weston is five feet eleven inches tall. Alex is\nabout five feet three inches tall. Alex was stumbling backwards from Weston‘s blow\nwhen Meskan came up and punched Alex in the face. Alex fell to the ground, landing in\nthe middle of the street. Meskan and Allen kicked Alex several times as he lay in the\nstreet. Weston did not see Trietsch strike Alex.\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\f       According to Weston, Omar then ran up to the group with a beer bottle in his\nhand. Weston knocked the bottle from his hand and hit him. Omar fell against a parked\ntruck and Meskan punched Omar, knocking him to the ground. Weston kicked Omar\nonce then ―kind of felt like [Omar] had had enough.‖ Weston saw that Alex was still\nlying in the street and, with another man, dragged Alex to the sidewalk. Weston heard\npolice sirens and started to make his ―get away‖ but was detained by the police, along\nwith Allen. Meskan was walking further ahead and was not stopped.\n       At trial, Weston insisted that the beating of Alex and Omar was not racially\nmotivated. Weston denied being a racist although he admitted being ―affiliated‖ with\nwhite supremacist ―skinhead‖ groups in the past and having the word ―skin‖ tattooed on\nhis side. Weston said Allen and Meskan were not skinheads, that the computer seized\nfrom the Geary Street apartment with the Hitler screen saver belonged to Trietsch, not\nAllen, and that Trietsch is a White supremacist. Weston denied hearing any racial slurs\nduring the street fight. Weston did see Allen raise his hands in the air at the end of the\nfight and say something like ―this is our town.‖\n       Meskan testified and denied being present at the street fight. Meskan said he was\nwith his girlfriend until about 10:00 p.m. and then at home alone watching television. On\ncross-examination, Meskan admitted that he identified himself to jailers as a skinhead\nwhen arrested in March 2009 and again in December 2010 when arrested for the present\noffense. The prosecutor questioned Meskan about a conversation he had with Heather\nWilliams, a friend of Meskan‘s girlfriend, who did not testify at trial. The prosecutor\nasked Meskan if he told Williams he had ―been in a drunken brawl‖ at the Nite Cap Bar\n―with a couple of Mexicans.‖ Meskan denied making such a statement.\n\n                           VERDICT AND SENTENCING\n       The jury convicted defendants of (1) assault upon Alex by means of force likely to\ncause great bodily injury (Pen. Code, § 245, subd. (a)(1))2 with personal infliction of\ngreat bodily injury (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)); (2) simple assault upon Omar (§ 240) (a lesser\n2\n       All further section references are to the Penal Code except as noted.\n\n\n                                                4\n\fincluded offense to the charged crime of aggravated assault); and (3) battery upon Alex\nwith personal infliction of serious bodily injury (§ 243, subd. (d)). The jury found not true\nallegations that the assaults and battery were hate crimes committed because of the\nvictims‘ race, ethnicity or national origin. In a separate proceeding, the court found\ndefendants had prior prison commitments. (§ 667.5, subd. (b).)\n       The court sentenced each defendant to eight years in prison: the upper term of\nfour years for the assault upon Alex with a three-year enhancement for inflicting great\nbodily injury plus one year for a prior prison commitment. Sentence for the battery upon\nAlex was stayed. (§ 654.) A concurrent county jail term of six months was imposed for\nthe assault upon Omar.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\nA Justin Meskan’s appeal\n1. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct when cross-examining defendant Meskan.\n       Meskan claims the prosecutor committed misconduct by asking suggestive\nquestions about a conversation with Heather Williams when Williams was unavailable as\na witness to corroborate the statements attributed to him by the questions. The prosecutor\nasked Meskan if he told Williams he had been in a drunken brawl with a couple\nMexicans, and Meskan denied making such a statement.3 Meskan argues that the line of\n\n\n3\n         The disputed cross-examination was as follows: ―Q. Do you know an individual by the\nname of Heather Williams? [¶] A. Yes. [¶] Q. How long have you known her for? [¶] A. Can‘t\nsay exactly. Maybe two or three years, maybe. [¶] [Defense Counsel:] I‘m going to object to this\nas irrelevant, your Honor. [¶] The Court: Overruled. [¶] Q. . . . Would you consider her to be a\ngood friend? [¶] No. [¶] Q . . . In November of 2010, how often would you socialize or speak\nwith Heather Williams? [¶] A. She was Lindsey‘s [Meskan‘s girlfriend] best friend. So, I mean, I\nwould see her frequently, you know, here and there, but not a good friend, no. [¶] Q. And after\nthis incident was reported to you, . . . you talked with Lindsey – [¶] [Defense Counsel:] Your\nHonor, I‘m going to object to this specifically in light of earlier proceedings in this case. [¶] The\nCourt: . . . What is your question, Mr. [Prosecutor]? [¶] Q. . . . You spoke with Lindsey Powell\nand Heather Williams about your involvement in this case? [¶] [Defense Counsel]: That‘s my\nobjection, Your Honor. [¶] The Court: Overruled. He may answer. [¶] [A.] There is no\ninvolvement in this case. [¶] Q. . . . Okay. Specifically, one week after this incident, you met in\nperson with Heather Williams while you guys were taking care of Robert Allen‘s effects?\n[¶] A. Yeah. I met her to, um, put all the stuff in storage, yeah. [¶] Q. Okay. And, at that time,\n\n                                                 5\n\fquestioning effectively introduced Williams‘s testimonial statements without an\nopportunity for cross-examination in violation of his right to confront witnesses against\nhim. (Crawford v. Washington (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59.) He also contends ― ‗ ―[i]t was\nimproper to ask questions which clearly suggested the existence of facts which would\nhave been harmful to defendant, in the absence of a good faith belief by the prosecutor\nthat the questions would be answered in the affirmative, or with a belief on his part that\nthe facts could be proved, and a purpose to prove them, if their existence should be\ndenied.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Mooc (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1233; quoting People v.

Washington, supra, 541 U.S. at p. 59), no testimonial\nstatements of an absent witness were presented here. Defendant was twice asked if he\nmade statements to Williams, which he denied. Defendant argues that ―the prosecutor‘s\nquestions relayed to the jurors the substance of Ms. Williams[‘s] out-of-court statements\nthat appellant admitted to her that he was involved in a bar fight with Mexican men.‖ But\na prosecutor‘s questions are not evidence. (People v. Samayoa (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n843-844.) The jury was clearly instructed on this point at both the start and end of trial:\n― ‗Evidence‘ is the sworn testimony of witnesses, the exhibits admitted into evidence, and\nanything else [the court] told [the jury] to consider as evidence. Nothing that the\nattorneys say is evidence. . . . Their questions are not evidence. Only the witnesses‘\nanswers are evidence. The attorneys‘ questions are significant only if they helped you to\nunderstand the witnesses‘ answers. Do not assume that something is true just because one\n\n\nyou told her that you had been engaged in a drunken brawl at the Nite Cap Bar? [¶] A. That was\nnever said. [¶] Q. Okay. And you told her, at that time, that you had just been in a drunken brawl\nwith a couple of Mexicans? [¶] A. That was never said. [¶] Q. Okay. Does Heather Williams\nhave it out for you? [¶] A. I don‘t think so. [¶] Q. Okay. Can you think of any reason why she\nwould go tell the police that? [¶] [Defense Counsel:] Well, I‘m going to object to that. That‘s\nassuming facts not in evidence, Your Honor. [¶] . . . [¶] And it‘s hearsay as well. [¶] The Court:\nOverruled. But I‘ll sustain the objection based on speculation.‖\n\n\n                                                6\n\fof the attorneys asked a question that suggested it was true.‖ (CALCRIM No. 222, italics\nadded.). The prosecutor‘s questions did not introduce testimonial evidence in violation of\nMeskan‘s right to confront witnesses against him.\n       Also unavailing is defendant‘s contention that the prosecutor lacked a proper basis\nfor asking defendant about his conversation with Williams and ―engaged in a deliberate\nattempt to put inadmissible and prejudicial evidence before the jury.‖ The prosecutor had\na factual basis for asking about the conversation, the substance of which was not\ninadmissible. At the preliminary hearing, a police officer testified that Williams reported\na conversation with Weston and Meskan in which they admitted being ―in a fight with a\ncouple of Mexicans.‖ Williams was called as a witness at the preliminary hearing and\nconfirmed that Meskan told her ―[h]e was there, and then he got into a fight.‖ Williams\nwas a reluctant witness and after answering a few questions she invoked her right against\nself-incrimination, refusing to testify further. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)4 Meskan‘s\nattorney moved in limine to preclude the prosecutor from using Williams‘s preliminary\nhearing testimony, claiming there had been an inadequate opportunity for cross-\nexamination. The prosecutor said he did not intend to use the preliminary hearing\ntestimony and the motion was granted. The prosecutor called Williams as a witness at\ntrial but, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, she again refused to\ntestify. (U.S. Const., 5th Amend.) Consequently, when Meskan later testified and denied\ntelling Williams he had ―been in a drunken brawl with a couple of Mexicans,‖ the\nprosecutor was unable to call Williams to impeach his testimony.\n       The unavailability of impeaching evidence, however, does not establish\nprosecutorial misconduct in asking a question that was founded on prior testimony. There\nis, to be sure, danger in permitting a prosecutor to attribute statements to an absent third\nparty during cross-examination of a defendant. Such questions may suggest to jurors that\n―the prosecutor had a source of information unknown to them which corroborated the\ntruth of the matters in question. The rule is well established that the prosecuting attorney\n4\n        Counsel for Williams later explained that Williams might be found in violation of her\nparole if she admitted associating with Meskan.\n\n\n                                                7\n\fmay not interrogate witnesses solely ‗for the purpose of getting before the jury the facts\ninferred therein, together with the insinuations and suggestions they inevitably contained,\nrather than for the answers which might be given.‘ ‖ (People v. Wagner (1975) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1139504\"><a href=\"/opinion/1139504/people-v-wagner/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619.) On this record, however, we cannot say the prosecutor‘s question was asked in\nbad faith or that the trial court erroneously rejected defense allegations of bad faith. The\nprosecutor was not required to assume that defendant would deny making a statement\nthat the prosecutor had reasonable grounds to believe he had made. Consistent with\ndefendant‘s denial of involvement in the assault, he might just as well have answered that\nWilliams misunderstood his statement, that he made the statement in jest, or provided\nsome other explanation for making the statement although denying its truth.\n       Were there any impropriety in asking the questions, the jury instruction given here\nmakes it unlikely the jury was misled by any suggestion implicit in the questions. The\njury was cautioned in clear and explicit terms: ―Do not assume that something is true just\nbecause one of the attorneys asked a question that suggested it was true.‖ (CALCRIM\nNo. 222.) As a reviewing court, ―[w]e presume the jury obeyed the trial court‘s\ninstruction that questions posed by the attorneys are not evidence.‖ (People v. Hinton\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640466\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640466/people-v-hinton/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 864.) Defendant claims the presumption is rebutted here because\nthe jury sent a note to the court during deliberations requesting Meskan‘s cross-\nexamination testimony and the Williams police report. The note reflects the jury‘s\ninterest in the matter but also its focus on the truth of the matter in seeking the police\nreport as evidence of any statements attributed to Williams by the prosecutor‘s\nquestioning. The court responded to the jury‘s question: ―[t]he police report is not in\nevidence and cannot be considered during your deliberations.‖ Following the court‘s\nresponse, there is even less reason to assume that the jury disregarded the instructions and\nrelied upon statements implied in the prosecutor‘s questions.\n       Moreover, apart from any suggestion contained in the prosecutor‘s cross-\nexamination, there was compelling evidence that Meskan participated in the fight.\nMeskan‘s long-time friend, Weston, testified that Meskan was with him in the fight and\nprovided a detailed account of Meskan‘s involvement. Weston‘s testimony was\n\n\n                                               8\n\fcorroborated by a neighborhood resident who witnessed the fight and identified Meskan\nas one of the assailants. The witness testified he ―wasn‘t completely sure‖ about his line-\nup identification because ―it was dark,‖ but expressed no hesitation when identifying\nMeskan at trial as one of the men who was ―kicking and punching the Latin guy in the\nmiddle of the street.‖ Viewing the evidence as a whole, any prosecutorial misconduct\nduring cross-examination was harmless because it is not ―reasonably probable that a\nresult more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of\nthe error.‖ (People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836.)\n2. Evidence of defendant Meskan’s association with a racist group was properly admitted\nto prove hate crime allegations.\n       The prosecution alleged the assaults were hate crimes motivated by the Mexican\nvictims‘ race, ethnicity or national origin. The defense made an in limine motion to\nexclude evidence of Meskan‘s White supremacist gang affiliation as improper character\nevidence (Evid. Code, § 1101, subd. (a)) and unduly prejudicial (Evid. Code, § 352). The\nmotion was denied and that ruling is challenged on appeal.\n       In his opening statement to the jury, the prosecutor presaged evidence that Meskan\nis a skinhead who ―lives by the convict code‖ of racism. Police officers testified that\nMeskan identified himself as a skinhead when arrested in March 2009 and again in\nDecember 2010 when arrested for the present offense. Jail records were admitted\nshowing that Meskan said he was affiliated with the skinheads gang and was placed in\nadministrative segregation for being ―involved in gang recruitment by fear or force.‖\nWeston testified that Meskan and Allen expressed racist views consistent with the\n―racially charged environment‖ of prison and jail. 5 Weston nevertheless insisted that\nMeskan is not a skinhead and that the assaults were not racially motivated.\n\n\n\n5\n        Weston explained that, in prison, people of different races ―don‘t share food. If there was\n[a] bowl of food that person was to eat, and you were to eat after [him], [you] don‘t share open\nfood with people [of] other races. . . . [Y]ou don‘t share . . . bunks. You don‘t go in the same\ncells. You don‘t cell up with other races. . . . [S]mall amounts of business are allowed, you know,\nbut typically, especially in prison, in prison yards, you don‘t really comingle that much.‖\n\n\n                                                9\n\f       Evidence of Meskan‘s association with skinheads and racist views was properly\nadmitted to prove motive for the assaults and to substantiate the hate crime allegations.\nMeskan contends the evidence impugned his character and was more prejudicial than\nprobative because there is no ―direct link‖ between his behavior in prison and his\nbehavior when out of custody. He argues that a prisoner‘s ―behavior is dictated by a need\nto survive, to be safe, and to navigate the politics of the prison populations. That does not\nobtain when a person is free from custody.‖ However, evidence of affiliation with racist\ngroups and beliefs is highly relevant in a hate crime prosecution. The possible lack of\ncorrelation between a particular person‘s behavior when jailed or free may be argued to a\njury but does not render evidence of jail behavior inadmissible.\n       In any event, the disputed evidence did not prejudice Meskan. Meskan‘s concern\nthat the evidence ―evoke[d] a great emotional bias‖ that led to guilt by association is\nunfounded. The jury acquitted him of all hate crime charges. The evidence of his racist\nbeliefs and gang association did not have an inflammatory impact on the jury.\n3. The prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct during closing argument.\n       Meskan contends the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument\nby arguing facts not in evidence and by appealing to the passion and prejudice of the jury.\n       ―We review claims of prosecutorial misconduct pursuant to a settled standard.\n‗Under California law, a prosecutor commits reversible misconduct if he or she makes\nuse of ―deceptive or reprehensible methods‖ when attempting to persuade either the trial\ncourt or the jury, and it is reasonably probable that without such misconduct, an outcome\nmore favorable to the defendant would have resulted. [Citation.] Under the federal\nConstitution, conduct by a prosecutor that does not result in the denial of the defendant‘s\nspecific constitutional rights—such as a comment upon the defendant‘s invocation of the\nright to remain silent—but is otherwise worthy of condemnation, is not a constitutional\nviolation unless the challenged action ― ‗so infected the trial with unfairness as to make\nthe resulting conviction a denial of due process.‘ ‖ ‘ [Citations.] In addition, ‗ ―a\ndefendant may not complain on appeal of prosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely\nfashion—and on the same ground—the defendant made an assignment of misconduct and\n\n\n                                              10\n\frequested that the jury be admonished to disregard the impropriety. [Citation.]‖ ‘\n[Citation.] Objection may be excused if it would have been futile or an admonition would\nnot have cured the harm.‖ (People v. Dykes (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 760.)\n       a. Weston‘s plea bargain\n       Meskan claims the prosecutor argued facts not in evidence and ―misled the jury as\nto the terms of Mr. Weston‘s plea agreement and the reason he received the plea deal.‖\nWeston testified that he was promised credit for time served and probation in exchange\nfor pleading guilty, providing information on White supremacist groups and testifying at\ntrial. In cross-examining Weston, defense counsel suggested that Weston tailored his\ntestimony to obtain favorable treatment and implicated Meskan in the crimes because he\nwas angry with Meskan for having refused an earlier offer of three years in prison\ncontingent on all defendants pleading guilty.\n       The prosecutor responded by arguing that Weston cooperated with the prosecution\nbecause he felt that he, Meskan and Allen had ―gone too far‖ in beating the victims and\nshould have accepted responsibility by taking the joint plea bargain offered defendants,\nand ―because he showed some human decency on this night when no one else did.‖6\n\n6\n         The prosecutor said that, after punching and kicking the men, ―Anthony Weston thought,\nthis is too much. [¶] And you don‘t have to take his word for it. You can judge a man by his\nactions, because he just didn‘t think it. He acted on it. He looked there for a moment. He watched\nRobert [Allen] and Justin [Meskan] kicking these poor young Mayan cousins, and he decided it\nwas enough. He went back into the middle of the street, and he dragged the lifeless body of Alex\nout of the street, onto the sidewalk. . . . [¶] Officer Smith from the San Francisco Police\nDepartment . . . sees him pulling the victim out of the street. And that‘s why he got a deal,\nbecause he showed some human decency on this night when no one else did.‖ Defense counsel\nobjected that the statement was ―not supported by the record.‖ The objection was overruled.\n         The prosecutor continued his argument: ―Nobody else showed these poor victims any\ndecency. They fled. They fled . . . running from the police. Meskan first, Allen second.\n[¶] Weston stayed behind. The only reason he got detained on scene, the only reason he came\ninto our investigation so early, is because he had the human decency to stay behind, to drag\nAlex‘s body out of the street. [¶] So you can imagine that he would think that this isn‘t fair. I‘m\nwilling to do three years. I did the crime; I‘ll do the time. And the guys who ran away and,\nbecause they ran away, they didn‘t get stopped at the scene. They want to go to trial. They want\nto come and lie in court and say they weren‘t even there that night. And that made him mad, that\nthere was no loyalty, and there was no recognition for the fact that he was willing to say, no, on\nthis particular night. That‘s why he — that‘s why he got a deal.‖\n\n\n                                                11\n\f       Meskan says the prosecutor misled the jury in stating that Weston received a plea\ndeal ―because he showed some human decency‖ in carrying the victim from the street\nwhen, in fact, Weston received the deal for testifying against defendants. There is no\nreasonable likelihood the jury was misled. A copy of the plea bargain was admitted in\nevidence and its terms were explored at length during Weston‘s examination and cross-\nexamination. The jury knew Weston had to testify at defendants‘ trial to obtain the\nbenefits of the plea agreement. The jury was instructed to consider whether a witness‘s\ntestimony was influenced by bias or ―a personal interest in how the case is decided.‖\n(CALCRIM No. 226.) The jury was further advised that Weston was an accomplice to\nany assault and ―testimony of an accomplice that tends to incriminate the defendant\nshould be viewed with caution.‖ (CALCRIM No. 335.) In his closing argument, the\nprosecutor acknowledged that Weston‘s favorable sentence was conditioned upon his\ntestimony. The prosecutor‘s reference to Weston‘s ―human decency‖ as a motivating\nfactor for the plea offer was a minor point in a long explanation of why Weston was\noffered, and accepted, a plea bargain.\n       b. The convict code\n       The prosecutor argued: ―Anthony Weston told you that [Meskan and Allen]\nsubscribed to the convict code. They don‘t eat with Blacks. They don‘t share food. They\ndon‘t cross racial lines. And that‘s what drove them on this night. When they saw Weston\ntake a punch, they followed the convict code and jumped in a group beating.‖ An\nunspecified objection was made and discussed off the record. The statement was allowed\nto stand. Meskan claims the statement lacks factual support and constitutes prosecutorial\nmisconduct.\n       There was no misconduct. ―The prosecution is given wide latitude during closing\nargument to vigorously argue its case and to comment fairly on the evidence, including\nby drawing reasonable inferences from it.‖ (People v. Lee (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365445\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365445/people-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 647.)\nWeston testified that Meskan and Allen expressed racist views consistent with the\n―racially charged environment‖ of prison and jail where the races do not share food, bunk\ntogether or socialize. From this evidence, the prosecutor could fairly argue that racial\n\n\n                                             12\n\fself-segregation by inmates is a ―convict code‖ and that those adhering to it would be\nmotivated to join their friend in a cross-racial altercation.\n       c. San Francisco\n       Meskan contends the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passion and prejudice\nof the jury by invoking the community‘s racial tolerance in his closing remarks. The\nprosecutor argued, over objection, ―This isn‘t Alabama. This is San Francisco. You\nknow, I have a vision for San Francisco. . . . San Francisco is a town that welcomes our\nhard working immigrants. San Francisco is a town that can celebrate a Good Samaritan\nwho would jump to save a stranger. San Francisco is a city where somebody can be\nredeemed, Anthony Weston, when they drag a victim out of the street, and then confess\nto their crimes. Hate prejudice has no place in San Francisco. . . . I finish by asking you,\non behalf of Alex and Omar, on behalf of our town, on behalf of the City of San\nFrancisco, . . . I ask for justice for Alex and Omar.‖\n       A prosecutor may properly refer to ―the jury as the ‗conscience of the community‘\nor as representatives of the community.‖ (People v. Ledesma (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599941\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599941/people-v-ledesma/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741.)\nA prosecutor may not, however, ― ‗make arguments to the jury that give it the impression\nthat ―emotion may reign over reason,‖ and to present ―irrelevant information or\ninflammatory rhetoric that diverts the jury‘s attention from its proper role, or invites an\nirrational, purely subjective response.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Redd (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387024\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387024/people-v-redd/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742.)\nNor may a prosecutor ―suggest that jurors consider public opinion in deciding guilt.‖ or\n― ‗urge jurors to convict a criminal defendant in order to protect community values,\npreserve civil order, or deter future lawbreaking.‘ The evil lurking in such prosecutorial\nappeals is that the defendant will be convicted for reasons wholly irrelevant to his own\nguilt or innocence. Jurors may be persuaded by such appeals to believe that, by\nconvicting a defendant, they will assist in the solution of some pressing social\nproblem. . . . [¶] But a request that the jury ―condemn‖ an accused for engaging in illegal\nactivities is not constitutionally infirm, so long as it is not calculated to excite prejudice\nor passion.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 743, fn. 25.)\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f       The prosecutor‘s brief reference to his ―vision‖ of San Francisco as a place\nwithout race-based hatred was not likely to divert the jury from its duty to weigh the\nevidence rationally. The remark came at the end of a long, 37-page closing argument that\nthoroughly reviewed the evidence and applicable legal principles. Race hatred was an\nelement of the charged crimes and the subject of extensive trial testimony. An eyewitness\ntestified that the words he heard during the attack, like ―White power‖ and ―fucking\nspics,‖ is ―[j]ust stuff you don‘t hear in San Francisco.‖ When read in context, the\nprosecutor‘s argument was not a ― ‗deceptive or reprehensible method[]‘ ‖ used to\npersuade the jury to abandon reason for passion. (People v. Dykes, supra, 46 Cal.4th at\np. 760.) To whatever extent the prosecutor‘s closing remarks may have strayed outside\nthe proper scope of argument, there was no prejudice. As previously indicated, Meskan\nwas acquitted of all hate crime charges.\n4. Meskan’s failure to dispute imposition of a booking fee forfeits the claim on appeal.\n       The trial court imposed a $135 jail booking fee without an express finding of\nMeskan‘s financial ability to pay the fee. (Gov. Code, § 29550.2.) Meskan contends the\ncourt erred by imposing the fee without the proper findings and maintains there is no\nevidence to support his ability to pay or the actual administrative cost of booking. The\nAttorney General correctly asserts that Meskan forfeited his claims by failing to object in\nthe trial court to imposition of the fee. ―[A] defendant who does nothing to put at issue\nthe propriety of imposition of a booking fee forfeits the right to challenge the sufficiency\nof the evidence to support imposition of the booking fee on appeal.‖ (People v.\nMcCullough (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 598.) ― ‗[I]t is both unfair and inefficient to permit a\nclaim of error on appeal that, if timely brought to the attention of the trial court, could\nhave been easily corrected or avoided.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 593.)\nB. Robert Allen’s appeal\n1. The prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct in his opening statement.\n       Allen contends the prosecutor‘s opening statement was unsupported by the record\nand appealed to passion and prejudice. The prosecutor‘s statement does contain several\ninaccuracies and rhetorical flourishes but no use of ― ‗deceptive or reprehensible methods\n\n\n                                              14\n\fto persuade the jury‘ ‖ amounting to prejudicial misconduct. (People v. Williams (2013)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 671.)\n       a. The victim‘s work\n       During opening statement, the prosecutor said the evidence would show that Alex\nCauich ―works 100 hours a week, and he sends every penny he can back home.‖ Allen\ncomplains the statement was ―not born[e] out by the evidence he would present.‖ Alex\ntestified that he works ―about 50 hours a week‖ and was never asked if he sends money\nhome. There does not appear to be any deliberate effort to mislead the jury. The\nprosecutor may have overstated Alex‘s work hours because he thought Alex worked 50\nhours at each of two restaurant locations rather than 50 hours total.7 The prosecutor may\nnever have asked Alex if he sent money home because this line of questioning about\nAlex‘s life and work habits drew numerous relevancy objections. The prosecutor‘s\nassertion that Alex ―sends every penny he can back home‖ had some basis in the fact that\nAlex seemed to live below his means, in a residential hotel room with two other men. To\nthe extent the prosecutor‘s statement was an improper appeal for victim sympathy, as the\ndefense now asserts, it was a small impropriety without prejudicial impact.\n       b. The victim heard an ethnic epithet.\n       The prosecutor said Alex would testify that, while waiting for his cousin outside\nthe Nite Cap Bar, ―he hears somebody make an anti-Latino epithet towards him,\nsomething along the lines of, you fucking Latino. And then the next thing he knows, he‘s\npunched in the middle of the forehead.‖ This differed slightly from Alex‘s trial\ntestimony. Alex testified he was punched in the face and ―maybe‖ heard someone say\nsomething at the moment of impact but ―got punched so hard‖ that he does not\n―remember any exact words.‖ There is no indication that the prosecutor misstated the\n\n7\n         The prosecutor‘s direct examination of Alex suggests this possible misunderstanding:\n―Q. . . . [I]n a one-week period, how many hours a week do you work? . . . [¶] [A.] Well, I‘m just\nworking too much. I maybe work about 50 hours a week. [¶] [Q.] And do you have more than\none job? [¶] A. Yes. I‘m working with the same company. Two jobs, but with the same\ncompany. [¶] Q. Okay. Is the 50 hours a week at the one location, or is [it] at both locations?\n[¶] A. No. At both locations.‖\n\n\n                                               15\n\fexpected testimony. The prosecutor seems to have thought Alex would testify to hearing\nan ethnic epithet because the prosecutor pressed Alex on direct examination to recount\nwhat he heard. Alex testified with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter and may have\nhad difficulty recounting words spoken in English. The minor discrepancy between what\nthe prosecutor said Alex would testify, and what he did testify is immaterial. While Alex\ncould not recall what was said, other witnesses substantiated the prosecutor‘s\nrepresentation that ethnic epithets were spoken during the attack.\n       c. ―Wife-beater‖ undershirt\n       Allen contends the prosecutor wrongly appealed to the passion and prejudice of\nthe jury by saying Allen was arrested at the scene of the crime ―wearing a very distinctive\nwhite wife beater—you‘re going to hear that come up again and again, a distinctive white\nwife beater shirt.‖ This slang term for a tank top undershirt was used by two different\ntrial witnesses. An eyewitness to the street fight said one man ―was doing a majority of\nthe kicking‖ and described that man as ―wearing a white, like undershirt, like tank top. I\nthink they call them wife beaters.‖ Another eyewitness, when asked what the White men\nwere wearing, said ―[l]ike button up t-shirts, and a couple of them had a wife beater on.‖\nThe prosecutor did not commit misconduct by introducing the jury to a slang term\nemployed by witnesses in the case.\n       d. Skinhead groups\n       The prosecutor told the jury Weston would testify that he accepted a cooperation\nagreement with the prosecution because he owed no loyalty to Meskan and Allen after\nthey refused ―a fair deal‖ for a joint plea and ―[m]ore importantly, he‘s going to tell you\nabout the second reason that he took this deal. And the second reason is because he‘s\ntired of this lifestyle. He‘s tired of the drugs. He‘s tired of the violence. He‘s tired of the\nbad influences, the bad influences in his life. And he realized he needed to make a clean\nbreak. And his participation as a prosecution witness is much more than just coming to\ncourt and telling you these are the two guys who [did] it. [¶] It‘s much more than that. He\nhas turned his back on the entire lifestyle. He‘s going to tell you that he used to be a\nskinhead. And he‘s going to tell you that, as part of the deal, he‘s given the prosecution,\n\n\n                                               16\n\fhe‘s given law enforcement information. That‘s part of the deal. And you‘ll see a copy of\nthe deal that we reached with Mr. Weston. He‘s naming names. [¶] He‘s told us about the\nthree active skinhead groups operating here.. . . He‘s named 40 names of the active\nskinhead leadership here in this city. And he‘s told us what they‘re doing, what they‘re\ninvolved in. . . . I was going to tell you that the skinhead movement is growing here in\nSan Francisco because of realignment, because people who used to go to state prison are\nnow going to county jail. He‘s going to tell you that people are coming to San Francisco,\nbecause, in his words, if . . . you‘ve got a bag of speed in San Mateo County, you‘re\ngoing to state prison. If you got a bag of speed in San Francisco, you‘re going to be sent\nto a drug program.‖\n       Allen contends the prosecutor presented ―inflammatory rhetoric to the jury‖ that\n―hoards of drug-dealing skinheads were headed for San Francisco‖ without evidentiary\nsupport for the assertions. The references to a growing skinhead movement because of\nlenient drug crime sentencing was unsubstantiated and improper. Most of the\nprosecutor‘s address to the jury, however, was an accurate summarization of Weston‘s\ntestimony and relevant to the hate crime allegations. Weston said there are ―a lot of\ndifferent types of skinheads‖ and ―they consider themselves a movement, not a gang.‖ He\ntestified that he was affiliated with the skinheads for about four years but was no longer a\n―member‖ because he ―was tired of prison and crime and drugs‖ and did not ―want to be\ninvolved in this type of life style anymore.‖ Weston testified that he identified skinhead\ngroups as part of his plea agreement, consistent with the prosecutor‘s opening statement.\n       We reject Allen‘s contention that all ―evidence and argument about skinhead\ngangs . . . was not relevant‖ because there was no allegation that the crimes were\ncommitted to benefit a gang. While no gang enhancements were alleged, there were\nallegations that the assaults were hate crimes motivated by the victims‘ race, ethnicity or\nnational origin. Evidence of Weston‘s and Meskan‘s affiliation with a racist group like\nthe skinheads was highly relevant to the hate crime allegations. Allen argues that the\nprosecutor‘s discussion of skinhead groups wrongly insinuated that Allen was a gang\nmember. But the prosecutor did not mention Allen when summarizing Weston‘s former\n\n\n                                             17\n\fassociation with skinheads. Nothing in the prosecutor‘s summarization contradicted\nWeston‘s testimony that Allen expressed racist views but was not a member of the\nskinheads. Viewed as a whole, the prosecutor‘s statements about skinhead groups were\nproper. The unsubstantiated remark about the skinhead movement growing in San\nFrancisco because of realignment and lenient drug crime sentencing was a minor\nimpropriety without prejudicial impact. ―Although defendant singles out words and\nphrases, or at most a few sentences, to demonstrate misconduct, we must view the\nstatements in the context of the argument as a whole.‖ (People v. Dennis (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1111213\"><a href=\"/opinion/1111213/people-v-dennis/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522.)\n       e. Runic writings\n       Allen asserts the prosecutor falsely attributed runic writings to him. The\nprosecutor told the jury the police searched Allen‘s apartment and ―located paper work\nwithin Robert Allen‘s school paper work. And on this paper work, there‘s runic writings.\nYou‘re going to hear from witnesses that runic writings are used by White supremacists.\n[¶] It‘s claimed by White supremacists, who trace it back to the Nazis, who saw runic\nwriting as a descendent—as the origin of the Germanic language. And on this page that\nlists all the runic alphabet and all the English alphabet, so you can translate one to the\nother, you‘ll see words on this page. And one of the words, one of the phrases that you‘ll\nsee translated into runic, is White power, the very phrase that was yelled during this\nassault.‖\n       Trial testimony largely supports the prosecutor‘s statements. Sergeant Schwarz-\nChoy testified she found a piece of paper with runic writing among loose papers in a box\nlocated in a closet in Allen‘s apartment. The closet contained other papers, including\nhandwritten homework bearing Allen‘s name. The runic writing was therefore found in a\ncloset shared with Allen‘s school paperwork rather than, as the prosecutor said, ―within\nRobert Allen‘s school paper work.‖ The difference is minor and inconsequential. The\nprosecutor‘s assertion that ―runic writings are used by White supremacists‖ is fully\nsupported by the record. Weston testified that skinheads use runic writing as a secret\n\n\n\n                                              18\n\flanguage and the runic writing located in Allen‘s apartment contained the phrase ―White\npower.‖\n       f. Kicks to the victims‘ heads\n       Allen argues the evidence does not support the prosecutor‘s statement that he and\nMeskan ―brutally kicked [the victims] in the head while they‘re down on the ground.‖\nThe statement is well supported by the evidence. Weston testified that Allen and Meskan\nkicked Alex and that a resident saw Alex on the ground surrounded by men who\n―repeatedly kicked [him] in the face.‖ Omar testified that three men threw him to the\nground and punched and kicked him in the head and back. The opening statement\nmatched the evidence presented.\n2. The prosecutor did not commit prejudicial misconduct in his closing statement.\n       a. Interactions with Mott\n       A witness who lives near the Nite Cap Bar testified that he saw a group of people\nthat looked like skinheads talking to a bar regular named ―Mott‖ just before the assault.\nThe resident described Mott as ―the neighborhood skinhead‖ and said he and Weston\n―had similar tattoos‖ and were talking together. In closing argument, the prosecutor\nargued the assaults were hate crimes and interpreted the interaction between Weston‘s\ngroup and Mott as ―checking . . . in with [Mott] to get the play call.‖ The prosecutor\nargued: ―These two Mexicans wandered into the wrong bar. [Mott] . . . the resident\nskinhead made a call. And these guys were the enforcers.‖\n       Allen argues the prosecutor ―urged the jury to draw the unreasonable inference\nthat Mott had passed orders‖ to defendants ―to go beat up Mexicans‖ when there was no\nevidence that Mott was directing defendants‘ actions. There was no misconduct.\n―Prosecutors have wide latitude to discuss and draw inferences from the evidence at trial.\n[Citation.] Whether the inferences the prosecutor draws are reasonable is for the jury to\ndecide.‖ (People v. Dennis, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 522.) The jury here appears to have\nfound the inference unreasonable. The jury acquitted defendants of hate crime charges\nand thus, even if the remarks were improper, they were not prejudicial.\n\n\n\n                                            19\n\f       b. Allen as a ―skinhead wannabe‖\n       Allen says he was wrongly referred to as a ―skinhead wannabe‖ during closing\nargument when ―there was no evidence that Allen has aspirations to become either a\nskinhead or Nazi.‖ In referring to Allen, the prosecutor said: ―[W]e‘ve put in no evidence\nthat he‘s a skinhead. That‘s not what we‘re alleging here. But what we‘re saying is, he\nlikes hanging out with them, right? He hangs out with folks like Richard Trietsch, who\nhas a swastika tattooed on his leg. He lived with Richard Trietsch in Daly City and\ninvited Richard Trietsch into his home in San Francisco. [¶] Inspector Choy told you that,\nas soon as she walks into Allen‘s apartment at 850 Geary, the first thing that you see in\nthe common area of the hallway is a photograph of Richard Trietsch saluting before a\nNazi flag.‖ The prosecutor recalled Weston‘s testimony that Allen held racist views and\nthen proceeded to describe the assault: ―[T]here were a lot of actions which show that this\nwas a hate assault. Allen was the loudest one. He‘s the wannabe. That‘s what I keep\nreferring to him as. He wants to prove himself to the skinheads, to the Nazis.‖\n       The prosecutor‘s argument was a fair comment upon the evidence and the\ninferences to be drawn from it. There was no testimony that Allen wanted to prove\nhimself to the skinheads, as Allen notes on appeal, but the prosecutor was free to argue\nthat the evidence of Allen‘s racist views, close association with White supremacists and\nprominent display of Nazi décor in his apartment supported the inference that Allen was a\nskinhead ―wannabe.‖\n       c. Comments about defense counsel.\n       Allen claims the prosecutor twice used his closing argument to disparage defense\ncounsel. ―Personal attacks on opposing counsel are improper and irrelevant to the issues.‖\n(People v. Sandoval (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1236383\"><a href=\"/opinion/1236383/people-v-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184.) Here, the prosecutor‘s remark that\ndefense counsel ―echoed‖ defendants‘ view that the victims ―didn‘t belong‖ was\nimproper, but any harm was obviated by the court‘s swift action in striking the statement.\n       The other disputed remark concerns the prosecutor‘s rebuttal to defense counsel‘s\naccusation that the prosecution engaged in an ―egregious . . . manipulation of evidence‖\nin presenting to the jury a photograph of a Hitler screensaver on one of the computers\n\n\n                                            20\n\fseized from Allen‘s apartment rather than the computer itself. The defense claimed the\ncomputer with the Hitler screensaver belonged to someone else and the second computer\nbelonged to Allen. To prove its point, the defense brought the second computer to court,\nturned it on, and showed that the screensaver was a photograph of Allen. Defense counsel\nargued that the prosecutor could have done the same but did not because it would\ncontradict his theory of the case. Defense counsel called upon the jury to defend the\nconstitution and ―stand between an overzealous government and the people who live\nhere.‖\n         In rebuttal, the prosecutor said defense counsel ―waived the American flag and\ntalked to you about how important . . . our constitutional rights are. And then they want to\ncome back and say, well, why didn‘t we turn on the computer? The inspector told you the\nreason. She told you that we‘re not allowed to do that. It requires a search warrant.‖ The\nprosecutor said the defense should not ―blame us for not turning on the computer here in\nthe courtroom, when we would violate constitutional rights. We are not allowed to do\nthat.‖\n         Allen argues that the prosecutor wrongly ―berated‖ defense counsel for ―waiv[ing]\nthe American flag.‖ The prosecutor‘s argument was not a personal attack upon defense\ncounsel but a fair response to issues raised by the defense. Allen asserts that the\nprosecutor‘s response, even if not a personal attack, was misconduct because the response\nwas legally incorrect in asserting that the prosecutor could not turn on the computer\nwithout obtaining a search warrant. The point is immaterial because the jury was not\nlikely to be misled by the attorneys‘ pointed exchange over the handling of computer\nevidence. The computer was turned on and the jury could draw its own conclusion about\nownership.\n3. Evidence of Allen’s skinhead associations and Nazi paraphernalia seized from his\napartment was properly admitted to prove hate crime allegations.\n         Allen claims the computer with a Hitler screensaver and a paper and hammer with\nrunic writing seized from his apartment were wrongly admitted to prove his character. He\nfurther claims that evidence of the racist views of Weston, Meskan and Trietsch ―was\n\n\n                                             21\n\firrelevant and highly prejudicial.‖ The evidence was properly admitted. As explained in\nconnection with Meskan‘s appeal, evidence of Allen‘s association with skinheads and\nracist views was properly admitted to prove motive for the assaults and to substantiate the\nhate crime allegations.\n4. The court properly admitted limited evidence regarding gangs.\n       The court admitted evidence that Meskan identified himself to jailers as a skinhead\nwhen arrested in March 2009 and again in December 2010 when arrested for the present\noffense. Allen argues that ―evidence of gangs is highly prejudicial‖ and negatively\nimpacted his case despite the prosecutor‘s clear acknowledgment in closing argument\nthat there is ―no evidence that [Allen is] a skinhead.‖ The limited evidence was properly\nadmitted and not prejudicial. The jury was not misled to think Allen was a gang member\nor disposed to White supremacist gang violence. The jury acquitted defendants of all hate\ncrime allegations.\n5. Allen’s battery conviction does not violate the double jeopardy clause.\n       As noted above, Allen was convicted of two counts relating to Alex: (1) assault by\nmeans of force likely to cause great bodily injury (§ 245, subd. (a)(1)) with personal\ninfliction of great bodily injury (§ 12022.7, subd. (a)) and (2) battery with personal\ninfliction of serious bodily injury (§ 243, subd. (d)). Execution of sentence on the battery\ncount was stayed because the assault and battery arose from the same course of conduct.\n(§ 654.)\n       Allen contends that staying punishment on the battery conviction is insufficient\nand that the conviction must be vacated because it violates the double jeopardy clause.\nHe mistakes the scope of the clause. The double jeopardy clause provides that no ―person\n[shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.‖ (U.S.\nConst., 5th Amend.) ―The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple\ncriminal punishments for the same offense, [citations], and then only when such occurs in\nsuccessive proceedings.‖ (Hudson v. United States (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118155\"><a href=\"/opinion/118155/hudson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 99, italics\naltered.) In a single trial, the double jeopardy clause does no ―more than prevent the\nsentencing court from prescribing greater punishment than the Legislature intended.‖\n\n\n                                             22\n\f(Missouri v. Hunter (1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110824\"><a href=\"/opinion/110824/missouri-v-hunter/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366.) ―Federal law, like California statutory\nlaw, clearly recognizes that cumulative punishment may be imposed under two statutes,\neven where they proscribe the same conduct, if the legislature has specifically authorized\ncumulative punishment.‖ (People v. Sloan (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631022\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631022/people-v-sloan/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121.)\n       The California Legislature has specifically authorized multiple conviction.\n(§ 954.) However, ― ‗[a] judicially created exception to the general rule permitting\nmultiple conviction ―prohibits multiple convictions based on necessarily included\noffenses.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 116.) ― ‗[O]nly a statutorily lesser\nincluded offense is subject to the bar against multiple convictions in the same\nproceeding.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 118, italics added.) Allen‘s conviction for battery with personal\ninfliction of serious bodily injury is not a statutorily lesser included offense to assault by\nmeans of force likely to cause great bodily injury. It is only the assault‘s enhancement for\nactual infliction of great bodily injury (deemed equivalent to serious bodily injury)8 that\nbrings the elements of the two offenses into alignment. But enhancements may not be\nconsidered when determining if one offense is a necessarily included offense of another\noffense. (Id. at p. 114.) ―In deciding whether multiple conviction is proper, a court should\nconsider only the statutory elements‖ of the substantive offenses. (Id. at p. 118.)\n       While multiple conviction for the same course of conduct is generally permitted,\nmultiple punishment generally is not. (People v. Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 116.)\nSection 654, subdivision (a) provides: ―An act or omission that is punishable in different\nways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides\nfor the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be\npunished under more than one provision.‖ Where, as here, a defendant is convicted of\ntwo offenses arising from the same course of conduct, the court stays execution of\nsentence on the offense with the shorter term of imprisonment. (People v. Sloan, supra, at\np. 116.) The court properly applied these principles here.\n\n\n8\n       ― ‗ ―[S]erious bodily‖ injury is the essential equivalent of ―great bodily injury‖ ‘ ‖ for\nmost purposes. (People v. Sloan, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 117.)\n\n\n                                                 23\n\f                                   DISPOSITION\n     The judgments are affirmed.\n\n\n\n                                            _________________________\n                                            Pollak, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n_________________________\nMcGuiness, P.
