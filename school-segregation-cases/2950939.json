NEWSOM JONES A/K/A\n        BERTHA MAE NEWSOM JONES, DECEASED\n\n\n                On appeal from the County Court\n                  of Jefferson County, Texas.\n\n\n                     NUMBER 13-11-00692-CV\n\n                      IN RE LINDA D. BURKE\n\n\n                On Petition for Writ of Prohibition.\n\n\n                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\nBefore Chief Justice Valdez and Justices Garza and Benavides\n           Memorandum Opinion by Justice Garza\n This appeal and parallel petition for writ of prohibition arise from a probate\n\fproceeding. In the appeal,1 appellant/relator Linda D. Burke contends that the probate\n\ncourt (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) erred by denying her motion for\n\ndirected verdict on an application to remove Burke as independent administrator of the\n\nestate. In the original proceeding,2 Burke seeks an order prohibiting the probate court\n\nfrom appointing a successor administrator in the case.                        We will affirm the probate\n\ncourt’s judgment and deny the petition for writ of prohibition.\n\n                                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2006, Burke filed an application to probate the will of her deceased mother,\n\nBertha M. Newsom Jones a/k/a Bertha Mae Newsom Jones (“Bertha”). Bertha’s will\n\nnamed Burke and her other children, appellees/real parties in interest Michael Van\n\nCleve Jones (“Michael”) and William F. Jones (“Billy”), as executors of her estate,3 and it\n\nleft all of her property to the three children. The will was probated and, with Michael’s\n\nand Billy’s consent, letters testamentary were granted to Burke as independent executor\n\nof the estate. See TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 145(a) (West Supp. 2011). An inventory,\n\nappraisal, and list of claims were submitted and approved by the probate court.\n\n       Subsequently, believing that Burke was guilty of gross misconduct or gross\n\nmismanagement of the estate, Michael and Billy filed an application to remove Burke as\n\nindependent administrator.              See id. § 149C (West Supp. 2011).                The application\n       1\n           Appellate cause number 13-11-00664-CV.\n       2\n           Appellate cause number 13-11-00692-CV.\n       3\n           In particular, Bertha’s will stated in relevant part as follows:\n\n       I am asking that Linda D. Burke named here with [sic] shall act as Executrix of this Will\n       and of my estate, and be assisted by Billy F. Jones II, Michael V.C. Jones. The three to\n       work together all the way. If for any reason at all one of the above named persons is\n       unable to fulfill his or her obligations pretaining [sic] to the estate of their mother Bertha\n       Newson-Jones [sic], Full power is granted to the remaining named persons, and that [sic]\n       this document will still be legal and binding in every respect.\n\n\n                                                         2\n\fspecifically contended that Burke withdrew $111,376 from a Wells Fargo bank account\n\nthat had been funded with proceeds obtained from payable-on-death (“P.O.D.”)\n\naccounts established by Bertha for her children’s benefit.                   The application also\n\ncontended that Burke: (1) “misapplied funds” belonging to the estate; (2) “spent\n\nunnecessary funds” on maintaining certain real property belonging to the estate; (3) “is[\n\n]making no productive effort” to sell that real property; and (4) advised Michael and Billy\n\nthrough her attorney that “she was no longer going to pay current debts of the Estate\n\nand the debts could be paid by [Michael and Billy].” Burke filed an answer denying the\n\nallegations, and she then filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which the probate court denied.\n\n       A hearing was held on Michael and Billy’s application on August 31, 2011. Burke\n\nwas the only witness to testify. At the close of the hearing, Burke’s counsel orally\n\nmoved for a directed verdict; the probate court denied the motion. On September 6,\n\n2011, the probate court rendered an order granting Michael and Billy’s application and\n\nremoving Burke as independent administrator. This appeal followed.4\n\n       After the notice of appeal was filed, the probate court filed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. The findings of fact were as follows:\n\n       1.    That [Burke] failed to segregate estate and non-estate assets in her\n             administrations of the estate;\n\n       2.    That Burke has made gross errors in accounting for estate assets\n             and disbursements;\n\n       3.    That Burke has anticipatorily repudiated her fiduciary responsibilities\n             as Independent Administrator by refusing to pay ad valorem taxes\n             due on estate property;\n\n       4.    That Burke expended significant estate funds without doing a\n             cost/benefit analysis of the financial effects such expenditures would\n\n       4\n          This appeal was transferred from the Ninth Court of Appeals pursuant to a docket equalization\norder issued by the Texas Supreme Court. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 73.001 (West 2005).\n\n                                                  3\n\f               have on the estate;\n\n       5.      That Burke expended estate funds on personal expenses which\n               included meals;\n\n       6.      That Burke engaged in self-dealing by claiming payments from estate\n               funds for work allegedly done by her husband;\n\n       7.      That Burke displayed a gross lack of attention to accounting for and\n               documenting expenses and disbursements of estate funds;\n\n       8.      That Burke expended estate funds for non-perishable items such as\n               tools without accounting for such purchases as estate assets after\n               the date of purchase;\n\n       9.      That Burke admitted to no understanding of            her fiduciary\n               responsibilities to the estate[;]\n\n       10. That Burke’s actions showed an intent to manage the interests of the\n           estate for her own benefit rather than all beneficiaries;\n\n       11. That Burke grossly mismanaged the estate in her attempted handling\n           of the sale of the decedent’s homestead[.]\n\nThe conclusions of law included the following: “Sufficient grounds appear to support the\n\nbelief that Burke has misapplied and/or is about to misapply property committed to her\n\ncare” and “Burke is guilty of gross mismanagement of the estate in the performance of\n\nher duties.”\n\n                                       II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       By her first issue on appeal, Burke argues that the probate court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction to render the challenged order because there were “no justiciable\n\nissues” properly before the court. Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a\n\nquestion of law that we review de novo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133\n\n\n\n\n                                             4\n\fS.W.3d 217, 226 (Tex. 2004); Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74\n\nS.W.3d 849, 855 (Tex. 2002).\n\n          Burke’s argument is based on the fact—undisputed by Michael and Billy—that\n\nthe Wells Fargo bank account was originally funded by proceeds from P.O.D. accounts,\n\nand she notes that P.O.D. accounts do not become part of a decedent’s estate but\n\nrather pass outside of probate. See TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 439A(b)(2) (West Supp.\n\n2011) (promulgating a form to be used by financial institutions in establishing P.O.D.\n\naccounts which states: “The party to the account owns the account. On the death of\n\nthe party, ownership of the account passes to the P.O.D. beneficiaries of the account.\n\nThe account is not a part of the party’s estate”); see also Punts v. Wilson, 137 S.W.3d\n\n889, 892 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2004, no pet.). Burke argues that, because the funds\n\nin the Wells Fargo account were derived solely from Bertha’s P.O.D. accounts, “the trial\n\ncourt did not have any subject-matter jurisdiction over said proceeds and could not\n\nadjudicate any controversy concerning them.”\n\n          In support of her argument, Burke points to probate code section 145(h), which\n\nstates:\n\n          When an independent administration has been created, and the order\n          appointing an independent executor has been entered by the county court,\n          and the inventory, appraisement, and list aforesaid has been filed by the\n          executor and approved by the county court or an affidavit in lieu of the\n          inventory, appraisement, and list of claims has been filed by the executor,\n          as long as the estate is represented by an independent executor, further\n          action of any nature shall not be had in the county court except where this\n          Code specifically and explicitly provides for some action in the county\n          court.\n\nId. § 145(h). However, this statute does not categorically forbid the probate court from\n\nconducting further proceedings after an inventory, appraisal, and list of claims has been\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ffiled; instead, it permits such further proceedings when “specifically and explicitly” called\n\nfor elsewhere in the probate code. And, section 149C of the probate code specifically\n\nand explicitly provides as follows:\n\n        The county court, as that term is defined by Section 3 of this code,[5] on its\n        own motion or on motion of any interested person, after the independent\n        executor has been cited by personal service to answer at a time and place\n        fixed in the notice, may remove an independent executor when:\n\n                ...\n\n        (2)     sufficient grounds appear to support belief that the independent\n                executor has misapplied or embezzled, or that the independent\n                executor is about to misapply or embezzle, all or any part of the\n                property committed to the independent executor’s care;\n\n                . . . [or]\n\n        (5)     the independent executor is proved to have been guilty of gross\n                misconduct or gross mismanagement in the performance of the\n                independent executor’s duties . . . .\n\nId. § 149C(a), (a)(2), (a)(5).          Burke does not dispute that Michael and Billy are\n\n“interested person[s]” or that she was properly served with citation.                         The statute\n\ntherefore clearly authorizes the probate court to exercise jurisdiction over an application,\n\nsuch as that filed by Michael and Billy, alleging that an independent administrator of an\n\nestate misapplied estate funds or exhibited gross misconduct or gross mismanagement\n\nin her duties.6\n\n\n        5\n           “‘County Court’ and ‘Probate Court’ are synonymous terms and denote county courts in the\nexercise of their probate jurisdiction, courts created by statute and authorized to exercise original probate\njurisdiction, and district courts exercising probate jurisdiction in contested matters.” TEX. PROB. CODE\nANN. § 3(e) (West Supp. 2011).\n        6\n           Burke also contends that subject matter jurisdiction did not lie because Michael and Billy’s\napplication failed to “specifically allege facts as to how [Burke] has been guilty of gross misconduct and/or\ngross mismanagement and must specifically allege facts as to how [Burke] misapplied or embezzled\nestate funds.” This is a misstatement of the law. A plaintiff should plead facts supporting jurisdiction but\nspecific allegations about subject matter jurisdiction are not required. Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Beckner,\n74 S.W.3d 98, 103–04, 104 n.10 (Tex. App.—Waco 2002, no pet.) (citing Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air\n\n                                                     6\n\f        We overrule Burke’s first issue.\n\nB.      Motion for Directed Verdict\n\n        By her second issue, Burke contends that the probate court erred by denying her\n\noral motion for directed verdict.           A directed verdict is proper when a defect in the\n\nopponent's pleadings makes them insufficient to support a judgment, the evidence\n\nconclusively proves a fact that establishes a party’s right to judgment as a matter of law,\n\nor the evidence offered on a cause of action is insufficient to raise an issue of fact.\n\nKoepke v. Martinez, 84 S.W.3d 393, 395 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2002, pet. denied).\n\nEvidence is legally insufficient to raise an issue of fact when: (1) there is a complete\n\nabsence of evidence of the fact; (2) the court is barred by rules of law or evidence from\n\ngiving weight to the only evidence offered to prove the fact; (3) the evidence offered to\n\nprove the fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) the evidence conclusively\n\nestablishes the opposite of the fact. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822–23\n\n(Tex. 2005). We review all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-\n\nmovant, credit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregard contrary\n\nevidence if reasonable jurors could. Id. at 827.\n\n        Burke’s motion contended that Michael and Billy failed to establish any of the\n\nelements listed in Texas Probate Code section 149C, subsections (a)(2) or (a)(5). See\n\nTEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 149C(a)(2), (a)(5).                  As noted, those subsections permit a\n\nprobate court to remove an independent administrator of an estate when “sufficient\n\n\nControl Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex. 1993); TEX. R. CIV. P. 47, 78–82). In any event, if Burke believed\nthe allegations contained in the application to remove her as executor were insufficiently specific to\nestablish subject matter jurisdiction, it was incumbent upon her to file a special exception to that pleading.\nSee id. at 104 (“If the pleadings do not affirmatively establish subject matter jurisdiction, the proper\nprocedure for objecting is to file a special exception to require an amended pleading.”) (citing Peek v.\nEquip. Serv. Co., 779 S.W.2d 802, 805 (Tex. 1989); Godley Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Woods, 21 S.W.3d 656,\n661 (Tex. App.—Waco 2000, pet denied); TEX. R. CIV. P. 63, 90, 91). She did not do so.\n\n                                                      7\n\fgrounds appear to support belief that the independent executor has misapplied or\n\nembezzled, or that the independent executor is about to misapply or embezzle, all or\n\nany part of the property committed to the independent executor’s care” or when “the\n\nindependent executor is proved to have been guilty of gross misconduct or gross\n\nmismanagement in the performance of the independent executor’s duties . . . .” Id. §\n\n149C(a)(2), (a)(5).        In Kappus v. Kappus, the Texas Supreme Court noted that\n\nsubsection 149C(a)(2) “associates misapplication with embezzlement,” and therefore,\n\n“we give these terms a related meaning and interpret them to authorize removal if the\n\ntrial court believes the executor was engaged in subterfuge or wrongful misuse.” 284\n\nS.W.3d 831, 835–36 (Tex. 2009).                The Kappus Court also noted that, in drafting\n\nsubsection 149C(a)(5), the Legislature did not use “misconduct or mismanagement” but\n\nrather “gross misconduct or gross mismanagement.”                      Id. at 836.     The use of the\n\nadjective “gross,” which means “glaringly obvious” or “flagrant,” indicates that\n\n“something beyond ordinary misconduct and ordinary mismanagement is required to\n\nremove an independent executor.” Id.7\n\n        Burke testified that she, Michael and Billy each obtained approximately $34,000\n\nfrom the P.O.D. accounts upon Bertha’s death. The three then voluntarily contributed\n\n\n        7\n           Prior to Kappus, courts generally held that “gross misconduct” and “gross mismanagement”\nincluded (1) any willful omission to perform a legal duty, (2) any intentional commission of a wrongful act,\nor (3) any breach of a fiduciary duty that resulted in actual harm to a beneficiary’s interests. See, e.g.,\nEstate of Casida, 13 S.W.3d 519, 524 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2000, no pet.). This standard is more strict\nthan the one stated in Kappus in that it allows removal of an executor upon a finding of “any” willful or\nintentional malfeasance; Kappus, on the other hand, appears to require that such malfeasance also be\n“glaringly obvious” or “flagrant.” See Kappus v. Kappus, 284 S.W.3d 831, 836 (Tex. 2009). The Kappus\ndecision controls. See City of Mission v. Cantu, 89 S.W.3d 795, 809 n.21 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n2002, no pet.) (“As an intermediate appellate court, we are bound to follow the expression of the law as\nstated by the Texas Supreme Court . . . .”).\n\n         We note that neither party, in their appellate briefs, saw fit to cite Kappus, the pre-Kappus case\nlaw, or any other law construing the applicable statute.\n\n\n                                                     8\n\fthose funds—totaling $102,000—for estate expenses because the estate did not\n\noriginally have enough cash on hand. Burke testified that she also received $31,000\n\nfrom a separate P.O.D. account. Burke testified that she opened a new bank account in\n\nthe name of the estate with all of these funds. At some point, Burke withdrew the\n\nremaining balance in the estate expense account, totaling about $75,000, and she\n\nopened a new account with those funds at Wells Fargo. With respect to the Wells\n\nFargo account, Burke was the owner and Michael, Billy, and Burke’s husband were\n\nnamed as beneficiaries.\n\n        Burke further testified that, with the assistance of an attorney, she compiled a\n\nreport of estate income and expenses covering the period from March 23, 2006 to\n\nDecember 31, 2007.8 The report, the accuracy of which was sworn to by Burke, was\n\nfiled with the probate court on March 27, 2008 and was admitted as evidence at the\n\nAugust 31, 2011 hearing. The document reflected that, during the accounting period,\n\nthe estate paid out claims in the total amount of $68,147.08 and received income in the\n\ntotal amount of $55,411.71.            The estate expenses included, among other things, a\n\n$1,134.14 payment to Burke for travel expenses, and a $4,443.43 payment to Burke for\n\n“[l]odging & [f]ood expenses.”9            The estate receipts included, among other things,\n\n$10,000 from a retirement fund of which all three parties were beneficiaries. 10 The\n\nannual account did not reflect the $133,000 that Burke testified was voluntarily\n\ncontributed by herself and her brothers for estate expenses.                           The document\n\n        8\n          Burke acknowledged that, as an independent administrator, she was not actually required to file\nan annual accounting report with the court. See TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 399 (West Supp. 2011)\n(requiring dependent administrators to file annual accounting reports).\n        9\n        The estate also made cash disbursements of $35,043.27, all of which was attributable to the\nupkeep and improvement of the estate’s real property.\n        10\n             Burke conceded that the proceeds from the retirement fund were not estate assets.\n\n                                                     9\n\faffirmatively stated that “[n]o property has come into the possession of the Independent\n\nExecutrix during this accounting period that has not been previously listed or inventoried\n\nas property of the estate.” Burke agreed with Michael and Billy’s counsel’s statement\n\nthat “even though this annual account says there was $55,000 that came into [t]he\n\nEstate, really there was $155,000 [sic] because of the $100,000 [sic] that the three of\n\nyou contributed[.]” The annual account stated that the estate had only $368.06 on hand\n\nat the end of the accounting period.\n\n      Also introduced into evidence was a document listing all of the administration\n\nexpenses made out-of-pocket by Burke which were not included on the annual account.\n\nThese expenses, incurred from January 21, 2006 to September 29, 2010, total\n\n$97,311.19.   Burke testified that she is asking to be reimbursed for all of these\n\nexpenses, “over and above what was already paid out of [t]he Estate.” Counsel pointed\n\nout that all but $12,578.47 of those expenses were incurred in 2006 and 2007 and that\n\nthe annual account submitted by Burke appears to state that she had already been\n\nreimbursed for those amounts.\n\n      With respect to the sale of the estate’s real property, Burke testified that she had\n\nentered into a contract with a buyer to sell the property, but the buyer reneged on the\n\ninitial agreement and instead demanded that Burke install new central air conditioning in\n\nthe house.    Burke testified that she refused to do so because the existing air\n\nconditioning unit had passed inspection. With respect to property taxes, the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n      Q. [Michael and Billy’s counsel]   Have the taxes been paid or is there a\n                                         plan to pay the taxes on the property for\n                                         2010?\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\f      A. [Burke]                        No. Taxes have not been paid.\n\n      Q.                                Did you instruct your lawyer to instruct\n                                        us that you weren’t going to be\n                                        responsible for paying the taxes and\n                                        that we should be responsible for it or\n                                        my clients?\n\n      A.                                I asked my attorney to write a letter and\n                                        ask my brother, Michael, since he was\n                                        working if he could pay the taxes since I\n                                        had paid the taxes for the last several\n                                        years. I had taken responsibility for\n                                        paying taxes on the house. I have taken\n                                        responsibility to pay the lawn care. I\n                                        paid the house insurance, all that has\n                                        come out of my pocket and I asked if he\n                                        could do it since the house is partially\n                                        his as well.\n\n      Q.                                All right.\n\n      A.                                I knew my brother, Billy, couldn’t do it,\n                                        but I figured Michael could do it. I have\n                                        been doing it the last four years.\n\n      Q.                                But you understand as the executor it is\n                                        your job to take those certain actions\n                                        and do those things, correct?\n\n      A.                                I just asked if he could do it.\n\n      Q.                                Okay.\n\n      A.                                I did not understand it was my\n                                        responsibility as executor to pay taxes\n                                        on a house that belonged to the three of\n                                        us. No, I didn’t understand that.\n\n      After both parties rested, the probate court asked Burke about several items on\n\nthe list of administration expenses that she asked to be reimbursed for. The court noted\n\nthat “[t]here were numerous charges in 2006 and 2007 to M & D Supply and Harbor\n\nFreight, charges were for purchases of tools.” Burke explained that these purchases\n\n                                          11\n\fwere for “painting, it could have been hammers, wrenches, plumbing tools, whatever we\n\nneeded to make repairs in the house.”\n\n       Based upon the foregoing evidence, the probate court could have reasonably\n\ndetermined that Burke committed gross misconduct or gross mismanagement of the\n\nestate in her role as independent administrator, see TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. §\n\n149C(a)(5), and that such misconduct or mismanagement was “glaringly obvious” or\n\n“flagrant.” See Kappus, 284 S.W.3d at 836. In particular, the evidence supports the\n\nprobate court’s findings of fact that Burke: (1) “failed to segregate estate and non-\n\nestate assets” in her administration of the estate; (2) “anticipatorily repudiated her\n\nfiduciary responsibilities as Independent Administrator by refusing to pay ad valorem\n\ntaxes due on estate property”; (3) “expended estate funds on personal expenses”\n\nincluding meals; (4) ”displayed a gross lack of attention to accounting for and\n\ndocumenting expenses and disbursements of estate funds”; and (5) “expended estate\n\nfunds for non-perishable items such as tools without accounting for such purchases as\n\nestate assets after the date of purchase.”11\n\n       The probate court did not err in denying Burke’s motion for directed verdict. Her\n\nsecond issue is overruled.\n\nC.     Petition for Writ of Prohibition\n\n       In her petition for writ of prohibition, Burke requests that we command the\n\npresiding judge of the probate court “not to hear [Michael and Billy’s application to\n\nappoint a dependent administrator], which is scheduled for hearing on November 2,\n\n\n       11\n           In light of our conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to support the probate court’s\njudgment under probate code section 149C(a)(5), regarding gross misconduct or gross mismanagement,\nwe need not address whether the court’s judgment was also proper under section 149C(a)(2), regarding\nmisapplication or embezzlement of estate assets. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n                                                 12\n\f2011, until [Burke] has exhausted all of her appellate remedies allowed by law.” She\n\nargues that the probate court lost its plenary power to appoint a successor administrator\n\nat the time she filed her appeal. Burke also filed a motion for emergency stay of all\n\nprobate court proceedings, which we granted on November 1, 2011. Michael and Billy\n\nfiled a motion to reconsider the stay, noting that Burke “has entered into a contract to\n\nsell the [estate’s] real property and is representing that she is still the Independent\n\nExecutor of the Estate.” We granted the motion to reconsider in part and rendered an\n\norder on December 13, 2011 staying “all underlying proceedings, including any and all\n\nactions purportedly taken on behalf of the estate or by a personal representative of the\n\nestate” until further order of this Court.\n\n       Given our ruling on Burke’s two appellate issues, the issues raised in the petition\n\nfor writ of prohibition are now moot. We therefore deny the petition and lift the stay.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the probate court. Further, Burke’s petition for writ of\n\nprohibition is denied, and any and all stays previously imposed by this Court on probate\n\ncourt proceedings or actions by purported administrators of the estate are hereby lifted\n\nin their entirety.\n\n\n\n                                                  ________________________\n                                                  DORI CONTRERAS GARZA\n                                                  Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n27th day of August, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f",

In the appeal,1 appellant/relator Linda D. Burke contends that the probate\n\ncourt (1) lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and (2) erred by denying her motion for\n\ndirected verdict on an application to remove Burke as independent administrator of the\n\nestate. In the original proceeding,2 Burke seeks an order prohibiting the probate court\n\nfrom appointing a successor administrator in the case.                        We will affirm the probate\n\ncourt’s judgment and deny the petition for writ of prohibition.\n\n                                                I. BACKGROUND\n\n       In 2006, Burke filed an application to probate the will of her deceased mother,\n\nBertha M. Newsom Jones a/k/a Bertha Mae Newsom Jones (“Bertha”). Bertha’s will\n\nnamed Burke and her other children, appellees/real parties in interest Michael Van\n\nCleve Jones (“Michael”) and William F. Jones (“Billy”), as executors of her estate,3 and it\n\nleft all of her property to the three children. The will was probated and, with Michael’s\n\nand Billy’s consent, letters testamentary were granted to Burke as independent executor\n\nof the estate. See TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 145(a) (West Supp. 2011). An inventory,\n\nappraisal, and list of claims were submitted and approved by the probate court.\n\n       Subsequently, believing that Burke was guilty of gross misconduct or gross\n\nmismanagement of the estate, Michael and Billy filed an application to remove Burke as\n\nindependent administrator.              See id. § 149C (West Supp. 2011).                The application\n       1\n           Appellate cause number 13-11-00664-CV.\n       2\n           Appellate cause number 13-11-00692-CV.\n       3\n           In particular, Bertha’s will stated in relevant part as follows:\n\n       I am asking that Linda D. Burke named here with [sic] shall act as Executrix of this Will\n       and of my estate, and be assisted by Billy F. Jones II, Michael V.C. Jones. The three to\n       work together all the way. If for any reason at all one of the above named persons is\n       unable to fulfill his or her obligations pretaining [sic] to the estate of their mother Bertha\n       Newson-Jones [sic], Full power is granted to the remaining named persons, and that [sic]\n       this document will still be legal and binding in every respect.\n\n\n                                                         2\n\fspecifically contended that Burke withdrew $111,376 from a Wells Fargo bank account\n\nthat had been funded with proceeds obtained from payable-on-death (“P.O.D.”)\n\naccounts established by Bertha for her children’s benefit.                   The application also\n\ncontended that Burke: (1) “misapplied funds” belonging to the estate; (2) “spent\n\nunnecessary funds” on maintaining certain real property belonging to the estate; (3) “is[\n\n]making no productive effort” to sell that real property; and (4) advised Michael and Billy\n\nthrough her attorney that “she was no longer going to pay current debts of the Estate\n\nand the debts could be paid by [Michael and Billy].” Burke filed an answer denying the\n\nallegations, and she then filed a plea to the jurisdiction, which the probate court denied.\n\n       A hearing was held on Michael and Billy’s application on August 31, 2011. Burke\n\nwas the only witness to testify. At the close of the hearing, Burke’s counsel orally\n\nmoved for a directed verdict; the probate court denied the motion. On September 6,\n\n2011, the probate court rendered an order granting Michael and Billy’s application and\n\nremoving Burke as independent administrator. This appeal followed.4\n\n       After the notice of appeal was filed, the probate court filed findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law. The findings of fact were as follows:\n\n       1.    That [Burke] failed to segregate estate and non-estate assets in her\n             administrations of the estate;\n\n       2.    That Burke has made gross errors in accounting for estate assets\n             and disbursements;\n\n       3.    That Burke has anticipatorily repudiated her fiduciary responsibilities\n             as Independent Administrator by refusing to pay ad valorem taxes\n             due on estate property;\n\n       4.    That Burke expended significant estate funds without doing a\n             cost/benefit analysis of the financial effects such expenditures would\n\n       4\n          This appeal was transferred from the Ninth Court of Appeals pursuant to a docket equalization\norder issued by the Texas Supreme Court. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 73.001 (West 2005).\n\n                                                  3\n\f               have on the estate;\n\n       5.      That Burke expended estate funds on personal expenses which\n               included meals;\n\n       6.      That Burke engaged in self-dealing by claiming payments from estate\n               funds for work allegedly done by her husband;\n\n       7.      That Burke displayed a gross lack of attention to accounting for and\n               documenting expenses and disbursements of estate funds;\n\n       8.      That Burke expended estate funds for non-perishable items such as\n               tools without accounting for such purchases as estate assets after\n               the date of purchase;\n\n       9.      That Burke admitted to no understanding of            her fiduciary\n               responsibilities to the estate[;]\n\n       10. That Burke’s actions showed an intent to manage the interests of the\n           estate for her own benefit rather than all beneficiaries;\n\n       11. That Burke grossly mismanaged the estate in her attempted handling\n           of the sale of the decedent’s homestead[.]\n\nThe conclusions of law included the following: “Sufficient grounds appear to support the\n\nbelief that Burke has misapplied and/or is about to misapply property committed to her\n\ncare” and “Burke is guilty of gross mismanagement of the estate in the performance of\n\nher duties.”\n\n                                       II. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n\n       By her first issue on appeal, Burke argues that the probate court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction to render the challenged order because there were “no justiciable\n\nissues” properly before the court. Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a\n\nquestion of law that we review de novo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v.

See TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 439A(b)(2) (West Supp.\n\n2011) (promulgating a form to be used by financial institutions in establishing P.O.D.\n\naccounts which states: “The party to the account owns the account. On the death of\n\nthe party, ownership of the account passes to the P.O.D. beneficiaries of the account.\n\nThe account is not a part of the party’s estate”); see also Punts v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485724\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485724/punts-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 892 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2004, no pet.). Burke argues that, because the funds\n\nin the Wells Fargo account were derived solely from Bertha’s P.O.D. accounts, “the trial\n\ncourt did not have any subject-matter jurisdiction over said proceeds and could not\n\nadjudicate any controversy concerning them.”\n\n          In support of her argument, Burke points to probate code section 145(h), which\n\nstates:\n\n          When an independent administration has been created, and the order\n          appointing an independent executor has been entered by the county court,\n          and the inventory, appraisement, and list aforesaid has been filed by the\n          executor and approved by the county court or an affidavit in lieu of the\n          inventory, appraisement, and list of claims has been filed by the executor,\n          as long as the estate is represented by an independent executor, further\n          action of any nature shall not be had in the county court except where this\n          Code specifically and explicitly provides for some action in the county\n          court.\n\nId. § 145(h). However, this statute does not categorically forbid the probate court from\n\nconducting further proceedings after an inventory, appraisal, and list of claims has been\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\ffiled; instead, it permits such further proceedings when “specifically and explicitly” called\n\nfor elsewhere in the probate code. And, section 149C of the probate code specifically\n\nand explicitly provides as follows:\n\n        The county court, as that term is defined by Section 3 of this code,[5] on its\n        own motion or on motion of any interested person, after the independent\n        executor has been cited by personal service to answer at a time and place\n        fixed in the notice, may remove an independent executor when:\n\n                ...\n\n        (2)     sufficient grounds appear to support belief that the independent\n                executor has misapplied or embezzled, or that the independent\n                executor is about to misapply or embezzle, all or any part of the\n                property committed to the independent executor’s care;\n\n                . . . [or]\n\n        (5)     the independent executor is proved to have been guilty of gross\n                misconduct or gross mismanagement in the performance of the\n                independent executor’s duties . . . .\n\nId. § 149C(a), (a)(2), (a)(5).          Burke does not dispute that Michael and Billy are\n\n“interested person[s]” or that she was properly served with citation.                         The statute\n\ntherefore clearly authorizes the probate court to exercise jurisdiction over an application,\n\nsuch as that filed by Michael and Billy, alleging that an independent administrator of an\n\nestate misapplied estate funds or exhibited gross misconduct or gross mismanagement\n\nin her duties.6\n\n\n        5\n           “‘County Court’ and ‘Probate Court’ are synonymous terms and denote county courts in the\nexercise of their probate jurisdiction, courts created by statute and authorized to exercise original probate\njurisdiction, and district courts exercising probate jurisdiction in contested matters.” TEX.

CODE\nANN. § 3(e) (West Supp. 2011).\n        6\n           Burke also contends that subject matter jurisdiction did not lie because Michael and Billy’s\napplication failed to “specifically allege facts as to how [Burke] has been guilty of gross misconduct and/or\ngross mismanagement and must specifically allege facts as to how [Burke] misapplied or embezzled\nestate funds.” This is a misstatement of the law.

This standard is more strict\nthan the one stated in Kappus in that it allows removal of an executor upon a finding of “any” willful or\nintentional malfeasance; Kappus, on the other hand, appears to require that such malfeasance also be\n“glaringly obvious” or “flagrant.” See Kappus v.

(“As an intermediate appellate court, we are bound to follow the expression of the law as\nstated by the Texas Supreme Court . . . .”).\n\n         We note that neither party, in their appellate briefs, saw fit to cite Kappus, the pre-Kappus case\nlaw, or any other law construing the applicable statute.\n\n\n                                                     8\n\fthose funds—totaling $102,000—for estate expenses because the estate did not\n\noriginally have enough cash on hand. Burke testified that she also received $31,000\n\nfrom a separate P.O.D. account. Burke testified that she opened a new bank account in\n\nthe name of the estate with all of these funds. At some point, Burke withdrew the\n\nremaining balance in the estate expense account, totaling about $75,000, and she\n\nopened a new account with those funds at Wells Fargo. With respect to the Wells\n\nFargo account, Burke was the owner and Michael, Billy, and Burke’s husband were\n\nnamed as beneficiaries.\n\n        Burke further testified that, with the assistance of an attorney, she compiled a\n\nreport of estate income and expenses covering the period from March 23, 2006 to\n\nDecember 31, 2007.8 The report, the accuracy of which was sworn to by Burke, was\n\nfiled with the probate court on March 27, 2008 and was admitted as evidence at the\n\nAugust 31, 2011 hearing. The document reflected that, during the accounting period,\n\nthe estate paid out claims in the total amount of $68,147.08 and received income in the\n\ntotal amount of $55,411.71.            The estate expenses included, among other things, a\n\n$1,134.14 payment to Burke for travel expenses, and a $4,443.43 payment to Burke for\n\n“[l]odging & [f]ood expenses.”9            The estate receipts included, among other things,\n\n$10,000 from a retirement fund of which all three parties were beneficiaries. 10 The\n\nannual account did not reflect the $133,000 that Burke testified was voluntarily\n\ncontributed by herself and her brothers for estate expenses.                           The document\n\n        8\n          Burke acknowledged that, as an independent administrator, she was not actually required to file\nan annual accounting report with the court. See TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. § 399 (West Supp. 2011)\n(requiring dependent administrators to file annual accounting reports).\n        9\n        The estate also made cash disbursements of $35,043.27, all of which was attributable to the\nupkeep and improvement of the estate’s real property.\n        10\n             Burke conceded that the proceeds from the retirement fund were not estate assets.\n\n                                                     9\n\faffirmatively stated that “[n]o property has come into the possession of the Independent\n\nExecutrix during this accounting period that has not been previously listed or inventoried\n\nas property of the estate.” Burke agreed with Michael and Billy’s counsel’s statement\n\nthat “even though this annual account says there was $55,000 that came into [t]he\n\nEstate, really there was $155,000 [sic] because of the $100,000 [sic] that the three of\n\nyou contributed[.]” The annual account stated that the estate had only $368.06 on hand\n\nat the end of the accounting period.\n\n      Also introduced into evidence was a document listing all of the administration\n\nexpenses made out-of-pocket by Burke which were not included on the annual account.\n\nThese expenses, incurred from January 21, 2006 to September 29, 2010, total\n\n$97,311.19.   Burke testified that she is asking to be reimbursed for all of these\n\nexpenses, “over and above what was already paid out of [t]he Estate.” Counsel pointed\n\nout that all but $12,578.47 of those expenses were incurred in 2006 and 2007 and that\n\nthe annual account submitted by Burke appears to state that she had already been\n\nreimbursed for those amounts.\n\n      With respect to the sale of the estate’s real property, Burke testified that she had\n\nentered into a contract with a buyer to sell the property, but the buyer reneged on the\n\ninitial agreement and instead demanded that Burke install new central air conditioning in\n\nthe house.    Burke testified that she refused to do so because the existing air\n\nconditioning unit had passed inspection. With respect to property taxes, the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n      Q.

I had taken responsibility for\n                                        paying taxes on the house. I have taken\n                                        responsibility to pay the lawn care. I\n                                        paid the house insurance, all that has\n                                        come out of my pocket and I asked if he\n                                        could do it since the house is partially\n                                        his as well.\n\n      Q.                                All right.\n\n      A.                                I knew my brother, Billy, couldn’t do it,\n                                        but I figured Michael could do it. I have\n                                        been doing it the last four years.\n\n      Q.                                But you understand as the executor it is\n                                        your job to take those certain actions\n                                        and do those things, correct?\n\n      A.                                I just asked if he could do it.\n\n      Q.                                Okay.\n\n      A.                                I did not understand it was my\n                                        responsibility as executor to pay taxes\n                                        on a house that belonged to the three of\n                                        us. No, I didn’t understand that.\n\n      After both parties rested, the probate court asked Burke about several items on\n\nthe list of administration expenses that she asked to be reimbursed for. The court noted\n\nthat “[t]here were numerous charges in 2006 and 2007 to M & D Supply and Harbor\n\nFreight, charges were for purchases of tools.” Burke explained that these purchases\n\n                                          11\n\fwere for “painting, it could have been hammers, wrenches, plumbing tools, whatever we\n\nneeded to make repairs in the house.”\n\n       Based upon the foregoing evidence, the probate court could have reasonably\n\ndetermined that Burke committed gross misconduct or gross mismanagement of the\n\nestate in her role as independent administrator, see TEX. PROB. CODE ANN. §\n\n149C(a)(5), and that such misconduct or mismanagement was “glaringly obvious” or\n\n“flagrant.” See Kappus, 284 S.W.3d at 836. In particular, the evidence supports the\n\nprobate court’s findings of fact that Burke: (1) “failed to segregate estate and non-\n\nestate assets” in her administration of the estate; (2) “anticipatorily repudiated her\n\nfiduciary responsibilities as Independent Administrator by refusing to pay ad valorem\n\ntaxes due on estate property”; (3) “expended estate funds on personal expenses”\n\nincluding meals; (4) ”displayed a gross lack of attention to accounting for and\n\ndocumenting expenses and disbursements of estate funds”; and (5) “expended estate\n\nfunds for non-perishable items such as tools without accounting for such purchases as\n\nestate assets after the date of purchase.”11\n\n       The probate court did not err in denying Burke’s motion for directed verdict. Her\n\nsecond issue is overruled.\n\nC.     Petition for Writ of Prohibition\n\n       In her petition for writ of prohibition, Burke requests that we command the\n\npresiding judge of the probate court “not to hear [Michael and Billy’s application to\n\nappoint a dependent administrator], which is scheduled for hearing on November 2,\n\n\n       11\n           In light of our conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to support the probate court’s\njudgment under probate code section 149C(a)(5), regarding gross misconduct or gross mismanagement,\nwe need not address whether the court’s judgment was also proper under section 149C(a)(2), regarding\nmisapplication or embezzlement of estate assets. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n                                                 12\n\f2011, until [Burke] has exhausted all of her appellate remedies allowed by law.” She\n\nargues that the probate court lost its plenary power to appoint a successor administrator\n\nat the time she filed her appeal. Burke also filed a motion for emergency stay of all\n\nprobate court proceedings, which we granted on November 1, 2011. Michael and Billy\n\nfiled a motion to reconsider the stay, noting that Burke “has entered into a contract to\n\nsell the [estate’s] real property and is representing that she is still the Independent\n\nExecutor of the Estate.” We granted the motion to reconsider in part and rendered an\n\norder on December 13, 2011 staying “all underlying proceedings, including any and all\n\nactions purportedly taken on behalf of the estate or by a personal representative of the\n\nestate” until further order of this Court.\n\n       Given our ruling on Burke’s two appellate issues, the issues raised in the petition\n\nfor writ of prohibition are now moot. We therefore deny the petition and lift the stay.\n\n                                       III. CONCLUSION\n\n       We affirm the judgment of the probate court. Further, Burke’s petition for writ of\n\nprohibition is denied, and any and all stays previously imposed by this Court on probate\n\ncourt proceedings or actions by purported administrators of the estate are hereby lifted\n\nin their entirety.\n\n\n\n                                                  ________________________\n                                                  DORI CONTRERAS GARZA\n                                                  Justice\n\nDelivered and filed the\n27th day of August, 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f</pre>",
