In 1991 he was\r\ntried and sentenced to death.  His sentence was affirmed on direct appeal.<sup> (1)</sup>  In 2008, this Court\r\ngranted a new punishment hearing<sup> (2)</sup> under <em>Penry II</em>.<sup> (3)</sup>  In July of 2009, appellant was again sentenced\r\nto death.  Direct appeal to this Court is automatic.<sup> (4)</sup>  Finding no reversible error, we shall affirm.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. Legal Sufficiency - Future Dangerousness</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty-four, appellant argues that the evidence is legally insufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's answer to the future dangerousness special issue because, at the time of his new\r\ntrial on punishment, he had spent eighteen years on death row with no violent infractions.  He asserts\r\nthat, because of this, it is evident that he would not constitute a continuing threat to society.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen assessing whether there is sufficient evidence of future dangerousness, we review the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury's affirmative answer and determine whether any\r\nrational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that\r\nappellant would constitute a continuing threat to society.<sup> (5)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA jury may consider a variety of factors when considering the future dangerousness issue,\r\nincluding: the circumstances of the offense, including the defendant's state of mind and whether he\r\nwas working alone or with other parties; the calculated nature of his acts; the forethought and\r\ndeliberation exhibited by the crime's execution; the existence of a prior criminal record and the\r\nseverity of the prior crimes; the defendant's age and personal circumstances at the time of the\r\noffense; whether the defendant was acting under duress or the domination of another at the time of\r\nthe offense; psychiatric evidence; and character evidence.<sup> (6)</sup>  The circumstances of an offense can be\r\nsome of the most revealing evidence of future dangerousness and may be sufficient to independently\r\nsupport an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness issue.<sup> (7)</sup>  The special issue focuses upon the\r\nparticular individual's character for violence, not merely the quantity or quality of the institutional\r\nrestraints put on that person.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the instant offense, appellant killed two people.  He ambushed nineteen-year-old Sean Hill\r\nwhile Hill was fishing, and he shot Hill's grandmother, Edna Brau, between the eyes while she slept. \r\nAfter his arrest, witnesses described him as smiling and indifferent, as if it were a joke.<sup> (9)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State presented evidence of other offenses and bad acts, including evidence that\r\nappellant, as a young teenager, brought a gun to school and threatened to shoot other students. \r\nAppellant had strangled cats and had stomped birds to death.<sup> (10)</sup>  He had also committed armed\r\nrobbery and a wide variety of drug-related offenses.<sup> (11)</sup>  While he was on deferred adjudication for an\r\naggravated robbery, appellant killed 7-Eleven store employee Jeffrey Saunders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's psychologist, Dr. Compton, testified that at the time of the offense appellant was\r\na sociopath, and at the time of trial he was still diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder, for\r\nwhich there is neither cure nor treatment.  Dr. Compton also testified that appellant exhibited\r\nnarcissism,  grandiosity, manipulative behavior and that he displayed signs of remorse for his crimes\r\nonly as his execution date drew near.  Dr. Compton agreed that the restrictive death row environment\r\nlimits anti-social behavior.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, there is sufficient evidence for a rational\r\ntrier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  Issue number twenty-four is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. Factual Sufficiency</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues twenty-five and twenty-six, appellant urges us to examine the factual sufficiency\r\nof the evidence to support the jury's answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.  This court\r\ndoes not review future dangerousness for factual sufficiency.<sup> (12)</sup>  Furthermore, we no longer conduct\r\nfactual-sufficiency analyses for issues on which the State carries the burden of proof beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.<sup> (13)</sup>  Issues twenty-five and twenty-six are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>C. Factual Sufficiency - Mitigation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirty-two and thirty-three, appellant claims that the jury's answer to the mitigation\r\nspecial issue was against the weight and preponderance of the evidence.  We do not conduct a\r\nsufficiency review of the jury's answer to the mitigation special issue.<sup> (14)</sup>  Issues thirty-two and thirty-three are overruled.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>II. <em>VOIR DIRE </em>ISSUES</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span> <strong>A. <em>Batson</em> Challenge</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number one, appellant claims that the trial court erred in overruling his <em>Batson</em><sup> (15)</sup>\r\nchallenge to the State's peremptory strike of prospective juror McClendon.  <em>Batson</em> provides a three-step process for a trial court to use in deciding a claim that a peremptory strike was based on race:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has\r\nbeen exercised on the basis of race.  Second, if that showing has been made, the\r\nprosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question.  Third,\r\nin light of the parties' submissions, the trial court must determine whether the\r\ndefendant has shown purposeful discrimination.<sup> (16)</sup>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is\r\nclearly erroneous.<sup> (17)</sup>  Often the best evidence of discriminatory intent is the demeanor of the\r\nprosecutor exercising the challenge.<sup> (18)</sup>  Step three of the <em>Batson</em> inquiry includes an evaluation of the\r\nprosecutor's credibility.<sup> (19)</sup>  Additionally, race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often turn\r\non aspects of a prospective juror's demeanor, such as nervousness or inattention, causing the trial\r\ncourt's observations to be even more important.<sup> (20)</sup>   The trial court must evaluate, not only whether\r\nthe prosecutor's demeanor shows discriminatory intent, but also whether the prospective juror's\r\ndemeanor displayed the basis for the strike.<sup> (21)</sup> A trial court may perform a comparison of accepted\r\njurors versus the challenged juror.<sup> (22)</sup>  Disparate treatment may enter into both the trial judge's\r\nassessment of the prosecutor's credibility and the determination of the racial neutrality of the\r\nperemptory challenge.<sup> (23)</sup> <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>Following McClendon's individual voir dire, the State challenged her for cause.  Appellant\r\nopposed the strike, and the court denied the challenge.  The State then used a peremptory challenge\r\nto strike McClendon from the jury. Appellant challenged the strike under <em>Batson.</em> In response, the\r\nprosecutor stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI want the record to reflect some of these statements were in her questionnaire.  She\r\nwas talking about how alcohol and drugs is a disease, with regards to the genetic\r\npredisposition.  She talked about voluntary intoxication may not be worthy of a death\r\npenalty.  Intoxication is a big issue in this case.  She talked about how most criminals\r\nare actually victims of society, and extenuating circumstances should not be\r\nconsidered.  She strongly disagreed on that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State felt she was the type of juror - any type of mitigating evidence that would\r\nhave been presented, she would have latched on to and would have answered that last\r\nspecial issue to the point where the defendant would receive a life sentence instead\r\nof the death sentence.  And that's only if she became qualified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIt was the State's position, Judge - and I think the Court can even read the transcript\r\nwith the State and Defense presented after that day, that this juror specifically said,\r\n\"No, I do not think I could take that oath.\"  And then I pressed her on it.  She said,\r\n\"No, I could not take the oath to sit as a juror in a case like this.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tObviously, the Judge made his ruling and we abided by the ruling.  But then someone\r\nwho we felt couldn't even be comfortable taking the oath and potentially sentencing\r\nsomeone to die, the State was forced to use a peremptory strike on that particular\r\njuror.  It had nothing to do with the race of the juror or the sex of the juror, it just had\r\nto do with her answers throughout her questionnaire, as well as her answers to\r\nmyself, when I was questioning her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnother point they brought up was with regards to the Karla Faye Tucker case.  She\r\nwould have given that person, who we all know, another chance and would have\r\npardoned her, she said on the record, as well.<sup> (24)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSo based on a collective of all her answers in the questionnaire, as well as her\r\nanswers to myself, as well as the fact that we still feel that she couldn't even take the\r\noath to sit on a case like this, that is the reason that the State used a peremptory\r\nchallenge on Ms. McClendon, juror 1129.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The defense made no attempt to rebut the State's race-neutral explanation and made no further\r\ncomment.  The court denied appellant's <em>Batson </em>challenge. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA comparison of McClendon's responses to those of persons acceptable to the State fails to\r\nrefute the State's race-neutral explanation.  Appellant urges that several jurors accepted by the State\r\nwanted to hear any and all mitigating evidence, and that others were concerned about the gravity of\r\nthe decision or might consider intoxication to be a mitigating circumstance.  None of the accepted\r\njurors expressed all of these feelings in concert, nor to the degree that McClendon did. Moreover,\r\nMcClendon was the only one to say that she would be unable to take the oath of a juror, which is the\r\ninitial reason that the State attempted to strike her for cause.  \t\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's ruling, we cannot\r\nconclude that the trial court's ruling on the peremptory strike of prospective juror McClendon was\r\nclearly erroneous.  Issue one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. Challenges for Cause</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues two through sixteen, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying appellant's\r\nchallenges for cause against certain prospective jurors.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo show harm when a challenge for cause is denied, appellant must demonstrate that, on the\r\nrecord, he: 1) asserted a clear and specific challenge for cause; 2) used a peremptory challenge on\r\nthe complained-of prospective juror; 3) exhausted all of his peremptory challenges; 4) requested\r\nadditional strikes and was denied;  and 5) identified an objectionable juror who served on the jury.<sup> (25)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the record shows that appellant exhausted his peremptory challenges and\r\nreceived one additional peremptory challenge.  In order to show harm, appellant must demonstrate\r\nthat the trial court erroneously denied his challenge to two complained-of prospective jurors.<sup> (26)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review a trial court's ruling on a challenge for cause with considerable deference because\r\nthe trial court is in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror's demeanor and responses.<sup> (27)</sup> \r\nThis is particularly so when the challenged prospective juror vacillates or seems confused.<sup> (28)</sup>  When\r\nreviewing a trial court's decision on a challenge for cause, we look at the entire record of voir dire\r\nto determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling.<sup> (29)</sup>  We will reverse a trial\r\ncourt's ruling on a challenge for cause only if an abuse of discretion is evident.<sup> (30)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA prospective juror may be challenged for cause for bias against any phase of the law upon\r\nwhich the State or the defendant is entitled to rely.<sup> (31)</sup>  Bias against the law is refusal to consider or\r\napply the relevant law.<sup> (32)</sup>  A prospective juror is biased when his beliefs or opinions would prevent\r\nor substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions\r\nand oath.<sup> (33)</sup>  However, before a prospective juror can be excused for cause on this basis, the law must\r\nbe explained to him and he must be asked whether he can follow that law regardless of his personal\r\nviews.<sup> (34)</sup>  The proponent of a challenge for cause does not meet his burden until he has shown that\r\nthe prospective juror understood the requirement of the law and could not overcome his prejudice\r\nwell enough to follow it.<sup> (35)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number two, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for\r\ncause against prospective juror Westlund.  At trial, appellant objected to Westlund because she\r\nwould shift the burden of proof on mitigation to the defense; thus, she would not be able to follow\r\nthe oath required of a juror.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo burden of proof exists for either appellant or the State on mitigation.<sup> (36)</sup>  Appellant bears\r\na burden of production on mitigation, however.<sup> (37)</sup>  It was not clear from Westlund's answers that she\r\nunderstood this distinction.  An examination of the record shows that this distinction was not\r\nexplained to her, nor was she asked if, understanding the law, she could set aside her personal views\r\nand follow the law.  Moreover, a prospective juror is not challengeable for cause \"simply because\r\nhe would place the burden of proof on mitigation on the defense.\"<sup> (38)</sup>  The record does not indicate\r\nany abuse of discretion in denying the challenge.  Issue number two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues number three, four, and six through fifteen appellant claims that the trial court erred\r\nin denying his challenges for cause against prospective jurors Slaten, Arnett, Massey, Combs-Hollie,\r\nDent, Spurger,<sup> (39)</sup> Donihoo, Stanberry, Wetzel, Williams, Wallin<sup> (40)</sup> and Stanford.  Citing Justice\r\nScalia's dissent in <em>Morgan v. Illinois</em><sup> (41)</sup> for support, appellant objected that these prospective jurors\r\n\"[could] not give equal consideration to Mr. Robertson's mitigation, given the facts.\"  Because\r\nappellant expected to introduce certain types of evidence that these prospective jurors indicated that\r\nthey would not find mitigating, appellant argues that these prospective jurors were biased against\r\nhim, his evidence, and the law on which he would rely, and were incapable of taking the juror's oath. \r\nAppellant submitted a written objection and argument on these grounds, referred to as \"Trial\r\nObjection Number 1.\"  Later challenges based on this ground were sometimes simply communicated\r\nto the court as challenges based on \"trial objection one.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>   \tIn <em>Standefer v. State</em>, we held that \"a prospective juror is not challengeable for cause simply\r\nbecause he does not consider a particular type of evidence to be mitigating.\"<sup> (42)</sup>  \"[W]hether a\r\nprospective juror considers a particular type of evidence to be mitigating is not a proper area of\r\ninquiry.\"<sup> (43)</sup>  Also, a prospective juror is not required to give an example of something that he would\r\nconsider mitigating.<sup> (44)</sup>  Issues three, four, and six through fifteen are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number sixteen, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his challenge\r\nfor cause against prospective juror Jordan on the basis of trial objection number one. As explained\r\nabove, a juror is not required to find any particular evidence to be mitigating.  Appellant also argues\r\nin his brief that Jordan would automatically find appellant to be a future danger.  Appellant did not\r\nallege this reason as part of his challenge to the trial court.  To preserve error, a complaining party\r\nmust make a timely and specific request, objection or motion and obtain a ruling from the trial\r\ncourt.<sup> (45)</sup>  This claim was not preserved for appeal.<sup> (46)</sup>  Moreover, when the law was clarified to him,\r\nJordan stated that he would require the State to prove future dangerousness beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.  Issue number sixteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number nineteen, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying trial objection\r\nnumber one as to each member of the venire.  As explained above, this court has held that a\r\nprospective juror is not challengeable for cause simply because he does not consider a particular type\r\nof evidence to be mitigating, and whether a juror considers a particular type of evidence mitigating\r\nis not a proper area of inquiry.<sup> (47)</sup>   Issue number nineteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty-one, appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his\r\nobjection to the unconstitutionality of the jury selection process as a whole.   He asserts that because\r\nthe trial court denied his strikes for cause against jurors who \"[could] not consider Mr. Robertson's\r\nmitigation evidence,\" the jury was unconstitutionally formed, denying him due process and a fair\r\ntrial.   Appellant argues that state judges in Texas are not adequately trained in applying federal law\r\nin death-penalty cases, that the trial court did not correctly apply the law in this case, and that this\r\nled to an unconstitutional jury in appellant's case.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis amounts to a claim that, because the trial court overruled trial objection number one,\r\nthe jury was unconstitutionally formed.  <em>Morgan</em> provides that a juror who will automatically vote\r\nfor the death penalty may be removed for cause.<sup> (48)</sup>  It does not require a commitment to believe any\r\nparticular type of evidence to be  mitigating.<sup> (49)</sup>  As explained above, a prospective juror is not\r\nchallengeable for cause simply because he may or may not consider any particular type of evidence\r\nto be mitigating.<sup> (50)</sup>  Further, whether a juror considers a particular type of evidence to be mitigating\r\nis not a proper area of inquiry.<sup> (51)</sup>  Thus, a trial court does not err by refusing to allow a defendant to\r\nask prospective jurors questions based on facts peculiar to the case on trial.<sup> (52)</sup>  All that the law\r\nrequires is that a defendant be allowed to present relevant mitigating evidence and that the jury be\r\nprovided a vehicle to give effect to that evidence if the jury finds it to be mitigating.<sup> (53)</sup>  A review of\r\nthe record and the preceding issues demonstrates that the trial court did not err in its rulings.  Issue\r\ntwenty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number five, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for\r\ncause against prospective juror Murphy.  Appellant objected that Murphy was biased against him and\r\nwould not consider his, nor any other, mitigating evidence.  In a conference out of Murphy's\r\npresence, the parties agreed that the court should further question him. Subsequently, the court\r\nrecalled Murphy and questioned him directly about his ability to be fair and impartial, and follow\r\nthe law.  The court asked: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWould you be predisposed to not consider any mitigating evidence?  Or can you keep\r\nan open mind?  Can you consider any evidence that might be presented by either side,\r\nunderstanding that neither side has the burden of proof?  Or something you've heard\r\nthrough the course of the trial that you thought was sufficient-mitigating\r\ncircumstance, [sic] to extend a life sentence to the defendant rather than the death\r\npenalty and answer the question 'yes' - and that's what the law would require you\r\nto do.  Can you do that?  If you can't, then you need to tell us you can't.  If you can,\r\nthen you need to tell us you can.  Only you know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMurphy responded that yes, he could consider the mitigation issue, and the challenge for\r\ncause was denied.  After examining the entire record, and in light of the appropriate deference to the\r\ntrial court's ruling, we do not find an abuse of discretion in denying this challenge.  Issue number\r\nfive is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues number seventeen and eighteen, appellant contends that the erroneous denial of his\r\nchallenges for cause detailed above deprived him of a lawfully constituted, unbiased, and\r\nunprejudiced group of jurors. He claims that this denied him a fair trial in violation of the United\r\nStates Constitution, the Texas Constitution and the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.   These\r\nobjections were not presented to the trial court; thus they are not preserved for review.  We further\r\nnote that none of the denied challenges for cause that appellant complains of were erroneous.  Issues\r\nseventeen and eighteen are overruled.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying \"trial objection\r\nnumber two\" as to each and every member of the venire.  Trial objection number two is a written\r\nobjection to \"improper exclusion of [a] juror with scruples against death\"<sup> (54)</sup> and appellant was\r\nallowed a running objection on this basis.  Appellant does not now argue that any jurors were\r\nimproperly excluded on this basis, nor does he argue that he was harmed.  Appellant's brief pairs the\r\nargument for this issue with the argument for issue nineteen, but it does not argue any issue\r\npresented in trial objection number two; thus this claim is inadequately briefed.<sup> (55)</sup>  Issue number\r\ntwenty is overruled.\t\t<strong>III.  TRIAL ISSUES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. False Testimony</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues twenty-two and twenty-three, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying\r\nhis motion for new trial, and for denying him a fair trial and due process in violation of the Fifth,\r\nSixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  He asserts that the\r\nState knowingly presented false and highly misleading testimony about appellant's future\r\ndangerousness.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDue process is offended when the State knowingly or unknowingly offers material evidence\r\nthat is false or misleading .<sup> (56)</sup>  An examination of the evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that it\r\nwas neither false nor misleading - thus we need not address its materiality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State called Warden Melodye Nelson as an expert witness about future dangerousness. \r\nWarden Nelson described how an inmate's living conditions are restricted through the use of a\r\nclassification system ranking inmates from G1 (least restrictive) through G5 (most restrictive) and\r\nadministrative segregation.  Appellant complains about the warden's statements concerning the\r\nfollowing: that appellant would automatically be classified as a G3 inmate; that prison personnel are \r\nunderpaid and short staffed, that one officer may look after 150 inmates, and that a year previously\r\nthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice was 4,000 officers short; that there is more violence in the\r\ngeneral population than in administrative segregation; that inmates can come and go from their cells\r\nto work; and that prison is filled with psychopaths.  At appellant's hearing on the motion for new\r\ntrial, appellant presented experts S.O. Woods and Dr. Mark Vigen, whose testimony was intended\r\nto counter the warden's testimony and show that her testimony was false or misleading.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough appellant did not object to this testimony contemporaneously, the trial court granted\r\na hearing on the motion.  Assuming, without deciding, that appellant's complaints were preserved,\r\nwe will address the issues.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>1.  Appellant would automatically be classified as a G3 inmate.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWarden Nelson testified at trial that if appellant were sentenced to life with parole (under the\r\nlaw in effect at the time of his conviction) he would be automatically classified as a G3 prisoner, a\r\nclassification including any offender sentenced to fifty years or more who had not served at least ten\r\nyears.  She further testified that after ten years a G3 inmate would be eligible for promotion to G2\r\nstatus.  Because appellant's disciplinary record during the eighteen years he spent on death row\r\ncontained only minor infractions, the warden stated that he would automatically be categorized as\r\na G2 if given a life sentence.  At the hearing on the motion for new trial, the State also presented an\r\naffidavit from Cay Cannon, a member of the State Classification Committee, opining that appellant\r\nwould be classified as a G2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Woods stated that, \"As far as the G3 being an automatic, that's the rule of\r\nthumb for any sentence over fifty years, new inmate less than ten years of service time, those kinds\r\nof factors.\"  He disagreed with Warden Nelson's use of the word \"automatic,\" stating that it \"was\r\nnot a good choice of words.\" He explained that although TDCJ uses software that automatically\r\ndetermines an offender's status, TDCJ personnel may override this classification if there are reasons\r\nto do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough Woods disagreed with the warden's choice of words, the evidence indicates that\r\nappellant was eligible for G2 status if given a life sentence.  Further, analysis of appellant's\r\ndisciplinary record by the experts showed no reason that the automatic classification produced by\r\nTDCJ software would have been overridden by TDCJ classification personnel.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>2.  Prison personnel are underpaid and short staffed, that an officer may look after 150 inmates,\r\nand that a year previously TDCJ was 4000 officers short.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWarden Nelson testified that TDCJ employees are underpaid, stating that an entry-level\r\ncorrectional officer received \"about the same as what a Wal-Mart warehouse worker [did].\"  She also\r\nindicated that there was rapid turnover, chronic under-staffing, and that \"one staff member may be\r\nin charge of up to 150 offenders.\"  She explained that because of this it was difficult to keep control\r\nover inmate access to contraband.  She also explained that although she did not know the current\r\nfigure, TDCJ was short 4,000 personnel the year before, and this shortage was not evenly distributed\r\nthroughout the system.  Rather, some units were very short-staffed, particularly in remote areas.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWoods testified that his investigation did not turn up anyone at TDCJ who agreed that one\r\nguard supervising 150 inmates was a typical situation.  He stated that using current TDCJ\r\nemployment figures and inmate figures, he calculated that there was approximately one guard for\r\nevery eight inmates and that the worst case was one guard for every eighteen inmates, but \"the fact\r\nis that TDC [sic] is such a complex operation and it consists of so many different variety of units that\r\nit's impossible to come up with anything like a ratio that says there's so many officers to so many\r\ninmates.\"  He stated that there were occasions where inmates would be under \"indirect supervision\"\r\nsuch as in chow halls or in a recreation yard \"where one or two or three officers might supervise\r\nlarge groups of inmates.\"   Woods acknowledged that he did not know about the 4,000 figure of two\r\nyears before, but that as of two weeks before, TDCJ was short 900 officers.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the warden's testimony referred to a specific time period, and because there is no\r\nevidence of any inaccuracy in the warden's statement, there is no reason to believe that any juror was\r\nconfused or misled by her testimony about TDCJ staffing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>3.  General population has more violence than administrative segregation.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWarden Nelson testified at trial that incidents of violence were more prevalent in general\r\npopulation than in administrative segregation or death row.   Woods testified at the hearing that\r\nalthough he cannot refute the warden's statements statistically, \"It's common sense\" that those\r\ninmates on administrative segregation are more dangerous.  Woods agreed, however, that simply\r\nbecause of the size of the general population, there is more opportunity for violence, concluding that\r\nthe warden's testimony did not give a false impression about the amount or nature of violence in\r\nprison.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts that Warden Nelson's testimony was misleading but does not suggest how\r\nit was so.  Although appellant's expert might have delivered the information differently, the\r\ntestimony itself did not give the jury a false impression.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>4.  Inmates can come and go from their cells to work.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the following exchange occurred between defense counsel and Warden Nelson:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   Now, when these people who were work-eligible in the G3s, who have some sort\r\nof a job somewhere in the system, they don't get up in the morning after the alarm\r\ngoes off, walk out of their cell, walk out into the hallway and go to wherever it is\r\nthey've got a job, do they?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   They do?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   And how -- how are they controlled at all then, if they can have that much\r\nfreedom?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Well, I'll give you a for instance.  Let's say they work in the laundry.  What\r\nwould happen is, the  laundry staff would call that particular housing area and tell\r\nthem to turn out all of the laundry workers.  The staff that's working that particular\r\nliving area has what we call a turn-out roster or roster.  They'll make a verbal call: \r\n\"All first-shift laundry workers, get up and go to work.\"  You know, get ready for\r\nwork.  They'll turn 'em out. Say, \"Okay.  We're going to open all your cell doors. \r\nAll you laundry workers be at the doors and you all step out.\"  They go and close all\r\nthe doors.  They check 'em off, and then they leave the building.  In some cases, staff\r\nwill call and say, \"Tell laundry, hey, I got 'em coming at you.\"  Or they would get\r\nbusy turning out kitchen workers and not tell the laundry they had ten coming, and\r\nthen they would just walk to the laundry.  And that's the process for all general\r\npopulation basic offenders who go to work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Q.   Well, that's what I'm saying:  There are people who are trying to keep up with\r\nthem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.  We track them out the door.  Yeah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   Right.  And they're  supposed to wind up where they're  supposed to wind up. \r\nOtherwise, you know that - or you should know about that, right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   We wouldn't know it until a count time showed up and one of 'em wasn't where\r\nhe was  supposed to be.  Or they called and - you know, they got down there to the\r\nlaundry, laundry officer checks 'em all in and maybe an inmate that's on his tracking\r\nroster isn't there.  He calls that living area and says, \"Where is inmate Joe? Well, he\r\nturned out?\" And then it's a process of trying to figure out where he stopped in the\r\nprocess.  Did he go by the medical department?  Did he stop in the education\r\ndepartment?  So we would have a process of elimination, to try and find his physical\r\nwhereabouts.  And we do counts eight times in a 24-hour period. So somewhere in\r\nthat process, we would be able to find his whereabouts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   That's what I'm saying:  You're keeping up with these people.  I mean, they're\r\nnot, willy-nilly, roaming around on their own, like you would when you were\r\nworking at a 7-Eleven out in the free world:  you get up and go inside the 7-Eleven.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   They're all inside the perimeter fence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   And you watch your count.  You worry about it, when they're missing, and then\r\nyou go find 'em.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen, at the hearing on the motion for new trial,  Woods was asked to describe how inmates\r\nmove from their cells to their assignments, he replied:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWell, prison in Texas is one of the most structured organizations you'll ever see. \r\nInmates are accounted for constantly.  They're physically counted at least once every\r\nshift.  Usually, a lot more than that. They all have assigned housing areas.  They have\r\nassigned jobs.  They have assigned schools.  Everything that they do is dictated to\r\nthem.  So, naturally, their turn-out list of all the housing areas that - say inmate Joe\r\nis going to go to this place.  There's going to be a person at the other end expecting\r\nhim.  When he doesn't show up, somebody's going to go looking for him.  So if you\r\ngo onto a unit and walk through a facility, yeah, there's lots of inmates moving up\r\nand down the halls, out in the yards and doing various things.  But they all have\r\ndestinations.  And that movement is controlled.  The hallways are single-file. \r\nThere's no grouping of inmates or stopping to talk and visit.  Those kind of things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis testimony is substantially identical to that presented by the warden at trial. Woods's\r\ntestimony does not establish that the warden's testimony was false or misleading.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>5.  Prison is filled with psychopaths.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the prosecution attempted to introduce evidence about the frequency and type of\r\nviolence in TDCJ generally.  Defense counsel objected to the document's relevance, stating that \"the\r\nlaw requires individualized punishment\" and that \"[appellant] can't help it if there are a bunch of\r\npsychopaths in prison.\"  Defense counsel's objection was sustained, and examination of Warden\r\nNelson continued discussing opportunities for violence in the general population.  The prosecutor\r\nlater asked Nelson, \"I think defense characterized the prison as filled with psychopaths.  Do you\r\nremember that?\"  The  warden replied that she did.  The prosecutor asked if she agreed with that, and\r\nthe warden replied, \"Yes, sir.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Woods testified that there are probably more psychopaths in prison but that\r\nit would be inaccurate to say that every inmate is a psychopath.  This testimony contradicts neither\r\ndefense counsel's characterization of prison as being filled with psychopaths nor the warden's\r\nagreement.  Moreover, appellant opened the door to the question by making the comment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant has not demonstrated that Warden Nelson's testimony was false or misleading. \r\nFurthermore, he has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new\r\ntrial.  Issues twenty-two and twenty-three are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B.  Confrontation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty-seven, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by allowing the State\r\nto read testimony by witnesses from the original trial who are now deceased and unavailable for\r\ncross-examination.  Appellant claims that because the law of mitigation has developed since the\r\noriginal trial, defense counsel at the original trial did not understand what mitigation was.  Thus, he\r\nclaims, defense counsel could not have conducted effective cross-examination to develop mitigation\r\nevidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause states that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the\r\naccused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with witnesses against him.\"<sup> (57)</sup>  Generally, prior\r\ntestimony is admissible only if a witness is unavailable and if the defendant had the opportunity to\r\ncross-examine the witness.<sup> (58)</sup>  Texas Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1) permits the use of prior testimony\r\nin criminal cases if the defendant had a similar motive to develop testimony. Generally, \"when the\r\nparties, the charge, and the issues to be litigated are the same in the first and second trials, the two\r\nproceedings are necessarily the same and former testimony is admissible.\"<sup> (59)</sup>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt this re-trial, appellant objected to the admission of the prior testimony of Milton Gish and\r\nGene Lahourkade, both of whom testified at the 1991 capital murder trial.  Gish was unavailable\r\nbecause he was dead, and Lahourkade's mental and physical condition prevented him from\r\ntestifying.  Both witnesses were available for cross-examination at the initial trial.  The record from\r\nthat trial shows that defense counsel was well aware of the mitigation issue.  Contrary to appellant's\r\nclaim that mitigation \"didn't really exist much back when this case was tried,\" <em>Penry I<sup> (60)</sup></em></span><span> had\r\nrecognized the issue two years before the first trial, and appellant's original trial was replete with\r\nmitigation evidence.  Defense counsel at the original trial had a motive to present mitigation\r\nevidence similar to counsel at re-trial. Whether appellant would have conducted the same cross-examination now does not affect that motive.<sup> (61)</sup>  The trial court did not err in admitting the prior\r\ntestimony.  Issue twenty-seven is overruled.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>C. Confessions</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues twenty-eight and twenty-nine, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting his oral and written confessions to police.  In appellant's 1991 trial, defense counsel\r\nmoved to suppress his statements to police; this motion was denied after a hearing.  In his present\r\ntrial, defense counsel re-urged the objections presented at the original trial, and the trial court\r\nresponded, \"[T]he evidence that came in is still in.  The objections originally made to that evidence\r\nare still valid objections and are preserved for appellate purposes.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAssuming, without deciding, that this was a specific, timely objection, sufficient to preserve\r\nerror, if any, we will address his claim.  As we stated in our earlier opinion on direct appeal,<sup> (62)</sup>\r\nappellant's oral confession was admitted under Article 38.22, section 3(c) of the Texas Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure, which provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSubsection (a) of this section shall not apply to any statement which contains\r\nassertions of facts or circumstances that are found to be true and which conduce to\r\nestablish the guilt of the accused, such as the finding of secreted or stolen property\r\nor the instrument with which he states the offense was committed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>We also stated that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe only warnings which must precede an oral confession admitted under section\r\n3(c) are the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. In this instance, appellant informed Sergeant Medina\r\nof the crime, as well as the crime weapon and its location. Appellant confessed to the\r\nsergeant that he had used a .38 caliber pistol, that he had stolen the gun from a car\r\nparked at a club in Dallas, and that the gun was in a jewelry box on the floor board\r\nin the back seat of the stolen blue Cadillac. Pursuant to appellant's directions, the\r\nNevada police officers located the alleged murder weapon. That weapon was\r\nidentified by Texas forensic authorities as the murder weapon. Because the\r\nconfession contains assertions of facts which were found to be true and which help\r\nestablish appellant's guilt, the confession was admissible under article 38.22, section\r\n3(c) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.<sup> (63)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence at the 1991 trial showed that appellant was properly warned as required by\r\n<em>Miranda</em>; thus, appellant's oral statements were admissible.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurthermore, although appellant asserts that his written statement is inadmissible as well, an\r\nexamination of the record shows that the written statement met all the requirements of Article 38.22,\r\nsection 2 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.  Issues twenty-eight and twenty-nine are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>D.  Extraneous Conduct Notice</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue thirty, appellant claims that the trial court erred by allowing Terry Barron to testify\r\nbecause she was not on the State's extraneous offense list.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State called Terry Barron as a rebuttal witness after appellant's witness testified that he\r\nwas \"always a good kid and serious round them.\"  Appellant objected that Barron was not on the\r\nwitness list and that there was no notice of intent to introduce her testimony about an extraneous act. \r\nThe State explained that it brought Barron in to rebut appellant's mitigation witnesses, it had not\r\nplanned to put her on the stand until a few days before, and it had immediately notified defense\r\ncounsel about Barron and the substance of her testimony.  The trial court overruled the objection and\r\nallowed Barron to testify. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.0711 provides that evidence may be presented\r\n\"as to any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence.\"<sup> (64)</sup>  Article 37.0711 is identical in this\r\nrespect to a previous iteration of Article 37.071 that we have held did not require notice of\r\nextraneous bad acts.<sup> (65)</sup>  Thus, under 37.0711 extraneous-conduct evidence is admissible at the\r\npunishment phase of a capital trial absent a showing of unfair surprise.<sup> (66)</sup>  Although appellant refers\r\nto Barron as a surprise witness, he does not show that he was unfairly surprised.  Furthermore, as we\r\nstated in <em>Jaubert</em>: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[W]hen the State presents extraneous offense evidence in rebuttal to mitigation\r\nevidence offered by the defendant, advance notice of intent to offer the extraneous\r\noffense evidence is not possible: In such a situation, the defendant, rather than the\r\nState, determines whether a contested issue will be raised, and his determination will\r\nnot be made known until he presents his case. It would be practically impossible for\r\nthe State to give notice until that time.<sup> (67)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBarron's testimony was offered in rebuttal to mitigation evidence suggesting that appellant\r\nvalued human life.<sup> (68)</sup>  The State provided notice immediately upon deciding to use Barron's\r\ntestimony.  Issue thirty is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>E.  Sidebar Comment</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue thirty-one, appellant claims that the trial court erred by not declaring a mistrial after\r\na sidebar comment by the prosecutor during Barron's testimony. While Barron testified about her\r\nbackground, appellant objected to the relevance of her testimony.  The State replied, \"Judge, I have\r\nno problem, we're going to get there.  But I think that the jury is allowed to know somebody who's\r\nlived through what she has lived through, has not killed three people.\"  Appellant objected to the\r\nState's sidebar comment, and the court sustained the objection.  Later on, appellant re-urged his\r\nobjection, and it was again sustained, whereupon he asked for a mistrial.  After an off-the-record\r\ndiscussion, the following exchange occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourt: Okay.  Back on the record.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tState:  May I proceed, Judge?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourt: Just a moment.  There's been an objection by the defense.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant: Can I carry that for a moment and talk - decide how I want to do that?\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourt: All right.  Proceed.  In the meantime, we'll continue with testimony.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant: Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barron's testimony continued, and she was eventually released.  After another witness was called\r\nand released, appellant told the court:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor the record, I want to clear up an objection, Your Honor, I made earlier in the\r\ntestimony of Terry Barron.  I had objected to the testimony of Ms. Barron's brother's\r\nhorrible childhood, as being sort of mitigating evidence.  And the prosecutor made\r\na comment that she did not kill anybody.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI would ask the court to instruct the jury to disregard all the testimony and the\r\ncomment of the assistant district attorney, regarding her horrible background.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court then instructed the jury to disregard the State's sidebar comment and denied\r\nappellant's subsequent request for a mistrial.<sup> (69)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review a trial court's denial of a motion for mistrial under an abuse-of-discretion\r\nstandard.<sup> (70)</sup>   The purpose of an instruction to disregard is to cure any harm or prejudice resulting\r\nfrom events that have already occurred.<sup> (71)</sup>  Where the prejudice is curable, an instruction to disregard\r\neliminates the need for a mistrial.<sup> (72)</sup>  A mistrial is required only if \"the objectionable events are so\r\nemotionally inflammatory that curative instructions are not likely to prevent the jury from being\r\nunfairly prejudiced against the defendant.\"<sup> (73)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the alleged inflammatory event was the State's remark to the judge in a sidebar\r\nresponse to appellant's objections, not a statement intended for the jury.  Defense counsel\r\nimmediately objected to the State's comment, and the trial court ruled in appellant's favor.  Defense\r\ncounsel did not request a mistrial at this time.  It was not until appellant asked to clear up his\r\nobjection, after an intervening witness, that a mistrial was requested and an adverse ruling obtained. \r\nAssuming that this served as a timely objection, this sort of sidebar remark is curable through an\r\ninstruction to disregard.<sup> (74)</sup>  We find that the trial court's instruction to disregard sufficed to prevent\r\nthe jury from being unfairly prejudiced by the State's comment about Barron.  Issue thirty overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>IV.  DEATH-PENALTY ISSUES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirty-two through forty-four, appellant presents several challenges to the\r\nconstitutionality of Texas death penalty law.  He acknowledges that these issues have been decided\r\nadversely to his position in the past and invites us to reconsider our holdings.  We decline to do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue thirty-six, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to preclude\r\nthe death penalty as a punishment option because state law does not provide a method for\r\ndetermining the death-worthiness of a defendant.

Barron's testimony would be admissible under the present iteration of Article 37.071 as\r\nwell.  The current version of Article 37.071 states in relevant part that the introduction of extraneous\r\nconduct evidence at the punishment phase of a capital case is governed by the notice requirements\r\nof Section 3(g), Article 37.07.  Under its plain language, Article 37.07 § 3(g) incorporates by\r\nreference Rule 404(b)'s manner of giving notice.  Rule 404(b) requires notice before extraneous\r\ncrimes or bad acts are admissible in the State's case-in-chief.  Thus, we explained in <em>Jaubert,</em> Article\r\n37.07's notice requirement applies to evidence of acts introduced during the State's case-in-chief. \r\nBy extension, since Article 37.071 incorporates the notice requirements of Article 37.07, which in\r\nturn incorporates the notice requirements Rule 404(b), Article 37.071's notice requirements apply\r\nonly to evidence of extraneous offenses or bad acts introduced during the State's case-in-chief on\r\npunishment.\r\n</p><p>69.

In 1991 he was\r\ntried and sentenced to death.  His sentence was affirmed on direct appeal.<sup> (1)</sup>  In 2008, this Court\r\ngranted a new punishment hearing<sup> (2)</sup> under <em>Penry II</em>.<sup> (3)</sup>  In July of 2009, appellant was again sentenced\r\nto death.  Direct appeal to this Court is automatic.<sup> (4)</sup>  Finding no reversible error, we shall affirm.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>I. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. Legal Sufficiency - Future Dangerousness</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty-four, appellant argues that the evidence is legally insufficient to\r\nsupport the jury's answer to the future dangerousness special issue because, at the time of his new\r\ntrial on punishment, he had spent eighteen years on death row with no violent infractions.  He asserts\r\nthat, because of this, it is evident that he would not constitute a continuing threat to society.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen assessing whether there is sufficient evidence of future dangerousness, we review the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the jury's affirmative answer and determine whether any\r\nrational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that\r\nappellant would constitute a continuing threat to society.<sup> (5)</sup> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA jury may consider a variety of factors when considering the future dangerousness issue,\r\nincluding: the circumstances of the offense, including the defendant's state of mind and whether he\r\nwas working alone or with other parties; the calculated nature of his acts; the forethought and\r\ndeliberation exhibited by the crime's execution; the existence of a prior criminal record and the\r\nseverity of the prior crimes; the defendant's age and personal circumstances at the time of the\r\noffense; whether the defendant was acting under duress or the domination of another at the time of\r\nthe offense; psychiatric evidence; and character evidence.<sup> (6)</sup>  The circumstances of an offense can be\r\nsome of the most revealing evidence of future dangerousness and may be sufficient to independently\r\nsupport an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness issue.<sup> (7)</sup>  The special issue focuses upon the\r\nparticular individual's character for violence, not merely the quantity or quality of the institutional\r\nrestraints put on that person.<sup> (8)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the instant offense, appellant killed two people.  He ambushed nineteen-year-old Sean Hill\r\nwhile Hill was fishing, and he shot Hill's grandmother, Edna Brau, between the eyes while she slept. \r\nAfter his arrest, witnesses described him as smiling and indifferent, as if it were a joke.<sup> (9)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State presented evidence of other offenses and bad acts, including evidence that\r\nappellant, as a young teenager, brought a gun to school and threatened to shoot other students. \r\nAppellant had strangled cats and had stomped birds to death.<sup> (10)</sup>  He had also committed armed\r\nrobbery and a wide variety of drug-related offenses.<sup> (11)</sup>  While he was on deferred adjudication for an\r\naggravated robbery, appellant killed 7-Eleven store employee Jeffrey Saunders.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's psychologist, Dr. Compton, testified that at the time of the offense appellant was\r\na sociopath, and at the time of trial he was still diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder, for\r\nwhich there is neither cure nor treatment.  Dr. Compton also testified that appellant exhibited\r\nnarcissism,  grandiosity, manipulative behavior and that he displayed signs of remorse for his crimes\r\nonly as his execution date drew near.  Dr. Compton agreed that the restrictive death row environment\r\nlimits anti-social behavior.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, there is sufficient evidence for a rational\r\ntrier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would commit\r\ncriminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.  Issue number twenty-four is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. Factual Sufficiency</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues twenty-five and twenty-six, appellant urges us to examine the factual sufficiency\r\nof the evidence to support the jury's answer to the future-dangerousness special issue.  This court\r\ndoes not review future dangerousness for factual sufficiency.<sup> (12)</sup>  Furthermore, we no longer conduct\r\nfactual-sufficiency analyses for issues on which the State carries the burden of proof beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.<sup> (13)</sup>  Issues twenty-five and twenty-six are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>C. Factual Sufficiency - Mitigation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirty-two and thirty-three, appellant claims that the jury's answer to the mitigation\r\nspecial issue was against the weight and preponderance of the evidence.  We do not conduct a\r\nsufficiency review of the jury's answer to the mitigation special issue.<sup> (14)</sup>  Issues thirty-two and thirty-three are overruled.<strong><em></em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>II. <em>VOIR DIRE </em>ISSUES</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span> <strong>A. <em>Batson</em> Challenge</strong></span><span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number one, appellant claims that the trial court erred in overruling his <em>Batson</em><sup> (15)</sup>\r\nchallenge to the State's peremptory strike of prospective juror McClendon.  <em>Batson</em> provides a three-step process for a trial court to use in deciding a claim that a peremptory strike was based on race:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFirst, a defendant must make a prima facie showing that a peremptory challenge has\r\nbeen exercised on the basis of race.  Second, if that showing has been made, the\r\nprosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question.  Third,\r\nin light of the parties' submissions, the trial court must determine whether the\r\ndefendant has shown purposeful discrimination.<sup> (16)</sup>\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA trial court's ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is\r\nclearly erroneous.<sup> (17)</sup>  Often the best evidence of discriminatory intent is the demeanor of the\r\nprosecutor exercising the challenge.<sup> (18)</sup>  Step three of the <em>Batson</em> inquiry includes an evaluation of the\r\nprosecutor's credibility.<sup> (19)</sup>  Additionally, race-neutral reasons for peremptory challenges often turn\r\non aspects of a prospective juror's demeanor, such as nervousness or inattention, causing the trial\r\ncourt's observations to be even more important.<sup> (20)</sup>   The trial court must evaluate, not only whether\r\nthe prosecutor's demeanor shows discriminatory intent, but also whether the prospective juror's\r\ndemeanor displayed the basis for the strike.<sup> (21)</sup> A trial court may perform a comparison of accepted\r\njurors versus the challenged juror.<sup> (22)</sup>  Disparate treatment may enter into both the trial judge's\r\nassessment of the prosecutor's credibility and the determination of the racial neutrality of the\r\nperemptory challenge.<sup> (23)</sup> <em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><em>\t</em>Following McClendon's individual voir dire, the State challenged her for cause.  Appellant\r\nopposed the strike, and the court denied the challenge.  The State then used a peremptory challenge\r\nto strike McClendon from the jury. Appellant challenged the strike under <em>Batson.</em> In response, the\r\nprosecutor stated:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI want the record to reflect some of these statements were in her questionnaire.  She\r\nwas talking about how alcohol and drugs is a disease, with regards to the genetic\r\npredisposition.  She talked about voluntary intoxication may not be worthy of a death\r\npenalty.  Intoxication is a big issue in this case.  She talked about how most criminals\r\nare actually victims of society, and extenuating circumstances should not be\r\nconsidered.  She strongly disagreed on that.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tThe State felt she was the type of juror - any type of mitigating evidence that would\r\nhave been presented, she would have latched on to and would have answered that last\r\nspecial issue to the point where the defendant would receive a life sentence instead\r\nof the death sentence.  And that's only if she became qualified.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tIt was the State's position, Judge - and I think the Court can even read the transcript\r\nwith the State and Defense presented after that day, that this juror specifically said,\r\n\"No, I do not think I could take that oath.\"  And then I pressed her on it.  She said,\r\n\"No, I could not take the oath to sit as a juror in a case like this.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tObviously, the Judge made his ruling and we abided by the ruling.  But then someone\r\nwho we felt couldn't even be comfortable taking the oath and potentially sentencing\r\nsomeone to die, the State was forced to use a peremptory strike on that particular\r\njuror.  It had nothing to do with the race of the juror or the sex of the juror, it just had\r\nto do with her answers throughout her questionnaire, as well as her answers to\r\nmyself, when I was questioning her.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tAnother point they brought up was with regards to the Karla Faye Tucker case.  She\r\nwould have given that person, who we all know, another chance and would have\r\npardoned her, she said on the record, as well.<sup> (24)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tSo based on a collective of all her answers in the questionnaire, as well as her\r\nanswers to myself, as well as the fact that we still feel that she couldn't even take the\r\noath to sit on a case like this, that is the reason that the State used a peremptory\r\nchallenge on Ms. McClendon, juror 1129.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>The defense made no attempt to rebut the State's race-neutral explanation and made no further\r\ncomment.  The court denied appellant's <em>Batson </em>challenge. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA comparison of McClendon's responses to those of persons acceptable to the State fails to\r\nrefute the State's race-neutral explanation.  Appellant urges that several jurors accepted by the State\r\nwanted to hear any and all mitigating evidence, and that others were concerned about the gravity of\r\nthe decision or might consider intoxication to be a mitigating circumstance.  None of the accepted\r\njurors expressed all of these feelings in concert, nor to the degree that McClendon did. Moreover,\r\nMcClendon was the only one to say that she would be unable to take the oath of a juror, which is the\r\ninitial reason that the State attempted to strike her for cause.  \t\t\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's ruling, we cannot\r\nconclude that the trial court's ruling on the peremptory strike of prospective juror McClendon was\r\nclearly erroneous.  Issue one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B. Challenges for Cause</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues two through sixteen, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying appellant's\r\nchallenges for cause against certain prospective jurors.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTo show harm when a challenge for cause is denied, appellant must demonstrate that, on the\r\nrecord, he: 1) asserted a clear and specific challenge for cause; 2) used a peremptory challenge on\r\nthe complained-of prospective juror; 3) exhausted all of his peremptory challenges; 4) requested\r\nadditional strikes and was denied;  and 5) identified an objectionable juror who served on the jury.<sup> (25)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn the present case, the record shows that appellant exhausted his peremptory challenges and\r\nreceived one additional peremptory challenge.  In order to show harm, appellant must demonstrate\r\nthat the trial court erroneously denied his challenge to two complained-of prospective jurors.<sup> (26)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review a trial court's ruling on a challenge for cause with considerable deference because\r\nthe trial court is in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror's demeanor and responses.<sup> (27)</sup> \r\nThis is particularly so when the challenged prospective juror vacillates or seems confused.<sup> (28)</sup>  When\r\nreviewing a trial court's decision on a challenge for cause, we look at the entire record of voir dire\r\nto determine if there is sufficient evidence to support the trial court's ruling.<sup> (29)</sup>  We will reverse a trial\r\ncourt's ruling on a challenge for cause only if an abuse of discretion is evident.<sup> (30)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA prospective juror may be challenged for cause for bias against any phase of the law upon\r\nwhich the State or the defendant is entitled to rely.<sup> (31)</sup>  Bias against the law is refusal to consider or\r\napply the relevant law.<sup> (32)</sup>  A prospective juror is biased when his beliefs or opinions would prevent\r\nor substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions\r\nand oath.<sup> (33)</sup>  However, before a prospective juror can be excused for cause on this basis, the law must\r\nbe explained to him and he must be asked whether he can follow that law regardless of his personal\r\nviews.<sup> (34)</sup>  The proponent of a challenge for cause does not meet his burden until he has shown that\r\nthe prospective juror understood the requirement of the law and could not overcome his prejudice\r\nwell enough to follow it.<sup> (35)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number two, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for\r\ncause against prospective juror Westlund.  At trial, appellant objected to Westlund because she\r\nwould shift the burden of proof on mitigation to the defense; thus, she would not be able to follow\r\nthe oath required of a juror.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tNo burden of proof exists for either appellant or the State on mitigation.<sup> (36)</sup>  Appellant bears\r\na burden of production on mitigation, however.<sup> (37)</sup>  It was not clear from Westlund's answers that she\r\nunderstood this distinction.  An examination of the record shows that this distinction was not\r\nexplained to her, nor was she asked if, understanding the law, she could set aside her personal views\r\nand follow the law.  Moreover, a prospective juror is not challengeable for cause \"simply because\r\nhe would place the burden of proof on mitigation on the defense.\"<sup> (38)</sup>  The record does not indicate\r\nany abuse of discretion in denying the challenge.  Issue number two is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues number three, four, and six through fifteen appellant claims that the trial court erred\r\nin denying his challenges for cause against prospective jurors Slaten, Arnett, Massey, Combs-Hollie,\r\nDent, Spurger,<sup> (39)</sup> Donihoo, Stanberry, Wetzel, Williams, Wallin<sup> (40)</sup> and Stanford.  Citing Justice\r\nScalia's dissent in <em>Morgan v. Illinois</em><sup> (41)</sup> for support, appellant objected that these prospective jurors\r\n\"[could] not give equal consideration to Mr. Robertson's mitigation, given the facts.\"  Because\r\nappellant expected to introduce certain types of evidence that these prospective jurors indicated that\r\nthey would not find mitigating, appellant argues that these prospective jurors were biased against\r\nhim, his evidence, and the law on which he would rely, and were incapable of taking the juror's oath. \r\nAppellant submitted a written objection and argument on these grounds, referred to as \"Trial\r\nObjection Number 1.\"  Later challenges based on this ground were sometimes simply communicated\r\nto the court as challenges based on \"trial objection one.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>   \tIn <em>Standefer v. State</em>, we held that \"a prospective juror is not challengeable for cause simply\r\nbecause he does not consider a particular type of evidence to be mitigating.\"<sup> (42)</sup>  \"[W]hether a\r\nprospective juror considers a particular type of evidence to be mitigating is not a proper area of\r\ninquiry.\"<sup> (43)</sup>  Also, a prospective juror is not required to give an example of something that he would\r\nconsider mitigating.<sup> (44)</sup>  Issues three, four, and six through fifteen are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number sixteen, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his challenge\r\nfor cause against prospective juror Jordan on the basis of trial objection number one. As explained\r\nabove, a juror is not required to find any particular evidence to be mitigating.  Appellant also argues\r\nin his brief that Jordan would automatically find appellant to be a future danger.  Appellant did not\r\nallege this reason as part of his challenge to the trial court.  To preserve error, a complaining party\r\nmust make a timely and specific request, objection or motion and obtain a ruling from the trial\r\ncourt.<sup> (45)</sup>  This claim was not preserved for appeal.<sup> (46)</sup>  Moreover, when the law was clarified to him,\r\nJordan stated that he would require the State to prove future dangerousness beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.  Issue number sixteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number nineteen, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying trial objection\r\nnumber one as to each member of the venire.  As explained above, this court has held that a\r\nprospective juror is not challengeable for cause simply because he does not consider a particular type\r\nof evidence to be mitigating, and whether a juror considers a particular type of evidence mitigating\r\nis not a proper area of inquiry.<sup> (47)</sup>   Issue number nineteen is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty-one, appellant argues that the trial court erred in overruling his\r\nobjection to the unconstitutionality of the jury selection process as a whole.   He asserts that because\r\nthe trial court denied his strikes for cause against jurors who \"[could] not consider Mr. Robertson's\r\nmitigation evidence,\" the jury was unconstitutionally formed, denying him due process and a fair\r\ntrial.   Appellant argues that state judges in Texas are not adequately trained in applying federal law\r\nin death-penalty cases, that the trial court did not correctly apply the law in this case, and that this\r\nled to an unconstitutional jury in appellant's case.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis amounts to a claim that, because the trial court overruled trial objection number one,\r\nthe jury was unconstitutionally formed.  <em>Morgan</em> provides that a juror who will automatically vote\r\nfor the death penalty may be removed for cause.<sup> (48)</sup>  It does not require a commitment to believe any\r\nparticular type of evidence to be  mitigating.<sup> (49)</sup>  As explained above, a prospective juror is not\r\nchallengeable for cause simply because he may or may not consider any particular type of evidence\r\nto be mitigating.<sup> (50)</sup>  Further, whether a juror considers a particular type of evidence to be mitigating\r\nis not a proper area of inquiry.<sup> (51)</sup>  Thus, a trial court does not err by refusing to allow a defendant to\r\nask prospective jurors questions based on facts peculiar to the case on trial.<sup> (52)</sup>  All that the law\r\nrequires is that a defendant be allowed to present relevant mitigating evidence and that the jury be\r\nprovided a vehicle to give effect to that evidence if the jury finds it to be mitigating.<sup> (53)</sup>  A review of\r\nthe record and the preceding issues demonstrates that the trial court did not err in its rulings.  Issue\r\ntwenty-one is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number five, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for\r\ncause against prospective juror Murphy.  Appellant objected that Murphy was biased against him and\r\nwould not consider his, nor any other, mitigating evidence.  In a conference out of Murphy's\r\npresence, the parties agreed that the court should further question him. Subsequently, the court\r\nrecalled Murphy and questioned him directly about his ability to be fair and impartial, and follow\r\nthe law.  The court asked: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWould you be predisposed to not consider any mitigating evidence?  Or can you keep\r\nan open mind?  Can you consider any evidence that might be presented by either side,\r\nunderstanding that neither side has the burden of proof?  Or something you've heard\r\nthrough the course of the trial that you thought was sufficient-mitigating\r\ncircumstance, [sic] to extend a life sentence to the defendant rather than the death\r\npenalty and answer the question 'yes' - and that's what the law would require you\r\nto do.  Can you do that?  If you can't, then you need to tell us you can't.  If you can,\r\nthen you need to tell us you can.  Only you know.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tMurphy responded that yes, he could consider the mitigation issue, and the challenge for\r\ncause was denied.  After examining the entire record, and in light of the appropriate deference to the\r\ntrial court's ruling, we do not find an abuse of discretion in denying this challenge.  Issue number\r\nfive is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues number seventeen and eighteen, appellant contends that the erroneous denial of his\r\nchallenges for cause detailed above deprived him of a lawfully constituted, unbiased, and\r\nunprejudiced group of jurors. He claims that this denied him a fair trial in violation of the United\r\nStates Constitution, the Texas Constitution and the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.   These\r\nobjections were not presented to the trial court; thus they are not preserved for review.  We further\r\nnote that none of the denied challenges for cause that appellant complains of were erroneous.  Issues\r\nseventeen and eighteen are overruled.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying \"trial objection\r\nnumber two\" as to each and every member of the venire.  Trial objection number two is a written\r\nobjection to \"improper exclusion of [a] juror with scruples against death\"<sup> (54)</sup> and appellant was\r\nallowed a running objection on this basis.  Appellant does not now argue that any jurors were\r\nimproperly excluded on this basis, nor does he argue that he was harmed.  Appellant's brief pairs the\r\nargument for this issue with the argument for issue nineteen, but it does not argue any issue\r\npresented in trial objection number two; thus this claim is inadequately briefed.<sup> (55)</sup>  Issue number\r\ntwenty is overruled.\t\t<strong>III.  TRIAL ISSUES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>A. False Testimony</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues twenty-two and twenty-three, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying\r\nhis motion for new trial, and for denying him a fair trial and due process in violation of the Fifth,\r\nSixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  He asserts that the\r\nState knowingly presented false and highly misleading testimony about appellant's future\r\ndangerousness.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tDue process is offended when the State knowingly or unknowingly offers material evidence\r\nthat is false or misleading .<sup> (56)</sup>  An examination of the evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that it\r\nwas neither false nor misleading - thus we need not address its materiality.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State called Warden Melodye Nelson as an expert witness about future dangerousness. \r\nWarden Nelson described how an inmate's living conditions are restricted through the use of a\r\nclassification system ranking inmates from G1 (least restrictive) through G5 (most restrictive) and\r\nadministrative segregation.  Appellant complains about the warden's statements concerning the\r\nfollowing: that appellant would automatically be classified as a G3 inmate; that prison personnel are \r\nunderpaid and short staffed, that one officer may look after 150 inmates, and that a year previously\r\nthe Texas Department of Criminal Justice was 4,000 officers short; that there is more violence in the\r\ngeneral population than in administrative segregation; that inmates can come and go from their cells\r\nto work; and that prison is filled with psychopaths.  At appellant's hearing on the motion for new\r\ntrial, appellant presented experts S.O. Woods and Dr. Mark Vigen, whose testimony was intended\r\nto counter the warden's testimony and show that her testimony was false or misleading.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough appellant did not object to this testimony contemporaneously, the trial court granted\r\na hearing on the motion.  Assuming, without deciding, that appellant's complaints were preserved,\r\nwe will address the issues.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>1.  Appellant would automatically be classified as a G3 inmate.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWarden Nelson testified at trial that if appellant were sentenced to life with parole (under the\r\nlaw in effect at the time of his conviction) he would be automatically classified as a G3 prisoner, a\r\nclassification including any offender sentenced to fifty years or more who had not served at least ten\r\nyears.  She further testified that after ten years a G3 inmate would be eligible for promotion to G2\r\nstatus.  Because appellant's disciplinary record during the eighteen years he spent on death row\r\ncontained only minor infractions, the warden stated that he would automatically be categorized as\r\na G2 if given a life sentence.  At the hearing on the motion for new trial, the State also presented an\r\naffidavit from Cay Cannon, a member of the State Classification Committee, opining that appellant\r\nwould be classified as a G2.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Woods stated that, \"As far as the G3 being an automatic, that's the rule of\r\nthumb for any sentence over fifty years, new inmate less than ten years of service time, those kinds\r\nof factors.\"  He disagreed with Warden Nelson's use of the word \"automatic,\" stating that it \"was\r\nnot a good choice of words.\" He explained that although TDCJ uses software that automatically\r\ndetermines an offender's status, TDCJ personnel may override this classification if there are reasons\r\nto do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAlthough Woods disagreed with the warden's choice of words, the evidence indicates that\r\nappellant was eligible for G2 status if given a life sentence.  Further, analysis of appellant's\r\ndisciplinary record by the experts showed no reason that the automatic classification produced by\r\nTDCJ software would have been overridden by TDCJ classification personnel.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>2.  Prison personnel are underpaid and short staffed, that an officer may look after 150 inmates,\r\nand that a year previously TDCJ was 4000 officers short.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWarden Nelson testified that TDCJ employees are underpaid, stating that an entry-level\r\ncorrectional officer received \"about the same as what a Wal-Mart warehouse worker [did].\"  She also\r\nindicated that there was rapid turnover, chronic under-staffing, and that \"one staff member may be\r\nin charge of up to 150 offenders.\"  She explained that because of this it was difficult to keep control\r\nover inmate access to contraband.  She also explained that although she did not know the current\r\nfigure, TDCJ was short 4,000 personnel the year before, and this shortage was not evenly distributed\r\nthroughout the system.  Rather, some units were very short-staffed, particularly in remote areas.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWoods testified that his investigation did not turn up anyone at TDCJ who agreed that one\r\nguard supervising 150 inmates was a typical situation.  He stated that using current TDCJ\r\nemployment figures and inmate figures, he calculated that there was approximately one guard for\r\nevery eight inmates and that the worst case was one guard for every eighteen inmates, but \"the fact\r\nis that TDC [sic] is such a complex operation and it consists of so many different variety of units that\r\nit's impossible to come up with anything like a ratio that says there's so many officers to so many\r\ninmates.\"  He stated that there were occasions where inmates would be under \"indirect supervision\"\r\nsuch as in chow halls or in a recreation yard \"where one or two or three officers might supervise\r\nlarge groups of inmates.\"   Woods acknowledged that he did not know about the 4,000 figure of two\r\nyears before, but that as of two weeks before, TDCJ was short 900 officers.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBecause the warden's testimony referred to a specific time period, and because there is no\r\nevidence of any inaccuracy in the warden's statement, there is no reason to believe that any juror was\r\nconfused or misled by her testimony about TDCJ staffing.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>3.  General population has more violence than administrative segregation.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWarden Nelson testified at trial that incidents of violence were more prevalent in general\r\npopulation than in administrative segregation or death row.   Woods testified at the hearing that\r\nalthough he cannot refute the warden's statements statistically, \"It's common sense\" that those\r\ninmates on administrative segregation are more dangerous.  Woods agreed, however, that simply\r\nbecause of the size of the general population, there is more opportunity for violence, concluding that\r\nthe warden's testimony did not give a false impression about the amount or nature of violence in\r\nprison.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts that Warden Nelson's testimony was misleading but does not suggest how\r\nit was so.  Although appellant's expert might have delivered the information differently, the\r\ntestimony itself did not give the jury a false impression.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>4.  Inmates can come and go from their cells to work.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the following exchange occurred between defense counsel and Warden Nelson:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   Now, when these people who were work-eligible in the G3s, who have some sort\r\nof a job somewhere in the system, they don't get up in the morning after the alarm\r\ngoes off, walk out of their cell, walk out into the hallway and go to wherever it is\r\nthey've got a job, do they?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   They do?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   And how -- how are they controlled at all then, if they can have that much\r\nfreedom?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Well, I'll give you a for instance.  Let's say they work in the laundry.  What\r\nwould happen is, the  laundry staff would call that particular housing area and tell\r\nthem to turn out all of the laundry workers.  The staff that's working that particular\r\nliving area has what we call a turn-out roster or roster.  They'll make a verbal call: \r\n\"All first-shift laundry workers, get up and go to work.\"  You know, get ready for\r\nwork.  They'll turn 'em out. Say, \"Okay.  We're going to open all your cell doors. \r\nAll you laundry workers be at the doors and you all step out.\"  They go and close all\r\nthe doors.  They check 'em off, and then they leave the building.  In some cases, staff\r\nwill call and say, \"Tell laundry, hey, I got 'em coming at you.\"  Or they would get\r\nbusy turning out kitchen workers and not tell the laundry they had ten coming, and\r\nthen they would just walk to the laundry.  And that's the process for all general\r\npopulation basic offenders who go to work.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t Q.   Well, that's what I'm saying:  There are people who are trying to keep up with\r\nthem.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\t A.   Uh-huh.  Yes.  We track them out the door.  Yeah.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   Right.  And they're  supposed to wind up where they're  supposed to wind up. \r\nOtherwise, you know that - or you should know about that, right?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   We wouldn't know it until a count time showed up and one of 'em wasn't where\r\nhe was  supposed to be.  Or they called and - you know, they got down there to the\r\nlaundry, laundry officer checks 'em all in and maybe an inmate that's on his tracking\r\nroster isn't there.  He calls that living area and says, \"Where is inmate Joe? Well, he\r\nturned out?\" And then it's a process of trying to figure out where he stopped in the\r\nprocess.  Did he go by the medical department?  Did he stop in the education\r\ndepartment?  So we would have a process of elimination, to try and find his physical\r\nwhereabouts.  And we do counts eight times in a 24-hour period. So somewhere in\r\nthat process, we would be able to find his whereabouts.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   That's what I'm saying:  You're keeping up with these people.  I mean, they're\r\nnot, willy-nilly, roaming around on their own, like you would when you were\r\nworking at a 7-Eleven out in the free world:  you get up and go inside the 7-Eleven.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   They're all inside the perimeter fence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tQ.   And you watch your count.  You worry about it, when they're missing, and then\r\nyou go find 'em.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>\tA.   Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWhen, at the hearing on the motion for new trial,  Woods was asked to describe how inmates\r\nmove from their cells to their assignments, he replied:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWell, prison in Texas is one of the most structured organizations you'll ever see. \r\nInmates are accounted for constantly.  They're physically counted at least once every\r\nshift.  Usually, a lot more than that. They all have assigned housing areas.  They have\r\nassigned jobs.  They have assigned schools.  Everything that they do is dictated to\r\nthem.  So, naturally, their turn-out list of all the housing areas that - say inmate Joe\r\nis going to go to this place.  There's going to be a person at the other end expecting\r\nhim.  When he doesn't show up, somebody's going to go looking for him.  So if you\r\ngo onto a unit and walk through a facility, yeah, there's lots of inmates moving up\r\nand down the halls, out in the yards and doing various things.  But they all have\r\ndestinations.  And that movement is controlled.  The hallways are single-file. \r\nThere's no grouping of inmates or stopping to talk and visit.  Those kind of things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis testimony is substantially identical to that presented by the warden at trial. Woods's\r\ntestimony does not establish that the warden's testimony was false or misleading.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><strong><em>5.  Prison is filled with psychopaths.</em></strong></span><span><em></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt trial, the prosecution attempted to introduce evidence about the frequency and type of\r\nviolence in TDCJ generally.  Defense counsel objected to the document's relevance, stating that \"the\r\nlaw requires individualized punishment\" and that \"[appellant] can't help it if there are a bunch of\r\npsychopaths in prison.\"  Defense counsel's objection was sustained, and examination of Warden\r\nNelson continued discussing opportunities for violence in the general population.  The prosecutor\r\nlater asked Nelson, \"I think defense characterized the prison as filled with psychopaths.  Do you\r\nremember that?\"  The  warden replied that she did.  The prosecutor asked if she agreed with that, and\r\nthe warden replied, \"Yes, sir.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt the hearing, Woods testified that there are probably more psychopaths in prison but that\r\nit would be inaccurate to say that every inmate is a psychopath.  This testimony contradicts neither\r\ndefense counsel's characterization of prison as being filled with psychopaths nor the warden's\r\nagreement.  Moreover, appellant opened the door to the question by making the comment. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant has not demonstrated that Warden Nelson's testimony was false or misleading. \r\nFurthermore, he has not shown that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for new\r\ntrial.  Issues twenty-two and twenty-three are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>B.  Confrontation</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue number twenty-seven, appellant asserts that the trial court erred by allowing the State\r\nto read testimony by witnesses from the original trial who are now deceased and unavailable for\r\ncross-examination.  Appellant claims that because the law of mitigation has developed since the\r\noriginal trial, defense counsel at the original trial did not understand what mitigation was.  Thus, he\r\nclaims, defense counsel could not have conducted effective cross-examination to develop mitigation\r\nevidence.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause states that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the\r\naccused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with witnesses against him.\"<sup> (57)</sup>  Generally, prior\r\ntestimony is admissible only if a witness is unavailable and if the defendant had the opportunity to\r\ncross-examine the witness.<sup> (58)</sup>  Texas Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1) permits the use of prior testimony\r\nin criminal cases if the defendant had a similar motive to develop testimony. Generally, \"when the\r\nparties, the charge, and the issues to be litigated are the same in the first and second trials, the two\r\nproceedings are necessarily the same and former testimony is admissible.\"<sup> (59)</sup>\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAt this re-trial, appellant objected to the admission of the prior testimony of Milton Gish and\r\nGene Lahourkade, both of whom testified at the 1991 capital murder trial.  Gish was unavailable\r\nbecause he was dead, and Lahourkade's mental and physical condition prevented him from\r\ntestifying.  Both witnesses were available for cross-examination at the initial trial.  The record from\r\nthat trial shows that defense counsel was well aware of the mitigation issue.  Contrary to appellant's\r\nclaim that mitigation \"didn't really exist much back when this case was tried,\" <em>Penry I<sup> (60)</sup></em></span><span> had\r\nrecognized the issue two years before the first trial, and appellant's original trial was replete with\r\nmitigation evidence.  Defense counsel at the original trial had a motive to present mitigation\r\nevidence similar to counsel at re-trial. Whether appellant would have conducted the same cross-examination now does not affect that motive.<sup> (61)</sup>  The trial court did not err in admitting the prior\r\ntestimony.  Issue twenty-seven is overruled.\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>C. Confessions</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues twenty-eight and twenty-nine, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting his oral and written confessions to police.  In appellant's 1991 trial, defense counsel\r\nmoved to suppress his statements to police; this motion was denied after a hearing.  In his present\r\ntrial, defense counsel re-urged the objections presented at the original trial, and the trial court\r\nresponded, \"[T]he evidence that came in is still in.  The objections originally made to that evidence\r\nare still valid objections and are preserved for appellate purposes.\"</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAssuming, without deciding, that this was a specific, timely objection, sufficient to preserve\r\nerror, if any, we will address his claim.  As we stated in our earlier opinion on direct appeal,<sup> (62)</sup>\r\nappellant's oral confession was admitted under Article 38.22, section 3(c) of the Texas Code of\r\nCriminal Procedure, which provides:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tSubsection (a) of this section shall not apply to any statement which contains\r\nassertions of facts or circumstances that are found to be true and which conduce to\r\nestablish the guilt of the accused, such as the finding of secreted or stolen property\r\nor the instrument with which he states the offense was committed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>We also stated that:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe only warnings which must precede an oral confession admitted under section\r\n3(c) are the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. In this instance, appellant informed Sergeant Medina\r\nof the crime, as well as the crime weapon and its location. Appellant confessed to the\r\nsergeant that he had used a .38 caliber pistol, that he had stolen the gun from a car\r\nparked at a club in Dallas, and that the gun was in a jewelry box on the floor board\r\nin the back seat of the stolen blue Cadillac. Pursuant to appellant's directions, the\r\nNevada police officers located the alleged murder weapon. That weapon was\r\nidentified by Texas forensic authorities as the murder weapon. Because the\r\nconfession contains assertions of facts which were found to be true and which help\r\nestablish appellant's guilt, the confession was admissible under article 38.22, section\r\n3(c) of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.<sup> (63)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tEvidence at the 1991 trial showed that appellant was properly warned as required by\r\n<em>Miranda</em>; thus, appellant's oral statements were admissible.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFurthermore, although appellant asserts that his written statement is inadmissible as well, an\r\nexamination of the record shows that the written statement met all the requirements of Article 38.22,\r\nsection 2 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure.  Issues twenty-eight and twenty-nine are\r\noverruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>D.  Extraneous Conduct Notice</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue thirty, appellant claims that the trial court erred by allowing Terry Barron to testify\r\nbecause she was not on the State's extraneous offense list.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe State called Terry Barron as a rebuttal witness after appellant's witness testified that he\r\nwas \"always a good kid and serious round them.\"  Appellant objected that Barron was not on the\r\nwitness list and that there was no notice of intent to introduce her testimony about an extraneous act. \r\nThe State explained that it brought Barron in to rebut appellant's mitigation witnesses, it had not\r\nplanned to put her on the stand until a few days before, and it had immediately notified defense\r\ncounsel about Barron and the substance of her testimony.  The trial court overruled the objection and\r\nallowed Barron to testify. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tTexas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 37.0711 provides that evidence may be presented\r\n\"as to any matter that the court deems relevant to sentence.\"<sup> (64)</sup>  Article 37.0711 is identical in this\r\nrespect to a previous iteration of Article 37.071 that we have held did not require notice of\r\nextraneous bad acts.<sup> (65)</sup>  Thus, under 37.0711 extraneous-conduct evidence is admissible at the\r\npunishment phase of a capital trial absent a showing of unfair surprise.<sup> (66)</sup>  Although appellant refers\r\nto Barron as a surprise witness, he does not show that he was unfairly surprised.  Furthermore, as we\r\nstated in <em>Jaubert</em>: </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t[W]hen the State presents extraneous offense evidence in rebuttal to mitigation\r\nevidence offered by the defendant, advance notice of intent to offer the extraneous\r\noffense evidence is not possible: In such a situation, the defendant, rather than the\r\nState, determines whether a contested issue will be raised, and his determination will\r\nnot be made known until he presents his case. It would be practically impossible for\r\nthe State to give notice until that time.<sup> (67)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tBarron's testimony was offered in rebuttal to mitigation evidence suggesting that appellant\r\nvalued human life.<sup> (68)</sup>  The State provided notice immediately upon deciding to use Barron's\r\ntestimony.  Issue thirty is overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>E.  Sidebar Comment</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue thirty-one, appellant claims that the trial court erred by not declaring a mistrial after\r\na sidebar comment by the prosecutor during Barron's testimony. While Barron testified about her\r\nbackground, appellant objected to the relevance of her testimony.  The State replied, \"Judge, I have\r\nno problem, we're going to get there.  But I think that the jury is allowed to know somebody who's\r\nlived through what she has lived through, has not killed three people.\"  Appellant objected to the\r\nState's sidebar comment, and the court sustained the objection.  Later on, appellant re-urged his\r\nobjection, and it was again sustained, whereupon he asked for a mistrial.  After an off-the-record\r\ndiscussion, the following exchange occurred:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourt: Okay.  Back on the record.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tState:  May I proceed, Judge?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourt: Just a moment.  There's been an objection by the defense.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant: Can I carry that for a moment and talk - decide how I want to do that?\t</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourt: All right.  Proceed.  In the meantime, we'll continue with testimony.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant: Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Barron's testimony continued, and she was eventually released.  After another witness was called\r\nand released, appellant told the court:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor the record, I want to clear up an objection, Your Honor, I made earlier in the\r\ntestimony of Terry Barron.  I had objected to the testimony of Ms. Barron's brother's\r\nhorrible childhood, as being sort of mitigating evidence.  And the prosecutor made\r\na comment that she did not kill anybody.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tI would ask the court to instruct the jury to disregard all the testimony and the\r\ncomment of the assistant district attorney, regarding her horrible background.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe court then instructed the jury to disregard the State's sidebar comment and denied\r\nappellant's subsequent request for a mistrial.<sup> (69)</sup></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe review a trial court's denial of a motion for mistrial under an abuse-of-discretion\r\nstandard.<sup> (70)</sup>   The purpose of an instruction to disregard is to cure any harm or prejudice resulting\r\nfrom events that have already occurred.<sup> (71)</sup>  Where the prejudice is curable, an instruction to disregard\r\neliminates the need for a mistrial.<sup> (72)</sup>  A mistrial is required only if \"the objectionable events are so\r\nemotionally inflammatory that curative instructions are not likely to prevent the jury from being\r\nunfairly prejudiced against the defendant.\"<sup> (73)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn this case, the alleged inflammatory event was the State's remark to the judge in a sidebar\r\nresponse to appellant's objections, not a statement intended for the jury.  Defense counsel\r\nimmediately objected to the State's comment, and the trial court ruled in appellant's favor.  Defense\r\ncounsel did not request a mistrial at this time.  It was not until appellant asked to clear up his\r\nobjection, after an intervening witness, that a mistrial was requested and an adverse ruling obtained. \r\nAssuming that this served as a timely objection, this sort of sidebar remark is curable through an\r\ninstruction to disregard.<sup> (74)</sup>  We find that the trial court's instruction to disregard sufficed to prevent\r\nthe jury from being unfairly prejudiced by the State's comment about Barron.  Issue thirty overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"CENTER\"><span><strong>IV.  DEATH-PENALTY ISSUES</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirty-two through forty-four, appellant presents several challenges to the\r\nconstitutionality of Texas death penalty law.  He acknowledges that these issues have been decided\r\nadversely to his position in the past and invites us to reconsider our holdings.  We decline to do so.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue thirty-six, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to preclude\r\nthe death penalty as a punishment option because state law does not provide a method for\r\ndetermining the death-worthiness of a defendant.  This claim has been addressed and rejected\r\npreviously.<sup> (75)</sup>  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirty-four, thirty-five and thirty-seven through forty-four, appellant presents issues\r\nidentical to those presented to this Court in <em>Saldano.</em> As we did in <em>Saldano</em>, we decline appellant's\r\ninvitation to review our prior decisions.<sup> (76)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Issues thirty-two through forty-four are overruled.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>DELIVERED: March 9, 2011</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>DO NOT PUBLISH</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.   <em>Robertson v.

The current version of Article 37.071 states in relevant part that the introduction of extraneous\r\nconduct evidence at the punishment phase of a capital case is governed by the notice requirements\r\nof Section 3(g), Article 37.07.  Under its plain language, Article 37.07 § 3(g) incorporates by\r\nreference Rule 404(b)'s manner of giving notice.  Rule 404(b) requires notice before extraneous\r\ncrimes or bad acts are admissible in the State's case-in-chief.  Thus, we explained in <em>Jaubert,</em> Article\r\n37.07's notice requirement applies to evidence of acts introduced during the State's case-in-chief. \r\nBy extension, since Article 37.071 incorporates the notice requirements of Article 37.07, which in\r\nturn incorporates the notice requirements Rule 404(b), Article 37.071's notice requirements apply\r\nonly to evidence of extraneous offenses or bad acts introduced during the State's case-in-chief on\r\npunishment.\r\n</p><p>69.   The trial court treated this as a timely, specific objection; therefore we will assume,\r\nwithout deciding, that it was.\r\n</p><p>70. <em>  Hawkins v.
