McCombs (wife), Robert M. McCombs\n\n(husband) moved the trial court to deny wife earnings which\n\naccrued on her undistributed share of husband's \"retirement\n\naccounts\" after the agreed valuation date.        The court determined\n\nthat the agreement allotted wife a settled share of the subject\n                                                                1\naccounts \"based on a valuation date of January 1, 1994,\"\ntogether with \"the dividends and any interest on [wife's] portion\n         *\n      Judge Overton participated in the hearing and decision of\nthis case prior to the effective date of his retirement on\nJanuary 31, 1999 and thereafter by his designation as a senior\njudge   pursuant   to   Code   § 17.1-401,   recodifying   Code\n§ 17-116.01:1.\n     **\n      Pursuant to Code § 17.1-413, recodifying Code § 17-116.010,\nthis opinion is not designated for publication.\n     1\n      Contrary to the recitation in the disputed order, the\nagreement provides, \"as valued on January 1, 1994.\"\n\f. . .

Smith, 3 Va.\n\nApp. at 514, 351 S.E.2d at 595.   The \"meaning and effect\" of an\n\nunambiguous agreement \"are questions of law to be determined by\n\nthe court,\" and \"we are not bound by [a] trial court's\n\nconstruction of . . . contract provisions . . . in issue.\"\nTiffany v. Tiffany, 1 Va. App. 11, 15, 332 S.E.2d 796, 799\n\n(1985).\n\n     Here, at the outset, we find no ambiguity in those\n\nprovisions of the agreement in issue.   The language expressly\n\n\n\n\n                                - 2 -\n\fprovides for the transfer of \"[f]ifty percent (50%) of husband's\n\nretirement accounts . . . as valued on January 1, 1994,\" to\n\nwife. 2   \"[S]egregat[ion] in a separate account . . . for wife\"\n\nwas to occur \"as soon as possible after entry of a final divorce\n\ndecree and . . . [Q.D.R.O.] prepared by wife's counsel.\"    Such\n\nlanguage clearly manifests the intent of the parties that wife\n\nlater receive one-half of the aggregate value of the subject\n\naccounts as determined on January 1, 1994, a date which preceded\n\nthe agreement by nearly two years, without mention of\n\nsubsequently accrued earnings.\n      The parties, therefore, did not contemplate the inclusion of\n\ndividends and interest on wife's share.    They simply agreed upon\n\nan uncomplicated formula which permitted each to\n\ncontemporaneously and precisely determine their respective\n\nbenefits and burdens relative to the accounts, thereby promoting\n\na mutually acceptable and expeditious resolution of differences.\n\n Accordingly, we reverse the disputed order and remand the\n\nproceedings to the trial court for further disposition consistent\n\n      2\n            Retirement Accounts: As an obligation which\n            shall not be dischargeable in bankruptcy,\n            Wife shall receive Fifty percent (50%) of\n            Husband's retirement accounts at Eastern\n            Virginia Medical School . . . as valued on\n            January 1, 1994 which shall be \"rolled over\"\n            or separated or segregated into a separate\n            account or accounts for Wife as soon as\n            possible after entry of a final divorce\n            decree and a Qualified Domestic Relations\n            Order (\"Q.R.D.O.\") prepared by Wife's counsel\n            and endorsed by Husband's counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fwith this opinion.\n\n                             Reversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                     - 4 -\n\f",
