We hold substantial evi-\ndence supports the Board’s findings and it did not err\nconcluding the mark comprises immoral or scandalous\nmatter. We conclude, however, that § 2(a)’s bar on regis-\ntering immoral or scandalous marks is an unconstitution-\nal restriction of free speech. We therefore reverse the\nBoard’s holding that Mr. Brunetti’s mark is unregistrable.\n                        BACKGROUND\n    I.   Section 2(a)’s Bar on Registration of Immoral or\n                       Scandalous Marks\n     Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act provides that the Pa-\ntent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) may refuse to register\na trademark that “[c]onsists of or comprises immoral,\ndeceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may\ndisparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons,\nliving or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or\nbring them into contempt or disrepute . . . .” 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1052(a). While § 2(a) identifies “immoral” and “scandal-\nous” subject matter as separate bases to refuse to register\na trademark—and are provisions separated by the “decep-\ntive” provision—the PTO generally applies the bar on\nimmoral or scandalous marks as a unitary provision (“the\nimmoral or scandalous provision”). See TMEP § 1203.01\n(“Although the words ‘immoral’ and ‘scandalous’ may have\nsomewhat different connotations, case law has included\nimmoral matter in the same category as scandalous\nmatter.”); In re McGinley, 660 F.2d 481, 485 n.6 (CCPA\n1981) (“Because of our holding, infra, that appellant’s\nmark is ‘scandalous,’ it is unnecessary to consider wheth-\ner appellant’s mark is ‘immoral.’ We note the dearth of\nreported trademark decisions in which the term ‘immoral’\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            3\n\n\n\nhas been directly applied.”); see also Anne Gilson LaLonde\n& Jerome Gilson, Trademarks Laid Bare: Marks That\nMay Be Scandalous or Immoral, 101 Trademark Rep.\n1476, 1489 (2011) (“U.S. courts and the Board have not\ndistinguished between ‘immoral’ and ‘scandalous’ and\nhave focused on whether marks are scandalous or offen-\nsive rather than contrary to some accepted standard of\nmorality.” (citation omitted)). The bar on immoral or\nscandalous marks was first codified in 1905, see Act of\nFeb. 20, 1905, ch. 592, § 5(a), 33 Stat. 724, 725, and re-\nenacted in the Lanham Act in 1946, Pub. L. 79-489, § 2(a),\n60 Stat. 427, 428 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a)).\n    To determine whether a mark should be disqualified\nunder § 2(a), the PTO asks whether a “substantial compo-\nsite of the general public” would find the mark scandal-\nous, defined as “shocking to the sense of truth, decency, or\npropriety; disgraceful; offensive; disreputable; . . . giving\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings; . . . or calling\nout for condemnation.” In re Fox, 702 F.3d 633, 635 (Fed.\nCir. 2012) (alterations omitted) (quoting In re Mavety\nMedia Grp. Ltd., 33 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).\nAlternatively, “the PTO may prove scandalousness by\nestablishing that a mark is ‘vulgar.’” Id. (quoting In re\nBoulevard Entm’t, Inc., 334 F.3d 1336, 1340 (Fed. Cir.\n2003)). Vulgar marks are “lacking in taste, indelicate,\n[and] morally crude . . . .” See McGinley, 660 F.2d at 486\n(quoting In re Runsdorf, 171 U.S.P.Q. 443, 443–44\n(1971)). The PTO makes a determination as to whether a\nmark is scandalous “in the context of contemporary atti-\ntudes” and “in the context of the marketplace as applied\nto only the goods described in the application.” Fox,\n702 F.3d at 635 (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted) (quoting Mavety, 33 F.3d at 1371).\n    Because the scandalousness determination is made in\nthe context of contemporary attitudes, the concept of what\nis actually immoral or scandalous changes over time.\nEarly cases often, but not always, focused on religious\n\f4                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nwords or symbols. See, e.g., In re Riverbank Canning Co.,\n95 F.2d 327, 329 (CCPA 1938) (MADONNA for wine); Ex\nparte Martha Maid Mfg. Co., 37 U.S.P.Q. 156 (Comm’r\nPat. 1938) (QUEEN MARY for women’s underwear); Ex\nParte Summit Brass & Bronze Works, Inc., 59 U.S.P.Q. 22\n(Comm’r Pat. 1943) (AGNUS DEI for safes); In re P. J.\nValckenberg, Gmbh, 122 U.S.P.Q. 334 (T.T.A.B. 1959)\n(MADONNA for wine); In re Reemtsma Cigarettenfab-\nriken G.M.B.H., 122 U.S.P.Q. 339 (T.T.A.B. 1959)\n(SENUSSI (a Muslim sect that forbids smoking) for\ncigarettes); In re Sociedade Agricola E. Comerical Dos\nVinhos Messias, S.A.R.L., 159 U.S.P.Q. 275 (T.T.A.B.\n1968) (MESSIAS for wine and brandy). In later cases, the\nPTO rejected a wider variety of marks as scandalous. See,\ne.g., Runsdorf, 171 U.S.P.Q. at 443 (BUBBY TRAP for\nbrassieres); McGinley, 660 F.2d at 482 (mark consisting of\n“a photograph of a nude man and woman kissing and\nembracing in a manner appearing to expose the male\ngenitalia” for a swingers newsletter); In re Tinseltown,\nInc., 212 U.S.P.Q. 863 (T.T.A.B. 1981) (BULLSHIT on\nhandbags, purses, and other personal accessories); Grey-\nhound Corp. v. Both Worlds, Inc., 6 U.S.P.Q.2d 1635\n(T.T.A.B. 1988) (mark depicting a defecating dog); Mavety,\n33 F.3d 1367 (BLACK TAIL for adult entertainment\nmagazines).\n                  II. Facts of This Case\n    Mr. Brunetti owns the clothing brand “fuct,” which he\nfounded in 1990. In 2011, two individuals filed an intent-\nto-use application (No. 85/310,960) for the mark FUCT for\nvarious items of apparel. The original applicants as-\nsigned the application to Mr. Brunetti, who amended it to\nallege use of the mark. The examining attorney refused\nto register the mark under § 2(a) of the Lanham Act,\nfinding it comprised immoral or scandalous matter. The\nexamining attorney reasoned that FUCT is the past tense\nof the verb “fuck,” a vulgar word, and is therefore scan-\ndalous. J.A. 203.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          5\n\n\n\n    Mr. Brunetti requested reconsideration and appealed\nto the Board. The examining attorney denied reconsider-\nation, and the Board affirmed. In its decision, the Board\nstated the dictionary definitions in the record uniformly\ncharacterize the word “fuck” as offensive, profane, or\nvulgar. The Board noted that the word “fuct” is defined\nby Urban Dictionary as the past tense of the verb “fuck”\nand pronounced the same as the word “fucked,” and\ntherefore found it is “recognized as a slang and literal\nequivalent of the word ‘fucked,’” with “the same vulgar\nmeaning.” J.A. 6–7 & n.6. Based on the examining\nattorney’s Google Images search results, the Board stated\nMr. Brunetti used the mark in the context of “strong, and\noften explicit, sexual imagery that objectifies women and\noffers degrading examples of extreme misogyny,” with a\ntheme “of extreme nihilism—displaying an unending\nsuccession of anti-social imagery of executions, despair,\nviolent and bloody scenes including dismemberment,\nhellacious or apocalyptic events, and dozens of examples\nof other imagery lacking in taste.” J.A. 8–9. The Board\nexplained that Mr. Brunetti’s use of the mark “will be\nperceived by his targeted market segment as the phonetic\nequivalent of the wor[d] ‘fucked.’” J.A. 9. In light of the\nrecord, it found Mr. Brunetti’s assertion that the mark\n“was chosen as an invented or coined term stretches\ncredulity.” Id. It concluded that the mark is vulgar and\ntherefore unregistrable under § 2(a) of the Lanham Act.\nMr. Brunetti appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1295(a)(4).\n                       DISCUSSION\n    Mr. Brunetti argues substantial evidence does not\nsupport the Board’s finding the mark FUCT is vulgar\nunder § 2(a) of the Lanham Act. He argues even if the\nmark is vulgar, § 2(a) does not expressly prohibit the\nregistration of vulgar marks and a mark should be ap-\nproved for registration when there is doubt as to its\nmeaning, as he alleges there is here. Alternatively,\n\f6                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nMr. Brunetti challenges the constitutionality of § 2(a)’s\nbar on immoral or scandalous marks.\n    I. The Mark FUCT is Vulgar and Therefore Scandalous\n    The determination that a mark is scandalous is a con-\nclusion of law based upon underlying factual inquiries.\nFox, 702 F.3d at 637. We review the Board’s factual\nfindings for substantial evidence and its ultimate conclu-\nsion de novo. Id. Substantial evidence is “more than a\nmere scintilla” and “such relevant evidence as a reasona-\nble mind might accept as adequate” to support a conclu-\nsion. Consol. Edison v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938).\n    It is undisputed that the word “fuck” is vulgar. Dic-\ntionaries in the record characterize the word as “taboo,”\n“one of the most offensive” English words, “almost univer-\nsally considered vulgar,” and an “extremely offensive\nexpression.” J.A. 5–6; J.A. 206 (Collins Online Diction-\nary); J.A. 209 (Vocabulary.com); J.A. 211 (Wikipedia.com);\nJ.A. 351 (MacMillan Dictionary). Mr. Brunetti argues\nthat the vulgarity of “fuck” is irrelevant to whether the\nmark FUCT is vulgar. We do not agree.\n    Substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding\nthat “fuct” is a “phonetic twin” of “fucked,” the past tense\nof the word “fuck.” J.A. 10. Urban Dictionary defines\n“fuct” as the “past tense of the verb fuck.” J.A. 83. Mac-\nMillan Dictionary indicates that the word “fucked” is\npronounced phonetically as /fʌkt/, which the Board found\nsounds like “fukt” or “fuct.” J.A. 6 & n.6. This evidence\nlinking the two terms is sufficient to render the vulgarity\nof the word “fuck” relevant to the vulgarity of\nMr. Brunetti’s mark.\n    Evidence of the use of Mr. Brunetti’s mark in the\nmarketplace further buttresses the Board’s finding of a\nlink between the mark and the word “fuck.” The Board\nfound the term “fuct” is used on products containing\nsexual imagery and that consumers perceive the mark as\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           7\n\n\n\nhaving “an unmistakable aura of negative sexual connota-\ntions.” J.A. 9. One T-shirt—captioned the “FUCT Orgy”\nshirt—depicts a group sex scene. J.A. 346. Another T-\nshirt contains the word “FUCK” in yellow letters, with a\n“T” superimposed over the “K” such that the word FUCK\nis still visible. J.A. 325. A third T-shirt has the brand\nname FUCT depicted above the slogan “1970 smokin dope\n& fucking in the streets.” J.A. 312. Because one meaning\nof “fuck” is “to have sex with someone,” the placement of\nthe mark on products containing sexual imagery makes it\nmore likely that the mark will be perceived as the phonet-\nic equivalent of the word “fucked.” J.A. 9.\n    Mr. Brunetti challenges the evidence on which the\nBoard relied in making the vulgarity finding. He argues\nthat Urban Dictionary is not a standard dictionary edited\nby lexicographers and the author of the definition cited by\nthe Board lacks lexicographic expertise. He argues that\nthe Board did not consider his current line of products,\nwhich he provided to the examining attorney, but instead\nrelied on a random collection of outdated products collect-\ned from Google Images. He argues the Board should not\nhave considered these images because they lack founda-\ntion, are inadmissible hearsay, and are irrelevant to the\ncurrent perception of the mark in the marketplace. He\nalso argues that the majority of the marked products\ncontain no sexual imagery.\n    Mr. Brunetti’s arguments have no merit. For ex parte\nproceedings, the Board permits the examining attorney to\nconsider materials from the Internet, having adopted a\n“somewhat more permissive stance with respect to the\nadmissibility and probative value of evidence.” TBMP\n§§ 1208, 1208.03. The pedigree of the author of a defini-\ntion may affect the weight that evidence is given but does\nnot render the definition irrelevant. Similarly, the ages of\nthe images collected by the examining attorney may affect\nevidentiary weight, not relevance.\n\f8                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n    Mr. Brunetti also argues that the Board ignored pro-\nbative evidence that the mark is not vulgar. He argues\nthat both he and the owner of a high-end clothing store\ndeclared that the mark was not vulgar. He argues that\nthe meaning of the term “fuct” is ambiguous, but that to\nthe extent it has any meaning, it is “Friends yoU Can’t\nTrust.” See Mavety, 33 F.3d at 1374 (“commend[ing] the\npractice” of erring on the side of publication when marks\nare not clearly scandalous). He claims that in over twenty\nyears of operation, he received only a single complaint\nabout his brand name and the brand is mass-distributed\nby “high-end national retailers” like Urban Outfitters.\nAppellant’s Br. 8. Finally, he argues that two of Urban\nDictionary’s seven definitions of the term “fuct” refer to\nhis brand name, while only one definition is vulgar.\n    Mr. Brunetti’s proffered evidence does not change our\nconclusion that substantial evidence supports the Board’s\nfindings. The Board explicitly considered Mr. Brunetti’s\ndeclaration and found it “stretche[d] credulity” that “fuct”\nwas chosen as an invented or coined term for “Friends\nyoU Can’t Trust,” given the contradictory record evidence.\nJ.A. 9–10. Mr. Brunetti’s unverifiable claim about the\nnumber of customer complaints may demonstrate that the\nmark is not offensive to a certain segment of the market.\nThat does not satisfy his burden on appeal, however, to\nestablish that the Board lacked substantial evidence for\nits determination that a “substantial composite” of the\nAmerican public would find the mark vulgar. And the\nfact that the Board could have relied on one of the other\nfive definitions of the term “fuct” on Urban Dictionary—a\nwebsite to which anyone can anonymously submit defini-\ntions—does not demonstrate that the Board’s reliance on\nthat website is not substantial evidence. The Board\nreasonably focused on the highest rated definition, sug-\ngesting that it is more common or accurate than the\nalternative, non-vulgar definitions.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            9\n\n\n\n    Mr. Brunetti argues that even if FUCT is vulgar,\n§ 2(a) does not prohibit the registration of vulgar marks—\nonly “immoral” or “scandalous” marks. He argues that to\nbe immoral or scandalous, a mark must be more than\nmerely vulgar. He argues that extending § 2(a) to vulgar\nmarks is contrary to the plain language of the statute.\n    We do not agree. We have previously held “the PTO\nmay prove scandalousness by establishing that a mark is\n‘vulgar.’” Fox, 702 F.3d at 635; see also Boulevard Entm’t,\n334 F.3d at 1340 (“A showing that a mark is vulgar is\nsufficient to establish that it ‘consists of or comprises\nimmoral . . . or scandalous matter’ within the meaning of\nsection 1052(a).”). We are bound by these holdings.\n     Even if we could overrule our prior holding that a\nshowing of vulgarity is sufficient to establish that a mark\n“consists of or comprises immoral . . . or scandalous mat-\nter,” we see no justification for doing so in light of the\nevidence of record. At the time of the passage of the\nLanham Act, dictionaries defined “scandalous” as “shock-\ning to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety,” “[g]iving\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings,” or “calling out\n[for] condemnation.” McGinley, 660 F.2d at 485–86 (citing\nWebster’s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1942);\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary (1945)).\nOther definitions characterize scandalous as “disgraceful,”\n“offensive,” or “disreputable.” Id. (citing Webster’s New\nInternational Dictionary (2d ed. 1942); Funk & Wagnalls\nNew Standard Dictionary (1945)). We see no definition of\nscandalous that, in light of the PTO’s fact findings, would\nexempt Mr. Brunetti’s mark.\n    We see no merit in Mr. Brunetti’s arguments relating\nto whether the mark is scandalous and therefore prohibit-\ned registration under § 2(a). Substantial evidence sup-\nports the Board’s finding the mark FUCT is vulgar and\ntherefore the Board did not err in concluding the mark is\nnot registrable under § 2(a).\n\f10                                         IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nII. Section 2(a)’s Bar on Immoral or Scandalous Marks is\n      Unconstitutional Under the First Amendment\n    When Mr. Brunetti filed his appeal, his constitutional\nargument was foreclosed by binding precedent.           In\nMcGinley, our predecessor court held the refusal to regis-\nter a mark under § 2(a) does not bar the applicant from\nusing the mark, and therefore does not implicate the First\nAmendment. 660 F.2d at 484. Commentators heavily\ncriticized McGinley and our continued reliance on it,\nparticularly in light of the many changes to First\nAmendment jurisprudence over the last thirty years. In\nre Tam, 808 F.3d 1321, 1333–34 & n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en\nbanc). We reconsidered McGinley en banc in Tam, which\nheld the disparagement provision of § 2(a) unconstitu-\ntional under the First Amendment because it discriminat-\ned on the basis of content, message, and viewpoint. Id.\nat 1334–37, 1358. We held that, although trademarks\nserve a commercial purpose as source identifiers in the\nmarketplace, the disparagement provision of § 2(a) relat-\ned to the expressive character of marks, not their com-\nmercial purpose. Id. at 1337–39. As either a content-\nbased or viewpoint-based regulation of expressive speech,\nthe disparagement provision was subject to strict scruti-\nny. Id. at 1339. It was undisputed that the measure did\nnot survive such scrutiny. Id.\n    We rejected the government’s arguments that § 2(a)\ndid not implicate the First Amendment, holding instead\nthat the PTO’s denial of marks had a chilling effect on\nspeech. Id. at 1339–45. We also rejected the govern-\nment’s arguments that trademark registration was gov-\nernment speech, id. at 1345–48, and that trademark\nregistration was a federal subsidy, id. at 1348–55. Final-\nly, we held the disparagement provision did not survive\neven the lesser scrutiny afforded to commercial speech\nunder Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public\nService Commission, 447 U.S. 557, 563 (1980), because\nthe government had put forth no substantial interests\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           11\n\n\n\njustifying the regulation of speech.       Tam, 808 F.3d\nat 1355–58.\n    The en banc court noted that § 2(a) contains a hodge-\npodge of differing prohibitions on registration, and as\nsuch, the holding in Tam was limited to § 2(a)’s dispar-\nagement provision. Id. at 1330; see also id. at 1330 n.1.\nHowever, the court left open whether other portions of § 2\nmay also be unconstitutional, and held that McGinley was\noverruled insofar as it could prevent a future panel from\nreconsidering the constitutionality of other portions of § 2.\nId. at 1330 n.1.\n    Following the issuance of our en banc decision in Tam,\nwe requested additional briefing from both parties in this\ncase on “the impact of the Tam decision on Mr. Brunetti’s\ncase, and in particular whether there is any basis for\ntreating immoral and scandalous marks differently than\ndisparaging marks.” In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket\nNo. 51 (Fed. Cir. Dec. 22, 2015). Both parties filed letter\nbriefs. The government stated that “given the breadth of\nthe Court’s Tam decision and in view of the totality of the\nCourt’s reasoning,” there is no reasonable basis for treat-\ning immoral or scandalous marks differently than dispar-\naging marks. Gov’t Letter Br. 2, In re Brunetti, No. 15-\n1109, Docket No. 52 (Fed. Cir. Jan. 21, 2016). It main-\ntained, however, that if the Solicitor General sought\nSupreme Court review of our en banc decision in Tam,\n“the government may argue that, under reasoning less\nsweeping than that adopted in Tam, the bar on registra-\ntion of scandalous and immoral marks would survive even\nif the bar on registration of disparaging marks were held\ninvalid.” Id. at 4. The Supreme Court subsequently\ngranted certiorari. Lee v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 30 (2016).\n    On June 19, 2017, the Supreme Court unanimously\naffirmed our en banc decision in Tam. Matal v. Tam,\n137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017). The Court held that trademarks\nare private, not government, speech. Id. at 1757–61.\n\f12                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to two opinions authored by Justice Alito and\nJustice Kennedy, it concluded that § 2(a)’s bar on the\nregistration of disparaging marks discriminated based on\nviewpoint. Id. at 1763 (Alito, J.); id. at 1765 (Kennedy,\nJ.). The Court explained the disparagement provision\n“offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech\nmay not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas\nthat offend.” Id. at 1751 (Alito, J.); accord id. at 1766\n(Kennedy, J.). The plurality opinion, authored by Justice\nAlito and joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas,\nand Justice Breyer, further concluded that the constitu-\ntionality of the disparagement provision could not be\nsustained by analyzing trademark registration as either a\nfederal subsidy or a federal program. Id. at 1760–63\n(Alito, J.). The remaining four participating Justices\nopined, in a concurring opinion authored by Justice Ken-\nnedy, that “the viewpoint discrimination rationale renders\nunnecessary any extended treatment of other questions\nraised by the parties.” Id. at 1765 (Kennedy, J.).\n   Both opinions held the disparagement provision un-\nconstitutionally restricted free speech, left open was “the\nquestion of whether Central Hudson provides the appro-\npriate test for deciding free speech challenges to provi-\nsions of the Lanham Act.” Id. at 1764 n.17 (Alito, J.); see\nalso id. at 1767 (Kennedy, J.). Justice Alito’s opinion\nconcluded the disparagement provision failed even the\nintermediate test under Central Hudson because the\nprohibition was not narrowly drawn to a substantial\ngovernment interest. Id. at 1764–65 (Alito, J.). Justice\nKennedy’s opinion concluded that, because the dispar-\nagement provision discriminates based on viewpoint, it\nwas subject to heightened scrutiny, which it did not\nwithstand. Id. at 1767–68 (Kennedy, J.). Neither opinion\nreached the constitutionality of other provisions of § 2 of\nthe Lanham Act. See, e.g., id. at 1768 (Kennedy, J.).\n   Following the issuance of the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Tam, we requested additional briefing from the parties\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          13\n\n\n\nregarding the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision on\nMr. Brunetti’s case. In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket\nNo. 58 (Fed. Cir. June 20, 2017). Both parties submitted\nletter briefs and we heard oral argument on August 29,\n2017. The government contends Tam does not resolve the\nconstitutionality of § 2(a)’s bar on registering immoral or\nscandalous marks because the disparagement provision\nimplicates viewpoint discrimination, whereas the immoral\nor scandalous provision is viewpoint neutral. Gov’t Letter\nBr. 6–9, In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket No. 60 (Fed.\nCir. July 20, 2017).\n    While we question the viewpoint neutrality of the\nimmoral or scandalous provision, we need not resolve that\nissue. Independent of whether the immoral or scandalous\nprovision is viewpoint discriminatory, we conclude the\nprovision impermissibly discriminates based on content in\nviolation of the First Amendment.\n    A. Section 2(a)’s Bar on Registering Immoral or\nScandalous Marks is an Unconstitutional Content-Based\n                 Restriction on Speech\n    The government restricts speech based on content\nwhen “a law applies to particular speech because of the\ntopic discussed or the idea or message expressed.” Reed v.\nTown of Gilbert, 135 S. Ct. 2218, 2227 (2015). Content-\nbased statutes are presumptively invalid. RAV v. City of\nSt. Paul, Minn., 505 U.S. 377, 382 (1992). To survive,\nsuch statutes must withstand strict scrutiny review,\nwhich requires the government to “prove that the re-\nstriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly\ntailored to achieve that interest.” Reed, 135 S. Ct. at 2231\n(quoting Ariz. Free Enter. Club’s Freedom Club PAC v.\nBennett, 564 U.S. 721, 734 (2011)); United States v. Play-\nboy Entm’t Grp., Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000) (“If a\nstatute regulates speech based on its content, it must be\nnarrowly tailored to promote a compelling Government\ninterest. If a less restrictive alternative would serve the\n\f14                                            IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nGovernment’s purpose, the legislature must use that\nalternative.”). Strict scrutiny applies whether a govern-\nment statute bans or merely burdens protected speech.\nSee Playboy, 529 U.S. at 812 (“The Government’s content-\nbased burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as\nits content-based bans.”).\n    The government concedes that § 2(a)’s bar on register-\ning immoral or scandalous marks is a content-based\nrestriction on speech. Oral Arg. at 11:57–12:05. And the\ngovernment does not assert that the immoral or scandal-\nous provision survives strict scrutiny review. Instead, the\ngovernment contends § 2(a)’s content-based bar on regis-\ntering immoral or scandalous marks does not implicate\nthe First Amendment because trademark registration is\neither a government subsidy program or limited public\nforum. Gov’t Letter Br. 14, In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109,\nDocket No. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017); Oral Arg.\nat 12:06–21, 18:15–39. Alternatively, the government\nargues trademarks are commercial speech implicating\nonly the intermediate level of scrutiny set forth in Central\nHudson. Gov’t Letter Br. 15, In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109,\nDocket No. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017); Oral Arg.\nat 35:05–17. Under a less exacting degree of scrutiny, the\ngovernment argues the immoral or scandalous provision\nis an appropriate content-based restriction tailored to\nsubstantial government interests. We consider these\narguments in turn.\n1. Trademark Registration is Not a Government Subsidy\n                       Program\n    The Spending Clause of the U.S. Constitution “pro-\nvides Congress broad discretion to tax and spend for the\n‘general Welfare,’ including by funding particular state or\nprivate programs or activities.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v.\nAll. for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 133 S. Ct. 2321, 2327–28\n(2013); U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Within this discretion\nis the authority to attach certain conditions to the use of\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           15\n\n\n\nits funds “to ensure they are used in the manner Congress\nintends.” Id. at 2328; see also Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S.\n173, 198 (1991) (“The condition that federal funds will be\nused only to further the purposes of a grant does not\nviolate constitutional rights.”).      Other government-\nimposed conditions may impermissibly impinge the First\nAmendment rights of fund recipients. Pursuant to the\nlong-established unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the\ngovernment may not restrict a recipient’s speech simply\nbecause the government provides him a benefit:\n   [E]ven though a person has no “right” to a valua-\n   ble governmental benefit and even though the\n   government may deny him the benefit for any\n   number of reasons, there are some reasons upon\n   which the government may not rely. It may not\n   deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes\n   his    constitutionally      protected    interests—\n   especially, his interest in freedom of speech.\nPerry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972); accord Bd.\nof Cty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996)\n(“[T]he threat of the loss of [a valuable financial benefit]\nin retaliation for speech may chill speech on matters of\npublic concern . . . .”). Conditions attached to government\nprograms may unconstitutionally restrict First Amend-\nment rights even if the program involves Congress’ au-\nthority to direct spending under the Spending Clause.\nSee, e.g., Agency for Int’l Dev., 133 S. Ct. at 2330–31\n(holding Congress could not restrict appropriations aimed\nat combating the spread of HIV/AIDS to only organiza-\ntions that affirmatively opposed prostitution and sex\ntrafficking); FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S.\n364, 399–400 (1984) (rejecting the government’s argument\nthat Congress’ spending power justified conditioning\nfunding to public broadcasters on their refraining from\neditorializing). The constitutional line, while “hardly\nclear,” rests between “conditions that define the limits of\nthe government spending program—those that specify the\n\f16                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nactivities Congress wants to subsidize—and conditions\nthat seek to leverage funding to regulate speech outside\nthe contours of the program itself.” Agency for Int’l Dev.,\n133 S. Ct. at 2328.\n    The government argues, pursuant to the government\nsubsidy framework articulated in Agency for International\nDevelopment, that § 2(a)’s bar on registering immoral or\nscandalous marks is simply a reasonable exercise of its\nspending power, in which the bar on registration is a\nconstitutional condition defining the limits of trademark\nregistration. Our court rejected the applicability of this\nanalysis to trademark registration, 9–3, in our en banc\ndecision in Tam. 1 808 F.3d at 1348–55. The four Justices\nwho reached the issue in Tam likewise held the govern-\nment subsidy framework does not apply to trademark\nregistration. 137 S. Ct. at 1761 (Alito, J.). Justice Alito\nexplained in his plurality opinion that while the constitu-\ntional framework articulated in Agency for International\nDevelopment “‘is not always self-evident,’ no difficult\nquestion is presented here.” Id. (quoting 133 S. Ct.\nat 2330 (alterations omitted)).\n\n\n\n     1  The government maintains that our en banc deci-\nsion in Tam is not binding on this panel in light of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in Tam. Oral Arg. at 12:23–\n13:36, 15:43–54. We question the force of this assertion\nbecause the Supreme Court did not reverse or otherwise\ncast doubt on the continuing validity of our government\nsubsidy analysis and other aspects of our decision in Tam.\nSee Chen v. Allstate Ins. Co., 819 F.3d 1136, 1138 n.1 (9th\nCir. 2016); Balintulo v. Ford Motor Co., 796 F.3d 160, 166\nn.28 (2d Cir. 2015). Because we independently reach the\nsame conclusion as the en banc court, we need not decide\nwhether that holding continues to bind future panel\ndecisions in this circuit.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                         17\n\n\n\n    Unlike trademark registration, the programs at issue\nin the Supreme Court’s cases upholding the constitution-\nality of conditions under the Spending Clause necessarily\nand directly implicate Congress’ power to spend or control\ngovernment property. For example, Rust addressed a\ncondition on the distribution of federal funds for family\nplanning services. 500 U.S. at 177. The Supreme Court’s\nplurality opinion in United States v. American Library\nAssociation, Inc. upheld a condition on federal funding for\nInternet access to public libraries. 539 U.S. 194, 212\n(2003). While Regan v. Taxation with Representation of\nWashington concerned tax exemptions and deductions,\nthe Supreme Court specified, “[b]oth tax exemptions and\ntax-deductibility are a form of subsidy that is adminis-\ntered through the tax system.” 461 U.S. 540, 544 (1983).\n“The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like\nthe programs at issue in these cases.” Tam, 137 S. Ct.\nat 1761 (Alito, J.).\n    Trademark registration does not implicate Congress’\npower to spend funds. An applicant does not receive\nfederal funds upon the PTO’s consideration of, or grant of,\na trademark. The only exchange of funds flows from the\napplicant to the PTO. The applicant pays the applicable\ntrademark process and service fees set forth in 37 C.F.R.\n§ 2.6(a)(1), which are then made “available to the Director\nto carry out the activities of the [PTO].” 35 U.S.C.\n§ 42(c)(1). As explained in our en banc opinion in Tam,\nsince 1991, trademark registration fees—not appropria-\ntions from taxpayers—have entirely funded the direct\noperating expenses associated with trademark registra-\ntion. 808 F.3d at 1353 (citing, e.g., Figueroa v. United\nStates, 466 F.3d 1023, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Congress’\nauthority to direct funds is thus not implicated by either\nthe operating expenses necessary to examine a proposed\nmark or the PTO’s ultimate grant of trademark registra-\ntion. Of course, trademark registration does not persist\nentirely independent of federal funds. The government\n\f18                                            IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nmust expend certain federal funds, including but not\nlimited to the cost of PTO employee benefits and costs\nassociated with trademark enforcement, in connection\nwith trademark registration. See id. (citing Figueroa, 466\nF.3d at 1028). But to the extent government resources\nare tangentially involved with trademark registration,\n“just about every government service requires the ex-\npenditure of government funds.” Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1761\n(listing, for example, police and fire protection, and copy-\nright and motor vehicle registrations) (Alito, J.); Tam,\n808 F.3d at 1353 (“Trademark registration does not\nimplicate the Spending Clause merely because of this\nattenuated spending, else every benefit or regulatory\nprogram provided by the government would implicate the\nSpending Clause.”). The government’s involvement in\nprocessing and issuing trademarks does not transform\ntrademark registration into a government subsidy.\n   Nor is the grant of trademark registration a subsidy\nequivalent. “Registration is significant. The Lanham Act\nconfers important legal rights and benefits on trademark\nowners who register their marks.” B&B Hardware, Inc. v.\nHargis Indus., Inc., 135 S. Ct. 1293, 1300 (2015) (quota-\ntion marks omitted). These benefits are numerous and\ninclude the “right to exclusive nationwide use of that\nmark where there was no prior use by others,” Tam, 808\nF.3d at 1328, a presumption of validity, 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1057(b), incontestability in certain situations, id. § 1065,\nthe right to sue in federal court, id. § 1121, the right to\nrecover treble damages for willful infringement, id.\n§ 1117, a complete defense to state or common law claims\nof trademark dilution, id. § 1125(c)(6), the assistance of\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection in restricting impor-\ntation of infringing or counterfeit goods, id. § 1124;\n19 U.S.C. § 1526, the right to prevent “cybersquatters”\nfrom misappropriating a domain name, 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1125(d), and qualification for a simplified process for\nobtaining recognition and protection of a mark in coun-\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                         19\n\n\n\ntries that have signed the Paris Convention, see id.\n§ 1141b (Madrid Protocol); Paris Convention for the\nProtection of Industrial Property art. 6quinquies, July 14,\n1967, 21 U.S.T. 1583, 828 U.N.T.S. 305. While these\nbenefits are valuable, they are not analogous to Congress’\ngrant of federal funds. The benefits of trademark regis-\ntration arise from the statutory framework of the Lanham\nAct, and the Lanham Act in turn derives from the Com-\nmerce Clause.\n   Our sister courts confirm that when government regis-\ntration does not implicate Congress’ authority under the\nSpending Clause, the government subsidy line of case law\ndoes not govern the constitutionality of § 2(a)’s bar on\nregistering immoral or scandalous marks. See, e.g., Dep’t\nof Tex., Veterans of Foreign Wars v. Tex. Lottery Comm’n,\n760 F.3d 427, 436 (5th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (holding a\nbingo program that was “merely licensed and regulated by\nthe state” was “wholly distinguishable from the subsidies\nin Taxation with Representation and Rust simply because\nno public monies or ‘spending’ by the state are involved”);\nBullfrog Films, Inc. v. Wick, 847 F.2d 502, 503, 509 (9th\nCir. 1988) (explaining that a treaty under which certain\n“educational, scientific and cultural audio-visual materi-\nals” were granted various benefits, but no federal funds,\nwas “fundamentally different” from government subsidy\nprograms). As the D.C. Circuit noted, “[t]he Supreme\nCourt has never extended the subsidy doctrine to situa-\ntions not involving financial benefits.” Autor v. Pritzker,\n740 F.3d 176, 182–83 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (declining to apply\nthe subsidy doctrine to a presidential directive that im-\npacted committee members who were unpaid). We can\nsee no reason to treat trademark registration differently.\n   If the government is correct that a registration pro-\ngram, such as this, gives the government the authority to\nregulate the content of speech, then every government\nregistration program would provide the government with\nsimilar censorship authority. For example, there is no\n\f20                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nprincipled basis to distinguish between the registration of\ntrademarks and the registration of copyrights under the\ngovernment program rationale. The subsidy line of case\nlaw cannot justify the government’s content-based bar on\nregistering immoral or scandalous marks.\n2. Trademark Registration is Not a Limited Public Forum\n    The constitutionality of speech restrictions on gov-\nernment property are analyzed under the Supreme\nCourt’s “forum analysis,” which “determine[s] when a\ngovernmental entity, in regulating property in its charge,\nmay place limitations on speech.” See, e.g., Christian\nLegal Soc’y of the Univ. of Cal. Hastings Coll. of the Law\nv. Martinez, 561 U.S. 661, 669 (2010). The forum analysis\nis driven by the principle that “the government need not\npermit all forms of speech on property that it owns and\ncontrols.” Int’l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee,\n505 U.S. 672, 678 (1992); see also Lehman v. City of\nShaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 303 (1974) (“In much the\nsame way that a newspaper or periodical, or even a radio\nor television station, need not accept every proffer of\nadvertising from the general public, a city transit system\nhas discretion to develop and make reasonable choices\nconcerning the type of advertising that may be displayed\nin its vehicles.”). The government may not, however,\nrestrict all private speech on its property solely because it\nis the owner. To determine the constitutional bounds of\nspeech restrictions on government property, the forum\nanalysis instructs us to first classify the government’s\nproperty as one of three forums.\n    The first two forums are traditional public forums and\ndesignated public forums. Traditional public forums are\nplaces such as “streets and parks which have immemori-\nally been held in trust for the use of the public and, time\nout of mind, have been used for purposes of assembly,\ncommunicating thoughts between citizens, and discussing\npublic questions.” Perry Educ. Ass’n v. Perry Local Edu-\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          21\n\n\n\ncators’ Ass’n, 460 U.S. 37, 45 (1983) (quotation marks\nomitted). Designated public forums are created when\n“government property that has not traditionally been\nregarded as a public forum is intentionally opened up for\nthat purpose.” Pleasant Grove City, Utah v. Summum,\n555 U.S. 460, 469 (2009). In these forums, “the govern-\nment’s ability to permissibly restrict expressive conduct is\nvery limited.” United States v. Grace, 461 U.S. 171, 177\n(1983). Content-based restrictions on speech “must be\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government\ninterest, and restrictions based on viewpoint are prohibit-\ned.” Pleasant Grove, 555 U.S. at 469 (internal citation\nomitted).\n     The remaining forum category is the limited public fo-\nrum, at times referred to as a non-public forum. Limited\npublic forums are places the government has “limited to\nuse by certain groups or dedicated solely to the discussion\nof certain subjects.” Id. at 470. As with traditional and\ndesignated public forums, regulations that discriminate\nbased on viewpoint in limited public forums are presumed\nunconstitutional. Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of\nUniv. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 830 (1995). Content-based\nrestrictions on speech are subject to a lesser degree of\nscrutiny and remain constitutional “so long as the distinc-\ntions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served\nby the forum.” Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ.\nFund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985). Thus, where the\ngovernment has opened its property for a limited purpose,\nit can constitutionally restrict speech consistent with that\npurpose as long as “the regulation on speech is reasonable\nand not an effort to suppress expression merely because\nofficials oppose the speaker’s view.” Perry, 460 U.S. at 46.\n    The government argues that the federal trademark\nregistration program is a limited public forum, subjecting\n§ 2(a)’s content-based restriction on marks comprising\nimmoral or scandalous subject matter to a less demanding\ndegree of scrutiny. Gov’t Letter Br. 14–15, In re Brunetti,\n\f22                                         IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nNo. 15-1109, Docket No. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017).\nWithout articulating why the federal trademark registra-\ntion program is a limited public forum, the government’s\nletter brief analogizes trademark registration to city\nbuses and a military cemetery. Id. at 14. At oral argu-\nment, the government identified the principal register as\nthe limited public forum, which it contended is a meta-\nphysical forum much like the forum at issue in Rosen-\nberger. Oral Arg. at 28:40–58. 2\n     The Supreme Court has found the existence of a lim-\nited public forum only when the government restricts\nspeech on its own property. At one end of that spectrum\nare venues that are owned and controlled by government\nentities. See, e.g., Greer v. Spock, 424 U.S. 828, 838\n(1976) (military base); Jones v. N.C. Prisoners’ Labor\nUnion, Inc., 433 U.S. 119, 134 (1977) (prison facilities);\nInt’l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, 505 U.S. at 680–83\n(Port Authority airport terminal). These cases unques-\ntionably concern “a governmental entity, . . . regulating\nproperty in its charge.” See Christian Legal, 561 U.S.\nat 669. Other cases involve property that is clearly gov-\nernment owned, although present in public locations. See,\ne.g., United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 727–30\n(1990) (sidewalk outside of Postal Service); Members of\nCity Council of L.A. v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S.\n789, 814 (1984) (public utility poles). Several of the\n\n\n\n     2  Apart from the inconsistency of this argument\nwith the government’s previous representation in Tam—\nin which it stated it did not believe the forum analysis\napplied to trademark registration, and in particular that\nit did not “regard the register itself as a forum”—this\nargument fails as a legal matter. See Tam, 808 F.3d\n1321, Oral Arg. at 1:14:25–1:14:58; Tam, 808 F.3d at 1353\nn.12.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          23\n\n\n\nCourt’s remaining limited public forum cases involve\nspeech restrictions that occur on public school property.\nSee, e.g., Christian Legal, 561 U.S. at 679 n.12 (registered\nstudent organization); Good News Club v. Milford Cent.\nSch., 533 U.S. 98, 106 (2001) (public school opened for\ninstruction and recreation); Lamb’s Chapel v. Ctr.\nMoriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 390–92\n(1993) (public school opened for social, civic, and recrea-\ntional uses); Perry, 460 U.S. at 46–47 (public school mail\nfacilities).\n    While some of the Supreme Court’s limited public fo-\nrum cases have involved forums that exist “more in a\nmetaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense,” these\nforums have nonetheless been tethered to government\nproperties. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 830. In Rosen-\nberger, the Supreme Court considered a University’s\ndistribution of funds through a Student Activities Fund\n(“SAF”) intended to “support a broad range of extracurric-\nular student activities that ‘are related to the educational\npurpose of the University.’” Id. at 824. The Court con-\ncluded the SAF was a limited public forum that “effects a\nsweeping restriction on student thought and student\ninquiry in the context of University sponsored publica-\ntions.” Id. at 829–30, 836. Although the SAF was “meta-\nphysical”—in that it concerned use of the University’s\nfunds rather than the University’s facilities, id. at 830—\nthe effect of its restrictions on speech were felt on the\ngovernment’s property, the University. See id. at 836\n(explaining the SAF “risks the suppression of free speech\nand creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the\nNation’s intellectual life, its college and university cam-\npuses”). The forum at issue in Cornelius likewise involved\na more abstract forum—a charity drive—but that drive\nwas “conducted in the federal workplace during working\nhours.” 473 U.S. at 790. And while the Supreme Court\nhas applied the forum analysis to broadcasting, it did so\nin the context of a state-owned broadcaster’s sponsorship\n\f24                                         IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nof a particular debate at its facilities. See Ark. Educ.\nTelevision Comm’n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 669, 672\n(1998).\n    Because trademarks are by definition used in com-\nmerce, the trademark registration program bears no\nresemblance to these limited public forums. The speech\nthat flows from trademark registration is not tethered to\na public school, federal workplace, or any other govern-\nment property. A principal feature of trademarks is that\nthey help “consumers identify goods and services that\nthey wish to purchase, as well as those they want to\navoid.” Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1751. “These marks make up\npart of the expression of everyday life, as with the names\nof entertainment groups, broadcast networks, designer\nclothing, newspapers, automobiles, candy bars, toys, and\nso on.” Id. at 1768 (Kennedy, J.). By their very purpose,\ntrademarks exist to convey messages throughout com-\nmerce. It is difficult to analogize the Nike swoosh or the\nNike JUST DO IT mark located on a Nike shirt in a Nike\nstore as somehow a government created limited public\nforum. The registration and use of registered trademarks\nsimply does not fit within the rubric of public or limited\npublic forum cases. “[T]he forum analysis requires con-\nsideration not only of whether government property has\nbeen opened to the public, but also of the nature and\npurpose of the property at issue.” Preminger, 517 F.3d\n1299 (internal citations omitted); see also Cornelius, 473\nU.S. at 805 (examining the nature of the government\nproperty involved).\n    A snapshot of marks recently rejected under the im-\nmoral or scandalous provision reveals the breadth of\ngoods and services impacted by § 2(a)’s bar on such\nmarks, including speech occurring on clothing, books,\nwebsites, beverages, mechanical contraptions, and live\nentertainment. These refusals chill speech anywhere\nfrom the Internet to the grocery store. And none of them\ninvolve government property over which the government\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           25\n\n\n\ncan assert a right to “legally preserve the property under\nits control for the use to which it is dedicated.” Lamb’s\nChapel, 508 U.S. at 390.\n    That registered marks also appear on the govern-\nment’s principal register does not transform trademark\nregistration into a limited public forum. The government\ndoes not open the principal register to any exchange of\nideas—it is ancillary to trademark registration. The\nprincipal register is simply a database identifying the\nmarks approved for use in commerce. Oral Arg. at 29:28–\n41. Apart from its function as a database, the govern-\nment has been unable to define exactly what the principal\nregister is, or where it is located. Id. at 29:34–54. If the\ngovernment can constitutionally restrain the expression\nof private speech in commerce because such speech is\nidentified in a government database, so too could the\ngovernment restrain speech occurring on private land or\nin connection with privately-owned vehicles, simply\nbecause those private properties are listed in a database.\nCf. Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1760 (“For if the registration of\ntrademarks constituted government speech, other sys-\ntems of government registration could easily be character-\nized in the same way.”). As the government recognized,\nsuch a suppression of speech would raise serious concerns\nunder the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. See Oral\nArg. at 29:56–30:34 (“[T]he key difference there is the\napplication of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine,\nwhich is the significant constraint on the government’s\nability to abuse its power over something like a land\nregistry to influence speech outside a program.”). The\ngovernment fails to articulate a reason why the govern-\nment’s listing of registered trademarks in a database\ncreates a limited public forum. And if it did then every\ngovernment registration program including titles to land,\nregistration of cars, registration of wills or estates, copy-\nrights, even marriage licenses could similarly implicate a\nlimited public forum. We thus conclude that government\n\f26                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nregistration of trademarks does not create a limited public\nforum in which the government can more freely restrict\nspeech.\n  3.The Prohibition on the Registration of Immoral or\nScandalous Trademarks Targets the Expressive Content\n   of Speech and Therefore Strict Scrutiny Should Be\n                        Applied\n   Commercial speech is speech which does “no more\nthan propose a commercial transaction.” Va. State Bd. of\nPharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425\nU.S. 748, 762 (1976) (citation omitted). Trademarks\ncertainly convey a commercial message, but not exclusive-\nly so. There is no doubt that trademarks “identify the\nsource of a product or service, and therefore play a role in\nthe ‘dissemination of information as to who is producing\nand selling what product, for what reason, and at what\nprice.’” Tam, 808 F.3d at 1338 (quoting Va. State Bd. of\nPharmacy, 425 U.S. at 765). However, trademarks—\nincluding immoral or scandalous trademarks—also “often\nhave an expressive content.” Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1760.\nFor immoral or scandalous marks, this message is often\nuncouth. But it can espouse a powerful cause. See, e.g.,\nFUCK HEROIN, Appl. No. 86,361,326; FUCK CANCER,\nAppl.     No. 86,290,011;     FUCK      RACISM,       Appl.\nNo. 85,608,559. It can put forth a political view, see\nDEMOCRAT.BS,            Appl.      No. 77,042,069,        or\nREPUBLICAN.BS, Appl. No. 77,042,071.            While the\nspeech expressed in trademarks is brief, “powerful mes-\nsages can sometimes be conveyed in just a few words.”\nTam, 137 S. Ct. at 1760.\n   The test used by the PTO to prohibit immoral or scan-\ndalous marks is whether a “substantial composite of the\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           27\n\n\n\ngeneral public” 3 would find the mark “shocking to the\nsense of truth, decency, or propriety; disgraceful; offen-\nsive; disreputable; . . . giving offense to the conscience or\nmoral feelings; . . . or calling out for condemnation.” Fox,\n702 F.3d at 665. There can be no question that the im-\nmoral or scandalous prohibition targets the expressive\ncomponents of the speech. As in this case, the agency\noften justifies its rejection of marks on the grounds that\nthey convey offensive ideas. J.A. 8–9 (explaining that Mr.\nBrunetti’s use of his trademark is scandalous because his\nmark “objectifies women and offers degrading examples of\nextreme misogyny” and contains a theme “of extreme\nnihilism” with “anti-social imagery” and is “lacking in\ntaste”). These are each value judgments about the ex-\npressive message behind the trademark. Whether marks\ncomprise immoral or scandalous subject matter hinges on\nthe expressive, not source-identifying, nature of trade-\nmarks.\n   While different provisions of the Lanham Act may ap-\npropriately be classified as targeting a mark’s source-\nidentifying information—for example, § 2(e)’s bar on\nregistering marks that are “merely descriptive” or “geo-\ngraphically descriptive”—the immoral or scandalous\nprovision targets a mark’s expressive message, which is\nseparate and distinct from the commercial purpose of a\nmark as a source identifier. Justice Kennedy explained in\nhis concurrence: “The central purpose of trademark\nregistration is to facilitate source identification. . . .\nWhether a mark is disparaging bears no plausible rela-\ntion to that goal.” 137 S. Ct. at 1768 (Kennedy, J.). We\nfind the same logic applies to the immoral or scandalous\n\n\n\n    3   The PTO justifies its refusals by “tying censorship\nto the reaction of the speaker’s audience.” See Tam, 137\nS. Ct. at 1766 (Kennedy, J.).\n\f28                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nprohibition. As in the case of disparaging marks, the\nPTO’s rejections under § 2(a)’s bar on immoral or scandal-\nous marks are necessarily based in the government’s\nbelief that the rejected mark conveys an expressive mes-\nsage—namely, a message that is scandalous or offensive\nto a substantial composite of the general population. See\nTam, 808 F.3d at 1338. Section 2(a) regulates the expres-\nsive components of speech, not the commercial compo-\nnents of speech, and as such it should be subject to strict\nscrutiny. See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.S.\n552, 565 (2011). There is no dispute that § 2(a)’s bar on\nthe registration of immoral or scandalous marks is uncon-\nstitutional if strict scrutiny applies.\n     4. Section 2(a)’s Bar on Immoral or Scandalous Marks\n            Does Not Survive Intermediate Scrutiny\n    Section 2(a)’s bar on the registration of immoral or\nscandalous marks is unconstitutional even if treated as a\nregulation of purely commercial speech reviewed accord-\ning to the intermediate scrutiny framework established in\nCentral Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. Intermediate scrutiny\nrequires that “the State must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental\ninterest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that\ninterest.” Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 572.\n    Commercial speech is subject to a four-part test which\nasks whether (1) the speech concerns lawful activity and\nis not misleading; (2) the asserted government interest is\nsubstantial; (3) the regulation directly advances that\ngovernment interest; and (4) whether the regulation is\n“not more extensive than necessary to serve that inter-\nest.” Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566; see also Bd. of Tr.\nof State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 479–80 (1989)\n(explaining the fourth prong of Central Hudson requires\n“not necessarily the least restrictive means but . . . a\nmeans narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objec-\ntive”). “Under a commercial speech inquiry, it is the\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                        29\n\n\n\nState’s burden to justify its content-based law as con-\nsistent with the First Amendment.” Sorrell, 564 U.S.\nat 565.\n    The immoral or scandalous provision clearly meets\nthe first prong of the Central Hudson test, which requires\nwe first confirm the speech “concern lawful activity and\nnot be misleading.” 447 U.S. at 566. Section 2(a)’s provi-\nsion barring immoral or scandalous marks, like the dis-\nparagement provision, does not address misleading,\ndeceptive, or unlawful marks. Rather it is concerned with\nwhether a mark is offensive, scandalous, or vulgar to a\nsubstantial composite of the general public.\n    Central Hudson’s second prong, requiring a substan-\ntial government interest, is not met. The only govern-\nment interest related to the immoral or scandalous\nprovision that we can discern from the government’s\nbriefing is its interest in “protecting public order and\nmorality.” Gov’t Letter Br. 15 & n.6, In re Brunetti,\nNo. 15-1109, Docket No. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017). 4 At\noral argument, the government struggled to identify the\nsubstantial interest in barring registration of trademarks\ncomprising immoral or scandalous subject matter. The\ngovernment framed its interest based on the government’s\nown perception of proposed marks, including what types\nof marks the government would “want to promote” or “has\ndeemed to be most suitable.” Oral Arg. at 22:35–41,\n\n\n   4    The government’s brief also made an errant refer-\nence to its interest “in the orderly flow of commerce.”\nGov’t Letter Br. 15, In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket\nNo. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017). While we do not question\nthe substantiality of this interest, the government has\nfailed to articulate how this interest is in any way ad-\nvanced by the immoral or scandalous prohibition, or how\nthat provision is narrowly tailored to that interest.\n\f30                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n22:56–23:00. At another point, the government indicated\nits interest is to shield its examiners from immoral or\nscandalous marks: “whether or not its examiners are\nforced to decide whether one drawing of genitalia is\nconfusingly similar to another drawing of genitalia.” Id.\nat 21:51–22:12.     Ultimately, the government stated,\n“Congress’ primary interest is the promotion of the use of\nnon-scandalous marks in commerce.” Id. at 23:33–42; see\nalso id. at 25:21–32 (“Promoting commerce that doesn’t\ninclude the use of source identifiers that are graphic\nsexual images or profanities that are going to be off-\nputting to a substantial composite of the public.”).\nWhichever articulation of the government’s interest we\nchoose, the government has failed to identify a substan-\ntial interest justifying its suppression of immoral or\nscandalous trademarks. 5\n    First, the government does not have a substantial in-\nterest in promoting certain trademarks over others. The\nSupreme Court rejected the government’s claim that\ntrademarks are government speech. Tam, 137 S. Ct.\nat 1757–61. Our conclusion that trademark registration\nis neither a government subsidy nor a limited public\nforum forecloses any remaining interest the government\nmay have in approving only marks it “has deemed to be\nmost suitable.” Oral Arg. at 22:56–23:00; see also Tam,\n\n\n\n     5  We note that the government hardly met its bur-\nden to identify a government interest at all. To identify\nthis purported interest, the government has done no more\nthan “taken the effect of the statute and posited that effect\nas the State’s interest. If accepted, this sort of circular\ndefense can sidestep judicial review of almost any statute,\nbecause it makes all statutes look narrowly tailored.”\nSimon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime\nVictims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120 (1991).\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                              31\n\n\n\n137 S. Ct. at 1760–63 (plurality rejecting the government\nsubsidy argument) (Alito, J.).\n     Second, Supreme Court precedent makes clear that\nthe government’s general interest in protecting the public\nfrom marks it deems “off-putting,” whether to protect the\ngeneral public or the government itself, is not a substan-\ntial interest justifying broad suppression of speech. “[T]he\nfact that society may find speech offensive is not a suffi-\ncient reason for suppressing it.” Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.\nFalwell, 485 U.S. 46, 55 (1988); Bolger v. Youngs Drug\nProds. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 71 (1983) (“At least where\nobscenity is not involved, we have consistently held that\nthe fact that protected speech may be offensive to some\ndoes not justify its suppression.” (citation omitted));\nCohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15, 21 (1971) (“[T]he mere\npresumed presence of unwitting listeners or viewers does\nnot serve automatically to justify curtailing all speech\ncapable of giving offense.”); Cox, 379 U.S. at 551\n(“[C]onstitutional rights may not be denied simply be-\ncause of hostility to their assertion or exercise.”). “Where\nthe designed benefit of a content-based speech restriction\nis to shield the sensibilities of listeners, the general rule is\nthat the right of expression prevails, even where no less\nrestrictive alternative exists.” Playboy, 529 U.S. at 813.\n    The Supreme Court’s decision in Tam supports our\nconclusion that the government’s interest in protecting\nthe public from off-putting marks is an inadequate gov-\nernment interest for First Amendment purposes. See,\ne.g., 137 S. Ct. at 1764 (applying Central Hudson and\nrejecting the government’s “interest in preventing speech\nexpressing ideas that offend” because “that idea strikes at\nthe heart of the First Amendment”) (Alito, J.). In Tam,\nthe Court acknowledged that it is a “bedrock First\nAmendment principle” that “Speech may not be banned\non the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.” Tam,\n137 S. Ct. at 1751 (Alito, J.); see also id. at 1767 (“[T]he\nCourt’s cases have long prohibited the government from\n\f32                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\njustifying a First Amendment burden by pointing to the\noffensiveness of the speech to be suppressed.”) (Kennedy,\nJ.). Both Justice Alito’s and Justice Kennedy’s opinions\nsupport their conclusions that the disparagement provi-\nsion is unconstitutional citing cases holding “the public\nexpression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because\nthe ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hear-\ners.” Id. at 1763 (collecting cases) (quoting Street v. New\nYork, 394 U.S. 576, 592 (1969)) (Alito, J.); id. at 1767\n(citing Justice Alito’s opinion at 1763–64) (Kennedy, J.);\nsee also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414 (1989) (“If\nthere is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amend-\nment, it is that the government may not prohibit the\nexpression of an idea simply because society finds the idea\nitself offensive or disagreeable.”); Coates v. Cincinnati,\n402 U.S. 611, 615 (1971) (“[M]ere public intolerance or\nanimosity cannot be the basis for abridgment of these\nconstitutional freedoms.”). The government’s interest in\nsuppressing speech because it is off-putting is unavailing.\n    While the government’s interest in Tam related to a\nviewpoint-based restriction on speech, we note the cases\non which the Supreme Court relied are not so limited.\nThe cases cited in Tam are directed to speech that may be\noffensive, but not all involve speech that is disparaging or\nviewpoint discriminatory. Many involve speech that,\nrather than disparaging others, involved peaceful demon-\nstrations. See, e.g., Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.S. 564,\n566–67 (1970) (peaceful Vietnam war protest carrying\nsigns such as “Make Love not War”); Tinker v. Des Moines\nIndep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 509–14 (1969)\n(wearing black armbands to protest Vietnam war); Cox v.\nLouisiana, 379 U.S. 536, 545, 550–51 (1965) (protesting\nsegregation and discrimination); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299\nU.S. 353, 365 (1937) (peaceful political meeting). Several\nother cases do not appear to involve viewpoint discrimina-\ntion at all. For example, Hustler Magazine concerned a\nparody interview of Jerry Falwell in which the actor\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            33\n\n\n\nplaying him stated his “‘first time’ was during a drunken\nincestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse.”\n485 U.S. at 48. While such a parody interview is offen-\nsive, its function as a parody does not clearly involve the\nexpression of beliefs, ideas, or perspectives. Similarly, the\nordinance at issue in Coates was not limited to restricting\ndisparaging speech or certain viewpoints, but prohibited\nany conduct perceived as “annoying to persons passing\nby.” 402 U.S. at 611. The Supreme Court’s narrative that\nthe government cannot justify restricting speech because\nit offends, together with its reliance on cases involving a\nvariety of different speech restrictions, reinforce our\nconclusion that the government’s interest in protecting\nthe public from off-putting marks is not substantial.\n    Finally, the government does not have a substantial\ninterest in protecting the public from scandalousness and\nprofanities. The government attempts to justify this\ninterest by pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in\nFCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). In\nPacifica, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality\nof the FCC’s declaratory order determining that an after-\nnoon radio broadcast of George Carlin’s “Filthy Words”\nmonologue was indecent and potentially sanctionable. Id.\nat 730–32. The Court explained “references to excretory\nand sexual material . . . surely lie at the periphery of First\nAmendment concern.” Id. at 742. The Court justified the\nFCC’s order, however, because radio broadcasting has “a\nuniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans”\nand is “uniquely accessible to children, even those too\nyoung to read,” confronting Americans “in the privacy of\nthe home, where the individual’s right to be left alone\nplainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an\nintruder.” Id. at 749. The Court stressed: “It is appropri-\nate to emphasize the narrowness of our holding.” Id. at\n750. Subsequent precedent explained that other mediums\nof communication, such as dial-in-services or the Internet,\nare “manifestly different from a situation in which a\n\f34                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nlistener does not want the received message.” Sable\nCommc’ns of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 128 (1989)\n(“Unlike an unexpected outburst on a radio broadcast, the\nmessage received by one who places a call to a dial-a-porn\nservice is not so invasive or surprising that it prevents an\nunwilling listener from avoiding exposure to it.”); Reno v.\nAm. Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844, 868–69 (1997)\n(explaining Pacifica does not control because “the Internet\nis not as ‘invasive’ as radio or television”).\n    The government’s interest in protecting the public\nfrom profane and scandalous marks is not akin to the\ngovernment’s interest in protecting children and other\nunsuspecting listeners from a barrage of swear words over\nthe radio in Pacifica. A trademark is not foisted upon\nlisteners by virtue of its being registered. Nor does regis-\ntration make a scandalous mark more accessible to chil-\ndren. Absent any concerns that trademark registration\ninvades a substantial privacy interest in an intolerable\nmanner, the government’s interest amounts to protecting\neveryone, including adults, from scandalous content. But\neven when “many adults themselves would find the\nmaterial highly offensive,” adults have a First Amend-\nment right to view and hear speech that is profane and\nscandalous. Playboy, 529 U.S. at 811 (First Amendment\nright to view “sexually explicit adult programming or\nother programming that is indecent”); Sable, 492 U.S.\nat 115 (“Sexual expression which is indecent but not\nobscene is protected by the First Amendment.”). In\ncrafting a substantial government interest, “the govern-\nment may not ‘reduce the adult population . . . to . . . only\nwhat is fit for children.’” Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73 (citation\nomitted); cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 131 (“[T]he statute’s denial\nof adult access to telephone messages which are indecent\nbut not obscene far exceeds that which is necessary to\nlimit the access of minors to such messages . . . .”).\n   Even if we were to hold that the government has a\nsubstantial interest in protecting the public from scandal-\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           35\n\n\n\nous or immoral marks, the government could not meet the\nthird prong of Central Hudson, which requires the regula-\ntion directly advance the government’s asserted interest.\n447 U.S. at 566. As the government has repeatedly\nexhorted, § 2(a) does not directly prevent applicants from\nusing their marks. Regardless of whether a trademark is\nfederally registered, an applicant can still brand clothing\nwith his mark, advertise with it on the television or radio,\nor place it on billboards along the highway. In this elec-\ntronic/Internet age, to the extent that the government\nseeks to protect the general population from scandalous\nmaterial, with all due respect, it has completely failed.\n    Finally, no matter the government’s interest, it cannot\nmeet the fourth prong of Central Hudson. The PTO’s\ninconsistent application of the immoral or scandalous\nprovision creates an “uncertainty [that] undermines the\nlikelihood that the [provision] has been carefully tailored.”\nSee Reno, 521 U.S. at 871. Nearly identical marks have\nbeen approved by one examining attorney and rejected as\nscandalous or immoral by another. The PTO registered\nthe mark FUGLY for use on clothing, but refused regis-\ntration for use on alcoholic beverages. Compare Reg.\nNo. 5,135,615, with Appl. No. 78,866,347.

Although the language in\nthese marks is offensive, we cannot discern any pattern\nindicating when the incorporation of an offensive term\ninto a mark will serve as a bar to registration and when it\nwill not.\n\f36                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n    One commentator has written that, of the forty marks\ncontaining the acronym MILF for which written records\nwere available as of 2011, twenty marks received an office\naction refusing registration based on § 2(a), while twenty\ndid not. Anne Gilson LaLonde & Jerome Gilson, Trade-\nmarks Laid Bare: Marks That May Be Scandalous or\nImmoral, 101 Trademark Rep. 1476, 1478–82 (2011). It is\ndifficult to understand what distinguished the refused\nmarks, which included GOT MILF (clothing), MILF\nMANIA (adult online services), MILF SEEKER (adult\nentertainment services), and FROM SOCCER MOM TO\nMILF (self-help books for women), from the marks which\nwere registered, including DIARY OF A MILF (adult\nonline services), BACKROOM MILF (adult online ser-\nvices), FAT MILF (sandwich), and MILF NEXT DOOR\n(adult online services). Id. Another empirical study\nidentified words that served as the basis of a § 2(a) refusal\nin some marks but were material components of other\nmarks approved by the PTO.

It can no\ndoubt be a difficult task to determine public perceptions of\na trademark’s morality or immorality, offensiveness, or\neven vulgarity. As the Supreme Court has explained, “it\nis largely because governmental officials cannot make\nprincipled distinctions in this area that the Constitution\nleaves matters of taste and style so largely to the individ-\nual.” Cohen, 403 U.S. at 25. To be sure, there are other\ntrademark’s whose offensiveness cannot be reasonably\nquestioned; the government attached an appendix with\nexamples of such marks which it has rejected to this\ncourt. But the subjectivity in the determination of what is\nimmoral or scandalous and the disparate and unpredicta-\nble application of these principles cause us to conclude\nthat the prohibition at issue in this case would also fail\nthe fourth prong of the Central Hudson analysis.\n   We conclude that the government has not presented us\nwith a substantial government interest justifying the\n§ 2(a) bar on immoral or scandalous marks. As we con-\n\n\n\nmoral or scandalous provision also raise concerns about\nthe provision’s vagueness. See Tam, 808 F.3d at 1359\n(O’Malley, J., concurring) (opining that § 2(a)’s bar on\ndisparaging marks was unconstitutionally vague and\nidentifying examples “where there is no conceivable\ndifference between the applied-for marks, yet one is\napproved and the other rejected”). We need not reach\nwhether the immoral or scandalous provision is so vague\nthat it violates the Fifth Amendment.\n\f38                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\ncluded in Tam, “All of the government’s proffered inter-\nests boil down to permitting the government to burden\nspeech it finds offensive.” Tam, 808 F.3d at 1357. We\nalso conclude that the government has failed to demon-\nstrate that its restriction will advance the interests it\nasserts and that it is narrowly tailored to achieve that\nobjective. Section 2(a)’s bar on immoral or scandalous\nmarks does not survive intermediate scrutiny under\nCentral Hudson.\n  5. There Is No Reasonable Definition of the Statutory\n Terms Scandalous and Immoral Which Would Preserve\n                 Their Constitutionality\n    We construe statutes narrowly to preserve their con-\nstitutionality, when possible. See Schneider v. Smith,\n390 U.S. 17, 26 (1968). However, “[t]he infringement of\nFirst Amendment rights will not be cured if the narrow-\ning construction is so unforeseeable that men of common\nintelligence could not have realized the law’s limited\nscope at the only relevant time, when their acts were\ncommitted, or if the law remains excessively sweeping\neven as narrowed.” Gregory v. City of Chi., 394 U.S. 111,\n121 (1969) (citations omitted). Our duty to avoid constitu-\ntional questions “is not a license for the judiciary to\nrewrite language enacted by the legislature. Any other\nconclusion, while purporting to be an exercise in judicial\nrestraint, would trench upon the legislative powers vested\nin Congress.” United States v. Albertini, 472 U.S. 675,\n680 (1985) (citations omitted). It is thus permissible to\nconstrue a statute in a manner that preserves its consti-\ntutionality only where the construction is reasonable.\n\n   The concurrence agrees that the scandalous and im-\nmoral prohibitions as construed by the government, this\ncourt, and our predecessor court are unconstitutional.\nThis court and its predecessor have consistently defined\n“scandalous” as “shocking to the sense of truth, decency,\nor propriety; disgraceful; offensive; disreputable; giving\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          39\n\n\n\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings; or calling out\nfor condemnation.” Fox, 702 F.3d at 635; accord McGin-\nley, 660 F.2d at 485; Riverbank Canning Co., 95 F.3d at\n328. The concurrence proposes that we “narrow the\nimmoral-scandalous provision’s scope to obscene marks in\norder to preserve its constitutionality.” Conc. Op. 5–6.\nWhile the legislature could rewrite the statute to adopt\nsuch a standard, we cannot.\n    It is not reasonable to construe the words immoral\nand scandalous as confined to obscene material. There is\nno dispute that an obscene mark would be scandalous or\nimmoral; however, not all scandalous or immoral marks\nare obscene. All apples are fruit, but not all fruits are\napples. As the PTO has explained, “the threshold for\nobjectionable matter is lower for what can be described as\n‘scandalous’ than for ‘obscene.’” J.A. 4 (citation omitted);\naccord McGinley, 660 F.2d at 487 n.9. The PTO has for a\ncentury rejected marks as scandalous or immoral that are\nclearly not obscene. As set forth above, many of the early\ncases applying the immoral or scandalous provision\ninvolved blasphemous marks touching on religion, which\nwere not obscene. 7\n\n\n\n   7    With no authority, the concurrence suggests “the\ncentral aim of the immoral-scandalous provision . . . has\nbeen sexual material.” Conc. Op. 6–7. To the contrary,\nthere is a long history of rejecting numerous categories of\nnon-sexual material under this provision. See generally\nLaLonde & Gilson, supra, at 1510–14, 1517–33 (discuss-\ning the application of the provision to marks related to\nreligion, drug references, violence, disparaging patriotic\nsymbols, mild profanity, and scatological references).\nMoreover, the concurrence suggests narrowing the im-\nmoral or scandalous provision to obscene material would\n\f40                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n    The Supreme Court has made clear that the definition\nof obscenity for purposes of the First Amendment is\n“material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to\nprurient interest,” i.e., “material having a tendency to\nexcite lustful thoughts.” Roth v. United States, 354 U.S.\n476, 487 & n.20 (1957). This “definition does not reflect\nthe precise meaning of ‘obscene’ as traditionally used in\nthe English language,” and instead is limited to “obscene\nmaterial ‘which deals with sex.’” Miller v. California, 413\nU.S. 15, 20 n.2 (1973) (emphasis added).\n\n    Despite the concurrence’s suggestion to the contrary,\nnone of the dictionary definitions cited define “immoral”\nor “scandalous” in sexual terms. 8 Immoral, Black’s Law\nDictionary (1st ed. 1891) (“Contrary to good morals;\ninconsistent with the rules and principles of morality\nwhich regard men as living in a community, and which\nare necessary for the public welfare, order, and decency.”);\nImmoral, Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (1898) (“Not\nmoral; inconsistent with good morals; contrary to con-\nscience or the divine law.”); Scandalous, Id. (“1. Giving\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings. 2. Disgraceful\n\n\n\nbe consistent with PTO action. The marks cited by the\nconcurrence, like the FUCT mark at issue in this case,\nwould not be properly refused under a prohibition limited\nto obscenity. See Conc. Op. 7 n.7.\n    8    The concurrence’s reliance on overlapping diction-\nary definitions of “immoral,” “scandalous,” and “obscene”\nignores this important limitation. The question before us\nis not whether the obscene material is “immoral” and\n“scandalous,” but rather whether Congress intended the\nterms “immoral” or “scandalous” to be confined to materi-\nal that is “obscene” for the purposes of a First Amendment\nanalysis.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          41\n\n\n\nto reputation; opprobrious. 3. Defamatory; libelous.”);\nImmoral, Webster’s Complete Dictionary (1886) (“Not\nmoral; inconsistent rectitude; contrary to conscience or\nthe divine law; wicked; unjust; dishonest; vicious”); Scan-\ndalous, Id. (“1. Giving offense; exciting reprobation;\ncalling out condemnation; extremely offensive to duty or\npropriety” “2. Disgraceful to reputation; bringing shame\nor infamy; opprobrious” “3. Defamatory; libelous”).\n\n    Unlike the terms “immoral” and “scandalous,” the\nstatutory terms at issue in the cases cited in the concur-\nrence are by their nature limited to material “which deals\nwith sex.” See, e.g., Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472\nU.S. 491, 494 (1985) (construing phrase “that which\nincites lasciviousness or lust”); Manual Enters., Inc. v.\nDay, 370 U.S. 478, 482–83 (1962) (opinion of Harlan, J.)\n(“While in common usage the words have different shades\nof meaning, the statute since its inception has always\nbeen taken as aimed at obnoxiously debasing portrayals\nof sex.” (footnote omitted)); Swearingen v. United States,\n161 U.S. 446, 451 (1896) (“The words ‘obscene,’ ‘lewd,’ and\n‘lascivious,’ as used in the statute, signify that form of\nimmorality which has relation to sexual impurity . . . .”).\nWe do not see how the words “immoral” and “scandalous”\ncould reasonably be read to be limited to material of a\nsexual nature. We cannot stand in the shoes of the legis-\nlature and rewrite a statute.\n                       CONCLUSION\n   The trademark at issue is vulgar. And the govern-\nment included an appendix in its briefing to the court\nwhich contains numerous highly offensive, even shocking,\nimages and words for which individuals have sought\ntrademark registration. Many of the marks rejected\nunder § 2(a)’s bar on immoral or scandalous marks,\nincluding the marks discussed in this opinion, are lewd,\ncrass, or even disturbing. We find the use of such marks\nin commerce discomforting, and are not eager to see a\n\f42                                         IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nproliferation of such marks in the marketplace. There\nare, however, a cadre of similarly offensive images and\nwords that have secured copyright registration by the\ngovernment. There are countless songs with vulgar lyrics,\nblasphemous images, scandalous books and paintings, all\nof which are protected under federal law. No doubt many\nworks registered with the Copyright Office offend a sub-\nstantial composite of the general public. There are words\nand images that we do not wish to be confronted with, not\nas art, nor in the marketplace. The First Amendment,\nhowever, protects private expression, even private expres-\nsion which is offensive to a substantial composite of the\ngeneral public. The government has offered no substan-\ntial government interest for policing offensive speech in\nthe context of a registration program such as the one at\nissue in this case.\n    We hold that the bar in § 2(a) against immoral or\nscandalous marks is unconstitutional because it violates\nthe First Amendment. We reverse the Board’s holding\nthat Mr. Brunetti’s mark is unregistrable under § 2(a).\n                      REVERSED\n\f  United States Court of Appeals\n      for the Federal Circuit\n                  ______________________\n\n               IN RE: ERIK BRUNETTI,\n                        Appellant\n                 ______________________\n\n                        2015-1109\n                  ______________________\n\n    Appeal from the United States Patent and Trademark\nOffice, Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in No.\n85310960.\n                 ______________________\nDYK, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment.\n    The majority today strikes down as unconstitutional a\ncentury-old provision of the Lanham Act that prohibits\nthe registration of “immoral . . . or scandalous” marks. 15\nU.S.C. § 1052(a). In doing so, it notes our obligation to\n“construe statutes narrowly to preserve their constitu-\ntionality, when possible.” Maj. Op. 38. It concludes,\nhowever, that there is no such reasonable narrow con-\nstruction. Id. at 38-41. I think that such a saving con-\nstruction is possible and that we are obligated to adopt it.\n    As an initial matter, I agree with the majority that\nthe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Matal v. Tam, 137\nS. Ct. 1744 (2017), does not dictate the facial invalidity of\nthe immoral-scandalous provision. Tam held only that\nthe disparagement provision of the Lanham Act was\nunconstitutional because it was not viewpoint neutral; it\ndid not address the immoral-scandalous provision at issue\nhere. See id. at 1763-65 (plurality op.); id. at 1765-69\n(Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\n\f2                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\njudgment). So too did the opinions reserve judgment as to\nthe other Lanham Act provisions. Id. at 1763 n.16 (plu-\nrality op.) (“We leave open the question whether this is\nthe appropriate framework for analyzing free speech\nchallenges to provisions of the Lanham Act.”); id. at 1768\n(Kennedy, J.) (“This case does not present the question of\nhow other provisions of the Lanham Act should be ana-\nlyzed under the First Amendment.”). Nonetheless, I also\nagree that the immoral-scandalous provision raises some\nserious First Amendment questions, as the majority\nopinion concludes. See Maj. Op. 28-38. 1\n    I think that we are obligated to construe the statute\nto avoid these constitutional questions. Courts must,\n“where possible, construe federal statutes so as ‘to avoid\nserious doubt of their constitutionality.’” Stern v. Mar-\nshall, 564 U.S. 462, 477 (2011) (quoting Commodity\nFutures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 841\n(1986)). A saving construction of a statute need only be\n“fairly possible,” and “every reasonable construction must\nbe resorted to.” Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567\nU.S. 519, 563 (2012) (first quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285\nU.S. 22, 62 (1932); then quoting Hooper v. California, 155\nU.S. 648, 657 (1895)).\n    One such fairly possible reading is available to us\nhere by limiting the clause’s reach to obscene marks,\nwhich are not protected by the First Amendment. Where\nthe regulation of speech is concerned, the Supreme Court\nhas a long history of narrowing the scope of similarly\nworded statutes to cover only obscene speech. The most\n\n\n    1    The majority states that I “agree[] that the scan-\ndalous and immoral prohibitions . . . are unconstitution-\nal.” Id. at 38. As discussed more fully below, following\nthe Supreme Court’s instructions, I would adopt a nar-\nrowing construction specifically in order to avoid these\ndifficult constitutional questions.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                             3\n\n\n\nprominent examples are the federal obscenity statutes. In\n1896, the Supreme Court considered an early version of\nthese laws, which criminalized the mailing of “obscene,\nlewd or lascivious” materials. Swearingen v. United\nStates, 161 U.S. 446, 450 (1896). While acknowledging\nthat “it might be inferred that each of those epithets\npointed out a distinct offense”—the familiar canon against\nsuperfluities—the Court nevertheless construed the\nstatute narrowly to “describ[e] one and the same offense,”\nnamely, the mailing of obscene materials. Id.\n    The obscenity statutes were later amended to include\nan even broader description of the targeted matter.\nToday, 18 U.S.C. § 1461 criminalizes the mailing of any\n“obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article,”\nand § 1462 criminalizes the importation of “obscene, lewd,\nlascivious, or filthy” materials. Nonetheless, in a series of\nopinions in the 1960s and ’70s, the Supreme Court con-\nstrued this broader language narrowly to apply only to\nobscenity in order to avoid constitutional doubts. See\nHamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 114 (1974) (limit-\ning § 1461 to obscenity to avoid a vagueness challenge);\nUnited States v. 12 200-Ft. Reels of Super 8mm. Film, 413\nU.S. 123, 129-30, 130 n.7 (1973) (same with respect to\n§ 1462); Manual Enters., Inc. v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 482-83\n(1962) (plurality op.) (footnote omitted) (“While in com-\nmon usage the words have different shades of meaning,\nthe statute since its inception has always been taken as\naimed at obnoxiously debasing portrayals of sex.”). The\nSupreme Court took a similar approach when rejecting an\noverbreadth challenge to a Washington statute that\ndefined “prurient” as “that which incites lasciviousness or\nlust,” Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 494\n\f4                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n(1985), construing the statute’s reference to lust to reach\nonly obscenity, id. at 504-05. 2\n     As the Supreme Court has done with the obscenity\nstatutes, here when faced with constitutional doubt as to\nthe immoral-scandalous provision, we should adopt a\nnarrowing construction and limit the statute to obsceni-\nty. 3 As in the earlier Supreme Court cases, there is no\nquestion that the trademark statute bars registration of\nobscene marks. While the statute does not use the word\n“obscene” to define its scope, the absence of the word in\nmy view makes a narrowing construction easier rather\nthan more difficult, since it suggests that the drafters did\nnot use the word “obscene” to differentiate “immoral” and\n“scandalous” material from obscenity. 4 And the fact that\n\n\n\n    2    I am aware of only one case in which the Supreme\nCourt declined to construe similar language as limited to\nobscenity. FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 738-\n41, 741 n.17 (1978), having arisen in the broadcasting\ncontext, is quite different from the present situation.\n    3    Of course, if this were a state rather than federal\nstatute, the different standard for narrowing construc-\ntions might dictate a different result. See, e.g., Conchatta\nInc. v. Miller, 458 F.3d 258, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2006).\n    4    Our predecessor court noted that “the threshold\nfor objectionable matter is lower for what can be described\nas ‘scandalous’ than for ‘obscene,’” which suggests that\nany marks meeting the threshold for obscenity would also\nbe considered scandalous. In re McGinley, 660 F.2d 481,\n485 n.9 (CCPA 1981), overruled on other grounds by In re\nTam, 808 F.3d 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (en banc), aff’d, 137\nS. Ct. 1744. To the extent that McGinley supports a\nconstruction of the immoral-scandalous provision that is\nbroader than just obscenity, we are not bound by that\nconstruction given the constitutional doubts raised in this\ncase and the intervening changes in the case law since\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            5\n\n\n\nthe immoral-scandalous provision may appear to be\nbroader than obscenity does not preclude our adopting a\nnarrowing construction of the statute. Contemporary\ndictionaries from the period before the 1905 enactment of\nthe provision suggest that “immoral” and “scandalous”\nwere understood as equivalent to “obscene.” For example,\n“obscene” was itself listed as a synonym for “immoral.” 5\n   Under these circumstances, we can appropriately nar-\nrow the immoral-scandalous provision’s scope to obscene\n\n\n\n\nthat 1981 decision, including Tam. See, e.g., Troy v.\nSamson Mfg. Corp., 758 F.3d 1322, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n     5   Immoral, Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (1898);\nImmoral, Webster’s Complete Dictionary (1886). In addi-\ntion, all three words were defined in terms of giving\noffense to morals, and “obscene” and “immoral” were\nspecifically defined in opposition to chastity. Immoral,\nWebster’s Collegiate Dictionary (“inconsistent with good\nmorals,” “unchaste”); Obscene, id. (“[o]ffensive to chasti-\nty”); Scandalous, id. (“[g]iving offense to the conscience or\nmoral feelings”); Immoral, Black’s Law Dictionary (1st ed.\n1891) (“[c]ontrary to good morals”); Obscene, id. (“calcu-\nlated to shock the moral sense of man by a disregard of\nchastity or modesty”); Immoral, Webster’s Complete Dic-\ntionary (“[n]ot moral,” “unchaste”); Obscene, id.\n(“[o]ffensive to chastity and delicacy”); Scandalous, id.\n(“[g]iving offense”). Finally, “immoral” and “obscene”\nshared a number of other synonyms, including “lewd,”\n“impure,” and “indecent.” Immoral, Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary (“impure,” “lewd”); Obscene, id. (“indecent;\nimpure; lewd”); Immoral, Webster’s Complete Dictionary\n(“impure,” “lewd”); Obscene, id. (“[i]mpure,” “indecent,”\n“lewd”); Obscene, Black’s Law Dictionary (“[l]ewd; impure;\nindecent”).\n\f6                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nmarks in order to preserve its constitutionality, and we\nare obligated to do so. 6\n    The majority recognizes that we have an obligation to\nconstrue statutes to preserve their constitutionality. Maj.\nOp. 38. But the majority provides no plausible reason for\nfailure to narrowly construe the language in § 1052(a) to\navoid the evident problems created by a broader construc-\ntion. To be sure, as the majority points out, the words\n“immoral” and “scandalous” could have a broader mean-\ning than “obscenity,” a broader meaning fraught with\nconstitutional problems. But the potential breadth of the\nlanguage is hardly a reason to reject a narrowing con-\nstruction; rather, it is the very reason that a narrowing\nconstruction is appropriate. And the majority offers no\nconvincing basis for distinguishing this case from the\nSupreme Court cases, discussed above, narrowing the\nconstruction of very similar language to obscenity. The\nmajority appears to suggest that in those Supreme Court\ncases, the statutory concern with sexual representations\nwas evident but that here that connection is absent. In\nfact, the central aim of the immoral-scandalous provision\nin this court’s cases has been sexual material reflected in\n\n\n\n\n    6   We are under this obligation notwithstanding the\nfact that the government has not advocated for such a\nnarrowing construction. For example, in Spokane Ar-\ncades, the Supreme Court adopted a narrowing construc-\ntion despite the state officials’ arguments that the statute\nwas facially constitutional and not in need of narrowing.\n472 U.S. at 501-05; see also SKF USA, Inc. v. U.S. Cus-\ntoms & Border Prot., 556 F.3d 1337, 1353 (Fed.

Interestingly, the scholarly analysis of the\nscandalous-immoral provision relied on by the majority\nhas suggested that an amendment to the statute narrow-\n\n\n\n\n   7    See In re Fox, 702 F.3d 633 (Fed.

Although LaLonde and\nGilson provide other historical examples of prior rejec-\ntions for religious references, LaLonde & Gilson, supra, at\n1510-13, they also explain that the PTO has since directed\nthat rejections based on offense to religion should be\ngrounded in the (now-invalidated) disparagement provi-\nsion rather than the scandalous-immoral provision, see id.\nat 1511.\n\f8                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\ning its scope to obscene marks would preserve the core of\nthe provision. 10\n                         * * *\n    The First Amendment does not protect obscene\nspeech. E.g., United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 288\n(2008). Under the narrow construction I have proposed,\nthen, the bar on the registration of obscene marks would\nwithstand constitutional challenge. If Congress wished to\nexpand the scope of § 1052(a), it could enact new legisla-\ntion, which could then be constitutionally tested. Without\nthis saving construction, the majority’s result leaves the\ngovernment with no authority to prevent the registration\nof even the most patently obscene marks.\n    Because there is no suggestion that Mr. Brunetti’s\nmark is obscene, however, I agree that the decision of the\nTrademark Trial and Appeal Board must be reversed.\nFor these reasons, I concur in the judgment.\n\n\n\n\n    10  See id. at 1534 (noting that narrowing “immoral”\nand “scandalous” to “obscene” would ensure that the\nprovision no longer applies to marks “at the edges of\nscandalousness”).\n\f",

We hold substantial evi-\ndence supports the Board’s findings and it did not err\nconcluding the mark comprises immoral or scandalous\nmatter. We conclude, however, that § 2(a)’s bar on regis-\ntering immoral or scandalous marks is an unconstitution-\nal restriction of free speech. We therefore reverse the\nBoard’s holding that Mr. Brunetti’s mark is unregistrable.\n                        BACKGROUND\n    I.   Section 2(a)’s Bar on Registration of Immoral or\n                       Scandalous Marks\n     Section 2(a) of the Lanham Act provides that the Pa-\ntent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) may refuse to register\na trademark that “[c]onsists of or comprises immoral,\ndeceptive, or scandalous matter; or matter which may\ndisparage or falsely suggest a connection with persons,\nliving or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or\nbring them into contempt or disrepute . . . .” 15 U.S.C.\n§ 1052(a). While § 2(a) identifies “immoral” and “scandal-\nous” subject matter as separate bases to refuse to register\na trademark—and are provisions separated by the “decep-\ntive” provision—the PTO generally applies the bar on\nimmoral or scandalous marks as a unitary provision (“the\nimmoral or scandalous provision”). See TMEP § 1203.01\n(“Although the words ‘immoral’ and ‘scandalous’ may have\nsomewhat different connotations, case law has included\nimmoral matter in the same category as scandalous\nmatter.”); In re McGinley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 n.6 (CCPA\n1981) (“Because of our holding, infra, that appellant’s\nmark is ‘scandalous,’ it is unnecessary to consider wheth-\ner appellant’s mark is ‘immoral.’ We note the dearth of\nreported trademark decisions in which the term ‘immoral’\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            3\n\n\n\nhas been directly applied.”); see also Anne Gilson LaLonde\n& Jerome Gilson, Trademarks Laid Bare: Marks That\nMay Be Scandalous or Immoral, 101 Trademark Rep.\n1476, 1489 (2011) (“U.S. courts and the Board have not\ndistinguished between ‘immoral’ and ‘scandalous’ and\nhave focused on whether marks are scandalous or offen-\nsive rather than contrary to some accepted standard of\nmorality.” (citation omitted)). The bar on immoral or\nscandalous marks was first codified in 1905, see Act of\nFeb. 20, 1905, ch. 592, § 5(a), 33 Stat. 724, 725, and re-\nenacted in the Lanham Act in 1946, Pub.

Facts of This Case\n    Mr. Brunetti owns the clothing brand “fuct,” which he\nfounded in 1990. In 2011, two individuals filed an intent-\nto-use application (No. 85/310,960) for the mark FUCT for\nvarious items of apparel. The original applicants as-\nsigned the application to Mr. Brunetti, who amended it to\nallege use of the mark. The examining attorney refused\nto register the mark under § 2(a) of the Lanham Act,\nfinding it comprised immoral or scandalous matter. The\nexamining attorney reasoned that FUCT is the past tense\nof the verb “fuck,” a vulgar word, and is therefore scan-\ndalous. J.A. 203.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          5\n\n\n\n    Mr. Brunetti requested reconsideration and appealed\nto the Board. The examining attorney denied reconsider-\nation, and the Board affirmed. In its decision, the Board\nstated the dictionary definitions in the record uniformly\ncharacterize the word “fuck” as offensive, profane, or\nvulgar. The Board noted that the word “fuct” is defined\nby Urban Dictionary as the past tense of the verb “fuck”\nand pronounced the same as the word “fucked,” and\ntherefore found it is “recognized as a slang and literal\nequivalent of the word ‘fucked,’” with “the same vulgar\nmeaning.” J.A. 6–7 & n.6. Based on the examining\nattorney’s Google Images search results, the Board stated\nMr. Brunetti used the mark in the context of “strong, and\noften explicit, sexual imagery that objectifies women and\noffers degrading examples of extreme misogyny,” with a\ntheme “of extreme nihilism—displaying an unending\nsuccession of anti-social imagery of executions, despair,\nviolent and bloody scenes including dismemberment,\nhellacious or apocalyptic events, and dozens of examples\nof other imagery lacking in taste.” J.A. 8–9. The Board\nexplained that Mr. Brunetti’s use of the mark “will be\nperceived by his targeted market segment as the phonetic\nequivalent of the wor[d] ‘fucked.’” J.A. 9. In light of the\nrecord, it found Mr. Brunetti’s assertion that the mark\n“was chosen as an invented or coined term stretches\ncredulity.” Id. It concluded that the mark is vulgar and\ntherefore unregistrable under § 2(a) of the Lanham Act.\nMr. Brunetti appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28\nU.S.C. § 1295(a)(4).\n                       DISCUSSION\n    Mr. Brunetti argues substantial evidence does not\nsupport the Board’s finding the mark FUCT is vulgar\nunder § 2(a) of the Lanham Act. He argues even if the\nmark is vulgar, § 2(a) does not expressly prohibit the\nregistration of vulgar marks and a mark should be ap-\nproved for registration when there is doubt as to its\nmeaning, as he alleges there is here. Alternatively,\n\f6                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nMr. Brunetti challenges the constitutionality of § 2(a)’s\nbar on immoral or scandalous marks.\n    I. The Mark FUCT is Vulgar and Therefore Scandalous\n    The determination that a mark is scandalous is a con-\nclusion of law based upon underlying factual inquiries.\nFox, 702 F.3d at 637. We review the Board’s factual\nfindings for substantial evidence and its ultimate conclu-\nsion de novo. Id. Substantial evidence is “more than a\nmere scintilla” and “such relevant evidence as a reasona-\nble mind might accept as adequate” to support a conclu-\nsion. Consol. Edison v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103099\"><a href=\"/opinion/103099/consolidated-edison-co-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (1938).\n    It is undisputed that the word “fuck” is vulgar. Dic-\ntionaries in the record characterize the word as “taboo,”\n“one of the most offensive” English words, “almost univer-\nsally considered vulgar,” and an “extremely offensive\nexpression.” J.A. 5–6; J.A. 206 (Collins Online Diction-\nary); J.A. 209 (Vocabulary.com); J.A. 211 (Wikipedia.com);\nJ.A. 351 (MacMillan Dictionary). Mr. Brunetti argues\nthat the vulgarity of “fuck” is irrelevant to whether the\nmark FUCT is vulgar. We do not agree.\n    Substantial evidence supports the Board’s finding\nthat “fuct” is a “phonetic twin” of “fucked,” the past tense\nof the word “fuck.” J.A. 10. Urban Dictionary defines\n“fuct” as the “past tense of the verb fuck.” J.A. 83. Mac-\nMillan Dictionary indicates that the word “fucked” is\npronounced phonetically as /fʌkt/, which the Board found\nsounds like “fukt” or “fuct.” J.A. 6 & n.6. This evidence\nlinking the two terms is sufficient to render the vulgarity\nof the word “fuck” relevant to the vulgarity of\nMr. Brunetti’s mark.\n    Evidence of the use of Mr. Brunetti’s mark in the\nmarketplace further buttresses the Board’s finding of a\nlink between the mark and the word “fuck.” The Board\nfound the term “fuct” is used on products containing\nsexual imagery and that consumers perceive the mark as\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           7\n\n\n\nhaving “an unmistakable aura of negative sexual connota-\ntions.” J.A. 9. One T-shirt—captioned the “FUCT Orgy”\nshirt—depicts a group sex scene. J.A. 346. Another T-\nshirt contains the word “FUCK” in yellow letters, with a\n“T” superimposed over the “K” such that the word FUCK\nis still visible. J.A. 325. A third T-shirt has the brand\nname FUCT depicted above the slogan “1970 smokin dope\n& fucking in the streets.” J.A. 312. Because one meaning\nof “fuck” is “to have sex with someone,” the placement of\nthe mark on products containing sexual imagery makes it\nmore likely that the mark will be perceived as the phonet-\nic equivalent of the word “fucked.” J.A. 9.\n    Mr. Brunetti challenges the evidence on which the\nBoard relied in making the vulgarity finding. He argues\nthat Urban Dictionary is not a standard dictionary edited\nby lexicographers and the author of the definition cited by\nthe Board lacks lexicographic expertise. He argues that\nthe Board did not consider his current line of products,\nwhich he provided to the examining attorney, but instead\nrelied on a random collection of outdated products collect-\ned from Google Images. He argues the Board should not\nhave considered these images because they lack founda-\ntion, are inadmissible hearsay, and are irrelevant to the\ncurrent perception of the mark in the marketplace. He\nalso argues that the majority of the marked products\ncontain no sexual imagery.\n    Mr. Brunetti’s arguments have no merit. For ex parte\nproceedings, the Board permits the examining attorney to\nconsider materials from the Internet, having adopted a\n“somewhat more permissive stance with respect to the\nadmissibility and probative value of evidence.” TBMP\n§§ 1208, 1208.03. The pedigree of the author of a defini-\ntion may affect the weight that evidence is given but does\nnot render the definition irrelevant. Similarly, the ages of\nthe images collected by the examining attorney may affect\nevidentiary weight, not relevance.\n\f8                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n    Mr. Brunetti also argues that the Board ignored pro-\nbative evidence that the mark is not vulgar. He argues\nthat both he and the owner of a high-end clothing store\ndeclared that the mark was not vulgar. He argues that\nthe meaning of the term “fuct” is ambiguous, but that to\nthe extent it has any meaning, it is “Friends yoU Can’t\nTrust.” See Mavety, 33 F.3d at 1374 (“commend[ing] the\npractice” of erring on the side of publication when marks\nare not clearly scandalous). He claims that in over twenty\nyears of operation, he received only a single complaint\nabout his brand name and the brand is mass-distributed\nby “high-end national retailers” like Urban Outfitters.\nAppellant’s Br. 8. Finally, he argues that two of Urban\nDictionary’s seven definitions of the term “fuct” refer to\nhis brand name, while only one definition is vulgar.\n    Mr. Brunetti’s proffered evidence does not change our\nconclusion that substantial evidence supports the Board’s\nfindings. The Board explicitly considered Mr. Brunetti’s\ndeclaration and found it “stretche[d] credulity” that “fuct”\nwas chosen as an invented or coined term for “Friends\nyoU Can’t Trust,” given the contradictory record evidence.\nJ.A. 9–10. Mr. Brunetti’s unverifiable claim about the\nnumber of customer complaints may demonstrate that the\nmark is not offensive to a certain segment of the market.\nThat does not satisfy his burden on appeal, however, to\nestablish that the Board lacked substantial evidence for\nits determination that a “substantial composite” of the\nAmerican public would find the mark vulgar. And the\nfact that the Board could have relied on one of the other\nfive definitions of the term “fuct” on Urban Dictionary—a\nwebsite to which anyone can anonymously submit defini-\ntions—does not demonstrate that the Board’s reliance on\nthat website is not substantial evidence. The Board\nreasonably focused on the highest rated definition, sug-\ngesting that it is more common or accurate than the\nalternative, non-vulgar definitions.\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            9\n\n\n\n    Mr. Brunetti argues that even if FUCT is vulgar,\n§ 2(a) does not prohibit the registration of vulgar marks—\nonly “immoral” or “scandalous” marks. He argues that to\nbe immoral or scandalous, a mark must be more than\nmerely vulgar. He argues that extending § 2(a) to vulgar\nmarks is contrary to the plain language of the statute.\n    We do not agree. We have previously held “the PTO\nmay prove scandalousness by establishing that a mark is\n‘vulgar.’” Fox, 702 F.3d at 635; see also Boulevard Entm’t,\n334 F.3d at 1340 (“A showing that a mark is vulgar is\nsufficient to establish that it ‘consists of or comprises\nimmoral . . . or scandalous matter’ within the meaning of\nsection 1052(a).”). We are bound by these holdings.\n     Even if we could overrule our prior holding that a\nshowing of vulgarity is sufficient to establish that a mark\n“consists of or comprises immoral . . . or scandalous mat-\nter,” we see no justification for doing so in light of the\nevidence of record. At the time of the passage of the\nLanham Act, dictionaries defined “scandalous” as “shock-\ning to the sense of truth, decency, or propriety,” “[g]iving\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings,” or “calling out\n[for] condemnation.” McGinley, 660 F.2d at 485–86 (citing\nWebster’s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1942);\nFunk & Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary (1945)).\nOther definitions characterize scandalous as “disgraceful,”\n“offensive,” or “disreputable.” Id. (citing Webster’s New\nInternational Dictionary (2d ed. 1942); Funk & Wagnalls\nNew Standard Dictionary (1945)). We see no definition of\nscandalous that, in light of the PTO’s fact findings, would\nexempt Mr. Brunetti’s mark.\n    We see no merit in Mr. Brunetti’s arguments relating\nto whether the mark is scandalous and therefore prohibit-\ned registration under § 2(a). Substantial evidence sup-\nports the Board’s finding the mark FUCT is vulgar and\ntherefore the Board did not err in concluding the mark is\nnot registrable under § 2(a).\n\f10                                         IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nII. Section 2(a)’s Bar on Immoral or Scandalous Marks is\n      Unconstitutional Under the First Amendment\n    When Mr. Brunetti filed his appeal, his constitutional\nargument was foreclosed by binding precedent.           In\nMcGinley, our predecessor court held the refusal to regis-\nter a mark under § 2(a) does not bar the applicant from\nusing the mark, and therefore does not implicate the First\nAmendment. 660 F.2d at 484. Commentators heavily\ncriticized McGinley and our continued reliance on it,\nparticularly in light of the many changes to First\nAmendment jurisprudence over the last thirty years.

Id.\nat 1334–37, 1358. We held that, although trademarks\nserve a commercial purpose as source identifiers in the\nmarketplace, the disparagement provision of § 2(a) relat-\ned to the expressive character of marks, not their com-\nmercial purpose.

Tam, 808 F.3d\nat 1355–58.\n    The en banc court noted that § 2(a) contains a hodge-\npodge of differing prohibitions on registration, and as\nsuch, the holding in Tam was limited to § 2(a)’s dispar-\nagement provision.

Id. at 1757–61.\n\f12                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nPursuant to two opinions authored by Justice Alito and\nJustice Kennedy, it concluded that § 2(a)’s bar on the\nregistration of disparaging marks discriminated based on\nviewpoint. Id. at 1763 (Alito, J.); id. at 1765 (Kennedy,\nJ.). The Court explained the disparagement provision\n“offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech\nmay not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas\nthat offend.” Id. at 1751 (Alito, J.); accord id. at 1766\n(Kennedy, J.). The plurality opinion, authored by Justice\nAlito and joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas,\nand Justice Breyer, further concluded that the constitu-\ntionality of the disparagement provision could not be\nsustained by analyzing trademark registration as either a\nfederal subsidy or a federal program. Id. at 1760–63\n(Alito, J.). The remaining four participating Justices\nopined, in a concurring opinion authored by Justice Ken-\nnedy, that “the viewpoint discrimination rationale renders\nunnecessary any extended treatment of other questions\nraised by the parties.” Id. at 1765 (Kennedy, J.).\n   Both opinions held the disparagement provision un-\nconstitutionally restricted free speech, left open was “the\nquestion of whether Central Hudson provides the appro-\npriate test for deciding free speech challenges to provi-\nsions of the Lanham Act.” Id. at 1764 n.17 (Alito, J.); see\nalso id. at 1767 (Kennedy, J.). Justice Alito’s opinion\nconcluded the disparagement provision failed even the\nintermediate test under Central Hudson because the\nprohibition was not narrowly drawn to a substantial\ngovernment interest. Id. at 1764–65 (Alito, J.). Justice\nKennedy’s opinion concluded that, because the dispar-\nagement provision discriminates based on viewpoint, it\nwas subject to heightened scrutiny, which it did not\nwithstand. Id. at 1767–68 (Kennedy, J.). Neither opinion\nreached the constitutionality of other provisions of § 2 of\nthe Lanham Act. See, e.g., id. at 1768 (Kennedy, J.).\n   Following the issuance of the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Tam, we requested additional briefing from the parties\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          13\n\n\n\nregarding the impact of the Supreme Court’s decision on\nMr. Brunetti’s case. In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket\nNo. 58 (Fed. Cir. June 20, 2017). Both parties submitted\nletter briefs and we heard oral argument on August 29,\n2017. The government contends Tam does not resolve the\nconstitutionality of § 2(a)’s bar on registering immoral or\nscandalous marks because the disparagement provision\nimplicates viewpoint discrimination, whereas the immoral\nor scandalous provision is viewpoint neutral. Gov’t Letter\nBr. 6–9, In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket No. 60 (Fed.\nCir.

Ct.\nat 1761 (Alito, J.).\n    Trademark registration does not implicate Congress’\npower to spend funds. An applicant does not receive\nfederal funds upon the PTO’s consideration of, or grant of,\na trademark. The only exchange of funds flows from the\napplicant to the PTO. The applicant pays the applicable\ntrademark process and service fees set forth in 37 C.F.R.\n§ 2.6(a)(1), which are then made “available to the Director\nto carry out the activities of the [PTO].” 35 U.S.C.\n§ 42(c)(1). As explained in our en banc opinion in Tam,\nsince 1991, trademark registration fees—not appropria-\ntions from taxpayers—have entirely funded the direct\noperating expenses associated with trademark registra-\ntion. 808 F.3d at 1353 (citing, e.g., Figueroa v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1023</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 2006)). Congress’\nauthority to direct funds is thus not implicated by either\nthe operating expenses necessary to examine a proposed\nmark or the PTO’s ultimate grant of trademark registra-\ntion. Of course, trademark registration does not persist\nentirely independent of federal funds. The government\n\f18                                            IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nmust expend certain federal funds, including but not\nlimited to the cost of PTO employee benefits and costs\nassociated with trademark enforcement, in connection\nwith trademark registration. See id. (citing Figueroa, 466\nF.3d at 1028). But to the extent government resources\nare tangentially involved with trademark registration,\n“just about every government service requires the ex-\npenditure of government funds.” Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1761\n(listing, for example, police and fire protection, and copy-\nright and motor vehicle registrations) (Alito, J.); Tam,\n808 F.3d at 1353 (“Trademark registration does not\nimplicate the Spending Clause merely because of this\nattenuated spending, else every benefit or regulatory\nprogram provided by the government would implicate the\nSpending Clause.”). The government’s involvement in\nprocessing and issuing trademarks does not transform\ntrademark registration into a government subsidy.\n   Nor is the grant of trademark registration a subsidy\nequivalent. “Registration is significant.

See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 830. In Rosen-\nberger, the Supreme Court considered a University’s\ndistribution of funds through a Student Activities Fund\n(“SAF”) intended to “support a broad range of extracurric-\nular student activities that ‘are related to the educational\npurpose of the University.’” Id. at 824. The Court con-\ncluded the SAF was a limited public forum that “effects a\nsweeping restriction on student thought and student\ninquiry in the context of University sponsored publica-\ntions.” Id. at 829–30, 836. Although the SAF was “meta-\nphysical”—in that it concerned use of the University’s\nfunds rather than the University’s facilities, id. at 830—\nthe effect of its restrictions on speech were felt on the\ngovernment’s property, the University. See id. at 836\n(explaining the SAF “risks the suppression of free speech\nand creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the\nNation’s intellectual life, its college and university cam-\npuses”). The forum at issue in Cornelius likewise involved\na more abstract forum—a charity drive—but that drive\nwas “conducted in the federal workplace during working\nhours.” 473 U.S. at 790.

The speech\nthat flows from trademark registration is not tethered to\na public school, federal workplace, or any other govern-\nment property. A principal feature of trademarks is that\nthey help “consumers identify goods and services that\nthey wish to purchase, as well as those they want to\navoid.” Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1751. “These marks make up\npart of the expression of everyday life, as with the names\nof entertainment groups, broadcast networks, designer\nclothing, newspapers, automobiles, candy bars, toys, and\nso on.” Id. at 1768 (Kennedy, J.). By their very purpose,\ntrademarks exist to convey messages throughout com-\nmerce. It is difficult to analogize the Nike swoosh or the\nNike JUST DO IT mark located on a Nike shirt in a Nike\nstore as somehow a government created limited public\nforum. The registration and use of registered trademarks\nsimply does not fit within the rubric of public or limited\npublic forum cases. “[T]he forum analysis requires con-\nsideration not only of whether government property has\nbeen opened to the public, but also of the nature and\npurpose of the property at issue.” Preminger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (internal citations omitted); see also Cornelius, 473\nU.S. at 805 (examining the nature of the government\nproperty involved).\n    A snapshot of marks recently rejected under the im-\nmoral or scandalous provision reveals the breadth of\ngoods and services impacted by § 2(a)’s bar on such\nmarks, including speech occurring on clothing, books,\nwebsites, beverages, mechanical contraptions, and live\nentertainment. These refusals chill speech anywhere\nfrom the Internet to the grocery store. And none of them\ninvolve government property over which the government\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           25\n\n\n\ncan assert a right to “legally preserve the property under\nits control for the use to which it is dedicated.” Lamb’s\nChapel, 508 U.S. at 390.\n    That registered marks also appear on the govern-\nment’s principal register does not transform trademark\nregistration into a limited public forum. The government\ndoes not open the principal register to any exchange of\nideas—it is ancillary to trademark registration. The\nprincipal register is simply a database identifying the\nmarks approved for use in commerce. Oral Arg. at 29:28–\n41. Apart from its function as a database, the govern-\nment has been unable to define exactly what the principal\nregister is, or where it is located. Id. at 29:34–54. If the\ngovernment can constitutionally restrain the expression\nof private speech in commerce because such speech is\nidentified in a government database, so too could the\ngovernment restrain speech occurring on private land or\nin connection with privately-owned vehicles, simply\nbecause those private properties are listed in a database.\nCf. Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1760 (“For if the registration of\ntrademarks constituted government speech, other sys-\ntems of government registration could easily be character-\nized in the same way.”). As the government recognized,\nsuch a suppression of speech would raise serious concerns\nunder the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. See Oral\nArg. at 29:56–30:34 (“[T]he key difference there is the\napplication of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine,\nwhich is the significant constraint on the government’s\nability to abuse its power over something like a land\nregistry to influence speech outside a program.”). The\ngovernment fails to articulate a reason why the govern-\nment’s listing of registered trademarks in a database\ncreates a limited public forum. And if it did then every\ngovernment registration program including titles to land,\nregistration of cars, registration of wills or estates, copy-\nrights, even marriage licenses could similarly implicate a\nlimited public forum. We thus conclude that government\n\f26                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nregistration of trademarks does not create a limited public\nforum in which the government can more freely restrict\nspeech.\n  3.The Prohibition on the Registration of Immoral or\nScandalous Trademarks Targets the Expressive Content\n   of Speech and Therefore Strict Scrutiny Should Be\n                        Applied\n   Commercial speech is speech which does “no more\nthan propose a commercial transaction.” Va. State Bd. of\nPharmacy v. Va. Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109450\"><a href=\"/opinion/109450/va-pharmacy-bd-v-va-consumer-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 762 (1976) (citation omitted). Trademarks\ncertainly convey a commercial message, but not exclusive-\nly so. There is no doubt that trademarks “identify the\nsource of a product or service, and therefore play a role in\nthe ‘dissemination of information as to who is producing\nand selling what product, for what reason, and at what\nprice.’” Tam, 808 F.3d at 1338 (quoting Va. State Bd. of\nPharmacy, 425 U.S. at 765). However, trademarks—\nincluding immoral or scandalous trademarks—also “often\nhave an expressive content.” Tam, 137 S. Ct. at 1760.\nFor immoral or scandalous marks, this message is often\nuncouth. But it can espouse a powerful cause. See, e.g.,\nFUCK HEROIN, Appl. No. 86,361,326; FUCK CANCER,\nAppl.     No. 86,290,011;     FUCK      RACISM,       Appl.\nNo. 85,608,559. It can put forth a political view, see\nDEMOCRAT.BS,            Appl.      No. 77,042,069,        or\nREPUBLICAN.BS, Appl. No. 77,042,071.            While the\nspeech expressed in trademarks is brief, “powerful mes-\nsages can sometimes be conveyed in just a few words.”\nTam, 137 S. Ct. at 1760.\n   The test used by the PTO to prohibit immoral or scan-\ndalous marks is whether a “substantial composite of the\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           27\n\n\n\ngeneral public” 3 would find the mark “shocking to the\nsense of truth, decency, or propriety; disgraceful; offen-\nsive; disreputable; . . . giving offense to the conscience or\nmoral feelings; . . . or calling out for condemnation.” Fox,\n702 F.3d at 665. There can be no question that the im-\nmoral or scandalous prohibition targets the expressive\ncomponents of the speech. As in this case, the agency\noften justifies its rejection of marks on the grounds that\nthey convey offensive ideas. J.A. 8–9 (explaining that Mr.\nBrunetti’s use of his trademark is scandalous because his\nmark “objectifies women and offers degrading examples of\nextreme misogyny” and contains a theme “of extreme\nnihilism” with “anti-social imagery” and is “lacking in\ntaste”). These are each value judgments about the ex-\npressive message behind the trademark. Whether marks\ncomprise immoral or scandalous subject matter hinges on\nthe expressive, not source-identifying, nature of trade-\nmarks.\n   While different provisions of the Lanham Act may ap-\npropriately be classified as targeting a mark’s source-\nidentifying information—for example, § 2(e)’s bar on\nregistering marks that are “merely descriptive” or “geo-\ngraphically descriptive”—the immoral or scandalous\nprovision targets a mark’s expressive message, which is\nseparate and distinct from the commercial purpose of a\nmark as a source identifier. Justice Kennedy explained in\nhis concurrence: “The central purpose of trademark\nregistration is to facilitate source identification. . . .\nWhether a mark is disparaging bears no plausible rela-\ntion to that goal.” 137 S. Ct. at 1768 (Kennedy, J.). We\nfind the same logic applies to the immoral or scandalous\n\n\n\n    3   The PTO justifies its refusals by “tying censorship\nto the reaction of the speaker’s audience.” See Tam, 137\nS. Ct. at 1766 (Kennedy, J.).\n\f28                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nprohibition. As in the case of disparaging marks, the\nPTO’s rejections under § 2(a)’s bar on immoral or scandal-\nous marks are necessarily based in the government’s\nbelief that the rejected mark conveys an expressive mes-\nsage—namely, a message that is scandalous or offensive\nto a substantial composite of the general population. See\nTam, 808 F.3d at 1338. Section 2(a) regulates the expres-\nsive components of speech, not the commercial compo-\nnents of speech, and as such it should be subject to strict\nscrutiny. See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219616\"><a href=\"/opinion/219616/sorrell-v-ims-health-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (2011). There is no dispute that § 2(a)’s bar on\nthe registration of immoral or scandalous marks is uncon-\nstitutional if strict scrutiny applies.\n     4. Section 2(a)’s Bar on Immoral or Scandalous Marks\n            Does Not Survive Intermediate Scrutiny\n    Section 2(a)’s bar on the registration of immoral or\nscandalous marks is unconstitutional even if treated as a\nregulation of purely commercial speech reviewed accord-\ning to the intermediate scrutiny framework established in\nCentral Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566. Intermediate scrutiny\nrequires that “the State must show at least that the\nstatute directly advances a substantial governmental\ninterest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that\ninterest.” Sorrell, 564 U.S. at 572.\n    Commercial speech is subject to a four-part test which\nasks whether (1) the speech concerns lawful activity and\nis not misleading; (2) the asserted government interest is\nsubstantial; (3) the regulation directly advances that\ngovernment interest; and (4) whether the regulation is\n“not more extensive than necessary to serve that inter-\nest.” Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 566; see also Bd. of Tr.\nof State Univ. of N.Y. v.

Section 2(a)’s provi-\nsion barring immoral or scandalous marks, like the dis-\nparagement provision, does not address misleading,\ndeceptive, or unlawful marks. Rather it is concerned with\nwhether a mark is offensive, scandalous, or vulgar to a\nsubstantial composite of the general public.\n    Central Hudson’s second prong, requiring a substan-\ntial government interest, is not met. The only govern-\nment interest related to the immoral or scandalous\nprovision that we can discern from the government’s\nbriefing is its interest in “protecting public order and\nmorality.” Gov’t Letter Br. 15 & n.6, In re Brunetti,\nNo. 15-1109, Docket No. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017). 4 At\noral argument, the government struggled to identify the\nsubstantial interest in barring registration of trademarks\ncomprising immoral or scandalous subject matter. The\ngovernment framed its interest based on the government’s\nown perception of proposed marks, including what types\nof marks the government would “want to promote” or “has\ndeemed to be most suitable.” Oral Arg. at 22:35–41,\n\n\n   4    The government’s brief also made an errant refer-\nence to its interest “in the orderly flow of commerce.”\nGov’t Letter Br. 15, In re Brunetti, No. 15-1109, Docket\nNo. 60 (Fed. Cir. July 20, 2017). While we do not question\nthe substantiality of this interest, the government has\nfailed to articulate how this interest is in any way ad-\nvanced by the immoral or scandalous prohibition, or how\nthat provision is narrowly tailored to that interest.\n\f30                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n22:56–23:00. At another point, the government indicated\nits interest is to shield its examiners from immoral or\nscandalous marks: “whether or not its examiners are\nforced to decide whether one drawing of genitalia is\nconfusingly similar to another drawing of genitalia.” Id.\nat 21:51–22:12.     Ultimately, the government stated,\n“Congress’ primary interest is the promotion of the use of\nnon-scandalous marks in commerce.” Id. at 23:33–42; see\nalso id. at 25:21–32 (“Promoting commerce that doesn’t\ninclude the use of source identifiers that are graphic\nsexual images or profanities that are going to be off-\nputting to a substantial composite of the public.”).\nWhichever articulation of the government’s interest we\nchoose, the government has failed to identify a substan-\ntial interest justifying its suppression of immoral or\nscandalous trademarks. 5\n    First, the government does not have a substantial in-\nterest in promoting certain trademarks over others. The\nSupreme Court rejected the government’s claim that\ntrademarks are government speech. Tam, 137 S. Ct.\nat 1757–61. Our conclusion that trademark registration\nis neither a government subsidy nor a limited public\nforum forecloses any remaining interest the government\nmay have in approving only marks it “has deemed to be\nmost suitable.” Oral Arg. at 22:56–23:00; see also Tam,\n\n\n\n     5  We note that the government hardly met its bur-\nden to identify a government interest at all. To identify\nthis purported interest, the government has done no more\nthan “taken the effect of the statute and posited that effect\nas the State’s interest. If accepted, this sort of circular\ndefense can sidestep judicial review of almost any statute,\nbecause it makes all statutes look narrowly tailored.”\nSimon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y.

The government’s interest in\nsuppressing speech because it is off-putting is unavailing.\n    While the government’s interest in Tam related to a\nviewpoint-based restriction on speech, we note the cases\non which the Supreme Court relied are not so limited.\nThe cases cited in Tam are directed to speech that may be\noffensive, but not all involve speech that is disparaging or\nviewpoint discriminatory.

Several\nother cases do not appear to involve viewpoint discrimina-\ntion at all. For example, Hustler Magazine concerned a\nparody interview of Jerry Falwell in which the actor\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                            33\n\n\n\nplaying him stated his “‘first time’ was during a drunken\nincestuous rendezvous with his mother in an outhouse.”\n485 U.S. at 48. While such a parody interview is offen-\nsive, its function as a parody does not clearly involve the\nexpression of beliefs, ideas, or perspectives. Similarly, the\nordinance at issue in Coates was not limited to restricting\ndisparaging speech or certain viewpoints, but prohibited\nany conduct perceived as “annoying to persons passing\nby.” 402 U.S. at 611. The Supreme Court’s narrative that\nthe government cannot justify restricting speech because\nit offends, together with its reliance on cases involving a\nvariety of different speech restrictions, reinforce our\nconclusion that the government’s interest in protecting\nthe public from off-putting marks is not substantial.\n    Finally, the government does not have a substantial\ninterest in protecting the public from scandalousness and\nprofanities. The government attempts to justify this\ninterest by pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in\nFCC v. Pacifica Foundation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109939\"><a href=\"/opinion/109939/fcc-v-pacifica-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">726</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978). In\nPacifica, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality\nof the FCC’s declaratory order determining that an after-\nnoon radio broadcast of George Carlin’s “Filthy Words”\nmonologue was indecent and potentially sanctionable. Id.\nat 730–32. The Court explained “references to excretory\nand sexual material . . . surely lie at the periphery of First\nAmendment concern.” Id. at 742. The Court justified the\nFCC’s order, however, because radio broadcasting has “a\nuniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all Americans”\nand is “uniquely accessible to children, even those too\nyoung to read,” confronting Americans “in the privacy of\nthe home, where the individual’s right to be left alone\nplainly outweighs the First Amendment rights of an\nintruder.” Id. at 749. The Court stressed: “It is appropri-\nate to emphasize the narrowness of our holding.” Id. at\n750. Subsequent precedent explained that other mediums\nof communication, such as dial-in-services or the Internet,\nare “manifestly different from a situation in which a\n\f34                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nlistener does not want the received message.” Sable\nCommc’ns of Cal., Inc. v.

A trademark is not foisted upon\nlisteners by virtue of its being registered. Nor does regis-\ntration make a scandalous mark more accessible to chil-\ndren. Absent any concerns that trademark registration\ninvades a substantial privacy interest in an intolerable\nmanner, the government’s interest amounts to protecting\neveryone, including adults, from scandalous content. But\neven when “many adults themselves would find the\nmaterial highly offensive,” adults have a First Amend-\nment right to view and hear speech that is profane and\nscandalous. Playboy, 529 U.S. at 811 (First Amendment\nright to view “sexually explicit adult programming or\nother programming that is indecent”); Sable, 492 U.S.\nat 115 (“Sexual expression which is indecent but not\nobscene is protected by the First Amendment.”). In\ncrafting a substantial government interest, “the govern-\nment may not ‘reduce the adult population . . . to . . . only\nwhat is fit for children.’” Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73 (citation\nomitted); cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 131 (“[T]he statute’s denial\nof adult access to telephone messages which are indecent\nbut not obscene far exceeds that which is necessary to\nlimit the access of minors to such messages . . . .”).\n   Even if we were to hold that the government has a\nsubstantial interest in protecting the public from scandal-\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                           35\n\n\n\nous or immoral marks, the government could not meet the\nthird prong of Central Hudson, which requires the regula-\ntion directly advance the government’s asserted interest.\n447 U.S. at 566. As the government has repeatedly\nexhorted, § 2(a) does not directly prevent applicants from\nusing their marks. Regardless of whether a trademark is\nfederally registered, an applicant can still brand clothing\nwith his mark, advertise with it on the television or radio,\nor place it on billboards along the highway. In this elec-\ntronic/Internet age, to the extent that the government\nseeks to protect the general population from scandalous\nmaterial, with all due respect, it has completely failed.\n    Finally, no matter the government’s interest, it cannot\nmeet the fourth prong of Central Hudson. The PTO’s\ninconsistent application of the immoral or scandalous\nprovision creates an “uncertainty [that] undermines the\nlikelihood that the [provision] has been carefully tailored.”\nSee Reno, 521 U.S. at 871. Nearly identical marks have\nbeen approved by one examining attorney and rejected as\nscandalous or immoral by another. The PTO registered\nthe mark FUGLY for use on clothing, but refused regis-\ntration for use on alcoholic beverages. Compare Reg.\nNo. 5,135,615, with Appl. No. 78,866,347.          See also\nCOCAINE, Appl. No. 78,829,207 (rejected), COCAINE,\nReg. No. 1,340,874 (accepted). The PTO registered NO\nBS! BRASS, Reg. No. Reg.

Although the language in\nthese marks is offensive, we cannot discern any pattern\nindicating when the incorporation of an offensive term\ninto a mark will serve as a bar to registration and when it\nwill not.\n\f36                                           IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n    One commentator has written that, of the forty marks\ncontaining the acronym MILF for which written records\nwere available as of 2011, twenty marks received an office\naction refusing registration based on § 2(a), while twenty\ndid not. Anne Gilson LaLonde & Jerome Gilson, Trade-\nmarks Laid Bare: Marks That May Be Scandalous or\nImmoral, 101 Trademark Rep. 1476, 1478–82 (2011). It is\ndifficult to understand what distinguished the refused\nmarks, which included GOT MILF (clothing), MILF\nMANIA (adult online services), MILF SEEKER (adult\nentertainment services), and FROM SOCCER MOM TO\nMILF (self-help books for women), from the marks which\nwere registered, including DIARY OF A MILF (adult\nonline services), BACKROOM MILF (adult online ser-\nvices), FAT MILF (sandwich), and MILF NEXT DOOR\n(adult online services). Id. Another empirical study\nidentified words that served as the basis of a § 2(a) refusal\nin some marks but were material components of other\nmarks approved by the PTO. The authors found that to\nthe extent there are general trends in the PTO’s treat-\nment of the offensive terms, “those general trends are\napparently inconsistent with one another.” Meghan M.\nCarpenter & Mary Garner, NSFW: An Empirical Study of\nScandalous Trademarks, 33 Cardozo Arts & Ent. L.J. 321,\n356–61 (2015). Even marks that reference the indisputa-\nbly vulgar term “fuck,” like the mark at issue here, are\nnot always rejected as a matter of course. The PTO\nregistered the mark FCUK, but rejected the marks FUCT\nand F**K PROJECT as scandalous. It allowed the regis-\ntration of MUTHA EFFIN BINGO, Reg.

In re In Over Our Heads, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">354546</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nat *1 (“[T]he guidelines for determining whether a mark\nis scandalous or disparaging are somewhat vague and the\ndetermination of whether a mark is scandalous or dispar-\naging is necessarily a highly subjective one.”). It can no\ndoubt be a difficult task to determine public perceptions of\na trademark’s morality or immorality, offensiveness, or\neven vulgarity. As the Supreme Court has explained, “it\nis largely because governmental officials cannot make\nprincipled distinctions in this area that the Constitution\nleaves matters of taste and style so largely to the individ-\nual.” Cohen, 403 U.S. at 25. To be sure, there are other\ntrademark’s whose offensiveness cannot be reasonably\nquestioned; the government attached an appendix with\nexamples of such marks which it has rejected to this\ncourt. But the subjectivity in the determination of what is\nimmoral or scandalous and the disparate and unpredicta-\nble application of these principles cause us to conclude\nthat the prohibition at issue in this case would also fail\nthe fourth prong of the Central Hudson analysis.\n   We conclude that the government has not presented us\nwith a substantial government interest justifying the\n§ 2(a) bar on immoral or scandalous marks. As we con-\n\n\n\nmoral or scandalous provision also raise concerns about\nthe provision’s vagueness. See Tam, 808 F.3d at 1359\n(O’Malley, J., concurring) (opining that § 2(a)’s bar on\ndisparaging marks was unconstitutionally vague and\nidentifying examples “where there is no conceivable\ndifference between the applied-for marks, yet one is\napproved and the other rejected”). We need not reach\nwhether the immoral or scandalous provision is so vague\nthat it violates the Fifth Amendment.\n\f38                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\ncluded in Tam, “All of the government’s proffered inter-\nests boil down to permitting the government to burden\nspeech it finds offensive.” Tam, 808 F.3d at 1357. We\nalso conclude that the government has failed to demon-\nstrate that its restriction will advance the interests it\nasserts and that it is narrowly tailored to achieve that\nobjective. Section 2(a)’s bar on immoral or scandalous\nmarks does not survive intermediate scrutiny under\nCentral Hudson.\n  5. There Is No Reasonable Definition of the Statutory\n Terms Scandalous and Immoral Which Would Preserve\n                 Their Constitutionality\n    We construe statutes narrowly to preserve their con-\nstitutionality, when possible.

However, “[t]he infringement of\nFirst Amendment rights will not be cured if the narrow-\ning construction is so unforeseeable that men of common\nintelligence could not have realized the law’s limited\nscope at the only relevant time, when their acts were\ncommitted, or if the law remains excessively sweeping\neven as narrowed.” Gregory v.

It is thus permissible to\nconstrue a statute in a manner that preserves its consti-\ntutionality only where the construction is reasonable.\n\n   The concurrence agrees that the scandalous and im-\nmoral prohibitions as construed by the government, this\ncourt, and our predecessor court are unconstitutional.\nThis court and its predecessor have consistently defined\n“scandalous” as “shocking to the sense of truth, decency,\nor propriety; disgraceful; offensive; disreputable; giving\n\fIN RE: BRUNETTI                                          39\n\n\n\noffense to the conscience or moral feelings; or calling out\nfor condemnation.” Fox, 702 F.3d at 635; accord McGin-\nley, 660 F.2d at 485; Riverbank Canning Co., 95 F.3d at\n328. The concurrence proposes that we “narrow the\nimmoral-scandalous provision’s scope to obscene marks in\norder to preserve its constitutionality.” Conc. Op. 5–6.\nWhile the legislature could rewrite the statute to adopt\nsuch a standard, we cannot.\n    It is not reasonable to construe the words immoral\nand scandalous as confined to obscene material. There is\nno dispute that an obscene mark would be scandalous or\nimmoral; however, not all scandalous or immoral marks\nare obscene. All apples are fruit, but not all fruits are\napples. As the PTO has explained, “the threshold for\nobjectionable matter is lower for what can be described as\n‘scandalous’ than for ‘obscene.’” J.A. 4 (citation omitted);\naccord McGinley, 660 F.2d at 487 n.9. The PTO has for a\ncentury rejected marks as scandalous or immoral that are\nclearly not obscene. As set forth above, many of the early\ncases applying the immoral or scandalous provision\ninvolved blasphemous marks touching on religion, which\nwere not obscene. 7\n\n\n\n   7    With no authority, the concurrence suggests “the\ncentral aim of the immoral-scandalous provision . . . has\nbeen sexual material.” Conc. Op. 6–7. To the contrary,\nthere is a long history of rejecting numerous categories of\nnon-sexual material under this provision. See generally\nLaLonde & Gilson, supra, at 1510–14, 1517–33 (discuss-\ning the application of the provision to marks related to\nreligion, drug references, violence, disparaging patriotic\nsymbols, mild profanity, and scatological references).\nMoreover, the concurrence suggests narrowing the im-\nmoral or scandalous provision to obscene material would\n\f40                                          IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\n    The Supreme Court has made clear that the definition\nof obscenity for purposes of the First Amendment is\n“material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to\nprurient interest,” i.e., “material having a tendency to\nexcite lustful thoughts.” Roth v.

We cannot stand in the shoes of the legis-\nlature and rewrite a statute.\n                       CONCLUSION\n   The trademark at issue is vulgar. And the govern-\nment included an appendix in its briefing to the court\nwhich contains numerous highly offensive, even shocking,\nimages and words for which individuals have sought\ntrademark registration. Many of the marks rejected\nunder § 2(a)’s bar on immoral or scandalous marks,\nincluding the marks discussed in this opinion, are lewd,\ncrass, or even disturbing. We find the use of such marks\nin commerce discomforting, and are not eager to see a\n\f42                                         IN RE: BRUNETTI\n\n\n\n\nproliferation of such marks in the marketplace. There\nare, however, a cadre of similarly offensive images and\nwords that have secured copyright registration by the\ngovernment. There are countless songs with vulgar lyrics,\nblasphemous images, scandalous books and paintings, all\nof which are protected under federal law. No doubt many\nworks registered with the Copyright Office offend a sub-\nstantial composite of the general public. There are words\nand images that we do not wish to be confronted with, not\nas art, nor in the marketplace.

In\n1896, the Supreme Court considered an early version of\nthese laws, which criminalized the mailing of “obscene,\nlewd or lascivious” materials. Swearingen v.

While acknowledging\nthat “it might be inferred that each of those epithets\npointed out a distinct offense”—the familiar canon against\nsuperfluities—the Court nevertheless construed the\nstatute narrowly to “describ[e] one and the same offense,”\nnamely, the mailing of obscene materials. Id.\n    The obscenity statutes were later amended to include\nan even broader description of the targeted matter.\nToday, 18 U.S.C. § 1461 criminalizes the mailing of any\n“obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article,”\nand § 1462 criminalizes the importation of “obscene, lewd,\nlascivious, or filthy” materials. Nonetheless, in a series of\nopinions in the 1960s and ’70s, the Supreme Court con-\nstrued this broader language narrowly to apply only to\nobscenity in order to avoid constitutional doubts.

In addi-\ntion, all three words were defined in terms of giving\noffense to morals, and “obscene” and “immoral” were\nspecifically defined in opposition to chastity.

Maj.\nOp. 38. But the majority provides no plausible reason for\nfailure to narrowly construe the language in § 1052(a) to\navoid the evident problems created by a broader construc-\ntion. To be sure, as the majority points out, the words\n“immoral” and “scandalous” could have a broader mean-\ning than “obscenity,” a broader meaning fraught with\nconstitutional problems. But the potential breadth of the\nlanguage is hardly a reason to reject a narrowing con-\nstruction; rather, it is the very reason that a narrowing\nconstruction is appropriate. And the majority offers no\nconvincing basis for distinguishing this case from the\nSupreme Court cases, discussed above, narrowing the\nconstruction of very similar language to obscenity. The\nmajority appears to suggest that in those Supreme Court\ncases, the statutory concern with sexual representations\nwas evident but that here that connection is absent. In\nfact, the central aim of the immoral-scandalous provision\nin this court’s cases has been sexual material reflected in\n\n\n\n\n    6   We are under this obligation notwithstanding the\nfact that the government has not advocated for such a\nnarrowing construction.
