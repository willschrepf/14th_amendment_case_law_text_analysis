A jury found appellant Katy Springs & Manufacturing, Inc. liable\nfor negligence and awarded appellee Joseph Favalora $779,627.02 in\ncompensatory damages. Katy Springs appeals the judgment in eight main issues\nand a number of sub-issues. We modify the trial court’s judgment to delete the\n$100,000 award for future mental anguish and affirm the judgment as modified.\n\fI.    SUMMARY FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      On October 5, 2010, Favalora was working by himself on a manufacturing\nline producing industrial springs at Katy Springs’ facility in Katy, Texas. During\nhis shift, a bundle of large-gauge wire used to make the springs jammed in a pay-\noff reel that was fabricated by employees at Katy Springs. As Favalora bent down\nto free the jammed wire, the wire began to escape through a three-inch gap at the\ntop of the reel. The escaping wire hit Favalora in the chest, causing him to fall.\nFavalora started to feel pain in his chest and neck. He went to an urgent care\nfacility and was later transferred to Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital where a\ndoctor diagnosed him with a chest contusion, neck sprain, and cervical\nradiculopathy. Following the October 5, 2010 accident, Favalora endured long-\nterm chronic neck pain and numbness in his arm. In 2012, he relocated to\nLouisiana and began consulting with Dr. Bradley Bartholomew, a neurosurgeon.\nEventually, after exhausting conservative pain treatments, including epidural\nsteroid injections and     prescription   pain   medications,   Dr. Bartholomew\nrecommended spinal surgery. In March 2013, Favalora had the surgery, which\nfused his C3-4 and C5-6 vertebrae.\n\n      Favalora sued Katy Springs for negligence. The case went to trial, and the\njury returned a verdict in favor of Favalora. The jury awarded Favalora\n$204,627.02 for past medical expenses; $25,000 for lost earning capacity in the\npast; $81,000 in past physical pain and suffering; $100,000 for future physical pain\nand suffering; $19,000 for past physical impairment; $100,000 for future physical\nimpairment; $150,000 for past mental anguish; and $100,000 for future mental\nanguish. The judgment was signed on December 16, 2013. Katy Springs filed a\nmotion for new trial, which was denied by the trial court in an order dated\nFebruary 24, 2014. Katy Springs timely appealed. Katy Springs appeals the\n\n                                          2\n\fjudgment in eight main issues and a number of sub-issues, which we summarize\nhere:\n\n        1. The evidence is legally and factually insufficient to sustain the\n           jury’s finding on negligence.\n        2. The evidence shows that Favalora was the sole cause of his\n           injuries.\n        3. The evidence is (1) legally insufficient to sustain the jury’s award\n           for past medical expenses; (2) legally insufficient to sustain the\n           jury’s awards for past and future mental anguish; and (3) legally\n           and factually insufficient to sustain the jury’s awards for past and\n           future physical impairment.\n        4. The trial court erred in admitting evidence of Favalora’s damages\n           because (1) the admission of the full amounts of Favalora’s\n           medical bills rather than the amounts received by the providers\n           from a third party violated Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n           section 41.0105; (2) the affidavits do not comply with Civil\n           Practice and Remedies Code section 18.001; and (3) the trial court\n           should have allowed additional pretrial discovery on the damage\n           amounts. Katy Springs further contends (4) the trial court allowed\n           Favalora to submit duplicative evidence of medical bills; and (5)\n           the trial court erred in striking Katy Springs’ counter-affidavit.\n        5. Favalora’s counsel engaged in improper jury argument that was\n           incurable.\n        6. The trial court erred in excluding evidence of Favalora’s prior\n           illegal drug use.\n        7. The jury charge was “fraught with errors of inclusion and\n           exclusion.”\n        8. The trial court erred in denying Katy Springs’ motion to reopen\n           evidence and motion for new trial.\nWe consider each issue and the related sub-issues in turn.\n\nII.     SUFFICIENCY    OF THE     EVIDENCE     TO   SUPPORT JURY’S FINDING         OF\n        NEGLIGENCE\n        In its first issue Katy Springs contends the evidence is legally and factually\n\n\n                                           3\n\finsufficient to support the jury’s finding of negligence. Katy Springs specifically\nchallenges the jury’s findings on the duty, breach, and causation elements.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n      When an appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence on a\nmatter for which he did not have the burden of proof, he must demonstrate on\nappeal that there is no evidence to support the adverse findings. Croucher v.\nCroucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983); McCullough v. Scarbrough, Medlin &\nAssocs., Inc., 435 S.W.3d 871, 892 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied). Under a\nno-evidence point, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nverdict, indulging every reasonable inference in support. City of Keller v. Wilson,\n168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005). We are mindful in our review that jurors are the\nsole judges of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their\ntestimony. Id. at 819. A legal sufficiency challenge fails if there is more than a\nscintilla of evidence to support the judgment. BMC Software Belg., N.V. v.\nMarchand, 83 S.W.3d 789, 795 (Tex. 2002). “The final test for legal sufficiency\nmust always be whether the evidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-\nminded people to reach the verdict under review.” City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at\n827. Evidence that does no more than create a surmise or suspicion is insufficient\nto rise to the level of a scintilla and, in legal effect, is no evidence. Ford Motor Co.\nv. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 601 (Tex. 2004).\n\n      When we evaluate a factual sufficiency challenge, we must consider and\nweigh all the evidence; we can set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak or\nif the finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence that\nit is clearly wrong and unjust. Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242\n(Tex. 2001) (per curiam). If we affirm a challenged jury verdict as being supported\nby factually sufficient evidence, we need not detail all the evidence in support of\n\n                                           4\n\fthe verdict. In re Columbia Med. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Subsidiary, L.P., 290 S.W.3d\n204, 211 (Tex. 2009) (orig. proceeding). We must not substitute our judgment for\nthat of the jury and should remain cognizant that the jury is the sole judge of\nwitness credibility. Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson, 116 S.W.3d 757, 761\n(Tex. 2003).\n\nB.    Duty & Breach\n      In order to establish negligence, the plaintiff must produce evidence to\nestablish the existence of a duty and a breach of that duty. Lee Lewis Constr., Inc.\nv. Harrison, 70 S.W.3d 778, 782 (Tex. 2001). The existence of a duty is a question\nof law. Nat’l Convenience Stores, Inc. v. Matherne, 987 S.W.2d 145, 149 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1999, no pet.).\n\n      Under Texas law, an employer has a well-established non-delegable and\ncontinuous duty to furnish reasonably safe instrumentalities with which its\nemployees are to work. Farley v. M M Cattle Co., 529 S.W.2d 751, 754 (Tex.\n1975), overruled on other grounds, Parker v. Highland Park, Inc., 565 S.W.2d 512\n(Tex. 1978); see Austin v. Kroger Tex., L.P., — S.W.3d —, No. 14-0216, 2015 WL\n3641066, at *16 (Tex. Jun. 12, 2015). Therefore, Katy Springs, as Favalora’s\nemployer, had a duty to furnish Favalora with reasonably safe machinery.\n\n      To establish a breach of this duty, Favalora had to prove either that Katy\nSprings did something an ordinarily prudent employer exercising ordinary care\nwould not have done under the circumstances, or that Katy Springs did not do that\nwhich an ordinarily prudent employer would have done in the exercise of ordinary\ncare. Aguirre v. Vasquez, 225 S.W.3d 744, 757 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2007, no pet.). Whether a defendant breached its duty is a question of fact. Id.\n\n      The evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding\nthat Katy Springs breached its duty to furnish Favalora with reasonably safe\n                                          5\n\fmachinery. At the time of the accident, Katy Springs owned two pay-off reels—the\ncompany-made reel and a “yellow reel” made by Spectral Systems. The company-\nmade reel lacked two safety mechanisms that the yellow reel had: (1) a safety\nbrake intended to prevent creeping of the basket when the machine is stopped, and\n(2) containment arms designed to allow wire to escape only from a particular area,\nknown as the “escapement area.” The steel support arms of the company-made reel\nhad deep gouges that trapped the wire and caused it to build tension with each\nrevolution. Instead of containment arms to prevent wire from escaping, the top of\nthe company-made reel had a three-inch gap that allowed the tensioned wire to\nescape in a 360-degree pattern.\n\n      The jury heard testimony from several of Katy Springs’ employees. These\nemployees generally agreed that Favalora should “run away” if the wire started\nescaping from the three-inch gap after having become trapped by the gouges. The\nemployees confirmed that wire had escaped from the reel in the past. Favalora\ntestified that wire escaped from the company-made reel twice during his shift on\nOctober 4, 2010. Despite these concerns, Katy Springs made no effort to repair or\nchange the design of the company-made reel.\n\n      Based on the testimony and evidence, reasonable jurors could have\nconcluded that Katy Springs did not act as a reasonable employer when it allowed\nFavalora to work on the company-made reel that lacked any safety features and\nwas recognized as being unsafe by several Katy Springs employees. The evidence\nfurnishes some reasonable basis for fair-minded people to reach the conclusion that\nKaty Springs breached its duty to provide Favalora with reasonably safe\nmachinery. Furthermore, based on our review of the entire record, the evidence\nsupporting the jury’s finding that Katy Springs breached its duty is not so weak,\nand the evidence to the contrary is not so overwhelming, that the finding should be\n\n                                         6\n\fset aside. Therefore, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\njury’s finding that Katy Springs breached its duty to provide Favalora with\nreasonably safe machinery. See Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. v. Burnett, No 12-10-00037-\nCV, 2012 WL 381714, at *13 (Tex. App.—Tyler Feb. 3, 2012, no pet.) (mem.\nop.); LMC Complete Auto., Inc. v. Burke, 229 S.W.3d 469, 477 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2007, pet. denied).\n\nC.     Proximate Cause\n       A plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s negligence was the proximate\ncause of his injuries. Ambrosio v. Carter’s Shooting Ctr., Inc., 20 S.W.3d 262, 265\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). To establish proximate\ncause, the plaintiff must prove foreseeability and cause in fact. Id. To establish\nforeseeability, the plaintiff must show that the defendant should have anticipated\nthe dangers that its negligent act or omission created for others. Id. Foreseeability\nrequires only that the general danger, not the exact sequence of events that\nproduced the harm, be foreseeable. Id.\n\n       The test for cause in fact is whether the negligent act or omission was a\nsubstantial factor in bringing about the injury, without which the harm would not\nhave occurred. Id. at 266. The plaintiff must prove cause in fact with evidence of\nprobative force. Id. Cause in fact is not shown if the defendant’s negligence did no\nmore than furnish a condition that made the injury possible. Id. Instead, the\nevidence must show that the negligence was the proximate, not the remote, cause\nof the injuries and justify the conclusion that the injury was the natural probable\nresult. Id.\n\n       Generally, the issue of proximate cause is a question of fact. Id. It can be a\nquestion of law in potentially two situations: (1) when the evidence is without\nmaterial dispute and where only one reasonable inference may be drawn, and (2)\n\n                                          7\n\fwhen the relationship between the plaintiff’s injuries and the defendant’s\nnegligence is attenuated or remote. Id. Both causation elements can be established\nby direct or circumstantial evidence. McClure v. Allied Stores of Tex., Inc., 608\nS.W.2d 901, 903 (Tex. 1980).\n\n      The cause-in-fact element is satisfied in this case. Katy Springs built the\ncompany-made reel from which the wire escaped. The wire escaped because of the\ngouges in the support arms, which trapped the wire and allowed it to build tension,\nand the three-inch gap at the top of the reel, which allowed the tensioned wire to\nescape the confines of the company-made reel. When the wire escaped on October\n5, 2010, it impacted Favalora and caused him to fall. The jury could have\nconcluded from this evidence that Katy Springs’ failure to provide Favalora with\nreasonably safe machinery was a substantial factor in his fall, one without which\nhis fall would not have occurred. See, e.g., Nw. Mall, Inc. v. Lubri-Lon Int’l, Inc.,\n681 S.W.2d 797, 803 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      The evidence also supports a conclusion that Favalora’s injuries were\nforeseeable. Katy Springs was aware that the company-made reel posed a safety\nhazard. The company’s training program included the instruction to “run away” if\nthe wire began to escape from the company-made reel. The company-made reel\nhad deep gouges that caused the wire to build tension during operation. An\nemployee testified that wire had escaped from the gap on at least two prior\noccasions. Favalora testified that wire had escaped twice since he started working\nat Katy Springs. The jury could have concluded from this evidence that Katy\nSprings should have anticipated the dangers that its company-made reel posed. See,\ne.g., Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 550 (Tex. 1985) (evidence\nthat prior violent crimes had occurred at apartment complex raised fact issue on\nforeseeability of criminal activity); Rosas v. Buddies Food Store, 518 S.W.2d 534,\n\n                                         8\n\f538 (Tex. 1975) (harm was foreseeable in slip-and-fall case when evidence showed\nthat similar incidents had occurred in the past and defendant’s store manager was\ncontinually trying to fix problem of water accumulation at the entrance); Pipgras v.\nHart, 832 S.W.2d 360, 364 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1992, writ denied); Lubri-\nLon, 681 S.W.2d at 803.\n\n      To the extent Katy Springs argues that expert testimony was necessary to\nestablish causation, we disagree. “[N]on-expert evidence alone is sufficient to\nsupport a finding of causation in limited circumstances where both the occurrence\nand conditions complained of are such that the general experience and common\nsense of laypersons are sufficient to evaluate the conditions and whether they were\nprobably caused by the occurrence.” Guevara v. Ferrer, 247 S.W.3d 662, 668\n(Tex. 2007); see also Kemp v. Havens, No. 14-05-00060-CV, 2006 WL 1140319,\nat *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 27, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.). Here,\nprior to the accident, Favalora was able to do manual labor. He was able to\nparticipate in athletic endeavors, such as volleyball, swimming, and working out.\nHe was essentially pain free. After the accident he suffered excruciating pain and\nhad to undergo spinal surgery that fused several of his vertebrae. Dr. Bartholomew,\nFavalora’s neurosurgeon, stated that the surgery would permanently affect\nFavalora’s ability to participate in certain physical activities. Favalora’s mobility\nwould be permanently limited. On this record, the jury could have concluded\nwithout expert testimony that the injuries Favalora suffered were caused by Katy\nSprings’ negligence. See Guevara, 247 S.W.3d at 669; Morgan v. Compugraphic\nCorp., 675 S.W.2d 729, 732 (Tex. 1984).\n\n      Moreover, contrary to Katy Springs’ assertions, the jury’s finding on\ncausation is supported by expert medical evidence. Dr. Bartholomew testified by\nvideo deposition. During his testimony the following exchange occurred:\n\n                                         9\n\f      [Favalora’s counsel]: Do you believe that Joseph [Favalora], based on\n      what he’s told you, was injured at that time?\n      [Dr. Bartholomew]: Yes, sir.\n      [Favalora’s counsel]: Based on reasonable medical probability, what\n      is your opinion on what injuries Joseph sustained - - injuries or\n      conditions as a result of that incident [at Katy Springs]?\n      ...\n      [Dr. Bartholomew]: As far as the cervical spine, I think he had an\n      aggravation of a preexisting condition in his neck which caused it to\n      become symptomatic.\n\nThis expert testimony is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s judgment.\nSee, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores Tex., LP v. Crosby, 295 S.W.3d 346, 352–53 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied) (doctor’s testimony that defendant’s negligence\nresulted in an aggravation of a preexisting condition was legally sufficient to\nsupport the trial court’s findings on causation).\n\n      Katy Springs also emphasizes that Dr. Bartholomew characterized\nFavalora’s injuries as a worsening of a preexisting condition. It is axiomatic that a\ntortfeasor takes a plaintiff as he finds him. Coates v. Whittington, 758 S.W.2d 749,\n752 (Tex. 1988). If a latent condition does not cause pain or suffering, but that\ncondition plus an injury caused such pain, then the injury, and not the latent\ncondition, is the proximate cause. Thompson v. Quarles, 297 S.W.2d 321, 329\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1956, writ ref’d n.r.e.); see City of Hous. v. Celaya,\n390 S.W.2d 542, 546 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Here, as a\nresult of a car accident several years before the accident at Katy Springs, Favalora\nsuffered trauma to his spine that required surgery to fuse his C4-5 vertebrae.\nFavalora testified that it took a long time to recover from the surgery. However, the\nevidence indicates that he had in fact recovered. In the time leading up to the\nincident, Favalora was able to work out and exercise. He taught swim lessons. He\n\n                                          10\n\fplayed volleyball. He worked for his now ex-girlfriend’s father building pools—a\nmanual-labor job that required heavy lifting. He testified that he was essentially\npain free at the time of the accident at Katy Springs. The jury could have found\nfrom this evidence that Favalora’s prior injury was a latent condition that did not\ncause him pain or suffering at the time of the accident. Therefore, the jury could\nhave concluded that the injury, and not the preexisting condition, was the\nproximate cause of Favalora’s harm. See Thompson, 297 S.W.2d at 329.1\n\n       In sum, the evidence of causation furnishes some reasonable basis for fair-\nminded people to reach the conclusion that Katy Springs’ negligence proximately\ncaused Favalora’s injuries. The evidence supporting the jury’s finding that\nFavalora’s injury was caused by Katy Springs’ negligence is not so weak, and the\nevidence to the contrary is not so overwhelming, that the finding should be set\naside. Therefore, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\njury’s finding that Katy Springs’ breach proximately caused Favalora’s injuries.\n\nIII.   WHETHER FAVALORA’S CONDUCT WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF HIS INJURIES\n       In its second issue, Katy Springs contends that Favalora was the sole cause\nof his injuries. It asserts that had Favalora turned the lathe off before approaching\nthe reel, the incident would not have happened. Katy Springs further argues that\nFavalora’s testimony was conflicting on this issue.\n\n       1\n         To the extent Katy Springs’ argument has any bearing on the jury’s award for past\nmedical expenses, the jury was instructed: “Do not include any amount for any condition that\nexisted before the occurrence in question, except to the extent, if any, that such other condition\nwas aggravated by any injuries that resulted from the occurrence in question.” The jury is\npresumed to have followed the court’s instructions. Columbia Rio Grande Healthcare, L.P. v.\nHawley, 284 S.W.3d 851, 862 (Tex. 2009). Katy Springs did not argue and did not point to any\nevidence in the record suggesting that the jury did not follow the instruction. Therefore, we\npresume the jury took Favalora’s prior injury into account when it awarded damages for past\nmedical expenses.\n\n\n                                               11\n\f      In an action by an employee against a nonsubscriber employer, “it is not a\ndefense that: (1) the employee was guilty of contributory negligence; (2) the\nemployee assumed the risk of injury or death; or (3) the injury or death was caused\nby the negligence of a fellow employee.” Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 406.033(a) (West\n2015). Therefore, it does not matter if the plaintiff was negligent or helped cause\nhis own injury, unless his negligence was the sole cause of the injury. Hall v.\nTimmons, 987 S.W.2d 248, 254–55 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1999, no pet.).\n\n      It is the province of the jury to resolve the conflicts in the evidence. City of\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 820. When pressed by Katy Springs’ counsel, Favalora made\nclear that he did in fact turn the lathe off before he approached the reel. The jury\ncould have believed Favalora’s testimony and concluded that he was not a cause,\nlet alone the sole cause, of his injuries. Even if the jury did not believe that\nFavalora turned the lathe off, the fact that this allegedly negligent act may have\ncontributed to Favalora’s injury does not avail Katy Springs. As discussed above,\nthe evidence indicates that Katy Springs bore at least some responsibility for the\nincident—it knew of the potential hazard, it assigned a new employee to work on\nthe production line with unsafe machinery, and its failure to provide reasonably\nsafe machinery caused Favalora harm. At most, the evidence pointed out by Katy\nSprings shows Favalora was guilty of contributory negligence, which is not a\ndefense available to nonsubscribers. See Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 406.033(a). We\noverrule Katy Springs’ second issue.\n\nIV.   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT JURY’S DAMAGE AWARDS\n      In its third issue, Katy Springs challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\nsupport the jury’s award of damages. In three sub-issues, Katy Springs contends:\n\n      (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to justify the award for past\n          medical expenses;\n\n                                         12\n\f      (2) the evidence is legally insufficient to justify the award for past\n          and future mental anguish; and\n      (3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to justify the\n          award for past and future physical impairment.\n\nWe consider each sub-issue in turn.\n\nA.    Past Medical Expenses\n      In its first sub-issue, Katy Springs argues the evidence supporting the jury’s\naward of past medical expenses is legally insufficient. Katy Springs’ argument\nfocuses on the existence of a causal nexus between the event sued upon and the\nplaintiff’s injuries. Katy Springs claims that the only evidence of a compensable\ninjury consists of the medical records submitted by Favalora. According to Katy\nSprings, the medical records are no substitute for expert testimony on causation\nbecause laymen lack the requisite knowledge to understand the intricacies of neck\ninjuries and surgeries. Katy Springs does not claim on appeal that the medical\nexpenses were not reasonable and necessary, and, except to the extent Katy\nSprings raises an issue regarding the erroneous admission of duplicative medical\nbills (an issue we consider in Section V.D below), it has not challenged the amount\nthe jury awarded for past medical expenses. We therefore consider only whether a\ncausal nexus existed between the event sued upon and Favalora’s injuries.\n\n      A plaintiff can recover only for injuries caused by the event made the basis\nof suit. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp., Inc. v. Murdock, 946 S.W.2d 836, 839–40 (Tex.\n1997). This causal nexus inquiry is “strictly referable to the damages portion of the\nplaintiff’s action.” Morgan, 675 S.W.2d at 732. “Even if the defendant’s liability\nhas been established, proof of this causal nexus is necessary to ascertain the\namount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.” Id. The causal nexus must be\nshown by competent evidence. Id. Lay testimony is generally adequate to prove\ncausation when general experience and common sense will enable a layman to\n                                         13\n\fdetermine, with reasonable probability, the causal relationship between the event\nand the condition. Id. at 733. Lay testimony establishing a sequence of events\nproviding a strong, logically traceable connection between the event and the\ncondition is sufficient proof of causation. Id.\n\n      Applying these principles, we conclude there is some evidence to support\nthe jury’s award. The evidence shows that Favalora was in good health prior to\nbeginning his employment at Katy Springs. Favalora was able to do manual labor.\nHe was able to participate in athletic endeavors, such as volleyball, swimming, and\nworking out. He was essentially pain free. After several weeks of working at Katy\nSprings, Favalora’s supervisors assigned him to work on a production line with the\ncompany-made reel. During Favalora’s shift, wire escaped from the company-\nmade reel at a high velocity and struck Favalora in the chest. After the accident,\nFavalora suffered excruciating pain and had to undergo spinal surgery that fused\nseveral of his vertebrae. Dr. Bartholomew stated that the fusion surgery would\npermanently affect Favalora’s ability to participate in certain physical activities\nand that Favalora’s mobility would be permanently limited.\n\n      This evidence establishes a sequence of events from which the trier of fact\nmay infer that the wire escaping from the company-made reel caused Favalora to\nsuffer injury. And, as discussed in Section II.C above, there is ample evidence\nsupporting the jury’s finding that Katy Springs’ negligence aggravated Favalora’s\nearlier injuries and caused him additional injuries. See Crosby, 295 S.W.3d at 353.\nTherefore, we conclude there is some evidence in the record to support the trial\ncourt’s award of damages for past medical expenses. See Morgan, 675 S.W.2d at\n733. We overrule this sub-issue.\n\nB.    Past and Future Mental Anguish\n      In the second sub-issue, Katy Springs contends the evidence is legally\n\n                                          14\n\finsufficient to support the jury’s award for past and future mental anguish.\nQuestion 2 of the trial court’s charge asked what sum of money would fairly and\nreasonably compensate Favalora for his injures, if any, that resulted from the\noccurrence in question. For mental anguish sustained in the past, the jury’s answer\nwas $150,000. For future mental anguish, the jury awarded Favalora $100,000.\n\n1.    Applicable Law\n      Under Texas law, mental anguish damages are recoverable in virtually all\npersonal-injury actions, including negligence actions. City of Tyler v. Likes, 962\nS.W.2d 489, 495 (Tex. 1997). However, even when an occurrence is of the type for\nwhich mental anguish damages are recoverable, evidence of the nature, duration,\nand severity of the mental anguish is required. Hancock v. Variyam, 400 S.W.3d\n59, 68 (Tex. 2013). An award of mental anguish damages will survive a legal\nsufficiency challenge when the plaintiff introduces direct evidence of the nature,\nduration, and severity of his mental anguish, thus establishing a substantial\ndisruption in the plaintiff’s routine. Fifth Club, Inc. v. Ramirez, 196 S.W.3d 788,\n797 (Tex. 2006); Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d 434, 444 (Tex. 1995). The\nabsence of direct evidence, especially when it can be supplied or procured by the\nplaintiff, justifies close judicial scrutiny of other evidence on this element of\ndamages. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d at 444. In the absence of direct evidence, we\napply traditional “no evidence” standards to determine whether the record “reveals\nany evidence of ‘a high degree of mental pain and distress’ that is ‘more than mere\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger’ to support any award of\ndamages.” Id. In sum, “mental anguish is only compensable if it causes a\nsubstantial disruption in daily routine or a high degree of mental pain and distress.”\nHancock, 400 S.W.3d at 68 (internal quotation and editorial marks omitted).\n\n      Direct evidence can take the form of the claimant’s own testimony or that of\n\n                                         15\n\fa third party or expert witness. Anderson v. Long, 118 S.W.3d 806, 811 (Tex.\nApp.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.). Mental anguish can be established through\nwitness testimony explaining how the injured party felt and how the injured party’s\nlife was disrupted. See Minn. Life Ins. Co. v. Vasquez, 133 S.W.3d 320, 324 (Tex.\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2004), rev’d on other grounds, 192 S.W.3d 774 (Tex. 2006).\nHowever, “[s]imply because a [witness] says [the plaintiff] suffered mental\nanguish does not constitute evidence of the nature, duration, and severity of any\nmental anguish that is sufficient to show a substantial disruption of one’s daily\nroutine.” Gunn Infiniti, Inc. v. O’Byrne, 996 S.W.2d 854, 861 (Tex. 1999).\n\n      Mental anguish includes the mental sensation of pain resulting from such\nemotions as grief, severe disappointment, indignation, wounded pride, shame,\ndespair, and public humiliation. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d at 444; Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nMorris, 287 S.W.3d 401, 425 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009), rev’d on\nother grounds, 383 S.W.3d 146 (Tex. 2012).\n\n      Recovery is warranted in such cases where the plaintiff’s mental pain\n      has risen to such a level that it has rendered him or her incapable of\n      dealing with certain everyday activities. For instance, as a result of the\n      mental pain, the plaintiff suffers from a myriad of negative emotions;\n      some of these emotions may manifest themselves in such a way as to\n      make it difficult for the plaintiff to eat, sleep, work, socially interact,\n      or carry on any other activity which, until the time of the alleged\n      injury, he or she could accomplish on a day-to-day basis without\n      difficulty.\nDillard Dep’t Store, Inc. v. Silva, 106 S.W.3d 789, 800 (Tex. App.—Texarkana\n2003) (internal citations omitted), aff’d as modified, 148 S.W.3d 370 (Tex. 2004).\nThere are no magic words to establish mental anguish; rather, courts can look at\nthe totality of the circumstances, as well as the words used. Comstock Silversmiths,\nInc. v. Carey, 894 S.W.2d 56, 58 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1995, no writ).\n\n\n                                          16\n\f      A jury cannot automatically infer mental anguish once any physical injury is\nsustained. Ontiveroas v. Lozano, No. 14-05-00294-CV, 2006 WL 1140374, at *2\n(Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 29, 2006, no pet.) (mem. op.); see Gibbins\nv. Berlin, 162 S.W.3d 335, 344 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2005, no pet.). “There\nmust, instead, be specific evidence upon which an award for mental anguish may\nbe upheld.” Ontiveroas, 2006 WL 1140374, at *2; see also id. at *2, n.4 (rejecting\nas obiter dictum assertion from Kingham Messenger & Delivery Serv., Inc. v.\nDaniels, 435 S.W.2d 270, 273 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1968, no\nwrit), that “[m]ental anguish will be implied from illness, or injuries, accompanied\nby physical pain, and it may arise from a sense of discomfort or inconvenience.”).\nAlthough the fact of a physical injury does not alone support an award for mental\nanguish damages, we can consider the traumatic nature of an injury as a factor in\ndeciding whether the award is supported by the evidence. See, e.g., Finley v. P.G.,\n428 S.W.3d 229, 236–37 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.);\nSunBridge Healthcare Corp. v. Penny, 160 S.W.3d 230, 251–52 (Tex. App.—\nTexarkana 2005, no pet.).\n\n      To support an award for future mental anguish, a plaintiff must demonstrate\na reasonable probability that he would suffer compensable mental anguish in the\nfuture. Adams v. YMCA of San Antonio, 265 S.W.3d 915, 917 (Tex. 2008). To\nmeet the reasonable probability rule, a plaintiff must (1) present evidence that, in\nreasonable probability, he will suffer damages in the future and (2) prove the\nprobable reasonable amount of the future damages. N.N. v. Inst. for Rehab. &\nResearch, 234 S.W.3d 1, 10 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.).\n\n2.    Evidence Related to Favalora’s Mental Anguish\n      As an initial matter, our review of the evidence is limited. Because the jury\nprovided separate awards for physical pain and suffering, physical impairment, and\n\n                                        17\n\fmental anguish, evidence related to Favalora’s physical pain and suffering and\nphysical impairment is not relevant to the jury’s award of mental anguish. See, e.g.,\nBowman v. Patel, No. 01-10-00811-CV, 2012 WL 524428, at *2 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] Feb. 16, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.); Rice Food Mkts., Inc. v.\nWilliams, 47 S.W.3d 734, 739 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied)\n(where jury made separate awards for pain and mental anguish, evidence of\nplaintiff’s pain was not relevant to the defendant’s challenge of the award for\nmental anguish).\n\n      Favalora testified regarding the personal struggles he faced after the injury.\nMany of these struggles were associated with the financial effect of being\nphysically unable to work and incurring medical expenses. In response to a\nquestion about his experiences during the first few weeks after the accident,\nFavalora stated:\n\n      I’m not able to do anything. . . . I didn’t leave my apartment. I didn’t\n      do anything. First of all, I wasn’t making any money, so I was slowly\n      losing everything I owned by the day. Starts off slow and you sell a\n      piece of furniture here and there. I sold my car. You know, eventually\n      you get to the point where you’re going to Plato’s Closet selling your\n      clothes just to feed yourself and then eventually I lost my apartment.\nHe further testified:\n\n      I was living with my aunt. Thank God she was there to take me in\n      because at this point several months after the accident, I basically lost\n      everything. I think I touched on it earlier, I had to sell my car. I had to\n      - - I slowly started selling off pieces of my furniture, my TVs, all that\n      kind of stuff. Eventually I was literally left with a couch and a small\n      TV in my living room. And I could no longer afford to pay the rent.\nAfter he relocated to Louisiana, Favalora started consulting with Dr. Bartholomew.\nIt became apparent to Favalora that he might have to have another surgery. When\ndiscussing this possibility at trial, Favalora stated, “I was not happy about it.” In\n\n                                          18\n\fresponse to a question about his outlook when he started visiting Dr. Bartholomew,\nFavalora stated:\n\n      Well, I already knew I needed surgery. So at this point I was willing -\n      - I had lost the job at G-2 [Partners], lost my apartment once again and\n      lost all of my belongings. At that point I really looked at the surgery\n      in a different way that it was now to me more something that I had to\n      do to be able to get on with my life. Because it was just becoming like\n      a detour, like lingering. And the pain wasn’t going away, all of the\n      alternative treatments had failed.\n\n      Katie Vollmer, Favalora’s then-girlfriend, also testified about Favalora’s\nemotional state. Vollmer described Favalora’s mental state prior to the accident as\n“always smiling” and “always happy.” He was never stressed out even when the\ncouple had financial problems. Favalora was someone she could go to with a\nproblem. After the accident, however, Favalora was “not in a good place”\nemotionally. Vollmer described Favalora as “quiet and sad” and “not himself.”\nVollmer noted that “it was so unlike him to just lay [sic] down or sit down.” “He\ncouldn’t get up and do the things he used to do, and I think that really got to him.”\n\n      On the subject of Favalora’s decision to have surgery, Vollmer testified that\nFavalora was “very optimistic” about the surgery. He was “ready to just feel\nbetter.” And after the surgery, “he was still, I mean, very optimistic about, you\nknow, the outcome and hoping, you know, it will finally make him feel better.”\nVollmer noted that Favalora was improving emotionally after the surgery. “He just\nseems like he’s more up and going and ready to go do things.” He was “getting\nback to himself, you know. He wants to move back here [to the Houston area] and\nfinish school, and he just seems to joke around more and just has more life about\nhim, you know.”\n\n      In contrast to Vollmer’s relatively optimistic perspective of Favalora’s\nmental state, Dr. Bartholomew described Favalora as depressed and recommended\n\n                                          19\n\fthat Favalora seek psychiatric treatment. Responding to a question about how\nFavalora has done since the fusion surgery, Dr. Bartholomew stated, “I recommend\n- - physical therapy is common after a surgery, psychiatric because he’s obviously\ndepressed. And, unfortunately, he’s not done very well. He’s had continuing neck\npain and getting very depressed with it.” Dr. Bartholomew continued:\n\n      He’s depressed, obviously depressed. And we know that pain and\n      depression go hand in hand. And the longer people have pain, the\n      more likely they are to be depressed and the less likely they are to\n      recover without some treatment for their depression.\nExplaining how he knew Favalora was depressed, Dr. Bartholomew stated, “I think\nhe even cried in the office. I mean, he tells me he’s depressed. You can just look at\nhim and talk to him and - - I’m pretty sure he cried in the office.” Later in his\ntestimony, the doctor added, “Yeah. I noted in my note of May 30th, 2013, ‘Even\nalmost crying in the office.’” Doctor Bartholomew explained that depression is\ncommon for people experiencing chronic pain. Discussing Favalora’s future\nprognosis, Doctor Bartholomew testified:\n\n      I think we need to get him, as I recommended, in physical therapy and\n      psychiatric treatment, otherwise he’s going to have a miserable future.\n      He’s already developed depression, basically crying in the office.\n      He’s told me he’s been to the emergency room, not because he had an\n      increase in his pain, just he couldn’t deal with it [the pain], so tired of\n      living with it [the pain]. So I think that, you know, he’s going to\n      become a long-term chronic pain patient. And especially with a\n      psychological overlay from the depression, it’s not a very bright\n      future. That’s why we need to get him into [physical] therapy and get\n      him to a psychiatrist.\n\n3.    Analysis\n      With regard to past mental anguish damages, the evidence does show that, as\na result of the accident, Favalora experienced some level of mental pain separate\nand apart from the physical pain and physical impairment. Whereas before the\n                                          20\n\faccident, Favalora was “always smiling” and “always happy,” after the accident,\nhe was “quiet and sad” and “very depressed.” This evidence shows that Favalora’s\nattitude changed after the incident. Favalora also experienced relationship and\nfinancial struggles after the accident. He and his girlfriend broke up. He was\ncompelled to move in with an aunt because he could no longer pay his bills. He\nultimately had to return to Louisiana as a result of the financial strain. The jury\ncould have inferred from Favalora’s attitudinal changes and the attendant hardships\nthat Favalora had suffered a high degree of mental pain and distress beyond mere\nworry, vexation, embarrassment, or anger. Therefore, the evidence is legally\nsufficient to support the jury’s finding of past mental anguish.\n\n      With regard to future mental anguish, the evidence does not demonstrate a\nreasonable probability that Favalora will suffer compensable mental anguish in the\nfuture. The severity of Favalora’s injury and the evidence of his mental pain\nsimply do not rise to the level of the severity of the injury and the evidence\npropounded in other personal-injury cases. For instance, in Fifth Club, the plaintiff\nhad been severely beaten by a security guard at a club. 196 S.W.3d at 790. He\nsuffered a fractured skull when the guard slammed his head against a concrete wall\nand struck him several times. Id. The plaintiff and his wife testified that he\ncontinued to be depressed, humiliated, non-communicative, unable to sleep, and\nangry. Id. at 797. He continued to have headaches, and his daily activities and\nrelationships with his wife and daughter continued to be detrimentally affected\nnearly two years after the beating. Id. The plaintiff also presented evidence of the\nseverity of the intentional beating, including significant injuries to his head and\nbody, loss of consciousness, and multiple visits to the hospital. Id. This evidence\nwas legally sufficient to support an award for future mental anguish damages\nbecause it showed the nature of the plaintiff’s mental anguish, its lasting duration,\n\n\n                                          21\n\fand the severity of his injuries. Id. at 797–98.2\n\n       In contrast, the only evidence in the record concerning Favalora’s future\nmental anguish—separate and apart from the evidence related to Favalora’s pain\nand suffering and physical impairment—was Dr. Bartholomew’s testimony that\nFavalora was “very depressed.” Although the words “very depressed” can imply\nmore than mere worry, anxiety, embarrassment, or anger, we must look at the\ntotality of the circumstances as well as the words used. See Carey, 894 S.W.2d at\n58. Here, the doctor’s conclusions—that Favalora was very depressed and could\nlook forward to a bleak future unless he received psychiatric treatment—are not\nspecific evidence of the lasting nature, severity, and duration of Favalora’s future\nmental anguish. See Gonzalez v. Temple-Inland Mortg. Corp., 28 S.W.3d 622, 626\n(Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, no pet.) (“Testimony in support of mental anguish\n\n       2\n          See also Adams, 265 S.W.3d at 917 (upholding award for future mental anguish when\nevidence showed that child who was sexually assaulted was using denial as a coping mechanism,\nwould experience poor performance in school, wrote a letter expressing intense anger and\nresentment, had angry outbursts, and expert testimony indicated that he would more than likely\nface other emotional issues in the future); Finley, 428 S.W.3d at 235 (evidence was sufficient to\nsupport future mental anguish award when evidence showed that cognitively disadvantaged 21-\nyear-old man who was sexually assaulted by pastor felt like a whore, could not sleep, had trouble\nmaintaining employment, and, in light of Fifth Club, the trier of fact could have considered the\ntraumatic nature of the assault); Inst. for Rehab. & Research, 234 S.W.3d at 18 (evidence was\nsufficient to support award of future mental anguish damages when evidence showed brain-\ninjured plaintiff who was sexually assaulted by another brain-injured patient felt dirty, was\nembarrassed, could not speak, feared going to sleep, apologized for not stopping the assault, was\nincapable of treatment through traditional counseling or therapy, and, among other things, would\ncontinue to remember the assault more in the future as her memory improved); Gen.

Anderson, 78 S.W.3d 392, 412 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, judgment vacated w.r.m.)

Williamson, 111\nS.W.3d 113 (Tex. 2003).\n\n                                               22\n\fdamages must provide specific details of the nature, duration, and severity of the\nmental anguish. Conclusory statements are not sufficient.”). We conclude the\nevidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s award of future mental anguish\ndamages.\n\n      In sum, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s finding of\npast mental anguish. However, the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate a\nreasonable probability that Favalora would suffer compensable mental anguish in\nthe future. Accordingly, we overrule Katy Springs’ sub-issue challenging the jury’s\nfinding of past mental anguish. We sustain Katy Springs’ sub-issue challenging the\njury’s finding of future mental anguish. See Lubbock Cnty. v. Strube, 953 S.W.2d\n847, 857 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, pet. denied).\n\nC.    Past and Future Physical Impairment\n      The jury awarded Favalora $19,000 for past physical impairment and\n$100,000 for future physical impairment. Katy Springs contends the evidence was\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the jury’s finding of past and future\nphysical impairment.\n\n      Physical impairment, sometimes called loss of enjoyment of life,\nencompasses the loss of the injured party’s former lifestyle. Enright v. Goodman\nDistrib., Inc., 330 S.W.3d 392, 402 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no\npet.). To receive physical impairment damages, the plaintiff must prove that the\neffect of his physical impairment extends beyond any impediment to his earning\ncapacity and beyond any pain and suffering to the extent that it produces a separate\nand distinct loss that is substantial and for which he should be compensated.\nSchindler Elevator, 78 S.W.3d at 412. That is, the plaintiff must show that (1) he\nincurred injuries that are distinct from, or extend beyond, injuries compensable as\npain and suffering, loss of earning capacity, or other damage elements and (2)\n\n                                         23\n\fthese distinct injuries have had a “substantial” effect. Burry, 203 S.W.3d at 554–\n55. If other damage elements such as pain, suffering, mental anguish, and\ndisfigurement are submitted, then there is little left for which to compensate under\nthe category of physical impairment other than loss of enjoyment of life. Golden\nEagle, 116 S.W.3d at 772. Awards for physical impairment do not always require\negregious injuries. Rosenboom Mach. & Tool, Inc. v. Machala, 995 S.W.2d 817,\n824 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, pet. denied).\n\n       Here, Favalora testified that after his injury he could not help care for his ex-\ngirlfriend’s daughter. He explained that he could no longer work out or engage in\nother physical activities he had enjoyed in the past. Dr. Bartholomew testified that\nas a result of the double-fusion surgery, Favalora would lose between fifteen and\nthirty percent of the range of motion in his neck. According to the doctor, this loss\nof range of motion would make simple tasks, such as descending a staircase,\ndifficult because Favalora will not be able to move his head enough to see his feet.\nAdditionally, Favalora will be unable to lift heavy weights, which will necessarily\ncurtail his ability to work out, an activity he enjoyed before the accident. After\nreviewing the entire record and given the lack of evidence to the contrary, we\nconclude this evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s\nfinding of past and future physical impairment.

Medical Bills “Actually Paid or Incurred”\n       During the pretrial and trial stages of this case, the parties engaged in an\nongoing dispute concerning the evidence of Favalora’s medical bills. During the\ndiscovery process, Katy Springs learned that several of Favalora’s medical\nproviders had sold, at a discount, accounts receivable to MedStar Funding, a\ncompany engaged in the business of accounts receivable financing, also known as\n“factoring.”4 Katy Springs now claims the trial court erred in admitting invoices\nshowing the full amounts charged by the medical providers rather than the amounts\nthe medical providers received in return for selling their accounts receivable to\nMedStar. Citing section 41.0105 of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, the\nTexas Supreme Court’s decision in Haygood v. De Escabedo, 356 S.W.3d 390\n(Tex. 2011), and this court’s decision in Metropolitan Transit Authority v.\nMcChristian, 449 S.W.3d 846 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.),\nKaty Springs contends that a plaintiff’s recovery is limited to the amount that the\n       4\n          Factoring is a process by which a business sells to another business (the “factor”), at a\ndiscount, its right to collect money before the money is paid. Hous. Lighting & Power Co. v. City\nof Wharton, 101 S.W.3d 633, 636 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied). Factoring\nis a financing tool that reduces the amount of working capital a business needs by reducing the\ndelay between the time of sale and the receipt of payment. Id.; see also Plotkin v. Joekel, 304\nS.W.3d 455, 465 n.3 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied); Al Gailani v. Riyad\nBank Hous. Agency, 22 S.W.3d 560, 565 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2000) (citing Tex. Bus. & Com.\nCode Ann. § 9.502 cmt. 2 (Vernon 1991)), rev’d on other grounds, 61 S.W.3d 353 (Tex. 2001);\nNote, Policing Accounts Receivable & Inventory Under Modern Factor’s Legislation, 101 U. Pa.\nL. Rev. 392, 392 (1952) (explaining typical factoring scenarios).\n\n                                                26\n\fmedical providers have a right to be paid, which, in this case, is the amount for\nwhich MedStar purchased the accounts receivable from the providers.\n\n      In response, Favalora argues that section 41.0105, Haygood, and\nMcChristian have no effect on his recovery. Favalora posits that he incurred the\nfull amount of expenses billed by his medical providers because MedStar, which\npurchased the accounts receivable, is legally entitled to recover the full amount of\nthe charges billed, and he is contractually obligated to pay the full amount to\nMedStar. Favalora contends MedStar is a contractual assignee that stands in the\nshoes of its assignor—in this case, the medical providers.\n\n      Section 41.0105 provides: “In addition to any other limitation under law,\nrecovery of medical or health care expenses incurred is limited to the amount\nactually paid or incurred by or on behalf of the claimant.” Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode Ann. § 41.0105 (West 2015). The Texas Supreme Court construed this\nprovision in Haygood and held that “this statute limits recovery, and consequently\nthe evidence at trial, to expenses that the [medical] provider has a legal right to be\npaid.” 356 S.W.3d at 391. In Haygood, a personal-injury case arising from a car\naccident, twelve health care providers billed Haygood a total of $110,069.12.\nBecause Haygood was covered by Medicare Part B and pursuant to federal law\nprohibiting providers from charging patients more than Medicare deemed\nreasonable, Haygood’s health care providers adjusted their bills downward, leaving\na total amount due of $27,739.43. The trial court allowed Haygood to introduce\nevidence of the full amounts billed by his providers, and the jury awarded the full\namounts as past medical expenses. The court of appeals reversed. Id. at 392. In\naffirming the court of appeals, the Texas Supreme Court first concluded that the\ncollateral source rule, which precludes a reduction in a tortfeasor’s liability\nbecause of benefits received by the plaintiff from someone else, does not allow a\n\n                                         27\n\fplaintiff to recover medical expenses that a health care provider is not entitled to\ncharge. Id. at 396. Addressing section 41.0105, the court first reasoned that\n“actually paid and incurred” means “expenses that have been or will be paid, and\nexcludes the difference between such amount and charges the [medical] service\nprovider bills but has no right to be paid.” Id. at 397. Accordingly, the court held\nthat section 41.0105 “limits a claimant’s recovery of medical expenses to those\nwhich have been or must be paid by or for the claimant.” Id. at 398. The court next\nconsidered whether the evidence showing the full amounts billed by the health care\nproviders was nonetheless admissible. Because a claimant cannot recover medical\nexpenses that the medical provider is not entitled to be paid, the court reasoned that\nevidence of such medical expenses is irrelevant to the issue of damages and that\nthe probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the confusion it\nis likely to generate. Id. Therefore, only evidence of recoverable medical expenses\nis admissible at trial, where “recoverable medical expenses” means those expenses\nthat “have been or must be paid by or for the claimant.” Id. at 398–399.\n\n      The factual situation before us does not fit neatly into section 41.0105 or the\nHaygood court’s ruling. However, the Dallas Court of Appeals’ decision in Big\nBird Tree Service v. Gallegos, 365 S.W.3d 173 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet.\ndenied), is informative. In Gallegos, an indigent plaintiff received valuable medical\nservices from Parkland Hospital free of charge. 365 S.W.3d at 175. To prove his\nreasonable and necessary medical expenses, the plaintiff relied on affidavits with\nattached billing records from UT Southwestern and Parkland hospitals. The\namounts charged totaled $67,699.41 and $16,659.50 respectively. The jury\nawarded the plaintiff damages, including those incurred at Parkland. The defendant\nargued on appeal that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support\nthe award of expenses for services received at Parkland because the plaintiff\n\n\n                                         28\n\freceived the services free of charge. Id. In an offer of proof, Parkland’s custodian\nof records testified that if Parkland discovered that the patient was able to pay for\nthe services, then the patient would be billed for the services. Id. at 175–76. The\nevidence therefore indicated that the plaintiff would be required to pay if he were\nto obtain a recovery in a lawsuit or otherwise acquire the funds.\n\n      The Dallas court distinguished Haygood. First, the court noted that there was\nno evidence of any contract that would have prohibited the hospitals from charging\nthe plaintiff for the full value of the services rendered. Id. at 177. Second, the court\nemphasized that the plaintiff remained liable for the services rendered if he were to\nrecover the funds by other means. Id. The court then concluded that section\n41.0105 did not preclude the plaintiff from recovering. Id.\n\n      The facts of this case are similar to those of Gallegos. Favalora is uninsured\nand received valuable medical services. At the time of trial, Favalora had not paid\nfor those services. He testified to owing in excess of $200,000 in medical\nexpenses. The evidence attached to the parties’ respective motions on this issue,\nwhich the trial court considered in rendering its decision, shows that Favalora\nentered into contracts with several of his health care providers. Pursuant to these\ncontracts, Favalora assigned to the health care providers his interest in any\nproceeds that might be recovered as a result of his pending lawsuit. Favalora also\ngranted the providers a security interest in his potential tort recovery. MedStar then\npurchased, at a discount, the health care providers’ accounts receivable, including\nthe providers’ respective interests in the potential tort recovery and the liens on\nthose interests. Just as in Gallegos, there is no evidence of any contract that\nprohibited the health care providers from charging Favalora the full value of the\nservices rendered. Nor is there any evidence of a contract prohibiting MedStar\nfrom collecting the full value of the services rendered. To the contrary, the\n\n                                          29\n\fevidence considered by the trial court suggests that Favalora remained liable for\nthe full value of the services rendered.\n\n      The fact that the indigent plaintiff in Gallegos received the services free of\ncharge from a charitable organization does not change our conclusion that the\nobjected-to evidence was admissible. The evidence here, as in Gallegos, indicates\nthat the expenses must be paid by Favalora. Therefore, we cannot conclude that\nMedStar, by way of the medical providers, was not entitled to recover the full\nvalue of the services rendered. See Gallegos, 365 S.W.3d at 177; see also Cash v.\nCeladon Trucking Servs., Inc., No. 4:13-CV-461, 2014 WL 1381394, at *2 (S.D.\nTex. Apr. 7, 2014) (unpublished memorandum and order; finding erroneous\ndefendant’s interpretation of section 41.0105 that would limit plaintiff’s recovery\nto amount paid by factor). Consequently, the evidence showing the full value of the\nservices received by Favalora was admissible. See Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 399.\n\n      Katy Springs has pointed out the following sentence from this court’s\nopinion in McChristian: “A tortfeasor is not liable for medical expenses that the\nclaimant is not required to pay to the provider because allowing such a recovery\nwould bestow a windfall.” 449 S.W.3d at 852 (emphasis added); see also\nHaygood, 356 S.W.3d at 397 (“[A] tortfeasor is not liable to a health care provider\nor its patients for medical expenses the patients were not required to pay the\nprovider.” (emphasis added)). Focusing on the phrase “pay to the provider,” Katy\nSprings reasons that if the medical provider is no longer entitled to be paid, then\nthe claimant cannot recover the full amount of the medical expenses from the\ntortfeasor but must settle for the discounted amount received by the provider.\nAccording to Katy Springs, because Favalora’s medical providers were paid, albeit\nby a third party that purchased the right to collect the outstanding accounts\nreceivable, Favalora cannot recover the full amount from Katy Springs. We reject\n\n                                           30\n\fKaty Springs’ position, and we conclude that its reliance on Haygood and\nMcChristian is misplaced because those cases involved distinguishable\ncircumstances.\n\n      The circumstances here involve a factoring arrangement; Haygood and\nMcChristian did not. Haygood addressed section 41.0105’s applicability to\nexpenses for necessary medical care charged by health care providers who set\ncharges at a higher level but agreed to be reimbursed by insurers at a lower level\ndeemed to be reasonable based on “customary charges for similar services and\nprevailing charges in the same locality for similar services.” Haygood, 356 S.W.3d\nat 392 & n.7. McChristian addressed section 41.0105’s applicability to expenses\nfor necessary medical care that were provided to an uninsured plaintiff.\nMcChristian, 449 S.W.3d at 854. “As the supreme court explained, section\n41.0105 addresses the difficulty in determining reasonable expenses for necessary\nmedical care when ‘[h]ealth care providers set charges they maintain are\nreasonable while agreeing to reimbursement at much lower rates determined by\ninsurers to be reasonable, resulting in great disparities between amounts billed and\npayments accepted.’” Id. (quoting Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 391). This case does\nnot require us to address the disparity between higher charges set by medical\nproviders and lower “reasonable” reimbursement rates set by insurers.\n\n      This situation, in contrast, involves medical expenses that Favalora is\ncontractually obligated to pay in full. MedStar is the contractual assignee of\nFavalora’s medical providers. Katy Springs’ position ignores the longstanding\nprinciple that “an assignee under Texas common law stands in the shoes of his\nassignor.” See Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Marketing on Hold Inc., 308 S.W.3d 909, 920\n(Tex. 2010). In so doing, the assignee “receives the full rights of the assignor.”\nJackson v. Thweatt, 883 S.W.2d 171, 174 (Tex. 1994). Because MedStar holds\n\n                                        31\n\fcontractually valid assignments, MedStar “steps into the shoes” of the medical\nproviders and is considered under the law to “have the same ability to pursue the\nclaims” of the medical providers. See Marketing on Hold, 308 S.W.3d at 916.\nTherefore, under Texas law and by virtue of the assignments, MedStar and the\nmedical providers are one and the same for purposes of determining the\nadmissibility of evidence under section 41.0105 and Haygood.\n\n        In a factoring case, where the record indicates that the claimant remains\nliable for the amounts originally billed by the medical provider, such amounts are\nrecoverable medical expenses under section 41.0105, and evidence showing the\namounts billed by the medical provider is admissible. Accordingly, we overrule\nthis sub-issue.\n\nB.      Compliance with section 18.001, Civil Practice & Remedies Code\n        Katy Springs next contends Favalora’s Exhibits 39, 41, 43, 49, 51, 52, 53,\nand 60 do not comply with section 18.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies\nCode.\n\n        Section 18.001 is “purely procedural, providing for the use of affidavits to\nstreamline proof of the reasonableness and necessity of medical expenses.”\nHaygood, 356 S.W.3d at 397.\n\n        [A]n affidavit that the amount a person charged for a service was\n        reasonable at the time and place that the service was provided and that\n        the service was necessary is sufficient evidence to support a finding of\n        fact by judge or jury that the amount charged was reasonable or that\n        the service was necessary.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 18.001(b) (West 2015).\n\n        The affidavit must:\n        (1) be taken before an officer with authority to administer oaths;\n        (2) be made by:\n                                           32\n\f         (A) the person who provided the service; or\n         (B) the person in charge of records showing the service provided\n         and charge made; and\n      (3) include an itemized statement of the service and charge.\n\nId. § 18.001(c). In other words, to comply with section 18.001, an affidavit must:\n(1) state that the amount charged was reasonable; (2) state that the service was\nnecessary; (3) be taken before an officer with authority to administer oaths; (4) be\nmade by the provider or the person in charge of the records showing the service\nprovided; and (5) include an itemized statement of the service and charge. See id. §\n18.001; see also id. § 18.002 (West 2015) (sample affidavit forms).\n\n      Here, the challenged exhibits contain affidavits that comply with all of the\nsection 18.001 requirements. However, Katy Springs has emphasized that Dan\nChristensen, the person who signed the MedStar affidavit, which the trial court\nadmitted as Exhibit 60, was not a “medical provider” and therefore was not\nqualified to testify regarding the reasonableness of the charges. Katy Springs\nmischaracterizes the text of section 18.001, which contains the disjunctive “or”\nbetween the phrase, “the person who provided the service,” and the phrase, “the\nperson in charge of records showing the service provided and charge made.” Katy\nSprings has not identified, and we have not found in the record, any evidence\nsuggesting that Christensen is not the person in charge of the records showing the\nservices provided. In fact, the evidence considered by the court in making its\nevidentiary rulings suggests the opposite. The contracts between MedStar and the\nservice providers explicitly made MedStar the custodian of the pertinent records.\n\n      We overrule this sub-issue.\n\nC.    Refusal to Permit Pretrial Discovery on MedStar\n      Katy Springs contends the trial court erred in “refusing to allow pretrial\n\n                                        33\n\fdiscovery necessary for [it] to verify the accuracy of amounts stated in medical\nbilling affidavits submitted by [Favalora.]” This statement constitutes the entirety\nof Katy Springs’ argument regarding the trial court’s decision on Katy Springs’\nrequest for additional discovery. Katy Springs has not cited to any legal authority\nfor the appropriate standards on discovery error. Nor has it cited to authority or\nexplained how the trial court’s error, if any, was harmful. Accordingly, we\nconclude this issue is inadequately briefed. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1; Canton-\nCarter v. Baylor Coll. of Med., 271 S.W.3d 928, 931–32 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.). By failing to adequately brief this sub-issue, Katy\nSprings has waived it on appeal. We overrule this sub-issue.\n\nD.    Admission of Duplicative Affidavits and Medical Bills\n      Katy Springs contends the trial court erred by admitting multiple affidavits\nfor the same medical expenses. Specifically, Katy Springs claims that some\ncharges are covered by both an affidavit from the medical provider and the\naffidavit submitted by MedStar’s Christensen. Our review of the record confirms\nKaty Springs’ claim that some of the medical bills were submitted twice. For\nexample, in Exhibit 39, Nicole Lilly testified by affidavit on behalf of TOPS\nSurgical Hospital that Favalora still owed $11,482.97. Lilly attached an itemized\nbill to her affidavit. Christensen attached the same itemized bill to the MedStar\naffidavit, which was admitted as Exhibit 60. We conclude, however, that the trial\ncourt’s error, if any, was harmless.\n\n      The admission and exclusion of evidence are within the sound discretion of\nthe trial court. Bayer Corp. v. DX Terminals, Ltd., 214 S.W.3d 586, 609 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). The complaining party must show\nthat the trial court erred and that the error probably resulted in an improper\njudgment, which usually requires a showing that the judgment turned on the\n\n                                        34\n\fchallenged evidence. Id.\n\n       The evidence in this case indicates that the jury did not consider the\nduplicated bills when it determined the amount of past medical expenses to award\nFavalora.

The jury awarded only $204,627.02. Because the jury’s damages\naward is supported by a calculation and evidence not related to the medical bills\nattached to Christensen’s affidavit, we conclude the trial court’s error, if any, in\nadmitting duplicative medical bills was harmless. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.1; Bayer\nCorp., 214 S.W.3d at 609; Gulftide Gas Corp. v. Cox, 699 S.W.2d 239, 244 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1985, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Accordingly, we overrule this\nsub-issue.\n\nE.     Counter-affidavit of Dr. Steiner\n       In footnote five of its appellant’s brief, buried within its assertions about the\ntrial court’s failure to permit additional discovery, Katy Springs states:\n\n       By filing a CPRC 18.001 counter-affidavit, the non-offering party can\n       prevent the offering party’s affidavits of reasonableness and necessity\n       from being used as evidence and force the offering party to prove\n       reasonableness and necessity by expert testimony. Hong [v. Bennett],\n       209 S.W.3d [795,] 801 [(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2006, no pet.)].\n       Realizing the trial court was not going to allow Defendant the\n       discovery necessary to investigate the reasonableness and necessity of\n\n       6\n           The charges in Exhibit 56[E] are identical to the charges in Exhibit 56[D].\n       7\n           The charges in Exhibit 56[F] are identical to the charges in Exhibit 56[D].\n       8\n          Exhibit 56[H] was supported by three prescription billing reports. The second report\ncontained charges that occurred before the accident. The first and third reports were generated on\ndifferent dates but showed identical charges. Therefore, we counted only the first billing report.\n\n                                                  36\n\f      all the medical services provided to Plaintiff [Favalora], Defendant\n      [Katy Springs] nevertheless filed on October 4, 2013, a CPRC 18.001\n      controverting affidavit of Martin Roth Steiner, MD challenging the\n      necessity of the surgery performed on Plaintiff by Dr. Bartholomew.\n      (SCR-Vol. 13, pg. 5139). Plaintiff filed a Motion to Strike Counter-\n      Affidavits of Martin Steiner, M.D. on November 5, 2013. (SCR-Vo.\n      13, pg. 5253). The court granted Plaintiff’s motion. (RR-Vol. 5, pgs.\n      131:19-135:22). This issue was preserved for appeal as it was raised\n      in Defendant’s Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict.\n      (CR-Vol. 1, pg. 110).\n\n      To the extent Katy Springs raises an issue here, it is inadequately briefed.\nKaty Springs has the burden to present and discuss its assertions of error in\ncompliance with the appellate briefing rules. Cruz v. Van Sickle, 452 S.W.3d 503,\n511 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. filed). “It is not this court’s duty to review the\nrecord, research the law, and then fashion a legal argument for appellant when [it]\nhas failed to do so.” Canton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931–32; see Cruz, 452 S.W.3d\nat 511 (“We have no duty, or even right, to perform an independent review of the\nrecord and applicable law to determine whether there was error.”). Katy Springs\ndid not cite any legal authority or provide any analysis applying the appropriate\nlegal authority to the facts of its case in such a manner as to demonstrate the trial\ncourt committed reversible error when it excluded the counter-affidavit. See\nCanton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931.\n\n      Even if this issue were adequately briefed, Katy Springs waived any error\nfor appellate review. If a party does not challenge all possible grounds for a trial\ncourt’s ruling that sustains an objection to evidence, then the party waives any\nerror for appellate review. See Gulley v. Davis, 321 S.W.3d 213, 218 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). In his motion to strike the counter-affidavit,\nFavalora challenged Dr. Steiner’s qualifications and argued that the affidavit was\nconclusory. At trial, when the parties were discussing admission of the counter-\n\n                                         37\n\faffidavit, Favalora’s counsel emphasized Dr. Steiner’s lack of qualifications. The\ntrial court granted Favalora’s request to strike the counter-affidavit but did not\nexplicitly state the grounds on which it did so. Katy Springs has not addressed on\nappeal either of Favalora’s contentions below—i.e., that the counter-affidavit is\nconclusory or that Dr. Steiner is not qualified. Because Katy Springs failed to\nchallenge on appeal all the possible grounds for the trial court’s ruling, Katy\nSprings has waived error with respect to the trial court’s striking of Dr. Steiner’s\ncounter-affidavit. See id. Accordingly, we overrule this sub-issue.\n\n       Having overruled each of the sub-issues, we overrule Katy Springs’ fourth\nissue in its entirety.\n\nVI.    IMPROPER JURY ARGUMENT\n       In its fifth issue, Katy Springs complains that Favalora’s counsel’s jury\nargument was improper.\n\n       Katy Springs first argues that counsel’s statements calling for the jury to\npunish the defendant, and ostensibly to award punitive damages, were improper.\nKaty Springs identifies two instances of this type of argument. In the first,\nFavalora’s counsel stated, “You have to decide whether that’s what we want in our\nworkplace, especially industrial - - ”. Katy Springs objected, and the court\nsustained the objection. Favalora’s counsel then changed the subject of his\nargument. In the second instance, Favalora’s counsel stated:\n\n       Imagine yourself walking past the Katy Spring factory and you look\n       in the window and you see a worker having trouble with a dangerous\n       machinery. You watch his supervisor tell his supervisor the worker is\n       not picking it up. You watch the shop superintendent see the same\n       thing. Imagine you see the coil come out, before the time it happened\n       with Joseph, in a dangerous way. Imagine that you see Joseph in a\n       meeting with his boss, telling him, I understand what you’re saying.\n       I’m trying. I don’t get it. Imagine that the boss says, Do it, or you’re\n\n                                         38\n\f      fired. If you’ve got to run to the bathroom, you run to the bathroom\n      and back. Imagine those things are true. What do you do? Do you give\n      him a pass and walk past the door? Do you knock on the door lightly\n      and ask for a donation, hoping that they learned something from it? Or\n      do you kick in the door and you take it, hoping that it acts as a symbol\n      for what they have done?\n\nKaty Springs complains about the last sentence referring to “kick[ing] in the door.”\nAt trial, Katy Springs objected to these statements and asked the trial judge for a\nlimiting instruction. The trial court complied, sustaining the objection and\ninstructing the jury as requested.\n\n      Katy Springs also complains about argument referring to the lack of\nevidence of Favalora’s drug abuse problems. The thrust of the argument here is\nthat Katy Springs had evidence of Favalora’s drug abuse; the court just failed to\nadmit it. Katy Springs objected. Then, in violation of a motion in limine and in\nfront of the jury, Katy Springs’ counsel referred to the heroin evidence that the trial\ncourt had previously excluded. The court then held a bench conference off the\nrecord. After the bench conference, Favalora’s counsel continued his argument but\ndid not mention the drug issue again.\n\n      Finally, Katy Springs complains about Favalora’s counsel’s reference to a\ntrial setting that took place several months before the trial. Katy Springs argues\nthat this gave the jury the impression another trial had taken place. The reference\noccurred in close temporal proximity to the argument regarding Favalora’s drug\nproblems. An off-the-record conference was held after Katy Springs’ counsel\nobjected. After the conference, Favalora’s counsel continued his argument but did\nnot mention the previous trial setting.\n\n      On appeal, Katy Springs contends only that the complained-of jury\narguments were incurable. A jury argument is “incurable” when it is so prejudicial\n\n\n                                          39\n\for inflammatory that an instruction to disregard cannot eliminate the harm. Clark v.\nBres, 217 S.W.3d 501, 509 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet denied).\nTo show an argument is incurable, the complainant must prove: (1) an improper\nargument was made; (2) that was not invited or provoked; (3) that was not curable\nby an instruction, a prompt withdrawal of the statement, or a reprimand by the\ntrial; and (4) that by its nature, degree, and extent, constituted reversibly harmful\nerror based on an examination of the entire record to determine the argument’s\nprobably effect on a material finding. Id. We will consider factors such as whether\nthe argument was repeated or abandoned and whether there was cumulative error.\nId. The complainant must show the probability that the improper argument caused\nharm is greater than the probability that the verdict was grounded on proper\nproceedings and evidence. Id.\n\n      Improper jury argument results in incurable harm only in rare instances,\nsuch as an appeal to racial prejudice, calling someone a liar or a fraud, or by\nmaking an unsupported charge of perjury. UMLIC VP LLC, v. T & M Sales &\nEnvtl. Sys., Inc., 176 S.W.3d 595, 617 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2005, pet.\ndenied). The argument must be so inflammatory as to strike at the heart of the\nadversarial process, must appeal to fundamental prejudices, or be sufficiently\nprejudicial to cause a juror of ordinary intelligence to agree to a verdict contrary to\none which he would have agreed to but for the argument. Dunn v. Bank-Tec S., 134\nS.W.3d 315, 323 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2003, no pet.). For instance, a jury\nargument comparing a nursing home to the Nazis who experimented on and killed\nhumans was incurable. Living Ctrs. of Tex., Inc. v. Peñalver, 256 S.W.3d 678,\n681–82 (Tex. 2008). A jury argument stating that the plaintiff, who was from south\nAsia, had committed “judicial terrorism” was incurable when coupled with an\nunsupported reference to “cultural issues” in the case. Showbiz Multimedia, LLC v.\n\n\n                                          40\n\fMountain States Mortg. Ctrs., Inc., 303 S.W.3d 769, 771–72 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). On the other hand, a jury argument comparing the\ndefendants in a negligence case to onlookers who did nothing during the savage\nbeating of a slave was not incurable. 4Front Eng’red Solutions, Inc. v. Rosales, —\nS.W.3d —, No. 13-13-00655-CV, 2015 WL 1182462, at *25–26 (Tex. App.—\nCorpus Christi Mar. 12, 2015, pet. filed).\n\n      None of the arguments made by Favalora’s counsel involve appeals to racial\nprejudice, extreme or personal attacks on the opposing party, unsupported charges\nof perjury, or inflammatory epithets. The alleged improprieties do not rise to the\nlevel of incurable argument. See PopCap Games, Inc. v. MumboJumbo, LLC, 350\nS.W.3d 699, 721 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied); see also McChristian, 449\nS.W.3d at 855–56 (reference to “snake oil” was not incurable). Accordingly, we\noverrule Katy Springs’ fifth issue.\n\nVII. EXCLUSION OF DRUG EVIDENCE & DENIAL               OF   MOTIONS   TO   REOPEN\n     EVIDENCE & FOR MISTRIAL\n      Because they both relate to the trial court’s decision to exclude evidence of\nFavalora’s past drug use, we consider Katy Springs’ sixth and eighth issues\ntogether. Katy Springs complains in its sixth issue that the trial court erred in\nexcluding evidence of Favalora’s past heroin use. Katy Springs offered hospital\nreports as evidence of specific instances when Favalora was taken to the hospital\nafter allegedly overdosing on heroin. According to Katy Springs, if the court had\nadmitted the evidence, then Katy Springs could have used the evidence to impeach\nFavalora’s credibility.\n\n      We review the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence under an\nabuse of discretion standard. Goss v. Hous. Cmty. Newspapers, 252 S.W.3d 652,\n656 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.). Under Texas Rule of\n\n                                         41\n\fEvidence 608(b), “[e]xcept for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, a party may\nnot inquire into or offer extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of the\nwitness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for\ntruthfulness.” Tex. R. Evid. 608(b). Katy Springs offered extrinsic evidence—the\nhospital reports—to prove specific instances of Favalora’s conduct in order to\nattack his credibility. This evidence was inadmissible for impeachment purposes.\nSee, e.g., TXI Transp. Co. v. Hughes, 306 S.W.3d 230, 242 (Tex. 2010) (evidence\nof plaintiff’s immigration status was inadmissible under rule 608(b)). The trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\n\n      In its eighth issue, Katy Springs asserts that the trial court erred in denying\nits Motion to Reopen Evidence and its Motion for Mistrial. Katy Springs’\nargument on appeal is based on the trial court’s improper exclusion of evidence\npertaining to Favalora’s past abuse of illegal drugs. The question of reopening a\ncase for the purpose of admitting additional evidence is within the sound discretion\nof the judge. Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v. Oechsner, 669\nS.W.2d 364, 366 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1984, no writ). The court’s decision should\nnot be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. Id. Similarly, the trial court’s\ndecision to overrule a motion for mistrial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\nSee Tex. Turnpike Auth. v. McCraw, 458 S.W.2d 911, 913 (Tex. 1970).\n\n      Here, Katy Springs sought to introduce the evidence at issue for the purpose\nof impeaching Favalora. The evidence was not admissible for this purpose.\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\nKaty Springs’ motions. Accordingly, we overrule Katy Springs’ sixth and eighth\nissues.\n\nVIII. JURY CHARGE ERROR\n      In its seventh issue, Katy Springs complains that the trial court improperly\n\n                                         42\n\fincluded instructions that were not supported by evidence and excluded requested\ninstructions. Katy Springs presents its arguments in six sub-issues.\n\n      The entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the first sub-issue consists of\nthe following:\n\n      The Court improperly excluded the instruction “A corporation and all\n      other persons are equal before the law and must be treated as equals in\n      a court of justice. [sic] Appellant timely objected and presented the\n      Court with the proper instruction[.]\n\nThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the third sub-issue consists of the\nfollowing:\n\n      The Court improperly segregated damage elements in Question No. 2\n      and should have listed physical pain and mental anguish as one\n      element and not separate elements of damage[.]\nThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the fourth sub-issue consists of the\nfollowing:\n\n      The Court improperly excluded Appellant’s Requested Instruction No.\n      1 that the mere occurrence of an even causing injury is not evidence\n      of negligence. Appellant provided case law in support of the inclusion\n      of this instruction and it was particularly important given the multiple\n      questionable versions of the alleged incident given by Appellee[.]\n\nThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the fifth sub-issue consists of the\nfollowing:\n\n      The Court improperly excluded Appellant’s Requested Instruction No.\n      2, which was appropriate as the evidence showed that Appellee was\n      performing the same character of work that he had always done and\n      that other employees were required to do[.9]\n\n\n      9\n        The requested instruction reads as follows: “When, at the time of his injury, the\nemployee was doing the same character of work that he had always done and that other\nemployees were required to do the employer was not negligent.”\n\n                                           43\n\fThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the sixth and final sub-issue consists\nof the following:\n\n       The Court improperly excluded Appellant’s Requested Instruction No.\n       3 on mitigation. The evidence at trial supported the inclusion of this\n       instruction and Appellant had preserved the defense.[10]\n\n       Katy Springs does not cite any cases in support of its positions on these sub-\nissues. Nor does Katy Springs analyze how the trial court’s error, if any, was\nharmful. These sub-issues are therefore inadequately briefed. See Tex. R. App. P.\n38.1(i); Canton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931–32; Haas v. George, 71 S.W.3d 904,\n914 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2002, no pet.). By failing to adequately brief these\nsub-issues, Katy Springs has waived them on appeal. Accordingly, we overrule\nthese sub-issues. We turn now to the second sub-issue.\n\n       Katy Springs asserts in the second sub-issue that the trial court erred when it\nincluded the following instruction:\n\n       You are further instructed that Katy Springs & Manufacturing, Inc.\n       also owed duties to provide rules and regulations for an employee’s\n       safety, to furnish safe policies and procedures and to enforce safe\n       policies and procedures.\n\nKaty Springs argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support the\ninclusion of this instruction:\n\n       [Favalora] provided no evidentiary or legal support the inclusion [sic]\n       of this instruction and there was no evidence adduced at trial that any\n       rule, regulation, policy or procedure was involved in the\n       circumstances surrounding [Favalora’s] alleged incident[.]\n\nHowever, at trial, Katy Springs objected to this instruction on different grounds—\n\n       10\n           The requested instruction reads as follows: “Do not include any amount for any\ncondition resulting from the failure, if any, of Joseph Favalora to have acted as a person of\nordinary prudence would have done under the same or similar circumstances in caring for and\ntreating his injuries, if any, that resulted from the occurrence in question.”\n\n                                             44\n\fnamely, that the instruction misstated the law and was a comment on the weight of\nthe evidence:\n\n      Judge, in terms of the instruction, it looks like it’s going to be Page 4\n      on the Charge of the Court where there is your instruction to Katy\n      Springs, also duties to provide rules and regulations for an employee\n      safety to furnish said policy and procedures, to enforce - - and to\n      enforce safe policies and procedures, I don’t think that’s the law. And\n      I think it’s a comment on the weight of the evidence, and we would\n      object to that instruction being included.\n\nTo preserve error for appeal, the argument made below must match the argument\nmade on appeal. Wackenhut Corr. Corp. v. De la Rosa, 305 S.W.3d 594, 616 (Tex.\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2009, no pet.). Here, Katy Springs’ arguments do not match.\nTherefore, Katy Springs preserved nothing for review, and we overrule this sub-\nissue.

A jury found appellant Katy Springs & Manufacturing, Inc. liable\nfor negligence and awarded appellee Joseph Favalora $779,627.02 in\ncompensatory damages. Katy Springs appeals the judgment in eight main issues\nand a number of sub-issues. We modify the trial court’s judgment to delete the\n$100,000 award for future mental anguish and affirm the judgment as modified.\n\fI.    SUMMARY FACTUAL & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n      On October 5, 2010, Favalora was working by himself on a manufacturing\nline producing industrial springs at Katy Springs’ facility in Katy, Texas. During\nhis shift, a bundle of large-gauge wire used to make the springs jammed in a pay-\noff reel that was fabricated by employees at Katy Springs. As Favalora bent down\nto free the jammed wire, the wire began to escape through a three-inch gap at the\ntop of the reel. The escaping wire hit Favalora in the chest, causing him to fall.\nFavalora started to feel pain in his chest and neck. He went to an urgent care\nfacility and was later transferred to Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital where a\ndoctor diagnosed him with a chest contusion, neck sprain, and cervical\nradiculopathy. Following the October 5, 2010 accident, Favalora endured long-\nterm chronic neck pain and numbness in his arm. In 2012, he relocated to\nLouisiana and began consulting with Dr. Bradley Bartholomew, a neurosurgeon.\nEventually, after exhausting conservative pain treatments, including epidural\nsteroid injections and     prescription   pain   medications,   Dr. Bartholomew\nrecommended spinal surgery. In March 2013, Favalora had the surgery, which\nfused his C3-4 and C5-6 vertebrae.\n\n      Favalora sued Katy Springs for negligence. The case went to trial, and the\njury returned a verdict in favor of Favalora. The jury awarded Favalora\n$204,627.02 for past medical expenses; $25,000 for lost earning capacity in the\npast; $81,000 in past physical pain and suffering; $100,000 for future physical pain\nand suffering; $19,000 for past physical impairment; $100,000 for future physical\nimpairment; $150,000 for past mental anguish; and $100,000 for future mental\nanguish. The judgment was signed on December 16, 2013. Katy Springs filed a\nmotion for new trial, which was denied by the trial court in an order dated\nFebruary 24, 2014. Katy Springs timely appealed. Katy Springs appeals the\n\n                                          2\n\fjudgment in eight main issues and a number of sub-issues, which we summarize\nhere:\n\n        1. The evidence is legally and factually insufficient to sustain the\n           jury’s finding on negligence.\n        2. The evidence shows that Favalora was the sole cause of his\n           injuries.\n        3. The evidence is (1) legally insufficient to sustain the jury’s award\n           for past medical expenses; (2) legally insufficient to sustain the\n           jury’s awards for past and future mental anguish; and (3) legally\n           and factually insufficient to sustain the jury’s awards for past and\n           future physical impairment.\n        4. The trial court erred in admitting evidence of Favalora’s damages\n           because (1) the admission of the full amounts of Favalora’s\n           medical bills rather than the amounts received by the providers\n           from a third party violated Civil Practice and Remedies Code\n           section 41.0105; (2) the affidavits do not comply with Civil\n           Practice and Remedies Code section 18.001; and (3) the trial court\n           should have allowed additional pretrial discovery on the damage\n           amounts. Katy Springs further contends (4) the trial court allowed\n           Favalora to submit duplicative evidence of medical bills; and (5)\n           the trial court erred in striking Katy Springs’ counter-affidavit.\n        5. Favalora’s counsel engaged in improper jury argument that was\n           incurable.\n        6. The trial court erred in excluding evidence of Favalora’s prior\n           illegal drug use.\n        7. The jury charge was “fraught with errors of inclusion and\n           exclusion.”\n        8. The trial court erred in denying Katy Springs’ motion to reopen\n           evidence and motion for new trial.\nWe consider each issue and the related sub-issues in turn.\n\nII.     SUFFICIENCY    OF THE     EVIDENCE     TO   SUPPORT JURY’S FINDING         OF\n        NEGLIGENCE\n        In its first issue Katy Springs contends the evidence is legally and factually\n\n\n                                           3\n\finsufficient to support the jury’s finding of negligence. Katy Springs specifically\nchallenges the jury’s findings on the duty, breach, and causation elements.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n      When an appellant challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence on a\nmatter for which he did not have the burden of proof, he must demonstrate on\nappeal that there is no evidence to support the adverse findings.

Jun. 12, 2015). Therefore, Katy Springs, as Favalora’s\nemployer, had a duty to furnish Favalora with reasonably safe machinery.\n\n      To establish a breach of this duty, Favalora had to prove either that Katy\nSprings did something an ordinarily prudent employer exercising ordinary care\nwould not have done under the circumstances, or that Katy Springs did not do that\nwhich an ordinarily prudent employer would have done in the exercise of ordinary\ncare.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n2007, no pet.). Whether a defendant breached its duty is a question of fact. Id.\n\n      The evidence is legally and factually sufficient to support the jury’s finding\nthat Katy Springs breached its duty to furnish Favalora with reasonably safe\n                                          5\n\fmachinery. At the time of the accident, Katy Springs owned two pay-off reels—the\ncompany-made reel and a “yellow reel” made by Spectral Systems. The company-\nmade reel lacked two safety mechanisms that the yellow reel had: (1) a safety\nbrake intended to prevent creeping of the basket when the machine is stopped, and\n(2) containment arms designed to allow wire to escape only from a particular area,\nknown as the “escapement area.” The steel support arms of the company-made reel\nhad deep gouges that trapped the wire and caused it to build tension with each\nrevolution. Instead of containment arms to prevent wire from escaping, the top of\nthe company-made reel had a three-inch gap that allowed the tensioned wire to\nescape in a 360-degree pattern.\n\n      The jury heard testimony from several of Katy Springs’ employees. These\nemployees generally agreed that Favalora should “run away” if the wire started\nescaping from the three-inch gap after having become trapped by the gouges. The\nemployees confirmed that wire had escaped from the reel in the past. Favalora\ntestified that wire escaped from the company-made reel twice during his shift on\nOctober 4, 2010. Despite these concerns, Katy Springs made no effort to repair or\nchange the design of the company-made reel.\n\n      Based on the testimony and evidence, reasonable jurors could have\nconcluded that Katy Springs did not act as a reasonable employer when it allowed\nFavalora to work on the company-made reel that lacked any safety features and\nwas recognized as being unsafe by several Katy Springs employees. The evidence\nfurnishes some reasonable basis for fair-minded people to reach the conclusion that\nKaty Springs breached its duty to provide Favalora with reasonably safe\nmachinery. Furthermore, based on our review of the entire record, the evidence\nsupporting the jury’s finding that Katy Springs breached its duty is not so weak,\nand the evidence to the contrary is not so overwhelming, that the finding should be\n\n                                         6\n\fset aside. Therefore, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\njury’s finding that Katy Springs breached its duty to provide Favalora with\nreasonably safe machinery.

To establish\nforeseeability, the plaintiff must show that the defendant should have anticipated\nthe dangers that its negligent act or omission created for others. Id. Foreseeability\nrequires only that the general danger, not the exact sequence of events that\nproduced the harm, be foreseeable. Id.\n\n       The test for cause in fact is whether the negligent act or omission was a\nsubstantial factor in bringing about the injury, without which the harm would not\nhave occurred. Id. at 266. The plaintiff must prove cause in fact with evidence of\nprobative force. Id. Cause in fact is not shown if the defendant’s negligence did no\nmore than furnish a condition that made the injury possible. Id. Instead, the\nevidence must show that the negligence was the proximate, not the remote, cause\nof the injuries and justify the conclusion that the injury was the natural probable\nresult. Id.\n\n       Generally, the issue of proximate cause is a question of fact. Id. It can be a\nquestion of law in potentially two situations: (1) when the evidence is without\nmaterial dispute and where only one reasonable inference may be drawn, and (2)\n\n                                          7\n\fwhen the relationship between the plaintiff’s injuries and the defendant’s\nnegligence is attenuated or remote.

Katy Springs built the\ncompany-made reel from which the wire escaped. The wire escaped because of the\ngouges in the support arms, which trapped the wire and allowed it to build tension,\nand the three-inch gap at the top of the reel, which allowed the tensioned wire to\nescape the confines of the company-made reel. When the wire escaped on October\n5, 2010, it impacted Favalora and caused him to fall. The jury could have\nconcluded from this evidence that Katy Springs’ failure to provide Favalora with\nreasonably safe machinery was a substantial factor in his fall, one without which\nhis fall would not have occurred. See, e.g., Nw. Mall, Inc. v. Lubri-Lon Int’l, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1531293\"><a href=\"/opinion/1531293/northwest-mall-inc-v-lubri-lon-intern/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">797</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 803 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.).\n\n      The evidence also supports a conclusion that Favalora’s injuries were\nforeseeable. Katy Springs was aware that the company-made reel posed a safety\nhazard. The company’s training program included the instruction to “run away” if\nthe wire began to escape from the company-made reel. The company-made reel\nhad deep gouges that caused the wire to build tension during operation. An\nemployee testified that wire had escaped from the gap on at least two prior\noccasions. Favalora testified that wire had escaped twice since he started working\nat Katy Springs. The jury could have concluded from this evidence that Katy\nSprings should have anticipated the dangers that its company-made reel posed. See,\ne.g., Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt.

During his testimony the following exchange occurred:\n\n                                         9\n\f      [Favalora’s counsel]: Do you believe that Joseph [Favalora], based on\n      what he’s told you, was injured at that time?\n      [Dr. Bartholomew]: Yes, sir.\n      [Favalora’s counsel]: Based on reasonable medical probability, what\n      is your opinion on what injuries Joseph sustained - - injuries or\n      conditions as a result of that incident [at Katy Springs]?\n      ...\n      [Dr. Bartholomew]: As far as the cervical spine, I think he had an\n      aggravation of a preexisting condition in his neck which caused it to\n      become symptomatic.\n\nThis expert testimony is legally sufficient to support the trial court’s judgment.\nSee, e.g., Wal-Mart Stores Tex., LP v. Crosby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352–53 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied) (doctor’s testimony that defendant’s negligence\nresulted in an aggravation of a preexisting condition was legally sufficient to\nsupport the trial court’s findings on causation).\n\n      Katy Springs also emphasizes that Dr. Bartholomew characterized\nFavalora’s injuries as a worsening of a preexisting condition. It is axiomatic that a\ntortfeasor takes a plaintiff as he finds him. Coates v. Whittington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1562788\"><a href=\"/opinion/1562788/coates-v-whittington/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n752 (Tex. 1988). If a latent condition does not cause pain or suffering, but that\ncondition plus an injury caused such pain, then the injury, and not the latent\ncondition, is the proximate cause. Thompson v. Quarles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1728058\"><a href=\"/opinion/1728058/thompson-v-quarles/\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 329\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Galveston 1956, writ ref’d n.r.e.); see City of Hous. v. Celaya,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston 1965, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Here, as a\nresult of a car accident several years before the accident at Katy Springs, Favalora\nsuffered trauma to his spine that required surgery to fuse his C4-5 vertebrae.\nFavalora testified that it took a long time to recover from the surgery. However, the\nevidence indicates that he had in fact recovered. In the time leading up to the\nincident, Favalora was able to work out and exercise. He taught swim lessons. He\n\n                                          10\n\fplayed volleyball. He worked for his now ex-girlfriend’s father building pools—a\nmanual-labor job that required heavy lifting. He testified that he was essentially\npain free at the time of the accident at Katy Springs. The jury could have found\nfrom this evidence that Favalora’s prior injury was a latent condition that did not\ncause him pain or suffering at the time of the accident. Therefore, the jury could\nhave concluded that the injury, and not the preexisting condition, was the\nproximate cause of Favalora’s harm. See Thompson, 297 S.W.2d at 329.1\n\n       In sum, the evidence of causation furnishes some reasonable basis for fair-\nminded people to reach the conclusion that Katy Springs’ negligence proximately\ncaused Favalora’s injuries. The evidence supporting the jury’s finding that\nFavalora’s injury was caused by Katy Springs’ negligence is not so weak, and the\nevidence to the contrary is not so overwhelming, that the finding should be set\naside. Therefore, the evidence was legally and factually sufficient to support the\njury’s finding that Katy Springs’ breach proximately caused Favalora’s injuries.\n\nIII.   WHETHER FAVALORA’S CONDUCT WAS THE SOLE CAUSE OF HIS INJURIES\n       In its second issue, Katy Springs contends that Favalora was the sole cause\nof his injuries. It asserts that had Favalora turned the lathe off before approaching\nthe reel, the incident would not have happened. Katy Springs further argues that\nFavalora’s testimony was conflicting on this issue.\n\n       1\n         To the extent Katy Springs’ argument has any bearing on the jury’s award for past\nmedical expenses, the jury was instructed: “Do not include any amount for any condition that\nexisted before the occurrence in question, except to the extent, if any, that such other condition\nwas aggravated by any injuries that resulted from the occurrence in question.” The jury is\npresumed to have followed the court’s instructions. Columbia Rio Grande Healthcare, L.P. v.\nHawley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895127\"><a href=\"/opinion/895127/columbia-rio-grande-healthcare-v-hawley/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (Tex. 2009). Katy Springs did not argue and did not point to any\nevidence in the record suggesting that the jury did not follow the instruction. Therefore, we\npresume the jury took Favalora’s prior injury into account when it awarded damages for past\nmedical expenses.\n\n\n                                               11\n\f      In an action by an employee against a nonsubscriber employer, “it is not a\ndefense that: (1) the employee was guilty of contributory negligence; (2) the\nemployee assumed the risk of injury or death; or (3) the injury or death was caused\nby the negligence of a fellow employee.” Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 406.033(a) (West\n2015). Therefore, it does not matter if the plaintiff was negligent or helped cause\nhis own injury, unless his negligence was the sole cause of the injury. Hall v.\nTimmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1533177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1533177/hall-v-timmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254–55 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 1999, no pet.).\n\n      It is the province of the jury to resolve the conflicts in the evidence. City of\nKeller, 168 S.W.3d at 820. When pressed by Katy Springs’ counsel, Favalora made\nclear that he did in fact turn the lathe off before he approached the reel. The jury\ncould have believed Favalora’s testimony and concluded that he was not a cause,\nlet alone the sole cause, of his injuries. Even if the jury did not believe that\nFavalora turned the lathe off, the fact that this allegedly negligent act may have\ncontributed to Favalora’s injury does not avail Katy Springs. As discussed above,\nthe evidence indicates that Katy Springs bore at least some responsibility for the\nincident—it knew of the potential hazard, it assigned a new employee to work on\nthe production line with unsafe machinery, and its failure to provide reasonably\nsafe machinery caused Favalora harm. At most, the evidence pointed out by Katy\nSprings shows Favalora was guilty of contributory negligence, which is not a\ndefense available to nonsubscribers. See Tex. Lab. Code Ann. § 406.033(a). We\noverrule Katy Springs’ second issue.\n\nIV.   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT JURY’S DAMAGE AWARDS\n      In its third issue, Katy Springs challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to\nsupport the jury’s award of damages. In three sub-issues, Katy Springs contends:\n\n      (1) the evidence is legally insufficient to justify the award for past\n          medical expenses;\n\n                                         12\n\f      (2) the evidence is legally insufficient to justify the award for past\n          and future mental anguish; and\n      (3) the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to justify the\n          award for past and future physical impairment.\n\nWe consider each sub-issue in turn.\n\nA.    Past Medical Expenses\n      In its first sub-issue, Katy Springs argues the evidence supporting the jury’s\naward of past medical expenses is legally insufficient. Katy Springs’ argument\nfocuses on the existence of a causal nexus between the event sued upon and the\nplaintiff’s injuries. Katy Springs claims that the only evidence of a compensable\ninjury consists of the medical records submitted by Favalora. According to Katy\nSprings, the medical records are no substitute for expert testimony on causation\nbecause laymen lack the requisite knowledge to understand the intricacies of neck\ninjuries and surgeries. Katy Springs does not claim on appeal that the medical\nexpenses were not reasonable and necessary, and, except to the extent Katy\nSprings raises an issue regarding the erroneous admission of duplicative medical\nbills (an issue we consider in Section V.D below), it has not challenged the amount\nthe jury awarded for past medical expenses. We therefore consider only whether a\ncausal nexus existed between the event sued upon and Favalora’s injuries.\n\n      A plaintiff can recover only for injuries caused by the event made the basis\nof suit. Texarkana Mem’l Hosp., Inc. v. Murdock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1710489\"><a href=\"/opinion/1710489/texarkana-memorial-hosp-inc-v-murdock/\"><span class=\"volume\">946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839–40 (Tex.\n1997). This causal nexus inquiry is “strictly referable to the damages portion of the\nplaintiff’s action.” Morgan, 675 S.W.2d at 732. “Even if the defendant’s liability\nhas been established, proof of this causal nexus is necessary to ascertain the\namount of damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.” Id. The causal nexus must be\nshown by competent evidence. Id. Lay testimony is generally adequate to prove\ncausation when general experience and common sense will enable a layman to\n                                         13\n\fdetermine, with reasonable probability, the causal relationship between the event\nand the condition. Id. at 733. Lay testimony establishing a sequence of events\nproviding a strong, logically traceable connection between the event and the\ncondition is sufficient proof of causation. Id.\n\n      Applying these principles, we conclude there is some evidence to support\nthe jury’s award. The evidence shows that Favalora was in good health prior to\nbeginning his employment at Katy Springs. Favalora was able to do manual labor.\nHe was able to participate in athletic endeavors, such as volleyball, swimming, and\nworking out. He was essentially pain free. After several weeks of working at Katy\nSprings, Favalora’s supervisors assigned him to work on a production line with the\ncompany-made reel. During Favalora’s shift, wire escaped from the company-\nmade reel at a high velocity and struck Favalora in the chest. After the accident,\nFavalora suffered excruciating pain and had to undergo spinal surgery that fused\nseveral of his vertebrae. Dr. Bartholomew stated that the fusion surgery would\npermanently affect Favalora’s ability to participate in certain physical activities\nand that Favalora’s mobility would be permanently limited.\n\n      This evidence establishes a sequence of events from which the trier of fact\nmay infer that the wire escaping from the company-made reel caused Favalora to\nsuffer injury. And, as discussed in Section II.C above, there is ample evidence\nsupporting the jury’s finding that Katy Springs’ negligence aggravated Favalora’s\nearlier injuries and caused him additional injuries. See Crosby, 295 S.W.3d at 353.\nTherefore, we conclude there is some evidence in the record to support the trial\ncourt’s award of damages for past medical expenses. See Morgan, 675 S.W.2d at\n733. We overrule this sub-issue.\n\nB.    Past and Future Mental Anguish\n      In the second sub-issue, Katy Springs contends the evidence is legally\n\n                                          14\n\finsufficient to support the jury’s award for past and future mental anguish.\nQuestion 2 of the trial court’s charge asked what sum of money would fairly and\nreasonably compensate Favalora for his injures, if any, that resulted from the\noccurrence in question. For mental anguish sustained in the past, the jury’s answer\nwas $150,000. For future mental anguish, the jury awarded Favalora $100,000.\n\n1.    Applicable Law\n      Under Texas law, mental anguish damages are recoverable in virtually all\npersonal-injury actions, including negligence actions. City of Tyler v. Likes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (Tex. 1997). However, even when an occurrence is of the type for\nwhich mental anguish damages are recoverable, evidence of the nature, duration,\nand severity of the mental anguish is required. Hancock v. Variyam, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">59</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (Tex. 2013). An award of mental anguish damages will survive a legal\nsufficiency challenge when the plaintiff introduces direct evidence of the nature,\nduration, and severity of his mental anguish, thus establishing a substantial\ndisruption in the plaintiff’s routine.

The\nabsence of direct evidence, especially when it can be supplied or procured by the\nplaintiff, justifies close judicial scrutiny of other evidence on this element of\ndamages. Woodruff, 901 S.W.2d at 444. In the absence of direct evidence, we\napply traditional “no evidence” standards to determine whether the record “reveals\nany evidence of ‘a high degree of mental pain and distress’ that is ‘more than mere\nworry, anxiety, vexation, embarrassment, or anger’ to support any award of\ndamages.” Id. In sum, “mental anguish is only compensable if it causes a\nsubstantial disruption in daily routine or a high degree of mental pain and distress.”\nHancock, 400 S.W.3d at 68 (internal quotation and editorial marks omitted).\n\n      Direct evidence can take the form of the claimant’s own testimony or that of\n\n                                         15\n\fa third party or expert witness.

For instance, as a result of the\n      mental pain, the plaintiff suffers from a myriad of negative emotions;\n      some of these emotions may manifest themselves in such a way as to\n      make it difficult for the plaintiff to eat, sleep, work, socially interact,\n      or carry on any other activity which, until the time of the alleged\n      injury, he or she could accomplish on a day-to-day basis without\n      difficulty.\nDillard Dep’t Store, Inc. v.

In response to a\nquestion about his experiences during the first few weeks after the accident,\nFavalora stated:\n\n      I’m not able to do anything. . . . I didn’t leave my apartment. I didn’t\n      do anything. First of all, I wasn’t making any money, so I was slowly\n      losing everything I owned by the day.

Thank God she was there to take me in\n      because at this point several months after the accident, I basically lost\n      everything. I think I touched on it earlier, I had to sell my car. I had to\n      - - I slowly started selling off pieces of my furniture, my TVs, all that\n      kind of stuff. Eventually I was literally left with a couch and a small\n      TV in my living room. And I could no longer afford to pay the rent.\nAfter he relocated to Louisiana, Favalora started consulting with Dr. Bartholomew.\nIt became apparent to Favalora that he might have to have another surgery. When\ndiscussing this possibility at trial, Favalora stated, “I was not happy about it.” In\n\n                                          18\n\fresponse to a question about his outlook when he started visiting Dr. Bartholomew,\nFavalora stated:\n\n      Well, I already knew I needed surgery. So at this point I was willing -\n      - I had lost the job at G-2 [Partners], lost my apartment once again and\n      lost all of my belongings. At that point I really looked at the surgery\n      in a different way that it was now to me more something that I had to\n      do to be able to get on with my life. Because it was just becoming like\n      a detour, like lingering. And the pain wasn’t going away, all of the\n      alternative treatments had failed.\n\n      Katie Vollmer, Favalora’s then-girlfriend, also testified about Favalora’s\nemotional state. Vollmer described Favalora’s mental state prior to the accident as\n“always smiling” and “always happy.” He was never stressed out even when the\ncouple had financial problems. Favalora was someone she could go to with a\nproblem. After the accident, however, Favalora was “not in a good place”\nemotionally. Vollmer described Favalora as “quiet and sad” and “not himself.”\nVollmer noted that “it was so unlike him to just lay [sic] down or sit down.” “He\ncouldn’t get up and do the things he used to do, and I think that really got to him.”\n\n      On the subject of Favalora’s decision to have surgery, Vollmer testified that\nFavalora was “very optimistic” about the surgery. He was “ready to just feel\nbetter.” And after the surgery, “he was still, I mean, very optimistic about, you\nknow, the outcome and hoping, you know, it will finally make him feel better.”\nVollmer noted that Favalora was improving emotionally after the surgery. “He just\nseems like he’s more up and going and ready to go do things.” He was “getting\nback to himself, you know. He wants to move back here [to the Houston area] and\nfinish school, and he just seems to joke around more and just has more life about\nhim, you know.”\n\n      In contrast to Vollmer’s relatively optimistic perspective of Favalora’s\nmental state, Dr. Bartholomew described Favalora as depressed and recommended\n\n                                          19\n\fthat Favalora seek psychiatric treatment. Responding to a question about how\nFavalora has done since the fusion surgery, Dr. Bartholomew stated, “I recommend\n- - physical therapy is common after a surgery, psychiatric because he’s obviously\ndepressed. And, unfortunately, he’s not done very well. He’s had continuing neck\npain and getting very depressed with it.” Dr. Bartholomew continued:\n\n      He’s depressed, obviously depressed. And we know that pain and\n      depression go hand in hand. And the longer people have pain, the\n      more likely they are to be depressed and the less likely they are to\n      recover without some treatment for their depression.\nExplaining how he knew Favalora was depressed, Dr. Bartholomew stated, “I think\nhe even cried in the office. I mean, he tells me he’s depressed. You can just look at\nhim and talk to him and - - I’m pretty sure he cried in the office.” Later in his\ntestimony, the doctor added, “Yeah. I noted in my note of May 30th, 2013, ‘Even\nalmost crying in the office.’” Doctor Bartholomew explained that depression is\ncommon for people experiencing chronic pain. Discussing Favalora’s future\nprognosis, Doctor Bartholomew testified:\n\n      I think we need to get him, as I recommended, in physical therapy and\n      psychiatric treatment, otherwise he’s going to have a miserable future.\n      He’s already developed depression, basically crying in the office.\n      He’s told me he’s been to the emergency room, not because he had an\n      increase in his pain, just he couldn’t deal with it [the pain], so tired of\n      living with it [the pain]. So I think that, you know, he’s going to\n      become a long-term chronic pain patient. And especially with a\n      psychological overlay from the depression, it’s not a very bright\n      future. That’s why we need to get him into [physical] therapy and get\n      him to a psychiatrist.\n\n3.    Analysis\n      With regard to past mental anguish damages, the evidence does show that, as\na result of the accident, Favalora experienced some level of mental pain separate\nand apart from the physical pain and physical impairment. Whereas before the\n                                          20\n\faccident, Favalora was “always smiling” and “always happy,” after the accident,\nhe was “quiet and sad” and “very depressed.” This evidence shows that Favalora’s\nattitude changed after the incident. Favalora also experienced relationship and\nfinancial struggles after the accident. He and his girlfriend broke up. He was\ncompelled to move in with an aunt because he could no longer pay his bills. He\nultimately had to return to Louisiana as a result of the financial strain. The jury\ncould have inferred from Favalora’s attitudinal changes and the attendant hardships\nthat Favalora had suffered a high degree of mental pain and distress beyond mere\nworry, vexation, embarrassment, or anger. Therefore, the evidence is legally\nsufficient to support the jury’s finding of past mental anguish.\n\n      With regard to future mental anguish, the evidence does not demonstrate a\nreasonable probability that Favalora will suffer compensable mental anguish in the\nfuture. The severity of Favalora’s injury and the evidence of his mental pain\nsimply do not rise to the level of the severity of the injury and the evidence\npropounded in other personal-injury cases. For instance, in Fifth Club, the plaintiff\nhad been severely beaten by a security guard at a club. 196 S.W.3d at 790. He\nsuffered a fractured skull when the guard slammed his head against a concrete wall\nand struck him several times. Id. The plaintiff and his wife testified that he\ncontinued to be depressed, humiliated, non-communicative, unable to sleep, and\nangry. Id. at 797. He continued to have headaches, and his daily activities and\nrelationships with his wife and daughter continued to be detrimentally affected\nnearly two years after the beating. Id. The plaintiff also presented evidence of the\nseverity of the intentional beating, including significant injuries to his head and\nbody, loss of consciousness, and multiple visits to the hospital. Id. This evidence\nwas legally sufficient to support an award for future mental anguish damages\nbecause it showed the nature of the plaintiff’s mental anguish, its lasting duration,\n\n\n                                          21\n\fand the severity of his injuries. Id. at 797–98.2\n\n       In contrast, the only evidence in the record concerning Favalora’s future\nmental anguish—separate and apart from the evidence related to Favalora’s pain\nand suffering and physical impairment—was Dr. Bartholomew’s testimony that\nFavalora was “very depressed.” Although the words “very depressed” can imply\nmore than mere worry, anxiety, embarrassment, or anger, we must look at the\ntotality of the circumstances as well as the words used. See Carey, 894 S.W.2d at\n58. Here, the doctor’s conclusions—that Favalora was very depressed and could\nlook forward to a bleak future unless he received psychiatric treatment—are not\nspecific evidence of the lasting nature, severity, and duration of Favalora’s future\nmental anguish.

He explained that he could no longer work out or engage in\nother physical activities he had enjoyed in the past. Dr. Bartholomew testified that\nas a result of the double-fusion surgery, Favalora would lose between fifteen and\nthirty percent of the range of motion in his neck. According to the doctor, this loss\nof range of motion would make simple tasks, such as descending a staircase,\ndifficult because Favalora will not be able to move his head enough to see his feet.\nAdditionally, Favalora will be unable to lift heavy weights, which will necessarily\ncurtail his ability to work out, an activity he enjoyed before the accident.

Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode Ann. § 41.0105 (West 2015). The Texas Supreme Court construed this\nprovision in Haygood and held that “this statute limits recovery, and consequently\nthe evidence at trial, to expenses that the [medical] provider has a legal right to be\npaid.” 356 S.W.3d at 391. In Haygood, a personal-injury case arising from a car\naccident, twelve health care providers billed Haygood a total of $110,069.12.\nBecause Haygood was covered by Medicare Part B and pursuant to federal law\nprohibiting providers from charging patients more than Medicare deemed\nreasonable, Haygood’s health care providers adjusted their bills downward, leaving\na total amount due of $27,739.43. The trial court allowed Haygood to introduce\nevidence of the full amounts billed by his providers, and the jury awarded the full\namounts as past medical expenses. The court of appeals reversed. Id. at 392. In\naffirming the court of appeals, the Texas Supreme Court first concluded that the\ncollateral source rule, which precludes a reduction in a tortfeasor’s liability\nbecause of benefits received by the plaintiff from someone else, does not allow a\n\n                                         27\n\fplaintiff to recover medical expenses that a health care provider is not entitled to\ncharge. Id. at 396. Addressing section 41.0105, the court first reasoned that\n“actually paid and incurred” means “expenses that have been or will be paid, and\nexcludes the difference between such amount and charges the [medical] service\nprovider bills but has no right to be paid.” Id. at 397. Accordingly, the court held\nthat section 41.0105 “limits a claimant’s recovery of medical expenses to those\nwhich have been or must be paid by or for the claimant.” Id. at 398. The court next\nconsidered whether the evidence showing the full amounts billed by the health care\nproviders was nonetheless admissible. Because a claimant cannot recover medical\nexpenses that the medical provider is not entitled to be paid, the court reasoned that\nevidence of such medical expenses is irrelevant to the issue of damages and that\nthe probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the confusion it\nis likely to generate. Id. Therefore, only evidence of recoverable medical expenses\nis admissible at trial, where “recoverable medical expenses” means those expenses\nthat “have been or must be paid by or for the claimant.” Id. at 398–399.\n\n      The factual situation before us does not fit neatly into section 41.0105 or the\nHaygood court’s ruling. However, the Dallas Court of Appeals’ decision in Big\nBird Tree Service v. Gallegos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548539\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548539/big-bird-tree-services-v-gallegos/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet.\ndenied), is informative. In Gallegos, an indigent plaintiff received valuable medical\nservices from Parkland Hospital free of charge. 365 S.W.3d at 175. To prove his\nreasonable and necessary medical expenses, the plaintiff relied on affidavits with\nattached billing records from UT Southwestern and Parkland hospitals. The\namounts charged totaled $67,699.41 and $16,659.50 respectively. The jury\nawarded the plaintiff damages, including those incurred at Parkland. The defendant\nargued on appeal that the evidence was legally and factually insufficient to support\nthe award of expenses for services received at Parkland because the plaintiff\n\n\n                                         28\n\freceived the services free of charge. Id. In an offer of proof, Parkland’s custodian\nof records testified that if Parkland discovered that the patient was able to pay for\nthe services, then the patient would be billed for the services. Id. at 175–76. The\nevidence therefore indicated that the plaintiff would be required to pay if he were\nto obtain a recovery in a lawsuit or otherwise acquire the funds.\n\n      The Dallas court distinguished Haygood. First, the court noted that there was\nno evidence of any contract that would have prohibited the hospitals from charging\nthe plaintiff for the full value of the services rendered. Id. at 177. Second, the court\nemphasized that the plaintiff remained liable for the services rendered if he were to\nrecover the funds by other means. Id. The court then concluded that section\n41.0105 did not preclude the plaintiff from recovering. Id.\n\n      The facts of this case are similar to those of Gallegos. Favalora is uninsured\nand received valuable medical services. At the time of trial, Favalora had not paid\nfor those services. He testified to owing in excess of $200,000 in medical\nexpenses. The evidence attached to the parties’ respective motions on this issue,\nwhich the trial court considered in rendering its decision, shows that Favalora\nentered into contracts with several of his health care providers. Pursuant to these\ncontracts, Favalora assigned to the health care providers his interest in any\nproceeds that might be recovered as a result of his pending lawsuit. Favalora also\ngranted the providers a security interest in his potential tort recovery. MedStar then\npurchased, at a discount, the health care providers’ accounts receivable, including\nthe providers’ respective interests in the potential tort recovery and the liens on\nthose interests. Just as in Gallegos, there is no evidence of any contract that\nprohibited the health care providers from charging Favalora the full value of the\nservices rendered. Nor is there any evidence of a contract prohibiting MedStar\nfrom collecting the full value of the services rendered. To the contrary, the\n\n                                          29\n\fevidence considered by the trial court suggests that Favalora remained liable for\nthe full value of the services rendered.\n\n      The fact that the indigent plaintiff in Gallegos received the services free of\ncharge from a charitable organization does not change our conclusion that the\nobjected-to evidence was admissible. The evidence here, as in Gallegos, indicates\nthat the expenses must be paid by Favalora. Therefore, we cannot conclude that\nMedStar, by way of the medical providers, was not entitled to recover the full\nvalue of the services rendered. See Gallegos, 365 S.W.3d at 177; see also Cash v.\nCeladon Trucking Servs., Inc., No. 4:13-CV-461, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1381394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (S.D.\nTex. Apr. 7, 2014) (unpublished memorandum and order; finding erroneous\ndefendant’s interpretation of section 41.0105 that would limit plaintiff’s recovery\nto amount paid by factor). Consequently, the evidence showing the full value of the\nservices received by Favalora was admissible. See Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 399.\n\n      Katy Springs has pointed out the following sentence from this court’s\nopinion in McChristian: “A tortfeasor is not liable for medical expenses that the\nclaimant is not required to pay to the provider because allowing such a recovery\nwould bestow a windfall.” 449 S.W.3d at 852 (emphasis added); see also\nHaygood, 356 S.W.3d at 397 (“[A] tortfeasor is not liable to a health care provider\nor its patients for medical expenses the patients were not required to pay the\nprovider.” (emphasis added)). Focusing on the phrase “pay to the provider,” Katy\nSprings reasons that if the medical provider is no longer entitled to be paid, then\nthe claimant cannot recover the full amount of the medical expenses from the\ntortfeasor but must settle for the discounted amount received by the provider.\nAccording to Katy Springs, because Favalora’s medical providers were paid, albeit\nby a third party that purchased the right to collect the outstanding accounts\nreceivable, Favalora cannot recover the full amount from Katy Springs. We reject\n\n                                           30\n\fKaty Springs’ position, and we conclude that its reliance on Haygood and\nMcChristian is misplaced because those cases involved distinguishable\ncircumstances.\n\n      The circumstances here involve a factoring arrangement; Haygood and\nMcChristian did not. Haygood addressed section 41.0105’s applicability to\nexpenses for necessary medical care charged by health care providers who set\ncharges at a higher level but agreed to be reimbursed by insurers at a lower level\ndeemed to be reasonable based on “customary charges for similar services and\nprevailing charges in the same locality for similar services.” Haygood, 356 S.W.3d\nat 392 & n.7. McChristian addressed section 41.0105’s applicability to expenses\nfor necessary medical care that were provided to an uninsured plaintiff.\nMcChristian, 449 S.W.3d at 854. “As the supreme court explained, section\n41.0105 addresses the difficulty in determining reasonable expenses for necessary\nmedical care when ‘[h]ealth care providers set charges they maintain are\nreasonable while agreeing to reimbursement at much lower rates determined by\ninsurers to be reasonable, resulting in great disparities between amounts billed and\npayments accepted.’” Id. (quoting Haygood, 356 S.W.3d at 391). This case does\nnot require us to address the disparity between higher charges set by medical\nproviders and lower “reasonable” reimbursement rates set by insurers.\n\n      This situation, in contrast, involves medical expenses that Favalora is\ncontractually obligated to pay in full. MedStar is the contractual assignee of\nFavalora’s medical providers. Katy Springs’ position ignores the longstanding\nprinciple that “an assignee under Texas common law stands in the shoes of his\nassignor.” See Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Marketing on Hold Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895197\"><a href=\"/opinion/895197/southwestern-bell-v-marketing-on-hold/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 920\n(Tex. 2010). In so doing, the assignee “receives the full rights of the assignor.”\nJackson v. Thweatt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525157\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525157/jackson-v-thweatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174 (Tex. 1994). Because MedStar holds\n\n                                        31\n\fcontractually valid assignments, MedStar “steps into the shoes” of the medical\nproviders and is considered under the law to “have the same ability to pursue the\nclaims” of the medical providers. See Marketing on Hold, 308 S.W.3d at 916.\nTherefore, under Texas law and by virtue of the assignments, MedStar and the\nmedical providers are one and the same for purposes of determining the\nadmissibility of evidence under section 41.0105 and Haygood.\n\n        In a factoring case, where the record indicates that the claimant remains\nliable for the amounts originally billed by the medical provider, such amounts are\nrecoverable medical expenses under section 41.0105, and evidence showing the\namounts billed by the medical provider is admissible. Accordingly, we overrule\nthis sub-issue.\n\nB.      Compliance with section 18.001, Civil Practice & Remedies Code\n        Katy Springs next contends Favalora’s Exhibits 39, 41, 43, 49, 51, 52, 53,\nand 60 do not comply with section 18.001 of the Civil Practice and Remedies\nCode.\n\n        Section 18.001 is “purely procedural, providing for the use of affidavits to\nstreamline proof of the reasonableness and necessity of medical expenses.”\nHaygood, 356 S.W.3d at 397.\n\n        [A]n affidavit that the amount a person charged for a service was\n        reasonable at the time and place that the service was provided and that\n        the service was necessary is sufficient evidence to support a finding of\n        fact by judge or jury that the amount charged was reasonable or that\n        the service was necessary.\n\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 18.001(b) (West 2015).\n\n        The affidavit must:\n        (1) be taken before an officer with authority to administer oaths;\n        (2) be made by:\n                                           32\n\f         (A) the person who provided the service; or\n         (B) the person in charge of records showing the service provided\n         and charge made; and\n      (3) include an itemized statement of the service and charge.\n\nId. § 18.001(c). In other words, to comply with section 18.001, an affidavit must:\n(1) state that the amount charged was reasonable; (2) state that the service was\nnecessary; (3) be taken before an officer with authority to administer oaths; (4) be\nmade by the provider or the person in charge of the records showing the service\nprovided; and (5) include an itemized statement of the service and charge. See id. §\n18.001; see also id. § 18.002 (West 2015) (sample affidavit forms).\n\n      Here, the challenged exhibits contain affidavits that comply with all of the\nsection 18.001 requirements. However, Katy Springs has emphasized that Dan\nChristensen, the person who signed the MedStar affidavit, which the trial court\nadmitted as Exhibit 60, was not a “medical provider” and therefore was not\nqualified to testify regarding the reasonableness of the charges. Katy Springs\nmischaracterizes the text of section 18.001, which contains the disjunctive “or”\nbetween the phrase, “the person who provided the service,” and the phrase, “the\nperson in charge of records showing the service provided and charge made.” Katy\nSprings has not identified, and we have not found in the record, any evidence\nsuggesting that Christensen is not the person in charge of the records showing the\nservices provided. In fact, the evidence considered by the court in making its\nevidentiary rulings suggests the opposite. The contracts between MedStar and the\nservice providers explicitly made MedStar the custodian of the pertinent records.\n\n      We overrule this sub-issue.\n\nC.    Refusal to Permit Pretrial Discovery on MedStar\n      Katy Springs contends the trial court erred in “refusing to allow pretrial\n\n                                        33\n\fdiscovery necessary for [it] to verify the accuracy of amounts stated in medical\nbilling affidavits submitted by [Favalora.]” This statement constitutes the entirety\nof Katy Springs’ argument regarding the trial court’s decision on Katy Springs’\nrequest for additional discovery. Katy Springs has not cited to any legal authority\nfor the appropriate standards on discovery error. Nor has it cited to authority or\nexplained how the trial court’s error, if any, was harmful. Accordingly, we\nconclude this issue is inadequately briefed. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1; Canton-\nCarter v. Baylor Coll. of Med., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1764121\"><a href=\"/opinion/1764121/canton-carter-v-baylor-college-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931–32 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.). By failing to adequately brief this sub-issue, Katy\nSprings has waived it on appeal. We overrule this sub-issue.\n\nD.    Admission of Duplicative Affidavits and Medical Bills\n      Katy Springs contends the trial court erred by admitting multiple affidavits\nfor the same medical expenses. Specifically, Katy Springs claims that some\ncharges are covered by both an affidavit from the medical provider and the\naffidavit submitted by MedStar’s Christensen. Our review of the record confirms\nKaty Springs’ claim that some of the medical bills were submitted twice. For\nexample, in Exhibit 39, Nicole Lilly testified by affidavit on behalf of TOPS\nSurgical Hospital that Favalora still owed $11,482.97. Lilly attached an itemized\nbill to her affidavit. Christensen attached the same itemized bill to the MedStar\naffidavit, which was admitted as Exhibit 60. We conclude, however, that the trial\ncourt’s error, if any, was harmless.\n\n      The admission and exclusion of evidence are within the sound discretion of\nthe trial court. Bayer Corp. v. DX Terminals, Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1403766\"><a href=\"/opinion/1403766/bayer-corp-v-dx-terminals-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 609 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet. denied). The complaining party must show\nthat the trial court erred and that the error probably resulted in an improper\njudgment, which usually requires a showing that the judgment turned on the\n\n                                        34\n\fchallenged evidence. Id.\n\n       The evidence in this case indicates that the jury did not consider the\nduplicated bills when it determined the amount of past medical expenses to award\nFavalora. The jury awarded Favalora $204,627.02 for past medical expenses.

App.—Dallas 2014, pet. filed). “It is not this court’s duty to review the\nrecord, research the law, and then fashion a legal argument for appellant when [it]\nhas failed to do so.” Canton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931–32; see Cruz, 452 S.W.3d\nat 511 (“We have no duty, or even right, to perform an independent review of the\nrecord and applicable law to determine whether there was error.”). Katy Springs\ndid not cite any legal authority or provide any analysis applying the appropriate\nlegal authority to the facts of its case in such a manner as to demonstrate the trial\ncourt committed reversible error when it excluded the counter-affidavit. See\nCanton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931.\n\n      Even if this issue were adequately briefed, Katy Springs waived any error\nfor appellate review. If a party does not challenge all possible grounds for a trial\ncourt’s ruling that sustains an objection to evidence, then the party waives any\nerror for appellate review. See Gulley v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2278111\"><a href=\"/opinion/2278111/gulley-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2010, pet. denied). In his motion to strike the counter-affidavit,\nFavalora challenged Dr. Steiner’s qualifications and argued that the affidavit was\nconclusory. At trial, when the parties were discussing admission of the counter-\n\n                                         37\n\faffidavit, Favalora’s counsel emphasized Dr. Steiner’s lack of qualifications. The\ntrial court granted Favalora’s request to strike the counter-affidavit but did not\nexplicitly state the grounds on which it did so. Katy Springs has not addressed on\nappeal either of Favalora’s contentions below—i.e., that the counter-affidavit is\nconclusory or that Dr. Steiner is not qualified. Because Katy Springs failed to\nchallenge on appeal all the possible grounds for the trial court’s ruling, Katy\nSprings has waived error with respect to the trial court’s striking of Dr. Steiner’s\ncounter-affidavit. See id. Accordingly, we overrule this sub-issue.\n\n       Having overruled each of the sub-issues, we overrule Katy Springs’ fourth\nissue in its entirety.\n\nVI.    IMPROPER JURY ARGUMENT\n       In its fifth issue, Katy Springs complains that Favalora’s counsel’s jury\nargument was improper.\n\n       Katy Springs first argues that counsel’s statements calling for the jury to\npunish the defendant, and ostensibly to award punitive damages, were improper.\nKaty Springs identifies two instances of this type of argument. In the first,\nFavalora’s counsel stated, “You have to decide whether that’s what we want in our\nworkplace, especially industrial - - ”. Katy Springs objected, and the court\nsustained the objection. Favalora’s counsel then changed the subject of his\nargument. In the second instance, Favalora’s counsel stated:\n\n       Imagine yourself walking past the Katy Spring factory and you look\n       in the window and you see a worker having trouble with a dangerous\n       machinery. You watch his supervisor tell his supervisor the worker is\n       not picking it up. You watch the shop superintendent see the same\n       thing. Imagine you see the coil come out, before the time it happened\n       with Joseph, in a dangerous way. Imagine that you see Joseph in a\n       meeting with his boss, telling him, I understand what you’re saying.\n       I’m trying. I don’t get it. Imagine that the boss says, Do it, or you’re\n\n                                         38\n\f      fired. If you’ve got to run to the bathroom, you run to the bathroom\n      and back. Imagine those things are true. What do you do? Do you give\n      him a pass and walk past the door? Do you knock on the door lightly\n      and ask for a donation, hoping that they learned something from it? Or\n      do you kick in the door and you take it, hoping that it acts as a symbol\n      for what they have done?\n\nKaty Springs complains about the last sentence referring to “kick[ing] in the door.”\nAt trial, Katy Springs objected to these statements and asked the trial judge for a\nlimiting instruction. The trial court complied, sustaining the objection and\ninstructing the jury as requested.\n\n      Katy Springs also complains about argument referring to the lack of\nevidence of Favalora’s drug abuse problems. The thrust of the argument here is\nthat Katy Springs had evidence of Favalora’s drug abuse; the court just failed to\nadmit it. Katy Springs objected. Then, in violation of a motion in limine and in\nfront of the jury, Katy Springs’ counsel referred to the heroin evidence that the trial\ncourt had previously excluded. The court then held a bench conference off the\nrecord. After the bench conference, Favalora’s counsel continued his argument but\ndid not mention the drug issue again.\n\n      Finally, Katy Springs complains about Favalora’s counsel’s reference to a\ntrial setting that took place several months before the trial. Katy Springs argues\nthat this gave the jury the impression another trial had taken place. The reference\noccurred in close temporal proximity to the argument regarding Favalora’s drug\nproblems. An off-the-record conference was held after Katy Springs’ counsel\nobjected. After the conference, Favalora’s counsel continued his argument but did\nnot mention the previous trial setting.\n\n      On appeal, Katy Springs contends only that the complained-of jury\narguments were incurable. A jury argument is “incurable” when it is so prejudicial\n\n\n                                          39\n\for inflammatory that an instruction to disregard cannot eliminate the harm.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, pet denied).\nTo show an argument is incurable, the complainant must prove: (1) an improper\nargument was made; (2) that was not invited or provoked; (3) that was not curable\nby an instruction, a prompt withdrawal of the statement, or a reprimand by the\ntrial; and (4) that by its nature, degree, and extent, constituted reversibly harmful\nerror based on an examination of the entire record to determine the argument’s\nprobably effect on a material finding. Id. We will consider factors such as whether\nthe argument was repeated or abandoned and whether there was cumulative error.\nId. The complainant must show the probability that the improper argument caused\nharm is greater than the probability that the verdict was grounded on proper\nproceedings and evidence. Id.\n\n      Improper jury argument results in incurable harm only in rare instances,\nsuch as an appeal to racial prejudice, calling someone a liar or a fraud, or by\nmaking an unsupported charge of perjury.

App.—Houston\n[1st Dist.] 2009, no pet.). On the other hand, a jury argument comparing the\ndefendants in a negligence case to onlookers who did nothing during the savage\nbeating of a slave was not incurable. 4Front Eng’red Solutions, Inc. v. Rosales, —\nS.W.3d —, No. 13-13-00655-CV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1182462</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *25–26 (Tex. App.—\nCorpus Christi Mar. 12, 2015, pet. filed).\n\n      None of the arguments made by Favalora’s counsel involve appeals to racial\nprejudice, extreme or personal attacks on the opposing party, unsupported charges\nof perjury, or inflammatory epithets. The alleged improprieties do not rise to the\nlevel of incurable argument. See PopCap Games, Inc. v. MumboJumbo, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2537932\"><a href=\"/opinion/2537932/popcap-games-inc-v-mumbojumbo-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 721 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied); see also McChristian, 449\nS.W.3d at 855–56 (reference to “snake oil” was not incurable). Accordingly, we\noverrule Katy Springs’ fifth issue.\n\nVII. EXCLUSION OF DRUG EVIDENCE & DENIAL               OF   MOTIONS   TO   REOPEN\n     EVIDENCE & FOR MISTRIAL\n      Because they both relate to the trial court’s decision to exclude evidence of\nFavalora’s past drug use, we consider Katy Springs’ sixth and eighth issues\ntogether. Katy Springs complains in its sixth issue that the trial court erred in\nexcluding evidence of Favalora’s past heroin use. Katy Springs offered hospital\nreports as evidence of specific instances when Favalora was taken to the hospital\nafter allegedly overdosing on heroin. According to Katy Springs, if the court had\nadmitted the evidence, then Katy Springs could have used the evidence to impeach\nFavalora’s credibility.\n\n      We review the trial court’s decision to admit or exclude evidence under an\nabuse of discretion standard. Goss v. Hous. Cmty. Newspapers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1384471\"><a href=\"/opinion/1384471/goss-v-houston-community-newspapers/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n656 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.). Under Texas Rule of\n\n                                         41\n\fEvidence 608(b), “[e]xcept for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, a party may\nnot inquire into or offer extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of the\nwitness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for\ntruthfulness.” Tex. R. Evid. 608(b). Katy Springs offered extrinsic evidence—the\nhospital reports—to prove specific instances of Favalora’s conduct in order to\nattack his credibility. This evidence was inadmissible for impeachment purposes.\nSee, e.g., TXI Transp. Co. v. Hughes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895202\"><a href=\"/opinion/895202/txi-transp-co-v-hughes/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (Tex. 2010) (evidence\nof plaintiff’s immigration status was inadmissible under rule 608(b)). The trial\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in excluding the evidence.\n\n      In its eighth issue, Katy Springs asserts that the trial court erred in denying\nits Motion to Reopen Evidence and its Motion for Mistrial. Katy Springs’\nargument on appeal is based on the trial court’s improper exclusion of evidence\npertaining to Favalora’s past abuse of illegal drugs. The question of reopening a\ncase for the purpose of admitting additional evidence is within the sound discretion\nof the judge. Word of Faith World Outreach Ctr. Church, Inc. v. Oechsner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1786996\"><a href=\"/opinion/1786996/word-of-faith-world-outreach-v-oechsner/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 366 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1984, no writ). The court’s decision should\nnot be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. Id. Similarly, the trial court’s\ndecision to overrule a motion for mistrial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\nSee Tex. Turnpike Auth. v. McCraw, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 913 (Tex. 1970).\n\n      Here, Katy Springs sought to introduce the evidence at issue for the purpose\nof impeaching Favalora. The evidence was not admissible for this purpose.\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\nKaty Springs’ motions. Accordingly, we overrule Katy Springs’ sixth and eighth\nissues.\n\nVIII. JURY CHARGE ERROR\n      In its seventh issue, Katy Springs complains that the trial court improperly\n\n                                         42\n\fincluded instructions that were not supported by evidence and excluded requested\ninstructions. Katy Springs presents its arguments in six sub-issues.\n\n      The entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the first sub-issue consists of\nthe following:\n\n      The Court improperly excluded the instruction “A corporation and all\n      other persons are equal before the law and must be treated as equals in\n      a court of justice. [sic] Appellant timely objected and presented the\n      Court with the proper instruction[.]\n\nThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the third sub-issue consists of the\nfollowing:\n\n      The Court improperly segregated damage elements in Question No. 2\n      and should have listed physical pain and mental anguish as one\n      element and not separate elements of damage[.]\nThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the fourth sub-issue consists of the\nfollowing:\n\n      The Court improperly excluded Appellant’s Requested Instruction No.\n      1 that the mere occurrence of an even causing injury is not evidence\n      of negligence. Appellant provided case law in support of the inclusion\n      of this instruction and it was particularly important given the multiple\n      questionable versions of the alleged incident given by Appellee[.]\n\nThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the fifth sub-issue consists of the\nfollowing:\n\n      The Court improperly excluded Appellant’s Requested Instruction No.\n      2, which was appropriate as the evidence showed that Appellee was\n      performing the same character of work that he had always done and\n      that other employees were required to do[.9]\n\n\n      9\n        The requested instruction reads as follows: “When, at the time of his injury, the\nemployee was doing the same character of work that he had always done and that other\nemployees were required to do the employer was not negligent.”\n\n                                           43\n\fThe entirety of Katy Springs’ contentions on the sixth and final sub-issue consists\nof the following:\n\n       The Court improperly excluded Appellant’s Requested Instruction No.\n       3 on mitigation. The evidence at trial supported the inclusion of this\n       instruction and Appellant had preserved the defense.[10]\n\n       Katy Springs does not cite any cases in support of its positions on these sub-\nissues. Nor does Katy Springs analyze how the trial court’s error, if any, was\nharmful. These sub-issues are therefore inadequately briefed. See Tex. R. App. P.\n38.1(i); Canton-Carter, 271 S.W.3d at 931–32; Haas v. George, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1662197\"><a href=\"/opinion/1662197/haas-v-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n914 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2002, no pet.). By failing to adequately brief these\nsub-issues, Katy Springs has waived them on appeal. Accordingly, we overrule\nthese sub-issues. We turn now to the second sub-issue.\n\n       Katy Springs asserts in the second sub-issue that the trial court erred when it\nincluded the following instruction:\n\n       You are further instructed that Katy Springs & Manufacturing, Inc.\n       also owed duties to provide rules and regulations for an employee’s\n       safety, to furnish safe policies and procedures and to enforce safe\n       policies and procedures.\n\nKaty Springs argues on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to support the\ninclusion of this instruction:\n\n       [Favalora] provided no evidentiary or legal support the inclusion [sic]\n       of this instruction and there was no evidence adduced at trial that any\n       rule, regulation, policy or procedure was involved in the\n       circumstances surrounding [Favalora’s] alleged incident[.]\n\nHowever, at trial, Katy Springs objected to this instruction on different grounds—\n\n       10\n           The requested instruction reads as follows: “Do not include any amount for any\ncondition resulting from the failure, if any, of Joseph Favalora to have acted as a person of\nordinary prudence would have done under the same or similar circumstances in caring for and\ntreating his injuries, if any, that resulted from the occurrence in question.”\n\n                                             44\n\fnamely, that the instruction misstated the law and was a comment on the weight of\nthe evidence:\n\n      Judge, in terms of the instruction, it looks like it’s going to be Page 4\n      on the Charge of the Court where there is your instruction to Katy\n      Springs, also duties to provide rules and regulations for an employee\n      safety to furnish said policy and procedures, to enforce - - and to\n      enforce safe policies and procedures, I don’t think that’s the law. And\n      I think it’s a comment on the weight of the evidence, and we would\n      object to that instruction being included.\n\nTo preserve error for appeal, the argument made below must match the argument\nmade on appeal. Wackenhut Corr. Corp. v. De la Rosa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2187114\"><a href=\"/opinion/2187114/wackenhut-corrections-corp-v-de-la-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">594</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 616 (Tex.\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2009, no pet.). Here, Katy Springs’ arguments do not match.\nTherefore, Katy Springs preserved nothing for review, and we overrule this sub-\nissue. See id. at 618.\n\n      Having overruled each of its six sub-issues challenging the jury charge, we\noverrule Katy Springs’ seventh issue in its entirety.\n\nIX.   CONCLUSION\n      Because the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s award for future\nmental anguish, we modify the judgment to delete the $100,000 award for future\nmental anguish and affirm the trial court’s judgment as modified.\n\n\n\n\n                                       /s/     Marc W.
