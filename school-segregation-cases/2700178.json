“PCA lawsuit” <p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>Crimson, an oil and gas production\r\ncompany, had an investment banking services agreement with PetroCapital\r\nAdvisors (“PCA”).<span>  </span>Under the agreement, PCA\r\nhad the right of first refusal to provide investment banking services to\r\nCrimson from April 21, 2004 through April 21, 2006.<span>  </span>A May 2004 agreement between Crimson and PCA\r\nsettling a fee dispute also specifically referenced this right.<span>  </span>Manolis, a director of Crimson, was involved\r\nin the settlement negotiations.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>After the settlement, PCA continued\r\nto provide services to Crimson, including searching for a company to acquire\r\nCrimson.<span>  </span>Crimson subsequently hired\r\nanother company, Intermarket, to also help identify potential buyers of\r\nCrimson.<span>  </span>Intermarket had ties to two\r\nCrimson executives</span><span>—Crimson director </span><span>Manolis, who owned Intermarket and\r\nwas its director and chief executive officer, and Crimson director and chief\r\nexecutive officer John Loehr, who leased office space to Intermarket.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>On December 31, 2004, Crimson and\r\nIntermarket signed an advisory agreement, effective July 1, 2004, setting out\r\ntheir business relationship.<span>  </span>The\r\nagreement included an indemnity clause, which provides, in relevant part <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Since [Intermarket] will be acting on behalf of\r\n[Crimson] in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement,\r\nand as part of the consideration for the agreement of [Intermarket] to furnish\r\nits services pursuant to such Agreement, [Crimson] agrees to indemnify and hold\r\nharmless [Intermarket] and its affiliates and their respective officers,\r\ndirectors, partners, counsel, employees and agents and any other person\r\ncontrolling [Intermarket] or any of its affiliates and the respective agents,\r\nemployees, officers, directors, partners, counsel and shareholders of such\r\npersons ([Intermarket] and each other person being referred to as “Indemnified\r\nPerson”), to the fullest extent lawful, from and against all claims,\r\nliabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as\r\nincurred, related to or arising out of or in connection with (i) actions taken\r\nor omitted to be taken by [Crimson], their affiliates, employees or agents,\r\nprovided, however, that [Crimson] shall not be responsible for any losses,\r\nclaims, judgments, damages, liabilities or expenses of any Indemnified Person\r\nto the extent, and only to the extent, that it is finally judicially determined\r\nthat they resulted from actions taken or omitted to be taken by such\r\nIndemnified Person in bad faith, fraud, deceit, breach of contract or to be due\r\nto such Indemnified Person’s wantonness, neglect, negligence or gross\r\nnegligence . . . <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>Intermarket subsequently identified\r\nOak Tree Capital Management LLC (“Oak Tree”) as a potential buyer for\r\nCrimson.<span>  </span>Crimson chose the Oak Tree\r\nproposal over one offered by a company which had been identified and brought to\r\nCrimson by PCA.<span>  </span>When Oak Tree subsequently\r\nacquired majority control of Crimson, Intermarket helped Crimson obtain\r\nfinancing for the transaction and was paid fees for this service.<span>   </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>In August 2005, PCA brought suit\r\nagainst Intermarket, Manolis, Loehr, and McMillan<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span></span>\r\nasserting common law and statutory fraud, negligent misrepresentation, tortious\r\ninterference with contract, conspiracy, and joint enterprise.<span>  </span>PCA alleged that Crimson, “rather than\r\nhonor[ing PCA’s] right of first refusal and giv[ing] PCA the right to perform\r\nthe needed investment banking services” for the Oak Tree transaction, “turn[ed]\r\nits back on its contractual obligation to PCA” and did not invite or allow PCA\r\nto perform any investment banking services for the transaction.<span>  </span>Instead, according to PCA, Intermarket\r\nprovided the investment banking services to Crimson and earned the related fees\r\nby virtue of a back-dated advisory agreement between Crimson and Intermarket.<span>  </span>PCA alleged that this caused PCA to suffer\r\nthe loss of the investment banking fees earned for the Oak Tree transaction.<span>  </span>PCA asserted that appellees interfered with\r\nCrimson’s contract with PCA regarding PCA’s right of first refusal, made\r\nmaterial false representations of fact or material omissions to PCA to induce\r\nPCA to enter into the May 2004 settlement agreement with Crimson, made\r\nnegligent misrepresentations to PCA, and engaged in a joint enterprise and\r\ncivil conspiracy with each other resulting in damage to PCA.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>During the pendency of the PCA\r\nlawsuit, David Myers, counsel for Intermarket and McMillan, sent a letter to\r\nCrimson requesting written confirmation that Crimson would indemnify\r\nIntermarket and Kevin McMillan pursuant to the indemnity clause of the advisory\r\nagreement. Crimson did not provide any confirmation and did not agree to indemnify\r\neither Intermarket or McMillan for any of the fees, costs, or expenses incurred\r\nin PCA’s lawsuit.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span></span><span>  </span>After a final take-nothing judgment was\r\nentered against PCA on all its claims,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span></span>\r\nMyers sent another letter demanding that Crimson pay the outstanding fees and\r\nexpenses incurred by all three appellees in defense of the PCA lawsuit.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span>B.<span>      </span>The\r\nBreach of Indemnity Contract Lawsuit</span></b><span> <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>          </span><b>1.<span>       </span>Appellees’\r\npetition and Crimson’s counterclaim<p></p></b></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>On October 11, 2007, appellees filed\r\nsuit against Crimson for breach of contract for failing to satisfy the\r\nindemnity obligations of the advisory agreement. Crimson filed a verified\r\ndenial, asserted numerous defenses, and raised a counterclaim for a declaratory\r\njudgment in which it requested the trial court to declare the parties’\r\nrespective rights under the agreement, including Crimson’s obligation to\r\nindemnify appellees. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><b><span>2.<span>  </span><span>     </span>The\r\nFirst Summary

motion for traditional summary judgment on their breach of indemnity\r\ncontract claim asserting that the attorney’s fees and expenses incurred in\r\ndefense of the PCA suit fell within the scope of the indemnity agreement.<span>  </span>Crimson responded that the indemnity\r\nprovision had not been triggered because PCA sued appellees for their own\r\nindividual conduct, not as the result of any conduct on the part of Crimson,\r\nand argued that there were genuine issues of material fact as to whether the\r\nPCA lawsuit was “related to, arising out of, or [connected] with” Crimson’s\r\nfailure to honor PCA’s right of first refusal, including whether Crimson\r\nactually failed to honor PCA’s right of first refusal.<span>  </span>After a hearing on appellees’ motion for\r\nsummary judgment on February 4, 2008, the trial court granted the motion,\r\nsigning an interlocutory order rendering judgment in favor of appellees on February\r\n19, 2008.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>Crimson filed a motion for\r\nreconsideration on March 20, 2008, arguing that summary judgment should not\r\nhave been granted because there was evidence creating genuine issues of\r\nmaterial fact as to whether indemnity arose under the agreement and because\r\nappellees relied on inadmissible evidence.<span> \r\n</span>After a hearing on April 4, 2008, the trial court stated that the ruling\r\nremained the same, overruled Crimson’s objections to appellees’ summary\r\njudgment evidence, ruled that the summary judgment evidence established the\r\namount of attorney’s fees incurred in the PCA lawsuit, and noted that the only\r\nremaining issues were the amount of attorney’s fees in this suit and Crimson’s\r\ncounterclaim.<span>  </span>The trial court signed an\r\norder on May 5, 2008 confirming the original grant of appellees’ motion for summary\r\njudgment, overruling Crimson’s objections to appellees’ summary judgment\r\nevidence, and denying Crimson’s motions for continuance.<b><p></p></b></span></p>\r\n\r\n<b><span><br clear=\"all\">\r\n</span></b>\r\n\r\n<p

class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><b><span><span>          </span></span></b><span>After\r\nthe trial court’s ruling in February 2008 granting summary judgment against\r\nCrimson on the breach of indemnity contract claim, Crimson amended its\r\ncounterclaim for declaratory judgment.<span> \r\n</span>Crimson’s March 5, 2008 amended counterclaim asked for specific\r\ndeclarations interpreting the contract as it pertained to the right to indemnity\r\nin the PCA lawsuit, appellees’ standing to sue Crimson, Crimson’s duty to\r\ndefend or reimburse appellees for attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the PCA\r\nlawsuit, and Crimson’s entitlement to attorney’s fees and costs for bringing the\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit.<span>  </span>Appellees’\r\nanswer to the amended counterclaim asserted that the claims were moot and that the\r\ncounterclaim was improper under the Declaratory Judgment Act because it did not\r\nassert a cause of action separate from appellees’ claims and involved a\r\none-time occurrence between the parties that was covered by appellees’\r\nclaims.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>          </span>After\r\nthe trial court reaffirmed its intent to grant summary judgment against Crimson\r\non appellees’ breach of indemnity contract claim on April 4 2008, Crimson filed\r\na motion seeking a traditional summary judgment on its amended declaratory\r\njudgment counterclaim.<span>  </span>Crimson argued\r\nthat it was entitled to a declaratory judgment that it was not required to\r\nreimburse appellees for the legal expenses incurred in defense of the PCA\r\nlawsuit and requested the trial court to “absolve [Crimson] of any obligation\r\nto reimburse [appellees] for the legal fees that [appellees] incurred in\r\ndefending the PCA lawsuit.”<span>  </span>Appellees\r\nresponded that the trial court had already twice addressed these issues in the\r\nprior summary judgment hearings on the breach of indemnity contract claim, held\r\non February 4 and April 4, and that Crimson’s declaratory judgment claim merely\r\ndenied appellees’ claim and was an improper use of the Texas Declaratory\r\nJudgment Act.<span>  </span>Crimson replied that its\r\ncounterclaim raised an issue beyond that raised by the appellees, namely,\r\nCrimson’s duty to defend appellees, and that appellees failed to raise a fact\r\nissue regarding Crimson’s duty to defend or rebut Crimson’s evidence that it\r\ndid not owe appellees a duty to defend.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span><span>          </span>At the\r\nMay 5, 2008 hearing on Crimson’s motion for summary judgment, Crimson stated\r\nthat it was “drop[ping]” its counterclaims regarding indemnity and was moving only\r\nfor a declaratory judgment on their duty to defend.<span>  </span>The trial court denied Crimson’s motion for\r\nsummary judgment, signing an order to that effect that same day.<span>   </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><b><span>4. <span>      </span>The\r\nThird Summary Judgment Ruling:<p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p

May\r\n12, 2008, appellees filed a motion for traditional summary judgment on\r\nCrimson’s declaratory judgment counterclaim, asserting that Crimson’s claims\r\nunder the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act failed as a matter of law.<span>  </span>Among appellees’ assertions was that appellants\r\nhad not sought a defense from Crimson and that there was no justiciable\r\ncontroversy related to a duty to defend.<span> \r\n</span>Crimson reasserted that its declaratory judgment counterclaim raised\r\nissues beyond those raised by appellees’ claims, namely whether Crimson had a\r\nduty under the agreement to defend appellees, alleged that appellees could not\r\nseek reimbursement of their attorney’s fees in defending the PCA lawsuit\r\nwithout also arguing that Crimson owed them a duty to defend, and argued that\r\nthere was a fact issue as to whether appellees requested a defense of the PCA\r\nlawsuit.<span>   </span></span><span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

“PCA lawsuit” <p></p></span></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>Crimson, an oil and gas production\r\ncompany, had an investment banking services agreement with PetroCapital\r\nAdvisors (“PCA”).<span>  </span>Under the agreement, PCA\r\nhad the right of first refusal to provide investment banking services to\r\nCrimson from April 21, 2004 through April 21, 2006.<span>  </span>A May 2004 agreement between Crimson and PCA\r\nsettling a fee dispute also specifically referenced this right.<span>  </span>Manolis, a director of Crimson, was involved\r\nin the settlement negotiations.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>After the settlement, PCA continued\r\nto provide services to Crimson, including searching for a company to acquire\r\nCrimson.<span>  </span>Crimson subsequently hired\r\nanother company, Intermarket, to also help identify potential buyers of\r\nCrimson.<span>  </span>Intermarket had ties to two\r\nCrimson executives</span><span>—Crimson director </span><span>Manolis, who owned Intermarket and\r\nwas its director and chief executive officer, and Crimson director and chief\r\nexecutive officer John Loehr, who leased office space to Intermarket.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>On December 31, 2004, Crimson and\r\nIntermarket signed an advisory agreement, effective July 1, 2004, setting out\r\ntheir business relationship.<span>  </span>The\r\nagreement included an indemnity clause, which provides, in relevant part <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Since [Intermarket] will be acting on behalf of\r\n[Crimson] in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement,\r\nand as part of the consideration for the agreement of [Intermarket] to furnish\r\nits services pursuant to such Agreement, [Crimson] agrees to indemnify and hold\r\nharmless [Intermarket] and its affiliates and their respective officers,\r\ndirectors, partners, counsel, employees and agents and any other person\r\ncontrolling [Intermarket] or any of its affiliates and the respective agents,\r\nemployees, officers, directors, partners, counsel and shareholders of such\r\npersons ([Intermarket] and each other person being referred to as “Indemnified\r\nPerson”), to the fullest extent lawful, from and

Tree\r\nproposal over one offered by a company which had been identified and brought to\r\nCrimson by PCA.<span>  </span>When Oak Tree subsequently\r\nacquired majority control of Crimson, Intermarket helped Crimson obtain\r\nfinancing for the transaction and was paid fees for this service.<span>   </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>In August 2005, PCA brought

and statutory fraud, negligent misrepresentation, tortious\r\ninterference with contract, conspiracy, and joint enterprise.<span>  </span>PCA alleged that Crimson, “rather than\r\nhonor[ing PCA’s] right of first refusal and giv[ing] PCA the right to perform\r\nthe needed investment banking services” for the Oak Tree transaction, “turn[ed]\r\nits back on its contractual obligation to PCA” and did not invite or allow PCA\r\nto perform any investment banking services for the transaction.<span>  </span>Instead, according to PCA, Intermarket\r\nprovided the investment banking services to Crimson and earned the related fees\r\nby virtue of a back-dated advisory agreement between Crimson and Intermarket.<span>  </span>PCA alleged that this caused PCA to suffer\r\nthe loss of the investment banking fees earned for the Oak Tree transaction.<span>  </span>PCA asserted that appellees interfered with\r\nCrimson’s contract with PCA regarding PCA’s right of first refusal, made\r\nmaterial false representations of fact or material omissions to PCA to induce\r\nPCA to enter into the May 2004 settlement agreement with Crimson, made\r\nnegligent misrepresentations to PCA, and engaged in a joint enterprise and\r\ncivil conspiracy with each other resulting in damage to PCA.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span>During the pendency

incurred in the PCA\r\nlawsuit, and Crimson’s entitlement to attorney’s fees and costs for bringing the\r\ndeclaratory judgment suit.<span>  </span>Appellees’\r\nanswer to the amended counterclaim asserted that the claims were moot and that the\r\ncounterclaim was improper under the Declaratory Judgment Act because it did not\r\nassert a cause of action separate from appellees’ claims and

to\r\nreimburse appellees for the legal expenses incurred in defense of the PCA\r\nlawsuit and requested the trial court to “absolve [Crimson] of any obligation\r\nto reimburse [appellees] for the

judgment hearings on the breach of indemnity contract claim, held\r\non February 4 and April 4, and that Crimson’s declaratory judgment claim merely\r\ndenied appellees’ claim and was an improper use of the Texas Declaratory\r\nJudgment Act.<span>  </span>Crimson replied that its\r\ncounterclaim raised an issue beyond that raised by the appellees, namely,\r\nCrimson’s duty to defend appellees, and that appellees failed to raise a fact\r\nissue regarding Crimson’s duty to defend or rebut Crimson’s evidence that it\r\ndid not owe appellees a duty to defend.<p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p

(2) PCA’s pleadings; and (3) and “portions” of the\r\naffidavits of appellees’ witnesses, “subject to [Crimson’s] objections.”<span>  </span>Crimson does not identify in its brief what\r\n“portions” of the affidavits are inadmissible, but the only objections\r\ndiscussed are that affidavits are not competent evidence of the “nature of\r\nPCA’s claims” and these witnesses did not have “adequate personal knowledge to\r\ntestify on the issue of PCA’s state of mind when it filed its pleadings in the\r\nPCA lawsuit.”<span>  </span>We note that, before the\r\ntrial court, Crimson only raised the first of these objections and made no\r\nobjection to a lack of knowledge by the witnesses as to “PCA’s state of mind.”\r\nIn fact, in its motion for reconsideration, Crimson specifically asserted that\r\nthe affidavits of Manolis, Loerhr, Myers and McMillan were “admissible summary\r\njudgment evidence.”<span>  </span>In any case, review\r\nof the affidavits in question does not reveal any testimony by McMillan, Loher,\r\nor Myers as to the nature of PCA’s claims or “PCA’s state of mind” when PCA\r\nfiled its lawsuit.<span>  </span>Manolis’s affidavit,\r\nhowever, includes the following sentence, which states a legal conclusion\r\nrelating to PCA’s claims: “In the PCA Suit, PCA alleged claims against IML\r\nrelated to, arising out of and in connection with statements allegedly made by\r\nme in the April/May 2004 timeframe during settlement negotiations of a fee\r\ndispute between PCA and [Crimson].”<span>  </span>Crimson\r\nalso complains of the inadmissibility of attached pleadings by Intermarket in\r\nthe PCA lawsuit and certain deposition testimony.<span>  </span><p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\"><span><p> </p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpLast\"><span>We need not\r\ndetermine whether the above portion of Manolis’s affidavit, the attached\r\nIntermarket pleadings, or the deposition testimony were proper summary judgment\r\nevidence because the unobjected-to portions of the affidavits, </span><span>Advisory\r\nAgreement, and PCA’s Fifth Amended Petition are </span><span>sufficient to support appellees’ motion for summary judgment on the\r\nbreach of indemnity contract claim. <p></p></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><p> </p></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn6\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[6]</span></span></span></span>\r\n<span>          </span><span>Crimson has also directed us to deposition testimony by Manolis in\r\nwhich Manolis testified that Crimson honored PCA’s right of first refusal.<span>  </span>(Manolis went on to explain that Crimson’s\r\ninterpretation of PCA’s right of first refusal was that PCA had a <i>non-exclusive</i> right to bring in\r\ninvestors, and, it was therefore Crimson’s position that, because PCA did bring\r\nin investors, PCA’s right of first refusal was honored.)<span>  </span>However, even if we assumed that Crimson\r\nactually honored PCA’s right of first refusal, there was still evidence of a\r\ncausal connection between other acts of Crimson (the entering into the advisory\r\nagreement with Intermarket and the payment of fees to Intermarket for the Oak\r\nTree transaction) and the PCA lawsuit.<span>  </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"ftn7\">\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[7]</span></span></span></span>\r\n<span>          </span>Appellees assert that Crimson\r\nhas failed to preserve this issue because Crimson did not make a specific\r\nchallenge in either its response to the motion for summary judgment or its\r\nmotion for reconsideration to the lack of evidence of the reasonableness of the\r\nattorney’s fees sought as damages.<span> \r\n</span>However, Crimson was not required to object in the trial court to the\r\ninsufficiency of appellees’ summary judgment proof supporting the award of\r\nattorney’s fees as damages in order to preserve this challenge for appellate\r\nreview;
