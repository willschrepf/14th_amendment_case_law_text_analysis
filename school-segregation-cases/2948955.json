The Goldmans filed a third-party petition against Sandra\n\nHewett, the real estate agent who represented them in the transaction, asserting claims for\n\nnegligence, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA),\n\nfraud in a real estate transaction, common law fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, and\n\nagainst NRT Texas, L.L.C. (NRT), the broker with whom Hewett was associated, asserting it\n\nwas liable for Hewett’s actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior.     Hewett filed a\n\ncounterclaim against the Goldmans based on fraud.\n\n       The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the Olmsteads for damages in the amount of\n\n$56,929.85, plus attorney’s fees and costs of $151,110.17 and contingent attorney’s fees for\n\fappeal. The trial court also rendered judgment that the Goldmans take nothing on their claims\n\nagainst Hewett and NRT and that Hewett take nothing on her fraud claim against the Goldmans.\n\nThe trial court found that Hewett and NRT were prevailing parties under the terms of the\n\ncontract and rendered judgment that they recover $150,000 in attorney’s fees plus contingent\n\nfees for appeal.\n\n       In eight issues, the Goldmans assert the trial court erred by: (1) granting the Olmsteads’\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the Goldmans were liable for\n\nbreach of the contract; (2) denying the Goldmans’ competing motion for summary judgment; (3)\n\nrefusing to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law; (4) granting the Olmsteads’ motion for\n\nleave to amend their petition in contravention of a rule 11 agreement; (5) awarding carrying costs\n\non the property as damages; (6) allowing expert witnesses to testify when their opinions had not\n\nbeen fully disclosed; (7) awarding the Olmsteads attorney’s fees without requiring segregation\n\nbetween recoverable and non-recoverable fees; and (8) awarding Hewett and NRT attorney’s\n\nfees because they were not prevailing parties under the contract and failed to segregate\n\nrecoverable and non-recoverable fees. We reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of the\n\nOlmsteads, render judgment that the Olmsteads take nothing on their claims against the\n\nGoldmans, and remand the issue of the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Olmsteads.\n\nWe reverse and remand the issue of the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to Hewett and NRT.\n\nIn all other respects, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                            Background\n\n       In August 2009, the Goldmans requested that Hewett assist them with the purchase of a\n\nnew home. The Goldmans decided to make an offer to purchase a house at 3813 Stanford that\n\nwas owned by the Olmsteads (the Stanford house). The Goldmans obtained a prequalification\n\n\n\n\n                                                 –2–\n\fletter through Bank of America’s online process on September 21, 2009 to submit with the offer.\n\nThe Olmsteads agreed to sell the house to the Goldmans for $810,000.\n\n        On September 26, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads executed a One to Four Family\n\nResidential Contract, a form contract prepared by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC),\n\nfor the Goldmans to purchase the Stanford house. The contract provided for a ten-day option\n\nperiod during which the Goldmans could terminate the contract for any reason. It also provided\n\nfor a thirty-day option period during which the Goldmans could terminate the contract if, after\n\napplying for and making every reasonable effort to obtain financing on certain specified terms,\n\nthe Goldmans were unable to obtain financing for the purchase of the Stanford house. Mark\n\nGoldman “immediately” applied for a loan with Randolf Brooks Credit Union. On September\n\n27, 2009, the Olmsteads gave written notice to their tenants to vacate the Stanford house within\n\nthirty days.\n\n        On October 3, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads executed an amendment to the\n\ncontract that required the Olmsteads to pay $1,000 of the Goldmans’ closing costs in lieu of\n\nmaking certain repairs to the house. On October 5, 2009, the credit union declined to fund the\n\nGoldmans’ loan because their income was insufficient for the amount of credit requested and the\n\nloan could “over obligate” them. A credit union employee informed Mark Goldman that the loan\n\nwas declined because the Goldmans planned to continue to own their existing home following\n\nthe purchase of the Stanford house.\n\n        Mark Goldman then applied for a loan from Bank of America. In connection with the\n\napplication, Mark Goldman provided Bank of America with false information about his\n\nemployer and his monthly income. On October 13, 2009, the Goldmans’ loan officer at Bank of\n\nAmerica sent an email to Mark Goldman, with a copy to Hewett and to Sandy Smith, the\n\nOlmsteads’ real estate agent, stating the underwriter was “requiring a legible, fully executed\n\n                                              –3–\n\fcopy of the sales contract” and that the copy of the contract that Bank of America had was “very\n\nblurry.” The loan officer attached a “clean copy of the sales contract” to the email. On or\n\naround October 14, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads signed a “clean copy” of the contract.\n\n            The contract set a closing date of November 4, 2009. On November 4, 2009, the\n\nGoldmans and the Olmsteads agreed to amend the contract to extend the closing date to\n\nNovember 18, 2009. On November 9, 2009, Bank of America informed the Goldmans that it\n\nwas declining to fund the loan because it could not verify Mark Goldman’s income. Although\n\nMark Goldman applied for a loan from two other lenders, the Goldmans were not able to obtain\n\nfinancing to purchase the Stanford house. On November 12, 2009, the Goldmans executed a\n\nwritten notice terminating the contract based on their inability to obtain financing.\n\n            The Olmsteads sued the Goldmans for breach of contract, requesting specific\n\nperformance or, alternatively, damages. 1                             The Goldmans answered, raising a number of\n\naffirmative defenses. The Goldmans also filed a third-party petition against Hewett and NRT,\n\nasserting claims against Hewett for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the DTPA,\n\nfraud in a real estate transaction, common law fraud, and negligent misrepresentation and\n\nseeking to hold NRT liable for Hewett’s actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\n\nHewett asserted a counterclaim against the Goldmans for fraud, alleging Mark Goldman\n\nprovided false information to Bank of America in order to obtain the prequalification letter. 2\n\n            The Olmsteads filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the\n\nGoldmans breached the contract. The Goldmans responded, and filed a competing motion for\n\nsummary judgment, on grounds they did not breach the contract because the contract was\n\n\n     1\n       In their first amended petition filed on June 14, 2010, the Olmsteads deleted their request for specific performance of the contract. In their\nsecond amended petition filed on April 8, 2011, the Olmsteads added claims based on fraud in a real estate transaction and common law fraud,\nbut abandoned these claims prior to trial. .\n     2\n         In November 2010, the Olmsteads sold the Stanford house to another buyer for $740,000.\n\n\n\n                                                                       –4–\n\funenforceable, void or voidable, or terminated on its own terms, and there had been a novation\n\nand the new contract was properly terminated based on the Goldmans’ inability to obtain\n\nfinancing. The trial court granted the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ndenied the Goldmans’ motion for summary judgment.\n\n       The amount of the Olmsteads’ damages for the Goldmans’ breach of the contract and the\n\nclaims between the Goldmans and Hewett and NRT were tried to the court. The trial court found\n\nthe Olmsteads’ damages for the breach were $56,929.85. It also determined the Olmsteads were\n\nprevailing parties under the contract and awarded the Olmsteads attorney’s fees and costs of\n\n$151,110.17 plus contingent attorney’s fees for appeal. The trial court rendered judgment that\n\nthe Goldmans take nothing on their claims against Hewett and NRT and that Hewett take nothing\n\non her claim against the Goldmans. The trial court also determined that Hewett and NRT were\n\nprevailing parties under the contract and awarded them attorney’s fees of $150,000 plus\n\ncontingent attorney’s fees for appeal.\n\n                                         Summary Judgment\n\n       In their first two issues, the Goldmans contend the trial court erred by granting the\n\nOlmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and denying the Goldmans’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. We review a trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.\n\nTravelers Ins. Co. v. Joachim, 315 S.W.3d 860, 862 (Tex. 2010). The movant requesting a\n\ntraditional summary judgment has the burden to demonstrate that no genuine issue of material\n\nfact exists and judgment should be rendered as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Nixon v.\n\nMr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548–49 (Tex. 1985). In reviewing a summary judgment,\n\nwe view all evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. Smith v. O’Donnell, 288\n\nS.W.3d 417, 424 (Tex. 2009); 20801, Inc. v. Parker, 249 S.W.3d 392, 399 (Tex. 2008). We\n\ncredit evidence favorable to the nonmovant if reasonable jurors could, and we disregard evidence\n\n                                               –5–\n\fcontrary to the nonmovant unless reasonable jurors could not. Mann Frankfort Stein & Lipp\n\nAdvisors, Inc. v. Fielding, 289 S.W.3d 844, 848 (Tex. 2009). When both parties move for\n\nsummary judgment and the trial court grants one motion and denies the other, we consider both\n\nmotions, their evidence, and their issues, and we may render the judgment that the trial court\n\nshould have rendered. Id.\n\n       The Goldsteins do not dispute on appeal that the summary judgment evidence established\n\nthey executed a contract to purchase the Stanford house and failed to close the sale. Rather, they\n\nassert the trial erred by granting the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ndenying their motion for summary judgment because (1) the contract fails to identify the sellers\n\nand material terms of the contract are otherwise illegible and, therefore, it is indefinite and\n\nunenforceable; (2) Smith failed to timely disclose that she is Summer Olmstead’s mother and,\n\ntherefore, the contract is against public policy and void; (3) the Olmsteads timely received notice\n\nfrom Bank of America that it would not approve the Goldmans’ loan application and, therefore,\n\nthe contract terminated on its own terms; and (4) there was a novation of the contract and the\n\nnew contract was properly terminated based on the Goldmans’ inability to obtain financing.\n\n                                      Indefinite and Illegible\n\n       The Goldmans first argue the contract was indefinite and, therefore, unenforceable\n\nbecause it is illegible and fails to identify the sellers. Whether a contract is too indefinite to be\n\nenforced is a question of law. Fiduciary Fin. Servs. of the Sw., Inc. v. Corilant Fin., L.P., 376\n\nS.W.3d 253, 256 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. denied).\n\n       The elements of a valid and enforceable contract are: (1) an offer; (2) an acceptance in\n\nstrict compliance with the terms of the offer; (3) a meeting of the minds; (4) each party’s consent\n\nto the terms; and (5) execution and delivery of the contract with the intent that it be mutual and\n\nbinding. Effel v. McGarry, 339 S.W.3d 789, 792 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2011, pet. denied). “In\n\n                                                –6–\n\fgeneral, a contract is legally binding only if its terms are sufficiently definite to enable a court to\n\nunderstand the parties’ obligations.” Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City of Fort Worth, 22\n\nS.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000); see also T.O. Stanley Boot Co., Inc. v. Bank of El Paso, 847\n\nS.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992). If the terms of an alleged contract are so indefinite that it is\n\nimpossible for the courts to determine the rights and obligations of the parties, it is not an\n\nenforceable agreement. Effel, 339 S.W.3d at 792; see also Corilant Fin., L.P., 376 S.W.3d at\n\n256. “The rules regarding indefiniteness of material terms of a contract are based on the concept\n\nthat a party cannot accept an offer so as to form a contract unless the terms of that contract are\n\nreasonably certain.” City of Fort Worth, 22 S.W.3d at 846.\n\n        The Goldmans first assert the contract is indefinite because it is illegible. The summary\n\njudgment evidence reflects that, on September 26, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads\n\nexecuted a standard form contract promulgated by the TREC for the sale of the Stanford house to\n\nthe Goldmans for $810,000. The copy of the September 26, 2009 contract in the record is\n\ndifficult to read. However, Bank of America provided for signature a “clean copy” of the\n\ncontract in order to process the Goldmans’ loan application for the purchase of the Stanford\n\nhouse. The summary judgment evidence includes a “clean copy” of the contract signed on or\n\naround October 14, 2009 by the Goldmans and the Olmsteads for the sale of the Stanford\n\nproperty to the Goldmans for $810,000. Accordingly, the trial court could determine from the\n\nsummary judgment evidence the essential terms of the contract between the parties, and the\n\ncontract is not indefinite because it is illegible.\n\n        The Goldmans next contend the contract is indefinite and fails for lack of mutuality\n\nbecause the names of the sellers were not included on the first page of the contract. The contract\n\ncontains a blank on the first page for the names of the sellers. This blank was not completed in\n\neither the September 26 or the October 14 copies of the contract. However, both copies of the\n\n                                                      –7–\n\fcontract name Jeff Olmstead as the person to receive notifications for the sellers. The sellers\n\nalso provided an email address of olmstead.summer@gmail.com. Both Summer Olmstead and\n\nJeffrey Olmstead initialed each page of the contract and signed the contract in the appropriate\n\nlocations. We conclude the contract identified the sellers sufficiently to bind the Olmsteads and\n\nwas not indefinite due to a failure to identify the sellers.\n\n         The Goldmans finally argue that, because the contract is illegible and fails to identify the\n\nsellers, it fails under the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds provides that a contract for the\n\nsale of real estate is not enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the person to be charged\n\nwith the agreement. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(a), (b)(4) (West 2009). To comply\n\nwith the statute, the writing must contain the essential terms of the contract, expressed with such\n\ncertainty that they may be understood without resorting to oral testimony. Cohen v. McCutchin,\n\n565 S.W.2d 230, 232 (Tex. 1978). The contract for the sale of the Stanford house was in writing,\n\ncontained the essential terms of the agreement, and was signed by both the Olmsteads and the\n\nGoldmans. It, therefore, complied with the statute of frauds.\n\n         We conclude the trial court did not err by concluding the contract was enforceable.\n\n                                     Void or Voidable Contract\n\n         Relying on title 22, section 535.144(a) of the Texas Administrative Code, the Goldmans\n\nnext contend that, because Smith failed to timely disclose that she is Summer Olmstead’s\n\nmother, the contract to purchase the Stanford house was either void or voidable as against public\n\npolicy. Whether a contract violates public policy is a question of law that we review de novo.\n\nJohnson v. Structured Asset Servs., LLC, 148 S.W.3d 711, 726 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no\n\npet.).\n\n         “A court can declare a contract void as against public policy and refuse to enforce it.” In\n\nre C.H.C., 396 S.W.3d 33, 51 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.). Texas expresses its public\n\n                                                  –8–\n\fpolicy through its statutes and regulations. Tex. Commerce Bank, N.A. v. Grizzle, 96 S.W.3d\n\n240, 250 (Tex. 2002); S. Cnty. Mut. Ins. v. Sur. Bank, N.A., 270 S.W.3d 684, 689 (Tex. App.—\n\nFort Worth 2008, no pet.) (recognizing Texas public policy as expressed through statutes and\n\nregulations); see also Dugger v. Arredondo, No. 11-0549, 2013 WL 4608741, at *9 (Tex Aug.\n\n30, 2013). “In examining an agreement to determine if it is contrary to public policy, a court\n\nlooks to whether the agreement has a tendency to injure the public good and considers the\n\ndevelopment and policies underlying any applicable statutes.” Interstate 35/Chisam Road, L.P.\n\nv. Moayedi, 377 S.W.3d 791, 797 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. filed); see also Fairfield Ins.\n\nCo. v. Stephens Martin Paving, L.P., 246 S.W.3d 653, 665–66 (Tex. 2008). The rule that public\n\npolicy precludes the enforcement of an otherwise valid contract should be applied cautiously and\n\nonly in cases involving dominant public interests. Johnson, 148 S.W.3d at 726.\n\n           Section 1101.652(a)(3) of the occupations code provides, in relevant part, that the TREC\n\nmay suspend or revoke a license issued under chapter 1101 of the code or take disciplinary\n\naction authorized by chapter 1101 of the code if a license holder 3 engages in misrepresentation,\n\ndishonesty, or fraud when selling real property in the name of a person related to the license\n\nholder within the first degree by consanguinity. TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. § 1101.002(4), (7);\n\n1101.652(a)(3)(C) (West 2012). For purposes of section 1101.652(a)(3) “a person related to the\n\nlicense holder within the first degree by consanguinity” is the license holder’s parent or child. 22\n\nT.A.C. § 535.144(a)(1). The regulations in effect in September 2009 required a license holder\n\nengaged in a real estate transaction for a child of the license holder to inform any person with\n\nwhom the license holder dealt, either by disclosure in any contract of sale or in any other writing\n\n\n     3\n        A license issued under chapter 1101 includes a license issued to a “salesperson.” TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. § 1101.002(4). A “salesperson”\nis “a person who is associated with a licensed broker for the purpose of performing” certain specified activities. Id. §1101.002(7). These\nactivities include selling, offering to sell, negotiating or attempting to negotiate the sale, or listing for sale real estate in exchange for a\ncommission or other valuable consideration or with the expectation of receiving a commission or other valuable consideration. Id.\n§ 1101.002(1)(i)–(iii). It is undisputed that Smith is a license holder under chapter 1101.\n\n\n\n                                                                     –9–\n\fgiven prior to entering into any contract of sale, that she was a licensed real estate salesperson\n\nacting on behalf of her child. 31 Tex. Reg. 1406 (2006), adopted 31 Tex. Reg. 4198 (2006)\n\n(amended by 35 Tex. Reg. 8268 (2010), adopted 35 Tex. Reg. 11691 (2010) and by 38 Tex. Reg.\n\n1332 (2013), adopted 38 Tex. Reg. 3347 (2013) (codified at 22 Tex. Admin. Code § 535.144(b)).\n\n       Smith failed to disclose to the Goldmans, prior to the execution of the contract of sale for\n\nthe Stanford house on September 26, 2009, that she is Summer Olmstead’s mother. Rather, she\n\nfirst made the disclosure in the October 3, 2009 amendment to the contract. The Goldmans\n\nargue section 535.144 of the administrative code sets out the public policy of Texas that a real\n\nestate agent selling residential real property for her child is required to disclose the relationship\n\nto the buyer and that, when a disclosure is required under section 535.144 but is not made, any\n\nrelated contract for the sale of real estate is void or voidable as against public policy.\n\n       Section 1101.652 of the occupations code relates solely to the suspension or revocation of\n\na license issued under chapter 1101. Northborough Corporate Ltd. P’ship, L.L.P. v. Cushman &\n\nWakefield of Tex., Inc., 162 S.W.3d 816, 821 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.).\n\nA license holder is subject to administrative penalties for a violation of either section\n\n1101.652(a)(3) of the occupations code or of section 533.144 of the administrative code. See 32\n\nTex. Reg. 7655 (2007), adopted 32 Tex. Reg. 9995 (2007) (current version at 22 T.A.C.\n\n§ 535.191(d)(11), (e)(10)). Neither section 1101.652 of the occupations code nor any applicable\n\nversion of section 535.144 of the administrative code provides that the non-compliance of the\n\nlicense holder causes any related contract for the sale of real estate to be void. Further, the\n\noccupations code sets out a procedure by which a person injured by a license holder’s violation\n\nof section 1101.652(a)(3) can be made whole through the payment of a claim from the TREC\n\nrecovery trust account. See TEX. OCC. CODE ANN. §§ 1101.601–.602, .605–.612 (West 2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 –10–\n\f       We conclude the public policy of Texas, as expressed in its statutes and regulations, is (1)\n\nto allow the TREC to discipline a real estate agent who fails to comply with section\n\n1101.652(a)(3) of the occupations code or section 535.144 of the administrative code, and (2) to\n\ncompensate a party aggrieved by a license holder’s failure to comply with section 1101.652(a)(3)\n\nthrough the payment of damages. Accordingly, we cannot conclude the related real estate\n\ncontract is void. Davis v. Hendrick Autoguard, Inc., 294 S.W.3d 835, 840 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2009, no pet.) (“[W]here the legislature creates a statutory framework to secure performance of\n\nand compliance with a statute, it is ‘the reasonable implication that the legislature meant for only\n\nthe statutory remedies to be applied, and did not mean for courts to refuse to enforce contracts,\n\nwhich were not declared void or unenforceable, though in contravention of the statute.’”)\n\n(quoting Borger v. Brand, 131 Tex. 614, 619, 118 S.W.2d 303, 306 (1938)); New Boston Gen.\n\nHosp., Inc. v. Tex. Workforce Comm’n, 47 S.W.3d 34, 40 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 2001, no pet.)\n\n(op. on reh’g).\n\n                           Termination of Contract on Its Own Terms\n\n       The Goldmans next argue the contract terminated on its own terms when the Olmsteads\n\nreceived the email on October 13, 2009 from Bank of America stating its underwriter required a\n\nlegible copy of the contract.      The Goldmans contend this communication informed the\n\nOlmsteads that the Goldmans could not obtain financing and was received by the Olmsteads\n\nwithin the thirty-day period during which the contract could be terminated under the financing\n\ncontingency.\n\n       The financing contingency in the contract allowed the Goldmans to terminate the contract\n\nby written notice to the Olmsteads if, within thirty days after the effective date of the contract,\n\nthe Goldmans could not obtain financing approval on certain listed terms. It is undisputed the\n\nGoldmans did not provide written notice that they were terminating the contract within thirty\n\n                                               –11–\n\fdays of the effective date of the contract. Further, even if an email from Bank of America could\n\nconstitute notice from the Goldmans that they were exercising their right to terminate the\n\ncontract due to an inability to obtain financing, the email relied upon by the Goldmans neither\n\nterminated the contract nor indicated the Goldmans could not obtain financing from Bank of\n\nAmerica. Rather, the Bank of America email stated merely that the underwriter required a\n\nlegible copy of the contract.    Further, the parties did not treat the contract as terminated\n\nfollowing the email. See Mattlage v. Mattlage, 243 S.W.3d 763, 770–71 (Tex. App.—Waco\n\n2007, pet. denied). We conclude the trial court did not err by determining, as a matter of law,\n\nthat the October 13, 2009 email from Bank of America did not terminate the contract under the\n\nfinancing contingency.\n\n                                            Novation\n\n       The Goldmans finally argue the copy of the contract signed on or around October 14,\n\n2009 was a novation of the September 26, 2009 contract and they timely terminated the new\n\ncontract pursuant to the financing contingency provision. A novation is the substitution of a new\n\nagreement in place of an existing agreement between the parties. In re B.N.L.-B., 375 S.W.3d\n\n557, 562 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.). “A novation occurs if a contract evidences an\n\nintention to relinquish and extinguish pre-existing claims and rights of action; in lieu of the old\n\nobligation, a party accepts the promise of performance of the new obligation instead of the\n\nperformance itself.” Fulcrum Cent. v. AutoTester, Inc., 102 S.W.3d 274, 277 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2003, no pet.).\n\n       To establish a novation, the party must prove: (1) a previous valid obligation; (2) an\n\nagreement of the parties to a new contract; (3) the extinguishment of the old contract; and (4) the\n\nvalidity of the new contract. In re B.N.L.-B, 375 S.W.3d at 562 (citing Fulcrum Cent., 102\n\nS.W.3d at 277). The substitution of a new agreement occurs when a later agreement is so\n\n                                              –12–\n\finconsistent with a former agreement that the two cannot subsist together. Id. at 562–63. “In the\n\nabsence of inconsistent provisions, ‘a second contract will operate as a novation of a first\n\ncontract only when the parties to both contracts intend and agree that the obligations of the\n\nsecond shall be substituted for and operate as a discharge of the obligations of the first.’”\n\nFulcrum Cent., 102 S.W.3d at 277 (quoting Chastain v. Cooper & Reed, 152 Tex. 322, 325, 257\n\nS.W.2d 422, 424 (1953)). Whether a subsequent agreement works a novation of an earlier\n\nagreement is a question of intent. Id. The parties must have clearly intended a novation and a\n\nnovation is never presumed. White v. Harrison, 390 S.W.3d 666, 675 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012,\n\nno pet.); Fulcrum Cent., 102 S.W.3d at 278. “In the absence of express agreement, whether a\n\nnew contract operates as a novation of an earlier contract is ‘usually a question of fact, and can\n\nonly become a question of law when the state of the evidence is such that reasonable minds\n\ncannot differ as to its effect.’” Fulcrum Cent., 102 S.W.3d at 278 (quoting Chastain, 152 Tex. at\n\n325, 257 S.W.2d at 424).\n\n       In response to the Olmsteads’ breach of contract claims, the Goldmans asserted the\n\naffirmative defense of novation. The Olmsteads moved for partial summary judgment on the\n\nGoldmans’ liability for breach of contract and specifically asserted that, as a matter of law, there\n\nhad not been a novation of the contract. The Olmsteads argued the October 14, 2009 contract\n\nwas a reiteration or retyping of the September 26, 2009 contract and “[b]y signing retyped pages\n\nof the Contract, the parties did not intend to restart the Financing Addendum deadline, extinguish\n\nthe Original Contract Document or Repair Amendment, or create a new contract.”                 The\n\nGoldmans responded to the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment, and also moved\n\nfor summary judgment, asserting the payment terms in the September 26, 2009 and the October\n\n14, 2009 contracts were inconsistent because the October 4, 2009 contract did not include the\n\n$1,000 repair credit. The Goldmans raise the same argument on appeal.\n\n                                               –13–\n\f       The trial court granted the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and denied\n\nthe Goldmans’ motion for summary judgment without stating the basis for the rulings. In order\n\nto obtain a reversal of a summary judgment, an appellant must attack every ground relied on for\n\nwhich summary judgment could have been granted. Malooly Bros., Inc. v. Napier, 461 S.W.2d\n\n119, 121 (Tex. 1970); Trevino & Assocs. Mech., L.P. v. Frost Nat’l Bank, 400 S.W.3d 139, 144\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, no pet.). If an appellant fails to challenge one of the grounds for\n\nsummary judgment, an appellate court may affirm the summary judgment on that ground alone.\n\nTrevino & Assocs. Mech., L.P., 400 S.W.3d at 144. The Goldmans have failed to challenge on\n\nappeal the Olmsteads’ ground for summary judgment that the parties did not intend for the\n\nOctober 14, 2009 contract to be a novation of the September 26, 2009 contract. Because the\n\nOlmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment contains grounds for summary judgment that\n\nthe Goldmans failed to adequately challenge in their appellate brief, we affirm the trial court’s\n\njudgment that there was not a novation of the contract. See Malooly, 461 S.W.2d at 121; Trevino\n\n& Assocs. Mech., L.P., 400 S.W.3d at 144.\n\n                                            Conclusion\n\n       We conclude the trial court did not err by granting the Olmsteads’ motion for partial\n\nsummary judgment on the issue of whether the Goldmans were liable for breach of contract and\n\nby denying the Goldmans’ motion for summary judgment on grounds the contract was not\n\nenforceable, terminated on its own terms, or was void or voidable, and that the October 14, 2009\n\ncontract was a novation of the September 26, 2009 contract. We resolve the Goldmans’ first and\n\nsecond issues against them.\n\n                 Failure to Make Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law\n\n       In their third issue, the Goldmans assert the trial court erred by failing to make findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law following the bench trial. After the parties’ briefs in this case\n\n                                              –14–\n\fwere filed, the trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law. We can consider\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law signed after a trial court has lost plenary power. HSBC\n\nBank USA, N.A. v. Watson, 377 S.W.3d 766, 772 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, pet. filed); Morrison\n\nv. Morrison, 713 S.W.2d 377, 381 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1986, writ dism’d) (concluding there is\n\nno jurisdictional impediment to a trial court’s making belated findings of fact).\n\n       After the trial court made its findings of fact and conclusions of law, no party to this\n\nappeal requested permission to file supplemental briefing to challenge any of the findings of fact.\n\nSee In re K.L.W., 301 S.W.3d 423, 428 n.5 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.). Further, at oral\n\nargument, the Goldmans represented the only finding they would have challenged if the findings\n\nhad been made timely was that their DTPA claims against Hewett and NRT were “based on\n\nprofessional advice, judgment, opinion or similar skill for which they cannot be liable.”\n\nHowever, the trial court also made findings that the Goldmans’ DTPA claims failed because they\n\n“did not rely on any act or practice of Hewett to their detriment” and because “[n]o act or\n\nomission of Hewett was a producing cause of the Goldmans’ damages.” These findings form an\n\nindependent basis for the denial of the Goldmans’ DTPA claims.\n\n       We conclude the Goldmans have failed to demonstrate any harm from the trial court’s\n\nfailure to make timely findings of fact and conclusions of law. See Oliphant Fin. LLC v.\n\nAngiano, 295 S.W.3d 422, 424 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, no pet.) (when appellant fails to\n\nchallenge all independent grounds supporting judgment, “we must accept the validity of that\n\nunchallenged independent ground,” and any error identified by appellant is harmless); In re\n\nA.E.A., No. 02-12-00510-CV, 2013 WL 3761309, at *9 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth July 18, 2013,\n\nno pet.) (any error in trial court’s finding of fact was harmless due to appellant’s failure to\n\nchallenge all bases of finding on appeal). We resolve the Goldmans’ third issue against them.\n\n\n\n\n                                               –15–\n\f                                             Damages\n\n       In their fifth issue, the Goldmans contend the trial court erred by awarding the Olmsteads\n\ndamages based on the carrying costs of the Stanford house after the Goldmans breached the\n\ncontract until the house was sold because this is not the correct measure of damages for the\n\nbreach of a residential real estate contract. Whether the trial court erred by applying an improper\n\nmeasure of damages is a question of law that we review de novo. City of Carrollton v. RIHR\n\nInc., 308 S.W.3d 444, 452 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, pet. denied).\n\n       The contract provided that, if the Goldmans failed to comply with the contract, the\n\nOlmsteads could “(a) enforce specific performance, seek such other relief as may be provided by\n\nlaw, or both, or (b) terminate this contract and receive the earnest money as liquidated damages,\n\nthereby releasing both parties from this contract.” The Olmsteads chose to proceed under option\n\n(a) in the contract, seeking specific performance or, alternatively, damages for the breach. The\n\nOlmsteads subsequently amended their petition and requested only damages for the breach.\n\n       At various points in the litigation, the Olmsteads sought damages based on the difference\n\nbetween the $810,000 the Goldmans agreed to pay for the Stanford house and the amount for\n\nwhich the house was ultimately sold, the loss of rental income resulting from the Olmsteads’\n\ntenants vacating the house, and the costs of carrying the house after the Goldmans breached the\n\ncontract. However, prior to trial, the Olmsteads dropped their claims for damages based on the\n\ndifference in the contract prices and for lost rents and, at trial, sought only to recover as actual\n\ndamages “their mortgage interest, utilities, taxes, insurance, and lawn care.” The Olmsteads\n\noffered evidence that between the time of the Goldmans’ breach and the sale of the Stanford\n\nhouse in November 2010, they paid $56,929.85 for mortgage interest, utilities, property taxes,\n\ninsurance, and yard maintenance for the Stanford house.\n\n\n\n\n                                               –16–\n\f          The Goldmans assert the proper measure of damages for breach of a residential real estate\n\ncontract is the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property on the\n\ndate of the breach and that the carrying costs recovered by the Olmsteads, while perhaps\n\nrecoverable as part of an equitable accounting in a suit for specific performance of the contract,\n\nare not recoverable in a suit for damages.\n\n          Generally, the measure of actual damages in a breach of contract case is the loss of the\n\nbenefit of the bargain, which would put the plaintiff in the same economic position he would\n\nhave been in had the contract actually been performed. Am. Nat’l Petroleum Co. v. Transcon.\n\nGas Pipe Line Corp., 798 S.W.2d 274, 278 (Tex. 1990); Barry v. Jackson, 309 S.W.3d 135, 140\n\n(Tex. App.—Austin 2010, no pet.) (op. on reh’g). When a real estate contract is breached by the\n\npurchaser, the measure of damages is the difference between the price the seller was to receive\n\nand the market value of the property at the date of the breach. Kempner v. Heidenheimer, 65\n\nTex. 587, 591 (1886); Long v. Brown, 593 S.W.2d 371, 372 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1979, writ\n\nref’d n.r.e.); Barry, 309 S.W.3d at 140. 4 In this case, the Goldmans agreed to purchase the\n\nStanford house for $810,000, and the Olmsteads admitted the market value of the house on the\n\ndate of the breach was $810,000. However, relying on Barry and Claflin v. Hillock Homes, Inc.,\n\n645 S.W.2d 629, 630 (Tex. App.—Austin 1983, writ ref’d n.r.e.), the Olmsteads contend they are\n\nnot limited to the general measure of damages and may recover, as consequential damages, their\n\ncarrying costs of the Stanford house from the date of the breach until they sold the house a year\n\nlater.\n\n          We first note that the Olmsteads’ reliance on Claflin is misplaced. In Claflin, Janis\n\nClaflin agreed to purchase a home from Hillock Homes, Inc. Claflin, 645 S.W.2d at 631. After\n\n\n     4\n       See also Kollmeyer v. Stewart, No. 05-00-01787-CV, 2001 WL 1570322, at *3 (Tex. App.—Dallas Dec. 11, 2001, no pet.) (not designated\nfor publication).\n\n\n\n                                                                 –17–\n\fClaflin failed to close on the contract, Hillock Homes sued her for breach of contract and\n\nrequested specific performance. Id. at 632. The trial court granted Hillock Homes’ request for\n\nspecific performance and awarded it attorney’s fees as well as additional expenses it incurred in\n\ncontinuing to finance the interim construction loan with which it originally built the house. Id. at\n\n630.\n\n       On appeal, the Austin Court of Appeals first determined the trial court did not err by\n\ngranting Hillock Homes’ request for specific performance. Id. at 633–34. It then turned to\n\nClaflin’s argument that Hillock Homes could not recover its carrying costs because it failed to\n\nmitigate its damages by renting the house or by requiring sufficient earnest money to cover the\n\ninterim financing charges. Id. at 635. The court of appeals, in concluding the trial court did not\n\nerr by awarding Hillock Homes its carrying costs, noted the carrying costs were not damages per\n\nse, but a form of equitable accounting in a suit involving specific performance. Id. at 635.\n\n       Specific performance is an equitable remedy that may be awarded for a breach of\n\ncontract, Stafford v. S. Vanity Magazine, Inc., 231 S.W.3d 530, 535 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2007,\n\npet. denied), and is an alternative remedy to damages. Levetz v. Sutton, 404 S.W.3d 798, 805\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, pet. filed) (citing Paciwest, Inc. v. Warner Alan Props., LLC, 266\n\nS.W.3d 559, 571, 575 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2008, pet. denied)). A party suing for breach of a\n\ncontract involving the sale of real estate must elect to sue either for money damages or specific\n\nperformance. Davis v. Luby, No. 04-09-00662-CV, 2010 WL 3160000, at *3 (Tex. App.—San\n\nAntonio Aug. 11, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.); Byram v. Scott, No. 03-07-00741-CV, 2009 WL\n\n1896076, at *3 (Tex. App.—Austin July 1, 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.). If the party sues for\n\ndamages, he has elected to treat the contract as terminated by the breach and to seek\n\ncompensation for that breach. Davis, 2010 WL 3160000, at *3; Byram, 2009 WL 1896076, at\n\n\n\n\n                                               –18–\n\f*3. If the party sues for specific performance, he affirms the contract and requests the trial court\n\nto effectuate the agreement. Davis, 2010 WL 3160000, at *3; Byram, 2009 WL 1896076, at *3.\n\n        The relief associated with specific performance may include monetary compensation in\n\nnarrow circumstances—when it is deemed necessary to place the parties in the same position as\n\nif the contract had been performed in full. Heritage Hous. Corp. v. Ferguson, 674 S.W.2d 363,\n\n366 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e.); Davis, 2010 WL 3160000, at *4.                 This\n\ncompensation is incident to a decree for specific performance and does not amount to legal\n\ndamages for breach of contract. Heritage Hous. Corp., 674 S.W.2d at 365. The rationale for the\n\ncompensation “is that the contract is being enforced retrospectively and the equities adjusted\n\naccordingly.” Id. Therefore, when a trial court orders specific performance of a contract to\n\npurchase real property, “the court will enforce the equities of the parties in such a manner as to\n\nput them as nearly as possible in the position they would have occupied had the conveyance been\n\nmade when required by the contract.”        Id. at 366.   The trial court, in order to relate the\n\nperformance back to the contract date, may equalize “any losses occasioned by the delay by\n\noffsetting them with money payments.” Id. The trial court, in a balancing of the equities, can\n\ninclude in this accounting items such as “rents, profits, delay costs, and like items.” Davis, 2010\n\nWL 3160000, at *4 (quoting Byram, 2009 WL 1896076, at *4).\n\n       In this case, the Olmsteads did not pursue their request for specific performance of the\n\ncontract and elected instead to recover money damages. Accordingly, the trial court could not\n\norder the contract to be performed and then balance the equities to award compensation that\n\nwould place the Olmsteads in the same position as if the contract had been timely performed.\n\nThe well-established case law on the trial court’s ability to perform an equitable accounting in a\n\nsuit for specific performance does not support the Olmsteads’ claim that they are entitled to\n\n\n\n\n                                               –19–\n\frecover the carrying costs of the Stanford house as monetary damages for the Goldmans’ breach\n\nof contract.\n\n          The Olmsteads also rely on the Austin Court of Appeals’ opinion in Barry to support\n\ntheir claim they can recover their carrying costs as consequential damages for the Goldmans’\n\nbreach of contract. In Barry, Michael P. Barry executed a contract to buy Donald and Karen\n\nJackson’s house for $370,000. Barry, 309 S.W.3d at 137. The Jacksons then executed a contract\n\nto buy another house. Id. Shortly after the Jackson’s option period on the new house expired,\n\nBarry notified them that he would not purchase their house. Id. The Jacksons lost the earnest\n\nmoney they deposited in conjunction with the contract on the new house, as well as an option-\n\nperiod fee and a fee to have the new house inspected. Id. More than a year after Barry breached\n\nthe contract, the Jacksons sold their house for $31,000 less than Barry had agreed to pay and\n\nwere required to pay more for repairs and closing costs than were associated with the contract\n\nwith Barry. Id. at 138. The Jacksons sued Barry for breach of contract. Id. The trial court\n\nawarded the Jacksons damages of $46,965 for breach of contract, $3,889 for “out of pocket\n\ndamages” and $23,165 in attorney’s fees. Id. at 138–39.\n\n          On appeal, the Austin Court of Appeals recognized the general measure of damages for\n\nthe breach of a contract to purchase real estate is the difference between the contract price and\n\nthe property’s value at the time of the breach. Id. at 140. The appellate court concluded the\n\nJacksons failed to present any evidence of the market value of the house at the time of the breach\n\nor that the sale price more than a year after the breach occurred within a reasonable time of the\n\nbreach. Id. at 141–42. Accordingly, the Jacksons could not recover the difference in price\n\nbetween the two contracts or the increased contract costs associated with the second contract. Id.\n\nat 142.\n\n\n\n\n                                              –20–\n\f       The court of appeals concluded the Jacksons were, however, entitled to recover the\n\nearnest money, option fee, and inspection costs that they lost when they were required to breach\n\nthe contract to purchase the new house. Id. The court noted the Jacksons:\n\n       presented ample evidence that they entered into the Pebble Garden contract due to\n       Barry’s signing of the contract and that they were forced to break the contract,\n       losing $3,889 in inspection fees, option fees, and earnest money, when Barry\n       informed them that he was breaching his contract too late for them to cancel the\n       Pebble Garden contract without penalty.\n\nId.\n\n       In Barry, the damages awarded to the Jacksons were all incurred on the date of Barry’s\n\nbreach and were directly related to the breach. In this case, the Olmsteads seek damages that\n\nwere incurred after the date of the breach, but claim the costs are recoverable because they\n\nflowed from the breach and were foreseeable on the date of the breach. However, the length of\n\ntime the Olmsteads would continue to own the house after the breach was not foreseeable on the\n\ndate of the breach, and we have found no case that allows a non-breaching seller of residential\n\nreal estate to recover its costs of ownership of the property from the date of the breach until the\n\nproperty is ultimately sold to another purchaser. Further, allowing such damages to be recovered\n\nas consequential damages for the breach of a contract to purchase residential real estate could\n\nincent the seller to hold the property indefinitely while waiting for market conditions to change,\n\nor for a purchaser willing to pay a specific price, because the seller knows his breaching buyer is\n\nresponsible for all costs the seller is incurring by continuing to own the property. We decline to\n\nchange well-established Texas law concerning the appropriate measure of damages for the\n\nbreach of a contract to purchase residential real estate by allowing the recovery of mortgage\n\ninterest, utilities, taxes, insurance, and lawn care paid by a non-breaching seller following the\n\nbreach of a contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                              –21–\n\f       Damages for breach of a contract to buy or sell real estate are “uncertain and not easily\n\nestimated with accuracy.” Chan v. Montebello Dev. Co., No. 14-06-00936-CV, 2008 WL\n\n2986379, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] July 31, 2008, pet. denied) (mem. op.)\n\n(quoting Thanksgiving Tower Partners v. Anros Thanksgiving Partners, 64 F.3d 227, 232 (5th\n\nCir. 1995)).   For this reason, when a buyer defaults, the seller may seek specific performance\n\n“or usually receives any earnest money and retains the value of the use and ownership of the\n\nproperty.” Barry, 309 S.W.3d at 140 n.8. Here, the Olmsteads declined to pursue either of these\n\noptions and sought to recover damages. Under Texas law, those damages are measured by the\n\ndifference between the contract price and the market value of the Stanford house on the date the\n\nGoldmans breached the contract. The evidence established there was no difference in the\n\ncontract price and the market value on the date the Goldmans breached the contract.\n\n       We conclude the trial court used an improper measure of damages and erred by awarding\n\nthe Olmsteads their carrying costs of the Stanford house for the year following the date of the\n\nbreach. Further, the Olmsteads failed to prove they suffered any damages under the correct legal\n\nmeasure of damages. Accordingly, we resolve the Goldmans’ fifth issue in their favor and\n\nrender judgment that the Olmsteads take nothing on their breach of contract claim against the\n\nGoldmans.\n\n                                       Rule 11 Agreement\n\n       In their fourth issue, the Goldmans argue the trial court erred by granting the Olmsteads’\n\nrequest to amend their petition in contravention of the parties’ rule 11 agreement.         In the\n\nOlmsteads’ fourth amended petition, the only factual allegations pertaining to the Olmsteads’\n\ndamages were that they were “substantial” and “in excess of the jurisdictional limits” of the trial\n\ncourt. Following the filing of the fourth amended petition, the parties entered into a rule 11\n\nagreement that, in the event the case went to trial as scheduled, the Olmsteads would not amend\n\n                                              –22–\n\ftheir petition to assert new factual allegations, but could amend to correct “technical defects.”\n\nOn the day of trial, the Olmsteads sought leave to file a fifth amended petition that asserted their\n\ndamages included “costs of ownership and maintenance of the Property such as mortgage\n\ninterest     payments,    homeowners’    insurance     payments,   utility   payments,   lost   rents,\n\ngroundskeeping, maintenance, and property taxes, until the property could be sold to alternate\n\nbuyers.” The trial court granted the Olmsteads’ request.\n\n           We have concluded the damages allowed by Texas law for the breach of a residential real\n\nestate contract do not include the damages sought by the Olmsteads and have rendered judgment\n\nthat the Olmsteads take nothing on their breach of contract claim. Accordingly, we need not\n\naddress whether the trial court erred by allowing the Olmsteads to amend their petition on the\n\nday of trial to plead for those damages. See TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n\n                                         Expert Testimony\n\n           In their sixth issue, the Goldmans contend the trial court erred by allowing the\n\nOlmsteads’ attorney and Hewett and NRT’s attorney to testify about the fees incurred in this case\n\nbecause the general substance of their testimony was not properly disclosed in response to the\n\nGoldmans’ requests for disclosure. We review a trial court’s decision to admit or exclude\n\nevidence for an abuse of discretion. Bay Area Healthcare Grp., Ltd. v. McShane, 239 S.W.3d\n\n231, 234 (Tex. 2007) (per curiam). The trial court abuses its discretion when it acts in an\n\nunreasonable and arbitrary manner, or without reference to any guiding rules or principles.\n\nDowner v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241–42 (Tex. 1985).\n\n           The Goldmans served pretrial requests for disclosures on both the Olmsteads and on\n\nHewett and NRT.          In response, the Olmsteads identified Maryann Brousseau and Cynthia\n\nDooley as experts on the issue of attorney’s fees and informed the Goldmans:\n\n           Ms. Brousseau is an attorney who has been licensed to practice law since\n           November 1984. Ms. Dooley is an attorney who has been licensed to practice law\n                                                –23–\n\f       since November 1992. Both Ms. Brousseau and Ms. Dooley are experts on the\n       reasonableness of attorneys’ fees in Dallas County, Texas. Ms. Brousseau and/or\n       Ms. Dooley will testify concerning the reasonableness of attorneys’ fees charged\n       in this case. Neither Ms. Brousseau nor Ms. Dooley has prepared a report.\n       Neither Ms. Brousseau nor Ms. Dooley has rendered an opinion on the\n       reasonableness of attorneys’ fees charged in this case, since the fees continue to\n       accrue. Ms. Brousseau and Ms. Dooley’s legal qualifications have been\n       produced.\n\nHewett and NRT identified Constance Ariagno and Shannon Conway as experts on the issue of\n\nattorney’s fees and informed the Goldmans:\n\n       Ms. Ariagno and/or Ms Conway are expected to testify regarding the necessity\n       and reasonableness of attorneys’ fees in this case up to trial and appeal.\n\n       Ms. Ariagno’s and Ms. Conway’s opinions are based on their years of experience,\n       personal participation in the lawsuit, and on the factors described in Texas\n       Disciplinary Rules of Professional Conduct that are applicable to this type of\n       action and its circumstances. Ms. Arigano’s and Ms. Conway’s current resumes\n       and bibliographies are available online at www.pattonboggs.com.\n\nThe Goldmans objected to both Dooley and Ariagno testifying on the ground the responses to the\n\nrequest for disclosure failed to disclose the general substance of their opinions. The trial court\n\noverruled the objections and Dooley testified as to the attorney’s fees incurred by the Olmsteads\n\nand Ariagno testified as to the attorney’s fees incurred by Hewett and NRT.\n\n       Rule of civil procedure 194.2(f) allows a party to request disclosure of the general\n\nsubstance of an expert’s mental impressions and opinions and a brief summary of the basis for\n\nthem. TEX. R. CIV. P. 194.2(f). In response to the Goldmans’ discovery requests, the Olmsteads\n\nand Hewett and NRT disclosed the identity of the attorneys who might testify about the\n\nrespective party’s attorney’s fees incurred in this case and about the reasonableness and necessity\n\nof the fees. These disclosures provided the Goldmans with the general substance of counsels’\n\nanticipated testimony. See Reynolds v. Nagely, 262 S.W.3d 521, 531 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008,\n\npet. denied); Hawkins v. Jones, No. 05-06-00139-CV, 2007 WL 2004913, at *2 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas July 12, 2007, pet. denied) (mem. op.). Further, both the Olmsteads and Hewett and NRT\n\n                                              –24–\n\fsought to recover attorney’s fees incurred throughout the litigation, which necessarily precluded\n\nopinions on the reasonableness and necessity of total fees at the time of the disclosures. This\n\nrecord supports a determination that the Olmsteads and Hewett and NRT sufficiently complied\n\nwith the disclosure rules. See Reynolds, 262 S.W.3d at 531; Hawkins, 2007 WL 2004913, at *2.\n\n           Further, implicit in the trial court’s overruling of the Goldmans’ objections and allowing\n\nDooley and Ariagno to testify is a finding of either good cause or lack of unfair surprise or undue\n\nprejudice. See Parker Plaza W., Ltd. v. Boniuk Invs., Ltd., 153 S.W.3d 729, 733–34 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2005, no pet.); Bellino v. Comm’n for Lawyer Discipline, 124 S.W.3d 380, 384\n\n(Tex. App.—Dallas 2003, pet. denied); see also TEX. R. CIV. P. 193.6(a). Based on the record\n\nbefore us, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by impliedly finding the\n\nGoldmans were not unfairly surprised by either the Olmsteads’ or Hewett and NRT’s failure to\n\ndisclose additional information. 5 We resolve the Goldmans’ sixth issue against them.\n\n                                            Attorney’s Fees to Hewett and NRT\n\n           In their eighth issue, the Goldmans argue the trial court erred by awarding Hewett and\n\nNRT attorney’s fees because they were not prevailing parties under the contract. Whether a\n\nparty is entitled to recover attorney’s fees is a question of law that we review de novo. Holland\n\nv. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 1 S.W.3d 91, 94 (Tex. 1999) (per curiam); Spector Gadon & Rosen,\n\nP.C. v. Sw. Securities, Inc., 372 S.W.3d 244, 248 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.)\n\n           In their third-party petition against Hewett and NRT, the Goldmans asserted claims\n\nagainst Hewett based on negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the DTPA, fraud in a\n\nreal estate transaction, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, and sought to hold NRT liable for\n\n\n5\n  We note the Goldmans could have filed a motion to compel under rule 215 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure to obtain more specific\ninformation, but failed to do so. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 215.1. Further, the calculation of the amount of attorney’s fees incurred by a party is not an\neconomic damage that is required to be disclosed in response to a request for disclosure. Jespersen v. Sweetwater Ranch Apartments, 390 S.W.3d\n644, 660–61 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      –25–\n\fHewett’s actions based on the doctrine of respondeat superior. The Goldmans sought to recover\n\nattorney’s fees based on their claims for violations of the DTPA and fraud in a real estate\n\ntransaction. See TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. §§ 17.50(d) (West 2011); 27.01(e) (West 2009).\n\n          In their answer, Hewett and NRT sought to recover attorney’s fees pursuant to section\n\n17.50(c) of the business and commerce code, alleging the Goldmans’ complaints under the\n\nDTPA were brought in bad faith or for purposes of harassment. Hewett also filed a counterclaim\n\nfor fraud against the Goldmans, and both Hewett and NRT filed a counterclaim seeking to\n\nrecover attorney’s fees from the Goldmans based on a provision in the contract for the Stanford\n\nhouse that states, “A Buyer, Seller, Listing Broker, Other Broker, or escrow agent who prevails\n\nin any legal proceeding related to this contract is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees\n\nand all costs of such proceeding.”\n\n          The trial court rendered judgment that the Goldmans take nothing on their claims against\n\nHewett and NRT and that Hewett take nothing on her fraud claim against the Goldmans. The\n\ntrial court found that Hewett and NRT were prevailing parties under the contract and the\n\nGoldmans were not prevailing parties. The trial court also found that Hewett and NRT had\n\nincurred reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees in the amount of $150,000 “in this legal\n\nproceeding related to the Contract” and would incur additional, contingent fees in the case of an\n\nappeal.\n\n          The Goldmans first argue Hewett and NRT are not entitled to recover under the provision\n\nin the contract regarding recovery of attorney’s fees because they did not enter into a brokerage\n\nagreement with the Goldmans until after the contract was executed and, therefore, are not “other\n\nbrokers” under the contract. The Goldmans’ briefing of this argument consists of six lines and\n\nfails to cite to any supporting authority. An appellant’s brief “must contain a clear and concise\n\nargument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.”\n\n                                               –26–\n\fTEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). Failure to cite applicable authority or provide substantive analysis\n\nwaives an issue on appeal. Huey v. Huey, 200 S.W.3d 851, 854 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, no\n\npet.). We conclude nothing is presented for our review on this argument. Id.\n\n       The Goldmans next contend that Hewett and NRT are not entitled to recover attorney’s\n\nfees because they are not prevailing parties under the contract. The Goldmans specifically argue\n\nthat, even though Hewett and NRT successfully defended against the Goldmans’ claims, they\n\nalso successfully defended against Hewett’s fraud claim. Therefore, the Goldmans assert, there\n\nis either no prevailing party or both parties are prevailing parties.\n\n       Texas’s common law has long followed the “American Rule” pursuant to which parties\n\nto litigation bear their own attorney’s fees unless such expenses are specifically made\n\nrecoverable by statute or contract. MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co., 292 S.W.3d\n\n660, 669 (Tex. 2009); see also Epps v. Fowler, 351 S.W.3d 862, 865 (Tex. 2011). In this case,\n\nthe contract for the sale of the Stanford house provided that the prevailing party in any legal\n\nproceeding related to the contract is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees.\n\n       A prevailing party is the party who successfully prosecutes a cause of action or defends\n\nagainst it. Silver Lion v. Dolphin St., Inc., No. 01-07-00370-CV, 2010 WL 2025749, at *18\n\n(Tex.

Here, the Goldmans have not challenged the trial court’s finding\n\nthat this case was a legal proceeding related to the contract for the sale of the Stanford house.\n\nHewett and NRT successfully defended the Goldmans’ claims and, therefore, are prevailing\n\nparties under the contract.

Because the Goldmans failed to plead\n\nfor the recovery of attorney’s fees under the contract, they waived any right to recover fees under\n\nthe contract. See Intercontinental Grp. P’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P., 295 S.W.3d 650,\n\n658–59 (Tex. 2009) (defendant waived right to recover fees under contract by not pleading for\n\nattorney’s fees under contract and not seeking to amend its pleadings to do so); Alan Reuber\n\nChevrolet, Inc. v.

A party seeking to recover attorney’s fees has\n\nthe burden to show that the fees were reasonable and necessary which, among other things,\n\nrequires the party to show the fees were incurred on a claim that allows recovery of such fees.\n\nStewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10–11 (Tex. 1991). When legal services\n\n                                              –28–\n\fadvance claims for which the recovery of fees is permitted and claims for which the recovery of\n\nfees is not permitted, the party must segregate and exclude the fees for services related to the\n\nclaims for which fees are not recoverable unless “the discrete legal services advance[d] both\n\n[the] recoverable claim and the unrecoverable claim.” Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212\n\nS.W.3d 299, 313–14 (Tex. 2006); see also Petras v. Criswell, 248 S.W.3d 471, 481 (Tex. App.—\n\nDallas 2008, no pet.).   The need to segregate fees is a question of law, while the extent to which\n\ncertain claims can or cannot be segregated is a mixed question of law and fact. Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P., 212 S.W.3d at 312–13.\n\n       The Olmsteads sought to recover attorney’s fees as the prevailing party on their breach of\n\ncontract claim. Over the Goldmans’ objection that she failed to segregate between recoverable\n\nand non-recoverable fees, Dooley testified the Olmsteads had incurred attorney’s fees and costs\n\nof $151,110.17 in their prosecution of the suit, which included both breach of contract and fraud\n\nclaims against the Goldmans. Dooley did not segregate the fees between the claims and did not\n\ntestify the claims were intertwined to the point of being inseparable. We have affirmed the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment that the Goldmans breached the contract to purchase the Stanford house but,\n\nbased on the Goldmans’ challenge to the trial court’s measure of damages, have rendered\n\njudgment that the Olmsteads recover nothing on their breach of contract claim against the\n\nGoldmans. Accordingly, there may no longer be recoverable fees on any of the Olmsteads’\n\nclaims. See Intercontinental Grp. P’ship, 295 S.W.3d at 655–56 (plaintiff who obtains finding\n\nthat defendant breached contract, but who does not recover any damages, is not prevailing party\n\nentitled to recover fees); Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P., 212 S.W.3d 304 (attorney’s fees not\n\nrecoverable on fraud claim).    Because our opinion in this case significantly changed the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment, we conclude the issue of the award of attorney’s fees to the Olmsteads must be\n\nreversed and remanded to the trial court for reconsideration in light of this opinion. See Wells\n\n                                               –29–\n\fFargo Bank Nw., N.A. v. RPK Capital XVI, L.L.C., 360 S.W.3d 691, 713 (Tex. App.—Dallas\n\n2012, no pet.); State Farm Lloyds v.

App.—Dallas 2001,\n\npet. denied).\n\n           Hewett and NRT sought attorney’s fees under the DTPA and under the contract. 6\n\nHowever, Hewett also asserted a claim against the Goldmans for fraud in obtaining the\n\nprequalification letter. Hewett’s fraud claim was based on conduct by Mark Goldman prior to\n\nthe execution of the contract and is not clearly based on the contract. Although Ariagno testified\n\nHewett and NRT had incurred $150,000 in reasonable attorney’s fees during the case, she did not\n\nsegregate the fees between the defense of the Goldmans’ claims and the prosecution of Hewett’s\n\nfraud claim. She also failed to testify the claims were so intertwined as to be inseparable. On\n\nthis record, we cannot say the recoverable fees were not required to be segregated from the\n\nunrecoverable fees. See CTMI, LLC v. Fischer, No. 05-11-01221-CV, 2013 2725580, at *2\n\n(Tex.

The Goldmans filed a third-party petition against Sandra\n\nHewett, the real estate agent who represented them in the transaction, asserting claims for\n\nnegligence, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA),\n\nfraud in a real estate transaction, common law fraud, and negligent misrepresentation, and\n\nagainst NRT Texas, L.L.C. (NRT), the broker with whom Hewett was associated, asserting it\n\nwas liable for Hewett’s actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior.     Hewett filed a\n\ncounterclaim against the Goldmans based on fraud.\n\n       The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the Olmsteads for damages in the amount of\n\n$56,929.85, plus attorney’s fees and costs of $151,110.17 and contingent attorney’s fees for\n\fappeal. The trial court also rendered judgment that the Goldmans take nothing on their claims\n\nagainst Hewett and NRT and that Hewett take nothing on her fraud claim against the Goldmans.\n\nThe trial court found that Hewett and NRT were prevailing parties under the terms of the\n\ncontract and rendered judgment that they recover $150,000 in attorney’s fees plus contingent\n\nfees for appeal.\n\n       In eight issues, the Goldmans assert the trial court erred by: (1) granting the Olmsteads’\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the Goldmans were liable for\n\nbreach of the contract; (2) denying the Goldmans’ competing motion for summary judgment; (3)\n\nrefusing to enter findings of fact and conclusions of law; (4) granting the Olmsteads’ motion for\n\nleave to amend their petition in contravention of a rule 11 agreement; (5) awarding carrying costs\n\non the property as damages; (6) allowing expert witnesses to testify when their opinions had not\n\nbeen fully disclosed; (7) awarding the Olmsteads attorney’s fees without requiring segregation\n\nbetween recoverable and non-recoverable fees; and (8) awarding Hewett and NRT attorney’s\n\nfees because they were not prevailing parties under the contract and failed to segregate\n\nrecoverable and non-recoverable fees. We reverse the trial court’s judgment in favor of the\n\nOlmsteads, render judgment that the Olmsteads take nothing on their claims against the\n\nGoldmans, and remand the issue of the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the Olmsteads.\n\nWe reverse and remand the issue of the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to Hewett and NRT.\n\nIn all other respects, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n                                            Background\n\n       In August 2009, the Goldmans requested that Hewett assist them with the purchase of a\n\nnew home. The Goldmans decided to make an offer to purchase a house at 3813 Stanford that\n\nwas owned by the Olmsteads (the Stanford house). The Goldmans obtained a prequalification\n\n\n\n\n                                                 –2–\n\fletter through Bank of America’s online process on September 21, 2009 to submit with the offer.\n\nThe Olmsteads agreed to sell the house to the Goldmans for $810,000.\n\n        On September 26, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads executed a One to Four Family\n\nResidential Contract, a form contract prepared by the Texas Real Estate Commission (TREC),\n\nfor the Goldmans to purchase the Stanford house. The contract provided for a ten-day option\n\nperiod during which the Goldmans could terminate the contract for any reason. It also provided\n\nfor a thirty-day option period during which the Goldmans could terminate the contract if, after\n\napplying for and making every reasonable effort to obtain financing on certain specified terms,\n\nthe Goldmans were unable to obtain financing for the purchase of the Stanford house. Mark\n\nGoldman “immediately” applied for a loan with Randolf Brooks Credit Union. On September\n\n27, 2009, the Olmsteads gave written notice to their tenants to vacate the Stanford house within\n\nthirty days.\n\n        On October 3, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads executed an amendment to the\n\ncontract that required the Olmsteads to pay $1,000 of the Goldmans’ closing costs in lieu of\n\nmaking certain repairs to the house. On October 5, 2009, the credit union declined to fund the\n\nGoldmans’ loan because their income was insufficient for the amount of credit requested and the\n\nloan could “over obligate” them. A credit union employee informed Mark Goldman that the loan\n\nwas declined because the Goldmans planned to continue to own their existing home following\n\nthe purchase of the Stanford house.\n\n        Mark Goldman then applied for a loan from Bank of America. In connection with the\n\napplication, Mark Goldman provided Bank of America with false information about his\n\nemployer and his monthly income. On October 13, 2009, the Goldmans’ loan officer at Bank of\n\nAmerica sent an email to Mark Goldman, with a copy to Hewett and to Sandy Smith, the\n\nOlmsteads’ real estate agent, stating the underwriter was “requiring a legible, fully executed\n\n                                              –3–\n\fcopy of the sales contract” and that the copy of the contract that Bank of America had was “very\n\nblurry.” The loan officer attached a “clean copy of the sales contract” to the email. On or\n\naround October 14, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads signed a “clean copy” of the contract.\n\n            The contract set a closing date of November 4, 2009. On November 4, 2009, the\n\nGoldmans and the Olmsteads agreed to amend the contract to extend the closing date to\n\nNovember 18, 2009. On November 9, 2009, Bank of America informed the Goldmans that it\n\nwas declining to fund the loan because it could not verify Mark Goldman’s income. Although\n\nMark Goldman applied for a loan from two other lenders, the Goldmans were not able to obtain\n\nfinancing to purchase the Stanford house. On November 12, 2009, the Goldmans executed a\n\nwritten notice terminating the contract based on their inability to obtain financing.\n\n            The Olmsteads sued the Goldmans for breach of contract, requesting specific\n\nperformance or, alternatively, damages. 1                             The Goldmans answered, raising a number of\n\naffirmative defenses. The Goldmans also filed a third-party petition against Hewett and NRT,\n\nasserting claims against Hewett for negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, violations of the DTPA,\n\nfraud in a real estate transaction, common law fraud, and negligent misrepresentation and\n\nseeking to hold NRT liable for Hewett’s actions under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\n\nHewett asserted a counterclaim against the Goldmans for fraud, alleging Mark Goldman\n\nprovided false information to Bank of America in order to obtain the prequalification letter. 2\n\n            The Olmsteads filed a motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of whether the\n\nGoldmans breached the contract. The Goldmans responded, and filed a competing motion for\n\nsummary judgment, on grounds they did not breach the contract because the contract was\n\n\n     1\n       In their first amended petition filed on June 14, 2010, the Olmsteads deleted their request for specific performance of the contract. In their\nsecond amended petition filed on April 8, 2011, the Olmsteads added claims based on fraud in a real estate transaction and common law fraud,\nbut abandoned these claims prior to trial. .\n     2\n         In November 2010, the Olmsteads sold the Stanford house to another buyer for $740,000.\n\n\n\n                                                                       –4–\n\funenforceable, void or voidable, or terminated on its own terms, and there had been a novation\n\nand the new contract was properly terminated based on the Goldmans’ inability to obtain\n\nfinancing. The trial court granted the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ndenied the Goldmans’ motion for summary judgment.\n\n       The amount of the Olmsteads’ damages for the Goldmans’ breach of the contract and the\n\nclaims between the Goldmans and Hewett and NRT were tried to the court. The trial court found\n\nthe Olmsteads’ damages for the breach were $56,929.85. It also determined the Olmsteads were\n\nprevailing parties under the contract and awarded the Olmsteads attorney’s fees and costs of\n\n$151,110.17 plus contingent attorney’s fees for appeal. The trial court rendered judgment that\n\nthe Goldmans take nothing on their claims against Hewett and NRT and that Hewett take nothing\n\non her claim against the Goldmans. The trial court also determined that Hewett and NRT were\n\nprevailing parties under the contract and awarded them attorney’s fees of $150,000 plus\n\ncontingent attorney’s fees for appeal.\n\n                                         Summary Judgment\n\n       In their first two issues, the Goldmans contend the trial court erred by granting the\n\nOlmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and denying the Goldmans’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment. We review a trial court’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.\n\nTravelers Ins. Co. v.

Id.\n\n       The Goldsteins do not dispute on appeal that the summary judgment evidence established\n\nthey executed a contract to purchase the Stanford house and failed to close the sale. Rather, they\n\nassert the trial erred by granting the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment and\n\ndenying their motion for summary judgment because (1) the contract fails to identify the sellers\n\nand material terms of the contract are otherwise illegible and, therefore, it is indefinite and\n\nunenforceable; (2) Smith failed to timely disclose that she is Summer Olmstead’s mother and,\n\ntherefore, the contract is against public policy and void; (3) the Olmsteads timely received notice\n\nfrom Bank of America that it would not approve the Goldmans’ loan application and, therefore,\n\nthe contract terminated on its own terms; and (4) there was a novation of the contract and the\n\nnew contract was properly terminated based on the Goldmans’ inability to obtain financing.\n\n                                      Indefinite and Illegible\n\n       The Goldmans first argue the contract was indefinite and, therefore, unenforceable\n\nbecause it is illegible and fails to identify the sellers.

If the terms of an alleged contract are so indefinite that it is\n\nimpossible for the courts to determine the rights and obligations of the parties, it is not an\n\nenforceable agreement. Effel, 339 S.W.3d at 792; see also Corilant Fin., L.P., 376 S.W.3d at\n\n256. “The rules regarding indefiniteness of material terms of a contract are based on the concept\n\nthat a party cannot accept an offer so as to form a contract unless the terms of that contract are\n\nreasonably certain.” City of Fort Worth, 22 S.W.3d at 846.\n\n        The Goldmans first assert the contract is indefinite because it is illegible. The summary\n\njudgment evidence reflects that, on September 26, 2009, the Goldmans and the Olmsteads\n\nexecuted a standard form contract promulgated by the TREC for the sale of the Stanford house to\n\nthe Goldmans for $810,000. The copy of the September 26, 2009 contract in the record is\n\ndifficult to read. However, Bank of America provided for signature a “clean copy” of the\n\ncontract in order to process the Goldmans’ loan application for the purchase of the Stanford\n\nhouse. The summary judgment evidence includes a “clean copy” of the contract signed on or\n\naround October 14, 2009 by the Goldmans and the Olmsteads for the sale of the Stanford\n\nproperty to the Goldmans for $810,000. Accordingly, the trial court could determine from the\n\nsummary judgment evidence the essential terms of the contract between the parties, and the\n\ncontract is not indefinite because it is illegible.\n\n        The Goldmans next contend the contract is indefinite and fails for lack of mutuality\n\nbecause the names of the sellers were not included on the first page of the contract. The contract\n\ncontains a blank on the first page for the names of the sellers. This blank was not completed in\n\neither the September 26 or the October 14 copies of the contract. However, both copies of the\n\n                                                      –7–\n\fcontract name Jeff Olmstead as the person to receive notifications for the sellers. The sellers\n\nalso provided an email address of olmstead.summer@gmail.com. Both Summer Olmstead and\n\nJeffrey Olmstead initialed each page of the contract and signed the contract in the appropriate\n\nlocations. We conclude the contract identified the sellers sufficiently to bind the Olmsteads and\n\nwas not indefinite due to a failure to identify the sellers.\n\n         The Goldmans finally argue that, because the contract is illegible and fails to identify the\n\nsellers, it fails under the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds provides that a contract for the\n\nsale of real estate is not enforceable unless it is in writing and signed by the person to be charged\n\nwith the agreement. TEX. BUS. & COM. CODE ANN. § 26.01(a), (b)(4) (West 2009). To comply\n\nwith the statute, the writing must contain the essential terms of the contract, expressed with such\n\ncertainty that they may be understood without resorting to oral testimony. Cohen v.

The contract for the sale of the Stanford house was in writing,\n\ncontained the essential terms of the agreement, and was signed by both the Olmsteads and the\n\nGoldmans.

The Goldmans contend this communication informed the\n\nOlmsteads that the Goldmans could not obtain financing and was received by the Olmsteads\n\nwithin the thirty-day period during which the contract could be terminated under the financing\n\ncontingency.\n\n       The financing contingency in the contract allowed the Goldmans to terminate the contract\n\nby written notice to the Olmsteads if, within thirty days after the effective date of the contract,\n\nthe Goldmans could not obtain financing approval on certain listed terms.

The Olmsteads moved for partial summary judgment on the\n\nGoldmans’ liability for breach of contract and specifically asserted that, as a matter of law, there\n\nhad not been a novation of the contract. The Olmsteads argued the October 14, 2009 contract\n\nwas a reiteration or retyping of the September 26, 2009 contract and “[b]y signing retyped pages\n\nof the Contract, the parties did not intend to restart the Financing Addendum deadline, extinguish\n\nthe Original Contract Document or Repair Amendment, or create a new contract.”                 The\n\nGoldmans responded to the Olmsteads’ motion for partial summary judgment, and also moved\n\nfor summary judgment, asserting the payment terms in the September 26, 2009 and the October\n\n14, 2009 contracts were inconsistent because the October 4, 2009 contract did not include the\n\n$1,000 repair credit.

The\n\nOlmsteads subsequently amended their petition and requested only damages for the breach.\n\n       At various points in the litigation, the Olmsteads sought damages based on the difference\n\nbetween the $810,000 the Goldmans agreed to pay for the Stanford house and the amount for\n\nwhich the house was ultimately sold, the loss of rental income resulting from the Olmsteads’\n\ntenants vacating the house, and the costs of carrying the house after the Goldmans breached the\n\ncontract. However, prior to trial, the Olmsteads dropped their claims for damages based on the\n\ndifference in the contract prices and for lost rents and, at trial, sought only to recover as actual\n\ndamages “their mortgage interest, utilities, taxes, insurance, and lawn care.” The Olmsteads\n\noffered evidence that between the time of the Goldmans’ breach and the sale of the Stanford\n\nhouse in November 2010, they paid $56,929.85 for mortgage interest, utilities, property taxes,\n\ninsurance, and yard maintenance for the Stanford house.\n\n\n\n\n                                               –16–\n\f          The Goldmans assert the proper measure of damages for breach of a residential real estate\n\ncontract is the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property on the\n\ndate of the breach and that the carrying costs recovered by the Olmsteads, while perhaps\n\nrecoverable as part of an equitable accounting in a suit for specific performance of the contract,\n\nare not recoverable in a suit for damages.\n\n          Generally, the measure of actual damages in a breach of contract case is the loss of the\n\nbenefit of the bargain, which would put the plaintiff in the same economic position he would\n\nhave been in had the contract actually been performed.

This\n\ncompensation is incident to a decree for specific performance and does not amount to legal\n\ndamages for breach of contract. Heritage Hous. Corp., 674 S.W.2d at 365. The rationale for the\n\ncompensation “is that the contract is being enforced retrospectively and the equities adjusted\n\naccordingly.” Id. Therefore, when a trial court orders specific performance of a contract to\n\npurchase real property, “the court will enforce the equities of the parties in such a manner as to\n\nput them as nearly as possible in the position they would have occupied had the conveyance been\n\nmade when required by the contract.”        Id. at 366.   The trial court, in order to relate the\n\nperformance back to the contract date, may equalize “any losses occasioned by the delay by\n\noffsetting them with money payments.” Id. The trial court, in a balancing of the equities, can\n\ninclude in this accounting items such as “rents, profits, delay costs, and like items.” Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3160000</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4 (quoting Byram, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1896076</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4).\n\n       In this case, the Olmsteads did not pursue their request for specific performance of the\n\ncontract and elected instead to recover money damages. Accordingly, the trial court could not\n\norder the contract to be performed and then balance the equities to award compensation that\n\nwould place the Olmsteads in the same position as if the contract had been timely performed.\n\nThe well-established case law on the trial court’s ability to perform an equitable accounting in a\n\nsuit for specific performance does not support the Olmsteads’ claim that they are entitled to\n\n\n\n\n                                               –19–\n\frecover the carrying costs of the Stanford house as monetary damages for the Goldmans’ breach\n\nof contract.\n\n          The Olmsteads also rely on the Austin Court of Appeals’ opinion in Barry to support\n\ntheir claim they can recover their carrying costs as consequential damages for the Goldmans’\n\nbreach of contract. In Barry, Michael P. Barry executed a contract to buy Donald and Karen\n\nJackson’s house for $370,000. Barry, 309 S.W.3d at 137. The Jacksons then executed a contract\n\nto buy another house. Id. Shortly after the Jackson’s option period on the new house expired,\n\nBarry notified them that he would not purchase their house. Id. The Jacksons lost the earnest\n\nmoney they deposited in conjunction with the contract on the new house, as well as an option-\n\nperiod fee and a fee to have the new house inspected. Id. More than a year after Barry breached\n\nthe contract, the Jacksons sold their house for $31,000 less than Barry had agreed to pay and\n\nwere required to pay more for repairs and closing costs than were associated with the contract\n\nwith Barry. Id. at 138. The Jacksons sued Barry for breach of contract. Id. The trial court\n\nawarded the Jacksons damages of $46,965 for breach of contract, $3,889 for “out of pocket\n\ndamages” and $23,165 in attorney’s fees. Id. at 138–39.\n\n          On appeal, the Austin Court of Appeals recognized the general measure of damages for\n\nthe breach of a contract to purchase real estate is the difference between the contract price and\n\nthe property’s value at the time of the breach. Id. at 140. The appellate court concluded the\n\nJacksons failed to present any evidence of the market value of the house at the time of the breach\n\nor that the sale price more than a year after the breach occurred within a reasonable time of the\n\nbreach. Id. at 141–42. Accordingly, the Jacksons could not recover the difference in price\n\nbetween the two contracts or the increased contract costs associated with the second contract. Id.\n\nat 142.\n\n\n\n\n                                              –20–\n\f       The court of appeals concluded the Jacksons were, however, entitled to recover the\n\nearnest money, option fee, and inspection costs that they lost when they were required to breach\n\nthe contract to purchase the new house. Id. The court noted the Jacksons:\n\n       presented ample evidence that they entered into the Pebble Garden contract due to\n       Barry’s signing of the contract and that they were forced to break the contract,\n       losing $3,889 in inspection fees, option fees, and earnest money, when Barry\n       informed them that he was breaching his contract too late for them to cancel the\n       Pebble Garden contract without penalty.\n\nId.\n\n       In Barry, the damages awarded to the Jacksons were all incurred on the date of Barry’s\n\nbreach and were directly related to the breach. In this case, the Olmsteads seek damages that\n\nwere incurred after the date of the breach, but claim the costs are recoverable because they\n\nflowed from the breach and were foreseeable on the date of the breach. However, the length of\n\ntime the Olmsteads would continue to own the house after the breach was not foreseeable on the\n\ndate of the breach, and we have found no case that allows a non-breaching seller of residential\n\nreal estate to recover its costs of ownership of the property from the date of the breach until the\n\nproperty is ultimately sold to another purchaser. Further, allowing such damages to be recovered\n\nas consequential damages for the breach of a contract to purchase residential real estate could\n\nincent the seller to hold the property indefinitely while waiting for market conditions to change,\n\nor for a purchaser willing to pay a specific price, because the seller knows his breaching buyer is\n\nresponsible for all costs the seller is incurring by continuing to own the property. We decline to\n\nchange well-established Texas law concerning the appropriate measure of damages for the\n\nbreach of a contract to purchase residential real estate by allowing the recovery of mortgage\n\ninterest, utilities, taxes, insurance, and lawn care paid by a non-breaching seller following the\n\nbreach of a contract.\n\n\n\n\n                                              –21–\n\f       Damages for breach of a contract to buy or sell real estate are “uncertain and not easily\n\nestimated with accuracy.” Chan v.

For this reason, when a buyer defaults, the seller may seek specific performance\n\n“or usually receives any earnest money and retains the value of the use and ownership of the\n\nproperty.” Barry, 309 S.W.3d at 140 n.8. Here, the Olmsteads declined to pursue either of these\n\noptions and sought to recover damages. Under Texas law, those damages are measured by the\n\ndifference between the contract price and the market value of the Stanford house on the date the\n\nGoldmans breached the contract. The evidence established there was no difference in the\n\ncontract price and the market value on the date the Goldmans breached the contract.\n\n       We conclude the trial court used an improper measure of damages and erred by awarding\n\nthe Olmsteads their carrying costs of the Stanford house for the year following the date of the\n\nbreach. Further, the Olmsteads failed to prove they suffered any damages under the correct legal\n\nmeasure of damages. Accordingly, we resolve the Goldmans’ fifth issue in their favor and\n\nrender judgment that the Olmsteads take nothing on their breach of contract claim against the\n\nGoldmans.\n\n                                       Rule 11 Agreement\n\n       In their fourth issue, the Goldmans argue the trial court erred by granting the Olmsteads’\n\nrequest to amend their petition in contravention of the parties’ rule 11 agreement.         In the\n\nOlmsteads’ fourth amended petition, the only factual allegations pertaining to the Olmsteads’\n\ndamages were that they were “substantial” and “in excess of the jurisdictional limits” of the trial\n\ncourt. Following the filing of the fourth amended petition, the parties entered into a rule 11\n\nagreement that, in the event the case went to trial as scheduled, the Olmsteads would not amend\n\n                                              –22–\n\ftheir petition to assert new factual allegations, but could amend to correct “technical defects.”\n\nOn the day of trial, the Olmsteads sought leave to file a fifth amended petition that asserted their\n\ndamages included “costs of ownership and maintenance of the Property such as mortgage\n\ninterest     payments,    homeowners’    insurance     payments,   utility   payments,   lost   rents,\n\ngroundskeeping, maintenance, and property taxes, until the property could be sold to alternate\n\nbuyers.” The trial court granted the Olmsteads’ request.\n\n           We have concluded the damages allowed by Texas law for the breach of a residential real\n\nestate contract do not include the damages sought by the Olmsteads and have rendered judgment\n\nthat the Olmsteads take nothing on their breach of contract claim. Accordingly, we need not\n\naddress whether the trial court erred by allowing the Olmsteads to amend their petition on the\n\nday of trial to plead for those damages. See TEX. R. APP.

CODE ANN. §§ 17.50(d) (West 2011); 27.01(e) (West 2009).\n\n          In their answer, Hewett and NRT sought to recover attorney’s fees pursuant to section\n\n17.50(c) of the business and commerce code, alleging the Goldmans’ complaints under the\n\nDTPA were brought in bad faith or for purposes of harassment. Hewett also filed a counterclaim\n\nfor fraud against the Goldmans, and both Hewett and NRT filed a counterclaim seeking to\n\nrecover attorney’s fees from the Goldmans based on a provision in the contract for the Stanford\n\nhouse that states, “A Buyer, Seller, Listing Broker, Other Broker, or escrow agent who prevails\n\nin any legal proceeding related to this contract is entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees\n\nand all costs of such proceeding.”\n\n          The trial court rendered judgment that the Goldmans take nothing on their claims against\n\nHewett and NRT and that Hewett take nothing on her fraud claim against the Goldmans. The\n\ntrial court found that Hewett and NRT were prevailing parties under the contract and the\n\nGoldmans were not prevailing parties. The trial court also found that Hewett and NRT had\n\nincurred reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees in the amount of $150,000 “in this legal\n\nproceeding related to the Contract” and would incur additional, contingent fees in the case of an\n\nappeal.\n\n          The Goldmans first argue Hewett and NRT are not entitled to recover under the provision\n\nin the contract regarding recovery of attorney’s fees because they did not enter into a brokerage\n\nagreement with the Goldmans until after the contract was executed and, therefore, are not “other\n\nbrokers” under the contract. The Goldmans’ briefing of this argument consists of six lines and\n\nfails to cite to any supporting authority. An appellant’s brief “must contain a clear and concise\n\nargument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.”\n\n                                               –26–\n\fTEX.

The Goldmans specifically argue\n\nthat, even though Hewett and NRT successfully defended against the Goldmans’ claims, they\n\nalso successfully defended against Hewett’s fraud claim.

Tony Gullo\n\nMotors I, L.P., 212 S.W.3d at 312–13.\n\n       The Olmsteads sought to recover attorney’s fees as the prevailing party on their breach of\n\ncontract claim. Over the Goldmans’ objection that she failed to segregate between recoverable\n\nand non-recoverable fees, Dooley testified the Olmsteads had incurred attorney’s fees and costs\n\nof $151,110.17 in their prosecution of the suit, which included both breach of contract and fraud\n\nclaims against the Goldmans. Dooley did not segregate the fees between the claims and did not\n\ntestify the claims were intertwined to the point of being inseparable. We have affirmed the trial\n\ncourt’s judgment that the Goldmans breached the contract to purchase the Stanford house but,\n\nbased on the Goldmans’ challenge to the trial court’s measure of damages, have rendered\n\njudgment that the Olmsteads recover nothing on their breach of contract claim against the\n\nGoldmans.
