Michael Segal and Near North\nInsurance Brokerage (NNIB) were charged in 27 counts\nof a 28-count fourth superseding indictment: Segal with\nracketeering, mail and wire fraud, false statements,\nembezzlement, and conspiring to impede the Internal\nRevenue Service; NNIB with mail and wire fraud, false\nstatements, and embezzlement. A jury returned guilty\nverdicts on all counts (except one which the government\ndismissed), but the district court (Judge Ruben Castillo)\ngranted a judgment of acquittal on 7, leaving a grand total\nof 19 standing at the end of the day. NNIB was ordered to\npay a $1.4 million fine and pay restitution totaling\n\f2                                 Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\n$841,517.96. Segal was sentenced to 121 months impris-\nonment, ordered to pay $841,527.96 in restitution, and\nforfeit $30 million and his interest in the racketeering\nenterprise.\n  Segal was a licensed attorney, a CPA, and an insurance\nbroker who began working for NNIB in 1964 when it was\nowned by George Dunne, a prominent politician and\npresident, for 21 years, of the Cook County Board. By the\nearly 1990s Segal was the owner and sole shareholder of\nthe company. He then formed NNNB, a holding company,\nto be the corporate parent of NNIB and many of his other\nfinancial interests. During the 1990s NNIB was earning\nclose to $50 million annually.\n  During the period covered by the indictment—1990-\n2002—Illinois law, as set out in 50 Ill. Admin. Code\n§ 3113.40(a), required insurance brokers to maintain a\npremium fund trust account (PFTA) into which all premi-\nums were to be deposited and held in a fiduciary capacity\nuntil the carriers demanded the premium payments. The\ntime between a broker’s receipt of premium payments\nand the carrier’s demand—called the “float’’—varied\nwith the carrier. Commissions, interest, credit, and other\nnonpremium money could be withdrawn, but brokers\nwere required to maintain PFTAs in trust with sufficient\nfunds to pay premiums. The accounts could not be used\nas operating accounts. Failure to properly maintain a\nPFTA was grounds for suspension or revocation of a\nbroker’s license. Conversion of more than $150 was a\nfelony.\n  NNIB maintained both a PFTA and an operating ac-\ncount, but everything was deposited in the PFTA, and the\noperating account was maintained with a zero balance.\nFunds were transferred to the operating account from the\nPFTA to pay expenses, but after those payments were\nmade everything was transferred back to the PFTA. The\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                    3\n\nchief financial officer of NNIB from 1990 to 1998, Norman\nPater, considered this practice to be a violation of the\nregulations, as did his successor, Donald Kendeigh, and,\nin turn, his successor, Thomas McNichols.\n  Nevertheless, Segal expanded his business, purchasing\nbrokerages in New York, California, Texas, and Florida. In\naddition, he purchased several other companies, ranging\nfrom a fire suppression device manufacturer to a soft-\nware maker. The acquisition of these entities was funded\nby NNIB’s PFTA. Most of the companies were losing\nmoney, so there were regular wire transfers from the\nPFTA to keep them solvent. By the end of 1989 the PFTA\nwas over $7 million out of trust. At the end of 1995 it\nwas $10 million short, and by August 2001 the deficit had\ngrown to $30 million. Evidence shows that Segal knew he\nwas converting PFTA money to fund expansion and for\nother unauthorized purposes. Auditors regularly told him\nso. Segal contended it was no big deal. He told McNichols\nthat every insurance company operates the way he did. In\nthe face of this sort of operation, the auditing firm\nMcGladrey & Pullen resigned, as had an earlier firm,\nDeloitte & Touche.\n  The cash shortfall in the PFTA was so bad in January\n2001 that Segal had the head of the NNIB branch in Los\nAngeles wire $3 million to cover payments which were\ndue to carriers. Reluctantly he wired the money on Janu-\nary 16; on the 22nd, $2.4 million was wired back to Los\nAngeles.\n  In April 2001, McNichols drafted a letter to Segal\noutlining an NNIB Management Operations Plan. Its\npurpose was to bring NNIB into compliance with the\nlaw. The plan proposed putting control of NNIB into an\nexecutive committee that would report to Segal but be free\nto act without his approval. The plan called for selling off\nmoney-losing affiliates, segregating PFTA from operating\n\f4                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nfunds, and obtaining an outside audit. The letter noted\nthat the PFTA was $17 million in deficit but that for\nyears Segal had shown no interest in balancing it, that\noutside auditors had quit because of the deficit, that\nSegal’s wife said Segal’s ties to the governor would pro-\ntect him, and that Segal was intentionally committing a\nfelony. Segal rejected the plan. But he retained Hales &\nCompany, financial consultants, to evaluate NNIB’s\nprospects of raising capital by attracting new investors.\nSoon after Hales was retained, its chief executive officer\nreceived a phone call from Segal saying that an anonymous\nletter had been sent to the Illinois Department of Insur-\nance (IDOI) reporting the PFTA deficit. The Hales vice-\npresident in charge of the account concluded that the\nPFTA was out of trust by $24 million—even after Segal\nput $10 million from a mortgage on his home into the\naccount. Hales secured loans for NNIB, and the situation\nwas finally corrected when Firemen’s Fund and AIG each\nloaned NNIB $10 million. The loans, however, came with\nrestrictions on Segal’s ability to dispose of assets, effec-\ntively taking control of NNIB out of his hands.\n  A less dramatic aspect of the situation involved petty\ncash. Dan Watkins, an employee in NNIB’s accounting\ndepartment, maintained a petty cash account of $20,000.\nA ledger was kept with strict accounting of even small\nwithdrawals for NNIB expenses. In contrast, every week,\nthousands were put in an envelope for Segal. Watkins\neventually pled guilty to embezzlement for his part in the\ntransactions.\n  NNIB often paid Segal’s personal credit card bills—to\nthe tune of $36,000 for the years 1999-2001. Employees of\nNNIB also performed personal services for him and his\nfamily. Evidence showed that between 1999 and 2001\nSegal had $667,000 in unreported income for the value of\nservices rendered.\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   5\n\n  In addition, Segal had employees make political contri-\nbutions with personal checks. NNIB then reimbursed\nthem. Segal also provided discounts on insurance premi-\nums for political figures.\n   One influential person helpful to Segal was Nathaniel\nShapo. Shapo’s first job out of college was interning for\nIllinois’ then-lieutenant governor, George Ryan. Shapo\nnext worked for Ryan when Ryan was the Illinois secretary\nof state. After Shapo graduated from law school he worked\non Ryan’s gubernatorial campaign. Ryan was elected and\nappointed Shapo, who was then six months out of law\nschool with no insurance background, as director of the\nIllinois Department of Insurance. Homer Ryan, the gover-\nnor’s son, introduced Segal to Shapo. When the previously\nmentioned anonymous tipster informed the IDOI of\nNNIB’s PFTA deficit, IDOI began an investigation.\nFortuitously for Segal, at that time he had a meeting\nscheduled with Shapo. Before the meeting, Governor\nRyan called Shapo to say he hoped things would go well\nfor NNIB, and after, called to ask how the meeting had\ngone. Shapo told Ryan that IDOI would not do an official\nexamination of NNIB because it would kill a $20 million\ndeal Segal had in the works.\n  Segal was also involved in providing insurance for the\nChicago Transit Authority’s reconstruction project on its\nBlue Line, a contract which NNIB was awarded. The\ncontract was fee-based; no commissions were to be paid to\nthe broker. However, before the contract was signed, Segal\narranged to have one of NNIB’s subsidiaries broker some\nof the coverages—and earn a commission of $370,000, an\narrangement not revealed to the CTA.\n  Finally, in what seems—in the context of this case—to\nbe almost a minor infraction, NNIB had a policy of writ-\ning off customer credits. After a credit owed to a customer\nhad been carried on the books for a while without a\n\f6                                Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\npayment demand, the credit was simply written off.\nAccount executives were trained not to notify customers\nthat they were owed credits. Segal personally approved of\nthese write-offs, and in the judgment against him he was\nordered to pay $471,000 in restitution to the victims.\n  Segal and NNIB have raised a number of issues on\nappeal. We begin with their claim that they were the\ntargets of vindictive prosecution. They contend that\nadditional charges were leveled against Segal and charges\nwere brought against NNIB in retaliation for their pur-\nsuit of civil remedies against former NNIB executives\nwho were cooperating with the government.\n   Before the present criminal case began, Segal and NNIB\nfiled suit in state court against former NNIB executives\nMatt Walsh and Dana Berry, alleging that they violated\nnoncompete clauses in their contracts with NNIB. After\nthat—but not because of it—the government charged\nSegal with one count of fraud; at that time no charges\nwere filed against NNIB. Then Segal and NNIB prepared\na draft amended complaint in their civil case and showed\nit to the prosecutors in the criminal case. The amendment\nalleged that Walsh and Berry illegally acquired propri-\netary information from a former NNIB information\ntechnologist, who had hacked into the company’s computer\nsystem. When shown the amended complaint, the prosecu-\ntor protested that the allegations were not made in good\nfaith and were intended to harass and intimidate Walsh\nand Berry, who were expected to be government wit-\nnesses. The prosecutor said that if the amended complaint\nwas filed, the government would take it into account in\ndeciding whether to bring charges against NNIB and to\ncharge Segal under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962 et seq. (RICO). The\namended complaint was filed and the grand jury re-\nturned superseding indictments doing just that. Claiming\nthat the additional charges were the result of vindictive\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                      7\n\nprosecution, Segal and NNIB moved to dismiss the indict-\nment. The district judge denied the motion without a\nhearing.\n  On a claim of vindictive prosecution, we review the\ndistrict court’s legal conclusions de novo and its findings of\nfact for clear error. United States v. Falcon, 347 F.3d 1000\n(7th Cir. 2003); United States v. Jarrett, 447 F.3d 520 (7th\nCir. 2006).\n  The Constitution prohibits initiating a prosecution based\nsolely on vindictiveness. “[F]or an agent of the [United\nStates] to pursue a course of action whose objective is to\npenalize a person’s reliance on his legal rights” is “a due\nprocess violation of the most basic sort . . . .”\nBordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 363 (1978); Jarrett,\n447 F.3d at 525. After a trial, in very limited circum-\nstances, courts have applied a burden-shifting presump-\ntion of vindictiveness where prosecutors have pursued\nenhanced charges after a defendant successfully chal-\nlenged a conviction and was awarded a new trial. But we\nstated in Jarrett that our precedents do not provide for the\napplication of such a presumption before trial. It remains\na fact that a pretrial claim of vindictive prosecution is\nextraordinarily difficult to prove. To prevail on this sort\nof claim, Jarrett holds that a defendant must affirmatively\nshow that the prosecutor was motivated by animus, “such\nas a personal stake in the outcome of the case or an\nattempt to seek self-vindication.” Id. And it must be\nrecognized, in reviewing a claim of vindictiveness be-\nfore trial, that prosecutors have “wide discretion over\nwhether, how, and when to bring a case.” Id. As the\nSupreme Court has said, “A prosecutor should remain free\nbefore trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to\nhim to determine the extent of the societal interest in\nprosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future\nconduct. As we made clear in Bordenkircher, the initial\n\f8                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\ncharges filed by a prosecutor may not reflect the extent to\nwhich an individual is legitimately subject to prosecution.”\nUnited States v. Goodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 382 (1982).\n  That the initial charges may not reflect the extent of\na defendant’s wrongdoing is clearly illustrated by the\nevidence in this case. It is hard to imagine that any\nprosecutor would fail to find NNIB a proper defendant or\nfail to conclude that Segal’s wrongdoing extended far\nbeyond one fraud count. The evidence supports the indict-\nment, and Segal and NNIB have not made a showing of\nvindictiveness. What they point to in an attempt to\nsupport the claim is a statement by a prosecutor that if\nthe defendants filed the amended complaint, that would\nbe taken into account in deciding on RICO charges and\ncharges against NNIB. The prosecutor’s statement was\nbased, however, on the belief that the allegations in the\namended civil complaint were not made in good faith\nbut, to the contrary, were intended to harass and intimi-\ndate government witnesses. A prosecutor cannot be said\nto act vindictively by taking into account a defendant’s\nperceived efforts to intimidate witnesses. In short, defen-\ndants have not made out a claim for vindictive prosecution,\nnor have they shown sufficient evidence to warrant a\nhearing on the claim.\n  Next, the defendants claim that there was a fatal\nvariance between the indictment and the proof at trial.\nThis claim fares no better. Specifically, they argue that\nthe evidence showed multiple schemes to defraud rather\nthan the single scheme charged in the indictment. We\ntreat such a claim as an attack on the sufficiency of the\nevidence, and we review the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the government. United States v. Olson, 450\nF.3d 655 (7th Cir. 2006).\n  Much summarized, the fourth superseding indictment\ncharged the defendants with a single scheme to defraud\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                     9\n\nand to obtain money and things of value from the PFTA\n(an account they were required to maintain for the\nbenefit of customers and insurance carriers) by creating\nthe false appearance that payments to NNIB would be held\nin trust for payment of premiums, that credits due custom-\ners would be refunded to them, and that the customers\nwould receive honest services. Rather than a single\nscheme, defendants contend that evidence at trial revealed\nthree separate schemes: failure to maintain sufficient\nfunds in the PFTA; writing off of customer credits; and\ncollection of a commission from the CTA contract for\nBlue Line renovation. The district court found that the\nevidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the fraudu-\nlent acts were all part of a single scheme. We agree.\n  As part of their argument on this point, the defendants\ncharacterize the misuse of the PFTA account as improper\nborrowing which did not actually harm anyone or benefit\nthem, certainly a benign interpretation of the facts. And\nthe law is otherwise. The unauthorized use of money\nfrom an insurance premium trust account is mail fraud\neven if the defendant did not gain and the victim did not\nlose. See United States v. Vincent, 416 F.3d 593 (7th Cir.\n2005). The claim that the carriers were at little risk\nignores the facts which show that NNIB was often late\nin paying carriers and had to hold checks to carriers\nuntil it came up with sufficient funds to send them out. By\n2001, NNIB had to obtain cash from affiliates to pay\npremiums and by the end of that year had to borrow $30\nmillion to meet its obligations. In addition, it is hard to\nsee how the defendants can contend that the credit write-\noffs were unrelated to the larger scheme. Withholding of\ncredits directly deprived customers of money they were\nowed and of the honest services of their broker. In addi-\ntion, it reduced the PFTA deficit, at least to some degree.\nProceeds from other acts, such as the CTA fraud, were\ncommingled in the PFTA and used for a variety of unau-\n\f10                                 Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nthorized purposes. Political contributions and premium\ndiscounts to influential people provided Segal with cover\nto prevent discovery of his financial shenanigans. In short,\nthe evidence supports a finding of an overarching scheme\ninvolving the misuse of the PFTA account, as alleged\nin the superseding indictment.\n  We turn next to the claim that the jury instructions\nregarding mail and wire fraud were improper. The defen-\ndants were convicted of fraud for depriving another of the\n“intangible right to honest services” pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1346. They contend that the jury instructions mis-\nstated the law and that there is a likelihood that the\ninstructions confused the jury into thinking the defendants\ncould be convicted for violations of Illinois insurance law.\nThe defendants further contend that state law is always\nirrelevant under the statute. Alternatively, they say that\nif state law is relevant, it was overemphasized in the\ninstructions. We review the instructions as a whole to\ndetermine whether they fairly treat the issues. United\nStates v. Murphy, 469 F.3d 1130 (7th Cir. 2006).\n  The argument that state law is always irrelevant in\ndetermining the scope of a fiduciary duty, the breach of\nwhich may give rise to a deprivation of honest services, is\nforeclosed by United States v. Bloom, 149 F.3d 649 (7th\nCir. 1998). Bloom makes clear that state laws are useful\nfor defining the scope of fiduciary duties, and that what\ndistinguishes a mere violation of fiduciary duty from a\nfederal fraud case is the misuse of one’s position for\nprivate gain.\n  Our conclusion is not altered by our decision in United\nStates v. Thompson, 484 F.3d 877 (7th Cir. 2007). Defen-\ndants argue that in Thompson we rejected the notion\nthat simple violations of administrative rules provide the\nbasis for a mail fraud conviction. In fact, what we said is\nthat there is a “potential to turn violations of state rules\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   11\n\ninto federal crimes,” at which point we explained that our\ndecision in Bloom specifically protects against that danger\nand remains the governing legal standard. The case\nagainst Thompson simply did not measure up.\n  Georgia Thompson was a state procurement officer who\nsteered a travel contract to the low bidder (who made legal\ncampaign contributions to an incumbent governor) even\nthough other people involved in the selection process rated\na rival company more highly. The theory of the prosecution\nwas that she deprived the state of her honest\nservices—that is, her “duty to implement state law the\nway the administrative code laid it down . . . .” The private\ngain—the Bloom requirement—was a tiny salary increase\nof $1,000 per year and an alleged improvement in her\njob security for pleasing her superiors who allegedly\nfavored the company she backed. We soundly rejected the\ngovernment’s theory. First, we found that Thompson\nalready had job security as a civil servant. We then\nanalyzed the case based on the assumption that she\nreceived the raise for steering the contract. Even using\nthat assumption, we concluded that “a raise approved\nthrough normal civil-service means is not the sort of\n‘private gain’ to which Bloom refers.” Thompson does not\nchange the Bloom rules, but merely reinforces them.\n  Furthermore, this case differs from Thompson in both\ndegree and in kind. The difference in degree hardly bears\nmentioning—a $30 million fraud versus a $1,000 per\nyear civil service raise. But, more importantly, it differs\nin kind. We concluded that Thompson did not act out of\nprivate gain, whereas Segal knowingly and intentionally\nmisused the PFTA for his own very significant private\ngain. Bloom remains the law in this circuit and Thompson\ndoes nothing to change the result in our case today.\n  As to the instructions, the jury was told that the defen-\ndants were charged with violations of various federal\n\f12                                   Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nlaws, including the mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeer-\ning laws. The instructions specifically state that the\ndefendants “are not charged in this case with any state\ncrimes or any violations of state regulations.” The jury\nwas told that it “should consider the following provisions\nof Illinois law . . . in determining the existence, the scope\nand the nature of defendants’ legal and fiduciary duties\nin this case.” The instructions also state:\n        To find defendants guilty of the charged federal\n     offenses, it is not enough to find that one or both of the\n     defendants violated Illinois law or the Illinois Insur-\n     ance Regulations. Your job is to decide whether the\n     government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n     every element of each federal offense charged in the\n     indictment based on the instructions I give you. Even\n     if you believe that the defendants violated Illinois law\n     or Illinois Insurance Regulations, you should return a\n     verdict of not guilty if you also believe that the govern-\n     ment has not proven every element of the particular\n     charged federal offense you are considering beyond a\n     reasonable doubt.\nThe defendants proposed an instruction, which was\nrejected, that the intent necessary to convict was the\nintent to defraud, not the intent to violate state law. Even\nthough the defendants’ specific proposed instruction was\nrejected, the jury was instructed that it had to find that\nthe defendants acted knowingly and with intent to de-\nfraud. “Scheme to defraud” and “intent to defraud” were\ndefined without any reference to state law. Viewed as a\nwhole, we find the instructions fairly informed the jury\nthat state law was to be used only to determine the nature\nof the defendants’ legal and fiduciary duties.\n  Segal also contends that the jury was not properly\ninstructed on the “pattern” element of the RICO charge.\nHe does not claim that the instructions which were given\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   13\n\nwere erroneous or that the evidence was insufficient to\nprove a pattern. But he wanted an instruction that “a\nmultiplicity of mailings or interstate communications\nmay be no indication of the requisite pattern or racketeer-\ning activity because each mailing or wire communication\nwas a separate offense and the number of offenses ‘does\nnot necessarily translate into a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.’ ” We reject his argument. In this case there are\nyears of false representations in various mail and wire\ncommunications. We have upheld convictions in similar\ncircumstances. In United States v. Genova, 333 F.3d 750,\n759 (7th Cir. 2003), we said that a jury could conclude that\nthe false mailings in that case were integral to the scheme\nand that “because the scheme extended over several years,\na jury also sensibly could find a pattern of racketeering.”\n  In the final challenge to the convictions, defendants\nclaim that their conviction of insurance fraud under 18\nU.S.C. § 1033(b) cannot stand because NNIB was not\n“engaged in the business of insurance” as required by the\nstatute. NNIB, defendants say, is an insurance broker, not\nan insurance provider.\n  The statute defined the “business of insurance” as the\nwriting of insurance or reinsuring of risks “by an insurer,\nincluding all acts necessary or incidental to such writing\nor reinsuring and the activities of persons who act as, or\nare, officers, directors, agents, or employees of insurers or\nwho are other persons authorized to act on behalf of such\npersons[.]” § 1033(f)(1). “Insurer” means “any entity the\nbusiness activity of which is the writing of insurance or\nthe reinsuring of risks . . . .” § 1033(f)(2). We have previ-\nously said that under Illinois law, an insurance broker, or\nagent of the insured is:\n    [o]ne who procures insurance and acts as middleman\n    between the insured and the insurer, and solicits\n    insurance business from the public under no employ-\n\f14                                   Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\n     ment from any special company, but, having secured\n     an order, places the insurance with the company\n     selected by the insured, or, in the absence of any\n     selection by him, with the company selected by such\n     broker.\nAmerican Ins. Corp. v. Sederes, 807 F.2d 1402, 1405 (7th\nCir. 1986), quoting Galiher v. Spates, 262 N.E.2d 626, 628\n(1970). Whether the broker is an agent of the insured or\nthe insurer is a question of fact and “[a]lthough an insur-\nance broker typically represents the insured, the broker\nmay also become the agent of the insurer or both parties.”\nCapitol Indemnity Corp. v. Stewart Smith Intermediaries,\nInc., 593 N.E.2d 872, 876 (Ill. App. 1992). Whether an\nentity is an agent of the company or the insured is deter-\nmined by its actions. The evidence in this case is suf-\nficient to support a finding that the defendants were\nengaged in the business of insurance as that term is\nbroadly defined in the statute to include “all acts neces-\nsary to incidental to such writing or reinsuring.”\n§ 1033(f)(1).\n  We now turn to issues involving the forfeiture and\nrestitution orders. Restitution was ordered against both\nSegal and NNIB in the amount of $841,527.96. They\ncontend the evidence did not support $542,2911 of that\namount. The latter amount was attributable to cred-\nits—due to customers—which were written off. Of that\namount, $357,079 was alleged to be owed but not paid to\nWaste Management. Segal presented an affidavit from\nWaste Management’s risk management director saying\nthat the sum was not owed to his company. But given\nother evidence, it was certainly possible that Waste\nManagement didn’t know it had credits coming.\n\n\n1\n  The uncontested amount is the restitution ordered to be paid\nto the CTA for the illegal commission on the Blue Line project.\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   15\n\n  We review the district court’s calculation of restitution\nfor abuse of discretion. United States v. Swanson, 394 F.3d\n520, 526 (7th Cir. 2005); United States v. Danford, 435\nF.3d 682 (7th Cir. 2006). We review the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the government. Olson, 450 F.3d\n655 (7th Cir. 2006). The government is required to prove\nthe entitlement to restitution by a preponderance of the\nevidence. In this case, the credits occurred in 1999, and the\nfindings regarding the victims and the amounts they\nwere owed were based on a report prepared by a govern-\nment auditor and attached to the government’s objec-\ntions to the presentence report. NNIB CFO McNichols\ntestified about a meeting with Segal in the fall of that year\nin which old, unclaimed credits were reviewed. Segal gave\ninstructions to write them off. Another witness testified\nthat if a client did not ask for the credit for a period of\ntime, it was written off. Including these unpaid credits in\nthe restitution order cannot be said to have been errone-\nous.\n  On the forfeiture issues, an initial matter involves\nSegal’s claim that he was prejudiced by his absence from\nthe hearing at which a preliminary forfeiture order was\nentered. We review the issue de novo, United States v.\nSmith, 31 F.3d 469 (7th Cir. 1994), to determine whether\nSegal’s due process rights were violated. A defendant\nhas a due process right to be present “ ‘whenever his\npresence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the\nfulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.’ ”\nUnited States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 526 (1985) (quoting\nSnyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97 (1934)). But “the\npresence of a defendant is a condition of due process to\nthe extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted\nby his absence, and to that extent only.” Snyder, 291 U.S.\nat 107-08. The determination is made in light of the record\nas a whole. United States v. McCoy, 8 F.3d 495 (7th Cir.\n1993). In this case, the hearing resulted only in a prelimi-\n\f16                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nnary order; the actual forfeiture was further litigated at\na later time. Segal’s counsel was at the hearing and no\ntestimony was taken. When addressing this issue at a\nlater proceeding, District Judge Castillo stated:\n       I have taken a close look at that particular issue,\n     and I’ve read the pleadings. The record I think is\n     reflected in the pleadings that have been filed very\n     ably and adequately by Mr. Segal’s counsel that\n     reflects that the preliminary forfeiture order was\n     entered without him being here. That was an over-\n     sight. As I said at the point in time when the prelimi-\n     nary forfeiture order was entered, if we had all had\n     our thinking caps on, that order should have been\n     entered at the point in time immediately following the\n     return of the verdict, but there was a lot of issues\n     going on, not the least of which was whether or not\n     Mr. Segal would be detained pending sentencing or\n     not.\n       That being the case, the record will reflect that\n     during the entire period from the point in time that\n     preliminary forfeiture order was entered until Mr.\n     Segal’s attorneys filed their written objection, I think\n     a period of 30 days, no issue was ever brought before\n     this Court by way of any—not even one- or two-para-\n     graph motion saying Mr. Segal should have been\n     present at the preliminary forfeiture proceeding. It\n     was never brought. And that the record will reflect.\n       The record will also reflect that it’s this Court’s\n     conclusion that Mr. Segal has been more than ade-\n     quately represented during that period of time and\n     that extensive objections have been filed to the pre-\n     liminary forfeiture proceeding.\nSo Judge Castillo concluded that if there was an error, it\ndid not prejudice Segal. We agree with that conclusion.\nFurthermore, there were almost countless hearings\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                    17\n\nregarding the forfeiture in this case, hearings at which\nSegal was present unless he voluntarily chose not to\nattend, as was the case on December 29, 2004. All in all,\nwe are not convinced that Segal’s due process rights were\nviolated when the preliminary forfeiture was entered.\n  Segal also raises issues regarding the forfeitures them-\nselves. 18 U.S.C. § 1963(a) provides that a person con-\nvicted of a RICO violation shall forfeit the enterprise\n“which the person has established, operated, controlled,\nconducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of\nsection 1962” and “any property constituting, or derived\nfrom, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly\nor indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt\ncollection . . . .” The judgment against Segal required the\nforfeiture of both.\n   As to the enterprise, Segal contends that it was error\nfor the court to set aside the jury verdict. The contention\nrequires some explanation. The “enterprise” in this case\nwas NNIB and related affiliates. Segal was the sole owner\nof the enterprise. The judge instructed the jury that\nSegal’s interest in the enterprise was subject to forfeiture\nto the extent the enterprise was tainted by racketeering\nactivity. The verdict form asked the jury to reply “yes” or\n“no” to the question whether Segal held an interest in the\nenterprise and, if so, what percentage of Segal’s inter-\nests were tainted. The jury replied “yes” and answered\nthe latter question 60 percent. However, the judge ordered\nforfeiture of 100 percent of the enterprise, thus the\nargument is that the “60 percent verdict” was set aside.\nThe court noted that under § 1963(a), Segal’s interest in\nthe enterprise subjected 100 percent of the enterprise to\nforfeiture. That is a correct conclusion. The error was in\nsubmitting the percentage question to the jury in the\nfirst place. The error, however, had no bearing on the case.\nThe fact is that the jury found that Segal had an interest\nin the enterprise. In fact, Segal owned the enterprise. The\n\f18                                 Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nevidence at trial to that effect was not simply sufficient,\nbut overwhelming. And § 1963 requires forfeiture of the\nenterprise.\n  Segal also objects to the forfeiture of $30 million in\nproceeds. He argues that there is a fatal variance between\nthe allegations of the indictment and the theory of forfei-\nture employed at his trial. He also contends that the\nevidence is insufficient to support the amount of the\nforfeiture.\n  The indictment charges that Segal’s interest subject to\nforfeiture is\n     at least $20,000,000, including but not limited to all\n     salary, bonuses, dividends, pension and profit sharing\n     benefits received by defendant MICHAEL SEGAL,\n     from NNIB and NNNG acquired and maintained\n     during the period 1990 through 2001.\nHe says that the indictment must be interpreted to mean\nthat only his executive salary of $120,000 per year, the\ncash he took from petty cash, and the claims for personal\nexpenses are subject to forfeiture. In addition, he says the\ngovernment must show what proportion of his executive\ncompensation consisted of racketeering proceeds. We\ncannot agree.\n  The items Segal mentions are, indeed, subject to forfei-\nture, but so is some of the money he stole from the PFTA.\nThere is no requirement that proceeds be in the form of\nmore-or-less legitimate salary payments or shady small\nreimbursements. While the indictment mentions salaries,\nbonuses, etc., it also says the forfeiture includes but is\nnot limited to those items and that “at least” $20,000,000\nis subject to forfeiture. In short, the indictment does not\nlimit the forfeiture to the specific items it mentions or\nthe ones Segal acknowledges. Assets forfeited as pro-\nceeds in Genova, a case on which Segal places considerable\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                    19\n\nreliance, included clearly illegal bribes, as well as seem-\ningly legitimate attorney fees. In fact, the defendant in\nGenova conceded that the bribes he received were subject\nto forfeiture. Here, the evidence is sufficient to show that\nmoney was stolen from the PFTA. It is also sufficient to\nshow what the amount was. The evidence shows a deficit\nwhich grew over the years. At the end of 1989 the PFTA\nwas over $7 million out of trust. At the end of 1995 it was\n$10 million short. Dennis Pogenburg of the Hales Groups\ntestified that in the fall of 2001 the deficit was $24\nmillion—after $10 million in borrowed money had been\ndeposited into the fund. McNichol testified that at the\nend of April 2001 the PFTA deficit was $29 million. By\nthe end of 2001, $30 million was borrowed to meet NNIB’s\npremium obligations.\n  Segal makes much of the fact that our cases require that\nproceeds forfeitures be of net, not gross, proceeds and that\nwhile restitution is loss based, forfeiture is gain based. He\nis correct about the legal principles, as Genova and United\nStates v. Masters, 924 F.2d 1362 (7th Cir. 1991), make\nclear, but wrong about the application to his case. Here,\nthe amount stolen is equal to the amount of the deficit.\nThe gain is equal to the loss.\n  Furthermore, the $30 million is net, not gross, proceeds\nto Segal. It is true that to collect the funds which went\n(briefly) into the PFTA, NNIB had expenses—employee\nsalaries, etc. But taking the money once it was there did\nnot cause Segal to incur expenses. He does not say, for\ninstance, that he paid someone to help him make off with\nthe funds. The expenses involved in the acquisition of the\n$30 million were borne by NNIB; the defendant from\nwhom the forfeiture is sought is Segal. To him, it was\nall net proceeds, figuratively, all gravy.\n Again, Genova may provide a loose analogy. Jerome\nGenova was the mayor of Calumet City, Illinois. He\n\f20                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nappointed Lawrence Gulotta as city prosecutor and\narranged for Gulotta’s law firm to get most of the city’s\nlegal business. Gulotta kicked back to Genova about 30\npercent of the payments the law firm received from the\ncity. The kickbacks were a cost of doing business and,\nbecause we require forfeiture on net proceeds, were\ndeducted from Gulotta’s forfeiture of his fees. However, the\nkickbacks were net proceeds to Genova. In Segal’s case,\nas well, the pilfered funds were net proceeds to him—if\nnot to NNIB.\n  Segal also argues, though, that he paid the money back,\nand apparently for that reason he thinks the $30 million\nis not subject to forfeiture. We have trouble seeing why\npaying the money back means that he did not take it in\nthe first place. More importantly, he did not personally\npay it back. He paid it back by borrowing from Firemen’s\nInsurance and AIG in loans, primarily secured by assets\nof the company.\n  All of that said, what is not clear from the record is how\nmuch of the $30 million was poured back into the enter-\nprise and how much went to benefit Segal personally.\nWithout that information we cannot determine whether\nat least part of the $30 million forfeiture would con-\nstitute double billing, given that the amount that went\nback into the company will be forfeited through the\nforfeiture of the enterprise. Double billing, as the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit has said, cannot be the\nintent of Congress:\n     We do not believe that Congress intended forfeiture\n     verdicts to double if property forfeitable under section\n     1963(a)(1) also happened to be forfeitable under\n     section 1963(a)(2). To read the statute to permit such\n     verdict doubling would introduce an arbitrariness\n     into the statute that could not have been contemplated\n     by Congress.\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   21\n\nUnited States v. Ofchinick, 883 F.2d 1172, 1182 (3rd Cir.\n1989). Accordingly, we will remand the case to the district\ncourt for a determination of what portion of the $30 million\nwas not reinvested in the enterprise, but rather went to\nbenefit Segal personally and is subject to forfeiture as\nproceeds of the illegal enterprise.\n  Finally, Segal argues that the forfeiture violates the\nExcessive Fines Clause of the Constitution. We review\nconstitutional questions de novo. United States v.\nKirschenbaum, 156 F.3d 784 (7th Cir. 1998).\n  In United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 334 (1998),\nthe Court held that “a punitive forfeiture violates the\nExcessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to\nthe gravity of a defendant’s offense.” It is true that the\nforfeiture is large. It is only excessive, however, if it is\ndisproportional to the offense. We cannot say that it was.\nThis was a massive fraud. When a defendant commits a\nmultimillion-dollar crime, he can be required to forfeit\nassets also running into the millions.\n  For all these reasons, the judgment of forfeiture of the\nproceeds of the racketeering activity is VACATED and\nREMANDED for further proceedings in the district court.\nIn all other respects, the judgments against Segal and\nNNIB are AFFIRMED.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—8-2-07\n\f",

Michael Segal and Near North\nInsurance Brokerage (NNIB) were charged in 27 counts\nof a 28-count fourth superseding indictment: Segal with\nracketeering, mail and wire fraud, false statements,\nembezzlement, and conspiring to impede the Internal\nRevenue Service; NNIB with mail and wire fraud, false\nstatements, and embezzlement. A jury returned guilty\nverdicts on all counts (except one which the government\ndismissed), but the district court (Judge Ruben Castillo)\ngranted a judgment of acquittal on 7, leaving a grand total\nof 19 standing at the end of the day. NNIB was ordered to\npay a $1.4 million fine and pay restitution totaling\n\f2                                 Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\n$841,517.96. Segal was sentenced to 121 months impris-\nonment, ordered to pay $841,527.96 in restitution, and\nforfeit $30 million and his interest in the racketeering\nenterprise.\n  Segal was a licensed attorney, a CPA, and an insurance\nbroker who began working for NNIB in 1964 when it was\nowned by George Dunne, a prominent politician and\npresident, for 21 years, of the Cook County Board. By the\nearly 1990s Segal was the owner and sole shareholder of\nthe company. He then formed NNNB, a holding company,\nto be the corporate parent of NNIB and many of his other\nfinancial interests. During the 1990s NNIB was earning\nclose to $50 million annually.\n  During the period covered by the indictment—1990-\n2002—Illinois law, as set out in 50 Ill. Admin. Code\n§ 3113.40(a), required insurance brokers to maintain a\npremium fund trust account (PFTA) into which all premi-\nums were to be deposited and held in a fiduciary capacity\nuntil the carriers demanded the premium payments. The\ntime between a broker’s receipt of premium payments\nand the carrier’s demand—called the “float’’—varied\nwith the carrier. Commissions, interest, credit, and other\nnonpremium money could be withdrawn, but brokers\nwere required to maintain PFTAs in trust with sufficient\nfunds to pay premiums. The accounts could not be used\nas operating accounts. Failure to properly maintain a\nPFTA was grounds for suspension or revocation of a\nbroker’s license. Conversion of more than $150 was a\nfelony.\n  NNIB maintained both a PFTA and an operating ac-\ncount, but everything was deposited in the PFTA, and the\noperating account was maintained with a zero balance.\nFunds were transferred to the operating account from the\nPFTA to pay expenses, but after those payments were\nmade everything was transferred back to the PFTA. The\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                    3\n\nchief financial officer of NNIB from 1990 to 1998, Norman\nPater, considered this practice to be a violation of the\nregulations, as did his successor, Donald Kendeigh, and,\nin turn, his successor, Thomas McNichols.\n  Nevertheless, Segal expanded his business, purchasing\nbrokerages in New York, California, Texas, and Florida. In\naddition, he purchased several other companies, ranging\nfrom a fire suppression device manufacturer to a soft-\nware maker. The acquisition of these entities was funded\nby NNIB’s PFTA. Most of the companies were losing\nmoney, so there were regular wire transfers from the\nPFTA to keep them solvent. By the end of 1989 the PFTA\nwas over $7 million out of trust. At the end of 1995 it\nwas $10 million short, and by August 2001 the deficit had\ngrown to $30 million. Evidence shows that Segal knew he\nwas converting PFTA money to fund expansion and for\nother unauthorized purposes. Auditors regularly told him\nso. Segal contended it was no big deal. He told McNichols\nthat every insurance company operates the way he did. In\nthe face of this sort of operation, the auditing firm\nMcGladrey & Pullen resigned, as had an earlier firm,\nDeloitte & Touche.\n  The cash shortfall in the PFTA was so bad in January\n2001 that Segal had the head of the NNIB branch in Los\nAngeles wire $3 million to cover payments which were\ndue to carriers. Reluctantly he wired the money on Janu-\nary 16; on the 22nd, $2.4 million was wired back to Los\nAngeles.\n  In April 2001, McNichols drafted a letter to Segal\noutlining an NNIB Management Operations Plan. Its\npurpose was to bring NNIB into compliance with the\nlaw. The plan proposed putting control of NNIB into an\nexecutive committee that would report to Segal but be free\nto act without his approval. The plan called for selling off\nmoney-losing affiliates, segregating PFTA from operating\n\f4                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nfunds, and obtaining an outside audit. The letter noted\nthat the PFTA was $17 million in deficit but that for\nyears Segal had shown no interest in balancing it, that\noutside auditors had quit because of the deficit, that\nSegal’s wife said Segal’s ties to the governor would pro-\ntect him, and that Segal was intentionally committing a\nfelony. Segal rejected the plan. But he retained Hales &\nCompany, financial consultants, to evaluate NNIB’s\nprospects of raising capital by attracting new investors.\nSoon after Hales was retained, its chief executive officer\nreceived a phone call from Segal saying that an anonymous\nletter had been sent to the Illinois Department of Insur-\nance (IDOI) reporting the PFTA deficit. The Hales vice-\npresident in charge of the account concluded that the\nPFTA was out of trust by $24 million—even after Segal\nput $10 million from a mortgage on his home into the\naccount. Hales secured loans for NNIB, and the situation\nwas finally corrected when Firemen’s Fund and AIG each\nloaned NNIB $10 million. The loans, however, came with\nrestrictions on Segal’s ability to dispose of assets, effec-\ntively taking control of NNIB out of his hands.\n  A less dramatic aspect of the situation involved petty\ncash. Dan Watkins, an employee in NNIB’s accounting\ndepartment, maintained a petty cash account of $20,000.\nA ledger was kept with strict accounting of even small\nwithdrawals for NNIB expenses. In contrast, every week,\nthousands were put in an envelope for Segal. Watkins\neventually pled guilty to embezzlement for his part in the\ntransactions.\n  NNIB often paid Segal’s personal credit card bills—to\nthe tune of $36,000 for the years 1999-2001. Employees of\nNNIB also performed personal services for him and his\nfamily. Evidence showed that between 1999 and 2001\nSegal had $667,000 in unreported income for the value of\nservices rendered.\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   5\n\n  In addition, Segal had employees make political contri-\nbutions with personal checks. NNIB then reimbursed\nthem. Segal also provided discounts on insurance premi-\nums for political figures.\n   One influential person helpful to Segal was Nathaniel\nShapo. Shapo’s first job out of college was interning for\nIllinois’ then-lieutenant governor, George Ryan. Shapo\nnext worked for Ryan when Ryan was the Illinois secretary\nof state. After Shapo graduated from law school he worked\non Ryan’s gubernatorial campaign. Ryan was elected and\nappointed Shapo, who was then six months out of law\nschool with no insurance background, as director of the\nIllinois Department of Insurance. Homer Ryan, the gover-\nnor’s son, introduced Segal to Shapo. When the previously\nmentioned anonymous tipster informed the IDOI of\nNNIB’s PFTA deficit, IDOI began an investigation.\nFortuitously for Segal, at that time he had a meeting\nscheduled with Shapo. Before the meeting, Governor\nRyan called Shapo to say he hoped things would go well\nfor NNIB, and after, called to ask how the meeting had\ngone. Shapo told Ryan that IDOI would not do an official\nexamination of NNIB because it would kill a $20 million\ndeal Segal had in the works.\n  Segal was also involved in providing insurance for the\nChicago Transit Authority’s reconstruction project on its\nBlue Line, a contract which NNIB was awarded. The\ncontract was fee-based; no commissions were to be paid to\nthe broker. However, before the contract was signed, Segal\narranged to have one of NNIB’s subsidiaries broker some\nof the coverages—and earn a commission of $370,000, an\narrangement not revealed to the CTA.\n  Finally, in what seems—in the context of this case—to\nbe almost a minor infraction, NNIB had a policy of writ-\ning off customer credits. After a credit owed to a customer\nhad been carried on the books for a while without a\n\f6                                Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\npayment demand, the credit was simply written off.\nAccount executives were trained not to notify customers\nthat they were owed credits. Segal personally approved of\nthese write-offs, and in the judgment against him he was\nordered to pay $471,000 in restitution to the victims.\n  Segal and NNIB have raised a number of issues on\nappeal. We begin with their claim that they were the\ntargets of vindictive prosecution. They contend that\nadditional charges were leveled against Segal and charges\nwere brought against NNIB in retaliation for their pur-\nsuit of civil remedies against former NNIB executives\nwho were cooperating with the government.\n   Before the present criminal case began, Segal and NNIB\nfiled suit in state court against former NNIB executives\nMatt Walsh and Dana Berry, alleging that they violated\nnoncompete clauses in their contracts with NNIB. After\nthat—but not because of it—the government charged\nSegal with one count of fraud; at that time no charges\nwere filed against NNIB. Then Segal and NNIB prepared\na draft amended complaint in their civil case and showed\nit to the prosecutors in the criminal case. The amendment\nalleged that Walsh and Berry illegally acquired propri-\netary information from a former NNIB information\ntechnologist, who had hacked into the company’s computer\nsystem. When shown the amended complaint, the prosecu-\ntor protested that the allegations were not made in good\nfaith and were intended to harass and intimidate Walsh\nand Berry, who were expected to be government wit-\nnesses. The prosecutor said that if the amended complaint\nwas filed, the government would take it into account in\ndeciding whether to bring charges against NNIB and to\ncharge Segal under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt\nOrganizations Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962 et seq. (RICO). The\namended complaint was filed and the grand jury re-\nturned superseding indictments doing just that. Claiming\nthat the additional charges were the result of vindictive\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                      7\n\nprosecution, Segal and NNIB moved to dismiss the indict-\nment. The district judge denied the motion without a\nhearing.\n  On a claim of vindictive prosecution, we review the\ndistrict court’s legal conclusions de novo and its findings of\nfact for clear error.

After a trial, in very limited circum-\nstances, courts have applied a burden-shifting presump-\ntion of vindictiveness where prosecutors have pursued\nenhanced charges after a defendant successfully chal-\nlenged a conviction and was awarded a new trial. But we\nstated in Jarrett that our precedents do not provide for the\napplication of such a presumption before trial. It remains\na fact that a pretrial claim of vindictive prosecution is\nextraordinarily difficult to prove. To prevail on this sort\nof claim, Jarrett holds that a defendant must affirmatively\nshow that the prosecutor was motivated by animus, “such\nas a personal stake in the outcome of the case or an\nattempt to seek self-vindication.” Id. And it must be\nrecognized, in reviewing a claim of vindictiveness be-\nfore trial, that prosecutors have “wide discretion over\nwhether, how, and when to bring a case.” Id. As the\nSupreme Court has said, “A prosecutor should remain free\nbefore trial to exercise the broad discretion entrusted to\nhim to determine the extent of the societal interest in\nprosecution. An initial decision should not freeze future\nconduct. As we made clear in Bordenkircher, the initial\n\f8                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\ncharges filed by a prosecutor may not reflect the extent to\nwhich an individual is legitimately subject to prosecution.”\nUnited States v. Goodwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110748\"><a href=\"/opinion/110748/united-states-v-goodwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382 (1982).\n  That the initial charges may not reflect the extent of\na defendant’s wrongdoing is clearly illustrated by the\nevidence in this case. It is hard to imagine that any\nprosecutor would fail to find NNIB a proper defendant or\nfail to conclude that Segal’s wrongdoing extended far\nbeyond one fraud count. The evidence supports the indict-\nment, and Segal and NNIB have not made a showing of\nvindictiveness. What they point to in an attempt to\nsupport the claim is a statement by a prosecutor that if\nthe defendants filed the amended complaint, that would\nbe taken into account in deciding on RICO charges and\ncharges against NNIB. The prosecutor’s statement was\nbased, however, on the belief that the allegations in the\namended civil complaint were not made in good faith\nbut, to the contrary, were intended to harass and intimi-\ndate government witnesses. A prosecutor cannot be said\nto act vindictively by taking into account a defendant’s\nperceived efforts to intimidate witnesses. In short, defen-\ndants have not made out a claim for vindictive prosecution,\nnor have they shown sufficient evidence to warrant a\nhearing on the claim.\n  Next, the defendants claim that there was a fatal\nvariance between the indictment and the proof at trial.\nThis claim fares no better. Specifically, they argue that\nthe evidence showed multiple schemes to defraud rather\nthan the single scheme charged in the indictment. We\ntreat such a claim as an attack on the sufficiency of the\nevidence, and we review the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the government. United States v. Olson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794597\"><a href=\"/opinion/794597/united-states-v-larry-olson-also-known-as-oreo-andrew-acosta-also-known/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2006).\n  Much summarized, the fourth superseding indictment\ncharged the defendants with a single scheme to defraud\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                     9\n\nand to obtain money and things of value from the PFTA\n(an account they were required to maintain for the\nbenefit of customers and insurance carriers) by creating\nthe false appearance that payments to NNIB would be held\nin trust for payment of premiums, that credits due custom-\ners would be refunded to them, and that the customers\nwould receive honest services. Rather than a single\nscheme, defendants contend that evidence at trial revealed\nthree separate schemes: failure to maintain sufficient\nfunds in the PFTA; writing off of customer credits; and\ncollection of a commission from the CTA contract for\nBlue Line renovation. The district court found that the\nevidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the fraudu-\nlent acts were all part of a single scheme. We agree.\n  As part of their argument on this point, the defendants\ncharacterize the misuse of the PFTA account as improper\nborrowing which did not actually harm anyone or benefit\nthem, certainly a benign interpretation of the facts. And\nthe law is otherwise. The unauthorized use of money\nfrom an insurance premium trust account is mail fraud\neven if the defendant did not gain and the victim did not\nlose. See United States v. Vincent, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791174\"><a href=\"/opinion/791174/united-states-v-mark-k-vincent/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir.\n2005). The claim that the carriers were at little risk\nignores the facts which show that NNIB was often late\nin paying carriers and had to hold checks to carriers\nuntil it came up with sufficient funds to send them out. By\n2001, NNIB had to obtain cash from affiliates to pay\npremiums and by the end of that year had to borrow $30\nmillion to meet its obligations. In addition, it is hard to\nsee how the defendants can contend that the credit write-\noffs were unrelated to the larger scheme. Withholding of\ncredits directly deprived customers of money they were\nowed and of the honest services of their broker. In addi-\ntion, it reduced the PFTA deficit, at least to some degree.\nProceeds from other acts, such as the CTA fraud, were\ncommingled in the PFTA and used for a variety of unau-\n\f10                                 Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nthorized purposes. Political contributions and premium\ndiscounts to influential people provided Segal with cover\nto prevent discovery of his financial shenanigans. In short,\nthe evidence supports a finding of an overarching scheme\ninvolving the misuse of the PFTA account, as alleged\nin the superseding indictment.\n  We turn next to the claim that the jury instructions\nregarding mail and wire fraud were improper. The defen-\ndants were convicted of fraud for depriving another of the\n“intangible right to honest services” pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1346. They contend that the jury instructions mis-\nstated the law and that there is a likelihood that the\ninstructions confused the jury into thinking the defendants\ncould be convicted for violations of Illinois insurance law.\nThe defendants further contend that state law is always\nirrelevant under the statute. Alternatively, they say that\nif state law is relevant, it was overemphasized in the\ninstructions. We review the instructions as a whole to\ndetermine whether they fairly treat the issues. United\nStates v. Murphy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796103\"><a href=\"/opinion/796103/united-states-v-glen-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2006).\n  The argument that state law is always irrelevant in\ndetermining the scope of a fiduciary duty, the breach of\nwhich may give rise to a deprivation of honest services, is\nforeclosed by United States v. Bloom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755829\"><a href=\"/opinion/755829/united-states-v-lawrence-s-bloom/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">649</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1998). Bloom makes clear that state laws are useful\nfor defining the scope of fiduciary duties, and that what\ndistinguishes a mere violation of fiduciary duty from a\nfederal fraud case is the misuse of one’s position for\nprivate gain.\n  Our conclusion is not altered by our decision in United\nStates v. Thompson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797582\"><a href=\"/opinion/797582/united-states-v-georgia-l-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2007). Defen-\ndants argue that in Thompson we rejected the notion\nthat simple violations of administrative rules provide the\nbasis for a mail fraud conviction. In fact, what we said is\nthat there is a “potential to turn violations of state rules\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   11\n\ninto federal crimes,” at which point we explained that our\ndecision in Bloom specifically protects against that danger\nand remains the governing legal standard. The case\nagainst Thompson simply did not measure up.\n  Georgia Thompson was a state procurement officer who\nsteered a travel contract to the low bidder (who made legal\ncampaign contributions to an incumbent governor) even\nthough other people involved in the selection process rated\na rival company more highly. The theory of the prosecution\nwas that she deprived the state of her honest\nservices—that is, her “duty to implement state law the\nway the administrative code laid it down . . . .” The private\ngain—the Bloom requirement—was a tiny salary increase\nof $1,000 per year and an alleged improvement in her\njob security for pleasing her superiors who allegedly\nfavored the company she backed. We soundly rejected the\ngovernment’s theory. First, we found that Thompson\nalready had job security as a civil servant. We then\nanalyzed the case based on the assumption that she\nreceived the raise for steering the contract. Even using\nthat assumption, we concluded that “a raise approved\nthrough normal civil-service means is not the sort of\n‘private gain’ to which Bloom refers.” Thompson does not\nchange the Bloom rules, but merely reinforces them.\n  Furthermore, this case differs from Thompson in both\ndegree and in kind. The difference in degree hardly bears\nmentioning—a $30 million fraud versus a $1,000 per\nyear civil service raise. But, more importantly, it differs\nin kind. We concluded that Thompson did not act out of\nprivate gain, whereas Segal knowingly and intentionally\nmisused the PFTA for his own very significant private\ngain. Bloom remains the law in this circuit and Thompson\ndoes nothing to change the result in our case today.\n  As to the instructions, the jury was told that the defen-\ndants were charged with violations of various federal\n\f12                                   Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nlaws, including the mail fraud, wire fraud, and racketeer-\ning laws. The instructions specifically state that the\ndefendants “are not charged in this case with any state\ncrimes or any violations of state regulations.” The jury\nwas told that it “should consider the following provisions\nof Illinois law . . . in determining the existence, the scope\nand the nature of defendants’ legal and fiduciary duties\nin this case.” The instructions also state:\n        To find defendants guilty of the charged federal\n     offenses, it is not enough to find that one or both of the\n     defendants violated Illinois law or the Illinois Insur-\n     ance Regulations. Your job is to decide whether the\n     government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt\n     every element of each federal offense charged in the\n     indictment based on the instructions I give you. Even\n     if you believe that the defendants violated Illinois law\n     or Illinois Insurance Regulations, you should return a\n     verdict of not guilty if you also believe that the govern-\n     ment has not proven every element of the particular\n     charged federal offense you are considering beyond a\n     reasonable doubt.\nThe defendants proposed an instruction, which was\nrejected, that the intent necessary to convict was the\nintent to defraud, not the intent to violate state law. Even\nthough the defendants’ specific proposed instruction was\nrejected, the jury was instructed that it had to find that\nthe defendants acted knowingly and with intent to de-\nfraud. “Scheme to defraud” and “intent to defraud” were\ndefined without any reference to state law. Viewed as a\nwhole, we find the instructions fairly informed the jury\nthat state law was to be used only to determine the nature\nof the defendants’ legal and fiduciary duties.\n  Segal also contends that the jury was not properly\ninstructed on the “pattern” element of the RICO charge.\nHe does not claim that the instructions which were given\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   13\n\nwere erroneous or that the evidence was insufficient to\nprove a pattern. But he wanted an instruction that “a\nmultiplicity of mailings or interstate communications\nmay be no indication of the requisite pattern or racketeer-\ning activity because each mailing or wire communication\nwas a separate offense and the number of offenses ‘does\nnot necessarily translate into a pattern of racketeering\nactivity.’ ” We reject his argument. In this case there are\nyears of false representations in various mail and wire\ncommunications. We have upheld convictions in similar\ncircumstances. In United States v. Genova, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782435\"><a href=\"/opinion/782435/united-states-v-jerome-genova-lawrence-gulotta-and-jerome-stack/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n759 (7th Cir. 2003), we said that a jury could conclude that\nthe false mailings in that case were integral to the scheme\nand that “because the scheme extended over several years,\na jury also sensibly could find a pattern of racketeering.”\n  In the final challenge to the convictions, defendants\nclaim that their conviction of insurance fraud under 18\nU.S.C. § 1033(b) cannot stand because NNIB was not\n“engaged in the business of insurance” as required by the\nstatute. NNIB, defendants say, is an insurance broker, not\nan insurance provider.\n  The statute defined the “business of insurance” as the\nwriting of insurance or reinsuring of risks “by an insurer,\nincluding all acts necessary or incidental to such writing\nor reinsuring and the activities of persons who act as, or\nare, officers, directors, agents, or employees of insurers or\nwho are other persons authorized to act on behalf of such\npersons[.]” § 1033(f)(1). “Insurer” means “any entity the\nbusiness activity of which is the writing of insurance or\nthe reinsuring of risks . . . .” § 1033(f)(2). We have previ-\nously said that under Illinois law, an insurance broker, or\nagent of the insured is:\n    [o]ne who procures insurance and acts as middleman\n    between the insured and the insurer, and solicits\n    insurance business from the public under no employ-\n\f14                                   Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\n     ment from any special company, but, having secured\n     an order, places the insurance with the company\n     selected by the insured, or, in the absence of any\n     selection by him, with the company selected by such\n     broker.\nAmerican Ins.

Whether the broker is an agent of the insured or\nthe insurer is a question of fact and “[a]lthough an insur-\nance broker typically represents the insured, the broker\nmay also become the agent of the insurer or both parties.”\nCapitol Indemnity Corp. v.

The evidence in this case is suf-\nficient to support a finding that the defendants were\nengaged in the business of insurance as that term is\nbroadly defined in the statute to include “all acts neces-\nsary to incidental to such writing or reinsuring.”\n§ 1033(f)(1).\n  We now turn to issues involving the forfeiture and\nrestitution orders. Restitution was ordered against both\nSegal and NNIB in the amount of $841,527.96. They\ncontend the evidence did not support $542,2911 of that\namount. The latter amount was attributable to cred-\nits—due to customers—which were written off. Of that\namount, $357,079 was alleged to be owed but not paid to\nWaste Management. Segal presented an affidavit from\nWaste Management’s risk management director saying\nthat the sum was not owed to his company. But given\nother evidence, it was certainly possible that Waste\nManagement didn’t know it had credits coming.\n\n\n1\n  The uncontested amount is the restitution ordered to be paid\nto the CTA for the illegal commission on the Blue Line project.\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   15\n\n  We review the district court’s calculation of restitution\nfor abuse of discretion.

The government is required to prove\nthe entitlement to restitution by a preponderance of the\nevidence. In this case, the credits occurred in 1999, and the\nfindings regarding the victims and the amounts they\nwere owed were based on a report prepared by a govern-\nment auditor and attached to the government’s objec-\ntions to the presentence report. NNIB CFO McNichols\ntestified about a meeting with Segal in the fall of that year\nin which old, unclaimed credits were reviewed. Segal gave\ninstructions to write them off. Another witness testified\nthat if a client did not ask for the credit for a period of\ntime, it was written off. Including these unpaid credits in\nthe restitution order cannot be said to have been errone-\nous.\n  On the forfeiture issues, an initial matter involves\nSegal’s claim that he was prejudiced by his absence from\nthe hearing at which a preliminary forfeiture order was\nentered.

Segal’s counsel was at the hearing and no\ntestimony was taken. When addressing this issue at a\nlater proceeding, District Judge Castillo stated:\n       I have taken a close look at that particular issue,\n     and I’ve read the pleadings. The record I think is\n     reflected in the pleadings that have been filed very\n     ably and adequately by Mr. Segal’s counsel that\n     reflects that the preliminary forfeiture order was\n     entered without him being here. That was an over-\n     sight. As I said at the point in time when the prelimi-\n     nary forfeiture order was entered, if we had all had\n     our thinking caps on, that order should have been\n     entered at the point in time immediately following the\n     return of the verdict, but there was a lot of issues\n     going on, not the least of which was whether or not\n     Mr. Segal would be detained pending sentencing or\n     not.\n       That being the case, the record will reflect that\n     during the entire period from the point in time that\n     preliminary forfeiture order was entered until Mr.\n     Segal’s attorneys filed their written objection, I think\n     a period of 30 days, no issue was ever brought before\n     this Court by way of any—not even one- or two-para-\n     graph motion saying Mr. Segal should have been\n     present at the preliminary forfeiture proceeding. It\n     was never brought. And that the record will reflect.\n       The record will also reflect that it’s this Court’s\n     conclusion that Mr. Segal has been more than ade-\n     quately represented during that period of time and\n     that extensive objections have been filed to the pre-\n     liminary forfeiture proceeding.\nSo Judge Castillo concluded that if there was an error, it\ndid not prejudice Segal. We agree with that conclusion.\nFurthermore, there were almost countless hearings\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                    17\n\nregarding the forfeiture in this case, hearings at which\nSegal was present unless he voluntarily chose not to\nattend, as was the case on December 29, 2004. All in all,\nwe are not convinced that Segal’s due process rights were\nviolated when the preliminary forfeiture was entered.\n  Segal also raises issues regarding the forfeitures them-\nselves. 18 U.S.C. § 1963(a) provides that a person con-\nvicted of a RICO violation shall forfeit the enterprise\n“which the person has established, operated, controlled,\nconducted, or participated in the conduct of, in violation of\nsection 1962” and “any property constituting, or derived\nfrom, any proceeds which the person obtained, directly\nor indirectly, from racketeering activity or unlawful debt\ncollection . . . .” The judgment against Segal required the\nforfeiture of both.\n   As to the enterprise, Segal contends that it was error\nfor the court to set aside the jury verdict. The contention\nrequires some explanation. The “enterprise” in this case\nwas NNIB and related affiliates. Segal was the sole owner\nof the enterprise. The judge instructed the jury that\nSegal’s interest in the enterprise was subject to forfeiture\nto the extent the enterprise was tainted by racketeering\nactivity. The verdict form asked the jury to reply “yes” or\n“no” to the question whether Segal held an interest in the\nenterprise and, if so, what percentage of Segal’s inter-\nests were tainted. The jury replied “yes” and answered\nthe latter question 60 percent. However, the judge ordered\nforfeiture of 100 percent of the enterprise, thus the\nargument is that the “60 percent verdict” was set aside.\nThe court noted that under § 1963(a), Segal’s interest in\nthe enterprise subjected 100 percent of the enterprise to\nforfeiture. That is a correct conclusion. The error was in\nsubmitting the percentage question to the jury in the\nfirst place. The error, however, had no bearing on the case.\nThe fact is that the jury found that Segal had an interest\nin the enterprise. In fact, Segal owned the enterprise. The\n\f18                                 Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nevidence at trial to that effect was not simply sufficient,\nbut overwhelming. And § 1963 requires forfeiture of the\nenterprise.\n  Segal also objects to the forfeiture of $30 million in\nproceeds. He argues that there is a fatal variance between\nthe allegations of the indictment and the theory of forfei-\nture employed at his trial. He also contends that the\nevidence is insufficient to support the amount of the\nforfeiture.\n  The indictment charges that Segal’s interest subject to\nforfeiture is\n     at least $20,000,000, including but not limited to all\n     salary, bonuses, dividends, pension and profit sharing\n     benefits received by defendant MICHAEL SEGAL,\n     from NNIB and NNNG acquired and maintained\n     during the period 1990 through 2001.\nHe says that the indictment must be interpreted to mean\nthat only his executive salary of $120,000 per year, the\ncash he took from petty cash, and the claims for personal\nexpenses are subject to forfeiture. In addition, he says the\ngovernment must show what proportion of his executive\ncompensation consisted of racketeering proceeds. We\ncannot agree.\n  The items Segal mentions are, indeed, subject to forfei-\nture, but so is some of the money he stole from the PFTA.\nThere is no requirement that proceeds be in the form of\nmore-or-less legitimate salary payments or shady small\nreimbursements. While the indictment mentions salaries,\nbonuses, etc., it also says the forfeiture includes but is\nnot limited to those items and that “at least” $20,000,000\nis subject to forfeiture. In short, the indictment does not\nlimit the forfeiture to the specific items it mentions or\nthe ones Segal acknowledges. Assets forfeited as pro-\nceeds in Genova, a case on which Segal places considerable\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                    19\n\nreliance, included clearly illegal bribes, as well as seem-\ningly legitimate attorney fees. In fact, the defendant in\nGenova conceded that the bribes he received were subject\nto forfeiture. Here, the evidence is sufficient to show that\nmoney was stolen from the PFTA. It is also sufficient to\nshow what the amount was. The evidence shows a deficit\nwhich grew over the years. At the end of 1989 the PFTA\nwas over $7 million out of trust. At the end of 1995 it was\n$10 million short. Dennis Pogenburg of the Hales Groups\ntestified that in the fall of 2001 the deficit was $24\nmillion—after $10 million in borrowed money had been\ndeposited into the fund. McNichol testified that at the\nend of April 2001 the PFTA deficit was $29 million. By\nthe end of 2001, $30 million was borrowed to meet NNIB’s\npremium obligations.\n  Segal makes much of the fact that our cases require that\nproceeds forfeitures be of net, not gross, proceeds and that\nwhile restitution is loss based, forfeiture is gain based. He\nis correct about the legal principles, as Genova and United\nStates v. Masters, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555450\"><a href=\"/opinion/555450/united-states-v-alan-masters-michael-j-corbitt-and-james-d-keating/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1991), make\nclear, but wrong about the application to his case. Here,\nthe amount stolen is equal to the amount of the deficit.\nThe gain is equal to the loss.\n  Furthermore, the $30 million is net, not gross, proceeds\nto Segal. It is true that to collect the funds which went\n(briefly) into the PFTA, NNIB had expenses—employee\nsalaries, etc. But taking the money once it was there did\nnot cause Segal to incur expenses. He does not say, for\ninstance, that he paid someone to help him make off with\nthe funds. The expenses involved in the acquisition of the\n$30 million were borne by NNIB; the defendant from\nwhom the forfeiture is sought is Segal. To him, it was\nall net proceeds, figuratively, all gravy.\n Again, Genova may provide a loose analogy. Jerome\nGenova was the mayor of Calumet City, Illinois. He\n\f20                                  Nos. 05-4601 & 05-4756\n\nappointed Lawrence Gulotta as city prosecutor and\narranged for Gulotta’s law firm to get most of the city’s\nlegal business. Gulotta kicked back to Genova about 30\npercent of the payments the law firm received from the\ncity. The kickbacks were a cost of doing business and,\nbecause we require forfeiture on net proceeds, were\ndeducted from Gulotta’s forfeiture of his fees. However, the\nkickbacks were net proceeds to Genova. In Segal’s case,\nas well, the pilfered funds were net proceeds to him—if\nnot to NNIB.\n  Segal also argues, though, that he paid the money back,\nand apparently for that reason he thinks the $30 million\nis not subject to forfeiture. We have trouble seeing why\npaying the money back means that he did not take it in\nthe first place. More importantly, he did not personally\npay it back. He paid it back by borrowing from Firemen’s\nInsurance and AIG in loans, primarily secured by assets\nof the company.\n  All of that said, what is not clear from the record is how\nmuch of the $30 million was poured back into the enter-\nprise and how much went to benefit Segal personally.\nWithout that information we cannot determine whether\nat least part of the $30 million forfeiture would con-\nstitute double billing, given that the amount that went\nback into the company will be forfeited through the\nforfeiture of the enterprise. Double billing, as the Court of\nAppeals for the Third Circuit has said, cannot be the\nintent of Congress:\n     We do not believe that Congress intended forfeiture\n     verdicts to double if property forfeitable under section\n     1963(a)(1) also happened to be forfeitable under\n     section 1963(a)(2). To read the statute to permit such\n     verdict doubling would introduce an arbitrariness\n     into the statute that could not have been contemplated\n     by Congress.\n\fNos. 05-4601 & 05-4756                                   21\n\nUnited States v. Ofchinick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528406\"><a href=\"/opinion/528406/the-united-states-v-daniel-r-ofchinick-sr-daniel-r-ofchinick-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1182 (3rd Cir.\n1989). Accordingly, we will remand the case to the district\ncourt for a determination of what portion of the $30 million\nwas not reinvested in the enterprise, but rather went to\nbenefit Segal personally and is subject to forfeiture as\nproceeds of the illegal enterprise.\n  Finally, Segal argues that the forfeiture violates the\nExcessive Fines Clause of the Constitution. We review\nconstitutional questions de novo. United States v.\nKirschenbaum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758074\"><a href=\"/opinion/758074/united-states-v-joseph-a-kirschenbaum-aka-ari-kirschenbaum-appeal-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1998).\n  In United States v. Bajakajian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 334 (1998),\nthe Court held that “a punitive forfeiture violates the\nExcessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to\nthe gravity of a defendant’s offense.” It is true that the\nforfeiture is large. It is only excessive, however, if it is\ndisproportional to the offense. We cannot say that it was.\nThis was a massive fraud. When a defendant commits a\nmultimillion-dollar crime, he can be required to forfeit\nassets also running into the millions.\n  For all these reasons, the judgment of forfeiture of the\nproceeds of the racketeering activity is VACATED and\nREMANDED for further proceedings in the district court.\nIn all other respects, the judgments against Segal and\nNNIB are AFFIRMED.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                       ________________________________\n                       Clerk of the United States Court of\n                         Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—8-2-07\n\f</pre>",
