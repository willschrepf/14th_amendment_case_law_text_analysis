(1976), for injuries resulting from an assault upon him by another inmate.  Although this is a close case, one in which we might reach a different result if we were sitting as a trial court, we nevertheless affirm the district court's judgment for the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Tony Cowart, convicted of distributing a controlled substance, was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI), a medium-security, youthful-offender institution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in Tallahassee, Florida.  At 6:30 a. m. on October 19, 1974, Cowart was stabbed in the heart while he slept, presumably with a knife from the FCI dining hall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His alleged assailant was Ronald McHarris, Jr., another inmate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a result of this attack, Cowart suffered brain damage, cortical blindness, and other injuries that rendered him substantially and permanently incapacitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attack occurred in the north wing of C-Dormitory, which housed approximately 160 inmates in two wings of 80 prisoners each.  Each wing was divided into cubicles by low walls approximately three to four feet high.  These walls partially obscured the view into the cubicles, which could be entered at will by other inmates.  As was customary during the night shift (midnight to 8:00 a. m.), there was only one officer on duty in C-Dormitory at the time when the assault occurred.  His desk was located in the lobby area between the two wings of the dormitory, not in the center of the lobby but against the wall.  From his desk, the officer's view into C-North was apparently obstructed by a small office used by correctional counsellors.  At the time of the incident, the correctional officer was seated at his desk, conversing with an inmate and making several telephone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although he did not see or hear the assault, the correctional officer went immediately to Cowart's aid when notified of the assault.  The officer on duty had worked in other FCI buildings but had never previously been assigned to C-Dormitory nor had he received any information concerning McHarris before the assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assailant, McHarris, was serving a twelve-year sentence for kidnapping.  He had a lengthy criminal history, including incidents of larceny, burglary, possession of narcotics, assault, and disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Although apparently no psychological evaluation of McHarris was made at the time he was incarcerated on his kidnapping offense, his presentence report contained a summary of a psychiatric evaluation conducted in 1969 at an Alto, Georgia, reformatory, where McHarris was then incarcerated.  The psychiatrist diagnosed McHarris as a latent schizophrenic who was quite seriously disturbed and \"likely (to) continue delinquent behavior unless there was psychiatric or psychological intervention.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McHarris had been transferred to FCI after he was involved in an early-morning dorm fight<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> at the El Reno, Oklahoma, federal reformatory, which housed youthful offenders.  On his transfer to FCI, McHarris was classified as a \"close-custody\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> inmate, a status held by approximately ten percent of the inmates at FCI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eighteen months elapsed between McHarris' transfer and the assault on Tony Cowart.  During that time McHarris was the subject of two incident reports, which were included in his file, and he was mentioned in a third, which was not so included.  The first incident report on McHarris concerned a fight between McHarris and another prisoner in the A-North dormitory at 9:45 a. m. on June 21, 1974.  The investigator who prepared the report concluded that \"McHarris was apparently trying Ellison for sex, but Ellison did (not) want (any) part of it.\"  He further commented that \"McHarris has been complained about by several inmates that he walks around (his) dorm . . .  and 'pats' weak inmates on the rear end after the lights go out.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  McHarris' second incident report concerned his possession of contraband (a $10 bill) on July 6, 1974.  In addition to these two reports, McHarris figured in an incident report filed on Raleigh T. Taylor for assaulting another prisoner at noon on April 4, 1974.  Although Taylor alone perpetrated the assault, the correctional counsellor who filed the report noted that \"Taylor &amp; 37770-115 McHarris approached him (the victim) &amp; stated they wanted sex.\"  Finally, a notation dated January 23, 1974, in McHarris' health record indicated that \"McHarris has been tentatively identified as the resident who has been pressuring white inmates in the dorm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A treatment team<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> reviewed McHarris' record on July 10, 1974.  It noted McHarris' \"unusual sexual advances to other inmates\" and expressed concern for \"his and others' protection.\"  The treatment team recommended that McHarris see Marguarite Gilbert, a psychology trainee/psychological intern<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> who had been at FCI for only five days.  After interviewing McHarris, Ms. Gilbert characterized him as \"bored\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and recommended \"beefing up\" his program to provide him with more intellectual stimulation.  Apparently because she felt that McHarris did not pose an imminent danger,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Ms. Gilbert did not recommend that McHarris see a psychiatrist, that he be transferred to another dormitory or institution, or that he receive any other form of treatment.  The assault on Cowart occurred approximately three months after McHarris' interview with Ms. Gilbert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Cowart raised numerous allegations of negligence on the part of the government or its agents and contended that these acts caused his injuries: (1) failure to give more supervision to McHarris, a close-custody inmate, than to inmates in minimum and medium custody; (2) inadequate psychiatric evaluation and treatment of McHarris in view of his prior history; (3) inadequate supervision on the night of the assault; (4) the transfer of McHarris to FCI; (5) the assignment of McHarris to a cubicled dormitory; (6) improper construction of C-Dormitory; (7) overcrowding of FCI; and (8) failure to prevent the filching of knives from the dining hall.  Testimony focused on the first three allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not make specific findings with respect to each theory of negligence alleged by Cowart.  Instead, the court found that McHarris, although known as a night roamer and homosexual, \"had caused no serious problems\" and had a character \"no worse than the general run of prison inmates.\"  Accordingly, it found that McHarris' criminal conduct was an independent, intervening cause of Cowart's injuries not foreseeable in the exercise of ordinary care.  Thus, it concluded that Cowart's injuries were not proximately caused by the government's negligence.  Because we are unable to overturn the court's findings that the conduct of the government was not negligent in any respect, we affirm its judgment for the government without reaching the issue of proximate cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTCA, the government's liability to a claimant is determined \"in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b) (1976).  Thus, in the instant case, Florida law applies.  There are four elements necessary to establish a cause of action in Florida based on negligence: (1) a duty requiring the actor to conform to a certain standard of conduct for the protection of others against unreasonable risk; (2) a failure on his part to conform to that standard; (3) a reasonable causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.  Simon v. Tampa Electric Co., 202 So.2d 209, 213 (Fla.App.1967), citing Prosser, Law of Torts 146 (3d ed. 1964).  See also Angell v. F. Avanzini Lumber Co., 363 So.2d 571, 572 (Fla.App.1978).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Muniz, 374 U.S. 150, 83 S.Ct. 1850, 10 L.Ed.2d 805 (1963), the Supreme Court held that \"the duty of care owed by the Bureau of Prisons to federal prisoners is fixed by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4042,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> independent of an inconsistent state rule.\"  Id. at 164-65, 83 S.Ct. at 1859 (footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  This duty requires \"the exercise of ordinary diligence to keep prisoners safe and free from harm.\"  Jones v. United States, 534 F.2d 53, 54 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 978, 97 S.Ct. 487, 50 L.Ed.2d 586 (1976).  Some antisocial behavior is to be expected in a prison environment; accordingly, the government is not an insurer of the safety of a prisoner.  Id.; Fleishour v. United States, 244 F.Supp. 762, 766 (N.D.Ill.1965), aff'd, 365 F.2d 126 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 987, 87 S.Ct. 597, 17 L.Ed.2d 448 (1966).  The government's liability ultimately depends upon whether the risks it took were reasonable or unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the concept of foreseeability is ordinarily associated with the issue of proximate cause, it is also bound up with the nature of the duty that an actor owes to others.  As noted above, an actor has a duty to protect others against \"unreasonable risk.\"  Simon, 202 So.2d at 213 (emphasis added).  As Prosser notes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>The idea of risk necessarily involves a recognizable danger, based upon some knowledge of the existing facts and some reasonable belief that harm may follow.  A risk is a danger which is apparent or should be apparent to one in the position of the actor.  The culpability of the actor's conduct must be judged in light of the possibilities apparent to him at the time, and not by looking backward \"with the wisdom born of the event.\"  The standard must be one of conduct, rather than of consequences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prosser, Law of Torts 146 (4th ed. 1971) (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Using Prosser's formulation, we must thus determine whether McHarris' assault on Cowart was a danger that was apparent or should have been apparent to prison officials on the basis of the information then available to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The crux of Cowart's suit was that the government had a duty to supervise McHarris more closely than other inmates or segregate him from the prison population because they knew or should have known that he presented an unreasonable risk to other inmates, far greater than the risk posed by a \"typical\" prisoner at FCI.  To buttress this contention, Cowart pointed particularly to McHarris' criminal history, his series of incident reports at El Reno and FCI, prison officials' awareness of McHarris' homosexual activity and night roaming, the psychiatric evaluation in McHarris' presentence report, and McHarris' status as a close-custody inmate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  In addition, Cowart stressed that while most of the inmates at FCI were youth offenders serving sentences of from two to five years, McHarris had received a twelve-year adult sentence.  Finally, Cowart presented testimony of a psychiatrist that, on the basis of the information available to prison officials, the government's handling of McHarris, whom he characterized as a \"very difficult person,\" was \"very inadequate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nevertheless found that McHarris had caused no serious problems and had no worse a character than that of other inmates.  In reviewing these findings of fact, we are bound by a clearly erroneous standard.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).  Because we are not left \"with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\" United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948), we conclude that the findings are not clearly erroneous.  The government presented a number of witnesses who testified that McHarris was no worse a threat to the safety of other inmates than many of the prisoners at FCI.  Gerald Farcas, Warden at FCI, testified that on the basis of McHarris' records, he did not see McHarris \"as a threat to the institution population in comparison with other cases that we get.\"  Correctional Counsellor Richard Routt testified that McHarris was not a violent or problem inmate, that he was not an assaultive individual, and that his prior criminal history, as recorded in his presentence report, \"would be no different than 50% or more of the people we get.\"  Testimony offered by Hubert Ricks, former chief correctional supervisor at FCI, indicated that in his experience three incident reports during a period of 18 months were not unusual, particularly where, as here, the incidents were \"not that serious.\"  Ricks' view was corroborated by George Wilson, a correctional treatment specialist at FCI, who testified that incidents of the sort in which McHarris was involved were \"normal, everyday happenings within a correctional institution, usually a spur-of-the-moment-type thing where inmates release tension.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  While recognizing that all of the individuals who testified for the government on this issue were affiliated in some way with FCI, we defer to the credibility choices made by the district court.  In light of this and other testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> we cannot say that the factual findings of the district court were clearly erroneous.  Thus, we conclude that because McHarris was \"no worse than the general run of prison inmates,\" the government had no duty to accord him more supervision than other prisoners or segregate him from the prison population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cowart seeks to bring the facts of this case within the ambit of Cohen v. United States, 252 F.Supp. 679 (N.D.Ga.1966), rev'd on other grounds, 389 F.2d 689 (5th Cir. 1967).  In Cohen the assailant, McDonald, had a lengthy history of psychiatric treatment predating his incarceration.  After several incidents in prison, one involving a knife attack on another inmate, McDonald received a complete psychiatric evaluation.  At that time he was specifically classified as paranoid with \"considerable likelihood of his having recurrent psychotic episodes in the future under situations of stress.\"  Id. at 683.  Later, after using strong-arm tactics on another inmate, he was placed in administrative segregation.  Nevertheless, he was permitted to go to an exercise yard, from which he escaped and assaulted Cohen.  The district court concluded that the government was negligent in granting an assaultive individual with \"a psychiatric record such as the one revealed here,\" id. at 698 (emphasis added), the freedoms available to other prisoners and allowed Cohen to recover for his injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bring the instant facts within Cohen, Cowart points to the psychiatric evaluation in McHarris' presentence report that characterized him as a latent schizophrenic who was \"likely (to) continue delinquent behavior\" unless he received psychiatric help.  See n. 6 and accompanying text, supra.  In addition, he relies on the government's knowledge of rumors cited in McHarris' health report and the various incident reports, that McHarris was a homosexual and a night roamer.  Finally, he emphasizes the treatment team's concern for the safety of McHarris and others in light of his sexual advances to other prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After closely examining the record in this case, we do not feel it is controlled by Cohen.  McHarris had never been diagnosed as psychotic or actively insane, as had the assailant in Cohen, 252 F.Supp. at 683.  Although the psychological evaluation included in his presentence report noted that McHarris was likely to continue \"delinquent behavior\" (emphasis added) without psychiatric intervention, the term \"delinquent\" implies undesirable, perhaps criminal, but not necessarily assaultive or life-threatening behavior.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  In contrast, the assailant in Cohen was diagnosed as likely to have \"recurrent psychotic episodes in the future.\"  Id. at 683 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the assailant in Cohen had been detained in administrative segregation at the time the assault occurred.  The court in Cohen stressed that not all prisoners with assaultive records must be locked in a cell, id. at 689; however, it concluded that having made the decision to place the assailant in maximum segregation, \"the government was bound to take the necessary steps to enforce that decision.\"  Id.  The court made the narrowness of its holding clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Had a fellow prisoner not in segregation and within the normal emotional range of prisoners committed the assault on Cohen in the dining hall or the Radio-TV shop or elsewhere, there would be no hesitancy in finding for the government.  But here, the government failed to provide protection when it had already decided protection was necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  (emphasis added).  Judged by these standards, Cowart cannot bring the facts of this case within the Cohen holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cowart also contends that the government was negligent in providing inadequate psychiatric evaluation and treatment of McHarris in view of his prior history, particularly in light of the treatment team's concern for McHarris' safety and the safety of others.  There was testimony going both ways.  Both Dr. Fox and Dr. Stewart Ginsberg, a psychiatrist, testified that the government should have had a psychiatric evaluation of McHarris.  Dr. Ginsberg testified that he \"was amazed at the fact that there was never any request for a psychiatric evaluation.\"  Furthermore, he testified that the psychological treatment that McHarris received at FCI was wholly inadequate.  Dr. Martin Bone, chief of the psychology department at FCI, testified, however, that the staff at FCI had been responsive to McHarris' psychological needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The treatment team had referred McHarris to the available psychologist trainee, who recommended a change in McHarris' program rather than another course.  In her deposition, Ms. Gilbert admitted that she had only been at FCI five days \"and therefore, had no forms (sic) on which to make\" a conclusive judgment that McHarris posed a noticeably different threat than other inmates.  This was an unfortunate circumstance, but we cannot say that it was sufficient to establish government negligence.  Although she may not have had sufficient experience at FCI to determine the relative threat posed by McHarris, Ms. Gilbert was apparently qualified as a psychological intern to assess whether McHarris posed any danger to the prison community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Cowart does not contend otherwise.  In her professional judgment, Ms. Gilbert concluded that McHarris did not pose a threat to the other prisoners or to the institution.  The fact that hindsight proves her wrong does not render the government negligent for referring McHarris to her or for failing to refer him to a psychiatrist.  Given these facts and the testimony of Dr. Bone, we cannot say that prison officials breached a duty to Cowart by failing to have McHarris evaluated by a psychiatrist.

James Etheridge, a unit manager at FCI, testified that the results of a study he had prepared concerning inter alia, manpower utilization and staffing problems indicated that many fewer incidents took place during the night shift than at any other time of day.  Cowart adduced testimony from the former chief correctional supervisor at FCI that he had requested additional staffing for the shift while he was still in charge.  On cross-examination, the government sought to establish that this request was relatively low priority.  In light of the conflicting testimony we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the supervision provided by the government on the night of the assault was negligent</p>\n        <p>We find Cowart's other contentions of negligence to be without merit.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(1976), for injuries resulting from an assault upon him by another inmate.

At 6:30 a. m. on October 19, 1974, Cowart was stabbed in the heart while he slept, presumably with a knife from the FCI dining hall.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  His alleged assailant was Ronald McHarris, Jr., another inmate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  As a result of this attack, Cowart suffered brain damage, cortical blindness, and other injuries that rendered him substantially and permanently incapacitated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The attack occurred in the north wing of C-Dormitory, which housed approximately 160 inmates in two wings of 80 prisoners each.  Each wing was divided into cubicles by low walls approximately three to four feet high.  These walls partially obscured the view into the cubicles, which could be entered at will by other inmates.  As was customary during the night shift (midnight to 8:00 a. m.), there was only one officer on duty in C-Dormitory at the time when the assault occurred.  His desk was located in the lobby area between the two wings of the dormitory, not in the center of the lobby but against the wall.  From his desk, the officer's view into C-North was apparently obstructed by a small office used by correctional counsellors.  At the time of the incident, the correctional officer was seated at his desk, conversing with an inmate and making several telephone calls.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Although he did not see or hear the assault, the correctional officer went immediately to Cowart's aid when notified of the assault.  The officer on duty had worked in other FCI buildings but had never previously been assigned to C-Dormitory nor had he received any information concerning McHarris before the assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The assailant, McHarris, was serving a twelve-year sentence for kidnapping.  He had a lengthy criminal history, including incidents of larceny, burglary, possession of narcotics, assault, and disorderly conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Although apparently no psychological evaluation of McHarris was made at the time he was incarcerated on his kidnapping offense, his presentence report contained a summary of a psychiatric evaluation conducted in 1969 at an Alto, Georgia, reformatory, where McHarris was then incarcerated.  The psychiatrist diagnosed McHarris as a latent schizophrenic who was quite seriously disturbed and \"likely (to) continue delinquent behavior unless there was psychiatric or psychological intervention.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McHarris had been transferred to FCI after he was involved in an early-morning dorm fight<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> at the El Reno, Oklahoma, federal reformatory, which housed youthful offenders.  On his transfer to FCI, McHarris was classified as a \"close-custody\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> inmate, a status held by approximately ten percent of the inmates at FCI.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eighteen months elapsed between McHarris' transfer and the assault on Tony Cowart.  During that time McHarris was the subject of two incident reports, which were included in his file, and he was mentioned in a third, which was not so included.  The first incident report on McHarris concerned a fight between McHarris and another prisoner in the A-North dormitory at 9:45 a. m. on June 21, 1974.  The investigator who prepared the report concluded that \"McHarris was apparently trying Ellison for sex, but Ellison did (not) want (any) part of it.\"  He further commented that \"McHarris has been complained about by several inmates that he walks around (his) dorm . . .  and 'pats' weak inmates on the rear end after the lights go out.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  McHarris' second incident report concerned his possession of contraband (a $10 bill) on July 6, 1974.  In addition to these two reports, McHarris figured in an incident report filed on Raleigh T. Taylor for assaulting another prisoner at noon on April 4, 1974.  Although Taylor alone perpetrated the assault, the correctional counsellor who filed the report noted that \"Taylor &amp; 37770-115 McHarris approached him (the victim) &amp; stated they wanted sex.\"  Finally, a notation dated January 23, 1974, in McHarris' health record indicated that \"McHarris has been tentatively identified as the resident who has been pressuring white inmates in the dorm.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A treatment team<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> reviewed McHarris' record on July 10, 1974.  It noted McHarris' \"unusual sexual advances to other inmates\" and expressed concern for \"his and others' protection.\"  The treatment team recommended that McHarris see Marguarite Gilbert, a psychology trainee/psychological intern<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> who had been at FCI for only five days.  After interviewing McHarris, Ms. Gilbert characterized him as \"bored\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> and recommended \"beefing up\" his program to provide him with more intellectual stimulation.  Apparently because she felt that McHarris did not pose an imminent danger,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Ms. Gilbert did not recommend that McHarris see a psychiatrist, that he be transferred to another dormitory or institution, or that he receive any other form of treatment.  The assault on Cowart occurred approximately three months after McHarris' interview with Ms. Gilbert.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial Cowart raised numerous allegations of negligence on the part of the government or its agents and contended that these acts caused his injuries: (1) failure to give more supervision to McHarris, a close-custody inmate, than to inmates in minimum and medium custody; (2) inadequate psychiatric evaluation and treatment of McHarris in view of his prior history; (3) inadequate supervision on the night of the assault; (4) the transfer of McHarris to FCI; (5) the assignment of McHarris to a cubicled dormitory; (6) improper construction of C-Dormitory; (7) overcrowding of FCI; and (8) failure to prevent the filching of knives from the dining hall.  Testimony focused on the first three allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not make specific findings with respect to each theory of negligence alleged by Cowart.  Instead, the court found that McHarris, although known as a night roamer and homosexual, \"had caused no serious problems\" and had a character \"no worse than the general run of prison inmates.\"  Accordingly, it found that McHarris' criminal conduct was an independent, intervening cause of Cowart's injuries not foreseeable in the exercise of ordinary care.  Thus, it concluded that Cowart's injuries were not proximately caused by the government's negligence.  Because we are unable to overturn the court's findings that the conduct of the government was not negligent in any respect, we affirm its judgment for the government without reaching the issue of proximate cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTCA, the government's liability to a claimant is determined \"in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(b) (1976).  Thus, in the instant case, Florida law applies.  There are four elements necessary to establish a cause of action in Florida based on negligence: (1) a duty requiring the actor to conform to a certain standard of conduct for the protection of others against unreasonable risk; (2) a failure on his part to conform to that standard; (3) a reasonable causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.

To buttress this contention, Cowart pointed particularly to McHarris' criminal history, his series of incident reports at El Reno and FCI, prison officials' awareness of McHarris' homosexual activity and night roaming, the psychiatric evaluation in McHarris' presentence report, and McHarris' status as a close-custody inmate.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  In addition, Cowart stressed that while most of the inmates at FCI were youth offenders serving sentences of from two to five years, McHarris had received a twelve-year adult sentence.  Finally, Cowart presented testimony of a psychiatrist that, on the basis of the information available to prison officials, the government's handling of McHarris, whom he characterized as a \"very difficult person,\" was \"very inadequate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court nevertheless found that McHarris had caused no serious problems and had no worse a character than that of other inmates.

The government presented a number of witnesses who testified that McHarris was no worse a threat to the safety of other inmates than many of the prisoners at FCI.  Gerald Farcas, Warden at FCI, testified that on the basis of McHarris' records, he did not see McHarris \"as a threat to the institution population in comparison with other cases that we get.\"  Correctional Counsellor Richard Routt testified that McHarris was not a violent or problem inmate, that he was not an assaultive individual, and that his prior criminal history, as recorded in his presentence report, \"would be no different than 50% or more of the people we get.\"  Testimony offered by Hubert Ricks, former chief correctional supervisor at FCI, indicated that in his experience three incident reports during a period of 18 months were not unusual, particularly where, as here, the incidents were \"not that serious.\"  Ricks' view was corroborated by George Wilson, a correctional treatment specialist at FCI, who testified that incidents of the sort in which McHarris was involved were \"normal, everyday happenings within a correctional institution, usually a spur-of-the-moment-type thing where inmates release tension.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  While recognizing that all of the individuals who testified for the government on this issue were affiliated in some way with FCI, we defer to the credibility choices made by the district court.  In light of this and other testimony,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> we cannot say that the factual findings of the district court were clearly erroneous.  Thus, we conclude that because McHarris was \"no worse than the general run of prison inmates,\" the government had no duty to accord him more supervision than other prisoners or segregate him from the prison population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cowart seeks to bring the facts of this case within the ambit of Cohen v.

In Cohen the assailant, McDonald, had a lengthy history of psychiatric treatment predating his incarceration.  After several incidents in prison, one involving a knife attack on another inmate, McDonald received a complete psychiatric evaluation.  At that time he was specifically classified as paranoid with \"considerable likelihood of his having recurrent psychotic episodes in the future under situations of stress.\"  Id. at 683.  Later, after using strong-arm tactics on another inmate, he was placed in administrative segregation.  Nevertheless, he was permitted to go to an exercise yard, from which he escaped and assaulted Cohen.  The district court concluded that the government was negligent in granting an assaultive individual with \"a psychiatric record such as the one revealed here,\" id. at 698 (emphasis added), the freedoms available to other prisoners and allowed Cohen to recover for his injuries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To bring the instant facts within Cohen, Cowart points to the psychiatric evaluation in McHarris' presentence report that characterized him as a latent schizophrenic who was \"likely (to) continue delinquent behavior\" unless he received psychiatric help.  See n. 6 and accompanying text, supra.  In addition, he relies on the government's knowledge of rumors cited in McHarris' health report and the various incident reports, that McHarris was a homosexual and a night roamer.  Finally, he emphasizes the treatment team's concern for the safety of McHarris and others in light of his sexual advances to other prisoners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After closely examining the record in this case, we do not feel it is controlled by Cohen.  McHarris had never been diagnosed as psychotic or actively insane, as had the assailant in Cohen, 252 F.Supp. at 683.  Although the psychological evaluation included in his presentence report noted that McHarris was likely to continue \"delinquent behavior\" (emphasis added) without psychiatric intervention, the term \"delinquent\" implies undesirable, perhaps criminal, but not necessarily assaultive or life-threatening behavior.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a>  In contrast, the assailant in Cohen was diagnosed as likely to have \"recurrent psychotic episodes in the future.\"  Id. at 683 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the assailant in Cohen had been detained in administrative segregation at the time the assault occurred.  The court in Cohen stressed that not all prisoners with assaultive records must be locked in a cell, id. at 689; however, it concluded that having made the decision to place the assailant in maximum segregation, \"the government was bound to take the necessary steps to enforce that decision.\"  Id.  The court made the narrowness of its holding clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Had a fellow prisoner not in segregation and within the normal emotional range of prisoners committed the assault on Cohen in the dining hall or the Radio-TV shop or elsewhere, there would be no hesitancy in finding for the government.  But here, the government failed to provide protection when it had already decided protection was necessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id.  (emphasis added).  Judged by these standards, Cowart cannot bring the facts of this case within the Cohen holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cowart also contends that the government was negligent in providing inadequate psychiatric evaluation and treatment of McHarris in view of his prior history, particularly in light of the treatment team's concern for McHarris' safety and the safety of others.  There was testimony going both ways.  Both Dr. Fox and Dr. Stewart Ginsberg, a psychiatrist, testified that the government should have had a psychiatric evaluation of McHarris.  Dr. Ginsberg testified that he \"was amazed at the fact that there was never any request for a psychiatric evaluation.\"  Furthermore, he testified that the psychological treatment that McHarris received at FCI was wholly inadequate.  Dr. Martin Bone, chief of the psychology department at FCI, testified, however, that the staff at FCI had been responsive to McHarris' psychological needs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The treatment team had referred McHarris to the available psychologist trainee, who recommended a change in McHarris' program rather than another course.  In her deposition, Ms. Gilbert admitted that she had only been at FCI five days \"and therefore, had no forms (sic) on which to make\" a conclusive judgment that McHarris posed a noticeably different threat than other inmates.  This was an unfortunate circumstance, but we cannot say that it was sufficient to establish government negligence.  Although she may not have had sufficient experience at FCI to determine the relative threat posed by McHarris, Ms. Gilbert was apparently qualified as a psychological intern to assess whether McHarris posed any danger to the prison community.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>  Cowart does not contend otherwise.  In her professional judgment, Ms. Gilbert concluded that McHarris did not pose a threat to the other prisoners or to the institution.  The fact that hindsight proves her wrong does not render the government negligent for referring McHarris to her or for failing to refer him to a psychiatrist.  Given these facts and the testimony of Dr. Bone, we cannot say that prison officials breached a duty to Cowart by failing to have McHarris evaluated by a psychiatrist.  In so holding, we by no means countenance inadequate or substandard psychological evaluation or treatment of prison inmates, nor do we dilute the government's duty to \"exercise . . .  ordinary diligence to keep prisoners safe and free from harm.\"  Jones, 534 F.2d at 54.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  We hold only that on the basis of the testimony presented at this trial, the government's evaluation and treatment of McHarris were reasonable in light of his prior history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Prisoners incarcerated in FCI are between the ages of 18 and 24</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The weapon with which Cowart was stabbed was never found</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> McHarris was never indicted for the crime, but he was found to have committed it by a prison disciplinary committee</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The calls were intended to clarify the work assignment of the prisoner to whom the correctional officer was speaking</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> McHarris' presentence report indicated that he was also a suspect in several armed robberies at the time he was convicted on his kidnapping offense.

On the other hand, the government adduced evidence supporting its contention that one guard was adequate.  James Etheridge, a unit manager at FCI, testified that the results of a study he had prepared concerning inter alia, manpower utilization and staffing problems indicated that many fewer incidents took place during the night shift than at any other time of day.  Cowart adduced testimony from the former chief correctional supervisor at FCI that he had requested additional staffing for the shift while he was still in charge.  On cross-examination, the government sought to establish that this request was relatively low priority.  In light of the conflicting testimony we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the supervision provided by the government on the night of the assault was negligent</p>\n        <p>We find Cowart's other contentions of negligence to be without merit.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
