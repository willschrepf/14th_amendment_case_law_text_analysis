The District Court granted\n\fsummary judgment in favor of the defendants on the basis that the nightmares cited by\n\nPerez at his deposition did not constitute a “prior showing of physical injury” as required\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2) and 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e) to claim mental or emotional\n\ndamages. Perez appealed, and we vacated the District Court’s judgment.\n\n       We noted that the District Court did not consider all of the physical injuries Perez\n\nclaimed:\n\n               [I]t is unclear why the District Court did not consider whether the\n       immediate physical effects from the asthma attack itself would have\n       constituted a “prior showing of physical injury” under the statute, but it did\n       not. See Munn v. Toney, 433 F.3d 1087 (8th Cir. 2006) (prisoner’s\n       allegations and testimony of headaches, cramps, nosebleeds, and dizziness\n       while prison missed prescribed blood pressure screenings sufficient to\n       overcome § 1997e bar); cf. Davis v. District of Columbia, 158 F.3d 1342,\n       1349 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (physical manifestations of emotional injury do not\n       qualify as “prior” physical injuries). In its brief, the United States asserts\n       that Perez only identified bad dreams as his injuries. While the United\n       States is correct that Perez claims only damages for mental or emotional\n       distress, it is wrong that Perez never identified other physical injuries that\n       occurred as a result of the alleged asthma attack. At the deposition, Perez\n       stated that he was dizzy, weak, nauseous, and had a headache immediately\n       after the attack, and that he had back pain from coughing for a couple of\n       days. (See Plaintiff’s Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment,\n       attached as Exhibit 1, at p. 53-54.) Just because Perez is not claiming\n       damages specifically from those physical injuries does not mean that his\n       allegations of them cannot be considered as a showing of a physical injury\n       for the purposes of the statute. See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2).\n\nPerez v. United States, 271 F. App’x 240, 242 (3d Cir. 2008). We directed the District\n\nCourt to consider on remand whether the other physical injuries Perez claimed met the\n\ncriteria of 28 U.S.C. § 1346(b)(2) and 28 U.S.C. § 1997e(e).\n\n       On remand, the District Court again found Perez unable to overcome the physical\n\n                                              2\n\finjury requirement of the statutes “because his dizziness, headaches, weakness, back pain,\n\nand nausea, all of which were temporary in nature and did not require medical attention,\n\nare considered de minimis for the purposes of the FTCA’s physical injury requirement.”\n\nDistrict Court Memorandum 5.\n\n       We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291. Our review of the District\n\nCourt’s order granting summary judgment is plenary. See Abramson v. William Paterson\n\nCollege, 260 F.3d 265, 276 (3d Cir. 2001). We apply the same standard that a district\n\ncourt must apply in deciding whether summary judgment is merited. See id. We view the\n\nfacts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all inferences in that\n\nparty’s favor to determine whether there is a genuine issue of any material fact and\n\nwhether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See id.\n\n       Applying this standard, we cannot conclude, as the District Court did, that the\n\nUnited States was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because Perez suffered only de\n\nminimis physical injuries. Ultimately, it may be true that Perez’s injuries were like the\n\n“sore, bruised ear lasting for three days” which the court in Siglar v. Hightower classed as\n\nde minimis. See 112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). Or they could be de minimis injuries\n\nlike “swelling, pain, and cramps,” Jarriett v. Wilson, 414 F.3d 634, 641 (6th Cir. 2005), or\n\n“nose sores [that] were relieved with water and baby oil,” Canell v. Multnomah County,\n\n141 F. Supp. 2d 1046, 1053 (D. Or. 2001). The injuries Perez reported might be like a\n\n“sore muscle, an aching back, a scratch, an abrasion, a bruise, etc., . . . [like those that]\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fpeople in the regular and ordinary events and activities in their daily lives do not seek\n\nmedical care for.” Luong v. Hatt, 979 F. Supp. 481, 486 (N.D. Tex. 1997).\n\n       However, Perez reported that his symptoms, associated with his asthma attack,\n\nwere of such a severity that he needed steroids, prescription medicine, and other medical\n\ntreatment to recover. Plaintiff’s Exhibits in Support of his Response to the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment, Ex. 1, Perez Dep. 43, 48, 53-55, 58. Although the District Court\n\nfound that Perez did not require medical treatment to resolve his symptoms, the issue is a\n\nmatter of contention between the parties. Furthermore, in Luong, the court distinguished\n\nthose injuries that resolve with home treatment from those injuries that require a visit to\n\nan emergency room or a doctor, assessing the former as de minimis. See 979 F. Supp. at\n\n486; see also Munn v. Toney, 433 F.3d 1087, 1089 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that\n\nallegations and testimony about headaches, cramps, nosebleeds, and dizziness related to\n\nmissing prescribed blood pressure screenings were sufficient to overcome § 1997e bar).\n\nWe note that a severe asthma attack can be life-threatening like a heart attack, which\n\ncourts have held to be more than a de minimis physical injury. See Mata v. Saiz, 427 F.3d\n\n745, 755 n.4 (10th Cir. 2005) (discussing the Mayo Clinic’s assessment of severe chest\n\npain and heart attack as life-threatening); Sealock v. Colorado, 218 F.3d 1205, 1210 n.6\n\n(10th Cir. 2000). The severity of the attack and the need for medical treatment are\n\ngenuine issues of material fact in this case. It remains in question whether Perez met the\n\nphysical injury requirement to support his negligence claim for emotional injuries.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       In addition to arguing that Perez’s injuries were de minimis, the United States\n\npresses us to affirm the District Court’s judgment because Perez did not present expert\n\ntestimony to support his claim that the failure to treat his asthma attack caused his\n\ninjuries. However, we will not take up this issue. Not only did the United States not raise\n\nthe issue in the District Court, see Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Pa. Pub. Util.\n\nComm’n, 273 F.3d 337, 344 n.3 (3d Cir. 2001), but also, in its brief in support of its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, it seemed to argue that expert testimony is not necessary\n\nto resolve this case. (Specifically, in the District Court, the United States contended that\n\nthe law “does not require expert medical testimony - in [sic] case such a [sic] this - if a\n\nmatter is so simple or obvious to be within a lay person’s range of experience and\n\ncomprehension.” Brief in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment 11\n\n(citation omitted).)\n\n       In short, because the nature of Perez’s injuries remains unclear in light of the\n\nconflicting submissions of the parties, we conclude that the District Court’s decision to\n\ngrant summary judgment in favor of the United States on the basis that Perez’s injuries\n\nwere de minimis was in error. We will vacate the District Court’s judgment. We remand\n\nthis matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f",

Tex. 1997).\n\n       However, Perez reported that his symptoms, associated with his asthma attack,\n\nwere of such a severity that he needed steroids, prescription medicine, and other medical\n\ntreatment to recover. Plaintiff’s Exhibits in Support of his Response to the Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment, Ex. 1, Perez Dep. 43, 48, 53-55, 58. Although the District Court\n\nfound that Perez did not require medical treatment to resolve his symptoms, the issue is a\n\nmatter of contention between the parties. Furthermore, in Luong, the court distinguished\n\nthose injuries that resolve with home treatment from those injuries that require a visit to\n\nan emergency room or a doctor, assessing the former as de minimis. See 979 F. Supp. at\n\n486; see also Munn v. Toney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792888\"><a href=\"/opinion/792888/willie-munn-v-rick-toney-warden-varner-unit-adc-gates-security-guard/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1089 (8th Cir. 2006) (holding that\n\nallegations and testimony about headaches, cramps, nosebleeds, and dizziness related to\n\nmissing prescribed blood pressure screenings were sufficient to overcome § 1997e bar).\n\nWe note that a severe asthma attack can be life-threatening like a heart attack, which\n\ncourts have held to be more than a de minimis physical injury. See Mata v. Saiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166569\"><a href=\"/opinion/166569/mata-v-saiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755 n.4 (10th Cir. 2005) (discussing the Mayo Clinic’s assessment of severe chest\n\npain and heart attack as life-threatening); Sealock v.

The severity of the attack and the need for medical treatment are\n\ngenuine issues of material fact in this case. It remains in question whether Perez met the\n\nphysical injury requirement to support his negligence claim for emotional injuries.\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       In addition to arguing that Perez’s injuries were de minimis, the United States\n\npresses us to affirm the District Court’s judgment because Perez did not present expert\n\ntestimony to support his claim that the failure to treat his asthma attack caused his\n\ninjuries. However, we will not take up this issue. Not only did the United States not raise\n\nthe issue in the District Court, see Bell Atlantic-Pennsylvania, Inc. v. Pa. Pub.

(Specifically, in the District Court, the United States contended that\n\nthe law “does not require expert medical testimony - in [sic] case such a [sic] this - if a\n\nmatter is so simple or obvious to be within a lay person’s range of experience and\n\ncomprehension.” Brief in Support of Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment 11\n\n(citation omitted).)\n\n       In short, because the nature of Perez’s injuries remains unclear in light of the\n\nconflicting submissions of the parties, we conclude that the District Court’s decision to\n\ngrant summary judgment in favor of the United States on the basis that Perez’s injuries\n\nwere de minimis was in error. We will vacate the District Court’s judgment. We remand\n\nthis matter to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f</pre>",
