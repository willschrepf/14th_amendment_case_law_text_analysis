With her on the \nbrief were Linda Sher, Associate General Counsel, John D. \nBurgoyne, Acting Deputy Associate General Counsel, and \nFred L. Cornnell, Supervisory Attorney.\n\n     Before:  Wald, Silberman and Sentelle, Circuit Judges.\n\n     Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge Wald.\n\n     Wald, Circuit Judge:  In June 1996, the Service Employees \nInternational Union Local 790, AFL-CIO (\"Union\") began a \ncampaign to unionize a daycare site operated by Family \nService Agency San Francisco (\"FSA\"), a private agency \nhired by state and local authorities to provide child care to \nunderprivileged children.  The Union set about organizing \nthe supervising teachers, who were in charge of six class-\nrooms at the site, as well as the assistant teachers, teachers' \naides, and the facility's office and support workers.  In Octo-\nber 1996, the Union filed a petition with the National Labor \nRelations Board (\"NLRB\" or \"Board\") seeking a representa-\ntion election among these employees.  FSA objected to the \nproposed bargaining unit on the ground that supervising \nteachers were statutory supervisors and so disqualified under \nthe National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\" or \"the Act\") \nfrom inclusion.  After a hearing, the Board's Regional Di-\nrector found that they were not supervisors and ordered an \nelection in the petitioned-for unit.  On appeal, the Board \namended this ruling to permit the supervising teachers to \nvote subject to challenge.  See Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") at 42 \n(Order of Dec. 19, 1996).\n\n     The election was held on January 8, 1997.  The union won \n25 to 12, with one challenged ballot.  At the pre-election \nconference, FSA did not challenge the ballots cast by super-\nvising teachers.  After the election, it filed the following \nobjections:  (1) the Union destroyed the laboratory conditions \nof the election by improperly appealing to racial prejudice \nduring the election campaign;  (2) the election was tainted by \nthe involvement of supervisory teachers in the election pro-\ncess;  (3) Union supporters engaged in improper electioneer-\ning during the voting;  (4) the Union engaged in misconduct \n\n\n\nwhen its agents improperly invaded the workplace;  and (5) \nthe election was invalid because the Union failed to file \nreports required by the Labor-Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act (\"LMRDA\"), 29 U.S.C. ss 431(a), 431(b), 432 \n& 435.1  The Board's hearing officer, after four days of \ntestimony, issued a report which recommended that all of the \nobjections be overruled.  FSA filed exceptions with the \nBoard, but the Board rejected them and instead adopted the \nhearing officer's findings and conclusions.  The Decision and \nCertificate of Representative issued on October 17, 1997.  \nFSA refused to bargain with the Union on the ground--the \nsame raised in its objections--that the election was not \nconducted lawfully.  J.A. at 107 (Answer to Complaint).  The \nUnion filed a complaint with the Board, charging that FSA \nviolated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Rela-\ntions Act (\"NLRA\" or \"the Act\"), 29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(1) and \n(5), and the NLRB General Counsel subsequently brought an \nunfair labor practice charge against the agency.  The Board \ngranted the NLRB's motion for summary judgment, and FSA \nasks that we deny enforcement of the Board's order to \nbargain collectively.2  The NLRB cross-petitions for enforce-\nment.\n\n     We hold that FSA is estopped from attempting to litigate \nthe question whether the election was tainted by the involve-\nment of supervisors.  FSA waived its right to a ruling on \nwhether the supervising teachers are statutory supervisors \n\n__________\n     1 FSA also objected that the Union improperly threatened em-\nployees, made promises of monetary reward and made misrepresen-\ntations during the campaign.  The Board's rejection of these objec-\ntions was not raised here.\n\n     2 Certification by the Board is not an \"order\" subject to judicial \nreview, see American Fed'n of Labor v. NLRB, 308 U.S. 401 (1940), \nso review of certification proceedings must await a final order by \nthe Board in an unfair labor practice proceeding (often called a \n\"technical refusal to bargain\") under sections 10(e) and (f) of the \nNLRA, as amended, 29 U.S.C. ss 160(e) and (f).  The record of the \ncertification proceeding becomes part of the record for review in the \nunfair labor practice case pursuant to section 9(d), 29 U.S.C. \ns 159(d).\n\n\n\nduring the prior representation proceeding, and may not \nbring that issue before this court.  We also find that the \nBoard reasonably concluded that FSA's other objections \nlacked merit.\n\n                                I. Background\n\n\n     Teachers and administrators work in close proximity at \nFSA's Bryant Street site, serving 160 children aged two \nweeks to three years old.  Each classroom is staffed by a \nsupervising teacher, an assistant teacher, and teachers' aides.  \nWhen the Union began its organizing campaign in June 1996, \nracial discord already characterized relations between Afri-\ncan-American and Latina3 employees.  The supervisor of the \ncenter, Vivian Storey, who is African-American, testified that \nat some point before the Union's arrival, a Latina co-worker \ntold Storey that she could not socialize with her African-\nAmerican co-workers anymore because she had been ha-\nrassed by another Latina.  J.A. at 510.  In addition, the \nemployees took racially segregated lunch periods, with Latina \nworkers eating from 12:30 to 1:30 and African-Americans \nfrom 1:30 to 2:30 p.m.  J.A. at 552.\n\nThe Language Issue\n\n     The pivotal issue that drove a wedge between Latina and \nAfrican-American workers--the alleged presence of a policy \nlimiting use of Spanish in the classroom and front office--\nsurfaced well before the unionization campaign.  In early \n1996, there were a series of meetings among administrators \nin which the staff addressed, among other things, complaints \nabout Sandra Ramirez, who worked in the center's front \noffice and dealt with agency clients.  J.A. at 751-58 (testimo-\nny of Claudette Darley, operations manager).  At one such \nmeeting, according to Darley, one of Ramirez' supervisors, \nRamirez was instructed to speak English whenever she was \nin a group of people that included non-Spanish speakers.  \n\n__________\n     3 We use the term \"Latina\" to refer to employees whose first \nlanguage is Spanish because the Spanish-speaking employees at \nissue in this case are all women.\n\n\n\nJ.A. at 767.  Ramirez was told of an incident in which three \nAfrican-American parents were standing in the office while \nthe Latina staff conversed in Spanish, and Ramirez was \nwarned that this could be considered insulting by non-\nSpanish-speaking parents.  Id.;  see also J.A. at 797 (notes \nfrom 1/11/96 staff meeting).\n\n     The language issue arose again on June 5, 1996, when a \nstaff meeting was held among the teachers in Room 2.  \nAmong the teachers who attended were Phyllis Hogan, the \nAfrican-American supervising teacher for the room;  Edith \nRuiz, a Latina teachers' aide;  and Johnny Overton, an Afri-\ncan-American substitute teachers' aide.  According to testi-\nmony and contemporaneous hand-written notes from the \nmeeting (it is not clear from the record who served as note-\ntaker) a parent had complained about the Latina staff's \nspeaking Spanish to her son.  The notes from the meeting set \nforth the following:  \"It is appropriate to speak Spanish to \nchildren whose primary language is Spanish, as long as it is \nin accordance with their parents' wishes.  It is appropriate to \nspeak Spanish to Spanish-speaking parents in order to convey \ninformation or explain things more clearly.\"  J.A. at 796 \n(emphasis in original).  \"If a non-Spanish-speaking parent or \nstaff member is nearby when Spanish is being spoken, a staff \nmember will attempt to give a short explanation in English of \nwhat is being discussed so they don't feel unwelcome or \nuncomfortable;  Ex:  'Hi ___.  I was just explaining this \nmemo to ___.  I'll be right with you.' \"  Id.\n\n     Some time later in June, according to Ruiz, Ruiz was \nspeaking Spanish to a parent and Hogan came into the room.  \nHogan \"touched me on the shoulder and she told me, 'Re-\nmember.'  And then she told me ... that we were going to \nhave a short meeting,\" Ruiz testified.  J.A. at 706.  Once the \nchildren went down for their naps, Hogan asked Ruiz wheth-\ner she remembered that she should not speak Spanish, ac-\ncording to Ruiz, and Ruiz asked for a written policy regarding \nthe language issue.  J.A. at 706-07.  This was followed by a \ntense interaction between Storey, who subsequently inter-\nvened, and Ruiz;  Ruiz testified that Storey told her she was \nin America and should speak English, J.A. at 706, but Storey \n\n\n\f\ndenied this and recalled that she told Ruiz each employee \nneeded to be sensitive to other cultures, J.A. at 527.  \"My \nwords was to her that there is a whole lot of rules and \nregulations that I do not like,\" Storey testified, \"and I said if \nI could not follow the rules and stuff, then it was time for me \nto leave.\"  Id.\n\n     Also at the end of June, the teachers in Room 7/9 held a \nstaff meeting at which they discussed the use of Spanish.  \nNotes from this meeting reflect mounting tension over the \nissue.  Marva Stephens, the African-American supervising \nteacher in the classroom at the time, indicated on the \"Meet-\ning Outcome\" form that \"[t]o identify speech and language \nproblems, staff will use English then Spanish to enhance \nreceptive language skills, and to assist development by speak-\ning English.\"  J.A. at 804.  But Lourdes Perez, a Latina \nteachers' aide, wrote in Spanish her own version of what \nhappened at the meeting on the \"Meeting Outcome\" form.  \nPerez testified that her notation reads:  \" 'Today, June 26, our \nsupervisor once again has forbidden us.  She does not want \nus to talk Spanish in the rooms.  And that she does not care \nwhat the Union' has said....\"  J.A. at 726.  At the hearing, \nStorey denied directing Stephens to implement an \"English-\nonly\" language policy.  J.A. at 570.\n\nThe Organizing Campaign\n\n     In their testimony Storey and other higher-ranking em-\nployees all unequivocally denied that FSA ever had an \"En-\nglish-only\" language policy, but Latina employees felt that \ntheir supervisors were increasing pressure on them to stop \nspeaking Spanish.  When the Union began to hold meetings \namong employees in the prospective bargaining unit in the \nsummer of 1996, J.A. at 512, the language issue was one of \nthe first workplace problems that the Latina employees men-\ntioned to Union organizer Ruben Garcia.  J.A. at 719 (testi-\nmony of Lourdes Perez);  J.A. at 735 (testimony of Ruben \nGarcia).  Garcia testified that he referred the employees to \nLa Raza Central Legal, a public interest law organization \nwhich specializes in Latino issues, in an effort to extricate the \n\n\n\f\nunion from the language issue because it \"in my experience [ ] \nshows to be a divisive issue.\"  J.A. at 735.  Garcia also \ntestified that the Union never distributed literature address-\ning the language issue.  J.A. at 739.  Not surprisingly, the \nunion drive was still racially divisive.  Two African-American \nemployees, Art Marshall, the cook at FSA, and Ann Douglas, \na substitute teachers' aide, testified that they initially attend-\ned some Union meetings.  As the campaign continued into \nthe fall, however, Garcia conducted the meetings primarily in \nSpanish, with English translation.  Marshall and Douglas \nthought that they were being denied a full understanding of \nwhat was said at the meetings, and Marshall, who had \napproached Garcia several times about his concerns that \nAfrican-Americans had been left out of the organizing efforts, \nfelt that the Union did not care about the concerns of \nAfrican-American workers.  Marshall said:\n\n     ... I even told him [Garcia], hey man, ... some of the \n     blacks kind of like want to bow out of this because we \n     feel like our issues aren't being met and most of the \n     Chicano issues are.\n\n          He said, well, we'll get with that, you know.... I even \n     told him how to go about bringing the blacks back into \n     the thing, but he kind of like ignored it, overlooked it \n     or--that's the way I look at it.\n\n     ....\n\n          I just said that I think we should, you know, we should \n     try to get together, you know, and keep blacks involved \n     in this, because I was still strongly for the Union and \n     then he kept saying, ... we'll deal with it, and that never \n     came.  It never happened.\n\n          ... I think the issues were for the Spanish and not me \n     as a black man.\n\nJ.A. at 639-41.  Hogan and teachers' aide Shereece Cooks, \nalso African-American, were approached at different times by \nLatino employees about the Union, but they neither received \nany Union literature nor were they asked to sign authoriza-\ntion cards.  Overton testified that she was never approached \n\n\nby a Union organizer or supporter.4  By mid-fall, Marshall \nand Douglas stopped attending Union meetings.  After the \nelection, when a Union organizer called Douglas and invited \nher to a victory party, it was, in her view, a day late and a \ndollar short;  Douglas refused to attend.  J.A. at 621-22.\n\nThe Press Event\n\n     Workplace tensions skyrocketed when, on September 20, \n1996, a television station came to Bryant Street and inter-\nviewed Latina employees about the language issue during the \n12:30 lunch hour.  According to a San Francisco Examiner \narticle that featured the same interviews, the employees \naccused the management at FSA, and Storey in particular, of \npreventing them from speaking Spanish on the job through \nharassment and intimidation.  J.A. at 773.  Assistant teacher \nReyna Ferreira was quoted as saying, \" 'Whenever [Vivian \nStorey, the site supervisor] or the other superiors hear us \nspeak Spanish, they come up and say \"English, English, \nEnglish.\" ' \"  Id.  Perez was also quoted:  \" 'Our supervisors \nlook at us like we're bad, like we're criminals because we \nspeak Spanish.' ... 'Vivian says to us, \"You are in America.  \nYou have to learn English.\" ' \"  Id.  No African-American \nemployees or managers from the Bryant Street site were \ninterviewed, although Shereece Cooks testified that she saw \nthe Latina employees ask Art Marshall if he would go on \ncamera.  J.A. at 577-78.\n\n     The identity of the organizer of this press event was \ndisputed during the hearing, and FSA argues here that the \nUnion sponsored it.  Garcia denied this and testified that he \nthought a lawyer from La Raza had contacted the media.  \nGarcia was present at the event but he did not speak on \ncamera;  witnesses saw him chatting with employees after \nthey had been interviewed.  Sandra Ramirez was under the \n\n__________\n     4 Various witnesses acknowledged, however, that Garcia visited \nthe Latina lunch hour, and not the later one attended by African-\nAmericans, because Storey and other supervisors usually ate during \nthe later period.\n\n\n\f\nimpression that the other Latina employees at FSA had \ncontacted the press.\n\n     After this publicity, African-American employees were livid \nand the racial divide widened.  \"[F]rom then on, they [Afri-\ncan-American co-workers] changed their attitude towards us \na lot and they didn't treat us the same, and ... they looked at \nus badly,\" Lourdes Perez testified.  J.A. at 491.  Ann Doug-\nlas said that the Latina employees \"stopped speaking, some of \nthem.  When I would walk [into her classroom] in the morn-\ning and say good morning, some of them would speak, some \nwouldn't, and I would go on one side of the room, on the other \nside with my kids....\"  J.A. at 618.  Marshall said that he \nfeared physical violence would erupt.  J.A. at 649.  In Octo-\nber, Cooks, Overton and Douglas all complained to Storey \nthat they felt they were being taunted by the Latina employ-\nees who continuously spoke only Spanish in their presence, an \noccurrence that became more frequent after the press inter-\nviews.\n\nThe Radio Interview\n\n     In November 1996, Garcia arranged an interview with \nhimself, Ramirez and Perez at a Spanish-language radio \nstation in San Francisco.  The three talked, in Spanish, about \nthe language policy problem at FSA.  Perez said in the \ninterview that \"Even with the parents themselves who don't \nunderstand the language, English, we're told that we have to \ntalk to them in English even though they [ ] talk to us in \nSpanish....\"  J.A. at 779.  Garcia explained that his Union \nwas trying hard to organize the public sector because \"there \nare many conditions similar to what Sandra and Lourdes are \nexpressing here.\"  J.A. at 792.  He continued, \"[W]e also \nfound that there were other workers, non-Latinos who were \nalso suffering from mistreatment and from, from low wages \nand exploitation that they were enduring.  That is we came to \nfind out that there were many more problems than about \nSpanish but the Spanish problem was one that stood out \nbecause of the magnitude of it.\"  J.A. at 793.  Ramirez and \nPerez played a tape of the interview during the lunch hour of \n\n\n\f\nthe Latina employees, although there is no evidence that any \nAfrican-American workers heard the broadcast.  Jones testi-\nfied that she heard someone utter the words, in English, \n\"black monkey,\" but she did not know whether the words \ncame from the tape or from Perez, who was in the room.  The \ntranscript from the interview does not contain those words in \nEnglish or Spanish.  J.A. at 774-95.  Soon after, at Thanks-\ngiving, the traditional school-wide potluck degenerated into \ntwo separate luncheons, one for African-Americans and one \nfor Latinas.\n\nThe Workplace Visits\n\n     During the organizing period, Garcia and another Union \norganizer, Doris Mitchell,5 occasionally came to the Bryant \nStreet premises to talk to employees, usually during the 12:30 \nlunch hour.  Storey testified that she saw Mitchell \"six or \nseven times\" on the premises, but Storey's only confrontation \nwith Mitchell occurred in August 1996, when she came across \nMitchell conversing with employees in the lunchroom.  Storey \nopened the door and closed it, and thought she heard Mitchell \nshouting and laughing at her.  This happened again, and \nStorey left.  Mitchell left shortly thereafter.  J.A. at 540-41.  \nLater, in early December, Storey had an encounter with \nGarcia, who was in the lunchroom during the 12:30 period.  \nStorey asked Garcia to leave, and he refused.  J.A. at 544. \nStorey left to go to her office to call the police, and Garcia \n\"came up to the office and he said to me he had every right \nto, in a loud manner, to be there.\"  Id.  Garcia announced \nthat he would stay until 1:30 and then depart--which he did.  \nThe police were never summoned and there were apparently \nno witnesses to the encounter in the office.  J.A. at 545.\n\nThe Vote\n\n     On January 8, 1997, the day of the election, there was a \npre-election meeting with the NLRB agent to discuss the \nrules for voting.  Witnesses agreed that the Board agent did \n\n__________\n     5 Mitchell is African-American and ran the first few Union meet-\nings in the summer of 1996, until Garcia took over.\n\n\n\nnot establish a \"no-electioneering\" zone and did not issue \nrules governing the conduct of employees during the voting \nperiod.  An FSA employee, Jaynie Lara, was appointed to \nread the voting \"script\" to the workers in each classroom and \nto escort employees from their classrooms or the office to the \nlunchroom, where votes were cast.  At one point during the \nhour and a half voting period, according to Lara, she told an \non-call cook, Arturo Martinez, to sit in a chair outside the \nlunchroom, which was off the main hallway, and wait his turn \nto vote.  For approximately 20 minutes, Martinez spoke to \nthe voters who, one-by-one, entered and exited the lunch-\nroom.  Lara estimated the number of voters whom Martinez \naddressed as 10.  Martinez told the employees in Spanish to \n\"stick together\" and \"vote for the union,\" according to Lara, \nand also asked them how they had voted.  J.A. at 434.  Lara \nalso recalled that three employees stood clustered in the door \nof Room 7/9 for about half an hour during the voting and \nmade similar comments to voters;  two employees behaved \nsimilarly in the doorway of Room 5 for about 20 minutes.  It \nappears from the record that one of these rooms is across the \nhall from the lunchroom, and the other diagonal from it.  \nAlso, after Lara had read her script to the voters in Room 7/9 \nand Room 5, the supervising teacher in each room--Ana \nHernandez and Esperanza Reveles, respectively--told the \nvoters to make sure they voted for the union.\n\n                                II. Discussion\n\n\n     We will affirm the Board's decision to order collective \nbargaining in the face of objections to the Union's representa-\ntion if the decision is reasonable and if the Board's underlying \nfindings of fact are supported by substantial evidence on the \nrecord as a whole.  See E.N. Bisso & Son v. NLRB, 84 F.3d \n1443, 1445 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  The Board must determine \nwhether the challenged conduct tended to interfere with \nemployees' free exercise of the franchise.  See Amalgamated \nClothing & Textile Workers Union v. NLRB, 736 F.2d 1559, \n1562 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  This is a fact-intensive determination \nespecially suited for Board review.  See id. (\"important in \ncounseling deference to Board decisions ... is the fact that \n\n\n\f\nthe Board's particular expertise qualifies it--rather than the \ncourts--to decide whether to call for a rerun election\").  A \nhearing officer \"is '[ ] far better situated than are we to draw \nconclusions about a matter as ephemeral as the emotional \nclimate of the [workplace] at the time of the election.' \"  E.N. \nBisso & Son, 84 F.3d at 1444 (citation omitted).  As a general \nmatter, the burden is on the party seeking to overturn a \nBoard-conducted representation election to establish that the \nelection was not fairly conducted.  See Amalgamated Cloth-\ning Workers of America v. NLRB, 424 F.2d 818, 827 (D.C. \nCir. 1970) (citing Southwestern Portland Cement Co. v. \nNLRB, 407 F.2d 131, 134 (5th Cir. 1969)).  A court will \noverturn the Board's decision to certify a bargaining unit only \nwhere the activities of union supporters created \" 'an atmo-\nsphere of fear and coercion which made a free and fair \nelection impossible.' \"  Amalgamated Clothing & Textile \nWorkers Union, 736 F.2d at 1562 (quoting Daylight Grocery \nCo. v. NLRB, 678 F.2d 905, 909 (11th Cir. 1982)).\n\n     A.Racial Appeals During Election Campaign\n\n     FSA objected after the election that \"[t]he union and its \nsupporters and agents conducted a campaign and engaged in \ntactics and conduct designed to pit Latino workers against \nAfrican-American and other non-Latino workers, thereby \nbasing their campaign on racial and ethnic prejudice and \ndiscrimination,\" and also that \"[b]y ... appeals to racial and \nethnic prejudice, the union unlawfully coerced, intimidated \nand interfered with the rights of eligible voters, and de-\nstroyed the laboratory conditions necessary for a valid elec-\ntion.\"  J.A. at 44 (letter to NLRB, January 15, 1997).  The \nhearing officer rejected this objection, we think reasonably.\n\n     We begin with the law that governs the use of race-based \nmessages in union campaigns.  The principle that the party \nchallenging the election bears the burden of proving its \ninvalidity gives way if the party that prevailed in the election \nused racial propaganda in an irrelevant and inflammatory \nmanner.  If the prevailing party inflamed racial prejudice to \ngarner pro- or anti-union support, then it must prove that its \nrace-laden statements were truthful and germane to the \n\n\n\f\nunionization effort.  The Board has articulated the perimeters \nof racially charged but permissible campaign statements and \nmessages:\n\n          ... [A] relevant campaign statement is [not] to be \n     condemned because it may have racial overtones....  \n     We would be less than realistic if we did not recognize \n     that such statements, even when moderate and truthful, \n     do in fact cater to racial prejudice.  Yet we believe that \n     they must be tolerated because they are true and be-\n     cause they pertain to a subject concerning which employ-\n     ees are entitled to have knowledge....\n\n          So long, therefore, as a party limits itself to truthfully \n     setting forth another party's position on matters of racial \n     interest and does not deliberately seek to overstress and \n     exacerbate racial feelings by irrelevant, inflammatory \n     appeals, we shall not set aside an election on this ground.  \n     However, the burden will be on the party making use of \n     a racial message to establish that it was truthful and \n     germane, and where there is doubt as to whether the \n     total conduct of such party is within the described \n     bounds, the doubt will be resolved against him.\n\nSewell Manuf. Co., 138 N.L.R.B. 66, 71-72 (1962) (footnote \nomitted) (emphasis in original).\n\n     Applying Sewell, we look first to whether the Union delib-\nerately drove a wedge between African-American and Latina \nco-workers by racial baiting--namely, by assailing the cen-\nter's alleged language policy in a way that was inflammatory \nand irrelevant to the campaign and by failing to ensure the \ninclusion of African-Americans during the membership drive.6  \n\n__________\n     6 The parties do not dispute that the Union's alleged targeting of \nmembers based on race should be considered under the Sewell \nanalysis.  We note and adopt the Fifth Circuit's view on this issue:\n\n     That the Union's appeal in this case was predominately to [one \n     race] does not in itself tell us either that race was the theme of \n     the campaign, or that the Union's appeal was inflammatory.  \n     Rather, we think the racial one-sidedness of the Union's effort \n     should be given the analytical effect in our review of intensify-\n\n\nOur sister circuits have approached this task by examining \nthe tenor and relevance of the union's race-based message as \nwell as the degree to which the message formed the \"core\" of \nthe unionization drive.  See, e.g., M & M Supermarkets, Inc. \nv. NLRB, 818 F.2d 1567 (11th Cir. 1987);  NLRB v. Utell \nInt'l, Inc., 750 F.2d 177 (2d Cir. 1984);  NLRB v. Silverman's \nMen's Wear, Inc., 656 F.2d 53 (3d Cir. 1981);  Peerless of \nAmerica, Inc. v. NLRB, 576 F.2d 119 (7th Cir. 1978);  NLRB \nv. Bancroft Manuf. Co., 516 F.2d 436 (5th Cir. 1975).  The \nmore outrageous and inflammatory the statement, the less \nimportant the question whether it formed the \"core\" of the \ncampaign, and the more difficult it becomes for its sponsor to \nprove its relevance and truth.  For example, in Silverman's \nMen's Wear, the Third Circuit held that the NLRB erred in \nnot holding a hearing based on evidence proffered by the \nemployer that a union official called a company official a \n\"stingy Jew\" in front of 20 employees shortly before the \nelection.  656 F.2d at 57-58.  Although the statement stood \nalone and did not comprise a core campaign issue, the court \nfound it to be so inflammatory that the \"Union clearly could \nnot have met\" its burden of proving it was actually relevant.  \nId. at 58;  see also M & M Supermarkets, 818 F.2d at 1573-74 \n(one employee's reference to employers as \"those damned \nJews\" at a single meeting enough to invalidate election);  cf. \nUtell Int'l, 750 F.2d at 179 (\"the Sewell test for truth and \nrelevancy ... is applicable only to inflammatory racial ap-\npeals\").7\n\n__________\n     ing the scrutiny with which we regard the incidents of the \n     Union's \"appeal to race hatred\" cited by the Company.\n\nNLRB v. Sumter Plywood Corp., 535 F.2d 917, 926 (5th Cir. \n1976) (footnote omitted).\n\n     7 The Fifth Circuit appears to have adopted the approach that if a \nracial message forms either the core of the campaign or is inflam-\nmatory, the burden shifts to the sponsor to prove that the state-\nment was truthful and relevant to the campaign.  See Sumter \nPlywood, supra note 6, at 925 (\"the reversal of burden of persua-\nsion occurs if the racial remarks 'form the core or theme of the \ncampaign,' or if the statements are racially inflammatory\") (citation \nomitted);  Bancroft Manuf., 516 F.2d at 442-43.  Instead, we adopt \n\n\n     It is permissible for a union to promulgate a message that \nis wholly relevant and accurate, even though it implicates \nrace.  A \"union's claim that management discriminated on the \nbasis of race, sex and national origin [is] not an inflammatory \nracial appeal.\"  State Bank of India, 808 F.2d at 542;  cf. \nUtell Int'l, 750 F.2d at 178-79.  The hearing officer in this \ncase reasonably concluded that the Union's and employees' \nstatements and actions regarding the language issue amount-\ned to no more than a claim of discrimination.  Lourdes Perez' \nnotation on the June 26 meeting form that Latina employees \nhad been forbidden from speaking Spanish, the subsequent \nskirmishes over language issues between Latina employees \nand their supervisors, Latina employees' complaints to the \nnews media that their supervisors harangued them to speak \nEnglish, and the similar comments made during the radio \ninterview do not appear to be empty claims aimed at provok-\ning racial hatred.  We reach this conclusion without deciding \nwhether these acts were attributable to the Union.  See \nNLRB v. Herbert Halperin Distributing Corp, 826 F.2d 287, \n291 (4th Cir. 1987) (question is whether the \"amount of \nassociation between the union and the [employees] is signifi-\ncant enough to justify charging the union with the conduct\") \n(quotation omitted).  By so doing, we subject the Union to a \nstandard more stringent than that other courts have required \nwhen examining the actions of third parties:  Where the \nUnion sponsored the race-based message, the election must \nbe set aside if the message was inflammatory and inspired an \natmosphere of fear and coercion.  Cf. id. at 290 (election set \naside because of third-party conduct only if election was held \nin \"a general atmosphere of confusion, violence, and threats of \nviolence...\") (citation omitted).  Even assuming arguendo \nthat the Union was responsible for the turmoil over the \nalleged existence of a language policy, we are unable to \n\n__________\nthe Second and Seventh Circuits' sliding scale approach, in which \nwe assess together the degree of the message's relevance and \nimportance.  See Utell Int'l, 750 F.2d at 179;  State Bank of India v. \nNLRB, 808 F.2d 526, 541 (7th Cir. 1986).  Otherwise, the promul-\ngation of a \"core\" yet tempered and relevant race-based message \nwould unnecessarily require further and redundant examination.\n\n\n\f\nidentify any statements or actions it made that were so \ninflammatory and irrelevant that the Board's contrary conclu-\nsion must be overturned.  The comments reported in the San \nFrancisco Examiner article and the statements made in the \nradio interview appear to us, as to the Board, to be reason-\nably accurate descriptions of the situation as Garcia and the \nLatina employees perceived it to be and not calculated to \nspark racial prejudice.8  Written records--namely, from the \nJune 5 staff meeting in Room 2--and the testimony of Vivian \nStorey as to her encounters with Latina employees may tend \nto support FSA's contention that there was no official \"En-\nglish-only\" policy.  However, the hearing officer found that \nemployees' testimony to the contrary was credible, and it is \nnot necessary to determine whether there actually existed an \nestablished English-only policy;  the relevant point is that the \nBoard could reasonably find, in this conflicted record, that the \nLatina employees' allegations that one existed were not reck-\nless, capricious, or otherwise emblematic of an intent to \ninvoke racial hatred. The subsequent conflict over the use of \nSpanish in the presence of non-Spanish speaking employees, \nthe complaints by African-American workers about feeling \nexcluded among Spanish speakers, and the racial bifurcation \nof the Thanksgiving dinner illustrate the racial tension at \n\n__________\n     8 FSA asserts that Garcia made inflammatory misrepresentations \nto the Latina employees by telling them that they had an \"absolute \nright\" to speak Spanish on the job.  Petitioner's (Pet.) Br. at 23.  \nGarcia himself said he told the employees that he thought the \npolicy, if it existed, was \"illegal or [wrong],\" and Perez testified that \nGarcia told her that she had a \"right\" to speak Spanish.  J.A. at \n737-38;  719-20.  FSA argues that this statement was wrong in \nlight of Garcia v. Spun Steak, 998 F.2d 1480 (9th Cir. 1993) (holding \nthat, in the circumstances presented in that case, an English-only \npolicy in the workplace could not constitute a violation of Title VII), \nbut this legal conclusion, alone, is not sufficient to render Garcia's \nstatements prejudicial enough to invalidate the election.  See Utell, \n750 F.2d at 179-80 (in case of alleged misrepresentation, Board is to \nconsider, inter alia, other party's opportunity to correct the misrep-\nresentations before invalidating election).\n\n\n\f\nFSA but do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the \nUnion was igniting prejudice.  The hearing officer did not \ncredit Jones' testimony that the words \"black monkey\" were \nactually uttered, J.A. at 67, and there is no reason in the \nrecord for us to disturb this finding.  See E.N. Bisso & Son, \n84 F.3d at 1444-45 (hearing officer is \"uniquely well-placed to \ndraw conclusions about credibility\") (citation and quotation \nomitted).\n\n     We stress that we do not endorse what appears from most \naccounts to have been a palpable disinterest by the Union in \nnon-Latino workers and the resulting de facto segregation of \nemployees during the organizing drive.  See Sumter Ply-\nwood, 535 F.2d at 926 (\"This concentration on voters of one \nrace, to the relative exclusion of voters of the other, is \ndisturbing and is not to be condoned\").  Yet even considering \nthis lamentable behavior towards African-American workers, \nwe nonetheless agree with the Board that there was nothing \nin this tendentious campaign that made \"impossible a sober, \ninformed exercise of the franchise.\"  Sewell Manuf., 138 \nN.L.R.B. at 71.\n\n     B.Supervisory Taint in the Election Process\n\n     FSA objected that the \"petition and election process were \nunlawfully tainted by the inclusion of statutory supervisors,\" \nJ.A. at 44.  The threshold question in a supervisory taint \nclaim is, of course, whether the accused parties were in fact \n\"supervisors\" under the NLRA.  See Westwood One Broad-\ncasting Servs., Inc., 323 N.L.R.B. 1002 (1997), enforced 159 \nF.3d 1352 (3d Cir. 1998).  This issue could have been litigated \nat FSA's behest during the representation stage of these \nproceedings.  In fact, FSA initially challenged the presence of \nsupervising teachers in the bargaining unit. See 29 U.S.C. \ns 152(3) (excluding from its definition of covered \"employee \n... any individual employed as a supervisor\").  After a \nhearing on the matter, the Regional Director found that the \nsupervising teachers were not statutory supervisors under \nthe NLRA, but on appeal the Board amended the Regional \nDirector's decision to permit the teachers to vote subject to \nchallenge.  See J.A. at 101 n.3 (Decision and Certification of \n\n\n\f\nRepresentative, October 17, 1997).  At the pre-election con-\nference, the Employer's representative explicitly withdrew \nthe challenge to the eligibility of the supervising teachers.  \nSee id.\n\n     In issuing its Certificate of Representative, the Board \ndenied FSA's post-election objection based on supervisory \ntaint because it was \"in the nature of postelection challenges \nwhich the Board has held that it will not entertain.\"  J.A. at \n101.  The Board has long refused to hear challenges to votes \nbrought for the first time after an election, as well as objec-\ntions that are merely reformulated challenges to votes.  See, \ne.g., NLRB v. A.J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. 324, 332 (1946);  Prior \nAviation Serv., Inc., 220 N.L.R.B. 460, 461 n.3 (1975) (listing \ncases).  The difference between objections and challenges is \nthat \"[o]bjections relate to the working of the election mecha-\nnism and to the process of counting the ballots accurately and \nfairly.  Challenges, on the other hand, concern the eligibility \nof prospective voters.\"  A.J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. at 334.  The \nban on post-election challenges is traditionally employed \nwhen one party files a post-election \"objection\" that directly \nchallenges the eligibility of a voter that was not raised \npreviously.  See Prior Aviation Serv., Inc., supra, at 460 (ban \non post-election challenges applied to objection that alleged \nemployee \"was an ineligible voter by reason of his superviso-\nry status\").  Otherwise, as the Supreme Court has observed, \nlosing parties would be able to lodge attacks on elections ad \ninfinitum, \"delay[ing] the finality and statutory effect of the \nelection results.\"  A.J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. at 332.\n\n     The Board in this case not unreasonably relied on the ban \non post-election challenges to bar FSA's attempt to revisit the \nissue of the teachers' supervisory status after the election, \nsince FSA had explicitly abandoned that same challenge \nbefore the election.  But it is not clear that the ban will take \nit the whole way, because, as noted above, it has traditionally \nbeen limited to challenges to votes or the constituency of the \nbargaining unit.  However, the Board does allude briefly to a \ncollateral estoppel argument which we find more compelling, \nthat is, that a party such as FSA here cannot specifically \nwithdraw its challenge to certain voters as supervisors and \n\n\n\f\nlater allege that they are indeed supervisors whose partic-\nipation in the disputed election has \"tainted\" it.  See J.A. at \n101 n.3.\n\n     Thus, since FSA withdrew its challenge to the supervisory \nstatus of the teachers pre-election, it was subsequently es-\ntopped from litigating the issue post-election, and as the \nBoard found in its Decision and Order in the instant section \n8(a)(5) refusal-to-bargain proceeding, see J.A. at 135, cannot \nnow reopen the record of the representation proceeding to \nattempt again to litigate this issue.  Board rules bar reopen-\ning the record to litigate issues in related unfair labor prac-\ntice proceedings that the Board could have reviewed in the \nrepresentation proceeding.  See 29 C.F.R. s 102.67(f).9  And \nFSA \"fail[ed] to request review\" of whether a supervising \nteacher is a statutory supervisor prior to the election, thereby \nprecluding it from \"relitigating, in any related subsequent \nunfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or \ncould have been, raised in the representation proceeding.\"  \nId.  We have, it is true, previously held that a union is not \nbarred under this rule from relitigating representation issues \nwhen it brings unfair labor practice charges under sections \n8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3)10 of the NLRA because such charges do not \n\n__________\n     9 Section 102.67(f) states:  \"The parties may, at any time, waive \ntheir right to request review.  Failure to request review shall \npreclude such parties from relitigating, in any related subsequent \nunfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or could have \nbeen, raised in the representation proceeding.  Denial of a request \nfor review shall constitute an affirmance of the regional director's \naction which shall also preclude relitigating any such issues in any \nrelated subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding.\"\n\n     10 These sections provide, in relevant part:\n\n     (a) Unfair labor practices by employer\n\n     It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer--\n\n     (1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the \n     exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;\n\n     ...\n\n\nconstitute a \"related subsequent unfair labor practice pro-\nceeding\" (emphasis added).  See Thomas-Davis Med. Ctrs. v. \nNLRB, 157 F.3d 909, 913 (D.C. Cir. 1998);  Clark & Wilkins \nIndus., Inc. v. NLRB, 887 F.2d 308, 316 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  \nSimilarly, an employer in a subsequent section 8(a)(1) or \n8(a)(3) proceeding is not barred from raising a defense that \nwas or could have been litigated in the representation pro-\nceeding.  See Intermountain Rural Elec. Ass'n v. NLRB, 732 \nF.2d 754, 760-61 (10th Cir. 1984)) (permitting confidential \nemployee defense).  By contrast, a section 8(a)(5) case based \non an employer's technical refusal to bargain in order to \nobtain review of the representation proceeding is necessarily \na \"related subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding.\"  See \nAmalgamated Clothing Workers of America, AFL-CIO v. \nNLRB, 365 F.2d 898, 903 (D.C. Cir. 1966) (a company's \nappeal to the court in a refusal to bargain proceeding must be \n\"based on the record made at the earlier representation \nhearing\");  see also NLRB v. Hydro Conduit Corp., 813 F.2d \n1002, 1005 (9th Cir. 1987);  Intermountain Rural Elec., 732 \nF.2d at 760-61;  Rock Hill Tel. Co. v. NLRB, 605 F.2d 139, \n143 (4th Cir. 1979);  Heights Funeral Home, Inc. v. NLRB, \n385 F.2d 879, 881-82 (5th Cir. 1967).  Accord Hyatt Hotels, \nInc., 256 N.L.R.B. 1099 (1981) (in refusal to bargain proceed-\ning, no relitigation of supervisory status of pro-union employ-\nee who was alleged by employer to have interfered with the \nelection).  Since the record shows that FSA waived its right \nto request review of the supervisory status of the supervising \nteachers during the representation proceeding, relitigation of \nthe supervisory taint issue is precluded.\n\n     C.Unlawful Electioneering\n\n     Another of FSA's objections was that \"Union supporters \nand agents engaged in unlawful electioneering, coercion, in-\ntimidation and interference in the vicinity of the polling place \nduring the election.\"  J.A. at 45.  We believe that the Board \n\n__________\n     (3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment \n     or any term or condition of employment to encourage or \n     discourage membership in any labor organization....\n\n29 U.S.C. s 158(a).\n\n\nreasonably concluded that the electioneering at Bryant Street \non the day of the election was within the permissible range.\n\n     The Board has repeatedly declined to impose a zero-\ntolerance rule on voting day electioneering.  See Overnite \nTransp. Co. v. NLRB, 140 F.3d 259, 269 (D.C. Cir. 1998) \n(citing Boston Insulated Wire & Cable Co., 259 N.L.R.B. \n1118, 1118 (1982), enforced, 703 F.2d 876 (5th Cir. 1983));  see \nalso NLRB v. Duriron Co., 978 F.2d 254, 256 (6th Cir. 1992) \n(\" 'Laboratory conditions' are not always achieved in practice, \nand elections are not automatically voided whenever they fall \nshort of perfection.\").  \"Instead, the Board considers a range \nof factors and circumstances in determining whether election-\neering activity is sufficient to justify overturning an election.\"  \nOvernite Transp., 140 F.3d at 269.  The Board has considera-\nble discretion to determine whether the circumstances of an \nelection have enabled employees to exercise free choice in \ncasting their ballots.  Id.  When \"prolonged conversations \nbetween representatives of any party to the election and \nvoters waiting to cast ballots\" take place, Milchem, Inc., 170 \nN.L.R.B. 362, 362 (1968), the Board will order a new election.  \nCf. NLRB v. Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc., 823 F.2d 1135 (7th Cir. \n1987) (Milchem does not require new election when union \nrepresentative spoke with employees lined up on sidewalk \nbefore polls open).\n\n     But where, as here, the electioneering did not involve union \nagents, the Board will overturn the election \"only if the \nelectioneering 'substantially impaired the exercise of free \nchoice.' \"  Overnite Transp., 140 F.3d at 270 (citing Del Rey \nTortilleria, 823 F.3d at 1140 (citation omitted)).\n\n     The Board generally considers the nature and extent of \n     the electioneering, whether it happened within a desig-\n     nated \"no electioneering\" area, whether it was contrary \n     to the instructions of the Board's election agent, whether \n     a party to the election objected to it, and whether a party \n     to the election engaged in it.\n\nId. at 270.  In this case, the Board agent did not designate a \n\"no-electioneering zone\" outside of the lunchroom.  FSA \nurges us to consider Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Petersburg, \n\n\n\f\nInc., 291 N.L.R.B. 578 (1988), in which the Board found that \nunlawful electioneering had occurred within a prima facie \n\"no-electioneering\" zone even though none had been estab-\nlished before the election.  In Pepsi-Cola Bottling, however, \nthe Board determined that this \"no electioneering\" zone \nexisted where employees waited in line to vote.  By contrast, \nas the Board correctly found in the instant case, employees \ndid not wait outside the lunchroom to vote.  There was thus \nno area where employees stood as a captive audience, waiting \nto cast their ballots, that should have been considered off-\nlimits as a matter of law.  Applying the other factors, the \nemployees did not act contrary to any of the instructions of a \nBoard agent, see Star Expansion Indus. Corp., 170 N.L.R.B. \n364 (1968) (agent of union asked to leave no-electioneering \nzone three times).  Nor does FSA contend that it objected to \nthe activities of the Union's supporters at the time employees \nentered or exited the voting place.\n\n     Finally, the general \"nature and extent\" of the electioneer-\ning in this case did not substantially impair employees' ability \nto exercise free will at the ballot box.  The Board reasonably \nfound that the combined effect of the relatively brief inter-\nludes of electioneering by teachers as voters exited and \nentered classrooms 5 and 7/9, as well as Martinez' occasional \ncomments as he sat outside the lunchroom waiting to vote, \nwas not coercive.  Compare Claussen Baking Co., 134 \nN.L.R.B. 111 (1961) (prolonged antiunion discussion between \na leadman and several new employees within 15 feet of the \npoll in no-electioneering zone, with a plant manager standing \nnearby, and which was stopped only by intervention of the \nBoard agent, required that election be set aside), with Duri-\nron, 978 F.2d at 258 (no new election where pro-union em-\nployees gathered in hallways for an hour during voting period \nwithin 15 to 20 feet of polling place and discussed pro-union \nposition with employees in their work areas);  Boston Insulat-\ned Wire & Cable Sys. v. NLRB, 703 F.2d at 880-81 (no new \nelection where union agents leafletted outside doors as em-\nployees entered building and proceeded down corridor to \nvote);  and Southeastern Mills, Inc., 227 N.L.R.B. 57 (1976) \n(no new election where pro-union employee sat for 20 minutes \n\n\n\f\nnear employees waiting in line to vote, loudly predicted their \nvotes and stated that he hoped they had voted right).  That \nthe classrooms were located just across the hall from the \nvoting area is acknowledgedly troubling, because it allowed at \nleast some voters to be subjected to pro-union campaigning \nup to the last moments before they cast their ballots.  Simi-\nlarly, the Union supporters' inquiries to voters leaving the \npolling place as to how they cast their ballots is not paradig-\nmatic of sterile \"laboratory conditions.\"  However, ultimately, \nwe defer to the Board's reasoned conclusion that neither of \nthese occurrences tend to intimidate voters in light of the fact \nthat employees were not standing in line to vote as a captive \naudience to the union supporters' comments, there was no \"no \nelectioneering\" zone, and further, that no evidence was ad-\nduced that voters were forced to contend with a constant \nbarrage, as opposed to an intermittent sprinkling, of pro-\nunion advocacy.\n\n     D.Union Agents' Invasion of the Workplace\n\n     FSA also alleged that \"Union agents repeatedly invaded \nthe employer's workplace during working times to engage in \nelectioneering with employees, deliberately creating hostile \nconfrontations with management and refusing to leave when \nlawfully asked to do [sic].\"  J.A. at 45.  This objection must \nalso fail.  When a party to an election is alleged to have \nengaged in conduct requiring the overturning of the election \nresults, the Board, and we, employ a standard similar to the \none used with allegations of improper electioneering.  \"[T]he \nBoard judges the conduct by assessing whether it 'reasonably \ntend[ed] to interfere with the employees' free and uncoerced \nchoice in the election.' \" NLRB v. Earle Industries, Inc., 999 \nF.2d 1268, 1272 (8th Cir. 1993) (quoting Baja's Place, Inc., \n268 N.L.R.B. 868, 868 (1984)).  The factors the Board consid-\ners include:  the number of incidents of misconduct;  the \nseverity of the incidents and whether they were likely to \ncause fear among the employees in the bargaining unit;  and \nthe proximity of the misconduct to the election date.  See id.;  \nsee also Avis Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 280 N.L.R.B. 580 (1986).\n\n\n\f\n     Here, as the Board correctly found, Mitchell and Garcia \nmade several visits to the Bryant Street site but only two \nalleged \"incidents\" of misconduct occurred.  Site Supervisor \nStorey's brief run-in with Mitchell could hardly be described \nas likely to induce fear among employees;  it was not confron-\ntational and there is no evidence that Mitchell was even asked \nto leave.  Although there were witnesses to Storey's initial \nencounter with Garcia, that encounter consisted only of Gar-\ncia's telling Mitchell that he had a right to be on the premis-\nes.  The evidence does not reflect that there were any \nwitnesses to the subsequent, slightly more rancorous encoun-\nter in the office.  Even so, whatever employee angst may \nhave resulted from these two encounters surely dissipated by \nelection day--one incident occurred five months and the other \none month before the election. Cf. Wilkinson Mfg. Co. v. \nNLRB, 456 F.2d 298, 303-04 (8th Cir. 1972) (two month \ninterval before election not enough if the incident had been a \nconstant topic of discussion and concern);  Station Operators, \n307 N.L.R.B. 263 (1992) (fact that incident occurred two \nweeks before election supported finding that pre-election \nmisconduct did not taint election).  This case is thus distin-\nguishable from Phillips Chrysler Plymouth, Inc., 304 \nN.L.R.B. 16 (1991), where union agents engaged in a shouting \nmatch with the company's president in front of all 10 mem-\nbers of the bargaining unit an hour before the polls opened \nand refused to leave even after the company called the police.  \nThese two run-ins did not rise to the level of interfering with \nemployees' free and uncoerced choice in the election.\n\n     E.Compliance with the LMRDA Reporting Requirement\n\n     Finally, FSA objected that the Union is not a bona fide \nlabor organization under the NLRA for purposes of repre-\nsenting employees because it \"unlawfully failed and refused to \nfile any of the financial and other reports required of all \nprivate sector unions.\"  J.A. at 44.  FSA asserted that \"the \nunion's refusal to file was a violation of employees' Section 7 \nrights to know about union finances and other matters in \norder to make an informed election choice....\"  Id.  The \nLMRDA requires labor unions to file certain financial disclo-\nsure reports.  See 29 U.S.C. ss 431(a), 431(b), 432 & 435;  see \n\n\n\f\ngenerally Brennan v. Local Union 10, 527 F.2d 588 (9th Cir. \n1975).  Section 2(5) of the NLRA, which makes no reference \nto these reporting requirements, merely defines a \"labor \norganization\" as including \"any organization of any kind ... \nin which employees participate and which exists for the \npurpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers \nconcerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, \nhours of employment, or conditions of work.\"  29 U.S.C. \ns 152(5).  In the course of pre-election proceedings in the \ninstant case, the Regional Director concluded that compliance \nwith the LMRDA was not relevant to the union's status as a \nlabor organization under the NLRA.  See J.A. at 21-22.  The \nhearing officer, and the Board in turn, adopted this conclu-\nsion.  Desert Palace, Inc., 194 N.L.R.B. 818, 818 n.5 (1972) \n(\"The NLRB is not entrusted with the administration of the \n[LMRDA].  An organization's possible failure to comply with \nthat statute should be litigated in the appropriate forum \nunder that act, and not by the indirect and potential duplica-\ntive means of our consideration....\");  see also S.H. Kress & \nCo., 212 N.L.R.B. 132 (1974).  In a case in which a company \nargued that a labor union should not be entitled to an order \ndirecting an election because of, inter alia, numerous internal \nproblems and possible mob influence, the Board concluded:\n\n          The allegations made by [the company] ... concern \n     improper or corrupt practices in the administration of \n     internal union affairs.  In ... the [LMRDA], Congress \n     expressly dealt with such matters.  It is particularly signifi-\n     cant that the remedies provided in the LMRDA were given \n     to individual employees directly, and to the public through \n     the intervention of [other departments].  The theory un-\n     derlying this type of remedial legislation is not to \"illegal-\n     ize\" the organization itself, but to afford protection to all \n     parties concerned by creating specific Federal rights and \n     remedies whereby the activities of the organization and its \n     officers and agents are regulated and subjected to judicial \n     review in vindication of those rights.  Had Congress de-\n     sired to strike directly at the organization itself, Congress \n     would have said so.\n\n\n\f\nAlto Plastics Manuf. Corp., 136 N.L.R.B. 850, 853 (1962).  In \noral argument, FSA attempted to distinguish Alto Plastics \nfrom this case because the company in Alto Plastics had \nsought directly to invoke the Board's jurisdiction to hear a \ncomplaint brought under the LMRDA, whereas here, FSA is \nnot asking the Board to adjudicate the LMRDA issue.  How-\never, this analysis ignores the basic point of Alto Glass, which \nis applicable here:  the LMRDA is simply \"not relevant or \nmaterial to the issue of [the Union's] status as a labor \norganization,\" at least in the circumstances of this case.  Id. \nat 851.11\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we deny FSA's petition for \nreview and grant the Board's petition for enforcement of its \nDecision and Order.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n__________\n     11 In oral argument and in the Reply brief, counsel for FSA \ncontended that the company's argument is not premised on compli-\nance with the NLRA's definition of a \"labor organization,\" but \nrather on the theory that a violation of employees' section 7 rights \nunder the NLRA is itself a form of election-related misconduct.  \nHowever, FSA has failed to point to any evidence in the record that \nwould show the alleged section 7 violation \"reasonably tend[ed] to \ninterfere with the employees' free and uncoerced choice in the \nelection.\"  Baja's Place, 268 N.L.R.B. at 868.  We therefore reject \nthis theory as well.\n\n                                               \n",

The Union set about organizing \nthe supervising teachers, who were in charge of six class-\nrooms at the site, as well as the assistant teachers, teachers' \naides, and the facility's office and support workers.  In Octo-\nber 1996, the Union filed a petition with the National Labor \nRelations Board (\"NLRB\" or \"Board\") seeking a representa-\ntion election among these employees.  FSA objected to the \nproposed bargaining unit on the ground that supervising \nteachers were statutory supervisors and so disqualified under \nthe National Labor Relations Act (\"NLRA\" or \"the Act\") \nfrom inclusion.  After a hearing, the Board's Regional Di-\nrector found that they were not supervisors and ordered an \nelection in the petitioned-for unit.  On appeal, the Board \namended this ruling to permit the supervising teachers to \nvote subject to challenge.  See Joint Appendix (\"J.A.\") at 42 \n(Order of Dec. 19, 1996).\n\n     The election was held on January 8, 1997.  The union won \n25 to 12, with one challenged ballot.  At the pre-election \nconference, FSA did not challenge the ballots cast by super-\nvising teachers.  After the election, it filed the following \nobjections:  (1) the Union destroyed the laboratory conditions \nof the election by improperly appealing to racial prejudice \nduring the election campaign;  (2) the election was tainted by \nthe involvement of supervisory teachers in the election pro-\ncess;  (3) Union supporters engaged in improper electioneer-\ning during the voting;  (4) the Union engaged in misconduct \n\n\n\nwhen its agents improperly invaded the workplace;  and (5) \nthe election was invalid because the Union failed to file \nreports required by the Labor-Management Reporting and \nDisclosure Act (\"LMRDA\"), 29 U.S.C. ss 431(a), 431(b), 432 \n& 435.1  The Board's hearing officer, after four days of \ntestimony, issued a report which recommended that all of the \nobjections be overruled.  FSA filed exceptions with the \nBoard, but the Board rejected them and instead adopted the \nhearing officer's findings and conclusions.  The Decision and \nCertificate of Representative issued on October 17, 1997.  \nFSA refused to bargain with the Union on the ground--the \nsame raised in its objections--that the election was not \nconducted lawfully.  J.A. at 107 (Answer to Complaint).  The \nUnion filed a complaint with the Board, charging that FSA \nviolated sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the National Labor Rela-\ntions Act (\"NLRA\" or \"the Act\"), 29 U.S.C. s 158(a)(1) and \n(5), and the NLRB General Counsel subsequently brought an \nunfair labor practice charge against the agency.  The Board \ngranted the NLRB's motion for summary judgment, and FSA \nasks that we deny enforcement of the Board's order to \nbargain collectively.2  The NLRB cross-petitions for enforce-\nment.\n\n     We hold that FSA is estopped from attempting to litigate \nthe question whether the election was tainted by the involve-\nment of supervisors.  FSA waived its right to a ruling on \nwhether the supervising teachers are statutory supervisors \n\n__________\n     1 FSA also objected that the Union improperly threatened em-\nployees, made promises of monetary reward and made misrepresen-\ntations during the campaign.

Background\n\n\n     Teachers and administrators work in close proximity at \nFSA's Bryant Street site, serving 160 children aged two \nweeks to three years old.  Each classroom is staffed by a \nsupervising teacher, an assistant teacher, and teachers' aides.  \nWhen the Union began its organizing campaign in June 1996, \nracial discord already characterized relations between Afri-\ncan-American and Latina3 employees.  The supervisor of the \ncenter, Vivian Storey, who is African-American, testified that \nat some point before the Union's arrival, a Latina co-worker \ntold Storey that she could not socialize with her African-\nAmerican co-workers anymore because she had been ha-\nrassed by another Latina.  J.A. at 510.  In addition, the \nemployees took racially segregated lunch periods, with Latina \nworkers eating from 12:30 to 1:30 and African-Americans \nfrom 1:30 to 2:30 p.m.  J.A. at 552.\n\nThe Language Issue\n\n     The pivotal issue that drove a wedge between Latina and \nAfrican-American workers--the alleged presence of a policy \nlimiting use of Spanish in the classroom and front office--\nsurfaced well before the unionization campaign.  In early \n1996, there were a series of meetings among administrators \nin which the staff addressed, among other things, complaints \nabout Sandra Ramirez, who worked in the center's front \noffice and dealt with agency clients.  J.A. at 751-58 (testimo-\nny of Claudette Darley, operations manager).  At one such \nmeeting, according to Darley, one of Ramirez' supervisors, \nRamirez was instructed to speak English whenever she was \nin a group of people that included non-Spanish speakers.  \n\n__________\n     3 We use the term \"Latina\" to refer to employees whose first \nlanguage is Spanish because the Spanish-speaking employees at \nissue in this case are all women.\n\n\n\nJ.A. at 767.  Ramirez was told of an incident in which three \nAfrican-American parents were standing in the office while \nthe Latina staff conversed in Spanish, and Ramirez was \nwarned that this could be considered insulting by non-\nSpanish-speaking parents.  Id.;  see also J.A. at 797 (notes \nfrom 1/11/96 staff meeting).\n\n     The language issue arose again on June 5, 1996, when a \nstaff meeting was held among the teachers in Room 2.  \nAmong the teachers who attended were Phyllis Hogan, the \nAfrican-American supervising teacher for the room;  Edith \nRuiz, a Latina teachers' aide;  and Johnny Overton, an Afri-\ncan-American substitute teachers' aide.  According to testi-\nmony and contemporaneous hand-written notes from the \nmeeting (it is not clear from the record who served as note-\ntaker) a parent had complained about the Latina staff's \nspeaking Spanish to her son.  The notes from the meeting set \nforth the following:  \"It is appropriate to speak Spanish to \nchildren whose primary language is Spanish, as long as it is \nin accordance with their parents' wishes.  It is appropriate to \nspeak Spanish to Spanish-speaking parents in order to convey \ninformation or explain things more clearly.\"  J.A. at 796 \n(emphasis in original).  \"If a non-Spanish-speaking parent or \nstaff member is nearby when Spanish is being spoken, a staff \nmember will attempt to give a short explanation in English of \nwhat is being discussed so they don't feel unwelcome or \nuncomfortable;  Ex:  'Hi ___.  I was just explaining this \nmemo to ___.  I'll be right with you.' \"  Id.\n\n     Some time later in June, according to Ruiz, Ruiz was \nspeaking Spanish to a parent and Hogan came into the room.  \nHogan \"touched me on the shoulder and she told me, 'Re-\nmember.'  And then she told me ... that we were going to \nhave a short meeting,\" Ruiz testified.  J.A. at 706.  Once the \nchildren went down for their naps, Hogan asked Ruiz wheth-\ner she remembered that she should not speak Spanish, ac-\ncording to Ruiz, and Ruiz asked for a written policy regarding \nthe language issue.  J.A. at 706-07.  This was followed by a \ntense interaction between Storey, who subsequently inter-\nvened, and Ruiz;  Ruiz testified that Storey told her she was \nin America and should speak English, J.A. at 706, but Storey \n\n\n\f\ndenied this and recalled that she told Ruiz each employee \nneeded to be sensitive to other cultures, J.A. at 527.  \"My \nwords was to her that there is a whole lot of rules and \nregulations that I do not like,\" Storey testified, \"and I said if \nI could not follow the rules and stuff, then it was time for me \nto leave.\"  Id.\n\n     Also at the end of June, the teachers in Room 7/9 held a \nstaff meeting at which they discussed the use of Spanish.  \nNotes from this meeting reflect mounting tension over the \nissue.  Marva Stephens, the African-American supervising \nteacher in the classroom at the time, indicated on the \"Meet-\ning Outcome\" form that \"[t]o identify speech and language \nproblems, staff will use English then Spanish to enhance \nreceptive language skills, and to assist development by speak-\ning English.\"  J.A. at 804.  But Lourdes Perez, a Latina \nteachers' aide, wrote in Spanish her own version of what \nhappened at the meeting on the \"Meeting Outcome\" form.  \nPerez testified that her notation reads:  \" 'Today, June 26, our \nsupervisor once again has forbidden us.  She does not want \nus to talk Spanish in the rooms.  And that she does not care \nwhat the Union' has said....\"  J.A. at 726.  At the hearing, \nStorey denied directing Stephens to implement an \"English-\nonly\" language policy.  J.A. at 570.\n\nThe Organizing Campaign\n\n     In their testimony Storey and other higher-ranking em-\nployees all unequivocally denied that FSA ever had an \"En-\nglish-only\" language policy, but Latina employees felt that \ntheir supervisors were increasing pressure on them to stop \nspeaking Spanish.  When the Union began to hold meetings \namong employees in the prospective bargaining unit in the \nsummer of 1996, J.A. at 512, the language issue was one of \nthe first workplace problems that the Latina employees men-\ntioned to Union organizer Ruben Garcia.  J.A. at 719 (testi-\nmony of Lourdes Perez);  J.A. at 735 (testimony of Ruben \nGarcia).  Garcia testified that he referred the employees to \nLa Raza Central Legal, a public interest law organization \nwhich specializes in Latino issues, in an effort to extricate the \n\n\n\f\nunion from the language issue because it \"in my experience [ ] \nshows to be a divisive issue.\"  J.A. at 735.  Garcia also \ntestified that the Union never distributed literature address-\ning the language issue.  J.A. at 739.  Not surprisingly, the \nunion drive was still racially divisive.  Two African-American \nemployees, Art Marshall, the cook at FSA, and Ann Douglas, \na substitute teachers' aide, testified that they initially attend-\ned some Union meetings.  As the campaign continued into \nthe fall, however, Garcia conducted the meetings primarily in \nSpanish, with English translation.  Marshall and Douglas \nthought that they were being denied a full understanding of \nwhat was said at the meetings, and Marshall, who had \napproached Garcia several times about his concerns that \nAfrican-Americans had been left out of the organizing efforts, \nfelt that the Union did not care about the concerns of \nAfrican-American workers.  Marshall said:\n\n     ... I even told him [Garcia], hey man, ... some of the \n     blacks kind of like want to bow out of this because we \n     feel like our issues aren't being met and most of the \n     Chicano issues are.\n\n          He said, well, we'll get with that, you know.... I even \n     told him how to go about bringing the blacks back into \n     the thing, but he kind of like ignored it, overlooked it \n     or--that's the way I look at it.\n\n     ....\n\n          I just said that I think we should, you know, we should \n     try to get together, you know, and keep blacks involved \n     in this, because I was still strongly for the Union and \n     then he kept saying, ... we'll deal with it, and that never \n     came.  It never happened.\n\n          ... I think the issues were for the Spanish and not me \n     as a black man.\n\nJ.A. at 639-41.  Hogan and teachers' aide Shereece Cooks, \nalso African-American, were approached at different times by \nLatino employees about the Union, but they neither received \nany Union literature nor were they asked to sign authoriza-\ntion cards.  Overton testified that she was never approached \n\n\nby a Union organizer or supporter.4  By mid-fall, Marshall \nand Douglas stopped attending Union meetings.  After the \nelection, when a Union organizer called Douglas and invited \nher to a victory party, it was, in her view, a day late and a \ndollar short;  Douglas refused to attend.  J.A. at 621-22.\n\nThe Press Event\n\n     Workplace tensions skyrocketed when, on September 20, \n1996, a television station came to Bryant Street and inter-\nviewed Latina employees about the language issue during the \n12:30 lunch hour.  According to a San Francisco Examiner \narticle that featured the same interviews, the employees \naccused the management at FSA, and Storey in particular, of \npreventing them from speaking Spanish on the job through \nharassment and intimidation.  J.A. at 773.  Assistant teacher \nReyna Ferreira was quoted as saying, \" 'Whenever [Vivian \nStorey, the site supervisor] or the other superiors hear us \nspeak Spanish, they come up and say \"English, English, \nEnglish.\" ' \"  Id.  Perez was also quoted:  \" 'Our supervisors \nlook at us like we're bad, like we're criminals because we \nspeak Spanish.' ... 'Vivian says to us, \"You are in America.  \nYou have to learn English.\" ' \"  Id.  No African-American \nemployees or managers from the Bryant Street site were \ninterviewed, although Shereece Cooks testified that she saw \nthe Latina employees ask Art Marshall if he would go on \ncamera.  J.A. at 577-78.\n\n     The identity of the organizer of this press event was \ndisputed during the hearing, and FSA argues here that the \nUnion sponsored it.  Garcia denied this and testified that he \nthought a lawyer from La Raza had contacted the media.  \nGarcia was present at the event but he did not speak on \ncamera;  witnesses saw him chatting with employees after \nthey had been interviewed.  Sandra Ramirez was under the \n\n__________\n     4 Various witnesses acknowledged, however, that Garcia visited \nthe Latina lunch hour, and not the later one attended by African-\nAmericans, because Storey and other supervisors usually ate during \nthe later period.\n\n\n\f\nimpression that the other Latina employees at FSA had \ncontacted the press.\n\n     After this publicity, African-American employees were livid \nand the racial divide widened.  \"[F]rom then on, they [Afri-\ncan-American co-workers] changed their attitude towards us \na lot and they didn't treat us the same, and ... they looked at \nus badly,\" Lourdes Perez testified.  J.A. at 491.  Ann Doug-\nlas said that the Latina employees \"stopped speaking, some of \nthem.  When I would walk [into her classroom] in the morn-\ning and say good morning, some of them would speak, some \nwouldn't, and I would go on one side of the room, on the other \nside with my kids....\"  J.A. at 618.  Marshall said that he \nfeared physical violence would erupt.  J.A. at 649.  In Octo-\nber, Cooks, Overton and Douglas all complained to Storey \nthat they felt they were being taunted by the Latina employ-\nees who continuously spoke only Spanish in their presence, an \noccurrence that became more frequent after the press inter-\nviews.\n\nThe Radio Interview\n\n     In November 1996, Garcia arranged an interview with \nhimself, Ramirez and Perez at a Spanish-language radio \nstation in San Francisco.  The three talked, in Spanish, about \nthe language policy problem at FSA.  Perez said in the \ninterview that \"Even with the parents themselves who don't \nunderstand the language, English, we're told that we have to \ntalk to them in English even though they [ ] talk to us in \nSpanish....\"  J.A. at 779.  Garcia explained that his Union \nwas trying hard to organize the public sector because \"there \nare many conditions similar to what Sandra and Lourdes are \nexpressing here.\"  J.A. at 792.  He continued, \"[W]e also \nfound that there were other workers, non-Latinos who were \nalso suffering from mistreatment and from, from low wages \nand exploitation that they were enduring.  That is we came to \nfind out that there were many more problems than about \nSpanish but the Spanish problem was one that stood out \nbecause of the magnitude of it.\"  J.A. at 793.  Ramirez and \nPerez played a tape of the interview during the lunch hour of \n\n\n\f\nthe Latina employees, although there is no evidence that any \nAfrican-American workers heard the broadcast.  Jones testi-\nfied that she heard someone utter the words, in English, \n\"black monkey,\" but she did not know whether the words \ncame from the tape or from Perez, who was in the room.  The \ntranscript from the interview does not contain those words in \nEnglish or Spanish.  J.A. at 774-95.  Soon after, at Thanks-\ngiving, the traditional school-wide potluck degenerated into \ntwo separate luncheons, one for African-Americans and one \nfor Latinas.\n\nThe Workplace Visits\n\n     During the organizing period, Garcia and another Union \norganizer, Doris Mitchell,5 occasionally came to the Bryant \nStreet premises to talk to employees, usually during the 12:30 \nlunch hour.  Storey testified that she saw Mitchell \"six or \nseven times\" on the premises, but Storey's only confrontation \nwith Mitchell occurred in August 1996, when she came across \nMitchell conversing with employees in the lunchroom.  Storey \nopened the door and closed it, and thought she heard Mitchell \nshouting and laughing at her.  This happened again, and \nStorey left.  Mitchell left shortly thereafter.  J.A. at 540-41.  \nLater, in early December, Storey had an encounter with \nGarcia, who was in the lunchroom during the 12:30 period.  \nStorey asked Garcia to leave, and he refused.  J.A. at 544. \nStorey left to go to her office to call the police, and Garcia \n\"came up to the office and he said to me he had every right \nto, in a loud manner, to be there.\"  Id.  Garcia announced \nthat he would stay until 1:30 and then depart--which he did.  \nThe police were never summoned and there were apparently \nno witnesses to the encounter in the office.  J.A. at 545.\n\nThe Vote\n\n     On January 8, 1997, the day of the election, there was a \npre-election meeting with the NLRB agent to discuss the \nrules for voting.  Witnesses agreed that the Board agent did \n\n__________\n     5 Mitchell is African-American and ran the first few Union meet-\nings in the summer of 1996, until Garcia took over.\n\n\n\nnot establish a \"no-electioneering\" zone and did not issue \nrules governing the conduct of employees during the voting \nperiod.  An FSA employee, Jaynie Lara, was appointed to \nread the voting \"script\" to the workers in each classroom and \nto escort employees from their classrooms or the office to the \nlunchroom, where votes were cast.  At one point during the \nhour and a half voting period, according to Lara, she told an \non-call cook, Arturo Martinez, to sit in a chair outside the \nlunchroom, which was off the main hallway, and wait his turn \nto vote.  For approximately 20 minutes, Martinez spoke to \nthe voters who, one-by-one, entered and exited the lunch-\nroom.  Lara estimated the number of voters whom Martinez \naddressed as 10.

The \nhearing officer rejected this objection, we think reasonably.\n\n     We begin with the law that governs the use of race-based \nmessages in union campaigns.  The principle that the party \nchallenging the election bears the burden of proving its \ninvalidity gives way if the party that prevailed in the election \nused racial propaganda in an irrelevant and inflammatory \nmanner.  If the prevailing party inflamed racial prejudice to \ngarner pro- or anti-union support, then it must prove that its \nrace-laden statements were truthful and germane to the \n\n\n\f\nunionization effort.  The Board has articulated the perimeters \nof racially charged but permissible campaign statements and \nmessages:\n\n          ... [A] relevant campaign statement is [not] to be \n     condemned because it may have racial overtones....  \n     We would be less than realistic if we did not recognize \n     that such statements, even when moderate and truthful, \n     do in fact cater to racial prejudice.  Yet we believe that \n     they must be tolerated because they are true and be-\n     cause they pertain to a subject concerning which employ-\n     ees are entitled to have knowledge....\n\n          So long, therefore, as a party limits itself to truthfully \n     setting forth another party's position on matters of racial \n     interest and does not deliberately seek to overstress and \n     exacerbate racial feelings by irrelevant, inflammatory \n     appeals, we shall not set aside an election on this ground.  \n     However, the burden will be on the party making use of \n     a racial message to establish that it was truthful and \n     germane, and where there is doubt as to whether the \n     total conduct of such party is within the described \n     bounds, the doubt will be resolved against him.\n\nSewell Manuf.

See Sumter \nPlywood, supra note 6, at 925 (\"the reversal of burden of persua-\nsion occurs if the racial remarks 'form the core or theme of the \ncampaign,' or if the statements are racially inflammatory\") (citation \nomitted);  Bancroft Manuf., 516 F.2d at 442-43.  Instead, we adopt \n\n\n     It is permissible for a union to promulgate a message that \nis wholly relevant and accurate, even though it implicates \nrace.  A \"union's claim that management discriminated on the \nbasis of race, sex and national origin [is] not an inflammatory \nracial appeal.\"  State Bank of India, 808 F.2d at 542;  cf. \nUtell Int'l, 750 F.2d at 178-79.  The hearing officer in this \ncase reasonably concluded that the Union's and employees' \nstatements and actions regarding the language issue amount-\ned to no more than a claim of discrimination.  Lourdes Perez' \nnotation on the June 26 meeting form that Latina employees \nhad been forbidden from speaking Spanish, the subsequent \nskirmishes over language issues between Latina employees \nand their supervisors, Latina employees' complaints to the \nnews media that their supervisors harangued them to speak \nEnglish, and the similar comments made during the radio \ninterview do not appear to be empty claims aimed at provok-\ning racial hatred.  We reach this conclusion without deciding \nwhether these acts were attributable to the Union.  See \nNLRB v. Herbert Halperin Distributing Corp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492649\"><a href=\"/opinion/492649/national-labor-relations-board-v-herbert-halperin-distributing-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, \n291 (4th Cir. 1987) (question is whether the \"amount of \nassociation between the union and the [employees] is signifi-\ncant enough to justify charging the union with the conduct\") \n(quotation omitted).  By so doing, we subject the Union to a \nstandard more stringent than that other courts have required \nwhen examining the actions of third parties:  Where the \nUnion sponsored the race-based message, the election must \nbe set aside if the message was inflammatory and inspired an \natmosphere of fear and coercion.  Cf. id. at 290 (election set \naside because of third-party conduct only if election was held \nin \"a general atmosphere of confusion, violence, and threats of \nviolence...\") (citation omitted).  Even assuming arguendo \nthat the Union was responsible for the turmoil over the \nalleged existence of a language policy, we are unable to \n\n__________\nthe Second and Seventh Circuits' sliding scale approach, in which \nwe assess together the degree of the message's relevance and \nimportance.

Otherwise, the promul-\ngation of a \"core\" yet tempered and relevant race-based message \nwould unnecessarily require further and redundant examination.\n\n\n\f\nidentify any statements or actions it made that were so \ninflammatory and irrelevant that the Board's contrary conclu-\nsion must be overturned.  The comments reported in the San \nFrancisco Examiner article and the statements made in the \nradio interview appear to us, as to the Board, to be reason-\nably accurate descriptions of the situation as Garcia and the \nLatina employees perceived it to be and not calculated to \nspark racial prejudice.8  Written records--namely, from the \nJune 5 staff meeting in Room 2--and the testimony of Vivian \nStorey as to her encounters with Latina employees may tend \nto support FSA's contention that there was no official \"En-\nglish-only\" policy.  However, the hearing officer found that \nemployees' testimony to the contrary was credible, and it is \nnot necessary to determine whether there actually existed an \nestablished English-only policy;  the relevant point is that the \nBoard could reasonably find, in this conflicted record, that the \nLatina employees' allegations that one existed were not reck-\nless, capricious, or otherwise emblematic of an intent to \ninvoke racial hatred. The subsequent conflict over the use of \nSpanish in the presence of non-Spanish speaking employees, \nthe complaints by African-American workers about feeling \nexcluded among Spanish speakers, and the racial bifurcation \nof the Thanksgiving dinner illustrate the racial tension at \n\n__________\n     8 FSA asserts that Garcia made inflammatory misrepresentations \nto the Latina employees by telling them that they had an \"absolute \nright\" to speak Spanish on the job.

See Utell, \n750 F.2d at 179-80 (in case of alleged misrepresentation, Board is to \nconsider, inter alia, other party's opportunity to correct the misrep-\nresentations before invalidating election).\n\n\n\f\nFSA but do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the \nUnion was igniting prejudice.  The hearing officer did not \ncredit Jones' testimony that the words \"black monkey\" were \nactually uttered, J.A. at 67, and there is no reason in the \nrecord for us to disturb this finding.  See E.N. Bisso & Son, \n84 F.3d at 1444-45 (hearing officer is \"uniquely well-placed to \ndraw conclusions about credibility\") (citation and quotation \nomitted).\n\n     We stress that we do not endorse what appears from most \naccounts to have been a palpable disinterest by the Union in \nnon-Latino workers and the resulting de facto segregation of \nemployees during the organizing drive.  See Sumter Ply-\nwood, 535 F.2d at 926 (\"This concentration on voters of one \nrace, to the relative exclusion of voters of the other, is \ndisturbing and is not to be condoned\").  Yet even considering \nthis lamentable behavior towards African-American workers, \nwe nonetheless agree with the Board that there was nothing \nin this tendentious campaign that made \"impossible a sober, \ninformed exercise of the franchise.\"  Sewell Manuf., 138 \nN.L.R.B. at 71.\n\n     B.Supervisory Taint in the Election Process\n\n     FSA objected that the \"petition and election process were \nunlawfully tainted by the inclusion of statutory supervisors,\" \nJ.A. at 44.  The threshold question in a supervisory taint \nclaim is, of course, whether the accused parties were in fact \n\"supervisors\" under the NLRA.  See Westwood One Broad-\ncasting Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), enforced </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> \n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1352</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1998).  This issue could have been litigated \nat FSA's behest during the representation stage of these \nproceedings.  In fact, FSA initially challenged the presence of \nsupervising teachers in the bargaining unit. See 29 U.S.C. \ns 152(3) (excluding from its definition of covered \"employee \n... any individual employed as a supervisor\").  After a \nhearing on the matter, the Regional Director found that the \nsupervising teachers were not statutory supervisors under \nthe NLRA, but on appeal the Board amended the Regional \nDirector's decision to permit the teachers to vote subject to \nchallenge.  See J.A. at 101 n.3 (Decision and Certification of \n\n\n\f\nRepresentative, October 17, 1997).  At the pre-election con-\nference, the Employer's representative explicitly withdrew \nthe challenge to the eligibility of the supervising teachers.  \nSee id.\n\n     In issuing its Certificate of Representative, the Board \ndenied FSA's post-election objection based on supervisory \ntaint because it was \"in the nature of postelection challenges \nwhich the Board has held that it will not entertain.\"  J.A. at \n101.  The Board has long refused to hear challenges to votes \nbrought for the first time after an election, as well as objec-\ntions that are merely reformulated challenges to votes.  See, \ne.g., NLRB v. A.J. Tower Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104344\"><a href=\"/opinion/104344/nlrb-v-aj-tower-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (1946);  Prior \nAviation Serv., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 n.3 (1975) (listing \ncases).  The difference between objections and challenges is \nthat \"[o]bjections relate to the working of the election mecha-\nnism and to the process of counting the ballots accurately and \nfairly.  Challenges, on the other hand, concern the eligibility \nof prospective voters.\"  A.J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. at 334.  The \nban on post-election challenges is traditionally employed \nwhen one party files a post-election \"objection\" that directly \nchallenges the eligibility of a voter that was not raised \npreviously.  See Prior Aviation Serv., Inc., supra, at 460 (ban \non post-election challenges applied to objection that alleged \nemployee \"was an ineligible voter by reason of his superviso-\nry status\").  Otherwise, as the Supreme Court has observed, \nlosing parties would be able to lodge attacks on elections ad \ninfinitum, \"delay[ing] the finality and statutory effect of the \nelection results.\"  A.J. Tower Co., 329 U.S. at 332.\n\n     The Board in this case not unreasonably relied on the ban \non post-election challenges to bar FSA's attempt to revisit the \nissue of the teachers' supervisory status after the election, \nsince FSA had explicitly abandoned that same challenge \nbefore the election.  But it is not clear that the ban will take \nit the whole way, because, as noted above, it has traditionally \nbeen limited to challenges to votes or the constituency of the \nbargaining unit.  However, the Board does allude briefly to a \ncollateral estoppel argument which we find more compelling, \nthat is, that a party such as FSA here cannot specifically \nwithdraw its challenge to certain voters as supervisors and \n\n\n\f\nlater allege that they are indeed supervisors whose partic-\nipation in the disputed election has \"tainted\" it.  See J.A. at \n101 n.3.\n\n     Thus, since FSA withdrew its challenge to the supervisory \nstatus of the teachers pre-election, it was subsequently es-\ntopped from litigating the issue post-election, and as the \nBoard found in its Decision and Order in the instant section \n8(a)(5) refusal-to-bargain proceeding, see J.A. at 135, cannot \nnow reopen the record of the representation proceeding to \nattempt again to litigate this issue.  Board rules bar reopen-\ning the record to litigate issues in related unfair labor prac-\ntice proceedings that the Board could have reviewed in the \nrepresentation proceeding.  See 29 C.F.R. s 102.67(f).9  And \nFSA \"fail[ed] to request review\" of whether a supervising \nteacher is a statutory supervisor prior to the election, thereby \nprecluding it from \"relitigating, in any related subsequent \nunfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or \ncould have been, raised in the representation proceeding.\"  \nId.  We have, it is true, previously held that a union is not \nbarred under this rule from relitigating representation issues \nwhen it brings unfair labor practice charges under sections \n8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3)10 of the NLRA because such charges do not \n\n__________\n     9 Section 102.67(f) states:  \"The parties may, at any time, waive \ntheir right to request review.  Failure to request review shall \npreclude such parties from relitigating, in any related subsequent \nunfair labor practice proceeding, any issue which was, or could have \nbeen, raised in the representation proceeding.  Denial of a request \nfor review shall constitute an affirmance of the regional director's \naction which shall also preclude relitigating any such issues in any \nrelated subsequent unfair labor practice proceeding.\"\n\n     10 These sections provide, in relevant part:\n\n     (a) Unfair labor practices by employer\n\n     It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer--\n\n     (1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the \n     exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;\n\n     ...\n\n\nconstitute a \"related subsequent unfair labor practice pro-\nceeding\" (emphasis added).

In this case, the Board agent did not designate a \n\"no-electioneering zone\" outside of the lunchroom.

In Pepsi-Cola Bottling, however, \nthe Board determined that this \"no electioneering\" zone \nexisted where employees waited in line to vote.  By contrast, \nas the Board correctly found in the instant case, employees \ndid not wait outside the lunchroom to vote.  There was thus \nno area where employees stood as a captive audience, waiting \nto cast their ballots, that should have been considered off-\nlimits as a matter of law.  Applying the other factors, the \nemployees did not act contrary to any of the instructions of a \nBoard agent, see Star Expansion Indus.

Nor does FSA contend that it objected to \nthe activities of the Union's supporters at the time employees \nentered or exited the voting place.\n\n     Finally, the general \"nature and extent\" of the electioneer-\ning in this case did not substantially impair employees' ability \nto exercise free will at the ballot box.  The Board reasonably \nfound that the combined effect of the relatively brief inter-\nludes of electioneering by teachers as voters exited and \nentered classrooms 5 and 7/9, as well as Martinez' occasional \ncomments as he sat outside the lunchroom waiting to vote, \nwas not coercive.

That \nthe classrooms were located just across the hall from the \nvoting area is acknowledgedly troubling, because it allowed at \nleast some voters to be subjected to pro-union campaigning \nup to the last moments before they cast their ballots.  Simi-\nlarly, the Union supporters' inquiries to voters leaving the \npolling place as to how they cast their ballots is not paradig-\nmatic of sterile \"laboratory conditions.\"  However, ultimately, \nwe defer to the Board's reasoned conclusion that neither of \nthese occurrences tend to intimidate voters in light of the fact \nthat employees were not standing in line to vote as a captive \naudience to the union supporters' comments, there was no \"no \nelectioneering\" zone, and further, that no evidence was ad-\nduced that voters were forced to contend with a constant \nbarrage, as opposed to an intermittent sprinkling, of pro-\nunion advocacy.\n\n     D.Union Agents' Invasion of the Workplace\n\n     FSA also alleged that \"Union agents repeatedly invaded \nthe employer's workplace during working times to engage in \nelectioneering with employees, deliberately creating hostile \nconfrontations with management and refusing to leave when \nlawfully asked to do [sic].\"  J.A. at 45.  This objection must \nalso fail.  When a party to an election is alleged to have \nengaged in conduct requiring the overturning of the election \nresults, the Board, and we, employ a standard similar to the \none used with allegations of improper electioneering.  \"[T]he \nBoard judges the conduct by assessing whether it 'reasonably \ntend[ed] to interfere with the employees' free and uncoerced \nchoice in the election.' \" NLRB v.

The factors the Board consid-\ners include:  the number of incidents of misconduct;  the \nseverity of the incidents and whether they were likely to \ncause fear among the employees in the bargaining unit;  and \nthe proximity of the misconduct to the election date.

Site Supervisor \nStorey's brief run-in with Mitchell could hardly be described \nas likely to induce fear among employees;  it was not confron-\ntational and there is no evidence that Mitchell was even asked \nto leave.  Although there were witnesses to Storey's initial \nencounter with Garcia, that encounter consisted only of Gar-\ncia's telling Mitchell that he had a right to be on the premis-\nes.  The evidence does not reflect that there were any \nwitnesses to the subsequent, slightly more rancorous encoun-\nter in the office.  Even so, whatever employee angst may \nhave resulted from these two encounters surely dissipated by \nelection day--one incident occurred five months and the other \none month before the election.

FSA asserted that \"the \nunion's refusal to file was a violation of employees' Section 7 \nrights to know about union finances and other matters in \norder to make an informed election choice....\"  Id.  The \nLMRDA requires labor unions to file certain financial disclo-\nsure reports.  See 29 U.S.C. ss 431(a), 431(b), 432 & 435;  see \n\n\n\f\ngenerally Brennan v.

Section 2(5) of the NLRA, which makes no reference \nto these reporting requirements, merely defines a \"labor \norganization\" as including \"any organization of any kind ... \nin which employees participate and which exists for the \npurpose, in whole or in part, of dealing with employers \nconcerning grievances, labor disputes, wages, rates of pay, \nhours of employment, or conditions of work.\"  29 U.S.C. \ns 152(5).  In the course of pre-election proceedings in the \ninstant case, the Regional Director concluded that compliance \nwith the LMRDA was not relevant to the union's status as a \nlabor organization under the NLRA.  See J.A. at 21-22.  The \nhearing officer, and the Board in turn, adopted this conclu-\nsion.  Desert Palace, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818 n.5 (1972) \n(\"The NLRB is not entrusted with the administration of the \n[LMRDA].

In a case in which a company \nargued that a labor union should not be entitled to an order \ndirecting an election because of, inter alia, numerous internal \nproblems and possible mob influence, the Board concluded:\n\n          The allegations made by [the company] ... concern \n     improper or corrupt practices in the administration of \n     internal union affairs.  In ... the [LMRDA], Congress \n     expressly dealt with such matters.  It is particularly signifi-\n     cant that the remedies provided in the LMRDA were given \n     to individual employees directly, and to the public through \n     the intervention of [other departments].  The theory un-\n     derlying this type of remedial legislation is not to \"illegal-\n     ize\" the organization itself, but to afford protection to all \n     parties concerned by creating specific Federal rights and \n     remedies whereby the activities of the organization and its \n     officers and agents are regulated and subjected to judicial \n     review in vindication of those rights.  Had Congress de-\n     sired to strike directly at the organization itself, Congress \n     would have said so.\n\n\n\f\nAlto Plastics Manuf.

In \noral argument, FSA attempted to distinguish Alto Plastics \nfrom this case because the company in Alto Plastics had \nsought directly to invoke the Board's jurisdiction to hear a \ncomplaint brought under the LMRDA, whereas here, FSA is \nnot asking the Board to adjudicate the LMRDA issue.  How-\never, this analysis ignores the basic point of Alto Glass, which \nis applicable here:  the LMRDA is simply \"not relevant or \nmaterial to the issue of [the Union's] status as a labor \norganization,\" at least in the circumstances of this case.  Id. \nat 851.11\n\n                                  Conclusion\n\n\n     For the reasons stated above, we deny FSA's petition for \nreview and grant the Board's petition for enforcement of its \nDecision and Order.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n__________\n     11 In oral argument and in the Reply brief, counsel for FSA \ncontended that the company's argument is not premised on compli-\nance with the NLRA's definition of a \"labor organization,\" but \nrather on the theory that a violation of employees' section 7 rights \nunder the NLRA is itself a form of election-related misconduct.  \nHowever, FSA has failed to point to any evidence in the record that \nwould show the alleged section 7 violation \"reasonably tend[ed] to \ninterfere with the employees' free and uncoerced choice in the \nelection.\"  Baja's Place, 268 N.L.R.B. at 868.  We therefore reject \nthis theory as well.\n\n                                               \n</pre>",
