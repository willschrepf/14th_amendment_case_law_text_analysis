(Minnesota Citizens), The\nTaxpayers League of Minnesota (Taxpayers League), and Coastal Travel Enterprises,\nLLC (Coastal Travel) (collectively, appellants), sued various Minnesota state officials\n(collectively, Minnesota),1 challenging the constitutionality of certain Minnesota\ncampaign finance laws. The district court denied the appellants’ motion for a\npreliminary injunction. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The appellants originally named as defendants the Minnesota Attorney\nGeneral, six members of the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board (Board), eight\nadministrative law judges of the Office of Administrative Hearings, and the Hennepin\nCounty Attorney. On March 1, 2011, the district court granted the administrative law\njudges’ and the Minnesota Attorney General’s motions to dismiss with prejudice,\nleaving only the Board members and the Hennepin County Attorney as defendants.\nThe dismissal is not at issue on this appeal.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fI.     BACKGROUND\n       The appellants are Minnesota business entities. Minnesota Citizens and\nTaxpayers League are nonprofit corporations and claim to be tax exempt under 26\nU.S.C. § 501(c)(4), which requires they be “primarily engaged in promoting in some\nway the common good and general welfare of the people of the community,” not to\ninclude “direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on\nbehalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.” 26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(4)-\n1(a)(2). Coastal Travel is a for-profit Minnesota limited liability company in the\ntravel services industry.\n\n        The appellants challenge certain provisions of Minnesota’s campaign finance\nlaws, claiming the provisions violate their free speech and association rights under the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as their equal protection rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the appellants claim Minnesota’s law\nimpermissibly violates their rights to make (1) contributions to candidates and\npolitical parties, and (2) independent expenditures advocating the election or defeat\nof a candidate.\n\n       The challenged provisions are part of Minnesota’s Campaign Finance and\nPublic Disclosure law, see Minn. Stat. § 10A.01 et seq., and Fair Campaign Practices\nlaw, see Minn. Stat. § 211B.01 et seq. These laws were amended in 2010, see 2010\nMinn. Sess. Law Serv. ch. 397, at 2001-08, after the Supreme Court held “the\n[g]overnment may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s corporate\nidentity” whether by “nonprofit or for-profit corporations,” Citizens United v. FEC,\n558 U.S. , , 130 S. Ct. 876, 913 (2010), and a federal district court determined\ncertain of Minnesota’s campaign finance laws were unconstitutional under Citizens\nUnited. See Minn. Chamber of Commerce v. Gaertner, 710 F. Supp. 2d 868, 870-73\n(D. Minn. 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       Minnesota prohibits corporations and limited liability companies from directly\nor indirectly contributing “to a major political party, organization, committee, or\nindividual to promote or defeat the candidacy of an individual for nomination,\nelection, or appointment to a political office.” Minn. Stat. § 211B.15, subdivs. 1 and 2.\nCorporations and limited liability companies may, however, make an independent\nexpenditure, see id. at subdivs. 2 and 3, defined as “an expenditure expressly\nadvocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, if the expenditure\nis made without the express or implied consent, authorization, or cooperation of, and\nnot in concert with or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate or any candidate’s\nprincipal campaign committee or agent.” Minn. Stat. § 10A.01, subdiv. 18.\n\n       Minnesota’s law provides two options for corporations and limited liability\ncompanies to participate in making independent expenditures. See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. Both options require compliance with certain organizational,\nrecord-keeping, and reporting requirements. Importantly, these laws reach not just\ncorporations and limited liability companies, but nearly all associations, see Minn.\nStat. § 10A.12, subdiv. 1a, regulating even the smallest partnership. See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.01, subdiv. 6 (“‘Association’ means a group of two or more persons, who are\nnot all members of an immediate family, acting in concert.”).\n\n      First, an association may indirectly make an independent expenditure “by\ncontributing to an existing independent expenditure political committee or political\nfund.” Id. An independent expenditure political committee—commonly referred to\nas a PAC—is an association, other than a principal campaign committee or political\nparty unit, “whose major purpose is to influence the nomination or election of a\ncandidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,” Minn. Stat. § 10A.01, subdiv. 27,\nand that only makes independent expenditures and other specified permissible\ndisbursements. See Minn Stat. § 10A.01, subdivs. 18a and 27; Minn. Stat. § 10A.121,\nsubdiv. 1. An independent expenditure political fund is “an accumulation of dues or\nvoluntary contributions by an association . . . collected or expended to influence the\n\n                                          -4-\n\fnomination or election of a candidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,” Minn.\nStat. § 10A.01, subdiv. 28, exclusively used to make independent expenditures and\nstatutorily-specified related expenses. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10.A.01, subdiv. 18b;\n10A.121, subdiv. 1.\n\n       The Board is responsible for administrating and enforcing Minnesota’s\ndisclosure laws and has the power to audit and investigate compliance issues. See\nMinn. Stat. § 10A.02. According to the affidavit of Gary Goldsmith, the executive\ndirector of the Board, a business corporation contributing its own money to an existing\nindependent expenditure political committee or fund typically would have to disclose\nonly its name and address to the recipient fund. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.27, subdivs.\n13 and 14. Goldsmith further explained a non-profit corporation that has donated\n$5,000 or more to independent expenditure political committees or funds must\ndisclose additional information related to the underlying source of the money.2 Id.\nat subdiv. 15.\n\n       For an association directly to make an independent expenditure, it must create\nand register its own independent expenditure political fund (political fund). See Minn.\nStat. § 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. Once an association forms a political fund, it must elect\nor appoint a treasurer and ensure the contents of the fund are not commingled with\nother funds. See id. subdivs. 2 and 3. According to Goldsmith, a political fund is\nsimply an “account,” and unless the association accepts contributions from others, it\nneed not use a separate “bank or depository account.” Instead, the association may\ntrack the funds used for independent expenditures using “an internal bookkeeping\ndevice, or something as simple as a spreadsheet.”\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       We offer no opinion as to whether Goldsmith’s explanation is an accurate\ninterpretation of Minnesota law.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f       The treasurer must register the political fund “by filing a statement of\norganization” with the Board. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.14, subdiv. 1. This filing must\noccur “no later than 14 days after the . . . [political] fund . . . has made a contribution,\nreceived contributions, or made expenditures in excess of $100.”3 Id. The filing must\ninclude the contact information for the association, the political fund, and the\ntreasurer, as well as a list of all depositories or safe deposit boxes used. See id. at\nsubdiv. 2.\n\n       For the life of the political fund, the treasurer must file annual reports detailing\nthe political fund’s activity. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 2. During general\nelection years—which occur every other year—the treasurer must file four additional\nreports; twenty-eight and fifteen days before a primary, and forty-two and ten days\nbefore a general election. See id. As the district court explained,\n\n       The report must disclose the amount of liquid assets at the beginning of\n       a reporting period; the name and address of each individual or\n       association whose contributions within the year exceed $100; the amount\n       and date of such contributions; the sum of contributions during the\n       reporting period; each loan made or received that exceeds $100; the\n       name and address of the lender; receipts over $100 during the reporting\n       period not otherwise listed; the sum of those receipts; the name and\n       address of each individual or association to whom the reporting entity\n       made expenditures within the year exceeding $100; the sum of all\n       expenditures made by the reporting entity during the reporting period;\n       the name and address of each political committee, political fund,\n       principal campaign committee, or party unit to which contributions in\n       excess of $100 were made; the sum of all contributions; the amount and\n       nature of any advance of credit incurred; the name and address of each\n       individual or association to whom noncampaign disbursements have\n\n       3\n       If the political fund receives from any one source either a loan or a contribution\nexceeding certain designated amounts (typically $1,000), the treasurer must register\nthe political fund by the end of the next business day. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.14,\nsubdiv. 1; 10A.20, subdiv. 5.\n\n                                            -6-\n\f      been made that aggregate in excess of $100 and the purpose of each\n      noncampaign disbursement; the sum of all noncampaign disbursements;\n      and the name and address of a nonprofit corporation that provides\n      administrative assistance to the political committee or political fund.\n\nMinn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 741 F. Supp. 2d 1115, 1122-23\n(D. Minn. 2010) (citing Minn. Stat. §10A.20). If the political fund has not received\nor expended money during a designated reporting period, the treasurer must file a\nstatement of inactivity.4 See Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 7.\n\n       The reporting requirements continue until the political fund is dissolved.\nBefore dissolution, the association must settle the political fund’s debts, dispose of all\nassets in excess of $100—including physical assets and credit balances—and file a\ntermination report disclosing the same information as required in periodic reports. See\nMinn. Stat. § 10A.24.\n\n       The treasurer must keep an account of contributions to the fund exceeding $20,\nincluding the name and address of each contributor and the date and amount of the\ncontribution. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.13, subdiv. 1 (1) and (2). The treasurer must also\nkeep account of the date and amount of the political fund’s expenditures. See id. at\n(3) and (4). The treasurer must maintain these records, with supporting\ndocumentation, and have them available for audit, inspection, or examination for four\nyears from the date of filing. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.025, subdiv. 3. Failure to do so\nis a misdemeanor. See id.\n\n      Associations and responsible individuals failing to comply with Minnesota’s\nregulatory scheme are subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, ranging from\n\n      4\n       Minnesota asked us to take judicial notice of the reporting form the Board has\nprovided for associations using their own money to make independent expenditures.\nThe front page of the form includes a box the treasurer may check if the association\nmade no independent expenditures since the last report.\n\n                                           -7-\n\ffines to imprisonment of up to five years. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.025, subdivs. 2 and\n3; 10A.12, subdivs. 1b and 6; 10A.121, subdiv. 2; 10A.13, subdiv. 1; 10A.14, subdiv.\n4; 10A.15, subdiv. 4; 10A.16; 10A.17, subdiv. 5; 10A.20, subdiv. 12; 10A.27, subdiv.\n13; 211B.15, subdivs. 6 and 7.\n\n       On July 7, 2010, the appellants filed a complaint against Minnesota and moved\nfor an expedited preliminary injunction the next day. The district court denied the\nmotion on September 20, 2010, primarily because it determined the appellants failed\nto establish a likelihood of success on the merits of any of their claims. On May 16,\n2011, a divided panel of this court affirmed the district court’s denial of the\npreliminary injunction. See Minn. Citizens Concerned for Life, Inc. v. Swanson, 640\nF.3d 304, 319 (8th Cir. 2011). We granted rehearing en banc and vacated the panel\ndecision.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n       A.     Preliminary Injunction Standards\n       Title 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) gives us jurisdiction to review the district court’s\ndenial of the preliminary injunction. We do so under an abuse of discretion standard.\nSee Planned Parenthood of Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, 530 F.3d 724, 733 (8th Cir.\n2008) (en banc). “An abuse of discretion occurs where the district court rests its\nconclusion on clearly erroneous factual findings or erroneous legal conclusions.” Id.\n(quoting Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 503-04 (8th Cir. 2006)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n       The “issuance of a preliminary injunction depends upon a ‘flexible’\nconsideration of (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the moving party; (2) balancing\nthis harm with any injury an injunction would inflict on other interested parties;\n(3) the probability that the moving party would succeed on the merits; and (4) the\neffect on the public interest.” Id. at 729 n.3 (quoting Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys.,\nInc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1991) (en banc)). When considering a “duly enacted\n\n                                          -8-\n\fstate statute,” a court must “make a threshold finding that [the plaintiff] is likely to\nprevail on the merits.” Id. at 732-33. “When a plaintiff has shown a likely violation\nof his or her First Amendment rights, the other requirements for obtaining a\npreliminary injunction are generally deemed to have been satisfied.” Phelps-Roper\nv. Troutman, 662 F.3d 485, 488 (8th Cir. 2011) (per curiam).\n\n       B.     Independent Expenditures\n       The appellants contend the district court abused its discretion by denying their\nmotion for a preliminary injunction because they will likely succeed on the merits of\ntheir claim that Minnesota’s campaign finance laws unconstitutionally infringe upon\nthe right to engage in political speech through independent expenditures. We agree.\n\n       Independent expenditures are indisputably political speech, and any restrictions\non those expenditures strike “at the core of our electoral process and of the First\nAmendment freedoms.” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 39 (1976) (quoting Williams\nv. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968)) (internal quotation marks omitted). And\n“[p]rotection of political speech is the very stuff of the First Amendment.”\nRepublican Party of Minn. v. White, 416 F.3d 738, 748 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc);\naccord Ariz. Free Enter. Club’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 565 U.S. ___, ___,\n131 S. Ct. 2806, 2817 (2011) (“[T]he First Amendment ‘has its fullest and most urgent\napplication to speech uttered during a campaign for political office.’” (quoting Eu v.\nSan Fran. Cnty. Democratic Cent. Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989))). Because\npolitical “[s]peech is an essential mechanism of democracy,” “the means to hold\nofficials accountable to the people,” “a precondition of enlightened self-government\nand a necessary means to protect it,” “political speech must prevail against laws that\nwould suppress it, whether by design or inadvertence.” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at\n___, 130 S. Ct. at 898.\n\n     “[P]olitical speech does not lose its First Amendment protection” because it\ncomes from a corporation. Id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 900. To the contrary, “restrictions\n\n                                          -9-\n\fdistinguishing among different speakers, allowing speech by some but not others” are\n“[p]rohibited,” and “the Government may commit a constitutional wrong when by law\nit identifies certain preferred speakers.” Id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 898-99; cf.\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828 (1995) (“In the\nrealm of private speech or expression, government regulation may not favor one\nspeaker over another.”). “The First Amendment protects speech and the speaker, and\nthe ideas that flow from each.” Id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 899. After Citizens United,\nit is clear Minnesota “may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s\ncorporate identity. No sufficient governmental interest justifies limits on the political\nspeech of nonprofit or for-profit corporations.” Id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 913; see Am.\nTradition P’ship, Inc. v. Bullock, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 132 S. Ct. 2490, 2491 (2012)\n(“There can be no serious doubt” “the holding of Citizens United applies to . . . state\nlaw.”).\n\n       Minnesota’s law does not prohibit corporate speech.5 The law does\n“distinguish[] among different speakers,” id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 898, forcing\ncorporations, or any other association, to establish a political fund if it spends more\nthan $100 on such speech in a given year.6 See Minn. Stat. § 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. The\ncollective burdens accompanying the creation and maintenance of a political\nfund—appointing a treasurer who becomes subject to civil and criminal penalties,\n\n      5\n       We reject the appellants’ contention that Minnesota’s law is an outright ban on\ncorporate speech, as was the federal law challenged in Citizens United. See Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897-98 (characterizing 2 U.S.C. § 441b as a ban\non corporate speech). Unlike the law in Citizens United, see id. at ___, ___, 130 S.\nCt. at 886, 897, Minnesota does not prohibit corporations from using corporate\ntreasury funds to make independent expenditures.\n      6\n       We recognize Minnesota allows associations to contribute to an existing\nindependent expenditure political committee or political fund. See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. But this option does not allow the association itself to speak.\nInstead it only allows the association to assist another entity in speaking. As soon as\nthe contribution is made, the association loses control of the message.\n\n                                          -10-\n\fsegregating funds, maintaining detailed records, and registering and filing ongoing\nreports with the Board, see supra at 5-8—are substantial. The regulatory requirements\nof an individual end as soon as he or she discloses a qualifying independent\nexpenditure to the Board, see Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 6, but a corporation or\nother association must continue to comply with these burdensome regulations even\nafter it stops speaking.\n\n      Minnesota’s law imposes virtually identical regulatory burdens upon political\nfunds as it does political committees. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.11, 10A.12, 10A.121,\n10A.13, 10A.14, 10A.15, 10A.17, 10A.20, 10A.24. This equality of burdens is\nmeaningful in view of past judicial efforts to ensure laws imposing PAC status and\naccompanying burdens are limited in their reach.\n\n       In Buckley, for example, the Supreme Court narrowly construed the federal\ndefinition of a PAC, see Buckley 424 U.S. at 74-80, to “only encompass organizations\nthat are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the\nnomination or election of a candidate.” Id. at 79. The Supreme Court reasoned this\nnarrow interpretation ensured the scope of the law was not “impermissibly broad.”\nSee id. at 79-80. Emerging from Buckley was the so-called major-purpose test, “a\njudicial construct that limits the reach of the statutory triggers . . . for [PAC] status.”\nColo. Right to Life Comm. v.

(MCFL), 479 U.S. 238, 262 (1986) (recognizing\nBuckley’s major-purpose test).\n\n       Since Buckley, some courts have invalidated state laws imposing PAC status\nand burdens upon organizations not meeting the major-purpose test. See N.M. Youth\nOrganized v. Herrera, 611 F.3d 669, 675-79 (10th Cir. 2010) (determining\norganizations did not qualify as PACs under the major-purpose test); N.C. Right to\nLife, Inc. v.

Sec’y of State, Fla., No. 11-14193, 2012 WL 1758607, at *1 (11th\nCir. May 17, 2012) (unpublished per curiam). By subjecting political funds to the\nsame regulatory burdens as PACs, Minnesota has, in effect, substantially extended the\nreach of PAC-like regulation to all associations that ever make independent\nexpenditures.\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized forcing a corporation to speak through a\nPAC creates “First Amendment problems” because of the associated regulatory\nburdens. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897; see also N.C. Right\nto Life, Inc., 525 F.3d at 296 (“[T]he Constitution makes clear that excessive\nregulation of political speech is suspect.”). In Citizens United, the Supreme Court\ncharacterized PACs as “burdensome alternatives” to direct corporate speech because\n“they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.” Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897. The Supreme Court highlighted\nrequirements substantially similar to those Minnesota imposes upon political funds.\n  See id. The Court surmised these “onerous restrictions” likely stop many\ncorporations from speaking through PACs. See id. at___, 130 S. Ct. at 897-98. We\nsurmise the same is true of Minnesota’s expansive regulation of political funds.\n\n      Perhaps most onerous is the ongoing reporting requirement. Once initiated, the\nrequirement is potentially perpetual regardless of whether the association ever again\nmakes an independent expenditure. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdivs. 2 and 7\n\n                                        -12-\n\f(requiring political funds to file five reports during a general election year, even if the\npolitical fund has been inactive during that period). The reporting requirements\napparently end only if the association dissolves the political fund. See id.; Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.24, subdiv. 1. To dissolve the political fund, the association must first settle\nthe political fund’s debts, dispose of its assets valued in excess of $100—including\nphysical assets and credit balances—and file a termination report with the Board.7 See\nid. Of course, the association’s constitutional right to speak through independent\nexpenditures dissolves with the political fund. To speak again, the association must\ninitiate the bureaucratic process again.\n\n       Under Minnesota’s regulatory regime, an association is compelled to decide\nwhether exercising its constitutional right is worth the time and expense of entering\na long-term morass of regulatory red tape. Suppose two Minnesota farmers owning\nadjoining property near a highway support a particular candidate for state office. The\nfarmers decide to erect a large sign in support of the candidate and spend over $100\nin supplies and labor. To comply with Minnesota’s law, the farmers must create and\nregister a political fund, appoint a treasurer, keep detailed records, and file ongoing\nreports with the Board. The farmers must continue to file even if the farmers do not\ncontinue to “speak.” To escape these ongoing burdens, the farmers must file a\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Upon notice to an association, Minnesota’s Board may force dissolution of an\n“inactive” political fund if “two years have elapsed since the end of a reporting period\nduring which the political . . . fund made an expenditure or disbursement requiring\ndisclosure under [the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Act].” Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.242, subdivs. 1 and 2. Until the Board provides such notice, an association\npresumably must continue to file reports on its inactive political fund. The statute is\nunclear as to what mechanism triggers the process of dissolving inactive political\nfunds. Regardless, an association wishing to retain its First Amendment right to make\nindependent expenditures must continue reporting on an ongoing basis.\n\n                                           -13-\n\ftermination statement. Before they can do that, they must dispose of the political\nfund’s assets—including the sign.8 If the farmers forget to file, or assume continued\nreporting is unnecessary, they are subject to significant fines and possible\nimprisonment.\n\n      Faced with these regulatory burdens—or even just the daunting task of\ndeciphering what is required under the law, see N.C. Right to Life, Inc., 525 F.3d at\n296 (noting campaign finance regulation has become “an area in which speakers are\nnow increasingly forced to navigate a maze of rules, sub-rules, and cross-references\nin order to do nothing more than project a basic political message”)—the farmers\nreasonably could decide the exercise is simply not worth the trouble. See MCFL, 479\nU.S. at 255 (plurality opinion) (“Faced with the need to assume a more sophisticated\norganizational form, to adopt specific accounting procedures, to file periodic detailed\nreports . . . it would not be surprising if at least some groups decided that the\ncontemplated political activity was simply not worth it.”). And who would blame\nthem?\n\n      Minnesota’s law hinders associations from participating in the political debate\nand limits their access to the citizenry and the government. The law manifestly\ndiscourages associations, particularly small associations with limited resources, from\n\n\n      8\n        At oral argument, Minnesota claimed the hypothetical farmers could terminate\nthe political fund at the same time they registered the fund. When pressed on the issue\nof whether the farmers would have to get rid of the sign before terminating, Minnesota\nclaimed the Board does not interpret the statute to require associations such as the\nfarmers to dispose of all physical assets before terminating the fund. But the statute\nsays otherwise. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.24, subdiv. 1 (“‘Assets’ include . . . physical\nassets.”). We do not expect potentially regulated associations to rely on Minnesota’s\ninformal assurance that it would not enforce the plain meaning of the statute.\n“Unguided regulatory discretion and the potential for regulatory abuse are the very\nburdens to which political speech must never be subject.” N.C. Right to Life, Inc.,\n525 F.3d at 290.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fengaging in protected political speech. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S.\nCt. at 897-98 (surmising the burdensome regulations might be the reason such a small\npercentage of corporations maintain PACs); MCFL, 479 U.S. at 254-55 & n.7\n(plurality opinion) (observing the regulatory burdens accompanying operation of a\nPAC “impose administrative costs that many small entities may be unable to bear”);\nN.C. Right to Life, Inc., 525 F.3d at 296 (surmising “[o]nly those able to hire the best\nteam of lawyers may one day be able to secure advisory opinions . . . or otherwise\nfigure out the myriad relevant rulings with any degree of assurance that they will\nescape civil and criminal sanctions for their speech”). In short, the collective burdens\nassociated with Minnesota’s independent expenditure law chill political speech.\n\n      This chill is more than a theoretical concern. All three appellants—two\nnonprofit issue advocacy groups and one for-profit travel-services provider—claim\nto have abandoned planned independent expenditures in order to avoid the\naccompanying regulatory burdens. If true, Minnesota’s law has “interfere[d] with the\n‘open marketplace’ of ideas protected by the First Amendment.” Citizens United, 558\nU.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 906.\n\n       The dissent minimizes this concern, stating “even the smallest business\nregularly files government forms and reports that are significantly more complicated\nand burdensome than the requirements of Minnesota’s disclosure laws.” Post at 35.\nWe disagree with such broad, unsupported conjecture, but assuming the statement is\ntrue, it misses the point. Most associations—no matter the size—are capable, for\nexample, of assembling and completing the paperwork necessary to file tax returns.\nBut such paperwork is not a burden interfering with the constitutionally protected\nmarketplace of ideas. Unlike compliance with the mandatory tax laws, the laws at\nissue here give Minnesota associations a choice—either comply with cumbersome\nongoing regulatory burdens or sacrifice protected core First Amendment activity.\nThis is a particularly difficult choice for smaller businesses and associations for whom\npolitical speech is not a major purpose nor a frequent activity. Such a disincentive for\n\n                                         -15-\n\fpolitical speech demands our attention. See MCFL, 479 U.S. at 255 (plurality\nopinion) (reasoning “[t]he fact that [a federal law’s] practical effect may be to\ndiscourage protected speech is sufficient to characterize [the statute] as an\ninfringement on First Amendment activities”).\n\n       Generally, “[l]aws that burden political speech are ‘subject to strict scrutiny,’\nwhich requires the [g]overnment to prove that the restriction ‘furthers a compelling\ninterest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.’” Citizens United, 558 U.S.\nat ___, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (quoting FEC v. Wis. Right to Life, Inc., 551 U.S. 449, 464\n(2007) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.)). But this is not true when the law at issue is a\ndisclosure law, in which case it is subject to “‘exacting scrutiny,’ which requires a\n‘substantial relation’ between the disclosure requirement and a ‘sufficiently important’\ngovernmental interest.” Id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 914 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64,\n66); accord Doe v. Reed, 561 U.S. ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. 2811, 2818 (2010).\n\n       The district court characterized the challenged provisions as a disclosure law\nand accordingly determined exacting scrutiny was appropriate. We question whether\nthe Supreme Court intended exacting scrutiny to apply to laws such as this, which\nsubject associations that engage in minimal speech to “the full panoply of regulations\nthat accompany status as a [PAC].”9 MCFL, 479 U.S. at 262. Allowing states to\n\n\n      9\n        The nature of the disclosure laws reviewed under exacting scrutiny in Citizens\nUnited were much different than Minnesota’s law. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. ___,\n130 S. Ct. at 913-16 (analyzing 2 U.S.C. §§ 441d(d)(2), 434(f)(1)). The federal law\nrequired filing a disclosure report only when a corporation (or anyone else) spent\nmore than $10,000 on electioneering communication (e.g., a television commercial)\nduring any calender year. See § 434(f)(4) and (g). Then, when a communication\ndisclosed “___ is responsible for the content of this advertising,” as required by\n§ 441d(d)(2), a citizen could identify the responsible party in public records and\ndiscover relevant information. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at\n915-16. This event-driven reporting requirement ended as soon as the report was\nfiled. See § 434(f)(4) and (g)(1) and (2). The effect of the laws—requiring one-time\n\n                                         -16-\n\fsidestep strict scrutiny by simply placing a “disclosure” label on laws imposing the\nsubstantial and ongoing burdens typically reserved for PACs risks transforming First\nAmendment jurisprudence into a legislative labeling exercise.\n\n       But even if exacting scrutiny is appropriate, see, e.g., Real Truth About\nAbortion, Inc. v. FEC, 681 F.3d 544, 548-49 (4th Cir. 2012) (applying exacting\nscrutiny to federal provisions imposing disclosure and organizational requirements);\nMcKee, 649 F.3d at 55-56 (applying exacting scrutiny review to Maine’s law defining\nPACs); Nat’l Org. for Marriage v. Daluz, 654 F.3d 115, 118 (1st Cir. 2011) (applying\nexacting scrutiny review to Rhode Island’s independent expenditure reporting\nrequirements); Brumsickle, 624 F.3d at 1003-05 (applying exacting scrutiny to\nWashington’s law defining PACs); SpeechNow.org v. FEC, 599 F.3d 686, 696 (D.C.\nCir. 2010) (en banc) (applying exacting scrutiny to federal laws imposing disclosure\nand organizational requirements),10 Minnesota’s law fails.\n\n\ndisclosure only when a substantial amount of money was spent—matched the\ngovernment’s disclosure purpose. In contrast, the effect of Minnesota’s ongoing\nreporting requirements, which are initiated upon $100 aggregate in expenditures, and\nare unrelated to future expenditures, does not match any particular disclosure interest.\nOther requirements, such as requiring a treasurer, segregated funds, and record-\nkeeping, are only tangentially related to disclosure.\n      10\n         We acknowledge the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, upheld a federal disclosure\nlaw with ongoing reporting requirements. See SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696-98;\nsee also 2 U.S.C. § 434(a)(4). But the law upheld in SpeechNow.org applies to far\nfewer associations than Minnesota’s law does. The ongoing reporting requirements\nat issue in SpeechNow.org applied to political committees under 2 U.S.C.\n§ 431(4)(A), meaning associations whose “major purpose . . . is the nomination or\nelection of a candidate,” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 79. See Emily’s List v. FEC, 581 F.3d\n1, 16 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (observing those entities required to “register with the FEC as\npolitical committees . . . [are entities that] receive or spend more than $1000 annually\nfor the purpose of influencing a federal election and whose ‘major purpose’ involves\nfederal elections”). Minnesota’s law has a much lower trigger of $100 in\nexpenditures, and more importantly, imposes the requirements on all associations,\n\n                                         -17-\n\f       Though possibly less rigorous than strict scrutiny, but cf. United States v.\nAlvarez, 567 U.S. ___, ___, 132 S. Ct. 2537, 2543, 2548, 2551 (2012) (plurality\nopinion) (describing exacting scrutiny, which the plurality applied to a content-based\nstatute, as the “most exacting scrutiny,” (quoting Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC,\n512 U.S. 622, 642 (1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted), and requiring the\ngovernment to use the “least restrictive means,” (quoting Ashcroft v. ACLU, 542 U.S.\n656, 666 (2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted), to accomplish its compelling\ninterests), exacting scrutiny is more than a rubber stamp. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 64,\n66 (describing exacting scrutiny as a “strict test” requiring more than a “legitimate\ngovernmental interest”). The Supreme Court has not hesitated to hold laws\nunconstitutional under this standard. See Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. ___, ___, 128 S. Ct.\n2759, 2774-75 (2008) (deciding certain federal disclosure requirements were\nunconstitutional under exacting scrutiny); Buckley v. Am. Constitutional Law Found.\n(ACLF), 525 U.S. 182, 186, 197-205 (1999) (deciding certain Colorado laws\nregulating its initiative and referendum petition process failed exacting scrutiny);\nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm’n, 514 U.S. 334, 336, 347-57 (1995) (holding an\nOhio law prohibiting the distribution of anonymous campaign contributions was\nunconstitutional under exacting scrutiny); Buckley, 424 U.S. at 39-51 (determining\na federal law limiting the amount of independent expenditures was unconstitutional);\ncf. Alvarez, 567 U.S. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 2542-43 (plurality opinion) (holding a\nfederal criminal law prohibiting false claims of receiving military decorations or\nmedals failed exacting scrutiny and violated the First Amendment).\n\n       As the Supreme Court recently reiterated when reviewing a disclosure law,\n“there must be a relevant correlation or substantial relation between the governmental\ninterest and the information required to be disclosed and the governmental interest\nmust survive exacting scrutiny.” Davis, 554 U.S. at ___, 128 S. Ct. at 2775 (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 64) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]he strength of the\n\n\nregardless of the association’s purpose.\n\n                                           -18-\n\fgovernmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First\nAmendment rights.” Id.; see also Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 362 (1976) (plurality\nopinion) (“The interest advanced must be paramount, one of vital importance, and the\nburden is on the government to show the existence of such an interest.”). Regulatory\nprovisions “no more than tenuously related to the substantial interests disclosure\nserves . . . ‘fail exacting scrutiny.’” ACLF, 525 U.S. at 204; accord McIntyre, 514\nU.S. at 347 (stating a law will withstand exacting scrutiny “only if it is narrowly\ntailored to serve an overriding state interest”).\n\n       Minnesota’s independent expenditure law almost certainly fails this test because\nits ongoing reporting requirement—which is initiated upon a $100 aggregate\nexpenditure, and is untethered from continued speech—does not match any\nsufficiently important disclosure interest. Minnesota can accomplish any disclosure-\nrelated interests—providing the electorate and shareholders information concerning\nthe source of corporate political speech, deterring corruption, and detecting violations\nof campaign finance laws—“[t]hrough less problematic measures,” ACLF, 525 U.S.\nat 204, such as requiring reporting whenever money is spent, as the law already\nrequires of individuals, see Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 6.\n\n       The dissent complains we discount Minnesota’s interests, resulting in “an\nunbalanced and flawed application of the exacting scrutiny analysis.” Post at 28. Our\ndiscussion of these interests is limited, however, not because we doubt their\nimportance, see generally Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 914-16\n(discussing the importance of the informational interests), but because Minnesota has\nnot stated any plausible reason why continued reporting from nearly all associations,\nregardless of the association’s major purpose, is necessary to accomplish these\ninterests. Cf. Alvarez, 567 U.S at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 2551 (plurality opinion)\n(reasoning the law restricting false statements failed exacting scrutiny because the\ngovernment did not make a “clear showing of the necessity of the statute” to\naccomplish the stated significant interests); see id. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 2251-52, 2255-\n\n                                          -19-\n\f56 (Breyer, J., concurring) (determining the statute failed intermediate scrutiny and\nthus violated the First Amendment because it was “possible substantially to achieve\nthe Government’s objective in less burdensome ways”).\n\n       Because Minnesota has not advanced any relevant correlation between its\nidentified interests and ongoing reporting requirements, we conclude Minnesota’s\nrequirement that all associations make independent expenditures through an\nindependent expenditure political fund, see Minn. Stat. § 10A.12, subdiv. 1a, is most\nlikely unconstitutional. The dissent is correct to stress that a high level of deference\nis appropriate because this is a duly enacted statute. Post at 26. But in cases such as\nthis, where we determine the appellants are likely to win on the merits of their First\nAmendment claim, a preliminary injunction is proper. See Phelps-Roper, 662 F.3d\nat 488. “Statutes suppressing or restricting speech must be judged by the sometimes\ninconvenient principles of the First Amendment.” Alvarez, 567 U.S. at ___, 132 S.\nCt. at 2543 (plurality opinion).\n\n       Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s denial of the appellants’ motion for\na preliminary injunction to the extent it requires ongoing reporting requirements from\nassociations not otherwise qualifying as PACs under Minnesota law.11 At this early\nstage of the litigation, we express no opinion as to whether any of the other\nobligations Minnesota imposed upon associations speaking through political funds\nwould, by themselves or collectively, survive exacting scrutiny. Neither do we have\noccasion at this point to decide whether it is appropriate to remedy any constitutional\ninfirmity, as Minnesota suggests, by severing Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 7 to\nremove the likely unconstitutional ongoing reporting obligations. See Neighborhood\n\n\n      11\n        Associations “whose major purpose is to influence the nomination or election\nof a candidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question” would still comply with the\nsame essential requirements because they are political committees. See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.01, subdiv. 27. Our holding does not affect Minnesota’s regulation of political\ncommittees.\n\n                                         -20-\n\fEnters. v. City of St. Louis, 644 F.3d 728, 738-39 (8th Cir. 2011) (remanding to the\ndistrict court to decide in the first instance the question of whether an unconstitutional\nstate provision was severable from the remainder of the statute).\n\n       C.     Contribution Ban\n       We next address the appellants’ challenge to Minnesota’s prohibition against\ncorporate political contributions. See Minn. Stat. § 211B.15, subdiv. 2. The\nappellants contend the district court erred in denying its motion for a preliminary\ninjunction against Minnesota’s ban on such contributions because it violates their\nrights of speech and association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\nas well as their equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. We detect\nno abuse of discretion.\n\n       We first address the appellants’ First Amendment argument. The appellants\nargue they are likely to enjoy merits success on their free speech and association claim\nagainst the contribution ban because Minnesota’s law conflicts with Citizens United’s\ninstruction that outright bans on political speech are impermissible. See Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 913. We disagree.\n\n      The crux of appellants’ argument is advanced under the following reasoning.\nContributing to a political campaign is a form of political speech, as well as\nassociation. See, e.g., Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20-21 (“A contribution serves as a general\nexpression of support for the candidate and his views.”). Constitutionally, a\ncorporation cannot be required to speak through a PAC. See Citizens United, 558\nU.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (reasoning a PAC exemption to a prohibition against\ncorporate independent expenditures “does not allow [a] corporation[] to speak”\nbecause “[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation”). Under Minnesota’s\nlaw, the only means for corporations to contribute to a political candidate or\ncommittee is through an “[e]mployee political fund,” see Minn. Stat. § 211B.15,\nsubdiv. 16, which the appellants claim is a PAC. Therefore, Minnesota’s law bans\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fcorporate political speech, a result that is contrary to the holding in Citizens United,\n558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n       The appellants’ syllogism fails to recognize the significant distinction the\nSupreme Court made in its review of laws restricting independent expenditures and\nlaws restricting contributions. Put simply, “restrictions on contributions require less\ncompelling justification than restrictions on independent spending.” FEC v.\nBeaumont, 539 U.S. 146, 158-59 (2003) (quoting MCFL, 479 U.S. at 259-60))\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court deemed “restrictions on\npolitical contributions . . . as merely ‘marginal’ speech restrictions subject to relatively\ncomplaisant review under the First Amendment, because contributions lie closer to the\nedges than to the core of political expression.” Id. at 161. Thus, “a contribution limit\ninvolving significant interference with associational rights passes muster if it satisfies\nthe lesser demand of being closely drawn to match a sufficiently important interest.”\nId. at 162 (quoting Nixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov’t PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 387-88 (2000))\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court in Citizens United recognized\nthe variance in the rigor of scrutiny used to review independent expenditures and\ncontributions, see Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 901-02, and neither\nendorsed nor condemned the distinction, see id. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 909 (explaining\nit was not asked to “reconsider whether contribution limits should be subjected to\nrigorous First Amendment scrutiny”); see also United States v. Danielczyk, 683 F.3d\n611, 617 (4th Cir. 2012) (recognizing that in Citizens United, the Supreme Court “did\nnot discuss Beaumont and explicitly declined to address the constitutionality of the\nban on direct contributions”); Ognibene v. Parkes, 671 F.3d 174, 183-84 (2d Cir.\n2012) (similar); Thalheimer v. City of San Diego, 645 F.3d 1109, 1124-26 (9th Cir.\n2011) (similar); Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield, 616 F.3d 189, 199 (2d Cir. 2010)\n(similar).\n\n      Using the “closely drawn” test, the Supreme Court in Beaumont upheld a\nfederal law banning direct corporate campaign contributions against an as-applied\n\n                                           -22-\n\fFirst Amendment challenge by a non-profit corporation. See Beaumont, 539 U.S. at\n149, 162-63 (upholding 2 U.S.C. § 441b). Like Minnesota’s law, the challenged\nprovision in Beaumont prohibited corporations from making election-related\ncontributions, but allowed corporations to establish, administer, and control a PAC,\nthrough which the corporation could solicit contributions. See id. at 149. The\nSupreme Court rejected the contention “the law violated the First Amendment in\nallowing contributions to be made only through [the corporation’s] PAC and subject\nto a PAC’s administrative burdens,” stating\n\n      The PAC option allows corporate political participation without the\n      temptation to use corporate funds for political influence, quite possibly\n      at odds with the sentiments of some shareholders or members, and it lets\n      the Government regulate campaign activity through registration and\n      disclosure, without jeopardizing the associational rights of advocacy\n      organizations’ members.\n\nId. at 163 (internal citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f        Rightly or wrongly decided,12 Beaumont dictates the level of scrutiny and the\npotential legitimacy of the interests Minnesota advances by prohibiting corporate\ncontributions to political candidates and committees. See, e.g., Agostini v. Felton, 521\nU.S. 203, 237 (1997) (“We reaffirm that ‘if precedent of this Court has direct\napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of\ndecisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving\nto this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.’” (quoting Rodriguez de\nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989))). In light of\nBeaumont, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the preliminary\ninjunction.\n\n        Finally, we address the appellants’ argument that Minnesota’s ban on direct\ncorporate contributions violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment because no legitimate governmental interest exists to justify imposing\nmore stringent regulations on corporations than unions. At this early stage of the\nlitigation, we are not prepared to hold the district court abused its discretion in\ndenying the preliminary injunction. We agree with the district court’s determination\n\n\n\n\n      12\n         Citizens United’s outright rejection of the government’s anti-distortion\nrationale, see Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 904, as well as the\nCourt’s admonition “that the State cannot exact as the price of [state-conferred\ncorporate] advantages the forfeiture of First Amendment rights,” id. at ___, 130 S. Ct.\nat 905 (quoting Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 680 (1990)\n(Scalia, J., dissenting)) (internal quotation marks omitted), casts doubt on Beaumont,\nleaving its precedential value on shaky ground. See also Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 164-\n65 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (explaining his belief that all campaign finance laws are\nsubject to strict scrutiny and the federal ban on corporate contributions was “not\nnarrowly tailored to meet any relevant compelling interest”); id. at 164 (Kennedy, J.,\nconcurring) (“Were we presented with a case in which the distinction between\ncontributions and expenditures under the whole scheme of campaign finance\nregulation were under review, I might join Justice Thomas’ dissenting opinion.”).\n\n                                         -24-\n\fthat Citizens United did not explicitly overrule the Supreme Court’s equal protection\nanalysis in Austin, 494 U.S. at 666-68.\n\n       This does not mean, however, that Austin controls the ultimate outcome of the\nappellants’ challenge. Under Austin, “statutory classifications impinging upon [the\nfundamental right to engage in political expression] must be narrowly tailored to serve\na compelling governmental interest.” Id. at 666; see also Dallman v. Ritter, 225 P.3d\n610, 634-35 (Colo. 2010) (holding a state law allowing corporations to contribute to\ncandidates, but forbidding labor unions from doing the same, violated the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment). We express no opinion as to the\nlikelihood Minnesota will meet this heavy burden in light of the Supreme Court’s\nrejection of the so-called anti-distortion rationale relied upon in Austin. See Citizens\nUnited, 558 U.S. at ___, ___, 130 S. Ct. at 903-08, 912-13.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n       We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the district court for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nMELLOY, Circuit Judge, with whom MURPHY, BYE and SMITH, Circuit Judges,\njoin, concurring and dissenting.\n\n       I concur in Section II.C. of the majority opinion. I agree that Minnesota's ban\non corporate political contributions is likely constitutional. However, I dissent as to\nthe analysis of Minnesota's reporting requirements. I believe the majority fails to fully\napply the holding of Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913–14. Citizens United\nextensively discussed and relied upon two fundamental principles. First, corporations\nhave a First Amendment right to speak through political contributions, id., 130 S. Ct.\nat 913, and second, the voting public has a right to know where the money is coming\nfrom, id. at 914. In my view, the majority gives short shrift to this second\nfundamental principle of Citizens United. Failure to honor this important public\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\finterest leads it to hold that the carefully crafted Minnesota disclosure legislation is\nlikely to be unconstitutional.\n\n       I would first note that the majority opinion cites, but fails to apply, our\ncontrolling precedent on the standard to be applied in enjoining a duly enacted state\nstatute. The majority cites the standard we articulated in Planned Parenthood of\nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota v. Rounds, that to succeed on a preliminary\ninjunction, a party must show that it \"is likely to prevail on the merits.\" 530 F.3d 724,\n730 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc). However, in my view, the majority ignores the reason\nwe require this more rigorous standard \"where a preliminary injunction of a duly\nenacted state statute is sought.\" Id. at 730. In imposing a higher standard in these\ncases, we seek to \"'reflect[] the idea that governmental policies implemented through\nlegislation or regulations developed through presumptively reasoned democratic\nprocesses are entitled to a higher degree of deference and should not be enjoined\nlightly.'\" Id. at 732 (quoting Able v. United States, 44 F.3d 128, 131 (2d Cir. 1995)\n(per curiam)). In my view, that is particularly true in cases such as this where we\nconsider whether to enjoin a statute in which the state legislature exercised its\nlegislative function of \"line drawing.\" Instead of deferring to the legislature, the\nmajority would instead impose its own judgment to determine that a $100 threshold\nfor requiring reporting is too low, that five disclosure reports in an election year are\ntoo many, and that the administrative costs of keeping records in accordance with the\nlaw are too high. These issues are typically and best left to Minnesota's\ndemocratically elected legislators.\n\n       Applying the Planned Parenthood standard, I would find Minnesota's disclosure\nlaws likely to be constitutional. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court held that\ncourts should consider disclosure requirements under the exacting scrutiny framework\nbecause those laws do not suppress speech by \"'impos[ing a] ceiling on campaign-\nrelated activities' [or] 'prevent[ing] anyone from speaking.'\" Citizens United, 130 S.\nCt. at 914 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64 (1976) and McConnell v. Fed.\n\n                                          -26-\n\fElection Comm'n, 540 U.S. 93, 201 (2003)). I agree with the majority that a\ndisclosure law might suppress speech and thus trigger strict scrutiny if it directly\nimposed limitations on speech, such as by requiring an association to speak through\na PAC or by limiting contributions or expenditures above a certain amount. However,\nI disagree with the majority's suggestion that strict scrutiny might apply to a law that\ndoes not directly limit speech simply because the burdens the law imposes are viewed\nas heavy enough to be an indirect limit. Subjecting disclosure laws to this type of\nanalysis is circular and conclusory; it requires a court to assess the burden of a\ndisclosure law to determine what level of scrutiny applies, then to evaluate that burden\nagain under exacting or strict scrutiny. This analysis also leads the majority to\nunderestimate the states' interests in disclosure laws and overestimate the burdens\nthose laws impose on speech. It is sufficient to consider the burdens disclosure laws\nimpose once, in the course of the exacting scrutiny analysis the Supreme Court has\nindicated is appropriate. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914.\n\n       The Minnesota disclosure laws do not directly suppress speech, and so exacting\nscrutiny is the appropriate framework for considering their constitutionality. The\nMinnesota laws neither prevent an association from speaking for itself, nor do they\nimpose any limit on the amount of speech in which an association can engage. First,\nthe laws do not require an association to speak through another entity to engage in\ncampaign-related speech. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court found such a\nrequirement particularly troubling because allowing a corporation to speak only\nthrough a separate association \"does not allow corporations to speak\" at all. Citizens\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 897. In contrast, under the Minnesota laws, a corporation does\nnot need to be a separate association from the political fund it establishes. Rather, it\ncan retain full control over the operations of a political fund it creates, including by\nappointing a corporate employee or officer as the fund's treasurer and by directing the\npolitical fund to return any excess contributions and dissolve. Thus, the Minnesota\nlaws avoid the constitutional infirmity the Supreme Court addressed in Citizens\nUnited. Secondly, unlike the PACs the Supreme Court considered in Citizens United,\n\n                                         -27-\n\funder the Minnesota laws a corporation can contribute an unlimited amount directly\nto its political fund, and the political fund can use these contributions to make\nexpenditures. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887–88. This contrasts with the\nrestrictions the Court confronted in Citizens United, under which corporations could\nonly use \"donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation\" for express\nadvocacy or electioneering communications. Id. at 888.\n\n       Under the exacting scrutiny framework, disclosure laws survive if the\ngovernment shows \"a relevant correlation or substantial relation between the\ngovernmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.\" Davis v. Fed.\nElection Comm'n, 554 U.S. 724, 744 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nother words, \"the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of\nthe actual burden on First Amendment rights.\" Id. I would hold that Minnesota's\ndisclosure laws meet this test and are likely to be constitutional.\n\n       Although Minnesota has pointed to several important state interests that its\ndisclosure laws serve, the majority opinion provides little discussion of these interests,\nother than to note they exist. See supra at 19. In my view, this apparent discounting\nof the state's interests and the resulting focus almost solely on the burdens the laws\nimpose presents an unbalanced and flawed application of the exacting scrutiny\nanalysis.\n\n       First, and most importantly, the state has an important interest in providing the\nvoting public with information about which associations and corporations support\nparticular issues and candidates. This is an interest that the Supreme Court has time\nand again found to be important. See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914\n(\"[D]isclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in providing the\nelectorate with information about the sources of election-related spending.\" (internal\nmarks and alterations omitted)); McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196 (\"providing the\nelectorate with information\" is an important state interest); Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n\n                                          -28-\n\f66–67 (\"[D]isclosure provides the electorate with information as to where political\ncampaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate in order to aid the\nvoters in evaluating those who seek federal office. It allows voters to place each\ncandidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the\nbasis of party labels and campaign speeches.\" (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)). In elections, it is important for voters to hear directly from candidates and\ncampaigns about their views on the issues. However, it is also important for voters\nto know which groups support or oppose a candidate or initiative; this information\nallows voters to better understand the political and practical ramifications of a ballot\nissue or the election of a candidate. As the Ninth Circuit explained, \"[k]nowing which\ninterested parties back or oppose a ballot measure is critical, especially when one\nconsiders that ballot-measure language is typically confusing, and the long-term\npolicy ramifications of the ballot measure are often unknown.\" Family PAC v.\nMcKenna, --- F.3d ---, 2012 WL 266111, at *5 (9th Cir. Jan. 31, 2012) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      Our sister circuits have found this informational interest important even with\nrespect to smaller expenditures:\n\n      The public has an interest in knowing [] that a ballot measure has been\n      supported by a multitude of gifts, even small gifts, from a particular state\n      or from a specific profession. . . . The issue is thus not whether voters\n      clamor for information about each \"Hank Jones\" who gave $100 to\n      support an initiative. Rather, the issue is whether the cumulative effect\n      of disclosure ensures that the electorate will have access to information\n      regarding the driving forces backing and opposing each bill.\n\nNat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. McKee, 669 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir. 2012) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Family PAC, 2012 WL 266111, at *6 (\"[S]mall\ncontributions may provide useful information to voters when considered in the\naggregate.\").\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\f       Secondly, shareholders of corporations that engage in campaign-related speech\npossess a particular informational interest in disclosure. As partial owners of\ncorporations, these people have an important interest, both politically and from a\nbusiness perspective, in knowing about a corporation's campaign-related speech. See\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916. Disclosure allows shareholders to \"determine\nwhether their corporation's political speech advances the corporation's interest in\nmaking profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-\ncalled money interests.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, in the\nage of the internet, quick and full disclosure to shareholders is not only possible, but\nrelatively easy to accomplish. Id.\n\n        Third, disclosure prevents improper or suspect relationships between elected\nofficials and the persons or groups that support them. As the Supreme Court noted\nin Buckley, that \"exposure may discourage those who would use money for improper\npurposes either before or after the election. A public armed with information about\na candidate's most generous supporters is better able to detect any post-election special\nfavors that may be given in return.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67; see also L. Brandeis,\nOther People's Money 62 (National Home Library Foundation ed. 1933) (\"Publicity\nis justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said\nto be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.\").\n\n      Finally, \"and not least significant[ly],\" disclosure requirements serve an\nimportant \"means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations\" of campaign\nfinance laws. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67–68. This interest is particularly relevant to the\nMinnesota disclosure laws' requirements for an association to name a treasurer,\nsegregate its political funds, and conduct record-keeping. These requirements, which\nthe majority describes as \"only tangentially related to disclosure,\" supra at 17 n.9, help\nMinnesota ensure compliance with its disclosure laws. The ongoing reporting\nrequirement is also particularly relevant to this interest—it allows the state to easily\nmonitor compliance with its disclosure laws and obtain more complete information\n\n                                          -30-\n\fon political contributions and expenditures. This important interest is not out of\nproportion to the minimal burden the ongoing reporting requirement imposes on\nassociations.\n\n        Turning to the issue of those burdens, I would find that they are not nearly as\nheavy as the majority characterizes them to be. To comply with Minnesota's laws, a\ncorporation can appoint an employee or officer as treasurer of its political fund. The\nfund itself can be as simple as an internal bookkeeping device that separates and\ntracks contributions and expenditures. This internal bookkeeping option significantly\nlimits the cost of complying with Minnesota's regulations. Indeed, in a political fund's\nsimplest form, a treasurer acts as little more than a custodian of the records.\nMoreover, the information the Minnesota laws require to be disclosed about the\ncorporation's contributions and expenditures is similar to the disclosure requirements\nupheld in Citizens United. The federal law in that case required \"any person who\nspends more than $10,000 on electioneering communications within a calendar year\n[to] file a disclosure statement with the FEC. That statement must identify the person\nmaking the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which the\ncommunication was directed, and the names of certain contributors.\" Citizens United,\n130 S. Ct. at 914 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1), (2)).\n\n       The Minnesota legislature has chosen to impose these burdens not on everyone\nwho makes campaign-related expenditures, but rather, only on those who spend more\nthan $100 in one year. With regard to this decision of where to set reporting\nthresholds, \"we cannot require [the legislature] to establish that it has chosen the\nhighest reasonable threshold. The line is necessarily a judgmental decision, best left\nin the context of this complex legislation to [legislative] discretion.\" Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 83. As in Buckley, the $100 reporting threshold for the Minnesota disclosure\nlaws is not \"wholly without rationality.\" Id.; see also Planned Parenthood, 530 F.3d\nat 732 (\"'[G]overnmental policies implemented through legislation or regulations\ndeveloped through presumptively reasoned democratic processes are entitled to a\n\n                                         -31-\n\fhigher degree of deference and should not be enjoined lightly.'\" (quoting Able, 44\nF.3d at 131)). Accordingly, we should review these decisions with extreme deference,\nand require only that the legislature's choice be rational. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n82–83 (finding Congress's $10 threshold for reporting contributors' names and\naddresses and its $100 threshold for reporting contributors' names, addresses,\noccupations, and principal place of business not \"wholly without rationality\"); Family\nPAC, 2012 WL 266111, at *7 (affirming a $25 threshold for reporting contributors'\nnames and addresses and a $100 threshold for reporting names, addresses,\noccupations, and employers, and noting that \"disclosure thresholds, like contribution\nlimits, are inherently inexact; courts therefore owe substantial deference to legislative\njudgments fixing these amounts\"); Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. Daluz, 654 F.3d 115, 119\n(1st Cir. 2011) (finding Rhode Island's $100 reporting threshold not \"wholly without\nrationality\"); Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34, 60–61 (1st Cir. 2011)\n(affirming a $100 reporting threshold even though it was not indexed for inflation);\nDaggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics & Election Practices, 205 F.3d 445, 466\n(1st Cir. 2000) (finding a $50 reporting threshold not illegitimate). But see Sampson\nv. Buescher, 625 F.3d 1247, 1261 (10th Cir. 2010) (finding unconstitutional\nColorado's $20 threshold for reporting contributors' names and addresses and $100\nthreshold for reporting names, addresses, occupations, and employers because these\ncontributions \"are sufficiently small that they say little about the contributors' views\nof their financial interest in the annexation issue\"); Canyon Ferry Rd. Baptist Church\nof E. Helena, Inc. v. Unsworth, 556 F.3d 1021, 1033–34 (9th Cir. 2009) (finding\nMontana's \"zero dollar\" reporting threshold \"wholly without rationality\" because \"[a]s\na matter of common sense, the value of this financial information to the voters\ndeclines drastically as the value of the expenditure or contribution sinks to a negligible\nlevel. As the monetary value of an expenditure in support of a ballot issue approaches\nzero, financial sponsorship fades into support and then into mere sympathy\").\nMinnesota's $100 reporting threshold, based on the important state interests discussed\nabove, is not wholly without rationality.\n\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\f       The majority characterizes the requirements the Minnesota laws impose as\n\"onerous restrictions,\" supra at 12, predicting that they would \"manifestly discourage[]\nassociations, particularly small associations with limited resources, from engaging in\nprotected political speech. Supra at 14–15. In explaining why it views the disclosure\nrequirements to be so heavy, the majority points primarily to the ongoing reporting\nrequirement. It is true that associations must continue to make disclosures once they\nhave established a political fund and until they dissolve that fund. However, this\nburden is neither heavy nor out of proportion with the state's important interest in\ndisclosure. See SpeechNow.Org v. Fed. Elec. Comm'n, 599 F.3d 686, 696–98 (D.C.\nCir. 2010) (upholding 2 U.S.C. § 434(a)(4), which requires political committees to file\nquarterly reports, a pre-election report, and a post election report in election years; and\neither biannual or monthly reports during non-election years); see also Nat'l Org. for\nMarriage v. McKee, 649 F.3d 34, 58 (1st Cir. 2011) (noting that the upheld statute\nrequires \"reports both on a quarterly basis and shortly before or after each election,\"\nbut stating that plaintiff does not contest that the \"reporting requirements bear a\nsubstantial relation to Maine's informational interest\").\n\n       While I do not deny that the Minnesota laws impose some burden on\nassociations wishing to make political expenditures, that burden is not out of\nproportion with either the state's interest in the legislation or to other administrative\nburdens associations bear on a daily basis. Unlike the less forgiving strict scrutiny\nframework, exacting scrutiny analysis is designed precisely to allow courts to\nacknowledge burdens laws impose, and consider whether those burdens are\nsufficiently offset by state interests. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914 (applying\nexacting scrutiny because \"[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the\nability to speak, but the impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities and do not\nprevent anyone from speaking\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      The ongoing reporting requirement requires associations that make political\ncontributions to file five reports during a general election year (every other year in\n\n                                           -33-\n\fMinnesota) and one report during each year in which there is no election. Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.20, subdiv. 2. These reports must contain information about the political fund's\nliquid assets, contributions made to it, loans it made or received, expenditures it made,\nand disbursements it made during the reporting period. Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv.\n3. Importantly, if the political fund was inactive during the reporting period, it may\nsimply file a statement of inactivity, which comprises a one-page form, on which the\ntreasurer can check a box for inactivity. Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 7. Moreover,\nan association can easily create and dissolve a political fund, thereby allowing it to\nlimit its exposure to Minnesota's regulations to the time period in which it is actively\nengaging in political speech. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.14, 10A.24.\n\n       The majority acknowledges Minnesota can impose ongoing disclosure\nrequirements on corporations and associations that actually make contributions in a\nreporting period. See supra at 19. In the end, the majority's conclusion of a likely\nconstitutional violation solely centers on the reporting requirement for those\nassociations that choose not to terminate the fund but conduct no activity during the\nreporting period. Supra at 20. The majority concludes that filing a single-page form\nand checking one box once in non-election years and five times in an election year\nimposes an undue burden on speech. I respectfully disagree and do not believe\nMinnesota's check-the-box requirement rises to the level of a constitutional violation.\n\n       The majority attempts to illustrate the \"onerous\" burdens of the Minnesota\ndisclosure laws by considering a hypothetical case of two farmers who wish to erect\na sign to support a candidate for state office. As a preliminary matter, the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly cautioned against using hypothetical situations as a basis for\ndeciding a law's constitutionality: the \"power of pronouncing an Act of Congress\nunconstitutional\" is \"delicate,\" and it \"would indeed be undesirable for this Court to\nconsider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of\ncomplex and comprehensive legislation.\" United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21–22\n(1960) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Cnty. Court of Ulster Cnty., N.Y.\n\n                                          -34-\n\fv. Allen, 442 U.S. 140, 155 (1979) (\"As a general rule, if there is no constitutional\ndefect in the application of the statute to a litigant, he does not have standing to argue\nthat it would be unconstitutional if applied to third parties in hypothetical situations.\");\nTilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S. 672, 682 (1971) (plurality opinion) (\"We cannot . . .\nstrike down an Act of Congress on the basis of a hypothetical 'profile.'\"); United Pub.\nWorkers of Am. v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 89–90 (1947) (\"The power of courts, and\nultimately of this Court to pass upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress arises\nonly when the interests of litigants require the use of this judicial authority for their\nprotection against actual interference. A hypothetical threat is not enough.\");\nAnniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 337, 353 (1937) (\"Constitutional questions are\nnot to be decided hypothetically. When particular facts control the decision they must\nbe shown.\"). Because Minnesota Citizens does not bring an overbreadth challenge\nhere, we should not consider the effects of the Minnesota disclosure laws on third\nparties. See Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466\nU.S. 789, 798 (1984) (\"[T]he very existence of some broadly written statutes may\nhave such a deterrent effect on free expression that they should be subject to challenge\neven by a party whose own conduct may be unprotected.\").\n\n       Even considering the majority's hypothetical situation as an example, it is clear\nthat the burdens of Minnesota's disclosure laws are far from heavy. It is worth noting\nat the outset that these requirements would hardly be onerous for our hypothetical\nfarmers. The majority's hypothetical seems to assume that the farmers are\nunsophisticated business people, inexperienced in filling out forms and interacting\nwith the bureaucracy of government. However, even the smallest business regularly\nfiles government forms and reports that are significantly more complicated and\nburdensome than the requirements of Minnesota's disclosures laws. I make this point\nnot to argue that any burden less than that of filing taxes or employment forms is\nconstitutional, but to point out that we should not consider the burdens the Minnesota\nlaws impose in a vacuum. Moreover, while I acknowledge the majority's assertion\nthat the Minnesota laws require associations to choose whether to comply with the\n\n                                           -35-\n\fdisclosure requirements or refrain from protected First Amendment activity, see supra\nat 15, I do not believe this fact automatically makes the laws likely to be found\nunconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme Court has, on several occasions, upheld\nregulations that condition constitutionally protected conduct on compliance with\nregulatory requirements. See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788 (1983)\n(noting that although \"rights of voters are fundamental,\" states may enact\n\"comprehensive and sometimes complex election codes\" that \"govern the registration\nand qualification of voters, the selection and eligibility of candidates, or the voting\nprocess itself,\" even though these regulations \"inevitably affect[]—at least to some\ndegree—the individual's right to vote and his right to associate with others for political\nends\"); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U.S. 569, 576 (1941) (upholding a state statute\nrequiring licenses for parades and processions and finding \"it impossible to say that\nthe limited authority conferred by the licensing provisions of the statute in question\nas thus construed by the state court contravened any constitutional right\").\n\n       Under the Minnesota laws, the farmers would file a statement of registration\nwithin fourteen days of their initial expenditure. For these two farmers, the report\nwould contain minimal information—likely only the source of the contributions that\npaid for the sign, the expenditures made for the sign, and the names and addresses of\nthe association's members—the two farmers. After this initial report, the farmers\nwould, as the majority notes, be subject to ongoing reporting requirements. They\nwould be required to file a total of five reports during election years and one report\nduring non-election years. These reports would contain information on any further\npolitical activity undertaken by the farmers' association. If, as the majority's\nhypothetical situation indicates, the farmers did not make further expenditures after\ntheir initial expenditure on the sign, these reports would simply be a statement of\ninactivity—their reporting requirements would consist solely of checking one box on\na one-page form.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f      If the farmers wished to escape this ongoing reporting requirement, this too\nwould be an option for them under the Minnesota disclosure laws. The farmers could\nchoose to dissolve their association by settling debts, disposing of remaining assets\nin excess of $100, and filing a termination report. Minn. Stat. § 10A.24, subdiv. 1.\nFor these two farmers, settling debts and returning contributions would likely be a\nnon-existent or minimal burden, as their activity—paying for and constructing a\nsign—was also slight.\n\n       Thus, Minnesota's disclosure laws do not subject associations to \"the full\npanoply of regulations that accompany status as a [federal PAC],\" as the majority\nargues. See supra at 16. This is true notwithstanding the majority's observation that\n\"Minnesota's law imposes virtually identical regulatory burdens on political funds as\nit does political committees.\" Supra at 11. As the First Circuit has noted, \"[i]t is not\nthe designation as a PAC but rather the obligations that attend PAC designation that\nmatter for purposes of First Amendment review.\" Nat'l Org. for Marriage v. McKee,\n649 F.3d 34, 56 (1st Cir. 2011). Here, where Minnesota's disclosure laws subject its\nPACs and political funds to requirements that are less burdensome than those of\nfederal PACs, the fact that political funds and PACs are subject to similar\nrequirements is insignificant.\n\n       Minnesota's interests in its disclosure laws are important and substantial. And\nwhile the laws undeniably impose some burdens on associations in Minnesota that\nengage in campaign-related speech, these burdens are not heavy and are substantially\nrelated to the government's disclosure interests. Under exacting scrutiny, the mere\nexistence of burdens on campaign-related speech is insufficient to render a restriction\nunconstitutional. Rather, for a court to find a restriction unconstitutional under\nexacting scrutiny, those burdens must lack a substantial relation to the government's\ninterest in that regulation. Davis, 554 U.S. at 744. Here, this is simply not the case.\nThus, I would hold that the Minnesota laws meet the requirements of exacting scrutiny\nand are likely to be constitutional disclosure requirements.\n\n                                         -37-\n\fCOLLOTON, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n       I join Part II.C of the opinion of the court, and I concur in Judge Melloy’s\nopinion regarding disclosure requirements, except for the paragraph beginning\n“Third,” on page 30. In my view, that paragraph’s reliance on a state interest in\ndeterring “improper or suspect relationships” between elected officials and supporters\nwho make independent expenditures is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s holding\nthat “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise\nto corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United v. Fed. Elec. Comm’n,\n130 S. Ct. 876, 909 (2010). As the D.C. Circuit explained, however, “[b]ecause\ndisclosure requirements inhibit speech less than do contribution and expenditure\nlimits, the Supreme Court has not limited the government’s acceptable interests to\nanti-corruption alone.” SpeechNow.org v. Fed. Elec. Comm’n, 599 F.3d 686, 696\n(D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc). The other interests invoked by the State are sufficiently\nimportant to justify the disclosure requirements at issue here.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\f",

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       The appellants originally named as defendants the Minnesota Attorney\nGeneral, six members of the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board (Board), eight\nadministrative law judges of the Office of Administrative Hearings, and the Hennepin\nCounty Attorney. On March 1, 2011, the district court granted the administrative law\njudges’ and the Minnesota Attorney General’s motions to dismiss with prejudice,\nleaving only the Board members and the Hennepin County Attorney as defendants.\nThe dismissal is not at issue on this appeal.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fI.     BACKGROUND\n       The appellants are Minnesota business entities. Minnesota Citizens and\nTaxpayers League are nonprofit corporations and claim to be tax exempt under 26\nU.S.C. § 501(c)(4), which requires they be “primarily engaged in promoting in some\nway the common good and general welfare of the people of the community,” not to\ninclude “direct or indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns on\nbehalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public office.” 26 C.F.R. § 1.501(c)(4)-\n1(a)(2). Coastal Travel is a for-profit Minnesota limited liability company in the\ntravel services industry.\n\n        The appellants challenge certain provisions of Minnesota’s campaign finance\nlaws, claiming the provisions violate their free speech and association rights under the\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as their equal protection rights under the\nFourteenth Amendment. Specifically, the appellants claim Minnesota’s law\nimpermissibly violates their rights to make (1) contributions to candidates and\npolitical parties, and (2) independent expenditures advocating the election or defeat\nof a candidate.\n\n       The challenged provisions are part of Minnesota’s Campaign Finance and\nPublic Disclosure law, see Minn. Stat. § 10A.01 et seq., and Fair Campaign Practices\nlaw, see Minn. Stat. § 211B.01 et seq. These laws were amended in 2010, see 2010\nMinn. Sess. Law Serv. ch. 397, at 2001-08, after the Supreme Court held “the\n[g]overnment may not suppress political speech on the basis of the speaker’s corporate\nidentity” whether by “nonprofit or for-profit corporations,” Citizens United v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 870-73\n(D. Minn. 2010).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       Minnesota prohibits corporations and limited liability companies from directly\nor indirectly contributing “to a major political party, organization, committee, or\nindividual to promote or defeat the candidacy of an individual for nomination,\nelection, or appointment to a political office.” Minn. Stat. § 211B.15, subdivs. 1 and 2.\nCorporations and limited liability companies may, however, make an independent\nexpenditure, see id. at subdivs. 2 and 3, defined as “an expenditure expressly\nadvocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, if the expenditure\nis made without the express or implied consent, authorization, or cooperation of, and\nnot in concert with or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate or any candidate’s\nprincipal campaign committee or agent.” Minn. Stat. § 10A.01, subdiv. 18.\n\n       Minnesota’s law provides two options for corporations and limited liability\ncompanies to participate in making independent expenditures. See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. Both options require compliance with certain organizational,\nrecord-keeping, and reporting requirements. Importantly, these laws reach not just\ncorporations and limited liability companies, but nearly all associations, see Minn.\nStat. § 10A.12, subdiv. 1a, regulating even the smallest partnership. See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.01, subdiv. 6 (“‘Association’ means a group of two or more persons, who are\nnot all members of an immediate family, acting in concert.”).\n\n      First, an association may indirectly make an independent expenditure “by\ncontributing to an existing independent expenditure political committee or political\nfund.” Id. An independent expenditure political committee—commonly referred to\nas a PAC—is an association, other than a principal campaign committee or political\nparty unit, “whose major purpose is to influence the nomination or election of a\ncandidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,” Minn. Stat. § 10A.01, subdiv. 27,\nand that only makes independent expenditures and other specified permissible\ndisbursements. See Minn Stat. § 10A.01, subdivs. 18a and 27; Minn. Stat. § 10A.121,\nsubdiv. 1. An independent expenditure political fund is “an accumulation of dues or\nvoluntary contributions by an association . . . collected or expended to influence the\n\n                                          -4-\n\fnomination or election of a candidate or to promote or defeat a ballot question,” Minn.\nStat. § 10A.01, subdiv. 28, exclusively used to make independent expenditures and\nstatutorily-specified related expenses. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10.A.01, subdiv. 18b;\n10A.121, subdiv. 1.\n\n       The Board is responsible for administrating and enforcing Minnesota’s\ndisclosure laws and has the power to audit and investigate compliance issues. See\nMinn. Stat. § 10A.02. According to the affidavit of Gary Goldsmith, the executive\ndirector of the Board, a business corporation contributing its own money to an existing\nindependent expenditure political committee or fund typically would have to disclose\nonly its name and address to the recipient fund. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.27, subdivs.\n13 and 14. Goldsmith further explained a non-profit corporation that has donated\n$5,000 or more to independent expenditure political committees or funds must\ndisclose additional information related to the underlying source of the money.2 Id.\nat subdiv. 15.\n\n       For an association directly to make an independent expenditure, it must create\nand register its own independent expenditure political fund (political fund). See Minn.\nStat. § 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. Once an association forms a political fund, it must elect\nor appoint a treasurer and ensure the contents of the fund are not commingled with\nother funds. See id. subdivs. 2 and 3. According to Goldsmith, a political fund is\nsimply an “account,” and unless the association accepts contributions from others, it\nneed not use a separate “bank or depository account.” Instead, the association may\ntrack the funds used for independent expenditures using “an internal bookkeeping\ndevice, or something as simple as a spreadsheet.”\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       We offer no opinion as to whether Goldsmith’s explanation is an accurate\ninterpretation of Minnesota law.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f       The treasurer must register the political fund “by filing a statement of\norganization” with the Board. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.14, subdiv. 1. This filing must\noccur “no later than 14 days after the . . . [political] fund . . . has made a contribution,\nreceived contributions, or made expenditures in excess of $100.”3 Id. The filing must\ninclude the contact information for the association, the political fund, and the\ntreasurer, as well as a list of all depositories or safe deposit boxes used. See id. at\nsubdiv. 2.\n\n       For the life of the political fund, the treasurer must file annual reports detailing\nthe political fund’s activity. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 2. During general\nelection years—which occur every other year—the treasurer must file four additional\nreports; twenty-eight and fifteen days before a primary, and forty-two and ten days\nbefore a general election. See id. As the district court explained,\n\n       The report must disclose the amount of liquid assets at the beginning of\n       a reporting period; the name and address of each individual or\n       association whose contributions within the year exceed $100; the amount\n       and date of such contributions; the sum of contributions during the\n       reporting period; each loan made or received that exceeds $100; the\n       name and address of the lender; receipts over $100 during the reporting\n       period not otherwise listed; the sum of those receipts; the name and\n       address of each individual or association to whom the reporting entity\n       made expenditures within the year exceeding $100; the sum of all\n       expenditures made by the reporting entity during the reporting period;\n       the name and address of each political committee, political fund,\n       principal campaign committee, or party unit to which contributions in\n       excess of $100 were made; the sum of all contributions; the amount and\n       nature of any advance of credit incurred; the name and address of each\n       individual or association to whom noncampaign disbursements have\n\n       3\n       If the political fund receives from any one source either a loan or a contribution\nexceeding certain designated amounts (typically $1,000), the treasurer must register\nthe political fund by the end of the next business day. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.14,\nsubdiv. 1; 10A.20, subdiv. 5.\n\n                                            -6-\n\f      been made that aggregate in excess of $100 and the purpose of each\n      noncampaign disbursement; the sum of all noncampaign disbursements;\n      and the name and address of a nonprofit corporation that provides\n      administrative assistance to the political committee or political fund.\n\nMinn.

See Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.12, subdiv. 1a. But this option does not allow the association itself to speak.\nInstead it only allows the association to assist another entity in speaking.

The regulatory requirements\nof an individual end as soon as he or she discloses a qualifying independent\nexpenditure to the Board, see Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 6, but a corporation or\nother association must continue to comply with these burdensome regulations even\nafter it stops speaking.\n\n      Minnesota’s law imposes virtually identical regulatory burdens upon political\nfunds as it does political committees. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.11, 10A.12, 10A.121,\n10A.13, 10A.14, 10A.15, 10A.17, 10A.20, 10A.24. This equality of burdens is\nmeaningful in view of past judicial efforts to ensure laws imposing PAC status and\naccompanying burdens are limited in their reach.\n\n       In Buckley, for example, the Supreme Court narrowly construed the federal\ndefinition of a PAC, see Buckley 424 U.S. at 74-80, to “only encompass organizations\nthat are under the control of a candidate or the major purpose of which is the\nnomination or election of a candidate.” Id. at 79. The Supreme Court reasoned this\nnarrow interpretation ensured the scope of the law was not “impermissibly broad.”\nSee id. at 79-80.

May 17, 2012) (unpublished per curiam). By subjecting political funds to the\nsame regulatory burdens as PACs, Minnesota has, in effect, substantially extended the\nreach of PAC-like regulation to all associations that ever make independent\nexpenditures.\n\n      The Supreme Court has recognized forcing a corporation to speak through a\nPAC creates “First Amendment problems” because of the associated regulatory\nburdens. See Citizens United, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897; see also N.C. Right\nto Life, Inc., 525 F.3d at 296 (“[T]he Constitution makes clear that excessive\nregulation of political speech is suspect.”). In Citizens United, the Supreme Court\ncharacterized PACs as “burdensome alternatives” to direct corporate speech because\n“they are expensive to administer and subject to extensive regulations.” Citizens\nUnited, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897. The Supreme Court highlighted\nrequirements substantially similar to those Minnesota imposes upon political funds.\n  See id. The Court surmised these “onerous restrictions” likely stop many\ncorporations from speaking through PACs. See id. at___, 130 S. Ct. at 897-98. We\nsurmise the same is true of Minnesota’s expansive regulation of political funds.\n\n      Perhaps most onerous is the ongoing reporting requirement. Once initiated, the\nrequirement is potentially perpetual regardless of whether the association ever again\nmakes an independent expenditure. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdivs. 2 and 7\n\n                                        -12-\n\f(requiring political funds to file five reports during a general election year, even if the\npolitical fund has been inactive during that period). The reporting requirements\napparently end only if the association dissolves the political fund. See id.; Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.24, subdiv. 1. To dissolve the political fund, the association must first settle\nthe political fund’s debts, dispose of its assets valued in excess of $100—including\nphysical assets and credit balances—and file a termination report with the Board.7 See\nid. Of course, the association’s constitutional right to speak through independent\nexpenditures dissolves with the political fund. To speak again, the association must\ninitiate the bureaucratic process again.\n\n       Under Minnesota’s regulatory regime, an association is compelled to decide\nwhether exercising its constitutional right is worth the time and expense of entering\na long-term morass of regulatory red tape. Suppose two Minnesota farmers owning\nadjoining property near a highway support a particular candidate for state office. The\nfarmers decide to erect a large sign in support of the candidate and spend over $100\nin supplies and labor. To comply with Minnesota’s law, the farmers must create and\nregister a political fund, appoint a treasurer, keep detailed records, and file ongoing\nreports with the Board. The farmers must continue to file even if the farmers do not\ncontinue to “speak.” To escape these ongoing burdens, the farmers must file a\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       Upon notice to an association, Minnesota’s Board may force dissolution of an\n“inactive” political fund if “two years have elapsed since the end of a reporting period\nduring which the political . . . fund made an expenditure or disbursement requiring\ndisclosure under [the Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Act].” Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.242, subdivs. 1 and 2. Until the Board provides such notice, an association\npresumably must continue to file reports on its inactive political fund. The statute is\nunclear as to what mechanism triggers the process of dissolving inactive political\nfunds. Regardless, an association wishing to retain its First Amendment right to make\nindependent expenditures must continue reporting on an ongoing basis.\n\n                                           -13-\n\ftermination statement. Before they can do that, they must dispose of the political\nfund’s assets—including the sign.8 If the farmers forget to file, or assume continued\nreporting is unnecessary, they are subject to significant fines and possible\nimprisonment.\n\n      Faced with these regulatory burdens—or even just the daunting task of\ndeciphering what is required under the law, see N.C. Right to Life, Inc., 525 F.3d at\n296 (noting campaign finance regulation has become “an area in which speakers are\nnow increasingly forced to navigate a maze of rules, sub-rules, and cross-references\nin order to do nothing more than project a basic political message”)—the farmers\nreasonably could decide the exercise is simply not worth the trouble. See MCFL, 479\nU.S. at 255 (plurality opinion) (“Faced with the need to assume a more sophisticated\norganizational form, to adopt specific accounting procedures, to file periodic detailed\nreports . . . it would not be surprising if at least some groups decided that the\ncontemplated political activity was simply not worth it.”). And who would blame\nthem?\n\n      Minnesota’s law hinders associations from participating in the political debate\nand limits their access to the citizenry and the government. The law manifestly\ndiscourages associations, particularly small associations with limited resources, from\n\n\n      8\n        At oral argument, Minnesota claimed the hypothetical farmers could terminate\nthe political fund at the same time they registered the fund. When pressed on the issue\nof whether the farmers would have to get rid of the sign before terminating, Minnesota\nclaimed the Board does not interpret the statute to require associations such as the\nfarmers to dispose of all physical assets before terminating the fund. But the statute\nsays otherwise. See Minn. Stat. § 10A.24, subdiv. 1 (“‘Assets’ include . . . physical\nassets.”). We do not expect potentially regulated associations to rely on Minnesota’s\ninformal assurance that it would not enforce the plain meaning of the statute.\n“Unguided regulatory discretion and the potential for regulatory abuse are the very\nburdens to which political speech must never be subject.” N.C. Right to Life, Inc.,\n525 F.3d at 290.\n\n                                         -14-\n\fengaging in protected political speech.

In short, the collective burdens\nassociated with Minnesota’s independent expenditure law chill political speech.\n\n      This chill is more than a theoretical concern. All three appellants—two\nnonprofit issue advocacy groups and one for-profit travel-services provider—claim\nto have abandoned planned independent expenditures in order to avoid the\naccompanying regulatory burdens. If true, Minnesota’s law has “interfere[d] with the\n‘open marketplace’ of ideas protected by the First Amendment.” Citizens United, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 906.\n\n       The dissent minimizes this concern, stating “even the smallest business\nregularly files government forms and reports that are significantly more complicated\nand burdensome than the requirements of Minnesota’s disclosure laws.” Post at 35.\nWe disagree with such broad, unsupported conjecture, but assuming the statement is\ntrue, it misses the point. Most associations—no matter the size—are capable, for\nexample, of assembling and completing the paperwork necessary to file tax returns.\nBut such paperwork is not a burden interfering with the constitutionally protected\nmarketplace of ideas. Unlike compliance with the mandatory tax laws, the laws at\nissue here give Minnesota associations a choice—either comply with cumbersome\nongoing regulatory burdens or sacrifice protected core First Amendment activity.\nThis is a particularly difficult choice for smaller businesses and associations for whom\npolitical speech is not a major purpose nor a frequent activity. Such a disincentive for\n\n                                         -15-\n\fpolitical speech demands our attention.

Contribution Ban\n       We next address the appellants’ challenge to Minnesota’s prohibition against\ncorporate political contributions. See Minn. Stat. § 211B.15, subdiv. 2. The\nappellants contend the district court erred in denying its motion for a preliminary\ninjunction against Minnesota’s ban on such contributions because it violates their\nrights of speech and association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\nas well as their equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. We detect\nno abuse of discretion.\n\n       We first address the appellants’ First Amendment argument. The appellants\nargue they are likely to enjoy merits success on their free speech and association claim\nagainst the contribution ban because Minnesota’s law conflicts with Citizens United’s\ninstruction that outright bans on political speech are impermissible. See Citizens\nUnited, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 913. We disagree.\n\n      The crux of appellants’ argument is advanced under the following reasoning.\nContributing to a political campaign is a form of political speech, as well as\nassociation. See, e.g., Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20-21 (“A contribution serves as a general\nexpression of support for the candidate and his views.”). Constitutionally, a\ncorporation cannot be required to speak through a PAC. See Citizens United, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 897 (reasoning a PAC exemption to a prohibition against\ncorporate independent expenditures “does not allow [a] corporation[] to speak”\nbecause “[a] PAC is a separate association from the corporation”). Under Minnesota’s\nlaw, the only means for corporations to contribute to a political candidate or\ncommittee is through an “[e]mployee political fund,” see Minn. Stat. § 211B.15,\nsubdiv. 16, which the appellants claim is a PAC. Therefore, Minnesota’s law bans\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fcorporate political speech, a result that is contrary to the holding in Citizens United,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">at ___, 130 S. Ct. at 911.\n\n       The appellants’ syllogism fails to recognize the significant distinction the\nSupreme Court made in its review of laws restricting independent expenditures and\nlaws restricting contributions. Put simply, “restrictions on contributions require less\ncompelling justification than restrictions on independent spending.” FEC v.\nBeaumont, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130151\"><a href=\"/opinion/130151/federal-election-commn-v-beaumont/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 158-59 (2003) (quoting MCFL, 479 U.S. at 259-60))\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court deemed “restrictions on\npolitical contributions . . . as merely ‘marginal’ speech restrictions subject to relatively\ncomplaisant review under the First Amendment, because contributions lie closer to the\nedges than to the core of political expression.” Id. at 161.

CONCLUSION\n       We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the district court for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nMELLOY, Circuit Judge, with whom MURPHY, BYE and SMITH, Circuit Judges,\njoin, concurring and dissenting.\n\n       I concur in Section II.C. of the majority opinion. I agree that Minnesota's ban\non corporate political contributions is likely constitutional. However, I dissent as to\nthe analysis of Minnesota's reporting requirements. I believe the majority fails to fully\napply the holding of Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 913–14. Citizens United\nextensively discussed and relied upon two fundamental principles. First, corporations\nhave a First Amendment right to speak through political contributions, id., 130 S. Ct.\nat 913, and second, the voting public has a right to know where the money is coming\nfrom, id. at 914. In my view, the majority gives short shrift to this second\nfundamental principle of Citizens United. Failure to honor this important public\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\finterest leads it to hold that the carefully crafted Minnesota disclosure legislation is\nlikely to be unconstitutional.\n\n       I would first note that the majority opinion cites, but fails to apply, our\ncontrolling precedent on the standard to be applied in enjoining a duly enacted state\nstatute. The majority cites the standard we articulated in Planned Parenthood of\nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota v. Rounds, that to succeed on a preliminary\ninjunction, a party must show that it \"is likely to prevail on the merits.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189321\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189321/planned-parent-mn-n-dakota-s-dakota-v-rounds/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n730 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc). However, in my view, the majority ignores the reason\nwe require this more rigorous standard \"where a preliminary injunction of a duly\nenacted state statute is sought.\" Id. at 730. In imposing a higher standard in these\ncases, we seek to \"'reflect[] the idea that governmental policies implemented through\nlegislation or regulations developed through presumptively reasoned democratic\nprocesses are entitled to a higher degree of deference and should not be enjoined\nlightly.'\" Id. at 732 (quoting Able v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 (2d Cir. 1995)\n(per curiam)). In my view, that is particularly true in cases such as this where we\nconsider whether to enjoin a statute in which the state legislature exercised its\nlegislative function of \"line drawing.\" Instead of deferring to the legislature, the\nmajority would instead impose its own judgment to determine that a $100 threshold\nfor requiring reporting is too low, that five disclosure reports in an election year are\ntoo many, and that the administrative costs of keeping records in accordance with the\nlaw are too high. These issues are typically and best left to Minnesota's\ndemocratically elected legislators.\n\n       Applying the Planned Parenthood standard, I would find Minnesota's disclosure\nlaws likely to be constitutional. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court held that\ncourts should consider disclosure requirements under the exacting scrutiny framework\nbecause those laws do not suppress speech by \"'impos[ing a] ceiling on campaign-\nrelated activities' [or] 'prevent[ing] anyone from speaking.'\" Citizens United, 130 S.\nCt. at 914 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64 (1976) and McConnell v.

I agree with the majority that a\ndisclosure law might suppress speech and thus trigger strict scrutiny if it directly\nimposed limitations on speech, such as by requiring an association to speak through\na PAC or by limiting contributions or expenditures above a certain amount. However,\nI disagree with the majority's suggestion that strict scrutiny might apply to a law that\ndoes not directly limit speech simply because the burdens the law imposes are viewed\nas heavy enough to be an indirect limit. Subjecting disclosure laws to this type of\nanalysis is circular and conclusory; it requires a court to assess the burden of a\ndisclosure law to determine what level of scrutiny applies, then to evaluate that burden\nagain under exacting or strict scrutiny. This analysis also leads the majority to\nunderestimate the states' interests in disclosure laws and overestimate the burdens\nthose laws impose on speech. It is sufficient to consider the burdens disclosure laws\nimpose once, in the course of the exacting scrutiny analysis the Supreme Court has\nindicated is appropriate. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914.\n\n       The Minnesota disclosure laws do not directly suppress speech, and so exacting\nscrutiny is the appropriate framework for considering their constitutionality. The\nMinnesota laws neither prevent an association from speaking for itself, nor do they\nimpose any limit on the amount of speech in which an association can engage. First,\nthe laws do not require an association to speak through another entity to engage in\ncampaign-related speech. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court found such a\nrequirement particularly troubling because allowing a corporation to speak only\nthrough a separate association \"does not allow corporations to speak\" at all. Citizens\nUnited, 130 S. Ct. at 897. In contrast, under the Minnesota laws, a corporation does\nnot need to be a separate association from the political fund it establishes. Rather, it\ncan retain full control over the operations of a political fund it creates, including by\nappointing a corporate employee or officer as the fund's treasurer and by directing the\npolitical fund to return any excess contributions and dissolve. Thus, the Minnesota\nlaws avoid the constitutional infirmity the Supreme Court addressed in Citizens\nUnited. Secondly, unlike the PACs the Supreme Court considered in Citizens United,\n\n                                         -27-\n\funder the Minnesota laws a corporation can contribute an unlimited amount directly\nto its political fund, and the political fund can use these contributions to make\nexpenditures. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 887–88. This contrasts with the\nrestrictions the Court confronted in Citizens United, under which corporations could\nonly use \"donations from stockholders and employees of the corporation\" for express\nadvocacy or electioneering communications. Id. at 888.\n\n       Under the exacting scrutiny framework, disclosure laws survive if the\ngovernment shows \"a relevant correlation or substantial relation between the\ngovernmental interest and the information required to be disclosed.\" Davis v. Fed.\nElection Comm'n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">554</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">724, 744 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In\nother words, \"the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of\nthe actual burden on First Amendment rights.\" Id. I would hold that Minnesota's\ndisclosure laws meet this test and are likely to be constitutional.\n\n       Although Minnesota has pointed to several important state interests that its\ndisclosure laws serve, the majority opinion provides little discussion of these interests,\nother than to note they exist. See supra at 19. In my view, this apparent discounting\nof the state's interests and the resulting focus almost solely on the burdens the laws\nimpose presents an unbalanced and flawed application of the exacting scrutiny\nanalysis.\n\n       First, and most importantly, the state has an important interest in providing the\nvoting public with information about which associations and corporations support\nparticular issues and candidates. This is an interest that the Supreme Court has time\nand again found to be important. See, e.g., Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914\n(\"[D]isclosure could be justified based on a governmental interest in providing the\nelectorate with information about the sources of election-related spending.\" (internal\nmarks and alterations omitted)); McConnell, 540 U.S. at 196 (\"providing the\nelectorate with information\" is an important state interest); Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n\n                                          -28-\n\f66–67 (\"[D]isclosure provides the electorate with information as to where political\ncampaign money comes from and how it is spent by the candidate in order to aid the\nvoters in evaluating those who seek federal office. It allows voters to place each\ncandidate in the political spectrum more precisely than is often possible solely on the\nbasis of party labels and campaign speeches.\" (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted)). In elections, it is important for voters to hear directly from candidates and\ncampaigns about their views on the issues. However, it is also important for voters\nto know which groups support or oppose a candidate or initiative; this information\nallows voters to better understand the political and practical ramifications of a ballot\nissue or the election of a candidate. As the Ninth Circuit explained, \"[k]nowing which\ninterested parties back or oppose a ballot measure is critical, especially when one\nconsiders that ballot-measure language is typically confusing, and the long-term\npolicy ramifications of the ballot measure are often unknown.\" Family PAC v.\nMcKenna, --- F.3d ---, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">266111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (9th Cir. Jan. 31, 2012) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n      Our sister circuits have found this informational interest important even with\nrespect to smaller expenditures:\n\n      The public has an interest in knowing [] that a ballot measure has been\n      supported by a multitude of gifts, even small gifts, from a particular state\n      or from a specific profession. . . . The issue is thus not whether voters\n      clamor for information about each \"Hank Jones\" who gave $100 to\n      support an initiative. Rather, the issue is whether the cumulative effect\n      of disclosure ensures that the electorate will have access to information\n      regarding the driving forces backing and opposing each bill.\n\nNat'l Org. for Marriage, Inc. v. McKee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2012) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also Family PAC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">266111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *6 (\"[S]mall\ncontributions may provide useful information to voters when considered in the\naggregate.\").\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\f       Secondly, shareholders of corporations that engage in campaign-related speech\npossess a particular informational interest in disclosure. As partial owners of\ncorporations, these people have an important interest, both politically and from a\nbusiness perspective, in knowing about a corporation's campaign-related speech. See\nCitizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 916. Disclosure allows shareholders to \"determine\nwhether their corporation's political speech advances the corporation's interest in\nmaking profits, and citizens can see whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-\ncalled money interests.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, in the\nage of the internet, quick and full disclosure to shareholders is not only possible, but\nrelatively easy to accomplish. Id.\n\n        Third, disclosure prevents improper or suspect relationships between elected\nofficials and the persons or groups that support them. As the Supreme Court noted\nin Buckley, that \"exposure may discourage those who would use money for improper\npurposes either before or after the election. A public armed with information about\na candidate's most generous supporters is better able to detect any post-election special\nfavors that may be given in return.\" Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67; see also L. Brandeis,\nOther People's Money 62 (National Home Library Foundation ed. 1933) (\"Publicity\nis justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said\nto be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.\").\n\n      Finally, \"and not least significant[ly],\" disclosure requirements serve an\nimportant \"means of gathering the data necessary to detect violations\" of campaign\nfinance laws. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 67–68. This interest is particularly relevant to the\nMinnesota disclosure laws' requirements for an association to name a treasurer,\nsegregate its political funds, and conduct record-keeping. These requirements, which\nthe majority describes as \"only tangentially related to disclosure,\" supra at 17 n.9, help\nMinnesota ensure compliance with its disclosure laws. The ongoing reporting\nrequirement is also particularly relevant to this interest—it allows the state to easily\nmonitor compliance with its disclosure laws and obtain more complete information\n\n                                          -30-\n\fon political contributions and expenditures. This important interest is not out of\nproportion to the minimal burden the ongoing reporting requirement imposes on\nassociations.\n\n        Turning to the issue of those burdens, I would find that they are not nearly as\nheavy as the majority characterizes them to be. To comply with Minnesota's laws, a\ncorporation can appoint an employee or officer as treasurer of its political fund. The\nfund itself can be as simple as an internal bookkeeping device that separates and\ntracks contributions and expenditures. This internal bookkeeping option significantly\nlimits the cost of complying with Minnesota's regulations. Indeed, in a political fund's\nsimplest form, a treasurer acts as little more than a custodian of the records.\nMoreover, the information the Minnesota laws require to be disclosed about the\ncorporation's contributions and expenditures is similar to the disclosure requirements\nupheld in Citizens United. The federal law in that case required \"any person who\nspends more than $10,000 on electioneering communications within a calendar year\n[to] file a disclosure statement with the FEC. That statement must identify the person\nmaking the expenditure, the amount of the expenditure, the election to which the\ncommunication was directed, and the names of certain contributors.\" Citizens United,\n130 S. Ct. at 914 (citing 2 U.S.C. § 434(f)(1), (2)).\n\n       The Minnesota legislature has chosen to impose these burdens not on everyone\nwho makes campaign-related expenditures, but rather, only on those who spend more\nthan $100 in one year. With regard to this decision of where to set reporting\nthresholds, \"we cannot require [the legislature] to establish that it has chosen the\nhighest reasonable threshold. The line is necessarily a judgmental decision, best left\nin the context of this complex legislation to [legislative] discretion.\" Buckley, 424\nU.S. at 83. As in Buckley, the $100 reporting threshold for the Minnesota disclosure\nlaws is not \"wholly without rationality.\" Id.; see also Planned Parenthood, 530 F.3d\nat 732 (\"'[G]overnmental policies implemented through legislation or regulations\ndeveloped through presumptively reasoned democratic processes are entitled to a\n\n                                         -31-\n\fhigher degree of deference and should not be enjoined lightly.'\" (quoting Able, 44\nF.3d at 131)). Accordingly, we should review these decisions with extreme deference,\nand require only that the legislature's choice be rational. See Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n82–83 (finding Congress's $10 threshold for reporting contributors' names and\naddresses and its $100 threshold for reporting contributors' names, addresses,\noccupations, and principal place of business not \"wholly without rationality\"); Family\nPAC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">266111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (affirming a $25 threshold for reporting contributors'\nnames and addresses and a $100 threshold for reporting names, addresses,\noccupations, and employers, and noting that \"disclosure thresholds, like contribution\nlimits, are inherently inexact; courts therefore owe substantial deference to legislative\njudgments fixing these amounts\"); Nat'l Org. for Marriage v.

Supra at 14–15. In explaining why it views the disclosure\nrequirements to be so heavy, the majority points primarily to the ongoing reporting\nrequirement. It is true that associations must continue to make disclosures once they\nhave established a political fund and until they dissolve that fund. However, this\nburden is neither heavy nor out of proportion with the state's important interest in\ndisclosure. See SpeechNow.Org v. Fed. Elec.

Unlike the less forgiving strict scrutiny\nframework, exacting scrutiny analysis is designed precisely to allow courts to\nacknowledge burdens laws impose, and consider whether those burdens are\nsufficiently offset by state interests. See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 914 (applying\nexacting scrutiny because \"[d]isclaimer and disclosure requirements may burden the\nability to speak, but the impose no ceiling on campaign-related activities and do not\nprevent anyone from speaking\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n      The ongoing reporting requirement requires associations that make political\ncontributions to file five reports during a general election year (every other year in\n\n                                           -33-\n\fMinnesota) and one report during each year in which there is no election. Minn. Stat.\n§ 10A.20, subdiv. 2. These reports must contain information about the political fund's\nliquid assets, contributions made to it, loans it made or received, expenditures it made,\nand disbursements it made during the reporting period. Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv.\n3. Importantly, if the political fund was inactive during the reporting period, it may\nsimply file a statement of inactivity, which comprises a one-page form, on which the\ntreasurer can check a box for inactivity. Minn. Stat. § 10A.20, subdiv. 7. Moreover,\nan association can easily create and dissolve a political fund, thereby allowing it to\nlimit its exposure to Minnesota's regulations to the time period in which it is actively\nengaging in political speech. See Minn. Stat. §§ 10A.14, 10A.24.\n\n       The majority acknowledges Minnesota can impose ongoing disclosure\nrequirements on corporations and associations that actually make contributions in a\nreporting period. See supra at 19. In the end, the majority's conclusion of a likely\nconstitutional violation solely centers on the reporting requirement for those\nassociations that choose not to terminate the fund but conduct no activity during the\nreporting period. Supra at 20. The majority concludes that filing a single-page form\nand checking one box once in non-election years and five times in an election year\nimposes an undue burden on speech. I respectfully disagree and do not believe\nMinnesota's check-the-box requirement rises to the level of a constitutional violation.\n\n       The majority attempts to illustrate the \"onerous\" burdens of the Minnesota\ndisclosure laws by considering a hypothetical case of two farmers who wish to erect\na sign to support a candidate for state office. As a preliminary matter, the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly cautioned against using hypothetical situations as a basis for\ndeciding a law's constitutionality: the \"power of pronouncing an Act of Congress\nunconstitutional\" is \"delicate,\" and it \"would indeed be undesirable for this Court to\nconsider every conceivable situation which might possibly arise in the application of\ncomplex and comprehensive legislation.\" United States v.

It is worth noting\nat the outset that these requirements would hardly be onerous for our hypothetical\nfarmers. The majority's hypothetical seems to assume that the farmers are\nunsophisticated business people, inexperienced in filling out forms and interacting\nwith the bureaucracy of government. However, even the smallest business regularly\nfiles government forms and reports that are significantly more complicated and\nburdensome than the requirements of Minnesota's disclosures laws. I make this point\nnot to argue that any burden less than that of filing taxes or employment forms is\nconstitutional, but to point out that we should not consider the burdens the Minnesota\nlaws impose in a vacuum. Moreover, while I acknowledge the majority's assertion\nthat the Minnesota laws require associations to choose whether to comply with the\n\n                                           -35-\n\fdisclosure requirements or refrain from protected First Amendment activity, see supra\nat 15, I do not believe this fact automatically makes the laws likely to be found\nunconstitutional. Indeed, the Supreme Court has, on several occasions, upheld\nregulations that condition constitutionally protected conduct on compliance with\nregulatory requirements. See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110904\"><a href=\"/opinion/110904/anderson-v-celebrezze/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788 (1983)\n(noting that although \"rights of voters are fundamental,\" states may enact\n\"comprehensive and sometimes complex election codes\" that \"govern the registration\nand qualification of voters, the selection and eligibility of candidates, or the voting\nprocess itself,\" even though these regulations \"inevitably affect[]—at least to some\ndegree—the individual's right to vote and his right to associate with others for political\nends\"); Cox v.

For these two farmers, the report\nwould contain minimal information—likely only the source of the contributions that\npaid for the sign, the expenditures made for the sign, and the names and addresses of\nthe association's members—the two farmers. After this initial report, the farmers\nwould, as the majority notes, be subject to ongoing reporting requirements. They\nwould be required to file a total of five reports during election years and one report\nduring non-election years. These reports would contain information on any further\npolitical activity undertaken by the farmers' association. If, as the majority's\nhypothetical situation indicates, the farmers did not make further expenditures after\ntheir initial expenditure on the sign, these reports would simply be a statement of\ninactivity—their reporting requirements would consist solely of checking one box on\na one-page form.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\f      If the farmers wished to escape this ongoing reporting requirement, this too\nwould be an option for them under the Minnesota disclosure laws. The farmers could\nchoose to dissolve their association by settling debts, disposing of remaining assets\nin excess of $100, and filing a termination report. Minn. Stat. § 10A.24, subdiv. 1.\nFor these two farmers, settling debts and returning contributions would likely be a\nnon-existent or minimal burden, as their activity—paying for and constructing a\nsign—was also slight.\n\n       Thus, Minnesota's disclosure laws do not subject associations to \"the full\npanoply of regulations that accompany status as a [federal PAC],\" as the majority\nargues. See supra at 16. This is true notwithstanding the majority's observation that\n\"Minnesota's law imposes virtually identical regulatory burdens on political funds as\nit does political committees.\" Supra at 11.

And\nwhile the laws undeniably impose some burdens on associations in Minnesota that\nengage in campaign-related speech, these burdens are not heavy and are substantially\nrelated to the government's disclosure interests. Under exacting scrutiny, the mere\nexistence of burdens on campaign-related speech is insufficient to render a restriction\nunconstitutional.

In my view, that paragraph’s reliance on a state interest in\ndeterring “improper or suspect relationships” between elected officials and supporters\nwho make independent expenditures is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s holding\nthat “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise\nto corruption or the appearance of corruption.” Citizens United v. Fed. Elec. Comm’n,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 909 (2010). As the D.C. Circuit explained, however, “[b]ecause\ndisclosure requirements inhibit speech less than do contribution and expenditure\nlimits, the Supreme Court has not limited the government’s acceptable interests to\nanti-corruption alone.” SpeechNow.org v. Fed. Elec. Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749\"><a href=\"/opinion/749/speechnow-org-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696\n(D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc). The other interests invoked by the State are sufficiently\nimportant to justify the disclosure requirements at issue here.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                        -38-\n\f</pre>",
