Living quarters at the East Cell House are better than at the West Cell House.

George, 377 F.2d 228 (8th Cir. 1967), compel an end to this official policy of racial segregation.  If disruptions would occur as a result of the desegregation of this facility we would expect that the administrators would take appropriate action against the offending inmates, black or white.  But to us, as to Judge Urbom, the image of the entire Nebraska penal system being held at bay by 50 prisoners is unacceptable, and the effect of the official policy, which is to reward them for their intransigent racial attitudes, cannot be legally sanctioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is incumbent upon the officials in charge to make other provisions for housing those who would commit assaults or aggravations on other inmates, white or black, and thus only penalize those guilty of offending the personal and constitutional rights of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The State suggests in its brief that it now has certain administrative procedures which these plaintiffs could pursue to obtain the relief they seek.
