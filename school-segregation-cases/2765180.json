She brings eleven points of error in cause number 10-94-169-CV, complaining\r\nthat the court failed to enforce a premarital agreement, rendered judgment based on a jury verdict\r\nthat characterized property without sufficient support in the evidence, and improperly allocated,\r\nand ordered paid, the parties' debts and liabilities.  In cause number 10-94-251-CV she complains\r\nabout the court's appointment of a receiver to sell the parties' home under the judgment in the\r\ndivorce suit.  We will reverse a portion of the court's characterization of the parties' property and\r\nthe division of the community estate, but dismiss as moot her appeal from the receivership.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue met Larry when she went to work as an executive secretary for Buffalo Airlines, an\r\nairfreight company operated by Larry.  They married January 17, 1986.  On the day of the\r\nwedding, they entered into a premarital agreement that had been drafted by a Washington, D.C.,\r\nattorney who specialized in aviation law.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Larry elected to sell Buffalo Airlines in early 1989 for\r\nroughly $2 million.  The parties deposited cash proceeds of $1.525 million from the sale into joint\r\naccounts, and, additionally, a promissory note from the purchaser for $224,000 was made payable\r\nto both Larry and Sue.  After paying debts of approximately $515,768, they used $750,000 of the\r\nproceeds to purchase certificates of deposits, in both names, and as the CDs matured, the funds\r\nwere used to purchase municipal bonds, again in both names.  Over time, portions of the proceeds\r\nwere spent on income taxes, debt repayment, plane purchases, living expenses, and various other\r\nexpenses.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>At trial, the parties disagreed over the characterization of certain assets.  Among the disputed\r\nassets were nine types of municipal bonds, a promissory note, two airplanes, various airplane\r\nparts, a car, electronic equipment, furniture, tools, and a gun and parts collection.  By jury\r\nquestion number one, the court allowed the jury to characterize and value this property.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The jury placed a total value of $394,975 on the property.  It also found that Sue owned 20% of seven types\r\nof the bonds and 50% of one of the planes as her separate property, for a total value of $54,000,\r\nand that Larry owned the rest of the assets as his separate property.  The judgment varied from\r\nthe jury's characterization of these assets and divided all of the property, except for the $10,000\r\ngun collection, as 20% Sue's separate property and 80% Larry's separate property.  The gun\r\ncollection was awarded to Larry as 100% his separate property.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Thus, by the court's division\r\nof the disputed property, Sue owned $76,995 of the assets as her separate property and Larry\r\nowned $307,980 of the assets as his separate property.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>PROPERTY DIVISION (CAUSE NO. 10-94-169-CV)</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In her petition for a divorce, Sue pleaded that the parties' property should be divided\r\naccording to the characterization in the agreement.  Larry pleaded that the agreement should not\r\nbe enforced because it was ambiguous concerning its application upon divorce.  Sue attached a\r\ncopy of the agreement to her amended petitions and introduced a copy into evidence at the trial. \r\nDuring the charge conference, Sue objected to submitting the list of property purchased with the\r\nproceeds from the sale of Buffalo Airways for the jury's characterization because:  \"All of these\r\nitems contained on question number one, about which the jury is now being asked to render an\r\nopinion . . . is contemplated by and covered by the terms and conditions of the premarital\r\nagreement . . . .\"  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>After the jury returned the verdict dividing the property between Sue's and Larry's separate\r\nestates, <i>i.e.</i>, finding none of the property to be community in character, Sue filed a motion to\r\ndisregard the jury's findings and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  She again argued that\r\n\"[t]he question of characterization of the property of the parties as contained in Question No. 1\r\n. . . is governed by . . . the construction of the pre-marital agreement, which is a question of law\r\nfor the Court.\"  She also argued in her motion that \"[t]he jury finding in regard to characterization\r\nis immaterial and does not govern the characterization of the property because that characterization\r\nis governed, as a matter of law, by the agreement of the parties.\"  She requested that the court\r\nrender judgment according to the scheme she set out in the motion to disregard.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>However, the court rendered judgment according to the findings of the jury regarding the\r\nownership of the property gained from the sale of the airline, with the indicated adjustments.  It\r\ndid not make an express ruling on the enforceability or interpretation of the premarital agreement. \r\nSue requested that the court enter findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the agreement. \r\n<i>See</i> <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 296.  When the court failed to file its findings and conclusions timely, she\r\nfiled the proper notice of past due findings and conclusions.  The court, however, also failed to\r\nrespond to this reminder.  <i>See id</i>. 297.  Additionally, Sue filed a motion for a new trial, again\r\nurging that the court erred by failing to implement the premarital agreement and to divide the\r\nproperty according to the characterization in the agreement.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Enforcement of the Premarital Agreement</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue complains in her first point of error that the court did not divide the assets in accordance\r\nwith the agreement and, in point three, that the court failed to make findings relating to the\r\nenforceability of the agreement.  The agreement is presumptively enforceable.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann.</span> § 5.46 (Vernon 1993); <i>Grossman v. Grossman</i>, 799 S.W.2d 511, 513 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1990, no writ).  Larry bore the burden to demonstrate that the agreement\r\nwas not enforceable if he desired to avoid its provisions.  <i>See id</i>.  He attempted to raise the\r\ncommon-law defense of ambiguity to avoid its effect.  <i>See Daniel v. Daniel</i>, 779 S.W.2d 110, 114\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ) (holding that the common-law defenses were not\r\neliminated by the Family Code); <i>but see</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.46(c) (Vernon Supp. 1995)\r\n(section 5.46 prospectively amended to eliminate the common-law defenses to enforcing a\r\npremarital agreement executed after September 1, 1993).  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Ambiguity is a question of law to be determined by the court.  <i>See Coker v. Coker</i>, 650\r\nS.W.2d 391, 393-94 (Tex. 1983).  An agreement is ambiguous \"when its meaning is uncertain and\r\ndoubtful or it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.\"  <i>Id</i>. at 393.  Only if the court\r\nconcludes that the agreement is ambiguous must the fact-finder determine the true intent of the\r\nparties.  <i>See id</i>. at 393-94.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Larry claimed at trial that the agreement is unclear about its effect upon the parties' divorce. \r\nHowever, the agreement plainly states that upon a divorce the disposition of \"jointly held\r\nproperty\" is to be determined by the \"ordinary principles of State law.\"  As a matter of law, then,\r\nthe agreement is not ambiguous concerning its effect upon a divorce.  Thus, the court erred when\r\nit failed to enforce the premarital agreement between Larry and Sue.  Point one is sustained.  We\r\noverrule point three because our disposition of point one moots the argument Sue presents in it.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization of Property</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In points two, four, and five, Sue attacks the characterization of property she alleges is subject\r\nto the agreement, claiming that by failing to enforce the agreement the court mischaracterized the\r\nproperty in its judgment and that the jury's findings characterizing the property are not supported\r\nby legally or factually sufficient evidence.  In point six, she claims that the court improperly\r\ndivested her of separate property.  In points seven and eight, she argues that the jury's verdict and\r\nthe court's judgment are not supported by sufficient evidence establishing that the property is part\r\nof Larry's separate estate and not a part of the community estate.  To rule on these points, we\r\nmust determine how the parties' property is characterized with reference to the premarital\r\nagreement and \"ordinary principles\" of Texas law.  We first apply \"ordinary principles\" of Texas\r\nlaw to interpret the meaning of \"jointly held property\" and \"joint interest\" to determine how\r\nproperty subject to the agreement is to be characterized and what property is subject to the\r\nagreement.  Then we will examine the evidence to determine if the jury's findings and the court's\r\nconclusions are supported by the evidence.  We will confine our discussion to only those assets\r\nthat the parties disagree about ownership, <i>i.e.</i>, those assets submitted to the jury in jury question\r\nnumber one.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization Under the Agreement</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>\"The term ‛joint interest' means joined together in interest, a united interest or an interest\r\nshared in common.\"  <i>Jennings v. Srp</i>, 521 S.W.2d 326, 328 (Tex. Civ. App.—Corpus Christi\r\n1975, no writ); <i>see also Kneisley v. Intertex, Inc.</i>, 797 S.W.2d 343, 345 (Tex. App.—Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1990, no writ).  The deposit of the funds into the joint account had the effect of\r\ndivesting the original owner of the exclusive ownership and control of the funds and vesting joint\r\ncontrol and ownership in both parties, <i>i.e.</i>, Larry and Sue agreed that the depositing spouse would\r\nmake a gift of an ownership interest to the other spouse of any separate-property funds deposited\r\ninto their joint accounts.  <i>See Kennedy v. Beasley</i>, 606 S.W.2d 1, 4 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston\r\n[1st Dist.] 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <i>see also Powell v. Powell</i>, 822 S.W.2d 181, 183 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1991, writ denied).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue argues that the gift is from the depositing spouse's separate estate to the other spouse's\r\nseparate estate.  She bases this argument on precedent which holds that a third party cannot make\r\na gift to the community estate; any gift to the spouses together becomes half owned by each of\r\ntheir separate estates.  <i>See, e.g., Marshall v. Marshall</i>, 735 S.W.2d 587, 598 (Tex. App.—Dallas\r\n1987, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <i>McLemore v. McLemore</i>, 641 S.W.2d 395, 397 (Tex. Civ. App.—Tyler\r\n1982, no writ); <i>see also</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.01(a)(2).  However, this rule applies to\r\nspouses also:  A spouse may not make a gift to the community estate.  <i>See Tittle v. Tittle</i>, 148 Tex.\r\n102, 220 S.W.2d 637 (1949); <i>Matter of Marriage of Thurmond</i>, 888 S.W.2d 269, 273 n.1 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Amarillo 1994, writ denied); <i>Celso v. Celso</i>, 864 S.W.2d 652, 655 (Tex. App.—Tyler\r\n1993, no writ).  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We conclude that the language of the agreement comports with these ordinary principles of\r\nTexas law.  The agreement states that the depositing of separate funds into the joint account is a\r\n\"voluntary transfer . . . <i>to the other spouse</i>.\"  Thus, the agreement itself contemplates a gift to the\r\nnon-depositing <i>spouse</i>, not to the estate they share, <i>i.e.</i>, to the spouse's separate estate, not to the\r\ncommunity estate.  <i>See Tittle</i>, 220 S.W.2d at 642; <i>Kennedy</i>, 606 S.W.2d at 4.  Therefore, under\r\nthe agreement, separate property funds deposited in the joint account became 50% Sue's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Larry's separate property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization Under Texas Law</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Next, we must determine which of the assets listed in jury question one are properly\r\ncharacterized with reference to the agreement.  The key factor in the agreement is the conversion\r\nof separate property of one spouse into separate property of the other spouse.  Thus, the agreement\r\ndoes not affect property which Texas law determines to be community.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Legal Principles</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Separate property consists of property owned or claimed before marriage, property acquired\r\nduring the marriage by gift, devise, or descent, recovery for personal injury, and property\r\ndesignated as such by agreement; all other property acquired during marriage is community\r\nproperty.  <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> §§ 5.01, 5.43, 5.52.  Property possessed by either spouse\r\nduring or on dissolution of a marriage is presumed to be community property.  <span>Tex. Fam. Code\r\nAnn.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham v. Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d 162, 167 (Tex. 1975); <i>Scott v. Scott</i>, 805\r\nS.W.2d 835, 837 (Tex. App.—Waco 1991, writ denied).  The presumption can only be rebutted\r\nby clear and convincing evidence showing that specific assets are derived from a spouse's separate\r\nestate.  <i>Id</i>.  That is, the party asserting a separate-property interest in an asset has the burden of\r\n\"tracing\" the source of the asset from separate property to the specific asset.  <i>Id</i>.  When\r\ncommunity and separate property have been so commingled as to make segregation impossible,\r\nthe statutory presumption prevails, and all of the property is considered part of the community\r\nestate.  <i>McKinley v. McKinley</i>, 496 S.W.2d 540, 543 (Tex. 1973). </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We apply legal- and factual-sufficiency standards of review to determine if the community-property presumption has been rebutted.  In determining whether legally-sufficient evidence rebuts\r\nthe presumption, we view the evidence in the light which tends to support the jury's findings and\r\ndisregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary.  <i>See Weirich v. Weirich</i>, 833 S.W.2d 942,\r\n945 (Tex. 1992).  If there is no evidence or merely a scintilla of evidence to support the jury's\r\nfindings, we will sustain Sue's challenge.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes v. Welch Associates</i>, 793\r\nS.W.2d 660, 666 &amp; n.9 (Tex. 1990); <i>Kindred v. Con/Chem, Inc.</i>, 650 S.W.2d 61, 63 (Tex.\r\n1983).  In reviewing a factual-insufficiency claim, we consider all of the evidence and determine\r\nif the challenged finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\r\nmanifestly unjust.  <i>See Pool v. Ford Motor Co.</i>, 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex. 1986).  Finally, when\r\nSue has the burden of proof on an issue, we use the \"matter of law\" standard of review.  <i>See</i>\r\n<i>Sterner v. Marathon Oil Co.</i>, 767 S.W.2d 686, 690 (Tex. 1989).  To sustain this burden, she must\r\nshow that there is no evidence supporting the finding and, then, that her contrary position has been\r\nestablished as a matter of law.  <i>See id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization of Specific Assets</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Municipal Bonds</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Buffalo Airlines issued 100 shares of stock.  Initially, Larry owned 40 shares, a second\r\ninvestor named Lund owned 40 shares, and Larry's father, M.D. Walston, owned the remaining\r\n20 shares.  Ultimately, Larry claimed ownership of all 100 shares.  Sue conceded at trial that\r\nLarry owned 40 shares before their marriage.  However, she claimed that they acquired the other\r\n60 shares during the marriage.  Larry conceded that he had acquired the 60 shares after marriage,\r\nbut contended that he had obtained them through gifts—40 from Buffalo and 20 from his father. \r\nIf true, 100% of the proceeds from the sale of Buffalo would potentially be covered by the\r\npremarital agreement because property acquired by gift during the course of the marriage is\r\nseparate property of the donee.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.01(a)(2).  However, Larry had\r\nthe burden to rebut the community-property presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837.  We\r\nconclude that he failed to carry this burden.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Prior to Larry's and Sue's marriage, Buffalo bought Lund's 40 shares and held them as\r\ntreasury stock.  Sue introduced Buffalo's corporate minutes, dated July 17, 1987, which reflected\r\nthat the board of directors had unanimously voted to \"pay Larry W. Walston a stock bonus of 40\r\nshares of Treasury Stock as a reward for the Company's fine performance last year.\"  Thus, Sue\r\nshowed that Larry obtained 40 shares as payment for his services to Buffalo after their marriage,\r\nestablishing that the 40 shares were community property.  <i>See Jensen v. Jensen</i>, 665 S.W.2d 107,\r\n109 (Tex. 1984).  Although Larry claimed that he would adduce evidence to rebut these corporate\r\nminutes, the only evidence that he presented was his testimony.  We conclude that his testimony\r\nis a mere scintilla of evidence.  <i>See</i> <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, he failed to present\r\nsufficient evidence to rebut the community-property presumption regarding these 40 shares.  <i>See\r\nJuliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666 &amp; n.9; <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>,\r\n527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue claimed that she and Larry purchased M.D. Walston's 20 shares of stock for $75,000\r\nafter the sale of Buffalo.  She presented wire transfer receipts documenting two transfers to M.D.\r\nWalston, one of $30,000 and a second for $45,000.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Larry claimed that his father had given the\r\nstock to him.  However, the only evidence Larry provided was his testimony; he provide no\r\nobjective evidence showing that he received the stock as a gift from his father.  Again, we\r\nconclude that Larry provided only a scintilla of evidence that he obtained these 20 shares by gift. \r\n<i>See</i> <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, he failed to rebut the community presumption that attached\r\nwhen he acquired ownership of the shares after his marriage to Sue.  Therefore, these 20 shares\r\nwere also owned as part of the community estate.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666\r\n&amp; n.9; <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837. \r\nThus, we conclude that 40% of the proceeds of the sale of Buffalo Airlines was Larry's separate\r\nproperty at the time of the sale and the remaining 60% was owned by the community estate.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>As already noted, Buffalo Airlines sold for approximately $2 million.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Although the sale\r\nclosed at the end of February 1989, the buyer began payments with a $100,000 cashier's check\r\non January 27, 1989, apparently deposited into an account held by Larry and Sue (the 202\r\naccount).  The buyer made two more cash payments that were wired into another (the 316 account)\r\njoint account—a $475,000 payment on February 28 and a $950,000 payment on March 2.  Finally,\r\non May 19 the buyer executed a promissory note for $224,000, payable to both Larry and Sue. \r\nThus, for the sale of Buffalo, they received $1.525 million in cash, of which $1.425 million was\r\ndeposited into the 316 joint account, and a $224,000 promissory note.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>After receipt of the last major payment, the parties began withdrawing funds from the 316\r\naccount.  On March 3 they paid a Buffalo debt from the account in the amount of $200,644.44\r\nand, on March 14, they paid a debt owed by Larry in the amount of $315,124.99.  Thus,\r\n$515,769.43 of the cash proceeds in the 316 account were immediately used to pay debts.  On the\r\nsame day as the second debt payment, March 14, Larry and Sue purchased $750,000 worth of\r\ncertificates of deposits, utilizing the money in this joint account.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue testified to these transactions, assisted by a ledger she prepared for trial.  She did not\r\nintroduce any bank statements or canceled checks to support her testimony, but did introduce the\r\nwire transfer receipts.  Wire transfer receipts for the February 28 and March 3 deposits are\r\nincluded in the record.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Larry testified about these transactions, too.  He introduced the January 27 cashier's check\r\nand a deposit slip for the 202 account, reflecting a $100,000 deposit on January 30.  He also\r\nintroduced the February statement from the 316 account, showing the $1.425 million in deposits\r\nand the withdrawals discussed above.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The CDs were purchased in both Larry's and Sue's name.  As the CDs matured, the funds\r\nwere either reinvested in other CDs or used to purchase the municipal bonds on hand at the end\r\nof the marriage.  Again, the municipal bonds were purchased in both of their names.  Sue's\r\nevidence indicated that the funds from the maturing CDs were actually redeposited into the 316\r\naccount just prior to being reinvested in the municipal bonds.  Larry testified, however, that the\r\nfunds went directly from the CDs into the municipal bonds.  According to Sue's testimony, the\r\nfirst bond purchase occurred on May 30.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Neither party presented bank documents which would allow the fact-finder to actually trace\r\neach dollar's path from the purchase of Buffalo Airlines to the municipal bonds on hand at the\r\ndissolution of the marriage.  The documentary evidence the parties did supply showed that the 316\r\naccount received funds from other sources, for instance, a deposit on March 21, which the bank\r\nstatement indicates is an interest payment, and withdrawals for undetermined purposes.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Under Texas community-property law, the $1.425 million before its deposit in the 316\r\naccount belonged 60% ($855,000) to the community and 40% ($570,000) to Larry's separate\r\nestate.  After the money was deposited into the account, the premarital agreement legally\r\nrecharacterized the funds so that they were then owned 60% ($855,000) by the community, 20%\r\n($285,000) by Larry's separate estate, and 20% ($285,000) by Sue's separate estate.  Because the\r\n316 account contained both separate and community funds, a presumption applies that the first\r\nfunds withdrawn were community property.  <i>See Welder v. Welder</i>, 794 S.W.2d 420, 433 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1990, no writ).  Thus, the $515,769.43 used to pay debts in March are\r\npresumed to be community funds, reducing the community share of the account to 32.8%\r\n($279,210.57), and increasing Larry's and Sue's separate-property portion to 33.6% each. \r\nBecause the next withdrawal from the account was the $750,000 to pay for CDs, the community\r\nshare of the account was exhausted, and the additional $470,789.43 used to purchase the $750,000\r\nin CDs came equally from the parties' separate funds in the account.  <i>See id</i>.; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d\r\nat 838.  Thus, the CDs, when purchased, were 37.2% community, 31.4% Larry's separate\r\nproperty, and 31.4% Sue's separate property.  <i>See Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 838.  The bonds\r\npurchased with the proceeds of the CDs were, then, at most, 31.4% Larry's separate property and\r\n31.4% Sue's separate property, with the community claiming at least 37.2% of the bonds' value.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>To preserve their separate-property interest in the bonds, either Larry or Sue had to trace the\r\nseparate assets used to purchase the CDs into the bonds.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02;\r\n<i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837.  However, neither one presented\r\nsufficient evidence to segregate the funds used to purchase the bonds into a community share and\r\na separate-property share.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650\r\nS.W.2d at 63.  We conclude that the funds were hopelessly commingled.  <i>See McKinley</i>, 496\r\nS.W.2d at 543.  Thus, the community-property presumption prevails, and those bonds, which\r\nwere purchased with money from the CDs and the 316 account, did not retain any separate-property character.  <i>See id</i>.  Any contrary conclusion by the jury or the court was not supported\r\nby the evidence.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at\r\n63.  Thus, the bonds listed as items number three through nine on jury question number one are\r\n100% community property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue conceded at trial that the El Paso County Junior College bonds and the City of Pearland\r\nbonds were purchased prior to her marriage to Larry.  Thus, by concession, they  are Larry's\r\nseparate property.  She admitted that she had no claim to the Pearland bonds.  She claimed,\r\nhowever, that Larry made a gift of one-half of the El Paso County Junior College bonds to her. \r\nTo sustain this claim, Sue had the burden of proving (1) Larry intended to make the gift, (2)\r\ndelivery of the property to her, and (3) her acceptance of the gift.  <i>See Powell</i>, 822 S.W.2d at 183. \r\nWe conclude that she failed to carry her burden of proof.  <i>See</i> <i>Sterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 690.  Thus,\r\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the bonds listed as numbers 1 and 2\r\non jury question number one are 100% Larry's separate property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Vehicles</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The jury found that the car and one of the planes submitted in jury question number one, a\r\n1990 Cadillac and a 1970 Cessna 414, were 100% Larry's separate property.  The jury found that\r\nthe second plane, a 1967 Cessna 150, was 50% Larry's and 50% Sue's separate property.  The\r\ncourt again deviated from the jury's findings, awarding all three 20% to Sue and 80% to Larry. \r\nWe must examine the evidence to determine if the court's failure to enforce the premarital\r\nagreement resulted in a misharacterization of these assets.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue testified that the Cadillac was purchased with funds from the 316 joint account.  Larry\r\ntestified that \"a check was written directly for this car,\" without specifying which account the\r\nmoney came from.  However, he testified that \"the bond money came directly to my checking\r\naccount; and a check was written directly for this car.\"  Larry failed to identify which \"bonds\"\r\nwere the source of the funds.  Apart from Larry's vague testimony, neither party presented any\r\nevidence to rebut the community-property presumption.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d\r\nat 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, the Cadillac is properly characterized as 100%\r\ncommunity property.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>,\r\n805 S.W.2d at 837.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Both Larry and Sue testified that the Cessna 414 was purchased immediately after the stock\r\nproceeds were deposited.  Sue put into evidence a canceled check, dated March 14, 1989,\r\nrepresenting the purchase price of the airplane.  This asset is directly traced to the 316 account\r\nafter the transactions involving the debt payments and CD purchases.  Thus, because the account\r\nhad been drained of community property prior to the purchase of the airplane, the Cessna 414 is\r\nproperly characterized by the terms of the premarital agreement as being 50% Larry's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Sue's separate property.  <i>See Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 838; <i>Welder</i>, 794 S.W.2d\r\nat 433.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Cessna 150 was purchased in the summer of 1991.  Sue claimed that Larry bought the\r\nplane as a gift for her.  However, she did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate as a\r\nmatter of law that she obtained the plane as a gift.  <i>See</i> <i>Sterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 690; <i>Powell</i>, 822\r\nS.W.2d at 183.  Larry testified that he bought the plane with a $4,000 separate-property\r\n\"credit\"—<i>i.e.</i>, with money then owed to him by the plane's owner as a result of their business\r\ndealings—and $4,000 of \"family money.\"  Thus, Larry alleged that the airplane was 50% his\r\nseparate property and 50% community property.  However, he stated that the credit \"had\r\naccumulated over a year or so period.\"  Thus, the credit was acquired during his marriage to Sue\r\nand was presumptively a community asset.  Both Larry and Sue failed to present any evidence\r\nwhich would support the jury's finding that the airplane was 50% the separate property of each,\r\nnor evidence to support the court's judgment dividing ownership of the plane as 20% Sue's\r\nseparate property and 80% Larry's separate property.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d\r\nat 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, the community-property presumption prevails,\r\nand the Cessna 150 is 100% community property.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02;\r\n<i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837.  <span>Chattels</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The \"chattels\" included in jury question one are items 14 through 25 (a computer, a\r\ntypewriter, three cellular telephones, airplane parts, a Pratt and Whitney PT6, a glass table with\r\nfour chairs, two wing chairs, two file cabinets, a band saw, a table saw, and scaffolding).  Larry\r\ntestified that these items were property of Buffalo Airlines and were not included in the company's\r\nsale.  He presented a letter from the buyer documenting that items 14 through 19 (the computer,\r\ntypewriter, three cellular telephones, airplane parts, and Pratt and Whitney PT6) were not being\r\ntransferred with the airline's assets.  Sue agreed with Larry's testimony.  Because these items were\r\ninitially the property of Buffalo Airlines but were conveyed to the parties by some method, the\r\nparties acquired ownership of the items during the course of their marriage.  Therefore, these\r\nitems are presumptively community property.  Neither party presented any evidence which tended\r\nto rebut this presumption.  <i>See id</i>.  Thus, the presumption prevails and these items are owned by\r\nthe community estate.  <i>See id</i>.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Remaining items</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Only two items in jury question number one have not been addressed:  item 13, a \"Note\r\nreceivable from Lifeline Partners LTD,\" and item 26, the gun collection.  Sue stated that the\r\nLifeline note derived from a failed contract between Buffalo Airlines and Lifeline.  When Buffalo\r\nwas sold, the note was excluded from the transaction and conveyed to Larry.  Larry concurred in\r\nSue's description of the source of this item.  Thus, like the chattels above, the Lifeline note was\r\nacquired from Buffalo Airline during the course of the marriage and, because neither party\r\npresented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, is owned by the community.  <i>See id</i>. \r\nFinally, item 26 is a gun collection.  Sue conceded that Larry owned the collection before they\r\nwere married, but claimed that he spent approximately $10,000 in funds adding to it during the\r\nmarriage.  However, she does not challenge the court's awarding the collection to Larry as 100%\r\nhis separate property.  Thus, we will not consider the disposition of the gun collection in this\r\nappeal.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Disposition of Points Two, Four, Five, Six, Seven, and Eight</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We hold that the evidence mandates the conclusion that the City of Lubbock, City of Austin,\r\nEast Central I.S.D., Marble Falls I.S.D., City of San Antonio, City of Rockport, and Ellis County\r\nWater bonds (items 3 through 9) are 100% community property.  Likewise, the Cadillac DeVille\r\n(item 10), the Cessna 150 (item 12), the Lifeline note (item 13), and the \"chattels\" (items 14\r\nthrough 25) are 100% community property.  The Cessna 414 (item 11) is 50% Larry's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Sue's separate property.  Finally, the El Paso County Junior College and the\r\nCity of Pearland bonds (items 1 and 2) are 100% Larry's separate property.  Because the court\r\ndeviated from these characterizations, its judgment is not supported by the evidence.  Likewise,\r\nthe jury's verdict is not supported by the evidence either. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The court's judgment divested Larry of 20% of his separate-property bonds and divested Sue\r\nof her separate-property interest in 30% of the Cessna 414.  Because such divestiture is\r\nimpermissible, we must reverse the court's judgment dividing these two assets.  <i>See Cameron v.\r\nCameron</i>, 641 S.W.2d 210, 219 (Tex. 1982).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Of the $384,975 in assets in jury question number one, the court found that $307,980 was\r\nLarry's separate property and $76,995 was Sue's separate property.  As we have shown, the\r\nevidence supports only a finding that $75,000 belonged to Larry's separate estate, that $25,000\r\nbelonged to Sue's separate estate, and that $284,975 was owned as community property. \r\nMischaracterizing community assets as separate property does not necessarily result in reversal. \r\n<i>See Jacobs v. Jacobs</i>, 687 S.W.2d 731, 733 (Tex. 1985); <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d 841.  Reversal is\r\nmandated only if the error has materially affected the court's \"just and right\" division of the\r\ncommunity estate.  <i>Id</i>.  When we seek to determine if the error had this effect, we can consider\r\nwhat division the court probably would have made if the property had been properly characterized. \r\n<i>See Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 841-42.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The court divided the assets characterized as community property at the trial 50% to Sue and\r\n50% to Larry.  Under the judgment the court rendered, the total community estate, as we have\r\ncharacterized it, is divided 64% to Larry and 36% to Sue.  Contrasted with the division of the\r\ncommunity estate at the court's disposal, we conclude that the error in failing to enforce the\r\npremarital agreement and rendering judgment unsupported by the evidence materially affected the\r\nproperty division.  <i>See id</i>.  Thus, points two, four, five, six, seven, and eight are sustained. \r\nBecause we have sustained these points, we will reverse the court's property division and remand\r\nthe property division to the trial court for redivision.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Division of the Debts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In point nine, Sue argues that the court abused its discretion in dividing the parties' debts. \r\nThe debts are part of the community estate, and the trial court is charged with dividing that estate\r\nin a \"just and right\" manner.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 3.63(a); <i>McKnight v. McKnight</i>, 543\r\nS.W.2d 863, 866-67 (Tex. 1976); <i>Vannerson v. Vannerson</i>, 857 S.W.2d 659, 673 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, writ denied).  We cannot reverse only a portion of the division\r\nof the community estate.  <i>See Jacobs</i>, 687 S.W.2d at 733.  We have found that the court's error\r\nin mischaracterizing the property of the parties affected the \"just and right\" division of the\r\ncommunity estate and will reverse the court's division.  <i>See id</i>.  When we remand the property\r\ndivision to the trial court, we necessarily remand the division of the debts.  Thus, point nine is\r\nsustained and the court's division of the parties' debts will also be reversed.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Payment of the Debts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Finally, in her last two points in cause number 10-94-169-CV, Sue directly attacks the court's\r\njudgment.  She first claims in point ten that the court \"erred in its methodology\" by requiring that\r\nthe parties' debts be repaid immediately.  In point eleven, she asserts that the court erred by\r\nrequiring that she pay her general debts from the proceeds of the sale of her homestead.  However,\r\nbefore Sue can complain about the court's judgment on appeal, she must have brought the\r\ncomplaint to the trial court's attention.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. R. App. P.</span> 52(a); <i>Young v. Hodde</i>, 682 S.W.2d\r\n236, 237 (Tex. 1984); <i>Strahan v. Davis</i>, 872 S.W.2d 828, 836-37 (Tex. App.—Waco 1994, writ\r\ndenied); <i>Winters v. Arm Refining Co., Inc.</i>, 830 S.W.2d 737, 738-39 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\r\n1992, writ denied).  She did not raise these complaints about the judgment in her Motion to\r\nDisregard Jury Findings, for Judgment Non Obstante Veredicto, and for Judgment on the Verdict,\r\nor her Motion for New Trial.  Nor has she, in her brief, pointed out where in the record she raised\r\nthe complaints in the trial court.  Because she failed to preserve these complaints for appellate\r\nreview, we overrule points ten and eleven.  <i>See id</i>.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>RECEIVERSHIP (CAUSE NUMBER 10-94-251-CV)</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>As part of the property division in the divorce decree, the court ordered the parties' homestead\r\nsold and the proceeds distributed 50% to each.  Following entry of the final divorce decree, Sue\r\nfiled her cost bond but did not post a supersedeas bond.  Larry then instituted a partition suit,\r\nseeking to have the homestead sold so that its value could be divided according to the divorce\r\ndecree.  The court denied Sue's plea in abatement and appointed a receiver to sell the homestead. \r\nIn cause number 10-94-251-CV, Sue complains about that appointment.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>She argues in her first point that the court abused its discretion in appointing the receiver\r\nbecause the property was not in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 64.001(b) (Vernon 1986).  In her second point she argues that\r\nthe court did not have jurisdiction to appoint the receiver.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> §\r\n3.58(h)(3).  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>During the pendency of cause number 10-94-251-CV, Sue filed three motions for leave to file\r\na petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking to prohibit the court from continuing with the\r\nreceivership.  We denied leave to file each time.  On February 1, 1995, the receiver sold the\r\nresidence.  By order dated February 15, the trial court discharged the receiver and closed the\r\nreceivership.  Our clerk notified the parties on March 28, 1995, that this appeal appeared to be\r\nmoot and subject to being dismissed unless one of them could show grounds for continuing it.  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. R. App. P.</span> 60(a)(2), 83.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A cause is moot when there is no actual controversy between the parties or if the court's\r\naction on the merits cannot affect the rights of the parties.  <i>Texas Educ. Agency v. Leeper</i>, 893\r\nS.W.2d 432, 441 (Tex. 1994); <i>VE Corp. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i>, 860 S.W.2d 83, 84 (Tex. 1993).  At\r\nthis time, the receivership has served its function and has been closed by the trial court; thus, there\r\nis no live controversy between Sue and Larry regarding the now nonexistent receivership.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because no controversy now exists between the parties, any opinion we may render on Sue's\r\nappeal of the receivership would constitute an advisory opinion.  <i>See General Land Office v. OXY\r\nU.S.A., Inc.</i>, 789 S.W.2d 569, 570 (Tex. 1990).  We are constitutionally prohibited from\r\nrendering such opinions.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Const.</span> art. II, § 1; <i>Speer v. Presbyterian Children's Home</i>,\r\n847 S.W.2d 227, 229 (Tex. 1993).  In fact, we \"simply have no jurisdiction to render advisory\r\nopinions.\"  <i>See Speer</i>, 847 S.W.2d at 229.  Even if an issue remains as to costs, an appeal is\r\nnevertheless moot when the underlying controversy has ended.  <i>See Brownsville Sch. D. v.\r\nBrownsville Herald</i>, 831 S.W.2d 537, 539 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1992, no writ); <i>State v.\r\nGibson Products Co., Inc.</i>, 699 S.W.2d 640, 642 (Tex. App.—Waco 1985, no writ).   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In response to our clerk's letter of March 28, Sue filed a \"Motion to Continue Appeal.\"  She\r\nargues in the motion that the trial court acted without jurisdiction when it created the receivership\r\nand thus the acts of the receiver are void.  Thus, Sue argues, \"[i]f this appeal is heard and a\r\nfavorable ruling obtained by [her], then [she] should be able to set aside the void act of the\r\nReceiver conveying her interest in the residence.\"  However, she has not cited any authority to\r\nsupport her arguments in this motion.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue invites us to render an opinion on the validity of the court's order when such an opinion\r\nwould not be binding on the parties unless a subsequent, entirely new law suit is filed.  \"The\r\ndistinctive feature of an advisory opinion is that it decides an abstract question of law without\r\nbinding the parties.\"  <i>Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd.</i>, 852 S.W.2d 440, 444\r\n(Tex. 1993).  Any ruling on Sue's claim that the court acted without jurisdiction would not bind\r\neither party to a course of action.  Sue might be able to set aside the sale of the house as an action\r\nbased on a void order.  However, this appeal involves the appointment of the receiver, not the sale\r\nof the house.  Any decision we might render on this cause would merely predict the outcome of\r\na possible future suit to set aside the receiver's deed under which the house was sold.

We render judgment, however, declaring that the Cessna 414 is 50% Larry's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Sue's separate property, and that the El Paso County Junior College and the\r\nCity of Pearland bonds are 100% Larry's separate property.

She brings eleven points of error in cause number 10-94-169-CV, complaining\r\nthat the court failed to enforce a premarital agreement, rendered judgment based on a jury verdict\r\nthat characterized property without sufficient support in the evidence, and improperly allocated,\r\nand ordered paid, the parties' debts and liabilities.  In cause number 10-94-251-CV she complains\r\nabout the court's appointment of a receiver to sell the parties' home under the judgment in the\r\ndivorce suit.  We will reverse a portion of the court's characterization of the parties' property and\r\nthe division of the community estate, but dismiss as moot her appeal from the receivership.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue met Larry when she went to work as an executive secretary for Buffalo Airlines, an\r\nairfreight company operated by Larry.  They married January 17, 1986.  On the day of the\r\nwedding, they entered into a premarital agreement that had been drafted by a Washington, D.C.,\r\nattorney who specialized in aviation law.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Larry elected to sell Buffalo Airlines in early 1989 for\r\nroughly $2 million.  The parties deposited cash proceeds of $1.525 million from the sale into joint\r\naccounts, and, additionally, a promissory note from the purchaser for $224,000 was made payable\r\nto both Larry and Sue.  After paying debts of approximately $515,768, they used $750,000 of the\r\nproceeds to purchase certificates of deposits, in both names, and as the CDs matured, the funds\r\nwere used to purchase municipal bonds, again in both names.  Over time, portions of the proceeds\r\nwere spent on income taxes, debt repayment, plane purchases, living expenses, and various other\r\nexpenses.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>At trial, the parties disagreed over the characterization of certain assets.  Among the disputed\r\nassets were nine types of municipal bonds, a promissory note, two airplanes, various airplane\r\nparts, a car, electronic equipment, furniture, tools, and a gun and parts collection.  By jury\r\nquestion number one, the court allowed the jury to characterize and value this property.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  The jury placed a total value of $394,975 on the property.  It also found that Sue owned 20% of seven types\r\nof the bonds and 50% of one of the planes as her separate property, for a total value of $54,000,\r\nand that Larry owned the rest of the assets as his separate property.  The judgment varied from\r\nthe jury's characterization of these assets and divided all of the property, except for the $10,000\r\ngun collection, as 20% Sue's separate property and 80% Larry's separate property.  The gun\r\ncollection was awarded to Larry as 100% his separate property.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Thus, by the court's division\r\nof the disputed property, Sue owned $76,995 of the assets as her separate property and Larry\r\nowned $307,980 of the assets as his separate property.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>PROPERTY DIVISION (CAUSE NO. 10-94-169-CV)</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In her petition for a divorce, Sue pleaded that the parties' property should be divided\r\naccording to the characterization in the agreement.  Larry pleaded that the agreement should not\r\nbe enforced because it was ambiguous concerning its application upon divorce.  Sue attached a\r\ncopy of the agreement to her amended petitions and introduced a copy into evidence at the trial. \r\nDuring the charge conference, Sue objected to submitting the list of property purchased with the\r\nproceeds from the sale of Buffalo Airways for the jury's characterization because:  \"All of these\r\nitems contained on question number one, about which the jury is now being asked to render an\r\nopinion . . . is contemplated by and covered by the terms and conditions of the premarital\r\nagreement . . . .\"  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>After the jury returned the verdict dividing the property between Sue's and Larry's separate\r\nestates, <i>i.e.</i>, finding none of the property to be community in character, Sue filed a motion to\r\ndisregard the jury's findings and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.  She again argued that\r\n\"[t]he question of characterization of the property of the parties as contained in Question No. 1\r\n. . . is governed by . . . the construction of the pre-marital agreement, which is a question of law\r\nfor the Court.\"  She also argued in her motion that \"[t]he jury finding in regard to characterization\r\nis immaterial and does not govern the characterization of the property because that characterization\r\nis governed, as a matter of law, by the agreement of the parties.\"  She requested that the court\r\nrender judgment according to the scheme she set out in the motion to disregard.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>However, the court rendered judgment according to the findings of the jury regarding the\r\nownership of the property gained from the sale of the airline, with the indicated adjustments.  It\r\ndid not make an express ruling on the enforceability or interpretation of the premarital agreement. \r\nSue requested that the court enter findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the agreement. \r\n<i>See</i> <span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 296.  When the court failed to file its findings and conclusions timely, she\r\nfiled the proper notice of past due findings and conclusions.  The court, however, also failed to\r\nrespond to this reminder.  <i>See id</i>. 297.  Additionally, Sue filed a motion for a new trial, again\r\nurging that the court erred by failing to implement the premarital agreement and to divide the\r\nproperty according to the characterization in the agreement.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Enforcement of the Premarital Agreement</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue complains in her first point of error that the court did not divide the assets in accordance\r\nwith the agreement and, in point three, that the court failed to make findings relating to the\r\nenforceability of the agreement.  The agreement is presumptively enforceable.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam.\r\nCode Ann.</span> § 5.46 (Vernon 1993); <i>Grossman v. Grossman</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2381158\"><a href=\"/opinion/2381158/grossman-v-grossman/\"><span class=\"volume\">799</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 513 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1990, no writ).  Larry bore the burden to demonstrate that the agreement\r\nwas not enforceable if he desired to avoid its provisions.  <i>See id</i>.  He attempted to raise the\r\ncommon-law defense of ambiguity to avoid its effect.  <i>See Daniel v. Daniel</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1775348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1775348/daniel-v-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 114\r\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, no writ) (holding that the common-law defenses were not\r\neliminated by the Family Code); <i>but see</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.46(c) (Vernon Supp. 1995)\r\n(section 5.46 prospectively amended to eliminate the common-law defenses to enforcing a\r\npremarital agreement executed after September 1, 1993).  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Ambiguity is a question of law to be determined by the court.  <i>See Coker v. Coker</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1502612\"><a href=\"/opinion/1502612/coker-v-coker/\"><span class=\"volume\">650</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span>, 393-94 (Tex. 1983).  An agreement is ambiguous \"when its meaning is uncertain and\r\ndoubtful or it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.\"  <i>Id</i>. at 393.  Only if the court\r\nconcludes that the agreement is ambiguous must the fact-finder determine the true intent of the\r\nparties.  <i>See id</i>. at 393-94.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Larry claimed at trial that the agreement is unclear about its effect upon the parties' divorce. \r\nHowever, the agreement plainly states that upon a divorce the disposition of \"jointly held\r\nproperty\" is to be determined by the \"ordinary principles of State law.\"  As a matter of law, then,\r\nthe agreement is not ambiguous concerning its effect upon a divorce.  Thus, the court erred when\r\nit failed to enforce the premarital agreement between Larry and Sue.  Point one is sustained.  We\r\noverrule point three because our disposition of point one moots the argument Sue presents in it.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization of Property</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In points two, four, and five, Sue attacks the characterization of property she alleges is subject\r\nto the agreement, claiming that by failing to enforce the agreement the court mischaracterized the\r\nproperty in its judgment and that the jury's findings characterizing the property are not supported\r\nby legally or factually sufficient evidence.  In point six, she claims that the court improperly\r\ndivested her of separate property.  In points seven and eight, she argues that the jury's verdict and\r\nthe court's judgment are not supported by sufficient evidence establishing that the property is part\r\nof Larry's separate estate and not a part of the community estate.  To rule on these points, we\r\nmust determine how the parties' property is characterized with reference to the premarital\r\nagreement and \"ordinary principles\" of Texas law.  We first apply \"ordinary principles\" of Texas\r\nlaw to interpret the meaning of \"jointly held property\" and \"joint interest\" to determine how\r\nproperty subject to the agreement is to be characterized and what property is subject to the\r\nagreement.  Then we will examine the evidence to determine if the jury's findings and the court's\r\nconclusions are supported by the evidence.  We will confine our discussion to only those assets\r\nthat the parties disagree about ownership, <i>i.e.</i>, those assets submitted to the jury in jury question\r\nnumber one.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization Under the Agreement</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>\"The term ‛joint interest' means joined together in interest, a united interest or an interest\r\nshared in common.\"  <i>Jennings v.

App.—Houston\r\n[14th Dist.] 1990, no writ).  The deposit of the funds into the joint account had the effect of\r\ndivesting the original owner of the exclusive ownership and control of the funds and vesting joint\r\ncontrol and ownership in both parties, <i>i.e.</i>, Larry and Sue agreed that the depositing spouse would\r\nmake a gift of an ownership interest to the other spouse of any separate-property funds deposited\r\ninto their joint accounts.  <i>See Kennedy v. Beasley</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1732189\"><a href=\"/opinion/1732189/kennedy-v-beasley/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (Tex.

She bases this argument on precedent which holds that a third party cannot make\r\na gift to the community estate; any gift to the spouses together becomes half owned by each of\r\ntheir separate estates.  <i>See, e.g., Marshall v. Marshall</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2429534\"><a href=\"/opinion/2429534/marshall-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>, 598 (Tex.

Civ. App.—Tyler\r\n1982, no writ); <i>see also</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.01(a)(2).  However, this rule applies to\r\nspouses also:  A spouse may not make a gift to the community estate.  <i>See Tittle v. Tittle</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">102</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></span> (1949); <i>Matter of Marriage of Thurmond</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1494128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1494128/matter-of-marriage-of-thurmond/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span>, 273 n.1 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Amarillo 1994, writ denied); <i>Celso v.

App.—Tyler\r\n1993, no writ).  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We conclude that the language of the agreement comports with these ordinary principles of\r\nTexas law.  The agreement states that the depositing of separate funds into the joint account is a\r\n\"voluntary transfer . . . <i>to the other spouse</i>.\"  Thus, the agreement itself contemplates a gift to the\r\nnon-depositing <i>spouse</i>, not to the estate they share, <i>i.e.</i>, to the spouse's separate estate, not to the\r\ncommunity estate.  <i>See Tittle</i>, 220 S.W.2d at 642; <i>Kennedy</i>, 606 S.W.2d at 4.  Therefore, under\r\nthe agreement, separate property funds deposited in the joint account became 50% Sue's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Larry's separate property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization Under Texas Law</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Next, we must determine which of the assets listed in jury question one are properly\r\ncharacterized with reference to the agreement.  The key factor in the agreement is the conversion\r\nof separate property of one spouse into separate property of the other spouse.  Thus, the agreement\r\ndoes not affect property which Texas law determines to be community.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Legal Principles</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Separate property consists of property owned or claimed before marriage, property acquired\r\nduring the marriage by gift, devise, or descent, recovery for personal injury, and property\r\ndesignated as such by agreement; all other property acquired during marriage is community\r\nproperty.  <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> §§ 5.01, 5.43, 5.52.  Property possessed by either spouse\r\nduring or on dissolution of a marriage is presumed to be community property.  <span>Tex. Fam.

App.—Waco 1991, writ denied).  The presumption can only be rebutted\r\nby clear and convincing evidence showing that specific assets are derived from a spouse's separate\r\nestate.  <i>Id</i>.  That is, the party asserting a separate-property interest in an asset has the burden of\r\n\"tracing\" the source of the asset from separate property to the specific asset.  <i>Id</i>.  When\r\ncommunity and separate property have been so commingled as to make segregation impossible,\r\nthe statutory presumption prevails, and all of the property is considered part of the community\r\nestate.  <i>McKinley v. McKinley</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1778865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1778865/mckinley-v-mckinley/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 543 (Tex. 1973). </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We apply legal- and factual-sufficiency standards of review to determine if the community-property presumption has been rebutted.  In determining whether legally-sufficient evidence rebuts\r\nthe presumption, we view the evidence in the light which tends to support the jury's findings and\r\ndisregard all evidence and inferences to the contrary.  <i>See Weirich v. Weirich</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2372648\"><a href=\"/opinion/2372648/weirich-v-weirich/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></a></span>,\r\n945 (Tex. 1992).  If there is no evidence or merely a scintilla of evidence to support the jury's\r\nfindings, we will sustain Sue's challenge.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes v. Welch Associates</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2376052\"><a href=\"/opinion/2376052/juliette-fowler-homes-inc-v-welch-associates-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></a></span>, 666 &amp; n.9 (Tex. 1990); <i>Kindred v.

In reviewing a factual-insufficiency claim, we consider all of the evidence and determine\r\nif the challenged finding is so against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence as to be\r\nmanifestly unjust.  <i>See Pool v.

Finally, when\r\nSue has the burden of proof on an issue, we use the \"matter of law\" standard of review.  <i>See</i>\r\n<i>Sterner v.

To sustain this burden, she must\r\nshow that there is no evidence supporting the finding and, then, that her contrary position has been\r\nestablished as a matter of law.  <i>See id.</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Characterization of Specific Assets</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Municipal Bonds</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Buffalo Airlines issued 100 shares of stock.

However, she claimed that they acquired the other\r\n60 shares during the marriage.  Larry conceded that he had acquired the 60 shares after marriage,\r\nbut contended that he had obtained them through gifts—40 from Buffalo and 20 from his father. \r\nIf true, 100% of the proceeds from the sale of Buffalo would potentially be covered by the\r\npremarital agreement because property acquired by gift during the course of the marriage is\r\nseparate property of the donee.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.01(a)(2).  However, Larry had\r\nthe burden to rebut the community-property presumption by clear and convincing evidence.  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837.  We\r\nconclude that he failed to carry this burden.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Prior to Larry's and Sue's marriage, Buffalo bought Lund's 40 shares and held them as\r\ntreasury stock.  Sue introduced Buffalo's corporate minutes, dated July 17, 1987, which reflected\r\nthat the board of directors had unanimously voted to \"pay Larry W. Walston a stock bonus of 40\r\nshares of Treasury Stock as a reward for the Company's fine performance last year.\"  Thus, Sue\r\nshowed that Larry obtained 40 shares as payment for his services to Buffalo after their marriage,\r\nestablishing that the 40 shares were community property.  <i>See Jensen v. Jensen</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1505703\"><a href=\"/opinion/1505703/jensen-v-jensen/\"><span class=\"volume\">665</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>,\r\n109 (Tex. 1984).  Although Larry claimed that he would adduce evidence to rebut these corporate\r\nminutes, the only evidence that he presented was his testimony.  We conclude that his testimony\r\nis a mere scintilla of evidence.  <i>See</i> <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, he failed to present\r\nsufficient evidence to rebut the community-property presumption regarding these 40 shares.  <i>See\r\nJuliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666 &amp; n.9; <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>,\r\n527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue claimed that she and Larry purchased M.D. Walston's 20 shares of stock for $75,000\r\nafter the sale of Buffalo.  She presented wire transfer receipts documenting two transfers to M.D.\r\nWalston, one of $30,000 and a second for $45,000.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Larry claimed that his father had given the\r\nstock to him.  However, the only evidence Larry provided was his testimony; he provide no\r\nobjective evidence showing that he received the stock as a gift from his father.  Again, we\r\nconclude that Larry provided only a scintilla of evidence that he obtained these 20 shares by gift. \r\n<i>See</i> <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, he failed to rebut the community presumption that attached\r\nwhen he acquired ownership of the shares after his marriage to Sue.  Therefore, these 20 shares\r\nwere also owned as part of the community estate.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666\r\n&amp; n.9; <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837. \r\nThus, we conclude that 40% of the proceeds of the sale of Buffalo Airlines was Larry's separate\r\nproperty at the time of the sale and the remaining 60% was owned by the community estate.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>As already noted, Buffalo Airlines sold for approximately $2 million.</span></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><span>  Although the sale\r\nclosed at the end of February 1989, the buyer began payments with a $100,000 cashier's check\r\non January 27, 1989, apparently deposited into an account held by Larry and Sue (the 202\r\naccount).  The buyer made two more cash payments that were wired into another (the 316 account)\r\njoint account—a $475,000 payment on February 28 and a $950,000 payment on March 2.  Finally,\r\non May 19 the buyer executed a promissory note for $224,000, payable to both Larry and Sue. \r\nThus, for the sale of Buffalo, they received $1.525 million in cash, of which $1.425 million was\r\ndeposited into the 316 joint account, and a $224,000 promissory note.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>After receipt of the last major payment, the parties began withdrawing funds from the 316\r\naccount.  On March 3 they paid a Buffalo debt from the account in the amount of $200,644.44\r\nand, on March 14, they paid a debt owed by Larry in the amount of $315,124.99.  Thus,\r\n$515,769.43 of the cash proceeds in the 316 account were immediately used to pay debts.  On the\r\nsame day as the second debt payment, March 14, Larry and Sue purchased $750,000 worth of\r\ncertificates of deposits, utilizing the money in this joint account.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue testified to these transactions, assisted by a ledger she prepared for trial.  She did not\r\nintroduce any bank statements or canceled checks to support her testimony, but did introduce the\r\nwire transfer receipts.  Wire transfer receipts for the February 28 and March 3 deposits are\r\nincluded in the record.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Larry testified about these transactions, too.  He introduced the January 27 cashier's check\r\nand a deposit slip for the 202 account, reflecting a $100,000 deposit on January 30.  He also\r\nintroduced the February statement from the 316 account, showing the $1.425 million in deposits\r\nand the withdrawals discussed above.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The CDs were purchased in both Larry's and Sue's name.  As the CDs matured, the funds\r\nwere either reinvested in other CDs or used to purchase the municipal bonds on hand at the end\r\nof the marriage.  Again, the municipal bonds were purchased in both of their names.  Sue's\r\nevidence indicated that the funds from the maturing CDs were actually redeposited into the 316\r\naccount just prior to being reinvested in the municipal bonds.  Larry testified, however, that the\r\nfunds went directly from the CDs into the municipal bonds.  According to Sue's testimony, the\r\nfirst bond purchase occurred on May 30.   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Neither party presented bank documents which would allow the fact-finder to actually trace\r\neach dollar's path from the purchase of Buffalo Airlines to the municipal bonds on hand at the\r\ndissolution of the marriage.  The documentary evidence the parties did supply showed that the 316\r\naccount received funds from other sources, for instance, a deposit on March 21, which the bank\r\nstatement indicates is an interest payment, and withdrawals for undetermined purposes.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Under Texas community-property law, the $1.425 million before its deposit in the 316\r\naccount belonged 60% ($855,000) to the community and 40% ($570,000) to Larry's separate\r\nestate.  After the money was deposited into the account, the premarital agreement legally\r\nrecharacterized the funds so that they were then owned 60% ($855,000) by the community, 20%\r\n($285,000) by Larry's separate estate, and 20% ($285,000) by Sue's separate estate.  Because the\r\n316 account contained both separate and community funds, a presumption applies that the first\r\nfunds withdrawn were community property.  <i>See Welder v. Welder</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437921\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437921/welder-v-welder/\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 433 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1990, no writ).  Thus, the $515,769.43 used to pay debts in March are\r\npresumed to be community funds, reducing the community share of the account to 32.8%\r\n($279,210.57), and increasing Larry's and Sue's separate-property portion to 33.6% each. \r\nBecause the next withdrawal from the account was the $750,000 to pay for CDs, the community\r\nshare of the account was exhausted, and the additional $470,789.43 used to purchase the $750,000\r\nin CDs came equally from the parties' separate funds in the account.  <i>See id</i>.; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d\r\nat 838.  Thus, the CDs, when purchased, were 37.2% community, 31.4% Larry's separate\r\nproperty, and 31.4% Sue's separate property.  <i>See Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 838.  The bonds\r\npurchased with the proceeds of the CDs were, then, at most, 31.4% Larry's separate property and\r\n31.4% Sue's separate property, with the community claiming at least 37.2% of the bonds' value.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>To preserve their separate-property interest in the bonds, either Larry or Sue had to trace the\r\nseparate assets used to purchase the CDs into the bonds.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02;\r\n<i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837.  However, neither one presented\r\nsufficient evidence to segregate the funds used to purchase the bonds into a community share and\r\na separate-property share.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650\r\nS.W.2d at 63.  We conclude that the funds were hopelessly commingled.  <i>See McKinley</i>, 496\r\nS.W.2d at 543.  Thus, the community-property presumption prevails, and those bonds, which\r\nwere purchased with money from the CDs and the 316 account, did not retain any separate-property character.  <i>See id</i>.  Any contrary conclusion by the jury or the court was not supported\r\nby the evidence.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d at 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at\r\n63.  Thus, the bonds listed as items number three through nine on jury question number one are\r\n100% community property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue conceded at trial that the El Paso County Junior College bonds and the City of Pearland\r\nbonds were purchased prior to her marriage to Larry.  Thus, by concession, they  are Larry's\r\nseparate property.  She admitted that she had no claim to the Pearland bonds.  She claimed,\r\nhowever, that Larry made a gift of one-half of the El Paso County Junior College bonds to her. \r\nTo sustain this claim, Sue had the burden of proving (1) Larry intended to make the gift, (2)\r\ndelivery of the property to her, and (3) her acceptance of the gift.  <i>See Powell</i>, 822 S.W.2d at 183. \r\nWe conclude that she failed to carry her burden of proof.  <i>See</i> <i>Sterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 690.  Thus,\r\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that the bonds listed as numbers 1 and 2\r\non jury question number one are 100% Larry's separate property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Vehicles</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The jury found that the car and one of the planes submitted in jury question number one, a\r\n1990 Cadillac and a 1970 Cessna 414, were 100% Larry's separate property.  The jury found that\r\nthe second plane, a 1967 Cessna 150, was 50% Larry's and 50% Sue's separate property.  The\r\ncourt again deviated from the jury's findings, awarding all three 20% to Sue and 80% to Larry. \r\nWe must examine the evidence to determine if the court's failure to enforce the premarital\r\nagreement resulted in a misharacterization of these assets.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue testified that the Cadillac was purchased with funds from the 316 joint account.  Larry\r\ntestified that \"a check was written directly for this car,\" without specifying which account the\r\nmoney came from.  However, he testified that \"the bond money came directly to my checking\r\naccount; and a check was written directly for this car.\"  Larry failed to identify which \"bonds\"\r\nwere the source of the funds.  Apart from Larry's vague testimony, neither party presented any\r\nevidence to rebut the community-property presumption.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d\r\nat 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, the Cadillac is properly characterized as 100%\r\ncommunity property.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02; <i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>,\r\n805 S.W.2d at 837.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Both Larry and Sue testified that the Cessna 414 was purchased immediately after the stock\r\nproceeds were deposited.  Sue put into evidence a canceled check, dated March 14, 1989,\r\nrepresenting the purchase price of the airplane.  This asset is directly traced to the 316 account\r\nafter the transactions involving the debt payments and CD purchases.  Thus, because the account\r\nhad been drained of community property prior to the purchase of the airplane, the Cessna 414 is\r\nproperly characterized by the terms of the premarital agreement as being 50% Larry's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Sue's separate property.  <i>See Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 838; <i>Welder</i>, 794 S.W.2d\r\nat 433.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The Cessna 150 was purchased in the summer of 1991.  Sue claimed that Larry bought the\r\nplane as a gift for her.  However, she did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate as a\r\nmatter of law that she obtained the plane as a gift.  <i>See</i> <i>Sterner</i>, 767 S.W.2d at 690; <i>Powell</i>, 822\r\nS.W.2d at 183.  Larry testified that he bought the plane with a $4,000 separate-property\r\n\"credit\"—<i>i.e.</i>, with money then owed to him by the plane's owner as a result of their business\r\ndealings—and $4,000 of \"family money.\"  Thus, Larry alleged that the airplane was 50% his\r\nseparate property and 50% community property.  However, he stated that the credit \"had\r\naccumulated over a year or so period.\"  Thus, the credit was acquired during his marriage to Sue\r\nand was presumptively a community asset.  Both Larry and Sue failed to present any evidence\r\nwhich would support the jury's finding that the airplane was 50% the separate property of each,\r\nnor evidence to support the court's judgment dividing ownership of the plane as 20% Sue's\r\nseparate property and 80% Larry's separate property.  <i>See Juliette Fowler Homes</i>, 793 S.W.2d\r\nat 666 &amp; n.9; <i>Kindred</i>, 650 S.W.2d at 63.  Thus, the community-property presumption prevails,\r\nand the Cessna 150 is 100% community property.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 5.02;\r\n<i>Cockerham</i>, 527 S.W.2d at 167; <i>Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 837.  <span>Chattels</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The \"chattels\" included in jury question one are items 14 through 25 (a computer, a\r\ntypewriter, three cellular telephones, airplane parts, a Pratt and Whitney PT6, a glass table with\r\nfour chairs, two wing chairs, two file cabinets, a band saw, a table saw, and scaffolding).  Larry\r\ntestified that these items were property of Buffalo Airlines and were not included in the company's\r\nsale.  He presented a letter from the buyer documenting that items 14 through 19 (the computer,\r\ntypewriter, three cellular telephones, airplane parts, and Pratt and Whitney PT6) were not being\r\ntransferred with the airline's assets.  Sue agreed with Larry's testimony.  Because these items were\r\ninitially the property of Buffalo Airlines but were conveyed to the parties by some method, the\r\nparties acquired ownership of the items during the course of their marriage.  Therefore, these\r\nitems are presumptively community property.  Neither party presented any evidence which tended\r\nto rebut this presumption.  <i>See id</i>.  Thus, the presumption prevails and these items are owned by\r\nthe community estate.  <i>See id</i>.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>Remaining items</span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Only two items in jury question number one have not been addressed:  item 13, a \"Note\r\nreceivable from Lifeline Partners LTD,\" and item 26, the gun collection.  Sue stated that the\r\nLifeline note derived from a failed contract between Buffalo Airlines and Lifeline.  When Buffalo\r\nwas sold, the note was excluded from the transaction and conveyed to Larry.  Larry concurred in\r\nSue's description of the source of this item.  Thus, like the chattels above, the Lifeline note was\r\nacquired from Buffalo Airline during the course of the marriage and, because neither party\r\npresented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption, is owned by the community.  <i>See id</i>. \r\nFinally, item 26 is a gun collection.  Sue conceded that Larry owned the collection before they\r\nwere married, but claimed that he spent approximately $10,000 in funds adding to it during the\r\nmarriage.  However, she does not challenge the court's awarding the collection to Larry as 100%\r\nhis separate property.  Thus, we will not consider the disposition of the gun collection in this\r\nappeal.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Disposition of Points Two, Four, Five, Six, Seven, and Eight</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>We hold that the evidence mandates the conclusion that the City of Lubbock, City of Austin,\r\nEast Central I.S.D., Marble Falls I.S.D., City of San Antonio, City of Rockport, and Ellis County\r\nWater bonds (items 3 through 9) are 100% community property.  Likewise, the Cadillac DeVille\r\n(item 10), the Cessna 150 (item 12), the Lifeline note (item 13), and the \"chattels\" (items 14\r\nthrough 25) are 100% community property.  The Cessna 414 (item 11) is 50% Larry's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Sue's separate property.  Finally, the El Paso County Junior College and the\r\nCity of Pearland bonds (items 1 and 2) are 100% Larry's separate property.  Because the court\r\ndeviated from these characterizations, its judgment is not supported by the evidence.  Likewise,\r\nthe jury's verdict is not supported by the evidence either. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The court's judgment divested Larry of 20% of his separate-property bonds and divested Sue\r\nof her separate-property interest in 30% of the Cessna 414.  Because such divestiture is\r\nimpermissible, we must reverse the court's judgment dividing these two assets.  <i>See Cameron v.\r\nCameron</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2440422\"><a href=\"/opinion/2440422/cameron-v-cameron/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 219 (Tex. 1982).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Of the $384,975 in assets in jury question number one, the court found that $307,980 was\r\nLarry's separate property and $76,995 was Sue's separate property.  As we have shown, the\r\nevidence supports only a finding that $75,000 belonged to Larry's separate estate, that $25,000\r\nbelonged to Sue's separate estate, and that $284,975 was owned as community property. \r\nMischaracterizing community assets as separate property does not necessarily result in reversal. \r\n<i>See Jacobs v. Jacobs</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1525528\"><a href=\"/opinion/1525528/jacobs-v-jacobs/\"><span class=\"volume\">687</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 733 (Tex. 1985); <i>Scott</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></span>.  Reversal is\r\nmandated only if the error has materially affected the court's \"just and right\" division of the\r\ncommunity estate.  <i>Id</i>.  When we seek to determine if the error had this effect, we can consider\r\nwhat division the court probably would have made if the property had been properly characterized. \r\n<i>See Scott</i>, 805 S.W.2d at 841-42.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>The court divided the assets characterized as community property at the trial 50% to Sue and\r\n50% to Larry.  Under the judgment the court rendered, the total community estate, as we have\r\ncharacterized it, is divided 64% to Larry and 36% to Sue.  Contrasted with the division of the\r\ncommunity estate at the court's disposal, we conclude that the error in failing to enforce the\r\npremarital agreement and rendering judgment unsupported by the evidence materially affected the\r\nproperty division.  <i>See id</i>.  Thus, points two, four, five, six, seven, and eight are sustained. \r\nBecause we have sustained these points, we will reverse the court's property division and remand\r\nthe property division to the trial court for redivision.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Division of the Debts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In point nine, Sue argues that the court abused its discretion in dividing the parties' debts. \r\nThe debts are part of the community estate, and the trial court is charged with dividing that estate\r\nin a \"just and right\" manner.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> § 3.63(a); <i>McKnight v.

We cannot reverse only a portion of the division\r\nof the community estate.  <i>See Jacobs</i>, 687 S.W.2d at 733.  We have found that the court's error\r\nin mischaracterizing the property of the parties affected the \"just and right\" division of the\r\ncommunity estate and will reverse the court's division.  <i>See id</i>.  When we remand the property\r\ndivision to the trial court, we necessarily remand the division of the debts.  Thus, point nine is\r\nsustained and the court's division of the parties' debts will also be reversed.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Payment of the Debts</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Finally, in her last two points in cause number 10-94-169-CV, Sue directly attacks the court's\r\njudgment.  She first claims in point ten that the court \"erred in its methodology\" by requiring that\r\nthe parties' debts be repaid immediately.  In point eleven, she asserts that the court erred by\r\nrequiring that she pay her general debts from the proceeds of the sale of her homestead.  However,\r\nbefore Sue can complain about the court's judgment on appeal, she must have brought the\r\ncomplaint to the trial court's attention.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. R.

Following entry of the final divorce decree, Sue\r\nfiled her cost bond but did not post a supersedeas bond.  Larry then instituted a partition suit,\r\nseeking to have the homestead sold so that its value could be divided according to the divorce\r\ndecree.  The court denied Sue's plea in abatement and appointed a receiver to sell the homestead. \r\nIn cause number 10-94-251-CV, Sue complains about that appointment.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>She argues in her first point that the court abused its discretion in appointing the receiver\r\nbecause the property was not in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex.\r\nCiv. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann.</span> § 64.001(b) (Vernon 1986).  In her second point she argues that\r\nthe court did not have jurisdiction to appoint the receiver.  <i>See</i> <span>Tex. Fam. Code Ann.</span> §\r\n3.58(h)(3).  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>During the pendency of cause number 10-94-251-CV, Sue filed three motions for leave to file\r\na petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking to prohibit the court from continuing with the\r\nreceivership.  We denied leave to file each time.  On February 1, 1995, the receiver sold the\r\nresidence.  By order dated February 15, the trial court discharged the receiver and closed the\r\nreceivership.  Our clerk notified the parties on March 28, 1995, that this appeal appeared to be\r\nmoot and subject to being dismissed unless one of them could show grounds for continuing it.  <i>See</i>\r\n<span>Tex. R. App. P.</span> 60(a)(2), 83.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>A cause is moot when there is no actual controversy between the parties or if the court's\r\naction on the merits cannot affect the rights of the parties.  <i>Texas Educ. Agency v. Leeper</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></span>, 441 (Tex. 1994); <i>VE Corp. v.

At\r\nthis time, the receivership has served its function and has been closed by the trial court; thus, there\r\nis no live controversy between Sue and Larry regarding the now nonexistent receivership.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because no controversy now exists between the parties, any opinion we may render on Sue's\r\nappeal of the receivership would constitute an advisory opinion.  <i>See General Land Office v. OXY\r\nU.S.A., Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1492533\"><a href=\"/opinion/1492533/general-land-office-of-the-state-of-tex-v-oxy-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span>, 570 (Tex. 1990).

In fact, we \"simply have no jurisdiction to render advisory\r\nopinions.\"  <i>See Speer</i>, 847 S.W.2d at 229.  Even if an issue remains as to costs, an appeal is\r\nnevertheless moot when the underlying controversy has ended.  <i>See Brownsville Sch.

App.—Waco 1985, no writ).   </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>In response to our clerk's letter of March 28, Sue filed a \"Motion to Continue Appeal.\"  She\r\nargues in the motion that the trial court acted without jurisdiction when it created the receivership\r\nand thus the acts of the receiver are void.  Thus, Sue argues, \"[i]f this appeal is heard and a\r\nfavorable ruling obtained by [her], then [she] should be able to set aside the void act of the\r\nReceiver conveying her interest in the residence.\"  However, she has not cited any authority to\r\nsupport her arguments in this motion.  </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Sue invites us to render an opinion on the validity of the court's order when such an opinion\r\nwould not be binding on the parties unless a subsequent, entirely new law suit is filed.  \"The\r\ndistinctive feature of an advisory opinion is that it decides an abstract question of law without\r\nbinding the parties.\"  <i>Texas Ass'n of Business v. Texas Air Control Bd.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515115\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515115/tex-assn-of-business-v-air-control-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></a></span>, 444\r\n(Tex. 1993).  Any ruling on Sue's claim that the court acted without jurisdiction would not bind\r\neither party to a course of action.  Sue might be able to set aside the sale of the house as an action\r\nbased on a void order.  However, this appeal involves the appointment of the receiver, not the sale\r\nof the house.  Any decision we might render on this cause would merely predict the outcome of\r\na possible future suit to set aside the receiver's deed under which the house was sold.  Under the\r\ncircumstances, we reject Sue's arguments regarding the viability of her appeal in cause number\r\n10-94-251-CV.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Because the controversy is moot, we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction over Sue's\r\nappeal from the order appointing a receiver for the sale of the parties' homestead.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>DISPOSITION</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>      </span>Having sustained Sue's points one, two, and four through nine in cause 10-94-169-CV, we\r\nsever the portion of the judgment declaring the parties separate property interests and dividing\r\ntheir community property, reverse the court's property disposition, and remand the community\r\nproperty portion of the cause back to the trial court for a just and right division in light of our\r\njudgment.  We render judgment, however, declaring that the Cessna 414 is 50% Larry's separate\r\nproperty and 50% Sue's separate property, and that the El Paso County Junior College and the\r\nCity of Pearland bonds are 100% Larry's separate property.  Otherwise, the judgment is affirmed. \r\nCause number 10-94-251-CV is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  All prior orders of this court\r\nin cause number 10-94-251-CV are vacated.</span></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>                                                                                 </span>BOB L.
