Mason, Jr., MASON & MASON, Newport News, Vir-\nginia, for Appellee.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\fUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nOPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nAppellant Circle Lanes, Inc. (\"Circle Lanes\") appeals the district\ncourt's order adopting the magistrate judge's recommendation and\ngranting Appellees' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\nFinding no reversible error, we affirm.\n\nCircle Lanes filed this action in Virginia state court. Appellees\ntimely removed the case to federal court and filed a joint motion to\ndismiss the case. The matter was referred to a magistrate judge. After\na hearing on the matter, the magistrate judge recommended granting\nthe motion. Following de novo review of those portions of the magis-\ntrate judge's report to which Circle Lanes objected, 28 U.S.C.\n§ 636(b)(1) (1988), the district court adopted the report and granted\nthe motion to dismiss.\n\nThis case arises from an article written by Appellee Ned Zeman\nand appearing in the October 25, 1993, issue of S PORTS ILLUSTRATED,\npublished by Appellee Time, Inc. The article was entitled Southern\nDiscomfort and recounted the events surrounding a fight in a bowling\nalley in Hampton, Virginia. The bowling alley is owned and operated\nby Circle Lanes. The incident was highly publicized with allegations\nthat it was racially motivated. The incident resulted in criminal con-\nvictions for four young black men, including Allen Iverson, a local\nhigh school athlete of national prominence.\n\nCircle Lanes filed suit against Zeman and Time, Inc., claiming that\nit had been harmed by false, libelous and defamatory statements in the\narticle. The alleged offensive language in the article is found in the\nfirst three paragraphs:\n\n          TO THE PEOPLE OF HAMPTON, VA., THE case of\n          Allen Iverson -- one of the greatest high school basketball\n\n                    2\n\f          stars the state has produced -- comes down to one odious\n          word: Nigger. It is among the most incendiary words in the\n          American vernacular, and by 1993 it was only occasionally\n          heard around town . . . . Black teenagers hardly ever heard\n          the word unless it was spoken by one of them. . . .\n\n          After last Feb. 13, however, everything changed. That\n          was when Iverson, then 17, and a bunch of friends-- . . . all\n          black--headed to Circle Lanes to bowl some games .. . .\n          The woman at the counter sent them to the end of the alley,\n          to a lane against the wall. To Michael Simmons, the tight\n          end who has been a pal of Iverson's since grade school, that\n          always seemed to happen. You boys, over there . . . .\n\n          When Iverson began thinking cheeseburger, more than\n          one friend offered to go with him to the snack bar on the\n          other side of the alley. Over by a group of white guys.\n\nNed Zeman, Southern Discomfort, SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, Oct. 25, 1993,\nat 46.\n\nCircle Lanes was named one other time in the article, in the second\nto last paragraph, which reads, \"Circle Lanes has changed its name,\nand its owner says business is off.\" However, Circle Lanes did not\nmention that statement in its complaint.\n\nTo sustain an action for libel in Virginia, the plaintiff must show:\n(1) publication; (2) an actionable statement; and (3) requisite intent.\nChapin v. Knight-Ridder, Inc., 993 F.2d 1087, 1092 (4th Cir. 1993).\nTo be actionable, a statement must \"`tend[ ] so to harm the reputation\nof another as to lower him in the estimation of the community or deter\nthird persons from associating or dealing with him.'\" Id. (quoting\nRestatement (Second) of Torts § 559). Merely offensive or unpleasant\nstatements are not defamatory. Id.\n\nThe magistrate judge properly found that the article did not attri-\nbute to Circle Lanes any improper conduct or motives, biased poli-\ncies, or mistreatment of customers. Thus, the magistrate judge\nconcluded that the language of the article is not actionable.\n\n                    3\n\fThe magistrate judge next looked to the conduct of the employee,\nwho was not named in the article. A plaintiff may not bring a defama-\ntion action unless the subject statements concern the plaintiff. General\nProducts Co. v. Meredith Corp., 526 F. Supp. 546, 550 (E.D. Va.\n1981). The only statement attributed to a Circle Lanes employee was,\n\"[t]he woman at the counter sent them to the end of the alley, to a lane\nagainst the wall.\" Looking at the plain and natural meaning of those\nwords, it is not apparent that there was any corporate policy of treat-\ning African-Americans differently from others on the basis of their\nrace. Therefore, the district court correctly held that Circle Lanes\nfailed to show actionable language.\n\nCircle Lanes asserts that the magistrate judge erred in his analysis\nof the facts of the case. Specifically, Circle Lanes believes that the\nimplied racial motive behind the lane assignment statement should be\nobvious to anyone. Circle Lanes also asserts that the plain and natural\nmeanings of the words used in the article are defamatory because an\nordinary reader would find them to be false statements which tend to\ninjure reputation. The district court found, however, that while the\narticle is \"an example of extremely poor journalism, it is not defama-\ntory.\" The bowling alley is mentioned by name only twice in the arti-\ncle and only in connection with the events of one evening. The district\ncourt found it implausible that one isolated encounter with an\nemployee could establish that Circle Lanes practiced segregation of\ncustomers or treated customers differently based upon their race. We\nagree with the district court. Moreover, the district court properly\nfound that the language in the article does not rise to the level of\nharming Circle Lanes' reputation to the extent required by Chapin.\n\nFinally, Circle Lanes objected to the relatively minor significance\nthat the magistrate judge attached to the issue of falsity of the state-\nments in the article. However, defamation law clearly holds that to\nstate an actionable claim, the statements must not only be false, but\nalso defamatory. Chapin, 993 F.2d at 1092. Because the district court\nproperly found that the statements are not defamatory, it did not err\nin declining to consider whether the statements were false.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court's order granting Appel-\nlees' motion to dismiss this action for failure to state a claim. We dis-\n\n                     4\n\fpense with oral argument upon Appellant's unopposed motion to\nsubmit the case on the briefs.\n\nAFFIRMED\n\n                   5\n\f\f",
