His parents, plaintiffs-appellants C.L. and G.W., placed\n\nhim in a specialized private school designed to educate children with learning\n\ndisabilities and sued the District for tuition reimbursement under the Individuals\n\nwith Disabilities Education Act (the \"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. An\n\nImpartial Hearing Officer (\"IHO\") awarded tuition reimbursement to C.L.'s\n\nparents, holding that the District denied C.L. a FAPE and that the parents'\n\nprivate placement was appropriate. A State Review Officer (\"SRO\") reversed,\n\nagreeing that C.L. was denied a FAPE but holding that the parents' private\n\nplacement was not appropriate, at least in part because the specialized private\n\nschool was a more restrictive environment than the public school in which C.L.\n\nhad been placed. The district court affirmed.\n\n             We reverse. We hold that the SRO's decision was insufficiently\n\nreasoned to merit deference and we instead defer to the IHO's decision, which\n\nwas more thorough and carefully considered. The IHO detailed the programs\n\nthat the parents' placement provided to C.L. and the progress C.L. made there.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fThe IHO also took into account the school's restrictiveness as one factor in his\n\ndecision. In contrast, the SRO did not examine the kind of education and\n\nservices the parents' placement provided C.L., effectively ruling that the school\n\nwas inappropriate only because it was more restrictive than the public school he\n\npreviously attended. When a public school district, however, denies a child with\n\na disability a FAPE, a private placement is not inappropriate merely because the\n\nenvironment is more restrictive than the public school alternative. When a child\n\nis denied a FAPE, his parents may turn to an appropriate specialized private\n\nschool designed to meet special needs, even if the school is more restrictive.\n\n             The parents also brought a claim under Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794, alleging that\n\nthe District discriminated against C.L. on account of his disability. The district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment dismissing the claim, concluding that the\n\nparents had not presented sufficient evidence of bad faith or gross misjudgment.\n\nWe affirm the dismissal of the Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f                                  BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Legal Background\n\n             The IDEA seeks to provide to all children with disabilities \"a free\n\nappropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related\n\nservices.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1400(d)(1)(A); see Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch.\n\nDist., Westchester Cnty. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 181 (1982) (interpreting\n\npredecessor statute to IDEA, Education of the Handicapped Act). States\n\nreceiving federal funding must provide children with disabilities with a FAPE\n\n\"tailored to meet the unique needs of a particular child.\" Walczak v. Fla. Union\n\nFree Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). A FAPE must\n\nalso reflect the IDEA's \"'strong preference' for educating disabled students\n\nalongside their non-disabled peers; that is, in their least restrictive environment.\"\n\nM.W. ex rel. S.W. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 725 F.3d 131, 143 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing\n\nWalczak, 142 F.3d at 122).\n\n             The IDEA requires states to create an individualized education\n\nprogram (\"IEP\") for each disabled child. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(4); see also Honig\n\nv. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311 (1988) (describing development of IEP as \"centerpiece\" of\n\nIDEA); Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ., 459 F.3d 356, 363 (2d Cir. 2006) (describing IEP as\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f\"[t]he key element of the IDEA\"). The IEP is \"a written statement that sets out the\n\nchild's present educational performance, establishes annual and short-term\n\nobjectives for improvements in that performance, and describes the specially\n\ndesigned instruction and services that will enable the child to meet those\n\nobjectives.\" D.D. ex rel. V.D. v. N.Y.C. Bd. of Educ., 465 F.3d 503, 507-08 (2d Cir.\n\n2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(1)(A). The\n\nIEP must be reviewed at least annually and revised in accordance with the child's\n\nneeds. 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(2), (3), (4).\n\n             Where the state fails to provide a FAPE to a disabled child, the\n\nparents may enroll the child in a private school and seek reimbursement for the\n\ncost of the private school education from the local education agency. See\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(10)(C)(i), (ii); Sch. Comm. of Town of Burlington, Mass. v. Dep't\n\nof Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 370 (1985); Frank G., 459 F.3d at 363. In New York, which is\n\ncovered by the IDEA, a parent seeking such reimbursement must first pursue\n\nthat claim in a due process hearing before an IHO, N.Y. Educ. Law § 4404(1)\n\n(McKinney 2006), and may appeal an adverse ruling to an SRO, id. § 4404(2).\n\nEither party may then seek review of the SRO's decision in federal court.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f             Parents may also seek relief under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a), where their child has been subjected to discrimination on\n\naccount of her disabilities in any program receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nAs we have noted, \"[t]he purposes of the Rehabilitation Act are similar to that of\n\nthe IDEA.\" Muller ex rel. Muller v. Comm. on Special Educ. of E. Islip Union Free Sch.\n\nDist., 145 F.3d 95, 99 n.2 (2d Cir. 1998). There are, however, differences in the\n\ntwo statutes, and an accommodation developed to comply with the\n\nRehabilitation Act is \"not an adequate substitute\" for an IEP under the IDEA. Id.\n\nat 105 & n.9; accord R.B. ex rel. F.B. v. Napa Valley Unified Sch. Dist., 496 F.3d 932,\n\n946 (9th Cir. 2007). An individual aggrieved by a violation of the Rehabilitation\n\nAct may seek, inter alia, compensatory damages. 29 U.S.C. § 794a.\n\nB.    The Facts\n\n             The relevant facts are largely undisputed. C.L. has been diagnosed\n\nwith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\"), nonverbal learning\n\ndisability, and executive function weakness. He has exhibited problems with\n\nanxiety, stuttering, fine motor development, and visual motor coordination, all of\n\nwhich inhibit his ability to learn. From the 2004-05 school year to the 2007-08\n\nschool year -- kindergarten to third grade -- C.L. attended Greenacres Elementary\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fSchool, a public school in Scarsdale, New York, operated by the District. During\n\nthe fourth year, the 2007-08 school year, C.L.'s parents requested that C.L. be\n\nconsidered for an IEP under the IDEA. After the District determined that he was\n\nnot entitled to an IEP, the parents enrolled C.L. at the Eagle Hill School, a\n\nspecialized private school in Greenwich, Connecticut, for the 2008-09 school year.\n\n      1.     The First Three Years at Greenacres\n\n             In October 2004, in kindergarten, C.L. began receiving speech-\n\nlanguage therapy sessions once a week to address his \"episodic dy[sfl]uency.\" In\n\nJanuary 2005, he began receiving pre-reading instruction sessions twice a week\n\nin Greenacres's Learning Resources Center (\"LRC\").1 An occupational therapy\n\nevaluation in March 2005 noted C.L.'s \"delays in fine motor development and\n\nvisual motor coordination, which [were] impacting [ ] his ability to perform\n\nclassroom tasks, such as writing and using scissors.\"\n\n             In March 2005, the District convened a committee pursuant to\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (the \"504 Committee\") to consider whether\n\nC.L. was disabled within the meaning of the statute and, if so, to recommend a\n\n\n\n      1\n             The LRC at Greenacres provides small-group academic support services\nto students with significant delays in their academic development.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcourse of action. The 504 Committee determined that C.L. was eligible for\n\nservices under the Rehabilitation Act and thus prepared a Section 504\n\nAccommodation Plan (the \"504 Plan\"). The 504 Plan recommended that C.L. be\n\nremoved from class for thirty minutes once weekly for occupational therapy\n\nsessions in a 1:1 student-to-teacher ratio setting.\n\n             The 504 Committee reconvened in October 2005 and October 2006 to\n\nplan for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years, respectively. Noting C.L.'s\n\ndifficulties with writing, remembering routines, and sustaining attention, the\n\n2005-06 504 Plan recommended: the continuation of the once weekly\n\nspeech-language therapy sessions in a 5:1 setting; an increase of the LRC sessions\n\nto four times a week in a 6:1 setting; and an increase of the occupational therapy\n\nsessions to twice weekly in one 1:1 setting and one 4:1 setting. The 2006-07 504\n\nPlan observed that \"[C.L.'s] reading ha[d] improved,\" but his \"level of disfluency\n\nha[d] increased . . . [to] stuttering\" and he had begun to exhibit anxiety in the\n\nclassroom. The 2006-07 504 Plan called for C.L. to continue largely the same\n\nservices as the previous school year, except that the twice weekly occupational\n\ntherapy sessions were now both in 1:1 settings.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f             In April 2007, a private occupational therapy evaluation arranged by\n\nC.L.'s parents placed C.L. in the twelfth percentile in visual-motor integration,\n\nsecond percentile in visual perception, first percentile in motor coordination, and\n\nsixth percentile in total motor composite. In May 2007, C.L.'s parents arranged\n\nfor private occupational therapy sessions for him and consequently informed the\n\nDistrict that he would no longer be receiving occupational therapy at Greenacres.\n\n             C.L.'s parents also arranged for the Soifer Center to conduct an\n\nindependent psychoeducational evaluation of C.L., which took place over the\n\ncourse of six days in April and May 2007. The Soifer Center's evaluation placed\n\nC.L.'s \"intellectual functioning within the upper end of the Low Average range.\"\n\nThe evaluation found, however, that C.L.'s language and executive functioning\n\nabilities were weak, and that his reading and mathematical skills were also\n\nlimited. Alarmed by this evaluation, C.L.'s parents requested that the 504\n\nCommittee reconvene.\n\n             On June 6, 2007, two days after the parents' conference with the\n\nSoifer Center about their child, the 504 Committee amended C.L.'s 504 Plan. The\n\namended 504 Plan noted that \"[a]lthough [C.L.] has made overall progress this\n\nyear both in class and in the LRC, his teacher corroborates the findings of the\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f[Soifer Center] evaluation.\" The 504 Plan acknowledged that C.L. fidgeted and\n\noften required refocusing and reteaching of new concepts when he was in a large\n\nclassroom setting, but noted that he had less trouble remaining on task in the\n\nsmaller learning environment of the LRC. The 504 Plan was amended to add \"15\n\nhours of classroom aide time [per week] . . . to assist [C.L.] with his organization\n\nand execution of writing tasks,\" as well as various program and testing\n\nmodifications.\n\n             After the end of the 2006-07 school year, C.L.'s parents sought a\n\n\"second opinion\" on the results of the Soifer Center evaluation and arranged for a\n\nneurodevelopmental evaluation of C.L. by Dr. Marilyn C. Agin. After examining\n\nC.L. in June 2007, Dr. Agin found that he had an early history of dyspraxia,\n\nwhich caused him to suffer from \"weaknesses in attention, organization and\n\nsequencing; handwriting difficulties; and language processing difficulties.\" She\n\nalso expressed concern about C.L.'s emotional well-being and self-esteem.\n\nAlthough Dr. Agin largely concurred with the recommendations of the 504 Plan\n\ncreated at Greenacres, she nonetheless \"strongly urged that [C.L.'s] parents\n\ninvestigate a private educational setting with an expertise in teaching children\n\nwith attentional and learning issues.\"\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f      2.     The Fourth Year at Greenacres\n\n             In October 2007, at the beginning of C.L.'s fourth year at Greenacres,\n\nthe 504 Committee met and made no changes to the amended 504 Plan for\n\n2007-08. In November 2007, a month after the 504 Committee created the 2007-08\n\n504 Plan, C.L.'s parents requested a review by the District's Committee on Special\n\nEducation (\"CSE\") to determine whether C.L. was entitled under the IDEA to\n\nspecial education services, including the development of an IEP.2 The parents\n\nprovided the CSE with the private evaluations of C.L., and the CSE conducted its\n\nown classroom observation, speech-language evaluation, and standardized\n\ntesting of C.L., along with a developmental history interview of the parents.\n\n             The speech-language evaluation indicated that C.L. was consistently\n\nperforming \"in the average to significantly above average range.\" On the\n\nStanford Diagnostic Reading Test, C.L. scored in the 82nd, 92nd, and 43rd\n\npercentiles in phonetic analysis, vocabulary, and comprehension respectively.\n\nOn the first administration of the Stanford Diagnostic Mathematics Test, C.L.\n\nscored in the 9th and 3rd percentiles in concepts and applications and in\n\n\n\n      2\n             New York assigns responsibility for fulfilling the state's obligations under\nthe IDEA to local Committees on Special Education. N.Y. Educ. Law § 4402(1)(b)(1)(a)\n(McKinney 1999); see also Walczak, 142 F.3d at 123.\n                                          -12-\n\fcomputations respectively, but the test administrator believed those scores did\n\nnot reflect C.L.'s abilities because he was not concentrating. The second\n\nadministration a few days later placed C.L. in the 38th and 84th percentiles in\n\nconcepts and applications and in computations respectively.\n\n            After reviewing the private and District evaluations of C.L., the CSE\n\nconcluded on January 8, 2008, that C.L. was not disabled under the IDEA and\n\nthat he therefore was not eligible for special education services or an IEP. The\n\nCSE determined, however, that C.L. remained eligible for services and\n\naccommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The CSE added\n\nthat, \"[s]ince [C.L.'s] reading skills have improved, committee members would\n\nlike to reduce his time in the LRC to two periods per week, to address his writing\n\nskills.\" In reaching these conclusions, the CSE acknowledged, as the parents\n\ncontended, that C.L. had \"become increasingly resistant to attending the LRC . . .\n\n[and] fe[lt] stigmatized by having to leave the classroom to attend the LRC for\n\nfour periods per week.\"\n\n             In May 2008, the 504 Committee convened to begin planning for\n\nC.L.'s fourth grade year. The 2008-09 504 Plan continued the services C.L. was\n\nalready receiving. As suggested by the CSE, however, C.L.'s LRC sessions were\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\freduced from four to two times a week. Dissatisfied with the progress he was\n\nmaking, C.L.'s parents informed the District on June 19, 2008, that they were\n\nwithdrawing C.L. from Greenacres and enrolling him at the Eagle Hill School.\n\n      3.    The 2008-09 School Year at Eagle Hill\n\n            The Eagle Hill School is a private school for children with\n\ndisabilities. The school educates children with language-based learning\n\ndisabilities, approximately half of whom also have attention disorders. In\n\ndetermining whether to admit C.L., Eagle Hill reviewed his educational records,\n\ninterviewed his parents, and observed him in a two-day visit during which he\n\nwas paired with a current student. Eagle Hill teachers evaluated C.L. to\n\ndetermine his cognitive potential, learning style, and academic strengths and\n\nneeds, and considered whether he would benefit from the Eagle Hill program.\n\n            C.L. was admitted and assigned an advisor who met with him daily\n\nto \"coordinate[] and oversee[] [his] academic program,\" and to help him with\n\n\"goal setting, communication among the staff, communication between teaching\n\nstaff and specialists, [and] communication between school and home.\"\n\n            Eagle Hill employs a \"diagnostic teaching model where teachers are\n\nconstantly, on a daily basis, assessing a child's progressed goal and making\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fadjustments based on that assessment, tailoring accommodations to the child's\n\nlearning style.\" Class sizes at Eagle Hill are tailored to the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the individual students, and children with similar learning styles\n\nare assigned to the same classes. C.L. was placed in a 3:1 ratio language arts\n\ntutorial class for two periods daily to assist with his reading, comprehension,\n\nwriting, and study skills. For math, history, writing, literature, and modeling,\n\nC.L. was placed in classes ranging from five to nine students in each class.\n\n             C.L.'s progress reports at Eagle Hill, issued in December 2008 and\n\nJune 2009, show that he made progress in all subject areas. C.L. also became\n\nmore active and enthusiastic over the school year, and was better able to express\n\nhis ideas and work independently.\n\nC.    Proceedings Below\n\n      1.     Administrative Proceedings\n\n             On June 5, 2009, C.L.'s parents requested a due process hearing\n\nbefore an IHO to seek reimbursement of the tuition that they paid to Eagle Hill.\n\nThe IHO concluded that at least by the third grade, if not before, C.L. was\n\nreceiving such \"a substantial array of test modifications, classroom\n\naccommodations, special education services and related services\" that the District\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fwas obligated to evaluate him under the IDEA. The IHO further determined that\n\nthe District should have classified C.L. as disabled under the IDEA, which would\n\nhave entitled him to special education services and the creation of an IEP. The\n\nIHO ruled that, by failing to provide an IEP for C.L., the District denied him a\n\nFAPE. The IHO also concluded that the 504 Plan proposed by the District for the\n\n2008-09 school year was not an appropriate substitute for an IEP because, among\n\nother things, the 504 Plan recommended a general education class that was too\n\nlarge. The IHO also held that the parents' private placement was appropriate\n\nunder the IDEA, highlighting the various services Eagle Hill offered C.L. and\n\nnoting the \"significant progress\" C.L. made during the 2008-09 school year. The\n\nIHO then weighed the equities and found no reason to deny tuition\n\nreimbursement.\n\n            On appeal, the SRO found error in the IHO's decision. Although the\n\nSRO agreed that C.L. was indeed denied a FAPE, he concluded that the parents\n\nfailed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the private placement they\n\nchose for C.L. was appropriate under the IDEA. In the SRO's view, there was\n\nevidence in the record that C.L. \"made progress\" at Greenacres, and consequently\n\n\"[C.L.] did not require a special education environment such as Eagle Hill, which\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fprovided no opportunity for the student to interact with nondisabled peers.\"\n\nThe SRO then concluded: \"When considering the restrictiveness of the parental\n\nplacement, under the facts of the instant case, I conclude that the parents are not\n\nentitled to an award of tuition reimbursement based on the restrictiveness of\n\nEagle Hill.\" The SRO did not discuss any of the specific services provided at\n\nEagle Hill other than to observe that C.L. was not receiving occupational therapy\n\nat Eagle Hill.\n\n      2.     The District Court\n\n             C.L.'s parents filed suit in the district court seeking to have the SRO's\n\ndecision reversed. They also added a claim under Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act, arguing that the District had discriminated against C.L. on\n\naccount of his disabilities. The district court determined that the SRO's decision\n\nwas entitled to deference because there was evidence supporting the SRO's\n\nconclusions that C.L. made progress at Greenacres and that he benefited from\n\ninteractions with his peers. C.L. v. Scarsdale Union Free Sch. Dist., 913 F. Supp. 2d\n\n26, 36-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). The district court also found no evidence of bad faith\n\nor deliberate indifference, as required to establish a Rehabilitation Act claim. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fat 40-41. Consequently, the district court granted the District's cross-motion for\n\nsummary judgment as to both claims.\n\n              This appeal followed.\n\n                                     DISCUSSION\n\n              We address the IDEA and Rehabilitation Act claims in turn.\n\nA.     The IDEA Claim\n\n       1.     Applicable Law\n\n              a.     Standard for Tuition Reimbursement under the IDEA\n\n              Where a school district denies a disabled child a FAPE, the parents\n\nmay place the child in an appropriate private school and then seek tuition\n\nreimbursement from the school district. See Burlington, 471 U.S. at 370; Florence\n\nCnty. Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 12-13 (1993). The parents\n\nbear the burden of showing that the private placement they selected was\n\nappropriate for the child and that the equities weigh in their favor. R.E. v.\n\nN.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 694 F.3d 167, 184-85 (2d Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct.\n\n2802 (2013); M.S. ex rel. S.S. v. Bd. of Educ. of the City Sch. Dist. of Yonkers, 231 F.3d\n\n96, 104 (2d Cir. 2000) , abrogated in part on other grounds, Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S.\n\n49 (2005).\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\f             The parents' placement of the child must be \"'reasonably calculated\n\nto enable the child to receive educational benefits,'\" Frank G., 459 F.3d at 364\n\n(quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 207), such that the placement is \"likely to produce\n\nprogress, not regression,\" id. (quoting Walczak, 142 F.3d at 133). Progress may be\n\ndemonstrated by grades, test scores, regular advancement, or other objective\n\nevidence, but no single factor is dispositive as \"courts assessing the propriety of a\n\nunilateral placement [must] consider the totality of the circumstances in\n\ndetermining whether that placement reasonably serves a child's individual\n\nneeds.\" Id. An inquiry into the appropriateness of a private placement is thus a\n\nsearch for indicators that \"the placement provides 'educational instruction\n\nspecially designed to meet the unique needs of a [disabled] child, supported by\n\nsuch services as are necessary to permit the child to benefit from instruction.'\" Id.\n\nat 365 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S. at 188-89).\n\n             This case presents the issues of whether and, if so, to what extent a\n\nparents' private placement must take into account the IDEA's \"strong preference\n\nfor 'mainstreaming,' or educating children with disabilities '[t]o the maximum\n\nextent appropriate' alongside their non-disabled peers.\" Grim v. Rhinebeck Cent.\n\nSch. Dist., 346 F.3d 377, 379 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)).\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f              With respect to the first issue, we have held that restrictiveness is a\n\nfactor in the parents' choice of private placement, for it remains the case that the\n\nIDEA maintains a \"strong preference\" for educating disabled children in the least\n\nrestrictive environment. Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122. We have recognized that the\n\n\"IDEA's requirement that an appropriate education be in the mainstream to the\n\nextent possible . . . remains a consideration that bears upon a parent's choice of\n\nan alternative placement and may be considered by the hearing officer in\n\ndetermining whether the placement was appropriate.\" M.S., 231 F.3d at 105\n\n(citing 20 U.S.C. § 1412(5)(B)). 3 We held in M.S. that the SRO's conclusion that\n\nthe private placement was inappropriate was supportable, and thus we reversed\n\nthe district court's conclusion otherwise. Id.\n\n              With respect to the second issue, the extent to which the\n\nrestrictiveness of a private placement is a consideration in the appropriateness\n\ninquiry, we note the following:\n\n\n\n\n       3\n               Other circuits have taken a perhaps broader approach. See, e.g., Cleveland\nHeights-Univ. Heights City Sch. Dist. v. Boss ex rel. Boss, 144 F.3d 391, 400 (6th Cir. 1998)\n(\"we hold that the failure of the [school] to satisfy the IDEA's mainstreaming\nrequirement does not bar the [parents] from receiving reimbursement\"); Warren G. v.\nCumberland Cnty. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 80, 83-84 (3d Cir. 1999); C.B. ex rel. B.B. v. Special\nSch. Dist. No. 1, Minneapolis, Minn., 636 F.3d 981, 991 (8th Cir. 2011).\n                                             -20-\n\f             First, parents \"are not barred from reimbursement where a private\n\nschool they choose does not meet the IDEA definition of a free appropriate\n\npublic education.\" Frank G., 459 F.3d at 364 (citing 20 U.S.C. § 1401(9)); see also\n\nCarter, 510 U.S. at 12-14 (observing that a number of IDEA provisions -- including\n\nthose requiring education of disabled children under public supervision and the\n\ncreation of IEPs designed by local educational agencies -- \"do not make sense in\n\nthe context of a parental placement\").\n\n             Second, along the same lines, \"parents . . . may not be subject to the\n\nsame mainstreaming [or LRE] requirements as a school board.\" M.S., 231 F.3d at\n\n105 (citing Warren G. v. Cumberland Cnty. Sch. Dist., 190 F.3d 80, 84 (3d Cir. 1999));\n\nsee also Frank G., 459 F.3d at 364. As the Fourth Circuit has pointed out, the\n\nIDEA's LRE requirement \"was aimed at preventing schools from segregating\n\n[disabled] students from the general student body,\" but not necessarily \"to\n\nrestrict parental options when the public schools fail to comply with the\n\nrequirements of the [IDEA].\" Carter ex rel, Carter v. Florence Cnty. Sch. Dist. Four,\n\n950 F.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir. 1991) (citing H.R. Rep. No. 94-332 (1975)), aff'd, 510\n\nU.S. 7 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f             Third, parents whose children are denied a FAPE may be and often\n\nare forced to turn to specialized private schools that educate only disabled\n\nchildren. Such private schools are necessarily restrictive as they do not educate\n\ndisabled and nondisabled children together, and may be more restrictive than\n\nthe public school from which the child was removed. Inflexibly requiring that\n\nthe parents secure a private school that is nonrestrictive, or at least as\n\nnonrestrictive as the FAPE-denying public school, would undermine the right of\n\nunilateral withdrawal the Supreme Court recognized in Burlington. See 471 U.S.\n\nat 370; see also Boss, 144 F.3d at 400 (noting Congress did not intend for a parent\n\nto choose between, on the one hand, letting child remain in FAPE-denying public\n\nschool, and, on the other hand, removing child to specialized private school\n\nwithout tuition reimbursement merely because specialized private school is more\n\nrestrictive than FAPE-denying public school).\n\n             Finally, \"the test for the parents' private placement is that it is\n\nappropriate, and not that it is perfect.\" Warren G., 190 F.3d at 84.\n\n             Hence, while the restrictiveness of a private placement is a factor, by\n\nno means is it dispositive. See Sumter Cnty. Sch. Dist. 17 v. Heffernan ex rel. TH,\n\n642 F.3d 478, 488 (4th Cir. 2011) (\"[W]hile a parental placement is not\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\finappropriate simply because it does not meet the least-restrictive-environment\n\nrequirement, it is nonetheless proper for a court to consider the restrictiveness of\n\nthe private placement as a factor when determining the appropriateness of the\n\nplacement.\" (emphasis in original)). Restrictiveness may be relevant in choosing\n\nbetween two or more otherwise appropriate private placement alternatives, or in\n\nconsidering whether a private placement would be more restrictive than\n\nnecessary to meet the child's needs, but where the public school system denied\n\nthe child a FAPE, the restrictiveness of the private placement cannot be\n\nmeasured against the restrictiveness of the public school option.\n\n             b.    Standards of Review\n\n             We review de novo a district court's decision to grant summary\n\njudgment on an IDEA claim. R.E., 694 F.3d at 184.\n\n             In considering an IDEA claim, a district court \"must engage in an\n\nindependent review of the administrative record and make a determination\n\nbased on a preponderance of the evidence.\" Gagliardo v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist.,\n\n489 F.3d 105, 112 (2d Cir. 2007) (quotation marks omitted); see also 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); R.E., 694 F.3d at 184. The obligation to independently review\n\nthe record, however, \"is by no means an invitation to the courts to substitute\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\ftheir own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities\n\nwhich they review.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 206. Federal courts \"lack the specialized\n\nknowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions\n\nof educational policy.\" Id. at 208 (quotation marks omitted). Consequently,\n\ndistrict courts must accord deference to state administrative agencies when\n\nreviewing their IDEA decisions. See Gagliardo, 489 F.3d at 112-13; see also Cerra v.\n\nPawling Cent. Sch. Dist., 427 F.3d 186, 191 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"In reviewing the\n\nadministrative proceedings, it is critical to recall that IDEA's statutory scheme\n\nrequires substantial deference to state administrative bodies on matters of\n\neducational policy.\"). The deference owed, however, is not absolute as it \"will\n\nhinge on the kinds of considerations that normally determine whether any\n\nparticular judgment is persuasive, for example whether the decision being\n\nreviewed is well-reasoned, and whether it was based on substantially greater\n\nfamiliarity with the evidence and the witnesses than the reviewing court.\" M.H.\n\nv. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., 685 F.3d 217, 244 (2d Cir. 2012).\n\n             Finally, as a general matter, \"[w]hen an IHO and SRO reach\n\nconflicting conclusions, we defer to the final decision of the state authorities, that\n\nis, the SRO's decision.\" R.E., 694 F.3d at 189 (internal quotations marks and\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\falterations omitted). Where the SRO's decision, however, is \"insufficiently\n\nreasoned to merit that deference\" and the IHO's decision is \"more thorough and\n\ncarefully considered,\" the reviewing court may consider and defer to the IHO's\n\ndecision. Id. at 189 (alteration omitted) (quoting M.H., 685 F.3d at 246); accord\n\nC.F. ex rel. R.F. v. N.Y.C. Dep't of Educ., No. 11-5003-cv, 2014 WL 814884, at *5 (2d\n\nCir. Mar. 4, 2014).\n\n      2.     Application\n\n             Both the IHO and SRO found that C.L. was denied a FAPE because\n\nhe should have been classified as a student with a disability who was eligible for\n\nspecial education services under the IDEA. The District does not challenge these\n\nfindings. Hence, the questions presented are (a) whether C.L.'s placement at\n\nEagle Hill was appropriate, and, if so, (b) whether the equities weigh in favor of\n\nC.L. and his parents. We address both questions in turn.\n\n             a.       The Appropriateness of the Placement at Eagle Hill\n\n             We conclude that the SRO's decision that the placement at Eagle Hill\n\nwas not appropriate is not entitled to the deference ordinarily accorded to state\n\nadministrative IDEA decisions. The SRO's decision was not sufficiently reasoned\n\nor carefully considered because the SRO did not consider or comment on any of\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fthe specific services provided to C.L. at Eagle Hill or the progress that the record\n\nshows he made at the school. Instead, we defer to the IHO's decision, which was\n\nmore thorough and carefully considered. The IHO discussed in detail Eagle\n\nHill's services and C.L.'s progress there.\n\n             The SRO did not discuss the particulars of the Eagle Hill program or\n\nwhether its services were appropriate for C.L.'s needs, other than to note that\n\nEagle Hill did not provide occupational therapy services. C.L. was receiving\n\nthose services privately anyway, and his parents were not required in any event\n\nto prove that the \"private placement furnishes every special service necessary.\"\n\nFrank G., 459 F.3d at 365.\n\n             In contrast, the IHO examined the specifics of the education C.L.\n\nreceived at Eagle Hill. The IHO initially noted Dr. Agin's private\n\nneurodevelopmental evaluation of C.L., which recommended that he be placed\n\nin a private school that specializes in educating learning-disabled children. The\n\nIHO then considered Eagle Hill's curriculum, describing it as \"researched based\n\nand individualized for each student,\" explaining that \"[a] diagnostic model is\n\nused in which a student's progress is assessed on a daily basis and adjustments\n\nmade as needed.\" The IHO also discussed how, before Eagle Hill admitted C.L.,\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f\"his educational records were reviewed, parents were interviewed and a two day\n\nvisit to the school by the student took place,\" after which the teachers who\n\ninstructed C.L. participated with an admissions team in determining C.L.'s\n\nappropriateness for Eagle Hill. The IHO found \"that such a process is likely to\n\nresult in an appropriate placement.\"\n\n             The IHO also delved into the specifics of C.L.'s classes, recounting\n\nhow \"C.L. received a tutorial class two periods per day with three students\n\ninstructed by a special education teacher specifically aimed at remediating the\n\nstudent's weaknesses in written expression and study skills, areas of significant\n\nneed for C.L.\" That tutorial class, the IHO found \"was a particularly appropriate\n\nprogram for C.L.\" The IHO also discussed C.L.'s small class sizes at Eagle Hill:\n\nfive to eight students for math and history, nine for literature, and seven for\n\nwriting. For that writing class, the IHO explained that \"modeling and other\n\nspecial strategies were used for instruction\" because it was an \"area of substantial\n\ndeficit for C.L.\"\n\n             Moreover, the IHO related how \"[i]n addition to small class\n\ninstruction using individualized teaching strategies and a daily tutorial period in\n\nareas of significant difficulty, Eagle Hill provided C.L. with an advisor who met\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fwith the student daily, observed him in class, and participated in weekly staff\n\nmeetings regarding the student.\" None of this was so much as mentioned by the\n\nSRO. The SRO could not diligently consider whether Eagle Hill was appropriate\n\nwithout assessing what the school had to offer.\n\n             The SRO likewise did not examine C.L.'s progress at Eagle Hill, as\n\nreflected in progress reports, standardized test results, and year-end letters to his\n\nparents. The IHO, by comparison, found that \"C.L. plainly made significant\n\nprogress at Eagle Hill during the 2008/09 school year.\" Citing C.L.'s progress\n\nreports and the testimony of Eagle Hill's Director of Admissions, the IHO\n\nexplained: \"He became enthusiastic about attending school, more confident as a\n\nlearner, [and] better able to express himself and work independently.\" The IHO\n\nalso noted that C.L.'s parent believed Eagle Hill had made C.L. \"more\n\nindependent and confident with less anxiety and better able to make friends.\"\n\nAgain, none of this was mentioned by the SRO.\n\n             By not taking into consideration Eagle Hill's services or C.L.'s\n\nprogress, the SRO improperly gave dispositive weight to the restrictiveness of\n\nEagle Hill in reaching the conclusion that it was inappropriate for C.L. The SRO\n\ndetermined that, because C.L. was making progress in Greenacres's\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fnonrestrictive general education classrooms with supports and services, Eagle\n\nHill's restrictive program was not the least restrictive environment in which C.L.\n\ncould obtain an appropriate education.4 In effect, the SRO ruled Eagle Hill\n\ninappropriate merely because it was more restrictive than Greenacres. This was\n\nerror, for the reasons we discussed above. C.L.'s parents were not precluded\n\nfrom selecting Eagle Hill merely because it was more restrictive than Greenacres.\n\nIn contrast to the SRO, the IHO considered the restrictiveness of Eagle Hill\n\nwithout giving it dispositive weight, concluding that \"C.L.'s need for a small\n\nclass, special education program with specific programs and strategies to address\n\nC.L.'s significant needs far outweighs [the] benefit from interaction with non-\n\ndisabled peers.\"\n\n\n\n\n      4\n              To be sure, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the\nSRO's conclusion that C.L. made progress at Greenacres, including favorable test results\nand report cards. But overall, the results were decidedly mixed, and C.L. continued to\nhave difficulties while at Greenacres. The private evaluations, for example, showed\nsignificant academic and learning deficiencies. Moreover, the progress that C.L. made\nat Greenacres was undoubtedly the result of the \"increasing amounts of special\neducation services, programs, and accommodations\" that he was receiving, including\n\"an aide for most of the day\" and \"substantial 1:1 assistance from the regular education\nteacher.\"\n                                          -29-\n\f             On these bases, the IHO ruled that \"Eagle Hill is an appropriate, if\n\nnot an ideal placement for C.L.\" We are persuaded by the IHO's reasoning, and\n\nwe thus defer to the IHO's conclusion that Eagle Hill was appropriate for C.L.\n\n             b.      The Equities\n\n             We also defer to the IHO's ruling with respect to the weighing of the\n\nequities, an issue that the SRO did not reach after finding the placement at Eagle\n\nHill inappropriate. Important to the equitable consideration is whether the\n\nparents obstructed or were uncooperative in the school district's efforts to meet\n\nits obligations under the IDEA. See Warren G., 190 F.3d at 85-86. As the IHO\n\nnoted, the parents cooperated with the District in its efforts to meet its\n\nobligations under the IDEA. See id. Hence, their pursuit of a private placement\n\nwas not a basis for denying their tuition reimbursement, even assuming, as the\n\nDistrict contended before the IHO, that the parents never intended to keep C.L.\n\nin public school for the 2008-09 school year. The fact is that the parents also\n\nrequested that the District evaluate C.L. under the IDEA and develop an IEP for\n\nhim. When the District determined -- incorrectly -- that C.L. was not entitled to\n\nspecial services under the IDEA, it was appropriate for the parents to turn to a\n\nprivate placement.\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\f             The question remains whether to reverse or remand for further\n\ndevelopment of the record. Here, where the SRO's analysis was not sufficiently\n\nreasoned but the IHO's detailed findings and conclusions were thorough and\n\ncarefully considered, we defer to the IHO and reverse for the reimbursement of\n\ntuition as awarded by the IHO.\n\nB.    The Rehabilitation Act Claim\n\n             We turn to C.L.'s Rehabilitation Act claim. Section 504 provides:\n\n                No otherwise qualified individual with a\n                disability in the United States, . . . shall, solely by\n                reason of her or his disability, be excluded from\n                the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\n                be subjected to discrimination under any\n                program or activity receiving Federal financial\n                assistance.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794 (a). A prima facie violation of Section 504 requires proof from the\n\nplaintiff that \"(1) he is a '[disabled] person' under the Rehabilitation Act; (2) he is\n\n'otherwise qualified' for the program; (3) he is excluded from benefits solely\n\nbecause of his [disability]; and (4) the program or special service receives federal\n\nfunding.\" Mrs. C. v. Wheaton, 916 F.2d 69, 74 (2d Cir. 1990). Courts in this Circuit\n\nhave recognized that a Section 504 claim may be predicated on the claim that a\n\ndisabled student was \"denied access to a free appropriate education, as\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\fcompared to the free appropriate education non-disabled students receive.\" S.W.\n\nby J.W. v. Warren, 528 F. Supp. 2d 282, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2007); see also BD v. DeBuono,\n\n130 F. Supp. 2d 401, 439 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). Such a claim, however, requires proof\n\nof bad faith or gross misjudgment. See Wenger v. Canastota Cent. Sch. Dist., 979 F.\n\nSupp. 147, 152 (N.D.N.Y. 1997) (\"[S]omething more than a mere violation of the\n\nIDEA is necessary in order to show a violation of Section 504 in the context of\n\neducating children with disabilities, i.e., a plaintiff must demonstrate that a\n\nschool district acted with bad faith or gross misjudgment.\"), aff'd mem., 208 F.3d\n\n204 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n             Here, as the district court held, the parents failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence of bad faith or gross misjudgment to raise an issue for trial.\n\nThey claim that the District \"deliberately\" limited the accommodations provided\n\nto C.L. to avoid triggering policies that would have required the development of\n\nan IEP. They fail, however, to point to any concrete evidence to support the\n\nassertion. On this record, no reasonable factfinder could find bad faith or gross\n\nmisjudgment. The fact that the District was wrong in concluding that C.L. was\n\nnot entitled to an IEP does not, without more, mean that it acted in violation of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fthe Rehabilitation Act. See S.W. by J.W., 528 F. Supp. 2d at 289; Wenger v.\n\nCanastota Ctrl. Sch. Dist., 979 F. Supp. at 152.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n             We conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the parents'\n\nIDEA claim for private tuition reimbursement, but that it correctly dismissed\n\ntheir Rehabilitation Act claim. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nREVERSED in part and AFFIRMED in part, and we REMAND the case to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellants\n\non their IDEA claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -33-\n\f",

His parents, plaintiffs-appellants C.L. and G.W., placed\n\nhim in a specialized private school designed to educate children with learning\n\ndisabilities and sued the District for tuition reimbursement under the Individuals\n\nwith Disabilities Education Act (the \"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. An\n\nImpartial Hearing Officer (\"IHO\") awarded tuition reimbursement to C.L.'s\n\nparents, holding that the District denied C.L. a FAPE and that the parents'\n\nprivate placement was appropriate. A State Review Officer (\"SRO\") reversed,\n\nagreeing that C.L. was denied a FAPE but holding that the parents' private\n\nplacement was not appropriate, at least in part because the specialized private\n\nschool was a more restrictive environment than the public school in which C.L.\n\nhad been placed. The district court affirmed.\n\n             We reverse. We hold that the SRO's decision was insufficiently\n\nreasoned to merit deference and we instead defer to the IHO's decision, which\n\nwas more thorough and carefully considered. The IHO detailed the programs\n\nthat the parents' placement provided to C.L. and the progress C.L. made there.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fThe IHO also took into account the school's restrictiveness as one factor in his\n\ndecision. In contrast, the SRO did not examine the kind of education and\n\nservices the parents' placement provided C.L., effectively ruling that the school\n\nwas inappropriate only because it was more restrictive than the public school he\n\npreviously attended. When a public school district, however, denies a child with\n\na disability a FAPE, a private placement is not inappropriate merely because the\n\nenvironment is more restrictive than the public school alternative. When a child\n\nis denied a FAPE, his parents may turn to an appropriate specialized private\n\nschool designed to meet special needs, even if the school is more restrictive.\n\n             The parents also brought a claim under Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act of 1973 (the \"Rehabilitation Act\"), 29 U.S.C. § 794, alleging that\n\nthe District discriminated against C.L. on account of his disability. The district\n\ncourt granted summary judgment dismissing the claim, concluding that the\n\nparents had not presented sufficient evidence of bad faith or gross misjudgment.\n\nWe affirm the dismissal of the Rehabilitation Act claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f                                  BACKGROUND\n\nA.

The Facts\n\n             The relevant facts are largely undisputed. C.L. has been diagnosed\n\nwith attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\"ADHD\"), nonverbal learning\n\ndisability, and executive function weakness. He has exhibited problems with\n\nanxiety, stuttering, fine motor development, and visual motor coordination, all of\n\nwhich inhibit his ability to learn. From the 2004-05 school year to the 2007-08\n\nschool year -- kindergarten to third grade -- C.L. attended Greenacres Elementary\n\n\n                                           -7-\n\fSchool, a public school in Scarsdale, New York, operated by the District. During\n\nthe fourth year, the 2007-08 school year, C.L.'s parents requested that C.L. be\n\nconsidered for an IEP under the IDEA. After the District determined that he was\n\nnot entitled to an IEP, the parents enrolled C.L. at the Eagle Hill School, a\n\nspecialized private school in Greenwich, Connecticut, for the 2008-09 school year.\n\n      1.     The First Three Years at Greenacres\n\n             In October 2004, in kindergarten, C.L. began receiving speech-\n\nlanguage therapy sessions once a week to address his \"episodic dy[sfl]uency.\" In\n\nJanuary 2005, he began receiving pre-reading instruction sessions twice a week\n\nin Greenacres's Learning Resources Center (\"LRC\").1 An occupational therapy\n\nevaluation in March 2005 noted C.L.'s \"delays in fine motor development and\n\nvisual motor coordination, which [were] impacting [ ] his ability to perform\n\nclassroom tasks, such as writing and using scissors.\"\n\n             In March 2005, the District convened a committee pursuant to\n\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (the \"504 Committee\") to consider whether\n\nC.L. was disabled within the meaning of the statute and, if so, to recommend a\n\n\n\n      1\n             The LRC at Greenacres provides small-group academic support services\nto students with significant delays in their academic development.\n\n                                         -8-\n\fcourse of action. The 504 Committee determined that C.L. was eligible for\n\nservices under the Rehabilitation Act and thus prepared a Section 504\n\nAccommodation Plan (the \"504 Plan\"). The 504 Plan recommended that C.L. be\n\nremoved from class for thirty minutes once weekly for occupational therapy\n\nsessions in a 1:1 student-to-teacher ratio setting.\n\n             The 504 Committee reconvened in October 2005 and October 2006 to\n\nplan for the 2005-06 and 2006-07 school years, respectively. Noting C.L.'s\n\ndifficulties with writing, remembering routines, and sustaining attention, the\n\n2005-06 504 Plan recommended: the continuation of the once weekly\n\nspeech-language therapy sessions in a 5:1 setting; an increase of the LRC sessions\n\nto four times a week in a 6:1 setting; and an increase of the occupational therapy\n\nsessions to twice weekly in one 1:1 setting and one 4:1 setting. The 2006-07 504\n\nPlan observed that \"[C.L.'s] reading ha[d] improved,\" but his \"level of disfluency\n\nha[d] increased . . . [to] stuttering\" and he had begun to exhibit anxiety in the\n\nclassroom. The 2006-07 504 Plan called for C.L. to continue largely the same\n\nservices as the previous school year, except that the twice weekly occupational\n\ntherapy sessions were now both in 1:1 settings.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f             In April 2007, a private occupational therapy evaluation arranged by\n\nC.L.'s parents placed C.L. in the twelfth percentile in visual-motor integration,\n\nsecond percentile in visual perception, first percentile in motor coordination, and\n\nsixth percentile in total motor composite. In May 2007, C.L.'s parents arranged\n\nfor private occupational therapy sessions for him and consequently informed the\n\nDistrict that he would no longer be receiving occupational therapy at Greenacres.\n\n             C.L.'s parents also arranged for the Soifer Center to conduct an\n\nindependent psychoeducational evaluation of C.L., which took place over the\n\ncourse of six days in April and May 2007. The Soifer Center's evaluation placed\n\nC.L.'s \"intellectual functioning within the upper end of the Low Average range.\"\n\nThe evaluation found, however, that C.L.'s language and executive functioning\n\nabilities were weak, and that his reading and mathematical skills were also\n\nlimited. Alarmed by this evaluation, C.L.'s parents requested that the 504\n\nCommittee reconvene.\n\n             On June 6, 2007, two days after the parents' conference with the\n\nSoifer Center about their child, the 504 Committee amended C.L.'s 504 Plan. The\n\namended 504 Plan noted that \"[a]lthough [C.L.] has made overall progress this\n\nyear both in class and in the LRC, his teacher corroborates the findings of the\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\f[Soifer Center] evaluation.\" The 504 Plan acknowledged that C.L. fidgeted and\n\noften required refocusing and reteaching of new concepts when he was in a large\n\nclassroom setting, but noted that he had less trouble remaining on task in the\n\nsmaller learning environment of the LRC. The 504 Plan was amended to add \"15\n\nhours of classroom aide time [per week] . . . to assist [C.L.] with his organization\n\nand execution of writing tasks,\" as well as various program and testing\n\nmodifications.\n\n             After the end of the 2006-07 school year, C.L.'s parents sought a\n\n\"second opinion\" on the results of the Soifer Center evaluation and arranged for a\n\nneurodevelopmental evaluation of C.L. by Dr. Marilyn C. Agin. After examining\n\nC.L. in June 2007, Dr. Agin found that he had an early history of dyspraxia,\n\nwhich caused him to suffer from \"weaknesses in attention, organization and\n\nsequencing; handwriting difficulties; and language processing difficulties.\" She\n\nalso expressed concern about C.L.'s emotional well-being and self-esteem.\n\nAlthough Dr. Agin largely concurred with the recommendations of the 504 Plan\n\ncreated at Greenacres, she nonetheless \"strongly urged that [C.L.'s] parents\n\ninvestigate a private educational setting with an expertise in teaching children\n\nwith attentional and learning issues.\"\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f      2.     The Fourth Year at Greenacres\n\n             In October 2007, at the beginning of C.L.'s fourth year at Greenacres,\n\nthe 504 Committee met and made no changes to the amended 504 Plan for\n\n2007-08. In November 2007, a month after the 504 Committee created the 2007-08\n\n504 Plan, C.L.'s parents requested a review by the District's Committee on Special\n\nEducation (\"CSE\") to determine whether C.L. was entitled under the IDEA to\n\nspecial education services, including the development of an IEP.2 The parents\n\nprovided the CSE with the private evaluations of C.L., and the CSE conducted its\n\nown classroom observation, speech-language evaluation, and standardized\n\ntesting of C.L., along with a developmental history interview of the parents.\n\n             The speech-language evaluation indicated that C.L. was consistently\n\nperforming \"in the average to significantly above average range.\" On the\n\nStanford Diagnostic Reading Test, C.L. scored in the 82nd, 92nd, and 43rd\n\npercentiles in phonetic analysis, vocabulary, and comprehension respectively.\n\nOn the first administration of the Stanford Diagnostic Mathematics Test, C.L.\n\nscored in the 9th and 3rd percentiles in concepts and applications and in\n\n\n\n      2\n             New York assigns responsibility for fulfilling the state's obligations under\nthe IDEA to local Committees on Special Education. N.Y. Educ. Law § 4402(1)(b)(1)(a)\n(McKinney 1999); see also Walczak, 142 F.3d at 123.\n                                          -12-\n\fcomputations respectively, but the test administrator believed those scores did\n\nnot reflect C.L.'s abilities because he was not concentrating. The second\n\nadministration a few days later placed C.L. in the 38th and 84th percentiles in\n\nconcepts and applications and in computations respectively.\n\n            After reviewing the private and District evaluations of C.L., the CSE\n\nconcluded on January 8, 2008, that C.L. was not disabled under the IDEA and\n\nthat he therefore was not eligible for special education services or an IEP. The\n\nCSE determined, however, that C.L. remained eligible for services and\n\naccommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The CSE added\n\nthat, \"[s]ince [C.L.'s] reading skills have improved, committee members would\n\nlike to reduce his time in the LRC to two periods per week, to address his writing\n\nskills.\" In reaching these conclusions, the CSE acknowledged, as the parents\n\ncontended, that C.L. had \"become increasingly resistant to attending the LRC . . .\n\n[and] fe[lt] stigmatized by having to leave the classroom to attend the LRC for\n\nfour periods per week.\"\n\n             In May 2008, the 504 Committee convened to begin planning for\n\nC.L.'s fourth grade year. The 2008-09 504 Plan continued the services C.L. was\n\nalready receiving. As suggested by the CSE, however, C.L.'s LRC sessions were\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\freduced from four to two times a week. Dissatisfied with the progress he was\n\nmaking, C.L.'s parents informed the District on June 19, 2008, that they were\n\nwithdrawing C.L. from Greenacres and enrolling him at the Eagle Hill School.\n\n      3.    The 2008-09 School Year at Eagle Hill\n\n            The Eagle Hill School is a private school for children with\n\ndisabilities. The school educates children with language-based learning\n\ndisabilities, approximately half of whom also have attention disorders. In\n\ndetermining whether to admit C.L., Eagle Hill reviewed his educational records,\n\ninterviewed his parents, and observed him in a two-day visit during which he\n\nwas paired with a current student. Eagle Hill teachers evaluated C.L. to\n\ndetermine his cognitive potential, learning style, and academic strengths and\n\nneeds, and considered whether he would benefit from the Eagle Hill program.\n\n            C.L. was admitted and assigned an advisor who met with him daily\n\nto \"coordinate[] and oversee[] [his] academic program,\" and to help him with\n\n\"goal setting, communication among the staff, communication between teaching\n\nstaff and specialists, [and] communication between school and home.\"\n\n            Eagle Hill employs a \"diagnostic teaching model where teachers are\n\nconstantly, on a daily basis, assessing a child's progressed goal and making\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fadjustments based on that assessment, tailoring accommodations to the child's\n\nlearning style.\" Class sizes at Eagle Hill are tailored to the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the individual students, and children with similar learning styles\n\nare assigned to the same classes. C.L. was placed in a 3:1 ratio language arts\n\ntutorial class for two periods daily to assist with his reading, comprehension,\n\nwriting, and study skills. For math, history, writing, literature, and modeling,\n\nC.L. was placed in classes ranging from five to nine students in each class.\n\n             C.L.'s progress reports at Eagle Hill, issued in December 2008 and\n\nJune 2009, show that he made progress in all subject areas. C.L. also became\n\nmore active and enthusiastic over the school year, and was better able to express\n\nhis ideas and work independently.\n\nC.    Proceedings Below\n\n      1.     Administrative Proceedings\n\n             On June 5, 2009, C.L.'s parents requested a due process hearing\n\nbefore an IHO to seek reimbursement of the tuition that they paid to Eagle Hill.\n\nThe IHO concluded that at least by the third grade, if not before, C.L. was\n\nreceiving such \"a substantial array of test modifications, classroom\n\naccommodations, special education services and related services\" that the District\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fwas obligated to evaluate him under the IDEA. The IHO further determined that\n\nthe District should have classified C.L. as disabled under the IDEA, which would\n\nhave entitled him to special education services and the creation of an IEP. The\n\nIHO ruled that, by failing to provide an IEP for C.L., the District denied him a\n\nFAPE. The IHO also concluded that the 504 Plan proposed by the District for the\n\n2008-09 school year was not an appropriate substitute for an IEP because, among\n\nother things, the 504 Plan recommended a general education class that was too\n\nlarge. The IHO also held that the parents' private placement was appropriate\n\nunder the IDEA, highlighting the various services Eagle Hill offered C.L. and\n\nnoting the \"significant progress\" C.L. made during the 2008-09 school year. The\n\nIHO then weighed the equities and found no reason to deny tuition\n\nreimbursement.\n\n            On appeal, the SRO found error in the IHO's decision. Although the\n\nSRO agreed that C.L. was indeed denied a FAPE, he concluded that the parents\n\nfailed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the private placement they\n\nchose for C.L. was appropriate under the IDEA. In the SRO's view, there was\n\nevidence in the record that C.L. \"made progress\" at Greenacres, and consequently\n\n\"[C.L.] did not require a special education environment such as Eagle Hill, which\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fprovided no opportunity for the student to interact with nondisabled peers.\"\n\nThe SRO then concluded: \"When considering the restrictiveness of the parental\n\nplacement, under the facts of the instant case, I conclude that the parents are not\n\nentitled to an award of tuition reimbursement based on the restrictiveness of\n\nEagle Hill.\" The SRO did not discuss any of the specific services provided at\n\nEagle Hill other than to observe that C.L. was not receiving occupational therapy\n\nat Eagle Hill.\n\n      2.     The District Court\n\n             C.L.'s parents filed suit in the district court seeking to have the SRO's\n\ndecision reversed. They also added a claim under Section 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act, arguing that the District had discriminated against C.L. on\n\naccount of his disabilities. The district court determined that the SRO's decision\n\nwas entitled to deference because there was evidence supporting the SRO's\n\nconclusions that C.L. made progress at Greenacres and that he benefited from\n\ninteractions with his peers.

Mar. 4, 2014).\n\n      2.     Application\n\n             Both the IHO and SRO found that C.L. was denied a FAPE because\n\nhe should have been classified as a student with a disability who was eligible for\n\nspecial education services under the IDEA. The District does not challenge these\n\nfindings. Hence, the questions presented are (a) whether C.L.'s placement at\n\nEagle Hill was appropriate, and, if so, (b) whether the equities weigh in favor of\n\nC.L. and his parents. We address both questions in turn.\n\n             a.       The Appropriateness of the Placement at Eagle Hill\n\n             We conclude that the SRO's decision that the placement at Eagle Hill\n\nwas not appropriate is not entitled to the deference ordinarily accorded to state\n\nadministrative IDEA decisions. The SRO's decision was not sufficiently reasoned\n\nor carefully considered because the SRO did not consider or comment on any of\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fthe specific services provided to C.L. at Eagle Hill or the progress that the record\n\nshows he made at the school. Instead, we defer to the IHO's decision, which was\n\nmore thorough and carefully considered. The IHO discussed in detail Eagle\n\nHill's services and C.L.'s progress there.\n\n             The SRO did not discuss the particulars of the Eagle Hill program or\n\nwhether its services were appropriate for C.L.'s needs, other than to note that\n\nEagle Hill did not provide occupational therapy services. C.L. was receiving\n\nthose services privately anyway, and his parents were not required in any event\n\nto prove that the \"private placement furnishes every special service necessary.\"\n\nFrank G., 459 F.3d at 365.\n\n             In contrast, the IHO examined the specifics of the education C.L.\n\nreceived at Eagle Hill. The IHO initially noted Dr. Agin's private\n\nneurodevelopmental evaluation of C.L., which recommended that he be placed\n\nin a private school that specializes in educating learning-disabled children. The\n\nIHO then considered Eagle Hill's curriculum, describing it as \"researched based\n\nand individualized for each student,\" explaining that \"[a] diagnostic model is\n\nused in which a student's progress is assessed on a daily basis and adjustments\n\nmade as needed.\" The IHO also discussed how, before Eagle Hill admitted C.L.,\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\f\"his educational records were reviewed, parents were interviewed and a two day\n\nvisit to the school by the student took place,\" after which the teachers who\n\ninstructed C.L. participated with an admissions team in determining C.L.'s\n\nappropriateness for Eagle Hill. The IHO found \"that such a process is likely to\n\nresult in an appropriate placement.\"\n\n             The IHO also delved into the specifics of C.L.'s classes, recounting\n\nhow \"C.L. received a tutorial class two periods per day with three students\n\ninstructed by a special education teacher specifically aimed at remediating the\n\nstudent's weaknesses in written expression and study skills, areas of significant\n\nneed for C.L.\" That tutorial class, the IHO found \"was a particularly appropriate\n\nprogram for C.L.\" The IHO also discussed C.L.'s small class sizes at Eagle Hill:\n\nfive to eight students for math and history, nine for literature, and seven for\n\nwriting. For that writing class, the IHO explained that \"modeling and other\n\nspecial strategies were used for instruction\" because it was an \"area of substantial\n\ndeficit for C.L.\"\n\n             Moreover, the IHO related how \"[i]n addition to small class\n\ninstruction using individualized teaching strategies and a daily tutorial period in\n\nareas of significant difficulty, Eagle Hill provided C.L. with an advisor who met\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fwith the student daily, observed him in class, and participated in weekly staff\n\nmeetings regarding the student.\" None of this was so much as mentioned by the\n\nSRO. The SRO could not diligently consider whether Eagle Hill was appropriate\n\nwithout assessing what the school had to offer.\n\n             The SRO likewise did not examine C.L.'s progress at Eagle Hill, as\n\nreflected in progress reports, standardized test results, and year-end letters to his\n\nparents. The IHO, by comparison, found that \"C.L. plainly made significant\n\nprogress at Eagle Hill during the 2008/09 school year.\" Citing C.L.'s progress\n\nreports and the testimony of Eagle Hill's Director of Admissions, the IHO\n\nexplained: \"He became enthusiastic about attending school, more confident as a\n\nlearner, [and] better able to express himself and work independently.\" The IHO\n\nalso noted that C.L.'s parent believed Eagle Hill had made C.L. \"more\n\nindependent and confident with less anxiety and better able to make friends.\"\n\nAgain, none of this was mentioned by the SRO.\n\n             By not taking into consideration Eagle Hill's services or C.L.'s\n\nprogress, the SRO improperly gave dispositive weight to the restrictiveness of\n\nEagle Hill in reaching the conclusion that it was inappropriate for C.L. The SRO\n\ndetermined that, because C.L. was making progress in Greenacres's\n\n\n                                        -28-\n\fnonrestrictive general education classrooms with supports and services, Eagle\n\nHill's restrictive program was not the least restrictive environment in which C.L.\n\ncould obtain an appropriate education.4 In effect, the SRO ruled Eagle Hill\n\ninappropriate merely because it was more restrictive than Greenacres. This was\n\nerror, for the reasons we discussed above. C.L.'s parents were not precluded\n\nfrom selecting Eagle Hill merely because it was more restrictive than Greenacres.\n\nIn contrast to the SRO, the IHO considered the restrictiveness of Eagle Hill\n\nwithout giving it dispositive weight, concluding that \"C.L.'s need for a small\n\nclass, special education program with specific programs and strategies to address\n\nC.L.'s significant needs far outweighs [the] benefit from interaction with non-\n\ndisabled peers.\"\n\n\n\n\n      4\n              To be sure, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the\nSRO's conclusion that C.L. made progress at Greenacres, including favorable test results\nand report cards. But overall, the results were decidedly mixed, and C.L. continued to\nhave difficulties while at Greenacres. The private evaluations, for example, showed\nsignificant academic and learning deficiencies. Moreover, the progress that C.L. made\nat Greenacres was undoubtedly the result of the \"increasing amounts of special\neducation services, programs, and accommodations\" that he was receiving, including\n\"an aide for most of the day\" and \"substantial 1:1 assistance from the regular education\nteacher.\"\n                                          -29-\n\f             On these bases, the IHO ruled that \"Eagle Hill is an appropriate, if\n\nnot an ideal placement for C.L.\" We are persuaded by the IHO's reasoning, and\n\nwe thus defer to the IHO's conclusion that Eagle Hill was appropriate for C.L.\n\n             b.      The Equities\n\n             We also defer to the IHO's ruling with respect to the weighing of the\n\nequities, an issue that the SRO did not reach after finding the placement at Eagle\n\nHill inappropriate. Important to the equitable consideration is whether the\n\nparents obstructed or were uncooperative in the school district's efforts to meet\n\nits obligations under the IDEA. See Warren G., 190 F.3d at 85-86. As the IHO\n\nnoted, the parents cooperated with the District in its efforts to meet its\n\nobligations under the IDEA. See id. Hence, their pursuit of a private placement\n\nwas not a basis for denying their tuition reimbursement, even assuming, as the\n\nDistrict contended before the IHO, that the parents never intended to keep C.L.\n\nin public school for the 2008-09 school year. The fact is that the parents also\n\nrequested that the District evaluate C.L. under the IDEA and develop an IEP for\n\nhim. When the District determined -- incorrectly -- that C.L. was not entitled to\n\nspecial services under the IDEA, it was appropriate for the parents to turn to a\n\nprivate placement.\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\f             The question remains whether to reverse or remand for further\n\ndevelopment of the record. Here, where the SRO's analysis was not sufficiently\n\nreasoned but the IHO's detailed findings and conclusions were thorough and\n\ncarefully considered, we defer to the IHO and reverse for the reimbursement of\n\ntuition as awarded by the IHO.\n\nB.    The Rehabilitation Act Claim\n\n             We turn to C.L.'s Rehabilitation Act claim. Section 504 provides:\n\n                No otherwise qualified individual with a\n                disability in the United States, . . . shall, solely by\n                reason of her or his disability, be excluded from\n                the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or\n                be subjected to discrimination under any\n                program or activity receiving Federal financial\n                assistance.\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794 (a). A prima facie violation of Section 504 requires proof from the\n\nplaintiff that \"(1) he is a '[disabled] person' under the Rehabilitation Act; (2) he is\n\n'otherwise qualified' for the program; (3) he is excluded from benefits solely\n\nbecause of his [disability]; and (4) the program or special service receives federal\n\nfunding.\" Mrs. C. v.

They fail, however, to point to any concrete evidence to support the\n\nassertion. On this record, no reasonable factfinder could find bad faith or gross\n\nmisjudgment. The fact that the District was wrong in concluding that C.L. was\n\nnot entitled to an IEP does not, without more, mean that it acted in violation of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -32-\n\fthe Rehabilitation Act.

Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\n\nREVERSED in part and AFFIRMED in part, and we REMAND the case to the\n\ndistrict court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellants\n\non their IDEA claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -33-\n\f</pre>",
