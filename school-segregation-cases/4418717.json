Arthur, J., did not participate in the\nCourt’s decision to report this opinion pursuant\nto Md. Rule 8-605.1.\n\f       In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Starlena Stevenson sued S&S Partnership\n\n(“S&S”), Stanley Rochkind, and Dear Management & Construction Company (“Dear”)\n\nfor negligence and violations of the Consumer Protection Act (“CPA”), Md. Code (1975,\n\n2013 Repl. Vol.), section 13-301 et seq. of the Commercial Law Article (“CL”).1 As\n\nrelevant here, she alleged that she suffered injuries as a result of ingesting lead-based\n\npaint inside 3823 Fairview Avenue (“the Fairview Property”), which was owned by Mr.\n\nRochkind and S&S and was managed by Dear.\n\n       In March of 2014, the case was tried to a jury with Judge Steven Sfekas presiding\n\n(“the First Trial”). The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Stevenson, awarding her\n\n$829,000 in economic damages and $534,000 in non-economic damages. Mr. Rochkind\n\nmoved for a new trial or, in the alternative, a remittitur. Judge Sfekas granted the motion\n\nin part, ordering a partial new trial on damages.\n\n       The partial new trial was held before a jury in October and November of 2014,\n\nwith Judge Pamela White presiding (“the Second Trial”). The jury returned a verdict\n\nawarding Ms. Stevenson $753,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in non-economic\n\ndamages.    Mr. Rochkind filed a motion for new trial, which was denied, and Ms.\n\nStevenson filed a motion for attorneys’ fees, which also was denied. Applying the cap on\n\nnon-economic damages, see Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), section 11-108 of the\n\n\n\n       1\n         As we shall discuss, Ms. Stevenson also named four other defendants in her\ncomplaint. By the time of the trials in this matter, the only remaining active claims were\nagainst Mr. Rochkind, Dear, and S&S.\n\fCourts and Judicial Proceedings Article (“CJP”), Judge White reduced the judgment to\n\n$1,103,000.\n\n      Mr. Rochkind noted this appeal, presenting eleven questions for review, which we\n\nhave combined and rephrased as follows:\n\n      I. Did Judge Sfekas err by ordering a partial new trial, instead of a full new\n      trial, and did Judge White improperly narrow the issues to be re-tried?\n\n      II. In the First and the Second Trials, did the court err by declining to hold a\n      Frye-Reed hearing and by ruling that Cynthia Hall-Carrington, M.D., could\n      testify that the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing cause of\n      Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels, that Ms. Stevenson’s ADHD was\n      caused by that lead exposure, and that Ms. Stevenson lost a specific number\n      of IQ points as a result of that lead exposure?\n\n      III. In the Second Trial, did the circuit court err by not holding a Frye-Reed\n      hearing to assess the methodologies employed by Mark Lieberman, a\n      vocational counselor, and by permitting him to opine that, but for Ms.\n      Stevenson’s “cognitive defects,” she would have functioned as an “average\n      high school graduate”?\n\n      IV. In the Second Trial, did the court err by permitting Michael Conte,\n      Ph.D to offer economic loss opinions premised solely on Mr. Lieberman’s\n      testimony, which should have been excluded?\n\n      V. In the Second Trial, did the court err by precluding Mr. Rochkind’s\n      economics expert from testifying about research that quantifies the loss of\n      lifetime earnings caused by incremental increases in blood lead levels?\n\n      VI. In the Second Trial, did the court err by precluding defense counsel\n      from cross-examining Dr. Conte about two exhibits introduced into\n      evidence by Ms. Stevenson that showed that she may have been eligible for\n      free job coaching?[2]\n\n      2\n       Mr. Rochkind phrased his questions presented as follows:\n      A. The lower court erred in the first trial (“Stevenson 1”) when, after\n         determining post-trial that allowing Dr. Conte to testify was error, it\n         ordered only a partial new trial.\n\n                                                                             (Continued…)\n                                             2\n\f(…continued)\n     B. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Cynthia Hall-Carrington, to\n         opine that lead paint from 3823 Fairview Avenue was a substantial\n         contributing cause of Appellee’s elevated blood lead levels despite the\n         fact that Dr. Hall-Carrington (1) is a pediatrician with no experience in\n         lead risk assessment, (2) performed no investigation into other known\n         lead sources, (3) did not consider or rule out other potential lead\n         sources, including prior residences, concurrent visitation properties or\n         ambien[t ]sources, and (4) relied exclusively on records selectively\n         provided to her by Appellee’s counsel.\n     C. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that (i)\n         lead exposure can cause ADHD and (ii) lead paint from Appellant’s\n         property caused Appellee’s ADHD, despite the fact that the\n         overwhelming opinion of the relevant medical community is that\n         heredity is the primary cause of ADHD; that the medical community\n         does not know whether lead exposure caused or is even associated with\n         ADHD; that Appellee’s mother, brother and possibly father have all\n         been diagnosed with ADHD; and that Dr. Hall-Carrington never\n         examined Appellee or performed a differential diagnosis.\n     D. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that\n         Appellee’s alleged injuries were caused by lead exposure at Appellant’s\n         property, despite the fact that she based her opinion/diagnosis\n         exclusively on epidemiological studies of the general population (which\n         she admitted cannot be used to diagnose individuals); never examined\n         Appellee; never performed a differential diagnosis and failed to consider\n         or account for Appellee’s non-lead related problems.\n     E. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that\n         Appellee lost a specific number of IQ points as the result of alleged lead\n         exposure (from any and all sources) based on studies involving the\n         effect of lead exposure (from any and all sources) based on studies\n         involving the effect [o]f lead exposure on the general population despite\n         the fact that she has no experience in IQ testing, had no foundation for\n         rendering such an opinion, and two Maryland appellate courts have held\n         that rendering such an opinion is error.\n     F. The lower courts erred by rejecting Appellants’ request to hold an\n         evidentiary pretrial hearing on Appellee’s experts (Dr. Hall-Carrington\n         and Mark Lieberman) under Frye-Reed and/or Rule 5-702 to present\n         expert testimony concerning the foundation, reliability and methodology\n         employed by Appellee’s experts.\n\n                                                                           (Continued…)\n                                            3\n\f       Ms. Stevenson noted a cross-appeal, presenting one question: Did the circuit court\n\nerr by denying her request for attorneys’ fees?\n\n       For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.\n\n                             FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n     G. The first trial court erred when it granted a partial new trial on damages\n         only (rather than a complete new trial), despite the fact that the issues of\n         liability and damages were inextricably intertwined[.]\n     H. The trial court committed error when it allowed Appellee’s vocational\n         expert to opine that Appellee would have functioned as an “average\n         high school graduate” but for her “cognitive deficits,” despite the fact\n         that the expert had no qualifications or foundation for rendering such an\n         opinion and purported to arrive at his opinion based on a methodology\n         (the PEEDS-RAPEL Method) that does not purport to, and cannot be\n         used to, predict educational attainment.\n     I. The trial court committed error in excluding Appellant’s expert\n         economist from testifying about the generally accepted scientific\n         research (including the numbers used by the Centers for Disease\n         Control) that quantifies the loss of lifetime earnings caused by\n         incremental increases in blood lead levels to rebut the testimony of\n         Appellee’s expert economist and as support for his own opinions[.]\n     J. The trial court committed error when it allowed Appellee to introduce\n         into eviden[c]e two exhibits “for all purposes” which showed that the\n         Appellee was eligible for free job coaching, and then precluded\n         Appellant from using this same evidence to cross-examine Appellee’s\n         expert economist who based his loss of income calculations on the\n         assumption that the Appellee would never earn any future income\n         because she could not afford job coaching.\n     K. The trial court committed error when it allowed Appellee’s expert\n         economist to render economic loss opinions based solely on the\n         opinions of Appellee’s vocational expert, which themselves should have\n         been excluded.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       Ms. Stevenson was born on December 22, 1990.               Her mother, Charlena\n\nMontgomery, was 17 years old at the time. Ms. Stevenson was raised by her mother and\n\nher maternal grandmother, Lorena Cooks. Her father, Vernon Stevenson, was largely\n\nabsent from her life. She has a maternal half-brother, who is 22, and a maternal half-\n\nsister, who is 16.\n\n       From birth until age nine months, Ms. Stevenson lived with Ms. Montgomery and\n\nMs. Cooks at 2110 Clifton Avenue, in Baltimore City (“2110 Clifton Property”).\n\nAccording to Ms. Montgomery, the interior walls of that property were covered with\n\nwood paneling, the windows were vinyl, and there was no chipping, peeling, or flaking\n\n(“deteriorated”) paint.\n\n       In October of 1991, Ms. Stevenson and Ms. Montgomery moved to the Fairview\n\nProperty, a West Baltimore rowhouse that was built in 1930. Ms. Montgomery recalled\n\nthat the interior of the property was repainted before they moved in. The painters simply\n\ncovered over the existing flaking and chipping paint, however, and the paint soon\n\ndeteriorated on the interior walls.     There also was deteriorated paint on the wood\n\nwindowsills, the ceilings, the heaters, and the front porch.\n\n       Ms. Stevenson lived at the Fairview Property for fifteen months. During that time,\n\nshe started walking. She liked to look out the window. Ms. Montgomery saw her\n\ntouching the windowsills and then her mouth, and licking the windows. Ms. Stevenson\n\nsometimes rested her food on the windowsill and ate while standing there.\n\n       For the first 13 months that she lived at the Fairview Property, Ms. Stevenson\n\nspent from 7 a.m. to 3 or 4 p.m., five days a week, at the house of a babysitter, while her\n\n                                              5\n\fmother attended high school. The babysitter’s house was located at 2114 Clifton Avenue\n\n(“2114 Clifton Property”), two doors down from the 2110 Clifton Property. The 2114\n\nClifton Property had been “gut rehabilitated” in 1985 and had new windows. There was\n\nno deteriorated paint at that property.\n\n       In January of 1993, soon after Ms. Stevenson turned two, she and Ms.\n\nMontgomery moved to what Ms. Montgomery called a “newer apartment,” on\n\nPennsylvania Avenue (“the Pennsylvania Avenue Property”).            According to Ms.\n\nMontgomery, there was no deteriorated paint at that property.\n\n       Ms. Stevenson’s blood was tested for lead four times, beginning when she was\n\nalmost two years old and was living at the Fairview Property, and ending when she was\n\nseven years old. The results were as follows:\n\n    Date                           Blood Lead Level         Ms. Stevenson’s\n                                                            Address\n    October 29, 1992               14 µg/dL                 Fairview Property\n\n    January 8, 1993                13 µg/dL                 Fairview Property\n\n    March 17, 1993                 11 µg/dL                 Pennsylvania    Avenue\n                                                            Property\n    September 3, 1998              8 µg/dL                  424    Oxford     Court,\n                                                            Baltimore City or\n                                                            1809 Raynor Avenue,\n                                                            Baltimore City3\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        In her first amended complaint, Ms. Stevenson alleged that she lived at the\nOxford Court address from 1996 to 1998 and at the Raynor Avenue address from 1998 to\n1999.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      When Ms. Stevenson was five years old, Ms. Montgomery took her to the\n\nKennedy Krieger Institute (“KKI”) for an evaluation because she was struggling to pay\n\nattention in school and was “hyper.” Thomas Ley, Ph.D, a KKI psychologist, determined\n\nthat Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive functioning was within the “low average to borderline\n\nrange,” with a full scale IQ of 76 (+/- 5). He diagnosed her with Attention Deficit\n\nHyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”), for which he prescribed Adderal, and recommended\n\nfurther testing to rule out a developmental language disorder. Ms. Stevenson remained\n\non Adderal until she was 14.\n\n      Beginning in the third grade, Ms. Stevenson was placed in special education\n\nclasses. She was assigned a one-on-one aide who assisted her in school.\n\n      At age 13, Ms. Stevenson attempted suicide by cutting herself and overdosing on\n\nprescribed medication. The following year, in April of 2005, Ms. Montgomery took Ms.\n\nStevenson to the Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital (“MWPH”) for an evaluation.\n\nMs. Stevenson was complaining of auditory hallucinations and depression. In May of\n\n2005, a psychologist at MWPH tested Ms. Stevenson and determined that she had a full\n\nscale IQ of 65, which is in the “Extremely Low range of ability.” She was diagnosed\n\nwith major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n      Ms. Stevenson never was held back in school or suspended.           In 2008, she\n\ngraduated from high school.       She then enrolled in a Division of Occupational\n\nRehabilitation (“DORS”) program for job training and coaching. Through the DORS\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fprogram, she found a job as a “transporter” for the University of Maryland Medical\n\nSystems. She was fired from that position, however.4\n\n       For about 10 months in 2012 and 2013, Ms. Stevenson was employed part-time at\n\na Royal Farms store, in the kitchen and at the cash register. She quit because she was\n\nbored. In 2014, she worked as a babysitter for her cousin’s children between the hours of\n\n7 p.m. and 7 a.m., earning approximately $200 every other week. At the times of the\n\ntrials in this matter, Ms. Stevenson was unemployed.\n\n       On December 19, 2011, Ms. Stevenson filed suit against Mr. Rochkind and the\n\nother defendants for negligence and unfair trade practices. The First Trial began on\n\nMarch 6, 2014. Ms. Stevenson testified and called three fact witnesses and nine expert\n\nwitnesses in her case. Ms. Stevenson’s and Ms. Montgomery’s testimony was as we\n\nhave recited the facts.\n\n       Christopher White, a certified lead risk assessor for Arc Environmental, Inc.\n\n(“Arc”), testified that, on July 13, 2012, Arc performed x-ray fluorescence (“XRF”)\n\ntesting on the interior and exterior surfaces of the Fairview Property. The XRF testing\n\nrevealed 22 interior painted surfaces and nine exterior painted surfaces that were positive\n\nfor the presence of lead-based paint. Inside the property, door jambs, window casings,\n\nbaseboards, and door casings all tested positive. Mr. White opined that, based upon the\n\nage of the house, and the fact that lead-based paint has been prohibited for use in\n\n       4\n        According to Ms. Stevenson, Ms. Montgomery “got [her] fired” after she showed\nup at work to check on her.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fresidential properties in Baltimore City since 1978, it was more likely than not that the\n\nlead-based paint had been present at the Fairview Property in 1991, when Ms. Stevenson\n\nand Ms. Montgomery moved in.\n\n      Robert Simon, Ph.D, an industrial hygienist, toxicologist, and lead risk assessor,\n\ntestified, based on his review of the records in this case, that neither the 2110 Clifton\n\nProperty, the 2114 Clifton Property, the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, nor other\n\nenvironmental lead were the source of Ms. Stevenson’s lead exposure. He explained that\n\nbecause the 2110 Clifton Property had wood paneling throughout the interior, with the\n\nexception of a bathroom, and had vinyl windows, any lead-based paint was “encased”\n\nand was not a source of lead exposure. Similarly, because the 2114 Clifton Property had\n\nbeen gut-rehabilitated in 1985, had cement steps, new carpet, and no deteriorated paint, it\n\nwas not a source of lead exposure. He had reviewed a 2010 Arc report that showed that\n\nXRF testing inside the vestibule area of the Pennsylvania Avenue Property was negative\n\nfor lead-based paint; and he knew that Ms. Montgomery had testified that the paint at the\n\nPennsylvania Avenue Property was not deteriorated.5 According to Dr. Simon, this\n\nevidence ruled out the Pennsylvania Avenue Property as a source of Ms. Stevenson’s lead\n\nexposure. In light of the age of the Fairview Property, the Arc testing of that property,\n\nand the observed presence of deteriorating paint at that property in the 1991-1993\n\n\n\n      5\n        Because Arc was not able to enter the apartments inside the Pennsylvania\nAvenue Property, no XRF testing was performed inside the apartment where Ms.\nStevenson had lived.\n\n\n                                            9\n\ftimeframe, Dr. Simon opined that there were lead-based paint hazards present at the\n\nFairview Property when Ms. Stevenson lived there.\n\n       Robert Kraft, Psy.D, a psychologist, performed a neuropsychological evaluation of\n\nMs. Stevenson on August 4, 2012. Her full scale IQ was 72, which is in the “borderline\n\nrange of general intelligence,” and her verbal IQ was 66, which is in the “extremely low\n\nrange.” Her verbal comprehension lagged far behind her perceptual reasoning skills, an\n\nindication of a language-based learning disability.        Her memory and executive\n\nfunctioning skills were normal, however, and her motor functioning was above average.\n\nDr. Kraft opined that Ms. Stevenson suffered from numerous cognitive deficits, including\n\nin general intelligence, attention, language function, visual motor functioning, and\n\nacademic achievement. He further opined that these deficits are permanent and are likely\n\nto negatively affect her ability to find employment, manage her personal finances, and\n\nmaintain social connections. (He offered no opinion about the cause of any of Ms.\n\nStevenson’s cognitive deficits.)\n\n       Cynthia Hall-Carrington, M.D., whose testimony we shall discuss in greater detail\n\nbelow, opined that the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing cause of Ms.\n\nStevenson’s elevated blood lead levels. Based upon Ms. Montgomery’s answers to\n\ninterrogatories and the Arc testing at the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, she ruled out the\n\n2114 Clifton Property, the 2110 Clifton Property, and the Pennsylvania Avenue Property\n\nas sources of Ms. Stevenson’s lead exposure. She testified that Ms. Stevenson was\n\ninjured as a result of her elevated blood lead levels, opining that she suffered “deficits\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fand loss of IQ, as well as ADHD and academic decrements also.” She estimated that Ms.\n\nStevenson had lost between 5 and 6 IQ points as a result of lead exposure.\n\n       Mark Lieberman, a certified rehabilitation counselor, testified about Ms.\n\nStevenson’s vocational marketability.       His ultimate opinion was that, although Ms.\n\nStevenson graduated from high school, she will not function in the job market as an\n\n“average high school graduate.” Rather, she only will be able to obtain “basic jobs,” for\n\nexample as a cashier or a lobby attendant, earning the minimum wage (then $7.25/hour),\n\nfor an annual salary of around $15,000.6 Jobs of this sort are likely to be part-time, 20-30\n\nhours per week. In Mr. Lieberman’s view, Ms. Stevenson will require job coaching on a\n\nweekly basis in order to maintain employment.\n\n       Dr. Conte, an economist, relied upon Mr. Lieberman’s expert vocational opinion\n\nto render an opinion about Ms. Stevenson’s potential future earnings and her loss of those\n\nearnings as a result of her cognitive impairments. He opined that, as an average high\n\nschool graduate, Ms. Stevenson could have earned $1,636,458 in wages and fringe\n\nbenefits over her lifetime. Her lifetime wages and fringe benefits as a minimum wage\n\nemployee would be $806,753. The difference between those two figures—$829,705—\n\nwas Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind testified that in 1984 he incorporated Dear and was its sole director.\n\nThe following year, he purchased S&S and became its general partner. At that time, the\n\n       6\n         In 2014, the General Assembly enacted legislation raising the minimum wage\nover a four year period. The minimum wage went up to $8.25 per hour in July 2015, and\nwill go up to $8.75 in July 2016, $9.25 in July 2017, and $10.10 in July 2018.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fFairview Property was an asset of the partnership. In 1991, Charles Runkles was hired as\n\nthe property manager for Dear. Dear was responsible for keeping the rental properties\n\nowned by S&S in compliance with the Baltimore City Housing Code lead-based paint\n\nprohibitions.\n\n       Mr. Runkles testified that Dear has no records about the Fairview Property from\n\nwhen Ms. Stevenson lived there. He was unable to recall whether Dear painted the\n\nproperty before Ms. Montgomery and Ms. Stevenson moved in and whether Dear\n\nreceived any complaints about the condition of the property while they lived there.\n\n       In his case, Mr. Rochkind called three expert witnesses: Neil Blumberg, M.D., a\n\nforensic psychiatrist; Cynthia Munro, Ph.D, a neuro-psychologist; and Joseph Sheller,\n\nM.D., a pediatric neurologist.\n\n       Dr. Blumberg reviewed Ms. Stevenson’s medical records, her deposition, and Ms.\n\nCooks’s deposition. He met with Ms. Stevenson for two hours in May of 2013. He\n\ndiagnosed her with “borderline intellectual functioning” and “major depressive\n\n[dis]order, single episode severe with psychotic features that is currently in full\n\nremission.” He opined that Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive impairment resulted from her\n\nhome environment, coupled with genetic predisposition, and that if her IQ were 4 to 6\n\npoints higher she still would fall within the borderline range of intellectual functioning.\n\nHe testified that Ms. Stevenson’s “relatively mild” exposure to lead was not a substantial\n\ncontributing factor to her cognitive impairment or to her depressive disorder.\n\n       Dr. Munro conducted a full-day neuropsychological evaluation of Ms. Stevenson,\n\non April 8, 2013, and interviewed Ms. Montgomery that day.             She measured Ms.\n\n                                            12\n\fStevenson’s full scale IQ to be 74, which is in the borderline range (between 70 and 79),\n\nand her verbal IQ to be 70. She testified that individuals within the borderline range of\n\nintelligence have not necessarily suffered any brain injury. The result of other tests she\n\nperformed were not consistent with Ms. Stevenson’s having suffered a brain injury.\n\n       Dr. Munro diagnosed Ms. Stevenson with borderline intellectual functioning and\n\nmajor depressive disorder, in partial remission. She opined that genetic factors played “a\n\nlarge role” in Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive impairment and that her evaluation of Ms.\n\nStevenson revealed no evidence that she had brain damage caused by a toxic exposure.\n\nDr. Munro did not diagnose Ms. Stevenson with ADHD or any attention deficit disorder.\n\nShe explained that, because Ms. Stevenson had depression, and because depression\n\naffects attention, she could not make an attention deficit diagnosis. Moreover, she was\n\nnot convinced that Ms. Stevenson ever should have been diagnosed with ADHD, given\n\nthat the initial diagnosis at KKI was based largely on a questionnaire completed by Ms.\n\nMontgomery and, at the time of her diagnosis, Ms. Stevenson was not getting adequate\n\nsleep, which could have caused her attention difficulties.\n\n       Dr. Sheller met with Ms. Stevenson and Ms. Montgomery a few months before the\n\nFirst Trial and reviewed Ms. Stevenson’s medical records. He diagnosed Ms. Stevenson\n\nwith borderline intellectual functioning. Based upon his review of scientific studies\n\nabout the neurological impact of blood lead levels similar to Ms. Stevenson’s, he opined\n\nthat she may have lost one to two IQ points as a result of her lead exposure. He testified\n\nthat a difference of between one and six IQ points will not have any apparent effect on\n\ncognitive functioning. He noted that Ms. Stevenson’s half-sister was evaluated at KKI\n\n                                            13\n\fwhen she was 5 years old and that KKI could not rule out ADHD. He opined that there is\n\n“a very powerful genetic link” for ADHD and, given that Ms. Stevenson’s mother, half-\n\nbrother, father, and possibly her half-sister also have attention difficulties, it is not\n\nsurprising that Ms. Stevenson has deficits in that area.     He further opined that the\n\nmajority of children outgrow ADHD symptoms in adulthood.\n\n      The case was sent to the jury on a special verdict that listed the following\n\nquestions:\n\n             1. Do you find that [the Fairview Property] contained chipping,\n      flaking, or peeling paint at the beginning of the tenancy?\n             2. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that there was flaking, chipping and/or peeling lead-based\n      paint at [the Fairview Property] during the relevant time period?\n             3. Do you find that Defendant, S&S Partnership acted negligently in\n      its ownership and/or management of [the Fairview Property] during the\n      relevant time period?\n             4. Do you find that Defendant, Dear . . . acted negligently in its\n      management of [the Fairview Property] during the relevant time period?\n             5. Do you find that Defendant, . . . [Mr.] Rochkind, acted negligently\n      in his ownership/operation of [the Fairview Property] during the relevant\n      time period?\n             6. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that she suffered injury as a result of lead exposure at [the\n      Fairview Property]?\n             7. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that she should be awarded non-economic damages?\n             8. What amount of damages, if any, do you award [Ms. Stevenson]\n      as damages for her non-economic losses?\n             9. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that she has suffered economic damages?\n             10. What amount of damages, if any, do you award [Ms. Stevenson]\n      as damages for economic damages?\n\n      On March 18, 2014, the jurors returned their verdict. They answered questions 1\n\nthrough 7 and question 9 in the affirmative. On question 8, they awarded Ms. Stevenson\n\n\n                                           14\n\f$539,000 in non-economic damages and, on question 10, they awarded her $829,000 in\n\neconomic damages.\n\n       Within ten days, Mr. Rochkind, S&S, and Dear moved to alter or amend or for a\n\nnew trial or remittitur. As relevant here, they argued that the court erred by permitting\n\nMr. Lieberman to express an opinion at trial that was not disclosed in discovery, and by\n\npermitting Dr. Conte to rely upon that new opinion to himself offer a new opinion. On\n\nApril 28, 2014, the court heard argument on the defendants’ motions.7 It ruled that Dr.\n\nConte’s trial testimony was a new opinion never disclosed in discovery and that its\n\nadmission had “unfair[ly] disadvantage[d]” the defense.8 On that basis, it granted a new\n\ntrial on economic damages. Because the jurors’ assessment of non-economic damages\n\nmay have been “skewed” due to their award of economic damages, the court also granted\n\nthe defendants a new trial on non-economic damages. The court ruled that the jurors’\n\nfindings with respect to liability would stand.\n\n       On the first day of the Second Trial, Judge White denied the defendants’ renewed\n\nmotions in limine pertaining to Mr. Lieberman and Drs. Hall-Carrington and Conte. In\n\nher case, Ms. Stevenson testified and called five witnesses from the First Trial: Dr. Kraft,\n\n\n       7\n         On April 25, 2014, Judge Sfekas held a hearing and granted a partial new trial.\nMs. Stevenson argued, pursuant to Rule 2-311(e), that because the court had not\npermitted her counsel to present any argument on the motions at that proceeding, it could\nnot grant a partial new trial. The court agreed that it had acted improperly and vacated its\nruling. It scheduled a new hearing on the motions for April 28, 2014.\n       8\n        The court did not find that Mr. Lieberman’s trial testimony included any new\nopinions not disclosed during discovery.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fMr. Lieberman, Dr. Hall-Carrington, Dr. Conte, and Ms. Montgomery. She also called\n\ntwo new lay witnesses: Alice Crowder, a DORS employee; and Jamie Weaver, Ms.\n\nStevenson’s supervisor at the Royal Farms store.\n\n       The testimony of Ms. Stevenson, Ms. Montgomery, Dr. Kraft, and Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington did not differ from their testimony in the First Trial.\n\n       Mr. Lieberman, who had met with Ms. Stevenson in the interim between the trials,\n\nopined, as he had at the first trial, that her cognitive deficits made her employable only in\n\n“very low skill positions requiring limited independent decision making, limited ability to\n\nread and remember information and require a high level of supervision.” These jobs\n\nwould be part-time, involve “unskilled manual labor,” and pay “at or near minimum\n\nwage.” Mr. Lieberman reiterated his opinion that Ms. Stevenson would require the\n\nservices of a job coach for “a couple hours a week” in order to maintain employment. He\n\ntestified that a job coach typically charges $38 per hour.\n\n       Dr. Conte offered a new economic loss opinion at the Second Trial. In making his\n\ncalculations, he assumed that Ms. Stevenson had a work-life expectancy of 32.5 years,\n\nthat she would be employable in minimum-wage jobs working approximately 25 to 30\n\nhours per week, and that she would require a job coach to maintain employment. He\n\ncompared her lifetime earnings in that scenario to the lifetime earnings of an “African-\n\nAmerican high school graduate.” Based upon those assumptions, he opined that, “absent\n\nthe deficits” described by Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Stevenson could have earned $1,595,114\n\nover her lifetime. In contrast, her potential lifetime earnings with her deficits would be a\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f“net” “negative earnings” once the cost of job coaching was factored in. Therefore, the\n\nvalue of her lost wages and benefits was the full $1,595,114.\n\n       Ms. Crowder is a technical specialist with DORS, who assists youths with\n\ndisabilities to transition into adulthood. She testified that she worked with Ms. Stevenson\n\nfor about three years, helping her to obtain training and employment. Ordinarily, once a\n\nDORS client finds a job and maintains employment for 90 days, the client’s case is\n\nclosed. A DORS client who has “difficulty on the job” may contact DORS and request\n\npost-employment services, which might include job coaching or other services to help the\n\nclient maintain employment. Ms. Crowder testified that Ms. Stevenson had been advised\n\nthat she was eligible for supplemental security income (“SSI”) benefits and that that\n\nmade her eligible for DORS services cost-free.\n\n       Ms. Weaver testified that she worked at the Royal Farms store in Morrell Park for\n\neight years and was the manager for three years, including when Ms. Stevenson worked\n\nthere in 2012. She characterized Ms. Stevenson’s job performance as “okay,” noting that\n\nshe “had to instruct her on what to do on a daily basis.” Ms. Stevenson’s attendance was\n\n“[f]air.” When Ms. Stevenson worked at the cash register, she “seemed confused, like\n\nshe was a new employee every day.” She had a “[g]reat attitude” but did not retain skills.\n\nShe could not be rehired at Royal Farms because the company has a “no rehire policy.”\n\n       In his case, Mr. Rochkind again called Drs. Blumberg, Munro, and Scheller and\n\nalso called two new witnesses: Michael Brookshire, Ph.D, an economist, and Robert\n\nTaylor, a rehabilitation counselor.\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       Dr. Blumberg’s testimony was for the most part the same as his testimony in the\n\nFirst Trial. He modified his diagnosis of Ms. Stevenson slightly, based upon records he\n\nhad reviewed in the interim between the trials. He explained that he originally had\n\ndiagnosed Ms. Stevenson with a single episode of major depression that was now in full\n\nremission, but he now believed her major depressive disorder to be recurrent.\n\n       Drs. Munro and Scheller testified consistent with their testimony in the First Trial.\n\nDr. Munro elaborated on her view that Ms. Stevenson’s impaired cognitive functioning\n\nwas caused by her genetic predisposition, coupled with her chaotic home environment\n\nand depressive disorder, and not by lead exposure.\n\n       Mr. Taylor was accepted by the court as an expert in vocational rehabilitation\n\ncounseling. He testified, based upon Ms. Stevenson’s vocational history and Dr. Munro’s\n\nreport, that Ms. Stevenson is capable of working full-time in a number of jobs, including\n\nas a food service worker, housekeeper, childcare worker, and in certain clerical jobs. In\n\nhis view, she could earn more than the federal minimum wage in these jobs, estimating\n\nan income of between $18,000 and $21,000 a year. He opined that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\ninjuries linked to her exposure to lead had not resulted in any loss in earning capacity.\n\nRather, her “significant barriers” to employment arose from other “confounding\n\nvariables” in her life.\n\n       Dr. Brookshire testified that Ms. Stevenson had not “sustained any loss of earning\n\ncapacity or work-life expectancy due to claimed exposure to lead” and there were\n\n“significant other issues that would have affected her academic and vocational\n\noutcomes.” He opined that there was “no difference” between Ms. Stevenson’s “pre- and\n\n                                            18\n\f. . . post-injury earning capacity due to lead exposure” and the “total cost of additional\n\nrehabilitation services” required to assist her in finding full-time employment was in the\n\nrange of $3,453 to $6,036.\n\n       At the conclusion of all the evidence, the jurors were asked to find the amount, if\n\nany, of economic and non-economic damages Ms. Stevenson sustained as a result of her\n\nexposure to lead-based paint at the Fairview Property. On November 3, 2014, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict awarding Ms. Stevenson $753,000 in economic damages and $700,000\n\nin non-economic damages.\n\n       Within ten days, Mr. Rochkind, S&S, and Dear moved for new trial or, in the\n\nalternative, for a remittitur, and, on December 10, 2014, Ms. Stevenson filed a motion for\n\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n       On March 18, 2015, the court entered an order denying the motion for attorneys’\n\nfees. Within ten days, Ms. Stevenson moved for reconsideration of that order. On June\n\n8, 2015, the court denied that motion.\n\n       Meanwhile, on April 2, 2015, the court denied the motion for new trial. The court\n\nreduced the judgment in accordance with the cap on non-economic damages and entered\n\nan amended judgment in the amount of $1,103,000.\n\n       On April 29, 2015, Rochkind noted this timely appeal. S&S and Dear did not note\n\nappeals.9\n\n\n       9\n         In her original complaint and her first amended complaint, Ms. Stevenson\nalleged exposure to lead paint hazards and resulting injury at four other properties and\n\n                                                                           (Continued…)\n                                           19\n\f(…continued)\nsued the owners of those properties as well. She alleged that the Mayor & City Council\nof Baltimore City (“Mayor & City Council”) and Edgewood Management Corporation\n(“Edgewood”), owned and/or managed the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, where she\nlived for about a year after she moved out of the Fairview Property. She alleged that the\nHousing Authority of Baltimore City (“HABC”) owned two properties located at 1308\nHillman Street and 424 Oxford Court, where she lived from 1994 to 1996, and 1996 to\n1998, respectively. Finally, she alleged that Lawrence Polakoff owned a property located\nat 1809 Raynor Avenue, where she lived from 1998 until 1999.\n        On June 19, 2012, about a month after she filed her first amended complaint, Ms.\nStevenson filed a notice of “Partial Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice” as to her\nclaims against the Mayor & City Council and Edgewood, neither of which had been\nserved. On November 29, 2012, Mr. Polakoff was served by private process. On\nDecember 3, 2012, HABC was served and, on December 12, 2012, it filed an answer.\nTwo months later, on February 20, 2013, Ms. Stevenson and HABC filed a joint\n“Stipulation of Dismissal Without Prejudice” as to the claims against HABC. The record\ndoes not reflect that the claims against Mr. Polakoff ever were dismissed.\n        Ordinarily, a judgment that “adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action . .\n. or . . . less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer\nthan all the parties to the action” is not final and appealable. Md. Rule 2-602(a). In the\ninstant case, the claims against Mr. Polakoff remain outstanding and the judgment is not\nfinal.\n        Rule 2-602(b) permits a circuit court, in its discretion, to “direct . . . the entry of a\nfinal judgment . . . as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties” upon a\nfinding that there is “no just reason for delay.” Factors relevant to the exercise of that\ndiscretion include: “‘a harsh economic effect’ caused by delaying the right to appeal”;\n“the danger that the same issues will have to be considered by the appellate court on\nsuccessive appeals”; “the possibility that ‘the determination of the remaining [issues]\nbefore the trial court might utterly moot the need for the review now being sought’”; and\n“‘whether entertaining the present appeal upon the merits would require us to determine\nquestions that are still before the trial court.’” Doe v. Sovereign Grace Ministries, 217\nMd. App. 650, 667 (2014) (citations omitted).\n        Pursuant to Rule 8-602(e), if this Court “determines that the order from which the\nappeal is taken was not a final judgment when the notice of appeal was filed but that the\nlower court had discretion to direct the entry of a final judgment pursuant to Rule 2-\n602(b), the appellate court may, as it finds appropriate, . . . enter a final judgment on its\nown initiative.” We exercise our discretion to do so in the instant case. The factors\nweighing against the certification of a final judgment do not apply in this case and the\ncircuit court plainly would have had discretion to certify the judgment against Mr.\nRochkind, S&S, and Dear as final. The claims against Mr. Polakoff were not a part of\n\n                                                                                 (Continued…)\n                                               20\n\f       Ms. Stevenson noted a timely cross-appeal from the denial of her motion for\n\nattorneys’ fees and the denial of the motion for reconsideration thereof.\n\n       We shall include additional facts as necessary to our analysis of the issues.\n\n                                         APPEAL\n\n                                             I.\n\n                                    Partial New Trial\n\n       In the course of this litigation, Dr. Conte prepared several reports in which he\n\nopined about Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings. In a report prepared in June of 2013,\n\nhe calculated Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings to be $1,010,319. Following a pre-\n\ntrial evidentiary hearing on January 21, 2014, the court precluded Dr. Conte from\n\nexpressing that opinion at trial because it was based upon the Gibson & Gamboa work-\n\nlife expectancy tables, which the court found are not generally accepted in the economic\n\ncommunity. On January 22, 2014, Dr. Conte issued a new report opining that Ms.\n\nStevenson had sustained $556,413 in lost future earnings. He withdrew that report,\n\nhowever, and issued his final report on February 2, 2014. In it, he calculated Ms.\n\nStevenson’s lost future earnings to be $716,803. In doing so, he relied on the Millimet\n\nwork-life expectancy tables, which he applied by placing Ms. Stevenson in the category\n\nfor individuals having less than a high school degree.\n\n(…continued)\nthe First Trial or the Second Trial. He was not a party to any of the pre-trial proceedings.\nWe see no justification for further delaying the resolution of this appeal. Accordingly,\nwe shall direct the entry of a final judgment against Mr. Rochkind, S&S, and Dear\npursuant to Rule 8-602(e).\n\n\n                                             21\n\f       The defense moved to preclude Dr. Conte from expressing the opinion in his\n\nFebruary 2, 2014 report at trial. The court held a hearing on the motion at the outset of\n\nthe First Trial. It denied the motion, ruling that Dr. Conte’s use of the Millimet tables\n\nwas permissible, but directed that he place Ms. Stevenson in the category for high school\n\ngraduates in applying those tables.\n\n       At trial, Dr. Conte testified that he had relied on Mr. Lieberman’s expert\n\nvocational opinion in reaching his opinion about Ms. Stevenson’s potential future\n\nearnings and loss of future earnings. Mr. Lieberman had opined that even though Ms.\n\nStevenson graduated from high school, she would not be able to obtain the same jobs as\n\nan “average high school graduate” or command the same pay. Based on this opinion, Dr.\n\nConte testified, for the first time, that\n\n       had Ms. Stevenson not suffered from the cognitive deficits that she\n       currently displays, that she would be able to compete in the labor market\n       and command a salary of a typical high school graduate; but that because of\n       what she’s been through, she is most likely to be working in jobs that can\n       command only a minimum wage.\n\nDr. Conte calculated that, “absent her current deficits,” Ms. Stevenson could earn an\n\nannual salary of “$29,743 with relevant growth . . . which reflects the average salary of\n\nan African-American high school graduate in the U.S. economy” according to federal\n\ngovernment statistics. At a minimum wage job, however, Ms. Stevenson would earn just\n\n$15,080 annually.         He further calculated fringe benefits—including insurance,\n\nsupplemental pay, paid leave, retirement contributions, and mandatory contributions—at\n\n44.3% of salary. Based on these calculations, Dr. Conte opined that, as an “average high\n\nschool graduate,” Ms. Stevenson could have earned $1,636,459 in wages and fringe\n\n                                            22\n\fbenefits over her lifetime, but as an individual earning only the minimum wage she\n\nwould earn $806,753 over her lifetime. The difference between those two figures—\n\n$829,706—was Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings.\n\n       The court ruled that this opinion had not been disclosed to the defendants in\n\ndiscovery and amounted to an unfair surprise. It ordered a partial new trial, explaining as\n\nfollows with regard to the issues to be retried:\n\n       [T]he testimony in the case was that Ms. Stevenson had an elevated blood-\n       level, that she lived at [the Fairview Property] for that period of time, and I\n       think I’m not granting a new trial as to that issue. . . . .\n               There will be no need, in a new trial, for testimony by either ARC or\n       [Dr. Simon]. . . . .\n               [The plaintiff will not] need to establish (a) that there was lead in the\n       household; (b) that [Ms. Stevenson] was exposed to the lead in the\n       household; (c) that she had an elevated lead level; and, (d) that the lead\n       level that she had was, to a Substantial degree, the result of the exposure at\n       that house. I think the jury had conclusively decided that. I’m going to let\n       that portion stand.\n               Therefore, the only issue that will be available for retrial will be:\n       economic damages, non-economic damages and, of course, in both cases\n       that will depend upon some analysis of the degree of injury to which she\n       was subject. In other words, you know, the five to six point loss in IQ and\n       the vocational impact that that would have had. As I said, I think there\n       needs to be a proportional – some proportionate distribution of the damages\n       as well, ok?\n\n       At the outset of the Second Trial, Judge White advised the parties that she had\n\nreviewed the verdict sheet from the First Trial and the transcripts of the hearings on the\n\nmotion for new trial, and it was “absolutely apparent [to her] that the issues that [would\n\nbe] going forward to the jury [in the Second Trial were] questions numbered 8 and 10 on\n\nthe old verdict sheet.” Those questions asked the jurors to determine the amount, if any,\n\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fof economic and non-economic damages to be awarded. Judge White stated that “[t]he\n\ncausation issues were resolved by the first jury.”\n\n       Mr. Rochkind (joined by S&S and Dear) argued that Judge White’s reading of\n\nJudge Sfekas’s ruling on the motion for new trial was too narrow. He maintained that he\n\nshould be permitted to present evidence that Ms. Stevenson’s injuries could be the result\n\nof a “lot of things going on in [her] life,” not just lead exposure. He argued, moreover,\n\nthat he should be able to present evidence and argue to the jury that Ms. Stevenson was\n\nnot “damaged by this very modest level of lead exposure.”\n\n       Judge White stated that she did not anticipate limiting the defendants’ right to\n\ncross-examine Ms. Stevenson’s experts or to present their own expert testimony bearing\n\non “the nature of the injury and the severity of the injury.” She precluded Mr. Rochkind\n\nfrom relitigating the issue of “causation . . . as to whether it was the Defendants’ lead that\n\ncaused the injury; i.e., the lead exposure and elevated blood-lead levels.” Thus, the only\n\nissues at the Second Trial would be “quantification of damages with attention to nature of\n\ninjury, severity of the injury.”\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Rochkind contends Judge Sfekas abused his discretion by granting\n\nonly a partial new trial. He maintains that the issues of liability and damages were not\n\n“fairly severable,” and therefore the only effective remedy for Dr. Conte’s having\n\nexpressed an opinion not disclosed before trial, to the prejudice of the defense, was a new\n\ntrial on all issues. He further contends that Judge White erred by “limiting the scope of\n\nthe [Second Trial] to damages only, despite the fact that the issues of liability and\n\ndamages were inextricably intertwined.” He argues that he should have been permitted to\n\n                                             24\n\fintroduce evidence and argue at the Second Trial that Ms. Stevenson’s “damages were\n\ncaused by lead from other properties or ambient sources.” (Emphasis in original.)\n\n       Ms. Stevenson responds that Mr. Rochkind did not preserve this issue for review\n\nbecause he did not file a motion for reconsideration of Judge Sfekas’s or Judge White’s\n\nrulings. On the merits, she argues that the issue of damages was fairly severable from the\n\nliability issues, and therefore a new trial solely on damages was a proper remedy, and\n\nJudge White correctly limited the scope of the Second Trial to the “nature, extent, degree\n\nand quantification of the injuries.”\n\n       There is no merit in Ms. Stevenson’s preservation argument. Judge Sfekas’s order\n\ngranting a partial new trial was interlocutory and only could be challenged on appeal\n\nfrom the final judgment entered after the partial new trial. See Buck v. Cam’s Broadloom\n\nRugs, Inc., 328 Md. 51, 56 (1992).         Mr. Rochkind was not required to move for\n\nreconsideration of the denial of his motion for new trial on liability to preserve his\n\nchallenge to that adverse ruling. Nor was he required to move for reconsideration of\n\nJudge White’s ruling on the scope of the new trial to challenge that ruling on appeal.\n\n       Rule 2-533(c) permits a court to “set aside all or part of any judgment entered and\n\ngrant a new trial to all or any of the parties and on all of the issues, or some of the issues\n\nif the issues are fairly severable.” Mr. Rochkind relies on Stickley v. Chisholm, 136 Md.\n\nApp. 305 (2001), to support his argument that Judge Sfekas abused his discretion by\n\ngranting a partial new trial rather than a new trial on all issues because the issues of\n\nliability and damages were not “fairly severable.”\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       In Stickley, a jury in a medical malpractice case found that the defendant doctor\n\nhad breached the standard of care but his breach was not “the” proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiff’s injury. On appeal, we held that the trial court erred by instructing the jurors\n\nthat to find in favor of the plaintiff on proximate causation the doctor’s breach had to be\n\nthe sole cause of the plaintiff’s injury.    Invoking Rule 8-604(b), which permits an\n\nappellate court to reverse, in part, and affirm, in part, a judgment if it determines “that\n\nerror affects a severable part of the action,” the plaintiff sought to have the case remanded\n\nfor a partial new trial on causation and damages only. Id. at 316.\n\n       We declined to do so, concluding that for this Court to remand for a partial new\n\ntrial “‘it must clearly appear that the effect of the error did not extend to all the issues\n\ntried.’” Id. at 317 (quoting McBride v. Huckins, 81 A. 528, 531, 532 (N.H. 1911)). We\n\nobserved that the jurors may have compromised by finding in favor of the plaintiff on\n\nbreach of the standard of care and in favor of the doctor on causation; and that “the issues\n\nof negligence and proximate cause are . . . intricately intertwined[.]”      Id. at 317–18.\n\nBecause it was not clear “that the effect of the erroneous jury instruction was limited to\n\nthe issue of causation,” we remanded for a new trial on all issues. Id. at 317–318.\n\n       In the case at bar, the jurors in the First Trial found that Ms. Stevenson was\n\nexposed to deteriorated lead-based paint at the Fairview Property; the exposure was a\n\nsubstantial contributing factor causing her elevated blood lead levels; and Mr. Rochkind\n\n(and S&S and Dear) violated their duty of care by failing to maintain that property so\n\noccupants would not be exposed to deteriorated lead-based paint. Those findings and the\n\nevidence bearing on them were distinct from the medical issues pertaining to whether Ms.\n\n                                             26\n\fStevenson’s elevated blood lead levels resulted in a decrease in her IQ and in ADHD.\n\nPure damages evidence, such as Dr. Conte’s expert opinion about lost future earnings,\n\nwas even farther removed from the duty and source of lead evidence, and it was Ms.\n\nStevenson’s failure to timely disclose that damages opinion that was the sole ground on\n\nwhich the new trial motion was granted. Judge Sfekas did not abuse his discretion by\n\nruling that the damages issues were severable from the liability issues.\n\n       Finally, Judge White did not misinterpret Judge Sfekas’s ruling or abuse her\n\ndiscretion in limiting the scope of the Second Trial to the issues of economic and non-\n\neconomic damages. Mr. Rochkind was given wide latitude to present evidence bearing\n\non the nature and degree of Ms. Stevenson’s injuries and their causes, including expert\n\ntestimony of Drs. Blumberg, Munro, and Sheller that Ms. Stevenson’s impaired cognitive\n\nfunction and ADHD resulted from genetic predisposition, not from lead exposure. The\n\ncourt properly restricted Mr. Rochkind from arguing that Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood\n\nlead levels, and resulting injuries, were caused by lead exposure at other properties or\n\nfrom ambient lead.\n\n                                            II.\n\n                                  Dr. Hall-Carrington\n\n       Before the First Trial, Mr. Rochkind filed four motions in limine seeking to\n\npreclude Dr. Hall-Carrington from expressing at trial one source of lead causation\n\nopinion and three medical causation opinions. Specifically, he moved to preclude Dr.\n\nHall-Carrington from opining that the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing\n\nfactor in causing Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels and from opining that Ms.\n\n                                            27\n\fStevenson’s exposure to lead, as manifested by her elevated blood lead levels, caused\n\n“cognitive defects” and “behavioral problems,” the loss of a specific number of IQ\n\npoints, and ADHD.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind requested Frye-Reed hearings on each motion. Judge Sfekas denied\n\nthat request. On January 13, 2014, he heard argument on the motions in limine and\n\ndenied them. Before the Second Trial, Mr. Rochkind renewed his motions in limine.\n\nJudge White heard argument on the first day of the Second Trial and denied the motions\n\nas well.\n\nA. Expert Testimony Generally\n\n       Rule 5-702 provides that a court may admit expert testimony if the court\n\n       determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the\n       evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the\n       court “shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by\n       knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness\n       of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a\n       sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\n\n       The decision to admit or exclude expert testimony under Rule 5-702 is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Rollins v. State, 392 Md. 455, 500 (2006). A court’s “action in\n\nadmitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.”\n\nBryant v. State, 393 Md. 196, 203 (2006) (citations omitted). Thus, we must uphold the\n\ncourt’s decision to admit Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion testimony “unless we conclude\n\nthat [the court] acted arbitrarily or capriciously . . . or that ‘no reasonable person would\n\nshare the view taken by the [court].’” Taylor v. Fishkind, 207 Md. App. 121, 137 (2012),\n\n\n\n\n                                            28\n\fcert denied, 431 Md. 221 (2013) (quoting Brown v. Daniel Realty Co., 409 Md. 565, 601\n\n(2009)) (alteration in Taylor).\n\n       Expert testimony that is based on a novel scientific method also must satisfy the\n\ngeneral acceptance test of Frye-Reed to be admissible. See Frye v. United States, 293 F.\n\n1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923); Reed v. State, 283 Md. 374, 389 (1978) (adopting the Frye\n\nstandard). Under that test, the proponent of the expert testimony must show that it is\n\n“based on a scientific method or principle that has gained general acceptance in the\n\nrelevant scientific community.” Ross v. Housing Authority of Baltimore City, 430 Md.\n\n648, 660 n.10 (2013). The “general acceptance” test is an assessment of the validity and\n\nreliability of a given scientific method or principle. Blackwell v. Wyeth, 408 Md. 575,\n\n585 (2009). If the “validity and reliability of a scientific technique [or principle] [is] . . .\n\nbroadly and generally accepted in the scientific community,” a court may take judicial\n\nnotice of its reliability. Reed, 283 Md. at 380. If that is not the case, “the reliability\n\n[must] be demonstrated before testimony based on the technique [or principle] can be\n\nintroduced into evidence.” Id.        In this way, Frye-Reed is “deliberately intended to\n\ninterpose a substantial obstacle to the unrestrained admission of evidence based upon new\n\nscientific principles.” Id. at 386 (citation omitted).\n\nB. Dr. Hall-Carrington’s Source of Lead Causation Opinion\n\n       Dr. Hall-Carrington is a practicing pediatrician who has been assessing children\n\nfor lead exposure for over twenty years. At both trials, she explained that the most\n\ncommon way in which young children are exposed to lead is by ingestion of lead-based\n\npaint chips, flakes, and dust.\n\n                                              29\n\f       Dr. Hall-Carrington opined that the Fairview Property was a substantial\n\ncontributing factor causing Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels. In preparation\n\nfor trial, she reviewed Ms. Stevenson’s and Ms. Montgomery’s answers to interrogatories\n\nand deposition testimony; Dr. Simon’s report; a printout from the State Department of\n\nAssessments and Taxation for the Fairview Property; and the Arc report about the\n\nFairview Property.     She based her source of lead opinion on Ms. Montgomery’s\n\ntestimony that there was deteriorated paint at the Fairview Property and that Ms.\n\nStevenson had engaged in hand-to-mouth activities in the vicinity of the deteriorating\n\npaint at that property; the Arc report confirming the presence of lead-based paint in\n\nnumerous interior areas of that property; and Ms. Montgomery’s interrogatory answers,\n\nfrom which other possible sources of lead, including the 2114 Clifton Property, the 2110\n\nClifton Property, the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, and environmental sources of lead,\n\nsuch as fishing weights and glazed pottery, could be ruled out.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind contends that the court abused its discretion by allowing Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington to opine about the source of Ms. Stevenson’s lead exposure. He complains\n\nthat Dr. Hall-Carrington “is a pediatrician, not a lead risk assessor” and she did not\n\nperform any tests on the Fairview Property or “investigate other known, potential sources\n\nof lead exposure.” He relies upon Taylor v. Fishkind, supra, Ross v. Housing Authority,\n\nsupra, Hamilton v. Dackman, 213 Md. App. 589 (2013), cert. denied, 439 Md. 329\n\n(2014), and Roy v. Dackman, 445 Md. 23 (2015), to argue that Dr. Hall-Carrington was\n\nnot qualified to offer a lead source causation opinion because she failed to “rule out all\n\nother possible sources of lead.”\n\n                                            30\n\f      Ms. Stevenson responds that, as a pediatrician practicing in Baltimore City and\n\nassessing children for lead exposure, Dr. Hall-Carrington was qualified to opine that the\n\nFairview Property was a substantial contributing cause of her elevated blood lead levels.\n\nShe argues that Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion was supported by an adequate factual\n\nfoundation because, unlike the cases on which Mr. Rochkind relies, here, there was direct\n\nevidence of lead-based paint in more than twenty locations inside the Fairview Property.\n\nThat direct evidence, coupled with Ms. Montgomery’s deposition testimony and Dr.\n\nSimon’s report, amply supported Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion that the lead-based paint\n\nknown to be present at the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing factor\n\ncausing Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels.\n\n      In Roy v. Dackman, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court in a lead paint\n\ncase did not abuse its discretion by precluding the plaintiff’s expert pediatrician from\n\noffering opinions at trial about the source of the lead the plaintiff was exposed to.10 In\n\nthat case, there was no direct evidence of the presence of lead paint inside the subject\n\nproperty and the expert’s source of lead opinion “was based solely on scant\n\ncircumstantial evidence, including the age of the home and exterior tests of the paint on\n\nthe dwelling.” Id. at 47. The Court observed that “it is not enough for an expert to\n\nconclude that a certain property is the source of the child’s exposure to lead when other\n\nprobable sources have not been eliminated”; and the expert’s proffered testimony did not\n\n      10\n         As we shall discuss below, the Court also addressed whether the trial court\nabused its discretion by precluding the same expert from testifying about medical\ncausation.\n\n\n                                           31\n\frule out other probable sources. Id. at 47-48. The Court held that in the absence of direct\n\nevidence of the presence of lead-based paint in the subject property and of evidence\n\nruling out other probable lead sources, the expert “was not competent to testify as to the\n\nsource of [the plaintiff’s] exposure.” Id. at 47.\n\n       The Roy Court explained that its holding regarding the expert’s competency to\n\ntestify about source of lead was in keeping with its decision in Ross v. Housing Authority,\n\nsupra, in which it upheld the trial court’s ruling precluding the plaintiff’s pediatrician\n\nexpert from giving a source of lead opinion when there was no direct evidence of lead-\n\nbased paint inside the subject property except on one stair riser; the only evidence of such\n\npaint on windows was for exterior windows and the expert was basing her opinion that\n\nlead-based paint was present at the subject property on the age of the house.\n\n       Roy, Ross, and the other cases Mr. Rochkind relies upon to argue that Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington should have been precluded from giving a source of lead opinion are\n\ndistinguishable. Here, there was direct evidence of the presence of lead-based paint\n\nthroughout the interior of the Fairview Property. Arc testing in 2012 revealed 22 interior\n\nsurfaces with lead-based paint. Dr. Hall-Carrington based her lead source causation\n\nopinion on the direct evidence of the presence of lead-based paint in the Fairview\n\nProperty; Dr. Simon’s opinion that because lead-based paint has been illegal to use in\n\nBaltimore City residences since 1978, the lead-based paint detected in the Fairview\n\nProperty in 2012 would have been present when Ms. Stevenson was living there, and that\n\nthe 2110 Clifton Property, the 2114 Clifton Property, and the Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nProperty were not sources of lead paint exposure; Ms. Montgomery’s testimony that the\n\n                                              32\n\fpaint inside the Fairview Property was deteriorated when she and Ms. Stevenson were\n\nliving there, and that she saw Ms. Stevenson put paint in her mouth; Ms. Montgomery’s\n\ndeposition testimony from which other environmental sources of lead, such as soil,\n\nleaded glazed pottery, and fishing weights, could be ruled out; and her own knowledge\n\nand expertise as a pediatrician with experience evaluating and treating children with lead\n\npoisoning. Compare with Taylor, 207 Md. App. at 141–42 (court’s ruling precluding\n\nopinion testimony by plaintiff’s lead source expert upheld when there was no direct\n\nevidence of lead-based paint inside the property, evidence only of such paint on one\n\nexterior window, and expert’s opinion was “pure speculation”); Hamilton, 213 Md. App.\n\nat 589 (court’s ruling precluding plaintiff’s lead source expert opinion upheld when there\n\nwas no direct evidence of lead-based paint in the property, there was only a positive\n\nfinding of lead paint on an exterior transom, and the expert was assuming that lead paint\n\nwas present due to the age of the property).\n\n       Dr. Hall-Carrington’s expert opinion about source of lead was not a\n\n“transform[ation of] thin evidence or assumptions into viable causal connections.”\n\nHamilton, 213 Md. App. at 608. Her opinion was grounded in fact, and the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by admitting it.\n\nC. Dr. Hall-Carrington’s Medical Causation Opinions\n\n       In preparation for the First and Second Trials, Dr. Hall-Carrington reviewed Ms.\n\nStevenson’s medical and school records, Dr. Kraft’s report, and the deposition testimony\n\nnoted above. She did not examine Ms. Stevenson or meet with her. She explained that\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fthat was not necessary because adults who have been exposed to lead as children\n\ntypically do not exhibit symptoms in a clinical examination.\n\n       In her testimony in both trials, Dr. Hall-Carrington detailed the ways in which lead\n\naffects brain development in young children. She recounted that scientific studies have\n\nconfirmed that there is a causal relationship between blood lead levels in excess of 10\n\nµg/dL in children and cognitive impairments and “externalizing behaviors.” She opined\n\nthat Ms. Stevenson sustained “brain impairment” from her exposure to lead; that “the\n\nextent of her injuries [had] affected her cognitive development, as well as her academic\n\nlevel of achievement”; and that she did not have other risk factors for cognitive\n\nimpairment, such as premature birth or head injury.          She further opined that Ms.\n\nStevenson’s “cognitive defects, . . . her academic achievement, and learning disabilities,”\n\nas well as her ADHD, were “caused” by her exposure to lead. She explained that anxiety\n\nand depression also “can be associated with exposure to lead” and that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nanxiety about school could have been caused by her poor academic performance and\n\ninability to focus. As noted, Dr. Hall-Carrington quantified Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive\n\nimpairment, opining that she lost between five and six IQ points as a result of lead\n\npoisoning. A factual “basis” for her medical causation opinion was the evidence that Ms.\n\nStevenson had ingested deteriorated lead-based paint at a “vulnerable age” when\n\nchildren’s brains are “more susceptible to the effects of lead.”\n\n       1) ADHD Opinion\n\n       In his motion in limine seeking to exclude Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion that Ms.\n\nStevenson’s exposure to lead-based paint caused her ADHD, Mr. Rochkind argued that\n\n                                             34\n\fthere is no consensus in the scientific community about the etiology of ADHD, much less\n\nthat exposure to lead in early childhood causes ADHD. Rather, the consensus is that\n\ngenetics plays a major role in ADHD. In support, he cited CDC reports, information on\n\nthe website of the National Resource Center on ADHD, a National Institute of Mental\n\nHealth (“NIMH”) report, and an article in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, all of\n\nwhich conclude that ADHD is a condition that runs in families.           In addition, he\n\nreferenced a 2008 article published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (“AAP”),\n\nwhich concludes that 80% of the etiology of ADHD is genetic, and described it as a\n\n“highly heritable disorder.”   He also cited a decision by a federal district court in\n\nOklahoma excluding an expert witness opinion that lead exposure causes ADHD. See\n\nPalmer v. Asarco, Inc., 510 F. Supp. 2d 519, 531 (N.D. Okla. 2007).11\n\n      In her opposition to the motion in limine, Ms. Stevenson argued that there is a\n\nconsensus in the scientific community that exposure to lead at or above certain levels\n\n“causes brain injury and other behavioral changes.” In support, she relied upon a 2013\n\npublication by the Environmental Protection Agency entitled “Integrated Science\n\n      11\n          In Palmer, the plaintiffs, seven children exposed to low levels of lead from\nmining waste at a superfund site, designated a psychologist to testify that lead exposure\nhad caused one of them to suffer from ADHD. (The others were not diagnosed with\nADHD.) The district court held a Daubert hearing and excluded the psychologist’s\nopinion. The court emphasized that the psychologist had not identified or referenced\n“any scientific literature showing that lead exposure can cause ADHD” and had cited a\n2002 CDC study finding “no compelling evidence that an [elevated blood lead level]\nincreases a child’s risk for [ADHD].” 510 F Supp. at 531 (alteration in original). The\ncourt noted, moreover, that the psychologist did not “state with any certainty how closely\nlead exposure and ADHD were related.” Id. Because the psychologist did not reference\nany scientific support for her opinion, the court ruled it inadmissible.\n\n\n                                           35\n\fAssessment for Lead” (“EPA-ISA”). The publication is the product of a team of scientists\n\nand technical experts and consists of analyses, based on peer reviewed medical\n\npublications and scientific studies, of the health effects of lead exposure. “The ISA\n\nprovides a concise review, synthesis, and evaluation of the most policy-relevant science\n\nto serve as a scientific foundation for the review of the National Ambient Air Quality\n\nStandards (NAAQS).” EPA-ISA at xliv. “The fundamental process for developing an\n\nISA includes . . . literature searches; . . . study selection; . . . evaluation and integration of\n\nthe evidence; and . . . development of scientific conclusions and causal judgments.” Id.\n\n       The EPA-ISA classifies numerous health conditions associated with lead exposure\n\ninto five categories: “Causal relationship,” “Likely to be a causal relationship,”\n\n“Suggestive of a causal relationship,” “Inadequate to infer a causal relationship,” and\n\n“Not likely to be a causal relationship.” Id. at lxii. In Table ES-1, the publication\n\nprovides a “[s]ummary of causal determinations for the relationship between exposure to\n\nPb and health effects.” Id. at lxxxiii. It concludes that in children there is a “[c]ausal\n\nrelationship” between exposure to certain levels of lead and the “Externalizing\n\nBehaviors” of “Attention, Impulsivity and Hyperactivity.” Id. At Section 4.3.15.2, the\n\npublication expounds upon that finding:\n\n       Attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity are evaluated together because\n       they are included within the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder domain\n       of externalizing behaviors (as reviewed in Whitcomb and Merrell, 2012).\n       Although examined less extensively than cognitive function, a causal\n       relationship between Pb exposure and attention decrements, impulsivity,\n       and hyperactivity in children is supported by multiple lines of evidence: 1)\n       findings from prospective studies in diverse populations for associations\n       with blood or tooth Pb levels; 2) coherence with evidence in animals with\n\n\n                                               36\n\f       relevant Pb exposures and; 3) evidence for plausible modes of action.\n       (Table 4-17).\n\nId. at 4-289 (emphasis in original).\n\n       Table 4-17, which appears at pages 4-311 through 4-323 of the EPA-ISA, details,\n\nin pertinent part, the associations found “from multiple, high quality epidemiologic\n\nstudies with relevant Pb levels,” identifying the studies by author, publication, and date,\n\ndescribing the supporting evidence, and specifying the “Pb Biomarker Levels Associated\n\nWith Effects.” Id. at 4-314. Those levels include in children “with age 30 months > 10\n\nµg/dL” of blood lead. The “modes of action,” meaning the ways in which lead exposure\n\nbrings about the detrimental externalizing behaviors are the same modes by which lead\n\nexposure brings about cognitive function decrements: impaired neuron development;\n\ndecrease in development of synapses; and changes in neurotransmitters.\n\n       The table sets forth the conclusions that there is a “Causal” relationship between\n\n“cognitive function decrements in children” and exposure to lead at low levels (in the\n\nrange of Ms. Stevenson’s blood lead levels); a “Causal” relationship between exposure to\n\nlead at low levels and “Externalizing Behaviors: Attention, Impulsivity, and\n\nHyperactivity in Children”; and a “Likely Causal” relationship between “Internalizing\n\nBehaviors in Children,” such as anxiety and depression, and exposure to low levels of\n\nlead. Id. at 4-311, 4-314, & 4-317.\n\n       Ms. Stevenson also cited in her opposition a 2005 “Policy Statement” about lead\n\nexposure in children by the AAP’s Committee on Environment Health. In a section of\n\nthe Policy Statement entitled “Toxicity of Lead,” the committee states that studies show\n\n\n                                            37\n\fthat exposure to lead causes IQ decrements in children and affects “other aspects of brain\n\nor nerve function, especially behavior.” Specifically, children with “elevated tooth lead\n\nconcentrations were more inattentive, hyperactive, disorganized, and less able to follow\n\ndirections”; and elevated “bone lead concentrations” has been associated with “increased\n\nattentional dysfunction.”\n\n       Ms. Stevenson maintained that she did not have to prove that her elevated blood\n\nlead levels were the only cause of her ADHD; she only had to prove substantial factor\n\ncausation. Moreover, she was not “required to rule out every other potential source or\n\ncause of ADHD or brain injury.” It was sufficient for Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that\n\nMs. Stevenson’s lead exposure “contributed to her ADHD.” Finally, Ms. Stevenson\n\nargued that her injuries, including ADHD, are “indivisible as a matter of law.” She\n\npointed to Dr. Hall-Carrington’s testimony in deposition that it is impossible to quantify\n\nhow much of her learning difficulties are due to lead exposure and how much are due to\n\nsocial factors.\n\n       As noted, the court denied the motions in limine. At trial, Dr. Hall-Carrington\n\nrelied upon the studies Ms. Stevenson cited in opposition to the motions and a study\n\nauthored by Bruce Lanphear (“the Lanphear Study”) to support her ADHD (and IQ)\n\nopinions.12\n\n\n\n       12\n          See Bruce Lanphear, et al, Low-Level Environmental Lead Exposure and\nChildren’s Intellectual Function: An International Pooled Analysis, 113 Envtl. Health\nPerspectives 894 (July 2005).\n\n\n                                           38\n\f       Before this Court, Mr. Rochkind offers three arguments as to why the court abused\n\nits discretion in admitting Dr. Hall-Carrington’s ADHD causation opinion. First, relying\n\nupon Blackwell, supra, he maintains that the trial court was required to hold a Frye-Reed\n\nhearing before ruling on the admissibility of Dr. Hall-Carrington’s ADHD causation\n\nopinion; and that the outcome of a Frye-Reed hearing should have been to preclude\n\nadmission of that opinion. Second, and relatedly, Mr. Rochkind asserts that Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington’s opinion as expressed at trial did not meet the threshold to prove general\n\nmedical causation, i.e., that low level lead exposure can cause ADHD. Finally, he\n\nmaintains that Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion was further deficient in that it failed to\n\nestablish specific medical causation, i.e., that her exposure in fact caused her to develop\n\nADHD. We do not find merit in any of these arguments.\n\n       In Blackwell, the plaintiff proposed to call Mark Geier, M.D., to opine that\n\nthimerosal, a preservative containing ethyl-mercury that is used in certain childhood\n\nvaccines, can cause autism in a “subset” of neurologically vulnerable children. 408 Md.\n\nat 611. The trial court held a Frye-Reed hearing. The defendant presented the findings of\n\nthe National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine’s (“IOM”) Committee reports\n\nfrom 2001 and 2004, the first of which concluded there is no evidence to support a link\n\nbetween thimerosal in vaccines and autism and the second of which concluded that the\n\nevidence favored “rejection of a causal relationship.” Id. at 599. These findings were\n\nbased on large scale epidemiological studies.\n\n       Dr. Geier was prepared to opine at trial, contrary to the IOM Committee reports,\n\nthat a causal relationship exists between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The\n\n                                            39\n\fonly basis for his opinion was his own “epidemiological analysis” of publically available\n\nvaccine data, and the only published epidemiological studies purporting to show such a\n\ncausal link had been undertaken by Dr. Geier and his son. Id. at 600. Those studies had\n\nbeen strongly criticized in the scientific community and were not generally accepted or\n\nreliable. Moreover, the scientific consensus was that autism is genetic in etiology except\n\nin rare instances and that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. Id. On that basis,\n\nthe trial court ruled at the conclusion of the Frye-Reed hearing that Dr. Geier’s causation\n\ntestimony was not admissible.      Without Dr. Geier’s expert opinion testimony, the\n\nplaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case, and the case was decided in favor of the\n\ndefendant as a matter of law.\n\n      The case reached the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. It explained that although\n\nDr. Geier’s “underlying data and methods for gathering this data [were] generally\n\naccepted in the scientific community,” he had “applied [that data] to support a novel\n\ntheory.” Id. at 596. Even if the underlying methodology was generally accepted, that did\n\nnot “mandate acceptance of conclusions ostensibly developed therefrom.” Id. at 589.\n\nThe Court gave as an example Wilson v. State, 370 Md. 191 (2002), in which it had held\n\nthat an expert witness for the State in a criminal prosecution should not have been\n\npermitted to opine that the statistical probability of two babies in the same family dying\n\nfrom SIDS with cerebral swelling was 1 in 4 million. The opinion had been offered to\n\nsupport the State’s theory that the death of the second baby was not caused by SIDS, but\n\nby shaken baby syndrome, i.e., that the defendant had shaken the baby to death. The 1 in\n\n4 million figure was arrived at by squaring the statistical rate of one baby dying from\n\n                                            40\n\fSIDS with cerebral swelling. The Court explained that there was a lively debate in the\n\nscientific community about the role of genetics in SIDS deaths and there was no scientific\n\nconsensus that there was not a genetic component to SIDS. Thus, although the statistical\n\nanalysis was based on sound methods, the conclusions drawn were not sufficiently\n\nreliable to satisfy the Frye-Reed general acceptance test.\n\n       The Blackwell Court noted that several federal courts have been called upon “to\n\nscrutinize the reliability of the analytical framework utilized by an expert in formulating\n\na novel theory of science.” 408 Md. at 605 (emphasis in original). In General Electric\n\nCompany v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997), the district court precluded the plaintiff’s expert\n\nwitness from opining that the plaintiff’s small cell lung cancer was caused by PCBs and\n\nPCB derivatives.    The Eleventh Circuit reversed, reasoning that experts may draw\n\n“different conclusions from the research,” and when they do, the issue is one for the jury\n\nto decide. Id. at 141. The Supreme Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari and\n\nreversed. Emphasizing that “conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from\n\none another[,]” the Court held that a trial court need not “admit opinion evidence that is\n\nconnected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert. A court may conclude that\n\nthere is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.”\n\nId. at 146. Such was the case with Dr. Geier’s opinion in Blackwell that thimerosal is\n\ncausally connected to autism.\n\n       The only similarity between Blackwell and the case at bar is that neither one\n\nconcerned the general reliability of a scientific method which is the usual circumstance\n\ncalling for a Frye-Reed hearing. Otherwise, the cases are entirely distinct, and the\n\n                                             41\n\fholding in Blackwell does not support the conclusion that the trial court in this case\n\nabused its discretion by not holding a Frye-Reed hearing.          Dr. Geier’s scientific\n\nconclusion, from his own epidemiologic studies, that the thimerisol in certain vaccines\n\ncauses autism had been universally rejected in the scientific community and, indeed, had\n\nbeen disproven through numerous other epidemiologic studies. To this day, scientists are\n\nsearching for the cause or causes of autism.\n\n       By contrast, for decades, beginning in the 1970s, it has been widely accepted that\n\nlead exposure at levels insufficient to produce acute illness nevertheless causes\n\ndeleterious health effects, especially cognitive deficits in children. Unlike in an autism\n\ncase like Blackwell, where the fundamental issue is whether there is any causal\n\nconnection between thimerisol exposure and autism, in lead paint cases such as this there\n\nis no controversy over the basic question whether lead paint exposure can cause health\n\ndeficits in children. Rather, the causation disputes concern which health deficits in\n\nchildren are caused by lead exposure and the level of exposure that will produce them.\n\n       As we have explained, Ms. Stevenson’s opposition to the motion in limine showed\n\nthat Dr. Hall-Carrington’s ADHD causation opinion was based on epidemiologic studies,\n\nmany of which were compiled and analyzed in the EPA-ISA and supported its finding of\n\na causal link between low-level lead exposure in children and the constellation of\n\nsymptoms that form ADHD.         Those studies used methodologies that are generally\n\naccepted and their conclusions were not novel in the sense used by the Court in\n\nBlackwell. In these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\na Frye-Reed hearing.\n\n                                               42\n\f       Mr. Rochkind’s related argument about general medical causation is based on his\n\nassertion that the EPA-ISA study is not in line with the consensus in the scientific\n\ncommunity that the cause of ADHD, although unknown, is primarily genetic. He points\n\nout that Dr. Hall-Carrington herself acknowledged that there is a “genetic component” to\n\nADHD and estimated that the condition is 60% hereditary. She also acknowledged that\n\nshe could not quantify the effect of genetics versus lead exposure on attention,\n\nimpulsivity, and hyperactive behaviors, but only could opine that lead exposure was\n\n“additive.”\n\n       Although the scientific studies and publications Mr. Rochkind cited support the\n\nview that ADHD is largely genetic, they do not rule out environmental causes, and some\n\nexpressly rule in lead as a risk factor. As we have explained, the EPA-ISA and other\n\nstudies Dr. Hall-Carrington relied upon support a causal relationship between lead\n\nexposure and ADHD.       The Court in Roy v. Dackman made clear that “even if [a\n\nparticular scientific] study is contrary to the results of other studies,” the fact that an\n\nexpert witness relies upon that study “does not invalidate the entire basis of his [or her]\n\nopinion.” 445 Md. at 51-52 n.16. Rather, “[s]uch is the grist for cross-examination and\n\ndueling experts and for resolution by the relative weight assigned by the fact-finder.” Id.\n\nat 52 n.16.\n\n       With respect to specific medical causation, Mr. Rochkind argues that Ms.\n\nStevenson’s family history of ADHD is a confounding factor that undermined the validity\n\nof any opinion that Ms. Stevenson’s ADHD was caused by exposure to lead. The trial\n\ncourt also did not abuse its discretion by permitting Dr. Hall-Carrington to testify that\n\n                                            43\n\fMs. Stevenson’s lead exposure was a specific cause of her ADHD symptoms. As noted,\n\nDr. Hall-Carrington testified that there is a large genetic component to ADHD, but that\n\nlead exposure is an additive causal factor. She acknowledged that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nmother had been diagnosed with ADHD, as had her half-brother. Her half-brother also\n\nhad been exposed to lead and had elevated blood lead levels, however. Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nhalf-sister had not been exposed to lead and had not been diagnosed with ADHD. 13 The\n\nissue of specific medical causation in this case is governed by the substantial factor test.\n\nDr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion that lead was a substantial causal factor contributing to Ms.\n\nStevenson’s ADHD symptoms was supported by an adequate factual basis and was\n\nsufficient to allow the jury to decide the causal connection, if any, between lead exposure\n\nand Ms. Stevenson’s ADHD.\n\n       2) IQ Loss Opinion\n\n       In his motion in limine seeking to exclude Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion\n\nquantifying Ms. Stevenson’s IQ loss, Mr. Rochkind argued that the doctor’s calculations\n\nwere not reliable under Frye-Reed and lacked an adequate factual basis under Rule 5-\n\n702(3). Specifically, he maintained that: 1) Dr. Hall-Carrington relied, improperly, on\n\ngeneral population studies to extrapolate that Ms. Stevenson had lost a specific number of\n\nIQ points; 2) there is no consensus in the scientific community about a methodology for\n\n       13\n           Mr. Rochkind’s experts noted that Ms. Stevenson’s half-sister had been\nevaluated for possible ADHD as a child, but was not diagnosed due, in large part, to the\nfact that she was then sleep-deprived. Dr. Munro opined that Ms. Stevenson’s diagnosis\nof ADHD at age 5 may have also resulted from the failure to rule out confounding\nfactors, such as sleep deprivation.\n\n\n                                            44\n\fcalculating IQ loss in a child exposed to lead; and 3) Dr. Hall-Carrington’s methodology\n\nof using Ms. Stevenson’s peak blood-lead level to calculate IQ loss was at odds with the\n\nvery studies she claimed to rely upon. He attached excerpts from Dr. Hall-Carrington’s\n\ndeposition testimony in which she could not explain why she had chosen to use Ms.\n\nStevenson’s peak blood-lead level, as opposed to her lifetime average, even though the\n\nLanphear Study, which she relied upon for her calculations, had used an average. She\n\nalso could not define the term “lifetime average” as used in the Lanphear Study, noting\n\nthat she was “not an epidemiologist.” As discussed, Judge Sfekas declined to hold a\n\nFrye-Reed hearing to assess the basis for Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinions and denied the\n\nmotion to exclude her IQ opinion.\n\n      At both trials, Dr. Hall-Carrington testified that she had reviewed epidemiologic\n\nstudies concerning the effects of lead on IQ decrements, and opined that there is\n\n“consensus among the studies that children do lose IQ points based on exposure to lead,”\n\nalthough studies “differ in the amount of IQ points that children lose.” Based on her\n\nreview of those studies, Dr. Hall-Carrington opined that, “within a reasonable degree of\n\nmedical certainty,” Ms. Stevenson lost between five and six IQ points as a result of her\n\nexposure to lead.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Hall-Carrington agreed that maternal and paternal IQ, a\n\nchaotic home environment, and moving between many residences and schools all are risk\n\nfactors for cognitive impairment in children. She did not have any information about Ms.\n\nMontgomery’s IQ or Ms. Stevenson’s father’s IQ, but did note that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nfather was in special education classes during his secondary education.             She\n\n                                          45\n\facknowledged that she had “no way of quantifying” the effect of confounding factors, if\n\nany, on Ms. Stevenson’s IQ. When asked whether she used Ms. Stevenson’s peak blood\n\nlead level (14 µg/dL) or her average blood-lead level (11.5 µg/dL) in forming her opinion\n\nabout the total IQ loss caused by lead exposure, she responded that, based upon the\n\nLanphear Study, she used Ms. Stevenson’s peak blood lead level and calculated an IQ\n\nloss of 3.9 points based upon a level of between zero and ten, 0-10 µg/dL and an\n\nadditional loss of 1.9 points for the level between 10 and 20 µg/dL, for a total of 5.8. She\n\nexplained that her opinion would not have changed if she had used Ms. Stevenson’s\n\naverage blood lead level.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind argues that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Dr.\n\nHall-Carrington to opine that Ms. Stevenson lost a specific number of IQ points as a\n\nresult of lead exposure because the doctor relied on general population studies to form\n\nthat opinion and because she had no experience administering or interpreting IQ test\n\nscores. In the alternative, he argues the trial court erred by declining to hold a Frye-Reed\n\nhearing and/or a Rule 5-702 hearing to assess the admissibility of Dr. Hall-Carrington’s\n\nIQ loss opinion. He relies, primarily, on City Homes, Inc. v. Hazelwood, 210 Md. App.\n\n615, cert. denied, 432 Md. 468 (2013). Ms. Stevenson takes the position that Roy v.\n\nDackman abrogated Hazelwood, and is dispositive on this issue.14\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           The Court of Appeals’s opinion in Roy was filed the day after Mr. Rochkind\nfiled his opening brief in this Court.\n\n\n                                            46\n\f       In Hazelwood, the trial court in a lead paint case ruled that the plaintiff’s medical\n\ncausation expert, Eric Sundel, M.D., a pediatrician, was qualified to testify that exposure\n\nto lead-based paint can cause a child to lose IQ points and that the plaintiff there had lost\n\nbetween seven and ten IQ points as a result of her exposure to deteriorating lead-based\n\npaint at the subject property. On appeal after a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, this Court\n\nreversed. We held that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to offer an expert opinion on\n\nmedical causation because he had no relevant experience treating children for lead\n\nexposure; had never before testified as an expert in a lead paint poisoning case; and had\n\nno experience evaluating brain impairment in children who have been exposed to lead.\n\nWe concluded that the court abused its discretion, under Rule 5-702(1), by allowing Dr.\n\nSundel to “testify as to [the plaintiff]’s IQ or the loss of IQ points resulting from lead\n\nexposure or any alleged ‘brain impairment.’” Id. at 686. We also found Dr. Sundel’s\n\ntestimony that the plaintiff had lost seven to ten IQ points due to lead paint exposure to\n\nbe “no more than speculation based on articles he read that correlated diminished IQ with\n\nlead exposure.” Id. at 689-90.\n\n       In Roy v. Dackman, one of the issues before the Court of Appeals was whether the\n\ncircuit court had abused its discretion by precluding a pediatrician—in fact, Dr. Sundel,\n\nthe same pediatrician as in Hazelwood—from testifying about medical causation, in\n\nparticular, loss of IQ points resulting from childhood exposure to lead. The Court held\n\nthat although Dr. Sundel might “not be the most qualified expert witness” on that subject,\n\nhe was “competent . . . to testify” about it. 445 Md. at 43. The Court noted that there\n\nwere “material differences” between the record in Hazelwood and the record in the case\n\n                                             47\n\fbefore it with respect to Dr. Sundel’s qualifications. Id. at 49. It characterized as “overly\n\ndemanding” this Court’s holding in Hazelwood that Dr. Sundel was not qualified because\n\nhe “lacked ‘specialized knowledge concerning childhood lead poisoning, and\n\nspecifically, the determination of the source of a child’s lead exposure and causation.’”\n\nId. The Court emphasized, moreover, that since Hazelwood, Dr. Sundel had “endeavored\n\nto be more specific and shore-up the supposed deficiencies in his qualifications,” by\n\nreviewing and keeping up to date on publications about lead paint poisoning in children;\n\nand he had relied on the Lanphear Study, which is a well-known, although controversial,\n\nepidemiological study concerning IQ loss and childhood lead poisoning. Id. at 50. The\n\nCourt concluded that the circuit court had abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Sundel’s\n\nmedical causation opinion:\n\n               Dr. Sundel’s academic and experiential qualifications include a three\n       year pediatric residency in New York, a two year pediatric fellowship at\n       Johns Hopkins University Hospital, and more than 20 years in practice.\n       With this experience and as a board-certified pediatrician, Dr. Sundel was\n       shown on this record to possess a sufficient background from which to\n       provide an opinion as to the injuries claimed to have been suffered by [the\n       plaintiff] as the result of alleged exposure to lead. Whether a jury will find\n       his testimony persuasive will depend, in large measure, on the effectiveness\n       of [defendants]’ cross-examination and a comparison/weighing by the jury\n       against [defendants]’ competing witness(es)’ testimony.\n\nId. at 52.\n\n       It is clear from Roy that a pediatrician need not have specialized knowledge in the\n\narea of IQ test administration and interpretation to render a medical causation opinion\n\nthat exposure to lead-based paint resulted in a loss of IQ points. It also is clear from Roy\n\nthat this dispute did not trigger the need for a Frye-Reed hearing. 445 Md. at 33 n.9\n\n\n                                             48\n\f(stating with respect to defense counsel’s argument that Dr. Sundel’s IQ loss opinion was\n\n“sheer speculation” that “[i]t is clear from the extensive medical/scientific research on the\n\neffects of lead paint exposure on children that expert opinions relating to this topic do not\n\ntrigger generally the need for a Frye/Reed hearing and analysis”).\n\n       Because, as Mr. Rochkind acknowledges, there is a scientific consensus that lead\n\npoisoning causes IQ loss, the only issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nallowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that Ms. Stevenson sustained a specific IQ loss of\n\nbetween five and six points. Dr. Hall-Carrington formed her opinion by extrapolating\n\nfrom epidemiological studies quantifying IQ loss resulting from lead exposure in the\n\ngeneral population to estimate the range of IQ loss in an individual. The court accepted\n\nthis methodology as sound. This was not an abuse of discretion. Dr. Hall-Carrington’s\n\nopinion that lead exposure was a substantial factor in causing the loss of a specific\n\nnumber of IQ points was not novel. See, e.g., N.B.S., Inc. v. Harvey, 121 Md. App. 334,\n\n337 (1998) (noting that the evidence at trial, viewed in a light most favorable to the\n\nplaintiffs, showed that they lost ten IQ points and five IQ points respectively as a result of\n\ntheir exposure to lead); Berg v. Byrd, 124 Md. App. 208, 212 (1998) (noting that the\n\nplaintiff’s expert opined that he lost between five to ten IQ points as a result of his\n\nexposure to lead).\n\n       On vigorous cross-examination, Dr. Hall-Carrington fully explained the basis for\n\nher calculation of the IQ loss. Although her reasons for using Ms. Stevenson’s peak\n\nblood level were vague, she explained that the range of IQ loss would not have differed\n\nhad she used Ms. Stevenson’s average level. Mr. Rochkind’s experts also opined to a\n\n                                             49\n\frange of IQ loss—albeit a smaller range—based upon Ms. Stevenson’s blood lead levels.\n\nUnlike Dr. Sundel’s vague and variable IQ loss opinion in Hazelwood, Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington’s IQ loss opinion was supported by an adequate factual basis.\n\n                                           III.\n\n                                   Mark Lieberman\n\n      Mr. Rochkind contends the trial court erred by permitting Mr. Lieberman, a\n\ncertified rehabilitation counselor, to opine that, but for Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive\n\ndeficits, she would have functioned in the marketplace as an “average high school\n\ngraduate.” He complains that Mr. Lieberman was not qualified to offer that opinion and\n\nhis methodology was unsound. Specifically, Mr. Rochkind argues that Mr. Lieberman\n\nassumed, improperly, that all the impairments identified in Dr. Kraft’s report were caused\n\nby lead exposure when Dr. Kraft did not make that determination.\n\n      Ms. Stevenson responds that Dr. Hall-Carrington’s testimony established that the\n\nneuropsychological deficits Dr. Kraft identified were caused by exposure to lead-based\n\npaint and that Mr. Lieberman properly relied upon that testimony as the basis for his\n\nvocational opinion.\n\n      Mr. Lieberman’s testimony concerned vocational marketability. He was asked to\n\nreview Ms. Stevenson’s file after the sudden death of Martin Klitzner, a vocational\n\ncounselor who had met with Ms. Stevenson in January of 2013. He reviewed all of Ms.\n\nStevenson’s records and Mr. Klitzner’s report and also met with Ms. Stevenson in the\n\ninterim between the First and Second Trials. He assessed Ms. Stevenson’s employment\n\n\n\n                                           50\n\fcapacity using the RAPEL method (Rehabilitation plan; Access to the labor market;\n\nPlaceability; Earning capacity; and Labor force participation).\n\n        Mr. Lieberman opined that Ms. Stevenson was functionally illiterate, had ADHD,\n\nand would require a high level of supervision and direction in the workplace. She had\n\nfailed the entrance examinations for Baltimore City Community College and had been\n\nadvised to take pre-remedial continuing education classes to try to improve her academic\n\nabilities.   Mr. Lieberman further opined that Ms. Stevenson’s low IQ, ADHD, and\n\nfunctional illiteracy all were deficits that would adversely affect her vocational\n\nplacement. As a result of these deficits, Ms. Stevenson only would be able to find\n\nemployment in “very low skill positions requiring limited independent decision making,\n\nlimited ability to read and remember information and require a high level of supervision.”\n\nThese are “unskilled manual labor” jobs that pay “at or near minimum wage.” He\n\ntestified that she would likely only be able to work part-time. In addition, in order to\n\nmaintain employment, she would require the services of a job coach for “a couple hours a\n\nweek.” According to Mr. Lieberman, a job coach typically charges about $38 an hour.\n\n        Mr. Lieberman opined that, but for her IQ loss of five to six points, Ms.\n\nStevenson’s vocational abilities would have been within the “average range.” He opined\n\nthat under the PEEDS-RAPEL method,15 vocational counselors focus on parental and\n\nfamily history in assessing the vocational prospects of the child. Ms. Stevenson’s mother\n\n\n        15\n         PEEDS is an acronym for: Parental/family occupations; Educational attainment;\nEvaluation results; Developmental stage; Synthesis.\n\n\n                                            51\n\f(Ms. Montgomery) had graduated from high school; had been employed as an EMT; had\n\nobtained her CDL license; had worked as a correctional officer; and was a certified\n\nphlebotomist. Ms. Stevenson’s father had earned his GED; had managed a Kentucky\n\nFried Chicken franchise; and had obtained his CDL license as well. Mr. Lieberman\n\nopined that he would expect Ms. Stevenson to perform as well or better vocationally than\n\nher parents, but, in light of her cognitive deficits, that was not possible. His ultimate\n\nopinion was that Ms. Stevenson would be limited to obtaining “basic jobs” earning the\n\nminimum wage (then $7.25/hour), for an annual salary of around $15,000.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Mr. Lieberman’s expert\n\ntestimony about Ms. Stevenson’s vocational prospects with and without her cognitive\n\ndeficits. Mr. Lieberman’s expertise was in the area of vocational rehabilitation. He was\n\nnot asked to opine, nor did he opine, about the etiology of Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive\n\nimpairment.   That issue was the subject of Dr. Hall-Carrington’s testimony.         Mr.\n\nLieberman’s opinions that with her cognitive deficits Ms. Stevenson would only be able\n\nto attain part-time, minimum wage employment and that, but for these deficits, she could\n\nhave achieved greater earnings typical of an average high-school graduate were\n\nadequately supported by facts in evidence and were not based on speculation or\n\nconjecture. See Lewin Realty III, Inc. v. Brooks, 138 Md. App. 244 (2001), abrogated on\n\nother grounds by Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md., Inc. v. Gasper, 418 Md. 594 (2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                           52\n\f                                           IV.\n\n                                        Dr. Conte\n\n       In a related contention, Mr. Rochkind argues that Dr. Conte’s opinion at the\n\nSecond Trial should have been excluded because it was premised upon Mr. Lieberman’s\n\nopinion, which was deficient. Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting Mr. Lieberman’s opinion testimony, it did not abuse its discretion in admitting\n\nDr. Conte’s opinion because it was based on Mr. Lieberman’s opinion testimony.\n\n                                            V.\n\n                                     Dr. Brookshire\n\n       On direct examination, Dr. Brookshire, who, as mentioned, was Mr. Rochkind’s\n\neconomics expert, testified that Ms. Stevenson had “not sustained any loss of earning\n\ncapacity or work-life expectancy due to claimed exposure to lead.” He then was asked\n\nabout his familiarity with “a series of studies by medical economists on the effect of lead\n\non lifetime earning capacity.” He identified three studies on that topic, one of which\n\nquantifies “loss of lifetime earnings related to micrograms per deciliter of blood lead\n\nexposure that an individual might have.” When he was asked to explain how he had used\n\nthose figures and “updated it using appropriate economic means for present value,” Ms.\n\nStevenson objected.\n\n       At the bench, Ms. Stevenson’s counsel argued that because Dr. Brookshire’s\n\nopinion was that Ms. Stevenson had not sustained any loss of earnings whatsoever due to\n\nher lead exposure, he could not have relied on the studies quantifying the loss of earnings\n\nbased on blood lead levels in formulating his opinion. Moreover, he had not disclosed\n\n                                            53\n\fany opinion based upon these studies before trial. Counsel for Mr. Rochkind proffered\n\nthat Dr. Brookshire would testify that, based upon her blood lead levels, Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nloss of earnings caused by lead exposure would not exceed $8,000.\n\n       The court agreed with Ms. Stevenson, ruling that because Dr. Brookshire had not\n\nrelied on the studies in question in formulating his expert opinion and because Dr. Conte\n\nalso had not relied on them, the data from the studies would not be helpful to the jury and\n\nwas not admissible under Rule 5-703(b).\n\n       Mr. Rochkind contends this ruling was an abuse of discretion. He maintains that\n\nthe studies were relevant to show that Dr. Brookshire’s “damages estimate was consistent\n\nwith the existing scientific literature” and, “[m]ore importantly, [they] w[ere] offered to\n\nrefute Dr. Conte’s opinion.” Ms. Stevenson responds that the court acted within its\n\ndiscretion to preclude Dr. Brookshire from giving an opinion at trial that was not\n\ndisclosed in discovery and was not consistent with his disclosed opinion that Ms.\n\nStevenson had not suffered any economic loss.\n\n       Rule 5-703, entitled “Bases of opinion testimony by experts,” states:\n\n       (a) In general. The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert\n       bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to\n       the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by\n       experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the\n       subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.\n\n       (b) Disclosure to jury. If determined to be trustworthy, necessary to\n       illuminate testimony, and unprivileged, facts or data reasonably relied upon\n       by an expert pursuant to section (a) may, in the discretion of the court, be\n       disclosed to the jury even if those facts and data are not admissible in\n       evidence. Upon request, the court shall instruct the jury to use those facts\n       and data only for the purpose of evaluating the validity and probative value\n       of the expert’s opinion or inference.\n\n                                            54\n\f        (c) Right to challenge expert. This Rule does not limit the right of an\n       opposing party to cross-examine an expert witness or to test the basis of the\n       expert’s opinion or inference.\n\n       The “facts or data” at issue were not “reasonably relied upon” by Dr. Brookshire\n\nin forming his expert opinion that Ms. Stevenson did not sustain any economic loss as a\n\nresult of her exposure to lead. While it may have been appropriate to cross-examine Dr.\n\nConte about these studies, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the\n\nunderlying calculations were not admissible in evidence by Mr. Rochkind through Dr.\n\nBrookshire.\n\n                                           VI.\n\n                              Collateral Source Evidence\n\n       During Mr. Lieberman’s testimony, Ms. Stevenson’s records from the DORS\n\nprogram were admitted into evidence. Certain of those records included boiler-plate\n\nlanguage stating that DORS clients who are eligible for SSI or SSDI benefits are\n\n“excluded from participation in cost of services,” meaning that the services they receive\n\nthrough DORS are free. As mentioned, Ms. Crowder, from DORS, testified that this\n\nwould include the cost of post-employment job-coaching to the extent a client qualifies\n\nfor that service.\n\n       Defense counsel sought to question Dr. Conte about the DORS records to\n\ndetermine whether, in reaching his economic loss opinion, he had considered the\n\npossibility of Ms. Stevenson’s receiving free job coaching through DORS. As discussed,\n\nDr. Conte had opined that Ms. Stevenson’s entire future earnings would be offset by the\n\n\n                                            55\n\fcost of a permanent job coach. The court heard argument and ruled that the collateral\n\nsource rule precluded any reference to the cost of DORS services.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind contends this was error. He argues that, even if the collateral source\n\ndoctrine applied, once Ms. Stevenson moved the DORS records into evidence without\n\nany restriction on their use, he was free to use them to cross-examine Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nwitnesses. Ms. Stevenson responds that the court properly limited cross-examination to\n\nprevent evidence about payment of services by an entity or individual other than the\n\nalleged tortfeasor.\n\n       Maryland adheres to the rule that “an injured person [may] recover in tort the full\n\namount of his provable damages regardless of the amount of compensation which the\n\nperson has received for his injuries from sources unrelated to the tortfeasor.” Motor\n\nVehicle Admin. v. Seidel Chevrolet, Inc., 326 Md. 237, 253 (1992). Free job coaching\n\nservices from DORS are collateral source payments that are not admissible to offset\n\ndamages.    Ms. Stevenson’s introduction into evidence of all the DORS documents,\n\nincluding those reflecting a policy not to charge clients for services if they are eligible for\n\nSSI or SSDI benefits, did not operate to waive the collateral source rule. The court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by precluding defense counsel from asking Dr. Conte if he had\n\nfactored this collateral source into his economic loss opinion.\n\n                                    CROSS-APPEAL\n\n                                      Attorneys’ Fees\n\n       The CPA “specifically prohibits any person from engaging in unfair and deceptive\n\nprocedures in the rental or offer for rental of consumer realty.” Golt v. Phillips, 308 Md.\n                                              56\n\f1, 8 (1986). It is an unfair or deceptive trade practice for a landlord to lease property that\n\nis not fit for habitation, including property that contains deteriorated lead-based paint.\n\nSee Butler v. S & S P’Ship, 435 Md. 635, 667-68 (2013). The deteriorated paint must be\n\npresent “at the inception of a lease for the hazard to qualify as a basis for a CPA\n\nviolation.” Id. at 668; see also Richwind Joint Venture 4 v. Brunson, 335 Md. 661, 685\n\n(1994) (“It is reasonable to assume that the General Assembly intended to limit\n\napplication of the CPA to material misstatements and omissions at the inception of the\n\nlease rather than during the full term of the lease.”).\n\n       The CPA authorizes an individual to bring a private cause of action “to recover for\n\ninjury or loss sustained by him as the result of a practice prohibited by this title.” CL §\n\n13-408(a). “Any person who brings an action to recover for injury or loss under [the\n\nCPA] and who is awarded damages may also seek, and the court may award, reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees.” CL § 13-408(b). As this language makes clear, the decision to award\n\nfees under the CPA is discretionary.\n\n       In this case, Ms. Stevenson’s complaint set forth claims for negligence and for\n\nunfair or deceptive trade practices under the CPA. In the First Trial, the jurors were\n\nasked whether they found “that [the Fairview Property] contained chipping, flaking, or\n\npeeling paint at the beginning of the tenancy?” They answered that question in the\n\naffirmative. Thus, the jurors found as a fact that Mr. Rochkind had committed an unfair\n\nor deceptive trade practice by renting the Fairview Property to Ms. Stevenson in a\n\ncondition that was not fit for habitation.\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\f       On December 10, 2014, following the Second Trial, Ms. Stevenson filed a petition\n\nfor prevailing party attorneys’ fees under CL section 13-408(b). She attached a copy of\n\nher retainer agreement with her attorneys, in which she promised to pay them a\n\ncontingency fee equal to forty percent of any sum recovered, plus expenses. She also\n\nattached a “Client Expense Itemization” listing expenses totaling $135,513.81. She asked\n\nthe court to award her the full contingency fee ($437,200) and all expenses, for a total of\n\n$572,713.81.\n\n       Alternatively, Ms. Stevenson asked the court to grant her an award of attorneys’\n\nfees using the lodestar approach. She attached a “Time Chart” detailing work performed\n\non her case by Scott Nevin, the lead attorney, and by Robert Leonard, an associate. She\n\ndid not include time billed by paralegals and law clerks. In an attached affidavit, Mr.\n\nNevin attested that when Ms. Stevenson retained him he had been licensed as an attorney\n\nin Maryland for nearly 30 years, half of which he had spent specializing in lead paint\n\npoisoning cases. Mr. Leonard had been licensed in Maryland for seven years. The time\n\nchart calculated hours in two time frames: the period from December 19, 2011, through\n\nMarch 17, 2014, and the period from March 17, 2014, through November of 2014. The\n\nchart reflected that Mr. Nevin worked on the case for 116.5 hours in the first period and\n\nan additional 62.75 hours thereafter; and that Mr. Leonard worked 221.25 hours in the\n\nfirst period and an additional 105.5 hours thereafter. Although the Mr. Nevin’s affidavit\n\ndid not explain why the hours were broken into these two periods, it is clear that the first\n\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fperiod covers all litigation in the First Trial and the second period covers all litigation in\n\nthe Second Trial.16\n\n       Ms. Stevenson also attached to her petition the “Laffey Matrix” for 2014-2015.\n\nThe Laffey Matrix, which is prepared by the Civil Division of the United States\n\nAttorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, suggests appropriate hourly rates for\n\nattorneys based upon years of experience. The Laffey Matrix for 2014-2015 suggested\n\nan hourly rate of $520 per hour for attorneys with more than twenty years’ experience\n\nand an hourly rate of $300 per hour for attorneys with between 4-7 years’ experience.\n\nMs. Stevenson argued, based on the Laffey Matrix, that a reasonable hourly rate for Mr.\n\nNevin was $700 per hour for the first period and $725 per hour for the second period; and\n\na reasonable hourly rate for Mr. Leonard was $400 per hour for the first period and $425\n\nper hour for the second period.       Using these rates, she asked the court to award her\n\n$260,381.25 in fees plus the $135,513.81 in expenses, for a total of $395,895.06.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind filed an opposition to the fee petition. As relevant here, he argued\n\nthat the fee-shifting provision of the CPA is not intended to apply to personal injury\n\nactions that are alternatively styled as unfair trade practice actions; that Ms. Stevenson is\n\nnot permitted to recover her contingency fee or expenses under the CPA; and that Ms.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n            The verdict in the First Trial was returned on March 18, 2014.\n\n\n                                              59\n\fStevenson failed to provide “sufficient information so that [the circuit court] might\n\nconduct the analysis it is required to conduct under Maryland law.” 17\n\n       On January 30, 2015, the court heard argument on the petition and, on March 18,\n\n2015, it entered an order denying it. The court set out the guidelines for awarding\n\nattorneys’ fees under the CPA. It explained that the first step is to engage in a lodestar\n\nanalysis by “‘multiplying “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation . . .\n\nby a reasonable hourly rate”’” to “‘arrive at a “useful starting point.”’” (Quoting Friolo v.\n\nFrankel, 403 Md. 443, 453-54 (2008) (“Friolo II”), in turn quoting Friolo v. Frankel, 373\n\nMd. 501, 523 (2003) (“Friolo I”)). The second step is to subtract “excessive, redundant,\n\nor otherwise unnecessary” hours or hours “not properly billed to one’s client.” Friolo II\n\nat 453-54. The second step involves consideration of the factors enumerated in Rule 1.5\n\nof the Maryland Lawyers’ Rules of Professional Conduct (“MLRPC”) governing fees\n\ncharged.18\n\n       The court found that, in light of the jury’s answer to the first question on the\n\nspecial verdict sheet at the First Trial, Ms. Stevenson was a prevailing party on her CPA\n\n\n       17\n         In his opposition and in his motion for new trial, Mr. Rochkind argued that the\nCPA claim should not have been submitted to the jury at the First Trial because Ms.\nMontgomery testified that the property was freshly painted at the inception of the\ntenancy. He does not advance that argument on appeal.\n       18\n          Those factors include “the time and labor required,” “the novelty and difficulty\nof the questions involved,” and the “likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the\nacceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment of the lawyer,”\nand “the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the\nservices.” Md. Rule 16-812, MLRPC 1.5.\n\n\n                                             60\n\fclaim. It also found that “[h]er claims of negligence and violation of the CPA, which\n\nyielded successful jury verdicts in both trials, arose from ‘a common core of facts’ and\n\n‘related legal theories.’” (Quoting Friolo I, at 524). In the court’s view, the “causes of\n\naction [negligence and the CPA violation] essentially were indivisible in the presentation\n\nof operative facts during the [F]irst [T]rial” and “there was no differentiation between the\n\ntwo causes of action in terms of proof and determination of damages” in the Second\n\nTrial.    The court also determined that only attorneys’ fees, not expenses or fees\n\nattributable to non-attorneys, may be awarded under the CPA.\n\n         Turning to whether a fee award was appropriate, the court found that the “Time\n\nChart” and the Nevin Affidavit were too vague for it to apply the lodestar method. The\n\nTime Chart did not “state the actual time or describe the tasks undertaken to investigate\n\n[Ms. Stevenson’s] claims, communicate with the client and witnesses, draft pleadings,\n\nreview other parties’ pleadings, prepare interrogatories, request document production,\n\nprepare for depositions, engage in motions practice, attend court hearings for particular\n\npurposes, or address alternative dispute resolution.”\n\n         The court also took issue with Ms. Stevenson’s use of the “Laffey Matrix,” noting\n\nthat it is “a mechanism for calculating reasonable attorney’s fees in Washington, D.C.,”\n\nnot in Baltimore. The court observed that the hourly rates listed in Appendix B to the\n\nLocal Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland are “more apt\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\fand comparable.”19       Finally, the court concluded that it could not assess the\n\nreasonableness of the fee request because the Nevin Affidavit did not address “whether\n\nand how he was prevented from taking on any new cases by the inconvenience of\n\nconducting the two trials in this case.”\n\n       For all these reasons, the court determined that Ms. Stevenson had not “provide[d]\n\nsufficient information to allow th[e] court to make the reasoned and well supported\n\nanalysis required” for an award of fees; nor did the docket entries provide “specific\n\ninformation as to what an appropriate fee might be.” The Nevin Affidavit and the Time\n\nChart “offer[ed] some information as to some of the enumerated factors” but failed “to\n\noffer sufficient detail to satisfy many of the remaining criteria.” Due to the lack of\n\ninformation, the court found itself unable to “inject some reasonableness into fees sought\n\nby [Ms. Stevenson’s] counsel.” It thus denied the petition for fees.\n\n       Within ten-days of the entry of that order, Ms. Stevenson moved for\n\nreconsideration. She argued that the court abused its discretion by denying the fee\n\npetition because it did not exercise any discretion in doing so. She emphasized that the\n\ncourt had discretion to assess the reasonableness of the hourly rates and to lower the rates\n\nrequested, such as by applying rates consistent with Appendix B. She maintained that\n\n\n       19\n         Section 3 of Appendix B sets forth “Guidelines Regarding Hourly Rates.” For\nthe period between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2014, the guideline rate for lawyers\nadmitted to the bar for between five to eight years was $165-250 per hour and for lawyers\nadmitted to the bar for 15 years or more was $275-400 per hour. Effective July 1, 2014,\nthe lower range was amended to between $165-300 per hour and a new guideline range\nwas added for lawyers admitted to the bar for 20 years or more of $300-475 per hour.\n\n\n                                            62\n\fMr. Leonard and Mr. Nevin were entitled to the hourly rate at the high end of the ranges\n\nprovided in Appendix B ($300 per hour for Mr. Leonard and $475 per hour for Mr.\n\nNevin). She maintained that the court failed to exercise its discretion when it did not even\n\ncalculate a lodestar figure and assess the reasonableness of the fees sought under that\n\nmethodology.\n\n         By order entered on June 8, 2015, the court denied the motion for reconsideration.\n\nIt noted that Ms. Stevenson did not take issue with the court’s legal analysis, but with the\n\napplication of the law to the facts. It reiterated that the Time Chart failed to distinguish\n\nbetween time spent on the CPA claim and time spent on the negligence claim.               It\n\nconcluded that, “[w]ithout evidence sufficiently detailing the time [Ms. Stevenson]’s\n\nattorneys spent on the entire case, let alone the CPA claim,” the court “would be\n\nengaging in speculation for the ‘number of hours reasonably expended’ portion of the\n\nreasonable fee analysis.” Thus, even if the court had been able to determine a reasonable\n\nhourly rate, it was unable, with the information furnished, to “engage in the case-specific,\n\ndetail-oriented, and thorough analysis required in order to grant an award of attorneys’\n\nfees.”\n\n         On appeal, Ms. Stevenson contends the circuit court abused its discretion by not\n\nawarding her any attorneys’ fees under the CPA. She maintains that the court failed to\n\nexercise any discretion to “determine a reasonable hourly rate based on [its] own\n\nknowledge and experience,” coupled with the Laffey Matrix and Appendix B. And,\n\nhaving found that the CPA claim and the negligence claim were “essentially . . .\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\findivisible,” the court abused its discretion by not awarding her attorneys’ fees for “all of\n\nthe time that counsel spent on the litigation.”\n\n       Mr. Rochkind responds that the court properly exercised its discretion to deny the\n\nfee petition because Ms. Stevenson failed to present adequate proof of the appropriate\n\nhourly rate and the number of hours reasonably expended on her CPA claim. With\n\nrespect to the hourly rate, he maintains that Ms. Stevenson had to “provide specific\n\nevidence, such as expert testimony or affidavits demonstrating that attorneys with similar\n\nqualifications have received in the past the same fees for similar work conducted in the\n\nsame jurisdiction.” This was especially so given that her counsel had not provided any\n\nexplanation for how they had arrived at the requested hourly rates, which far exceeded\n\nthe amounts shown on the Laffey Matrix.           With respect to the hours reasonably\n\nexpended, Mr. Rochkind asserts that the Time Chart was “entirely inadequate,” both\n\nbecause it lacked sufficient detail and because it failed to “segregate the time spent on the\n\nCPA claim from the time spent on other claims.” Alternatively, he argues that an award\n\nof fees is not appropriate in a case of this type because it is a personal injury action and\n\nbecause it is impossible to divine from the verdict in the First Trial whether the jury\n\nawarded damages for violation of the CPA or on the negligence claim.\n\n       In Richwind, 335 Md. at 687, the Court of Appeals expressed doubt that an award\n\nof attorneys’ fees under section 13-408(b) of the CPA would be appropriate in a case like\n\nthe one at bar:\n\n              The instant case is fundamentally a personal injury action. It is\n       questionable whether the legislature intended to abrogate the long-standing\n       rule that attorney fees are not recoverable in personal injury actions, and to\n\n                                             64\n\f       permit plaintiffs who recover tort damages for personal injuries also to\n       recover attorney fees in such actions by bringing them under the CPA.\n       Based on our holding that the CPA is not applicable, we need not reach the\n       issue of whether attorney’s fees could properly be awarded in a personal\n       injury tort action based on an additional count which alleges the tort was\n       also a violation of the CPA.\n\n       Like in Richwind, in this case, Ms. Stevenson prosecuted a quintessential personal\n\ninjury action, but alleged that “the tort was also a violation of the CPA.” We need not\n\ndecide whether an award of prevailing party fees ever would be appropriate in such an\n\naction, however, because we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndenying the petition in any event.\n\n       Putting aside that Ms. Stevenson requested an award of her total contingency fee\n\nand an award of expenses, both of which are plainly prohibited, she asked, in the\n\nalternative, for the court to use the lodestar method and apply hourly rates that were not\n\nsupported by any evidence. The beginning rate proposed for Mr. Nevin was $700 per\n\nhour, $180 per hour more than the rate in the Laffey Matrix and $225 per hour more than\n\nthe high end of the range in Appendix B for an attorney with his experience. The\n\nbeginning rate proposed for Mr. Leonard—$400 per hour—exceeded the Laffey Matrix\n\nrate and the high end of the Appendix B rate by $100 per hour. Ms. Stevenson did not\n\npresent any evidence to justify the use of the Laffey Matrix for a case tried in Baltimore\n\nCity or to justify an upward departure from those rates.             In her motion for\n\nreconsideration, she argued that the court should have applied Appendix B, but did not\n\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\foffer any explanation as to why her counsel were entitled to fees at the high end of the\n\napplicable ranges.20\n\n       And most significantly, Ms. Stevenson did not provide evidence from which the\n\ncourt could determine the number of attorney hours reasonably expended on Ms.\n\nStevenson’s CPA claim. The Time Chart lacks the detail to do so. For example, as\n\nmentioned, Ms. Stevenson originally sued four other defendants. The Time Chart does\n\nnot specify and segregate hours spent investigating the claims against those defendants.\n\nMs. Stevenson’s proof that there was deteriorated lead-based paint at the inception of her\n\ntenancy at the Fairview Property—all that was needed to establish the CPA violation—\n\nwas Ms. Montgomery’s and White’s testimony to that effect. Had the jurors found\n\nagainst her on that issue, it would not have been fatal to her remaining negligence claim,\n\nwhich was premised on Mr. Rochkind’s being on notice of the existence of deteriorated\n\nlead-based paint at any time during her tenancy. As Judge White found, however, Ms.\n\nStevenson made no attempt to separate out the hours spent developing and presenting\n\nevidence on the discrete CPA claim from the hours spent on the bulk of this personal\n\ninjury negligence action. Given the dearth of evidence that would allow the court to\n\nassess the reasonableness of the attorney hours spent in prosecuting the CPA claim, the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the fee petition.\n\n       20\n         Ms. Stevenson also did not explain why the hourly rates for Mr. Leonard and\nMr. Nevin during the period between December 2011 and June 2014 should not have\nbeen calculated under Appendix B to the then applicable Local Rules, which would have\nreduced the high end amount for Mr. Leonard from $300 to $250 and the high end\namount for Mr. Nevin from $475 to $400.\n\n\n                                             66\n\fJUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT\nFOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.\nCOSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY THE\nAPPELLANT/CROSS-APPELLEE     AND\nONE-HALF BY THE APPELLEE/CROSS-\nAPPELLANT.\n\n\n\n\n 67\n\f",

Arthur, J., did not participate in the\nCourt’s decision to report this opinion pursuant\nto Md. Rule 8-605.1.\n\f       In the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Starlena Stevenson sued S&S Partnership\n\n(“S&S”), Stanley Rochkind, and Dear Management & Construction Company (“Dear”)\n\nfor negligence and violations of the Consumer Protection Act (“CPA”), Md. Code (1975,\n\n2013 Repl. Vol.), section 13-301 et seq. of the Commercial Law Article (“CL”).1 As\n\nrelevant here, she alleged that she suffered injuries as a result of ingesting lead-based\n\npaint inside 3823 Fairview Avenue (“the Fairview Property”), which was owned by Mr.\n\nRochkind and S&S and was managed by Dear.\n\n       In March of 2014, the case was tried to a jury with Judge Steven Sfekas presiding\n\n(“the First Trial”). The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Stevenson, awarding her\n\n$829,000 in economic damages and $534,000 in non-economic damages. Mr. Rochkind\n\nmoved for a new trial or, in the alternative, a remittitur. Judge Sfekas granted the motion\n\nin part, ordering a partial new trial on damages.\n\n       The partial new trial was held before a jury in October and November of 2014,\n\nwith Judge Pamela White presiding (“the Second Trial”). The jury returned a verdict\n\nawarding Ms. Stevenson $753,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in non-economic\n\ndamages.    Mr. Rochkind filed a motion for new trial, which was denied, and Ms.\n\nStevenson filed a motion for attorneys’ fees, which also was denied. Applying the cap on\n\nnon-economic damages, see Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), section 11-108 of the\n\n\n\n       1\n         As we shall discuss, Ms. Stevenson also named four other defendants in her\ncomplaint. By the time of the trials in this matter, the only remaining active claims were\nagainst Mr. Rochkind, Dear, and S&S.\n\fCourts and Judicial Proceedings Article (“CJP”), Judge White reduced the judgment to\n\n$1,103,000.\n\n      Mr. Rochkind noted this appeal, presenting eleven questions for review, which we\n\nhave combined and rephrased as follows:\n\n      I. Did Judge Sfekas err by ordering a partial new trial, instead of a full new\n      trial, and did Judge White improperly narrow the issues to be re-tried?\n\n      II. In the First and the Second Trials, did the court err by declining to hold a\n      Frye-Reed hearing and by ruling that Cynthia Hall-Carrington, M.D., could\n      testify that the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing cause of\n      Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels, that Ms. Stevenson’s ADHD was\n      caused by that lead exposure, and that Ms. Stevenson lost a specific number\n      of IQ points as a result of that lead exposure?\n\n      III. In the Second Trial, did the circuit court err by not holding a Frye-Reed\n      hearing to assess the methodologies employed by Mark Lieberman, a\n      vocational counselor, and by permitting him to opine that, but for Ms.\n      Stevenson’s “cognitive defects,” she would have functioned as an “average\n      high school graduate”?\n\n      IV. In the Second Trial, did the court err by permitting Michael Conte,\n      Ph.D to offer economic loss opinions premised solely on Mr. Lieberman’s\n      testimony, which should have been excluded?\n\n      V. In the Second Trial, did the court err by precluding Mr. Rochkind’s\n      economics expert from testifying about research that quantifies the loss of\n      lifetime earnings caused by incremental increases in blood lead levels?\n\n      VI. In the Second Trial, did the court err by precluding defense counsel\n      from cross-examining Dr. Conte about two exhibits introduced into\n      evidence by Ms. Stevenson that showed that she may have been eligible for\n      free job coaching?[2]\n\n      2\n       Mr. Rochkind phrased his questions presented as follows:\n      A. The lower court erred in the first trial (“Stevenson 1”) when, after\n         determining post-trial that allowing Dr. Conte to testify was error, it\n         ordered only a partial new trial.\n\n                                                                             (Continued…)\n                                             2\n\f(…continued)\n     B. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Cynthia Hall-Carrington, to\n         opine that lead paint from 3823 Fairview Avenue was a substantial\n         contributing cause of Appellee’s elevated blood lead levels despite the\n         fact that Dr. Hall-Carrington (1) is a pediatrician with no experience in\n         lead risk assessment, (2) performed no investigation into other known\n         lead sources, (3) did not consider or rule out other potential lead\n         sources, including prior residences, concurrent visitation properties or\n         ambien[t ]sources, and (4) relied exclusively on records selectively\n         provided to her by Appellee’s counsel.\n     C. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that (i)\n         lead exposure can cause ADHD and (ii) lead paint from Appellant’s\n         property caused Appellee’s ADHD, despite the fact that the\n         overwhelming opinion of the relevant medical community is that\n         heredity is the primary cause of ADHD; that the medical community\n         does not know whether lead exposure caused or is even associated with\n         ADHD; that Appellee’s mother, brother and possibly father have all\n         been diagnosed with ADHD; and that Dr. Hall-Carrington never\n         examined Appellee or performed a differential diagnosis.\n     D. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that\n         Appellee’s alleged injuries were caused by lead exposure at Appellant’s\n         property, despite the fact that she based her opinion/diagnosis\n         exclusively on epidemiological studies of the general population (which\n         she admitted cannot be used to diagnose individuals); never examined\n         Appellee; never performed a differential diagnosis and failed to consider\n         or account for Appellee’s non-lead related problems.\n     E. The lower courts erred by allowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that\n         Appellee lost a specific number of IQ points as the result of alleged lead\n         exposure (from any and all sources) based on studies involving the\n         effect of lead exposure (from any and all sources) based on studies\n         involving the effect [o]f lead exposure on the general population despite\n         the fact that she has no experience in IQ testing, had no foundation for\n         rendering such an opinion, and two Maryland appellate courts have held\n         that rendering such an opinion is error.\n     F. The lower courts erred by rejecting Appellants’ request to hold an\n         evidentiary pretrial hearing on Appellee’s experts (Dr. Hall-Carrington\n         and Mark Lieberman) under Frye-Reed and/or Rule 5-702 to present\n         expert testimony concerning the foundation, reliability and methodology\n         employed by Appellee’s experts.\n\n                                                                           (Continued…)\n                                            3\n\f       Ms. Stevenson noted a cross-appeal, presenting one question: Did the circuit court\n\nerr by denying her request for attorneys’ fees?\n\n       For the following reasons, we shall affirm the judgments of the circuit court.\n\n                             FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n\n\n\n(…continued)\n     G. The first trial court erred when it granted a partial new trial on damages\n         only (rather than a complete new trial), despite the fact that the issues of\n         liability and damages were inextricably intertwined[.]\n     H. The trial court committed error when it allowed Appellee’s vocational\n         expert to opine that Appellee would have functioned as an “average\n         high school graduate” but for her “cognitive deficits,” despite the fact\n         that the expert had no qualifications or foundation for rendering such an\n         opinion and purported to arrive at his opinion based on a methodology\n         (the PEEDS-RAPEL Method) that does not purport to, and cannot be\n         used to, predict educational attainment.\n     I. The trial court committed error in excluding Appellant’s expert\n         economist from testifying about the generally accepted scientific\n         research (including the numbers used by the Centers for Disease\n         Control) that quantifies the loss of lifetime earnings caused by\n         incremental increases in blood lead levels to rebut the testimony of\n         Appellee’s expert economist and as support for his own opinions[.]\n     J. The trial court committed error when it allowed Appellee to introduce\n         into eviden[c]e two exhibits “for all purposes” which showed that the\n         Appellee was eligible for free job coaching, and then precluded\n         Appellant from using this same evidence to cross-examine Appellee’s\n         expert economist who based his loss of income calculations on the\n         assumption that the Appellee would never earn any future income\n         because she could not afford job coaching.\n     K. The trial court committed error when it allowed Appellee’s expert\n         economist to render economic loss opinions based solely on the\n         opinions of Appellee’s vocational expert, which themselves should have\n         been excluded.\n\n(Emphasis in original.)\n\n\n                                             4\n\f       Ms. Stevenson was born on December 22, 1990.               Her mother, Charlena\n\nMontgomery, was 17 years old at the time. Ms. Stevenson was raised by her mother and\n\nher maternal grandmother, Lorena Cooks. Her father, Vernon Stevenson, was largely\n\nabsent from her life. She has a maternal half-brother, who is 22, and a maternal half-\n\nsister, who is 16.\n\n       From birth until age nine months, Ms. Stevenson lived with Ms. Montgomery and\n\nMs. Cooks at 2110 Clifton Avenue, in Baltimore City (“2110 Clifton Property”).\n\nAccording to Ms. Montgomery, the interior walls of that property were covered with\n\nwood paneling, the windows were vinyl, and there was no chipping, peeling, or flaking\n\n(“deteriorated”) paint.\n\n       In October of 1991, Ms. Stevenson and Ms. Montgomery moved to the Fairview\n\nProperty, a West Baltimore rowhouse that was built in 1930. Ms. Montgomery recalled\n\nthat the interior of the property was repainted before they moved in. The painters simply\n\ncovered over the existing flaking and chipping paint, however, and the paint soon\n\ndeteriorated on the interior walls.     There also was deteriorated paint on the wood\n\nwindowsills, the ceilings, the heaters, and the front porch.\n\n       Ms. Stevenson lived at the Fairview Property for fifteen months. During that time,\n\nshe started walking. She liked to look out the window. Ms. Montgomery saw her\n\ntouching the windowsills and then her mouth, and licking the windows. Ms. Stevenson\n\nsometimes rested her food on the windowsill and ate while standing there.\n\n       For the first 13 months that she lived at the Fairview Property, Ms. Stevenson\n\nspent from 7 a.m. to 3 or 4 p.m., five days a week, at the house of a babysitter, while her\n\n                                              5\n\fmother attended high school. The babysitter’s house was located at 2114 Clifton Avenue\n\n(“2114 Clifton Property”), two doors down from the 2110 Clifton Property. The 2114\n\nClifton Property had been “gut rehabilitated” in 1985 and had new windows. There was\n\nno deteriorated paint at that property.\n\n       In January of 1993, soon after Ms. Stevenson turned two, she and Ms.\n\nMontgomery moved to what Ms. Montgomery called a “newer apartment,” on\n\nPennsylvania Avenue (“the Pennsylvania Avenue Property”).            According to Ms.\n\nMontgomery, there was no deteriorated paint at that property.\n\n       Ms. Stevenson’s blood was tested for lead four times, beginning when she was\n\nalmost two years old and was living at the Fairview Property, and ending when she was\n\nseven years old. The results were as follows:\n\n    Date                           Blood Lead Level         Ms. Stevenson’s\n                                                            Address\n    October 29, 1992               14 µg/dL                 Fairview Property\n\n    January 8, 1993                13 µg/dL                 Fairview Property\n\n    March 17, 1993                 11 µg/dL                 Pennsylvania    Avenue\n                                                            Property\n    September 3, 1998              8 µg/dL                  424    Oxford     Court,\n                                                            Baltimore City or\n                                                            1809 Raynor Avenue,\n                                                            Baltimore City3\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        In her first amended complaint, Ms. Stevenson alleged that she lived at the\nOxford Court address from 1996 to 1998 and at the Raynor Avenue address from 1998 to\n1999.\n\n\n                                              6\n\f      When Ms. Stevenson was five years old, Ms. Montgomery took her to the\n\nKennedy Krieger Institute (“KKI”) for an evaluation because she was struggling to pay\n\nattention in school and was “hyper.” Thomas Ley, Ph.D, a KKI psychologist, determined\n\nthat Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive functioning was within the “low average to borderline\n\nrange,” with a full scale IQ of 76 (+/- 5). He diagnosed her with Attention Deficit\n\nHyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”), for which he prescribed Adderal, and recommended\n\nfurther testing to rule out a developmental language disorder. Ms. Stevenson remained\n\non Adderal until she was 14.\n\n      Beginning in the third grade, Ms. Stevenson was placed in special education\n\nclasses. She was assigned a one-on-one aide who assisted her in school.\n\n      At age 13, Ms. Stevenson attempted suicide by cutting herself and overdosing on\n\nprescribed medication. The following year, in April of 2005, Ms. Montgomery took Ms.\n\nStevenson to the Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital (“MWPH”) for an evaluation.\n\nMs. Stevenson was complaining of auditory hallucinations and depression. In May of\n\n2005, a psychologist at MWPH tested Ms. Stevenson and determined that she had a full\n\nscale IQ of 65, which is in the “Extremely Low range of ability.” She was diagnosed\n\nwith major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n      Ms. Stevenson never was held back in school or suspended.           In 2008, she\n\ngraduated from high school.       She then enrolled in a Division of Occupational\n\nRehabilitation (“DORS”) program for job training and coaching. Through the DORS\n\n\n\n\n                                           7\n\fprogram, she found a job as a “transporter” for the University of Maryland Medical\n\nSystems. She was fired from that position, however.4\n\n       For about 10 months in 2012 and 2013, Ms. Stevenson was employed part-time at\n\na Royal Farms store, in the kitchen and at the cash register. She quit because she was\n\nbored. In 2014, she worked as a babysitter for her cousin’s children between the hours of\n\n7 p.m. and 7 a.m., earning approximately $200 every other week. At the times of the\n\ntrials in this matter, Ms. Stevenson was unemployed.\n\n       On December 19, 2011, Ms. Stevenson filed suit against Mr. Rochkind and the\n\nother defendants for negligence and unfair trade practices. The First Trial began on\n\nMarch 6, 2014. Ms. Stevenson testified and called three fact witnesses and nine expert\n\nwitnesses in her case. Ms. Stevenson’s and Ms. Montgomery’s testimony was as we\n\nhave recited the facts.\n\n       Christopher White, a certified lead risk assessor for Arc Environmental, Inc.\n\n(“Arc”), testified that, on July 13, 2012, Arc performed x-ray fluorescence (“XRF”)\n\ntesting on the interior and exterior surfaces of the Fairview Property. The XRF testing\n\nrevealed 22 interior painted surfaces and nine exterior painted surfaces that were positive\n\nfor the presence of lead-based paint. Inside the property, door jambs, window casings,\n\nbaseboards, and door casings all tested positive. Mr. White opined that, based upon the\n\nage of the house, and the fact that lead-based paint has been prohibited for use in\n\n       4\n        According to Ms. Stevenson, Ms. Montgomery “got [her] fired” after she showed\nup at work to check on her.\n\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\fresidential properties in Baltimore City since 1978, it was more likely than not that the\n\nlead-based paint had been present at the Fairview Property in 1991, when Ms. Stevenson\n\nand Ms. Montgomery moved in.\n\n      Robert Simon, Ph.D, an industrial hygienist, toxicologist, and lead risk assessor,\n\ntestified, based on his review of the records in this case, that neither the 2110 Clifton\n\nProperty, the 2114 Clifton Property, the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, nor other\n\nenvironmental lead were the source of Ms. Stevenson’s lead exposure. He explained that\n\nbecause the 2110 Clifton Property had wood paneling throughout the interior, with the\n\nexception of a bathroom, and had vinyl windows, any lead-based paint was “encased”\n\nand was not a source of lead exposure. Similarly, because the 2114 Clifton Property had\n\nbeen gut-rehabilitated in 1985, had cement steps, new carpet, and no deteriorated paint, it\n\nwas not a source of lead exposure. He had reviewed a 2010 Arc report that showed that\n\nXRF testing inside the vestibule area of the Pennsylvania Avenue Property was negative\n\nfor lead-based paint; and he knew that Ms. Montgomery had testified that the paint at the\n\nPennsylvania Avenue Property was not deteriorated.5 According to Dr. Simon, this\n\nevidence ruled out the Pennsylvania Avenue Property as a source of Ms. Stevenson’s lead\n\nexposure. In light of the age of the Fairview Property, the Arc testing of that property,\n\nand the observed presence of deteriorating paint at that property in the 1991-1993\n\n\n\n      5\n        Because Arc was not able to enter the apartments inside the Pennsylvania\nAvenue Property, no XRF testing was performed inside the apartment where Ms.\nStevenson had lived.\n\n\n                                            9\n\ftimeframe, Dr. Simon opined that there were lead-based paint hazards present at the\n\nFairview Property when Ms. Stevenson lived there.\n\n       Robert Kraft, Psy.D, a psychologist, performed a neuropsychological evaluation of\n\nMs. Stevenson on August 4, 2012. Her full scale IQ was 72, which is in the “borderline\n\nrange of general intelligence,” and her verbal IQ was 66, which is in the “extremely low\n\nrange.” Her verbal comprehension lagged far behind her perceptual reasoning skills, an\n\nindication of a language-based learning disability.        Her memory and executive\n\nfunctioning skills were normal, however, and her motor functioning was above average.\n\nDr. Kraft opined that Ms. Stevenson suffered from numerous cognitive deficits, including\n\nin general intelligence, attention, language function, visual motor functioning, and\n\nacademic achievement. He further opined that these deficits are permanent and are likely\n\nto negatively affect her ability to find employment, manage her personal finances, and\n\nmaintain social connections. (He offered no opinion about the cause of any of Ms.\n\nStevenson’s cognitive deficits.)\n\n       Cynthia Hall-Carrington, M.D., whose testimony we shall discuss in greater detail\n\nbelow, opined that the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing cause of Ms.\n\nStevenson’s elevated blood lead levels. Based upon Ms. Montgomery’s answers to\n\ninterrogatories and the Arc testing at the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, she ruled out the\n\n2114 Clifton Property, the 2110 Clifton Property, and the Pennsylvania Avenue Property\n\nas sources of Ms. Stevenson’s lead exposure. She testified that Ms. Stevenson was\n\ninjured as a result of her elevated blood lead levels, opining that she suffered “deficits\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fand loss of IQ, as well as ADHD and academic decrements also.” She estimated that Ms.\n\nStevenson had lost between 5 and 6 IQ points as a result of lead exposure.\n\n       Mark Lieberman, a certified rehabilitation counselor, testified about Ms.\n\nStevenson’s vocational marketability.       His ultimate opinion was that, although Ms.\n\nStevenson graduated from high school, she will not function in the job market as an\n\n“average high school graduate.” Rather, she only will be able to obtain “basic jobs,” for\n\nexample as a cashier or a lobby attendant, earning the minimum wage (then $7.25/hour),\n\nfor an annual salary of around $15,000.6 Jobs of this sort are likely to be part-time, 20-30\n\nhours per week. In Mr. Lieberman’s view, Ms. Stevenson will require job coaching on a\n\nweekly basis in order to maintain employment.\n\n       Dr. Conte, an economist, relied upon Mr. Lieberman’s expert vocational opinion\n\nto render an opinion about Ms. Stevenson’s potential future earnings and her loss of those\n\nearnings as a result of her cognitive impairments. He opined that, as an average high\n\nschool graduate, Ms. Stevenson could have earned $1,636,458 in wages and fringe\n\nbenefits over her lifetime. Her lifetime wages and fringe benefits as a minimum wage\n\nemployee would be $806,753. The difference between those two figures—$829,705—\n\nwas Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind testified that in 1984 he incorporated Dear and was its sole director.\n\nThe following year, he purchased S&S and became its general partner. At that time, the\n\n       6\n         In 2014, the General Assembly enacted legislation raising the minimum wage\nover a four year period. The minimum wage went up to $8.25 per hour in July 2015, and\nwill go up to $8.75 in July 2016, $9.25 in July 2017, and $10.10 in July 2018.\n\n\n                                             11\n\fFairview Property was an asset of the partnership. In 1991, Charles Runkles was hired as\n\nthe property manager for Dear. Dear was responsible for keeping the rental properties\n\nowned by S&S in compliance with the Baltimore City Housing Code lead-based paint\n\nprohibitions.\n\n       Mr. Runkles testified that Dear has no records about the Fairview Property from\n\nwhen Ms. Stevenson lived there. He was unable to recall whether Dear painted the\n\nproperty before Ms. Montgomery and Ms. Stevenson moved in and whether Dear\n\nreceived any complaints about the condition of the property while they lived there.\n\n       In his case, Mr. Rochkind called three expert witnesses: Neil Blumberg, M.D., a\n\nforensic psychiatrist; Cynthia Munro, Ph.D, a neuro-psychologist; and Joseph Sheller,\n\nM.D., a pediatric neurologist.\n\n       Dr. Blumberg reviewed Ms. Stevenson’s medical records, her deposition, and Ms.\n\nCooks’s deposition. He met with Ms. Stevenson for two hours in May of 2013. He\n\ndiagnosed her with “borderline intellectual functioning” and “major depressive\n\n[dis]order, single episode severe with psychotic features that is currently in full\n\nremission.” He opined that Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive impairment resulted from her\n\nhome environment, coupled with genetic predisposition, and that if her IQ were 4 to 6\n\npoints higher she still would fall within the borderline range of intellectual functioning.\n\nHe testified that Ms. Stevenson’s “relatively mild” exposure to lead was not a substantial\n\ncontributing factor to her cognitive impairment or to her depressive disorder.\n\n       Dr. Munro conducted a full-day neuropsychological evaluation of Ms. Stevenson,\n\non April 8, 2013, and interviewed Ms. Montgomery that day.             She measured Ms.\n\n                                            12\n\fStevenson’s full scale IQ to be 74, which is in the borderline range (between 70 and 79),\n\nand her verbal IQ to be 70. She testified that individuals within the borderline range of\n\nintelligence have not necessarily suffered any brain injury. The result of other tests she\n\nperformed were not consistent with Ms. Stevenson’s having suffered a brain injury.\n\n       Dr. Munro diagnosed Ms. Stevenson with borderline intellectual functioning and\n\nmajor depressive disorder, in partial remission. She opined that genetic factors played “a\n\nlarge role” in Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive impairment and that her evaluation of Ms.\n\nStevenson revealed no evidence that she had brain damage caused by a toxic exposure.\n\nDr. Munro did not diagnose Ms. Stevenson with ADHD or any attention deficit disorder.\n\nShe explained that, because Ms. Stevenson had depression, and because depression\n\naffects attention, she could not make an attention deficit diagnosis. Moreover, she was\n\nnot convinced that Ms. Stevenson ever should have been diagnosed with ADHD, given\n\nthat the initial diagnosis at KKI was based largely on a questionnaire completed by Ms.\n\nMontgomery and, at the time of her diagnosis, Ms. Stevenson was not getting adequate\n\nsleep, which could have caused her attention difficulties.\n\n       Dr. Sheller met with Ms. Stevenson and Ms. Montgomery a few months before the\n\nFirst Trial and reviewed Ms. Stevenson’s medical records. He diagnosed Ms. Stevenson\n\nwith borderline intellectual functioning. Based upon his review of scientific studies\n\nabout the neurological impact of blood lead levels similar to Ms. Stevenson’s, he opined\n\nthat she may have lost one to two IQ points as a result of her lead exposure. He testified\n\nthat a difference of between one and six IQ points will not have any apparent effect on\n\ncognitive functioning. He noted that Ms. Stevenson’s half-sister was evaluated at KKI\n\n                                            13\n\fwhen she was 5 years old and that KKI could not rule out ADHD. He opined that there is\n\n“a very powerful genetic link” for ADHD and, given that Ms. Stevenson’s mother, half-\n\nbrother, father, and possibly her half-sister also have attention difficulties, it is not\n\nsurprising that Ms. Stevenson has deficits in that area.     He further opined that the\n\nmajority of children outgrow ADHD symptoms in adulthood.\n\n      The case was sent to the jury on a special verdict that listed the following\n\nquestions:\n\n             1. Do you find that [the Fairview Property] contained chipping,\n      flaking, or peeling paint at the beginning of the tenancy?\n             2. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that there was flaking, chipping and/or peeling lead-based\n      paint at [the Fairview Property] during the relevant time period?\n             3. Do you find that Defendant, S&S Partnership acted negligently in\n      its ownership and/or management of [the Fairview Property] during the\n      relevant time period?\n             4. Do you find that Defendant, Dear . . . acted negligently in its\n      management of [the Fairview Property] during the relevant time period?\n             5. Do you find that Defendant, . . . [Mr.] Rochkind, acted negligently\n      in his ownership/operation of [the Fairview Property] during the relevant\n      time period?\n             6. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that she suffered injury as a result of lead exposure at [the\n      Fairview Property]?\n             7. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that she should be awarded non-economic damages?\n             8. What amount of damages, if any, do you award [Ms. Stevenson]\n      as damages for her non-economic losses?\n             9. Do you find that [Ms. Stevenson] has proven by a preponderance\n      of the evidence that she has suffered economic damages?\n             10. What amount of damages, if any, do you award [Ms. Stevenson]\n      as damages for economic damages?\n\n      On March 18, 2014, the jurors returned their verdict. They answered questions 1\n\nthrough 7 and question 9 in the affirmative. On question 8, they awarded Ms. Stevenson\n\n\n                                           14\n\f$539,000 in non-economic damages and, on question 10, they awarded her $829,000 in\n\neconomic damages.\n\n       Within ten days, Mr. Rochkind, S&S, and Dear moved to alter or amend or for a\n\nnew trial or remittitur. As relevant here, they argued that the court erred by permitting\n\nMr. Lieberman to express an opinion at trial that was not disclosed in discovery, and by\n\npermitting Dr. Conte to rely upon that new opinion to himself offer a new opinion. On\n\nApril 28, 2014, the court heard argument on the defendants’ motions.7 It ruled that Dr.\n\nConte’s trial testimony was a new opinion never disclosed in discovery and that its\n\nadmission had “unfair[ly] disadvantage[d]” the defense.8 On that basis, it granted a new\n\ntrial on economic damages. Because the jurors’ assessment of non-economic damages\n\nmay have been “skewed” due to their award of economic damages, the court also granted\n\nthe defendants a new trial on non-economic damages. The court ruled that the jurors’\n\nfindings with respect to liability would stand.\n\n       On the first day of the Second Trial, Judge White denied the defendants’ renewed\n\nmotions in limine pertaining to Mr. Lieberman and Drs. Hall-Carrington and Conte. In\n\nher case, Ms. Stevenson testified and called five witnesses from the First Trial: Dr. Kraft,\n\n\n       7\n         On April 25, 2014, Judge Sfekas held a hearing and granted a partial new trial.\nMs. Stevenson argued, pursuant to Rule 2-311(e), that because the court had not\npermitted her counsel to present any argument on the motions at that proceeding, it could\nnot grant a partial new trial. The court agreed that it had acted improperly and vacated its\nruling. It scheduled a new hearing on the motions for April 28, 2014.\n       8\n        The court did not find that Mr. Lieberman’s trial testimony included any new\nopinions not disclosed during discovery.\n\n\n                                             15\n\fMr. Lieberman, Dr. Hall-Carrington, Dr. Conte, and Ms. Montgomery. She also called\n\ntwo new lay witnesses: Alice Crowder, a DORS employee; and Jamie Weaver, Ms.\n\nStevenson’s supervisor at the Royal Farms store.\n\n       The testimony of Ms. Stevenson, Ms. Montgomery, Dr. Kraft, and Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington did not differ from their testimony in the First Trial.\n\n       Mr. Lieberman, who had met with Ms. Stevenson in the interim between the trials,\n\nopined, as he had at the first trial, that her cognitive deficits made her employable only in\n\n“very low skill positions requiring limited independent decision making, limited ability to\n\nread and remember information and require a high level of supervision.” These jobs\n\nwould be part-time, involve “unskilled manual labor,” and pay “at or near minimum\n\nwage.” Mr. Lieberman reiterated his opinion that Ms. Stevenson would require the\n\nservices of a job coach for “a couple hours a week” in order to maintain employment. He\n\ntestified that a job coach typically charges $38 per hour.\n\n       Dr. Conte offered a new economic loss opinion at the Second Trial. In making his\n\ncalculations, he assumed that Ms. Stevenson had a work-life expectancy of 32.5 years,\n\nthat she would be employable in minimum-wage jobs working approximately 25 to 30\n\nhours per week, and that she would require a job coach to maintain employment. He\n\ncompared her lifetime earnings in that scenario to the lifetime earnings of an “African-\n\nAmerican high school graduate.” Based upon those assumptions, he opined that, “absent\n\nthe deficits” described by Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Stevenson could have earned $1,595,114\n\nover her lifetime. In contrast, her potential lifetime earnings with her deficits would be a\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f“net” “negative earnings” once the cost of job coaching was factored in. Therefore, the\n\nvalue of her lost wages and benefits was the full $1,595,114.\n\n       Ms. Crowder is a technical specialist with DORS, who assists youths with\n\ndisabilities to transition into adulthood. She testified that she worked with Ms. Stevenson\n\nfor about three years, helping her to obtain training and employment. Ordinarily, once a\n\nDORS client finds a job and maintains employment for 90 days, the client’s case is\n\nclosed. A DORS client who has “difficulty on the job” may contact DORS and request\n\npost-employment services, which might include job coaching or other services to help the\n\nclient maintain employment. Ms. Crowder testified that Ms. Stevenson had been advised\n\nthat she was eligible for supplemental security income (“SSI”) benefits and that that\n\nmade her eligible for DORS services cost-free.\n\n       Ms. Weaver testified that she worked at the Royal Farms store in Morrell Park for\n\neight years and was the manager for three years, including when Ms. Stevenson worked\n\nthere in 2012. She characterized Ms. Stevenson’s job performance as “okay,” noting that\n\nshe “had to instruct her on what to do on a daily basis.” Ms. Stevenson’s attendance was\n\n“[f]air.” When Ms. Stevenson worked at the cash register, she “seemed confused, like\n\nshe was a new employee every day.” She had a “[g]reat attitude” but did not retain skills.\n\nShe could not be rehired at Royal Farms because the company has a “no rehire policy.”\n\n       In his case, Mr. Rochkind again called Drs. Blumberg, Munro, and Scheller and\n\nalso called two new witnesses: Michael Brookshire, Ph.D, an economist, and Robert\n\nTaylor, a rehabilitation counselor.\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f       Dr. Blumberg’s testimony was for the most part the same as his testimony in the\n\nFirst Trial. He modified his diagnosis of Ms. Stevenson slightly, based upon records he\n\nhad reviewed in the interim between the trials. He explained that he originally had\n\ndiagnosed Ms. Stevenson with a single episode of major depression that was now in full\n\nremission, but he now believed her major depressive disorder to be recurrent.\n\n       Drs. Munro and Scheller testified consistent with their testimony in the First Trial.\n\nDr. Munro elaborated on her view that Ms. Stevenson’s impaired cognitive functioning\n\nwas caused by her genetic predisposition, coupled with her chaotic home environment\n\nand depressive disorder, and not by lead exposure.\n\n       Mr. Taylor was accepted by the court as an expert in vocational rehabilitation\n\ncounseling. He testified, based upon Ms. Stevenson’s vocational history and Dr. Munro’s\n\nreport, that Ms. Stevenson is capable of working full-time in a number of jobs, including\n\nas a food service worker, housekeeper, childcare worker, and in certain clerical jobs. In\n\nhis view, she could earn more than the federal minimum wage in these jobs, estimating\n\nan income of between $18,000 and $21,000 a year. He opined that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\ninjuries linked to her exposure to lead had not resulted in any loss in earning capacity.\n\nRather, her “significant barriers” to employment arose from other “confounding\n\nvariables” in her life.\n\n       Dr. Brookshire testified that Ms. Stevenson had not “sustained any loss of earning\n\ncapacity or work-life expectancy due to claimed exposure to lead” and there were\n\n“significant other issues that would have affected her academic and vocational\n\noutcomes.” He opined that there was “no difference” between Ms. Stevenson’s “pre- and\n\n                                            18\n\f. . . post-injury earning capacity due to lead exposure” and the “total cost of additional\n\nrehabilitation services” required to assist her in finding full-time employment was in the\n\nrange of $3,453 to $6,036.\n\n       At the conclusion of all the evidence, the jurors were asked to find the amount, if\n\nany, of economic and non-economic damages Ms. Stevenson sustained as a result of her\n\nexposure to lead-based paint at the Fairview Property. On November 3, 2014, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict awarding Ms. Stevenson $753,000 in economic damages and $700,000\n\nin non-economic damages.\n\n       Within ten days, Mr. Rochkind, S&S, and Dear moved for new trial or, in the\n\nalternative, for a remittitur, and, on December 10, 2014, Ms. Stevenson filed a motion for\n\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n       On March 18, 2015, the court entered an order denying the motion for attorneys’\n\nfees. Within ten days, Ms. Stevenson moved for reconsideration of that order. On June\n\n8, 2015, the court denied that motion.\n\n       Meanwhile, on April 2, 2015, the court denied the motion for new trial. The court\n\nreduced the judgment in accordance with the cap on non-economic damages and entered\n\nan amended judgment in the amount of $1,103,000.\n\n       On April 29, 2015, Rochkind noted this timely appeal. S&S and Dear did not note\n\nappeals.9\n\n\n       9\n         In her original complaint and her first amended complaint, Ms. Stevenson\nalleged exposure to lead paint hazards and resulting injury at four other properties and\n\n                                                                           (Continued…)\n                                           19\n\f(…continued)\nsued the owners of those properties as well. She alleged that the Mayor & City Council\nof Baltimore City (“Mayor & City Council”) and Edgewood Management Corporation\n(“Edgewood”), owned and/or managed the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, where she\nlived for about a year after she moved out of the Fairview Property. She alleged that the\nHousing Authority of Baltimore City (“HABC”) owned two properties located at 1308\nHillman Street and 424 Oxford Court, where she lived from 1994 to 1996, and 1996 to\n1998, respectively. Finally, she alleged that Lawrence Polakoff owned a property located\nat 1809 Raynor Avenue, where she lived from 1998 until 1999.\n        On June 19, 2012, about a month after she filed her first amended complaint, Ms.\nStevenson filed a notice of “Partial Voluntary Dismissal Without Prejudice” as to her\nclaims against the Mayor & City Council and Edgewood, neither of which had been\nserved. On November 29, 2012, Mr. Polakoff was served by private process. On\nDecember 3, 2012, HABC was served and, on December 12, 2012, it filed an answer.\nTwo months later, on February 20, 2013, Ms. Stevenson and HABC filed a joint\n“Stipulation of Dismissal Without Prejudice” as to the claims against HABC. The record\ndoes not reflect that the claims against Mr. Polakoff ever were dismissed.\n        Ordinarily, a judgment that “adjudicates fewer than all of the claims in an action . .\n. or . . . less than an entire claim, or that adjudicates the rights and liabilities of fewer\nthan all the parties to the action” is not final and appealable. Md. Rule 2-602(a). In the\ninstant case, the claims against Mr. Polakoff remain outstanding and the judgment is not\nfinal.\n        Rule 2-602(b) permits a circuit court, in its discretion, to “direct . . . the entry of a\nfinal judgment . . . as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties” upon a\nfinding that there is “no just reason for delay.” Factors relevant to the exercise of that\ndiscretion include: “‘a harsh economic effect’ caused by delaying the right to appeal”;\n“the danger that the same issues will have to be considered by the appellate court on\nsuccessive appeals”; “the possibility that ‘the determination of the remaining [issues]\nbefore the trial court might utterly moot the need for the review now being sought’”; and\n“‘whether entertaining the present appeal upon the merits would require us to determine\nquestions that are still before the trial court.’” Doe v.

The factors\nweighing against the certification of a final judgment do not apply in this case and the\ncircuit court plainly would have had discretion to certify the judgment against Mr.\nRochkind, S&S, and Dear as final.

In a report prepared in June of 2013,\n\nhe calculated Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings to be $1,010,319. Following a pre-\n\ntrial evidentiary hearing on January 21, 2014, the court precluded Dr. Conte from\n\nexpressing that opinion at trial because it was based upon the Gibson & Gamboa work-\n\nlife expectancy tables, which the court found are not generally accepted in the economic\n\ncommunity. On January 22, 2014, Dr. Conte issued a new report opining that Ms.\n\nStevenson had sustained $556,413 in lost future earnings. He withdrew that report,\n\nhowever, and issued his final report on February 2, 2014. In it, he calculated Ms.\n\nStevenson’s lost future earnings to be $716,803. In doing so, he relied on the Millimet\n\nwork-life expectancy tables, which he applied by placing Ms. Stevenson in the category\n\nfor individuals having less than a high school degree.\n\n(…continued)\nthe First Trial or the Second Trial. He was not a party to any of the pre-trial proceedings.\nWe see no justification for further delaying the resolution of this appeal. Accordingly,\nwe shall direct the entry of a final judgment against Mr. Rochkind, S&S, and Dear\npursuant to Rule 8-602(e).\n\n\n                                             21\n\f       The defense moved to preclude Dr. Conte from expressing the opinion in his\n\nFebruary 2, 2014 report at trial. The court held a hearing on the motion at the outset of\n\nthe First Trial. It denied the motion, ruling that Dr. Conte’s use of the Millimet tables\n\nwas permissible, but directed that he place Ms. Stevenson in the category for high school\n\ngraduates in applying those tables.\n\n       At trial, Dr. Conte testified that he had relied on Mr. Lieberman’s expert\n\nvocational opinion in reaching his opinion about Ms. Stevenson’s potential future\n\nearnings and loss of future earnings. Mr. Lieberman had opined that even though Ms.\n\nStevenson graduated from high school, she would not be able to obtain the same jobs as\n\nan “average high school graduate” or command the same pay. Based on this opinion, Dr.\n\nConte testified, for the first time, that\n\n       had Ms. Stevenson not suffered from the cognitive deficits that she\n       currently displays, that she would be able to compete in the labor market\n       and command a salary of a typical high school graduate; but that because of\n       what she’s been through, she is most likely to be working in jobs that can\n       command only a minimum wage.\n\nDr. Conte calculated that, “absent her current deficits,” Ms. Stevenson could earn an\n\nannual salary of “$29,743 with relevant growth . . . which reflects the average salary of\n\nan African-American high school graduate in the U.S. economy” according to federal\n\ngovernment statistics. At a minimum wage job, however, Ms. Stevenson would earn just\n\n$15,080 annually.         He further calculated fringe benefits—including insurance,\n\nsupplemental pay, paid leave, retirement contributions, and mandatory contributions—at\n\n44.3% of salary. Based on these calculations, Dr. Conte opined that, as an “average high\n\nschool graduate,” Ms. Stevenson could have earned $1,636,459 in wages and fringe\n\n                                            22\n\fbenefits over her lifetime, but as an individual earning only the minimum wage she\n\nwould earn $806,753 over her lifetime. The difference between those two figures—\n\n$829,706—was Ms. Stevenson’s lost future earnings.\n\n       The court ruled that this opinion had not been disclosed to the defendants in\n\ndiscovery and amounted to an unfair surprise. It ordered a partial new trial, explaining as\n\nfollows with regard to the issues to be retried:\n\n       [T]he testimony in the case was that Ms. Stevenson had an elevated blood-\n       level, that she lived at [the Fairview Property] for that period of time, and I\n       think I’m not granting a new trial as to that issue. . . . .\n               There will be no need, in a new trial, for testimony by either ARC or\n       [Dr. Simon]. . . . .\n               [The plaintiff will not] need to establish (a) that there was lead in the\n       household; (b) that [Ms. Stevenson] was exposed to the lead in the\n       household; (c) that she had an elevated lead level; and, (d) that the lead\n       level that she had was, to a Substantial degree, the result of the exposure at\n       that house. I think the jury had conclusively decided that. I’m going to let\n       that portion stand.\n               Therefore, the only issue that will be available for retrial will be:\n       economic damages, non-economic damages and, of course, in both cases\n       that will depend upon some analysis of the degree of injury to which she\n       was subject. In other words, you know, the five to six point loss in IQ and\n       the vocational impact that that would have had. As I said, I think there\n       needs to be a proportional – some proportionate distribution of the damages\n       as well, ok?\n\n       At the outset of the Second Trial, Judge White advised the parties that she had\n\nreviewed the verdict sheet from the First Trial and the transcripts of the hearings on the\n\nmotion for new trial, and it was “absolutely apparent [to her] that the issues that [would\n\nbe] going forward to the jury [in the Second Trial were] questions numbered 8 and 10 on\n\nthe old verdict sheet.” Those questions asked the jurors to determine the amount, if any,\n\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fof economic and non-economic damages to be awarded. Judge White stated that “[t]he\n\ncausation issues were resolved by the first jury.”\n\n       Mr. Rochkind (joined by S&S and Dear) argued that Judge White’s reading of\n\nJudge Sfekas’s ruling on the motion for new trial was too narrow. He maintained that he\n\nshould be permitted to present evidence that Ms. Stevenson’s injuries could be the result\n\nof a “lot of things going on in [her] life,” not just lead exposure. He argued, moreover,\n\nthat he should be able to present evidence and argue to the jury that Ms. Stevenson was\n\nnot “damaged by this very modest level of lead exposure.”\n\n       Judge White stated that she did not anticipate limiting the defendants’ right to\n\ncross-examine Ms. Stevenson’s experts or to present their own expert testimony bearing\n\non “the nature of the injury and the severity of the injury.” She precluded Mr. Rochkind\n\nfrom relitigating the issue of “causation . . . as to whether it was the Defendants’ lead that\n\ncaused the injury; i.e., the lead exposure and elevated blood-lead levels.” Thus, the only\n\nissues at the Second Trial would be “quantification of damages with attention to nature of\n\ninjury, severity of the injury.”\n\n       On appeal, Mr. Rochkind contends Judge Sfekas abused his discretion by granting\n\nonly a partial new trial. He maintains that the issues of liability and damages were not\n\n“fairly severable,” and therefore the only effective remedy for Dr. Conte’s having\n\nexpressed an opinion not disclosed before trial, to the prejudice of the defense, was a new\n\ntrial on all issues. He further contends that Judge White erred by “limiting the scope of\n\nthe [Second Trial] to damages only, despite the fact that the issues of liability and\n\ndamages were inextricably intertwined.” He argues that he should have been permitted to\n\n                                             24\n\fintroduce evidence and argue at the Second Trial that Ms. Stevenson’s “damages were\n\ncaused by lead from other properties or ambient sources.” (Emphasis in original.)\n\n       Ms. Stevenson responds that Mr. Rochkind did not preserve this issue for review\n\nbecause he did not file a motion for reconsideration of Judge Sfekas’s or Judge White’s\n\nrulings. On the merits, she argues that the issue of damages was fairly severable from the\n\nliability issues, and therefore a new trial solely on damages was a proper remedy, and\n\nJudge White correctly limited the scope of the Second Trial to the “nature, extent, degree\n\nand quantification of the injuries.”\n\n       There is no merit in Ms. Stevenson’s preservation argument. Judge Sfekas’s order\n\ngranting a partial new trial was interlocutory and only could be challenged on appeal\n\nfrom the final judgment entered after the partial new trial. See Buck v. Cam’s Broadloom\n\nRugs, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062256\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062256/buck-v-cams-rugs/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 56 (1992).         Mr. Rochkind was not required to move for\n\nreconsideration of the denial of his motion for new trial on liability to preserve his\n\nchallenge to that adverse ruling. Nor was he required to move for reconsideration of\n\nJudge White’s ruling on the scope of the new trial to challenge that ruling on appeal.\n\n       Rule 2-533(c) permits a court to “set aside all or part of any judgment entered and\n\ngrant a new trial to all or any of the parties and on all of the issues, or some of the issues\n\nif the issues are fairly severable.” Mr. Rochkind relies on Stickley v. Chisholm, 136 Md.\n\nApp. 305 (2001), to support his argument that Judge Sfekas abused his discretion by\n\ngranting a partial new trial rather than a new trial on all issues because the issues of\n\nliability and damages were not “fairly severable.”\n\n\n\n                                             25\n\f       In Stickley, a jury in a medical malpractice case found that the defendant doctor\n\nhad breached the standard of care but his breach was not “the” proximate cause of the\n\nplaintiff’s injury. On appeal, we held that the trial court erred by instructing the jurors\n\nthat to find in favor of the plaintiff on proximate causation the doctor’s breach had to be\n\nthe sole cause of the plaintiff’s injury.    Invoking Rule 8-604(b), which permits an\n\nappellate court to reverse, in part, and affirm, in part, a judgment if it determines “that\n\nerror affects a severable part of the action,” the plaintiff sought to have the case remanded\n\nfor a partial new trial on causation and damages only. Id. at 316.\n\n       We declined to do so, concluding that for this Court to remand for a partial new\n\ntrial “‘it must clearly appear that the effect of the error did not extend to all the issues\n\ntried.’” Id. at 317 (quoting McBride v. Huckins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3550588\"><a href=\"/opinion/3570563/mcbride-v-huckins/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 531, 532 (N.H. 1911)). We\n\nobserved that the jurors may have compromised by finding in favor of the plaintiff on\n\nbreach of the standard of care and in favor of the doctor on causation; and that “the issues\n\nof negligence and proximate cause are . . . intricately intertwined[.]”      Id. at 317–18.\n\nBecause it was not clear “that the effect of the erroneous jury instruction was limited to\n\nthe issue of causation,” we remanded for a new trial on all issues. Id. at 317–318.\n\n       In the case at bar, the jurors in the First Trial found that Ms. Stevenson was\n\nexposed to deteriorated lead-based paint at the Fairview Property; the exposure was a\n\nsubstantial contributing factor causing her elevated blood lead levels; and Mr. Rochkind\n\n(and S&S and Dear) violated their duty of care by failing to maintain that property so\n\noccupants would not be exposed to deteriorated lead-based paint. Those findings and the\n\nevidence bearing on them were distinct from the medical issues pertaining to whether Ms.\n\n                                             26\n\fStevenson’s elevated blood lead levels resulted in a decrease in her IQ and in ADHD.\n\nPure damages evidence, such as Dr. Conte’s expert opinion about lost future earnings,\n\nwas even farther removed from the duty and source of lead evidence, and it was Ms.\n\nStevenson’s failure to timely disclose that damages opinion that was the sole ground on\n\nwhich the new trial motion was granted. Judge Sfekas did not abuse his discretion by\n\nruling that the damages issues were severable from the liability issues.\n\n       Finally, Judge White did not misinterpret Judge Sfekas’s ruling or abuse her\n\ndiscretion in limiting the scope of the Second Trial to the issues of economic and non-\n\neconomic damages. Mr. Rochkind was given wide latitude to present evidence bearing\n\non the nature and degree of Ms. Stevenson’s injuries and their causes, including expert\n\ntestimony of Drs. Blumberg, Munro, and Sheller that Ms. Stevenson’s impaired cognitive\n\nfunction and ADHD resulted from genetic predisposition, not from lead exposure. The\n\ncourt properly restricted Mr. Rochkind from arguing that Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood\n\nlead levels, and resulting injuries, were caused by lead exposure at other properties or\n\nfrom ambient lead.\n\n                                            II.\n\n                                  Dr. Hall-Carrington\n\n       Before the First Trial, Mr. Rochkind filed four motions in limine seeking to\n\npreclude Dr. Hall-Carrington from expressing at trial one source of lead causation\n\nopinion and three medical causation opinions. Specifically, he moved to preclude Dr.\n\nHall-Carrington from opining that the Fairview Property was a substantial contributing\n\nfactor in causing Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels and from opining that Ms.\n\n                                            27\n\fStevenson’s exposure to lead, as manifested by her elevated blood lead levels, caused\n\n“cognitive defects” and “behavioral problems,” the loss of a specific number of IQ\n\npoints, and ADHD.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind requested Frye-Reed hearings on each motion. Judge Sfekas denied\n\nthat request. On January 13, 2014, he heard argument on the motions in limine and\n\ndenied them. Before the Second Trial, Mr. Rochkind renewed his motions in limine.\n\nJudge White heard argument on the first day of the Second Trial and denied the motions\n\nas well.\n\nA. Expert Testimony Generally\n\n       Rule 5-702 provides that a court may admit expert testimony if the court\n\n       determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the\n       evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the\n       court “shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by\n       knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness\n       of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a\n       sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\n\n       The decision to admit or exclude expert testimony under Rule 5-702 is reviewed\n\nfor abuse of discretion.

In this way, Frye-Reed is “deliberately intended to\n\ninterpose a substantial obstacle to the unrestrained admission of evidence based upon new\n\nscientific principles.” Id. at 386 (citation omitted).\n\nB. Dr. Hall-Carrington’s Source of Lead Causation Opinion\n\n       Dr. Hall-Carrington is a practicing pediatrician who has been assessing children\n\nfor lead exposure for over twenty years. At both trials, she explained that the most\n\ncommon way in which young children are exposed to lead is by ingestion of lead-based\n\npaint chips, flakes, and dust.\n\n                                              29\n\f       Dr. Hall-Carrington opined that the Fairview Property was a substantial\n\ncontributing factor causing Ms. Stevenson’s elevated blood lead levels. In preparation\n\nfor trial, she reviewed Ms. Stevenson’s and Ms. Montgomery’s answers to interrogatories\n\nand deposition testimony; Dr. Simon’s report; a printout from the State Department of\n\nAssessments and Taxation for the Fairview Property; and the Arc report about the\n\nFairview Property.     She based her source of lead opinion on Ms. Montgomery’s\n\ntestimony that there was deteriorated paint at the Fairview Property and that Ms.\n\nStevenson had engaged in hand-to-mouth activities in the vicinity of the deteriorating\n\npaint at that property; the Arc report confirming the presence of lead-based paint in\n\nnumerous interior areas of that property; and Ms. Montgomery’s interrogatory answers,\n\nfrom which other possible sources of lead, including the 2114 Clifton Property, the 2110\n\nClifton Property, the Pennsylvania Avenue Property, and environmental sources of lead,\n\nsuch as fishing weights and glazed pottery, could be ruled out.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind contends that the court abused its discretion by allowing Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington to opine about the source of Ms. Stevenson’s lead exposure. He complains\n\nthat Dr. Hall-Carrington “is a pediatrician, not a lead risk assessor” and she did not\n\nperform any tests on the Fairview Property or “investigate other known, potential sources\n\nof lead exposure.” He relies upon Taylor v. Fishkind, supra, Ross v. Housing Authority,\n\nsupra, Hamilton v. Dackman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.

Dackman, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court in a lead paint\n\ncase did not abuse its discretion by precluding the plaintiff’s expert pediatrician from\n\noffering opinions at trial about the source of the lead the plaintiff was exposed to.10 In\n\nthat case, there was no direct evidence of the presence of lead paint inside the subject\n\nproperty and the expert’s source of lead opinion “was based solely on scant\n\ncircumstantial evidence, including the age of the home and exterior tests of the paint on\n\nthe dwelling.” Id. at 47. The Court observed that “it is not enough for an expert to\n\nconclude that a certain property is the source of the child’s exposure to lead when other\n\nprobable sources have not been eliminated”; and the expert’s proffered testimony did not\n\n      10\n         As we shall discuss below, the Court also addressed whether the trial court\nabused its discretion by precluding the same expert from testifying about medical\ncausation.\n\n\n                                           31\n\frule out other probable sources. Id. at 47-48. The Court held that in the absence of direct\n\nevidence of the presence of lead-based paint in the subject property and of evidence\n\nruling out other probable lead sources, the expert “was not competent to testify as to the\n\nsource of [the plaintiff’s] exposure.” Id. at 47.\n\n       The Roy Court explained that its holding regarding the expert’s competency to\n\ntestify about source of lead was in keeping with its decision in Ross v. Housing Authority,\n\nsupra, in which it upheld the trial court’s ruling precluding the plaintiff’s pediatrician\n\nexpert from giving a source of lead opinion when there was no direct evidence of lead-\n\nbased paint inside the subject property except on one stair riser; the only evidence of such\n\npaint on windows was for exterior windows and the expert was basing her opinion that\n\nlead-based paint was present at the subject property on the age of the house.\n\n       Roy, Ross, and the other cases Mr. Rochkind relies upon to argue that Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington should have been precluded from giving a source of lead opinion are\n\ndistinguishable. Here, there was direct evidence of the presence of lead-based paint\n\nthroughout the interior of the Fairview Property. Arc testing in 2012 revealed 22 interior\n\nsurfaces with lead-based paint. Dr. Hall-Carrington based her lead source causation\n\nopinion on the direct evidence of the presence of lead-based paint in the Fairview\n\nProperty; Dr. Simon’s opinion that because lead-based paint has been illegal to use in\n\nBaltimore City residences since 1978, the lead-based paint detected in the Fairview\n\nProperty in 2012 would have been present when Ms. Stevenson was living there, and that\n\nthe 2110 Clifton Property, the 2114 Clifton Property, and the Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nProperty were not sources of lead paint exposure; Ms. Montgomery’s testimony that the\n\n                                              32\n\fpaint inside the Fairview Property was deteriorated when she and Ms. Stevenson were\n\nliving there, and that she saw Ms. Stevenson put paint in her mouth; Ms. Montgomery’s\n\ndeposition testimony from which other environmental sources of lead, such as soil,\n\nleaded glazed pottery, and fishing weights, could be ruled out; and her own knowledge\n\nand expertise as a pediatrician with experience evaluating and treating children with lead\n\npoisoning. Compare with Taylor, 207 Md. App. at 141–42 (court’s ruling precluding\n\nopinion testimony by plaintiff’s lead source expert upheld when there was no direct\n\nevidence of lead-based paint inside the property, evidence only of such paint on one\n\nexterior window, and expert’s opinion was “pure speculation”); Hamilton, 213 Md. App.\n\nat 589 (court’s ruling precluding plaintiff’s lead source expert opinion upheld when there\n\nwas no direct evidence of lead-based paint in the property, there was only a positive\n\nfinding of lead paint on an exterior transom, and the expert was assuming that lead paint\n\nwas present due to the age of the property).\n\n       Dr. Hall-Carrington’s expert opinion about source of lead was not a\n\n“transform[ation of] thin evidence or assumptions into viable causal connections.”\n\nHamilton, 213 Md. App. at 608. Her opinion was grounded in fact, and the trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by admitting it.\n\nC. Dr. Hall-Carrington’s Medical Causation Opinions\n\n       In preparation for the First and Second Trials, Dr. Hall-Carrington reviewed Ms.\n\nStevenson’s medical and school records, Dr. Kraft’s report, and the deposition testimony\n\nnoted above. She did not examine Ms. Stevenson or meet with her. She explained that\n\n\n\n                                               33\n\fthat was not necessary because adults who have been exposed to lead as children\n\ntypically do not exhibit symptoms in a clinical examination.\n\n       In her testimony in both trials, Dr. Hall-Carrington detailed the ways in which lead\n\naffects brain development in young children. She recounted that scientific studies have\n\nconfirmed that there is a causal relationship between blood lead levels in excess of 10\n\nµg/dL in children and cognitive impairments and “externalizing behaviors.” She opined\n\nthat Ms. Stevenson sustained “brain impairment” from her exposure to lead; that “the\n\nextent of her injuries [had] affected her cognitive development, as well as her academic\n\nlevel of achievement”; and that she did not have other risk factors for cognitive\n\nimpairment, such as premature birth or head injury.          She further opined that Ms.\n\nStevenson’s “cognitive defects, . . . her academic achievement, and learning disabilities,”\n\nas well as her ADHD, were “caused” by her exposure to lead. She explained that anxiety\n\nand depression also “can be associated with exposure to lead” and that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nanxiety about school could have been caused by her poor academic performance and\n\ninability to focus. As noted, Dr. Hall-Carrington quantified Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive\n\nimpairment, opining that she lost between five and six IQ points as a result of lead\n\npoisoning. A factual “basis” for her medical causation opinion was the evidence that Ms.\n\nStevenson had ingested deteriorated lead-based paint at a “vulnerable age” when\n\nchildren’s brains are “more susceptible to the effects of lead.”\n\n       1) ADHD Opinion\n\n       In his motion in limine seeking to exclude Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion that Ms.\n\nStevenson’s exposure to lead-based paint caused her ADHD, Mr. Rochkind argued that\n\n                                             34\n\fthere is no consensus in the scientific community about the etiology of ADHD, much less\n\nthat exposure to lead in early childhood causes ADHD. Rather, the consensus is that\n\ngenetics plays a major role in ADHD. In support, he cited CDC reports, information on\n\nthe website of the National Resource Center on ADHD, a National Institute of Mental\n\nHealth (“NIMH”) report, and an article in the Journal of Clinical Psychology, all of\n\nwhich conclude that ADHD is a condition that runs in families.           In addition, he\n\nreferenced a 2008 article published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (“AAP”),\n\nwhich concludes that 80% of the etiology of ADHD is genetic, and described it as a\n\n“highly heritable disorder.”   He also cited a decision by a federal district court in\n\nOklahoma excluding an expert witness opinion that lead exposure causes ADHD.

Okla. 2007).11\n\n      In her opposition to the motion in limine, Ms. Stevenson argued that there is a\n\nconsensus in the scientific community that exposure to lead at or above certain levels\n\n“causes brain injury and other behavioral changes.” In support, she relied upon a 2013\n\npublication by the Environmental Protection Agency entitled “Integrated Science\n\n      11\n          In Palmer, the plaintiffs, seven children exposed to low levels of lead from\nmining waste at a superfund site, designated a psychologist to testify that lead exposure\nhad caused one of them to suffer from ADHD. (The others were not diagnosed with\nADHD.) The district court held a Daubert hearing and excluded the psychologist’s\nopinion. The court emphasized that the psychologist had not identified or referenced\n“any scientific literature showing that lead exposure can cause ADHD” and had cited a\n2002 CDC study finding “no compelling evidence that an [elevated blood lead level]\nincreases a child’s risk for [ADHD].” 510 F Supp. at 531 (alteration in original). The\ncourt noted, moreover, that the psychologist did not “state with any certainty how closely\nlead exposure and ADHD were related.” Id. Because the psychologist did not reference\nany scientific support for her opinion, the court ruled it inadmissible.\n\n\n                                           35\n\fAssessment for Lead” (“EPA-ISA”). The publication is the product of a team of scientists\n\nand technical experts and consists of analyses, based on peer reviewed medical\n\npublications and scientific studies, of the health effects of lead exposure. “The ISA\n\nprovides a concise review, synthesis, and evaluation of the most policy-relevant science\n\nto serve as a scientific foundation for the review of the National Ambient Air Quality\n\nStandards (NAAQS).” EPA-ISA at xliv. “The fundamental process for developing an\n\nISA includes . . . literature searches; . . . study selection; . . . evaluation and integration of\n\nthe evidence; and . . . development of scientific conclusions and causal judgments.” Id.\n\n       The EPA-ISA classifies numerous health conditions associated with lead exposure\n\ninto five categories: “Causal relationship,” “Likely to be a causal relationship,”\n\n“Suggestive of a causal relationship,” “Inadequate to infer a causal relationship,” and\n\n“Not likely to be a causal relationship.” Id. at lxii. In Table ES-1, the publication\n\nprovides a “[s]ummary of causal determinations for the relationship between exposure to\n\nPb and health effects.” Id. at lxxxiii. It concludes that in children there is a “[c]ausal\n\nrelationship” between exposure to certain levels of lead and the “Externalizing\n\nBehaviors” of “Attention, Impulsivity and Hyperactivity.” Id. At Section 4.3.15.2, the\n\npublication expounds upon that finding:\n\n       Attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity are evaluated together because\n       they are included within the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder domain\n       of externalizing behaviors (as reviewed in Whitcomb and Merrell, 2012).\n       Although examined less extensively than cognitive function, a causal\n       relationship between Pb exposure and attention decrements, impulsivity,\n       and hyperactivity in children is supported by multiple lines of evidence: 1)\n       findings from prospective studies in diverse populations for associations\n       with blood or tooth Pb levels; 2) coherence with evidence in animals with\n\n\n                                               36\n\f       relevant Pb exposures and; 3) evidence for plausible modes of action.\n       (Table 4-17).\n\nId. at 4-289 (emphasis in original).\n\n       Table 4-17, which appears at pages 4-311 through 4-323 of the EPA-ISA, details,\n\nin pertinent part, the associations found “from multiple, high quality epidemiologic\n\nstudies with relevant Pb levels,” identifying the studies by author, publication, and date,\n\ndescribing the supporting evidence, and specifying the “Pb Biomarker Levels Associated\n\nWith Effects.” Id. at 4-314. Those levels include in children “with age 30 months > 10\n\nµg/dL” of blood lead. The “modes of action,” meaning the ways in which lead exposure\n\nbrings about the detrimental externalizing behaviors are the same modes by which lead\n\nexposure brings about cognitive function decrements: impaired neuron development;\n\ndecrease in development of synapses; and changes in neurotransmitters.\n\n       The table sets forth the conclusions that there is a “Causal” relationship between\n\n“cognitive function decrements in children” and exposure to lead at low levels (in the\n\nrange of Ms. Stevenson’s blood lead levels); a “Causal” relationship between exposure to\n\nlead at low levels and “Externalizing Behaviors: Attention, Impulsivity, and\n\nHyperactivity in Children”; and a “Likely Causal” relationship between “Internalizing\n\nBehaviors in Children,” such as anxiety and depression, and exposure to low levels of\n\nlead. Id. at 4-311, 4-314, & 4-317.\n\n       Ms. Stevenson also cited in her opposition a 2005 “Policy Statement” about lead\n\nexposure in children by the AAP’s Committee on Environment Health. In a section of\n\nthe Policy Statement entitled “Toxicity of Lead,” the committee states that studies show\n\n\n                                            37\n\fthat exposure to lead causes IQ decrements in children and affects “other aspects of brain\n\nor nerve function, especially behavior.” Specifically, children with “elevated tooth lead\n\nconcentrations were more inattentive, hyperactive, disorganized, and less able to follow\n\ndirections”; and elevated “bone lead concentrations” has been associated with “increased\n\nattentional dysfunction.”\n\n       Ms. Stevenson maintained that she did not have to prove that her elevated blood\n\nlead levels were the only cause of her ADHD; she only had to prove substantial factor\n\ncausation. Moreover, she was not “required to rule out every other potential source or\n\ncause of ADHD or brain injury.” It was sufficient for Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that\n\nMs. Stevenson’s lead exposure “contributed to her ADHD.” Finally, Ms. Stevenson\n\nargued that her injuries, including ADHD, are “indivisible as a matter of law.” She\n\npointed to Dr. Hall-Carrington’s testimony in deposition that it is impossible to quantify\n\nhow much of her learning difficulties are due to lead exposure and how much are due to\n\nsocial factors.\n\n       As noted, the court denied the motions in limine. At trial, Dr. Hall-Carrington\n\nrelied upon the studies Ms. Stevenson cited in opposition to the motions and a study\n\nauthored by Bruce Lanphear (“the Lanphear Study”) to support her ADHD (and IQ)\n\nopinions.12\n\n\n\n       12\n          See Bruce Lanphear, et al, Low-Level Environmental Lead Exposure and\nChildren’s Intellectual Function: An International Pooled Analysis, 113 Envtl. Health\nPerspectives 894 (July 2005).\n\n\n                                           38\n\f       Before this Court, Mr. Rochkind offers three arguments as to why the court abused\n\nits discretion in admitting Dr. Hall-Carrington’s ADHD causation opinion. First, relying\n\nupon Blackwell, supra, he maintains that the trial court was required to hold a Frye-Reed\n\nhearing before ruling on the admissibility of Dr. Hall-Carrington’s ADHD causation\n\nopinion; and that the outcome of a Frye-Reed hearing should have been to preclude\n\nadmission of that opinion. Second, and relatedly, Mr. Rochkind asserts that Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington’s opinion as expressed at trial did not meet the threshold to prove general\n\nmedical causation, i.e., that low level lead exposure can cause ADHD. Finally, he\n\nmaintains that Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion was further deficient in that it failed to\n\nestablish specific medical causation, i.e., that her exposure in fact caused her to develop\n\nADHD. We do not find merit in any of these arguments.\n\n       In Blackwell, the plaintiff proposed to call Mark Geier, M.D., to opine that\n\nthimerosal, a preservative containing ethyl-mercury that is used in certain childhood\n\nvaccines, can cause autism in a “subset” of neurologically vulnerable children. 408 Md.\n\nat 611. The trial court held a Frye-Reed hearing. The defendant presented the findings of\n\nthe National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine’s (“IOM”) Committee reports\n\nfrom 2001 and 2004, the first of which concluded there is no evidence to support a link\n\nbetween thimerosal in vaccines and autism and the second of which concluded that the\n\nevidence favored “rejection of a causal relationship.” Id. at 599. These findings were\n\nbased on large scale epidemiological studies.\n\n       Dr. Geier was prepared to opine at trial, contrary to the IOM Committee reports,\n\nthat a causal relationship exists between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. The\n\n                                            39\n\fonly basis for his opinion was his own “epidemiological analysis” of publically available\n\nvaccine data, and the only published epidemiological studies purporting to show such a\n\ncausal link had been undertaken by Dr. Geier and his son. Id. at 600. Those studies had\n\nbeen strongly criticized in the scientific community and were not generally accepted or\n\nreliable. Moreover, the scientific consensus was that autism is genetic in etiology except\n\nin rare instances and that thimerosal in vaccines does not cause autism. Id. On that basis,\n\nthe trial court ruled at the conclusion of the Frye-Reed hearing that Dr. Geier’s causation\n\ntestimony was not admissible.      Without Dr. Geier’s expert opinion testimony, the\n\nplaintiffs could not establish a prima facie case, and the case was decided in favor of the\n\ndefendant as a matter of law.\n\n      The case reached the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. It explained that although\n\nDr. Geier’s “underlying data and methods for gathering this data [were] generally\n\naccepted in the scientific community,” he had “applied [that data] to support a novel\n\ntheory.” Id. at 596. Even if the underlying methodology was generally accepted, that did\n\nnot “mandate acceptance of conclusions ostensibly developed therefrom.” Id. at 589.\n\nThe Court gave as an example Wilson v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365169\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365169/wilson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">370</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), in which it had held\n\nthat an expert witness for the State in a criminal prosecution should not have been\n\npermitted to opine that the statistical probability of two babies in the same family dying\n\nfrom SIDS with cerebral swelling was 1 in 4 million. The opinion had been offered to\n\nsupport the State’s theory that the death of the second baby was not caused by SIDS, but\n\nby shaken baby syndrome, i.e., that the defendant had shaken the baby to death. The 1 in\n\n4 million figure was arrived at by squaring the statistical rate of one baby dying from\n\n                                            40\n\fSIDS with cerebral swelling. The Court explained that there was a lively debate in the\n\nscientific community about the role of genetics in SIDS deaths and there was no scientific\n\nconsensus that there was not a genetic component to SIDS. Thus, although the statistical\n\nanalysis was based on sound methods, the conclusions drawn were not sufficiently\n\nreliable to satisfy the Frye-Reed general acceptance test.\n\n       The Blackwell Court noted that several federal courts have been called upon “to\n\nscrutinize the reliability of the analytical framework utilized by an expert in formulating\n\na novel theory of science.” 408 Md. at 605 (emphasis in original). In General Electric\n\nCompany v. Joiner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118157\"><a href=\"/opinion/118157/general-electric-co-v-joiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997), the district court precluded the plaintiff’s expert\n\nwitness from opining that the plaintiff’s small cell lung cancer was caused by PCBs and\n\nPCB derivatives.    The Eleventh Circuit reversed, reasoning that experts may draw\n\n“different conclusions from the research,” and when they do, the issue is one for the jury\n\nto decide. Id. at 141. The Supreme Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari and\n\nreversed. Emphasizing that “conclusions and methodology are not entirely distinct from\n\none another[,]” the Court held that a trial court need not “admit opinion evidence that is\n\nconnected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert. A court may conclude that\n\nthere is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.”\n\nId. at 146. Such was the case with Dr. Geier’s opinion in Blackwell that thimerosal is\n\ncausally connected to autism.\n\n       The only similarity between Blackwell and the case at bar is that neither one\n\nconcerned the general reliability of a scientific method which is the usual circumstance\n\ncalling for a Frye-Reed hearing. Otherwise, the cases are entirely distinct, and the\n\n                                             41\n\fholding in Blackwell does not support the conclusion that the trial court in this case\n\nabused its discretion by not holding a Frye-Reed hearing.          Dr. Geier’s scientific\n\nconclusion, from his own epidemiologic studies, that the thimerisol in certain vaccines\n\ncauses autism had been universally rejected in the scientific community and, indeed, had\n\nbeen disproven through numerous other epidemiologic studies. To this day, scientists are\n\nsearching for the cause or causes of autism.\n\n       By contrast, for decades, beginning in the 1970s, it has been widely accepted that\n\nlead exposure at levels insufficient to produce acute illness nevertheless causes\n\ndeleterious health effects, especially cognitive deficits in children. Unlike in an autism\n\ncase like Blackwell, where the fundamental issue is whether there is any causal\n\nconnection between thimerisol exposure and autism, in lead paint cases such as this there\n\nis no controversy over the basic question whether lead paint exposure can cause health\n\ndeficits in children. Rather, the causation disputes concern which health deficits in\n\nchildren are caused by lead exposure and the level of exposure that will produce them.\n\n       As we have explained, Ms. Stevenson’s opposition to the motion in limine showed\n\nthat Dr. Hall-Carrington’s ADHD causation opinion was based on epidemiologic studies,\n\nmany of which were compiled and analyzed in the EPA-ISA and supported its finding of\n\na causal link between low-level lead exposure in children and the constellation of\n\nsymptoms that form ADHD.         Those studies used methodologies that are generally\n\naccepted and their conclusions were not novel in the sense used by the Court in\n\nBlackwell. In these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\na Frye-Reed hearing.\n\n                                               42\n\f       Mr. Rochkind’s related argument about general medical causation is based on his\n\nassertion that the EPA-ISA study is not in line with the consensus in the scientific\n\ncommunity that the cause of ADHD, although unknown, is primarily genetic. He points\n\nout that Dr. Hall-Carrington herself acknowledged that there is a “genetic component” to\n\nADHD and estimated that the condition is 60% hereditary. She also acknowledged that\n\nshe could not quantify the effect of genetics versus lead exposure on attention,\n\nimpulsivity, and hyperactive behaviors, but only could opine that lead exposure was\n\n“additive.”\n\n       Although the scientific studies and publications Mr. Rochkind cited support the\n\nview that ADHD is largely genetic, they do not rule out environmental causes, and some\n\nexpressly rule in lead as a risk factor. As we have explained, the EPA-ISA and other\n\nstudies Dr. Hall-Carrington relied upon support a causal relationship between lead\n\nexposure and ADHD.       The Court in Roy v. Dackman made clear that “even if [a\n\nparticular scientific] study is contrary to the results of other studies,” the fact that an\n\nexpert witness relies upon that study “does not invalidate the entire basis of his [or her]\n\nopinion.” 445 Md. at 51-52 n.16. Rather, “[s]uch is the grist for cross-examination and\n\ndueling experts and for resolution by the relative weight assigned by the fact-finder.” Id.\n\nat 52 n.16.\n\n       With respect to specific medical causation, Mr. Rochkind argues that Ms.\n\nStevenson’s family history of ADHD is a confounding factor that undermined the validity\n\nof any opinion that Ms. Stevenson’s ADHD was caused by exposure to lead. The trial\n\ncourt also did not abuse its discretion by permitting Dr. Hall-Carrington to testify that\n\n                                            43\n\fMs. Stevenson’s lead exposure was a specific cause of her ADHD symptoms. As noted,\n\nDr. Hall-Carrington testified that there is a large genetic component to ADHD, but that\n\nlead exposure is an additive causal factor. She acknowledged that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nmother had been diagnosed with ADHD, as had her half-brother. Her half-brother also\n\nhad been exposed to lead and had elevated blood lead levels, however. Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nhalf-sister had not been exposed to lead and had not been diagnosed with ADHD. 13 The\n\nissue of specific medical causation in this case is governed by the substantial factor test.\n\nDr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion that lead was a substantial causal factor contributing to Ms.\n\nStevenson’s ADHD symptoms was supported by an adequate factual basis and was\n\nsufficient to allow the jury to decide the causal connection, if any, between lead exposure\n\nand Ms. Stevenson’s ADHD.\n\n       2) IQ Loss Opinion\n\n       In his motion in limine seeking to exclude Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinion\n\nquantifying Ms. Stevenson’s IQ loss, Mr. Rochkind argued that the doctor’s calculations\n\nwere not reliable under Frye-Reed and lacked an adequate factual basis under Rule 5-\n\n702(3). Specifically, he maintained that: 1) Dr. Hall-Carrington relied, improperly, on\n\ngeneral population studies to extrapolate that Ms. Stevenson had lost a specific number of\n\nIQ points; 2) there is no consensus in the scientific community about a methodology for\n\n       13\n           Mr. Rochkind’s experts noted that Ms. Stevenson’s half-sister had been\nevaluated for possible ADHD as a child, but was not diagnosed due, in large part, to the\nfact that she was then sleep-deprived. Dr. Munro opined that Ms. Stevenson’s diagnosis\nof ADHD at age 5 may have also resulted from the failure to rule out confounding\nfactors, such as sleep deprivation.\n\n\n                                            44\n\fcalculating IQ loss in a child exposed to lead; and 3) Dr. Hall-Carrington’s methodology\n\nof using Ms. Stevenson’s peak blood-lead level to calculate IQ loss was at odds with the\n\nvery studies she claimed to rely upon. He attached excerpts from Dr. Hall-Carrington’s\n\ndeposition testimony in which she could not explain why she had chosen to use Ms.\n\nStevenson’s peak blood-lead level, as opposed to her lifetime average, even though the\n\nLanphear Study, which she relied upon for her calculations, had used an average. She\n\nalso could not define the term “lifetime average” as used in the Lanphear Study, noting\n\nthat she was “not an epidemiologist.” As discussed, Judge Sfekas declined to hold a\n\nFrye-Reed hearing to assess the basis for Dr. Hall-Carrington’s opinions and denied the\n\nmotion to exclude her IQ opinion.\n\n      At both trials, Dr. Hall-Carrington testified that she had reviewed epidemiologic\n\nstudies concerning the effects of lead on IQ decrements, and opined that there is\n\n“consensus among the studies that children do lose IQ points based on exposure to lead,”\n\nalthough studies “differ in the amount of IQ points that children lose.” Based on her\n\nreview of those studies, Dr. Hall-Carrington opined that, “within a reasonable degree of\n\nmedical certainty,” Ms. Stevenson lost between five and six IQ points as a result of her\n\nexposure to lead.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Hall-Carrington agreed that maternal and paternal IQ, a\n\nchaotic home environment, and moving between many residences and schools all are risk\n\nfactors for cognitive impairment in children. She did not have any information about Ms.\n\nMontgomery’s IQ or Ms. Stevenson’s father’s IQ, but did note that Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nfather was in special education classes during his secondary education.             She\n\n                                          45\n\facknowledged that she had “no way of quantifying” the effect of confounding factors, if\n\nany, on Ms. Stevenson’s IQ. When asked whether she used Ms. Stevenson’s peak blood\n\nlead level (14 µg/dL) or her average blood-lead level (11.5 µg/dL) in forming her opinion\n\nabout the total IQ loss caused by lead exposure, she responded that, based upon the\n\nLanphear Study, she used Ms. Stevenson’s peak blood lead level and calculated an IQ\n\nloss of 3.9 points based upon a level of between zero and ten, 0-10 µg/dL and an\n\nadditional loss of 1.9 points for the level between 10 and 20 µg/dL, for a total of 5.8. She\n\nexplained that her opinion would not have changed if she had used Ms. Stevenson’s\n\naverage blood lead level.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind argues that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting Dr.\n\nHall-Carrington to opine that Ms. Stevenson lost a specific number of IQ points as a\n\nresult of lead exposure because the doctor relied on general population studies to form\n\nthat opinion and because she had no experience administering or interpreting IQ test\n\nscores. In the alternative, he argues the trial court erred by declining to hold a Frye-Reed\n\nhearing and/or a Rule 5-702 hearing to assess the admissibility of Dr. Hall-Carrington’s\n\nIQ loss opinion. He relies, primarily, on City Homes, Inc. v. Hazelwood, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md. App.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">615</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013). Ms. Stevenson takes the position that Roy v.\n\nDackman abrogated Hazelwood, and is dispositive on this issue.14\n\n\n\n\n       14\n           The Court of Appeals’s opinion in Roy was filed the day after Mr. Rochkind\nfiled his opening brief in this Court.\n\n\n                                            46\n\f       In Hazelwood, the trial court in a lead paint case ruled that the plaintiff’s medical\n\ncausation expert, Eric Sundel, M.D., a pediatrician, was qualified to testify that exposure\n\nto lead-based paint can cause a child to lose IQ points and that the plaintiff there had lost\n\nbetween seven and ten IQ points as a result of her exposure to deteriorating lead-based\n\npaint at the subject property. On appeal after a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, this Court\n\nreversed. We held that Dr. Sundel was not qualified to offer an expert opinion on\n\nmedical causation because he had no relevant experience treating children for lead\n\nexposure; had never before testified as an expert in a lead paint poisoning case; and had\n\nno experience evaluating brain impairment in children who have been exposed to lead.\n\nWe concluded that the court abused its discretion, under Rule 5-702(1), by allowing Dr.\n\nSundel to “testify as to [the plaintiff]’s IQ or the loss of IQ points resulting from lead\n\nexposure or any alleged ‘brain impairment.’” Id. at 686. We also found Dr. Sundel’s\n\ntestimony that the plaintiff had lost seven to ten IQ points due to lead paint exposure to\n\nbe “no more than speculation based on articles he read that correlated diminished IQ with\n\nlead exposure.” Id. at 689-90.\n\n       In Roy v. Dackman, one of the issues before the Court of Appeals was whether the\n\ncircuit court had abused its discretion by precluding a pediatrician—in fact, Dr. Sundel,\n\nthe same pediatrician as in Hazelwood—from testifying about medical causation, in\n\nparticular, loss of IQ points resulting from childhood exposure to lead. The Court held\n\nthat although Dr. Sundel might “not be the most qualified expert witness” on that subject,\n\nhe was “competent . . . to testify” about it. 445 Md. at 43. The Court noted that there\n\nwere “material differences” between the record in Hazelwood and the record in the case\n\n                                             47\n\fbefore it with respect to Dr. Sundel’s qualifications. Id. at 49. It characterized as “overly\n\ndemanding” this Court’s holding in Hazelwood that Dr. Sundel was not qualified because\n\nhe “lacked ‘specialized knowledge concerning childhood lead poisoning, and\n\nspecifically, the determination of the source of a child’s lead exposure and causation.’”\n\nId. The Court emphasized, moreover, that since Hazelwood, Dr. Sundel had “endeavored\n\nto be more specific and shore-up the supposed deficiencies in his qualifications,” by\n\nreviewing and keeping up to date on publications about lead paint poisoning in children;\n\nand he had relied on the Lanphear Study, which is a well-known, although controversial,\n\nepidemiological study concerning IQ loss and childhood lead poisoning. Id. at 50. The\n\nCourt concluded that the circuit court had abused its discretion by excluding Dr. Sundel’s\n\nmedical causation opinion:\n\n               Dr. Sundel’s academic and experiential qualifications include a three\n       year pediatric residency in New York, a two year pediatric fellowship at\n       Johns Hopkins University Hospital, and more than 20 years in practice.\n       With this experience and as a board-certified pediatrician, Dr. Sundel was\n       shown on this record to possess a sufficient background from which to\n       provide an opinion as to the injuries claimed to have been suffered by [the\n       plaintiff] as the result of alleged exposure to lead. Whether a jury will find\n       his testimony persuasive will depend, in large measure, on the effectiveness\n       of [defendants]’ cross-examination and a comparison/weighing by the jury\n       against [defendants]’ competing witness(es)’ testimony.\n\nId. at 52.\n\n       It is clear from Roy that a pediatrician need not have specialized knowledge in the\n\narea of IQ test administration and interpretation to render a medical causation opinion\n\nthat exposure to lead-based paint resulted in a loss of IQ points. It also is clear from Roy\n\nthat this dispute did not trigger the need for a Frye-Reed hearing. 445 Md. at 33 n.9\n\n\n                                             48\n\f(stating with respect to defense counsel’s argument that Dr. Sundel’s IQ loss opinion was\n\n“sheer speculation” that “[i]t is clear from the extensive medical/scientific research on the\n\neffects of lead paint exposure on children that expert opinions relating to this topic do not\n\ntrigger generally the need for a Frye/Reed hearing and analysis”).\n\n       Because, as Mr. Rochkind acknowledges, there is a scientific consensus that lead\n\npoisoning causes IQ loss, the only issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nallowing Dr. Hall-Carrington to opine that Ms. Stevenson sustained a specific IQ loss of\n\nbetween five and six points. Dr. Hall-Carrington formed her opinion by extrapolating\n\nfrom epidemiological studies quantifying IQ loss resulting from lead exposure in the\n\ngeneral population to estimate the range of IQ loss in an individual. The court accepted\n\nthis methodology as sound. This was not an abuse of discretion. Dr. Hall-Carrington’s\n\nopinion that lead exposure was a substantial factor in causing the loss of a specific\n\nnumber of IQ points was not novel. See, e.g., N.B.S., Inc. v. Harvey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2070730\"><a href=\"/opinion/2070730/nbs-v-harvey/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.

Although her reasons for using Ms. Stevenson’s peak\n\nblood level were vague, she explained that the range of IQ loss would not have differed\n\nhad she used Ms. Stevenson’s average level. Mr. Rochkind’s experts also opined to a\n\n                                             49\n\frange of IQ loss—albeit a smaller range—based upon Ms. Stevenson’s blood lead levels.\n\nUnlike Dr. Sundel’s vague and variable IQ loss opinion in Hazelwood, Dr. Hall-\n\nCarrington’s IQ loss opinion was supported by an adequate factual basis.\n\n                                           III.\n\n                                   Mark Lieberman\n\n      Mr. Rochkind contends the trial court erred by permitting Mr. Lieberman, a\n\ncertified rehabilitation counselor, to opine that, but for Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive\n\ndeficits, she would have functioned in the marketplace as an “average high school\n\ngraduate.” He complains that Mr. Lieberman was not qualified to offer that opinion and\n\nhis methodology was unsound. Specifically, Mr. Rochkind argues that Mr. Lieberman\n\nassumed, improperly, that all the impairments identified in Dr. Kraft’s report were caused\n\nby lead exposure when Dr. Kraft did not make that determination.\n\n      Ms. Stevenson responds that Dr. Hall-Carrington’s testimony established that the\n\nneuropsychological deficits Dr. Kraft identified were caused by exposure to lead-based\n\npaint and that Mr. Lieberman properly relied upon that testimony as the basis for his\n\nvocational opinion.\n\n      Mr. Lieberman’s testimony concerned vocational marketability. He was asked to\n\nreview Ms. Stevenson’s file after the sudden death of Martin Klitzner, a vocational\n\ncounselor who had met with Ms. Stevenson in January of 2013. He reviewed all of Ms.\n\nStevenson’s records and Mr. Klitzner’s report and also met with Ms. Stevenson in the\n\ninterim between the First and Second Trials. He assessed Ms. Stevenson’s employment\n\n\n\n                                           50\n\fcapacity using the RAPEL method (Rehabilitation plan; Access to the labor market;\n\nPlaceability; Earning capacity; and Labor force participation).\n\n        Mr. Lieberman opined that Ms. Stevenson was functionally illiterate, had ADHD,\n\nand would require a high level of supervision and direction in the workplace. She had\n\nfailed the entrance examinations for Baltimore City Community College and had been\n\nadvised to take pre-remedial continuing education classes to try to improve her academic\n\nabilities.   Mr. Lieberman further opined that Ms. Stevenson’s low IQ, ADHD, and\n\nfunctional illiteracy all were deficits that would adversely affect her vocational\n\nplacement. As a result of these deficits, Ms. Stevenson only would be able to find\n\nemployment in “very low skill positions requiring limited independent decision making,\n\nlimited ability to read and remember information and require a high level of supervision.”\n\nThese are “unskilled manual labor” jobs that pay “at or near minimum wage.” He\n\ntestified that she would likely only be able to work part-time. In addition, in order to\n\nmaintain employment, she would require the services of a job coach for “a couple hours a\n\nweek.” According to Mr. Lieberman, a job coach typically charges about $38 an hour.\n\n        Mr. Lieberman opined that, but for her IQ loss of five to six points, Ms.\n\nStevenson’s vocational abilities would have been within the “average range.” He opined\n\nthat under the PEEDS-RAPEL method,15 vocational counselors focus on parental and\n\nfamily history in assessing the vocational prospects of the child. Ms. Stevenson’s mother\n\n\n        15\n         PEEDS is an acronym for: Parental/family occupations; Educational attainment;\nEvaluation results; Developmental stage; Synthesis.\n\n\n                                            51\n\f(Ms. Montgomery) had graduated from high school; had been employed as an EMT; had\n\nobtained her CDL license; had worked as a correctional officer; and was a certified\n\nphlebotomist. Ms. Stevenson’s father had earned his GED; had managed a Kentucky\n\nFried Chicken franchise; and had obtained his CDL license as well. Mr. Lieberman\n\nopined that he would expect Ms. Stevenson to perform as well or better vocationally than\n\nher parents, but, in light of her cognitive deficits, that was not possible. His ultimate\n\nopinion was that Ms. Stevenson would be limited to obtaining “basic jobs” earning the\n\nminimum wage (then $7.25/hour), for an annual salary of around $15,000.\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Mr. Lieberman’s expert\n\ntestimony about Ms. Stevenson’s vocational prospects with and without her cognitive\n\ndeficits. Mr. Lieberman’s expertise was in the area of vocational rehabilitation. He was\n\nnot asked to opine, nor did he opine, about the etiology of Ms. Stevenson’s cognitive\n\nimpairment.   That issue was the subject of Dr. Hall-Carrington’s testimony.         Mr.\n\nLieberman’s opinions that with her cognitive deficits Ms. Stevenson would only be able\n\nto attain part-time, minimum wage employment and that, but for these deficits, she could\n\nhave achieved greater earnings typical of an average high-school graduate were\n\nadequately supported by facts in evidence and were not based on speculation or\n\nconjecture.

Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting Mr. Lieberman’s opinion testimony, it did not abuse its discretion in admitting\n\nDr. Conte’s opinion because it was based on Mr. Lieberman’s opinion testimony.\n\n                                            V.\n\n                                     Dr. Brookshire\n\n       On direct examination, Dr. Brookshire, who, as mentioned, was Mr. Rochkind’s\n\neconomics expert, testified that Ms. Stevenson had “not sustained any loss of earning\n\ncapacity or work-life expectancy due to claimed exposure to lead.” He then was asked\n\nabout his familiarity with “a series of studies by medical economists on the effect of lead\n\non lifetime earning capacity.” He identified three studies on that topic, one of which\n\nquantifies “loss of lifetime earnings related to micrograms per deciliter of blood lead\n\nexposure that an individual might have.” When he was asked to explain how he had used\n\nthose figures and “updated it using appropriate economic means for present value,” Ms.\n\nStevenson objected.\n\n       At the bench, Ms. Stevenson’s counsel argued that because Dr. Brookshire’s\n\nopinion was that Ms. Stevenson had not sustained any loss of earnings whatsoever due to\n\nher lead exposure, he could not have relied on the studies quantifying the loss of earnings\n\nbased on blood lead levels in formulating his opinion. Moreover, he had not disclosed\n\n                                            53\n\fany opinion based upon these studies before trial. Counsel for Mr. Rochkind proffered\n\nthat Dr. Brookshire would testify that, based upon her blood lead levels, Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nloss of earnings caused by lead exposure would not exceed $8,000.\n\n       The court agreed with Ms. Stevenson, ruling that because Dr. Brookshire had not\n\nrelied on the studies in question in formulating his expert opinion and because Dr. Conte\n\nalso had not relied on them, the data from the studies would not be helpful to the jury and\n\nwas not admissible under Rule 5-703(b).\n\n       Mr. Rochkind contends this ruling was an abuse of discretion. He maintains that\n\nthe studies were relevant to show that Dr. Brookshire’s “damages estimate was consistent\n\nwith the existing scientific literature” and, “[m]ore importantly, [they] w[ere] offered to\n\nrefute Dr. Conte’s opinion.” Ms. Stevenson responds that the court acted within its\n\ndiscretion to preclude Dr. Brookshire from giving an opinion at trial that was not\n\ndisclosed in discovery and was not consistent with his disclosed opinion that Ms.\n\nStevenson had not suffered any economic loss.\n\n       Rule 5-703, entitled “Bases of opinion testimony by experts,” states:\n\n       (a) In general. The facts or data in the particular case upon which an expert\n       bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or made known to\n       the expert at or before the hearing. If of a type reasonably relied upon by\n       experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the\n       subject, the facts or data need not be admissible in evidence.\n\n       (b) Disclosure to jury. If determined to be trustworthy, necessary to\n       illuminate testimony, and unprivileged, facts or data reasonably relied upon\n       by an expert pursuant to section (a) may, in the discretion of the court, be\n       disclosed to the jury even if those facts and data are not admissible in\n       evidence. Upon request, the court shall instruct the jury to use those facts\n       and data only for the purpose of evaluating the validity and probative value\n       of the expert’s opinion or inference.\n\n                                            54\n\f        (c) Right to challenge expert. This Rule does not limit the right of an\n       opposing party to cross-examine an expert witness or to test the basis of the\n       expert’s opinion or inference.\n\n       The “facts or data” at issue were not “reasonably relied upon” by Dr. Brookshire\n\nin forming his expert opinion that Ms. Stevenson did not sustain any economic loss as a\n\nresult of her exposure to lead. While it may have been appropriate to cross-examine Dr.\n\nConte about these studies, the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the\n\nunderlying calculations were not admissible in evidence by Mr. Rochkind through Dr.\n\nBrookshire.\n\n                                           VI.\n\n                              Collateral Source Evidence\n\n       During Mr. Lieberman’s testimony, Ms. Stevenson’s records from the DORS\n\nprogram were admitted into evidence. Certain of those records included boiler-plate\n\nlanguage stating that DORS clients who are eligible for SSI or SSDI benefits are\n\n“excluded from participation in cost of services,” meaning that the services they receive\n\nthrough DORS are free. As mentioned, Ms. Crowder, from DORS, testified that this\n\nwould include the cost of post-employment job-coaching to the extent a client qualifies\n\nfor that service.\n\n       Defense counsel sought to question Dr. Conte about the DORS records to\n\ndetermine whether, in reaching his economic loss opinion, he had considered the\n\npossibility of Ms. Stevenson’s receiving free job coaching through DORS. As discussed,\n\nDr. Conte had opined that Ms. Stevenson’s entire future earnings would be offset by the\n\n\n                                            55\n\fcost of a permanent job coach. The court heard argument and ruled that the collateral\n\nsource rule precluded any reference to the cost of DORS services.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind contends this was error. He argues that, even if the collateral source\n\ndoctrine applied, once Ms. Stevenson moved the DORS records into evidence without\n\nany restriction on their use, he was free to use them to cross-examine Ms. Stevenson’s\n\nwitnesses. Ms. Stevenson responds that the court properly limited cross-examination to\n\nprevent evidence about payment of services by an entity or individual other than the\n\nalleged tortfeasor.\n\n       Maryland adheres to the rule that “an injured person [may] recover in tort the full\n\namount of his provable damages regardless of the amount of compensation which the\n\nperson has received for his injuries from sources unrelated to the tortfeasor.” Motor\n\nVehicle Admin. v.

Ms. Stevenson’s introduction into evidence of all the DORS documents,\n\nincluding those reflecting a policy not to charge clients for services if they are eligible for\n\nSSI or SSDI benefits, did not operate to waive the collateral source rule. The court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion by precluding defense counsel from asking Dr. Conte if he had\n\nfactored this collateral source into his economic loss opinion.\n\n                                    CROSS-APPEAL\n\n                                      Attorneys’ Fees\n\n       The CPA “specifically prohibits any person from engaging in unfair and deceptive\n\nprocedures in the rental or offer for rental of consumer realty.” Golt v.

As this language makes clear, the decision to award\n\nfees under the CPA is discretionary.\n\n       In this case, Ms. Stevenson’s complaint set forth claims for negligence and for\n\nunfair or deceptive trade practices under the CPA. In the First Trial, the jurors were\n\nasked whether they found “that [the Fairview Property] contained chipping, flaking, or\n\npeeling paint at the beginning of the tenancy?” They answered that question in the\n\naffirmative. Thus, the jurors found as a fact that Mr. Rochkind had committed an unfair\n\nor deceptive trade practice by renting the Fairview Property to Ms. Stevenson in a\n\ncondition that was not fit for habitation.\n\n\n\n                                              57\n\f       On December 10, 2014, following the Second Trial, Ms. Stevenson filed a petition\n\nfor prevailing party attorneys’ fees under CL section 13-408(b). She attached a copy of\n\nher retainer agreement with her attorneys, in which she promised to pay them a\n\ncontingency fee equal to forty percent of any sum recovered, plus expenses. She also\n\nattached a “Client Expense Itemization” listing expenses totaling $135,513.81. She asked\n\nthe court to award her the full contingency fee ($437,200) and all expenses, for a total of\n\n$572,713.81.\n\n       Alternatively, Ms. Stevenson asked the court to grant her an award of attorneys’\n\nfees using the lodestar approach. She attached a “Time Chart” detailing work performed\n\non her case by Scott Nevin, the lead attorney, and by Robert Leonard, an associate. She\n\ndid not include time billed by paralegals and law clerks. In an attached affidavit, Mr.\n\nNevin attested that when Ms. Stevenson retained him he had been licensed as an attorney\n\nin Maryland for nearly 30 years, half of which he had spent specializing in lead paint\n\npoisoning cases. Mr. Leonard had been licensed in Maryland for seven years. The time\n\nchart calculated hours in two time frames: the period from December 19, 2011, through\n\nMarch 17, 2014, and the period from March 17, 2014, through November of 2014. The\n\nchart reflected that Mr. Nevin worked on the case for 116.5 hours in the first period and\n\nan additional 62.75 hours thereafter; and that Mr. Leonard worked 221.25 hours in the\n\nfirst period and an additional 105.5 hours thereafter. Although the Mr. Nevin’s affidavit\n\ndid not explain why the hours were broken into these two periods, it is clear that the first\n\n\n\n\n                                            58\n\fperiod covers all litigation in the First Trial and the second period covers all litigation in\n\nthe Second Trial.16\n\n       Ms. Stevenson also attached to her petition the “Laffey Matrix” for 2014-2015.\n\nThe Laffey Matrix, which is prepared by the Civil Division of the United States\n\nAttorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, suggests appropriate hourly rates for\n\nattorneys based upon years of experience. The Laffey Matrix for 2014-2015 suggested\n\nan hourly rate of $520 per hour for attorneys with more than twenty years’ experience\n\nand an hourly rate of $300 per hour for attorneys with between 4-7 years’ experience.\n\nMs. Stevenson argued, based on the Laffey Matrix, that a reasonable hourly rate for Mr.\n\nNevin was $700 per hour for the first period and $725 per hour for the second period; and\n\na reasonable hourly rate for Mr. Leonard was $400 per hour for the first period and $425\n\nper hour for the second period.       Using these rates, she asked the court to award her\n\n$260,381.25 in fees plus the $135,513.81 in expenses, for a total of $395,895.06.\n\n       Mr. Rochkind filed an opposition to the fee petition. As relevant here, he argued\n\nthat the fee-shifting provision of the CPA is not intended to apply to personal injury\n\nactions that are alternatively styled as unfair trade practice actions; that Ms. Stevenson is\n\nnot permitted to recover her contingency fee or expenses under the CPA; and that Ms.\n\n\n\n\n       16\n            The verdict in the First Trial was returned on March 18, 2014.\n\n\n                                              59\n\fStevenson failed to provide “sufficient information so that [the circuit court] might\n\nconduct the analysis it is required to conduct under Maryland law.” 17\n\n       On January 30, 2015, the court heard argument on the petition and, on March 18,\n\n2015, it entered an order denying it. The court set out the guidelines for awarding\n\nattorneys’ fees under the CPA. It explained that the first step is to engage in a lodestar\n\nanalysis by “‘multiplying “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation . . .\n\nby a reasonable hourly rate”’” to “‘arrive at a “useful starting point.”’” (Quoting Friolo v.\n\nFrankel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2308299\"><a href=\"/opinion/2308299/friolo-v-frankel/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453-54 (2008) (“Friolo II”), in turn quoting Friolo v.

The second step involves consideration of the factors enumerated in Rule 1.5\n\nof the Maryland Lawyers’ Rules of Professional Conduct (“MLRPC”) governing fees\n\ncharged.18\n\n       The court found that, in light of the jury’s answer to the first question on the\n\nspecial verdict sheet at the First Trial, Ms. Stevenson was a prevailing party on her CPA\n\n\n       17\n         In his opposition and in his motion for new trial, Mr. Rochkind argued that the\nCPA claim should not have been submitted to the jury at the First Trial because Ms.\nMontgomery testified that the property was freshly painted at the inception of the\ntenancy. He does not advance that argument on appeal.\n       18\n          Those factors include “the time and labor required,” “the novelty and difficulty\nof the questions involved,” and the “likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the\nacceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment of the lawyer,”\nand “the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the\nservices.” Md. Rule 16-812, MLRPC 1.5.\n\n\n                                             60\n\fclaim. It also found that “[h]er claims of negligence and violation of the CPA, which\n\nyielded successful jury verdicts in both trials, arose from ‘a common core of facts’ and\n\n‘related legal theories.’” (Quoting Friolo I, at 524). In the court’s view, the “causes of\n\naction [negligence and the CPA violation] essentially were indivisible in the presentation\n\nof operative facts during the [F]irst [T]rial” and “there was no differentiation between the\n\ntwo causes of action in terms of proof and determination of damages” in the Second\n\nTrial.    The court also determined that only attorneys’ fees, not expenses or fees\n\nattributable to non-attorneys, may be awarded under the CPA.\n\n         Turning to whether a fee award was appropriate, the court found that the “Time\n\nChart” and the Nevin Affidavit were too vague for it to apply the lodestar method. The\n\nTime Chart did not “state the actual time or describe the tasks undertaken to investigate\n\n[Ms. Stevenson’s] claims, communicate with the client and witnesses, draft pleadings,\n\nreview other parties’ pleadings, prepare interrogatories, request document production,\n\nprepare for depositions, engage in motions practice, attend court hearings for particular\n\npurposes, or address alternative dispute resolution.”\n\n         The court also took issue with Ms. Stevenson’s use of the “Laffey Matrix,” noting\n\nthat it is “a mechanism for calculating reasonable attorney’s fees in Washington, D.C.,”\n\nnot in Baltimore. The court observed that the hourly rates listed in Appendix B to the\n\nLocal Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland are “more apt\n\n\n\n\n                                            61\n\fand comparable.”19       Finally, the court concluded that it could not assess the\n\nreasonableness of the fee request because the Nevin Affidavit did not address “whether\n\nand how he was prevented from taking on any new cases by the inconvenience of\n\nconducting the two trials in this case.”\n\n       For all these reasons, the court determined that Ms. Stevenson had not “provide[d]\n\nsufficient information to allow th[e] court to make the reasoned and well supported\n\nanalysis required” for an award of fees; nor did the docket entries provide “specific\n\ninformation as to what an appropriate fee might be.” The Nevin Affidavit and the Time\n\nChart “offer[ed] some information as to some of the enumerated factors” but failed “to\n\noffer sufficient detail to satisfy many of the remaining criteria.” Due to the lack of\n\ninformation, the court found itself unable to “inject some reasonableness into fees sought\n\nby [Ms. Stevenson’s] counsel.” It thus denied the petition for fees.\n\n       Within ten-days of the entry of that order, Ms. Stevenson moved for\n\nreconsideration. She argued that the court abused its discretion by denying the fee\n\npetition because it did not exercise any discretion in doing so. She emphasized that the\n\ncourt had discretion to assess the reasonableness of the hourly rates and to lower the rates\n\nrequested, such as by applying rates consistent with Appendix B. She maintained that\n\n\n       19\n         Section 3 of Appendix B sets forth “Guidelines Regarding Hourly Rates.” For\nthe period between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2014, the guideline rate for lawyers\nadmitted to the bar for between five to eight years was $165-250 per hour and for lawyers\nadmitted to the bar for 15 years or more was $275-400 per hour. Effective July 1, 2014,\nthe lower range was amended to between $165-300 per hour and a new guideline range\nwas added for lawyers admitted to the bar for 20 years or more of $300-475 per hour.\n\n\n                                            62\n\fMr. Leonard and Mr. Nevin were entitled to the hourly rate at the high end of the ranges\n\nprovided in Appendix B ($300 per hour for Mr. Leonard and $475 per hour for Mr.\n\nNevin). She maintained that the court failed to exercise its discretion when it did not even\n\ncalculate a lodestar figure and assess the reasonableness of the fees sought under that\n\nmethodology.\n\n         By order entered on June 8, 2015, the court denied the motion for reconsideration.\n\nIt noted that Ms. Stevenson did not take issue with the court’s legal analysis, but with the\n\napplication of the law to the facts. It reiterated that the Time Chart failed to distinguish\n\nbetween time spent on the CPA claim and time spent on the negligence claim.               It\n\nconcluded that, “[w]ithout evidence sufficiently detailing the time [Ms. Stevenson]’s\n\nattorneys spent on the entire case, let alone the CPA claim,” the court “would be\n\nengaging in speculation for the ‘number of hours reasonably expended’ portion of the\n\nreasonable fee analysis.” Thus, even if the court had been able to determine a reasonable\n\nhourly rate, it was unable, with the information furnished, to “engage in the case-specific,\n\ndetail-oriented, and thorough analysis required in order to grant an award of attorneys’\n\nfees.”\n\n         On appeal, Ms. Stevenson contends the circuit court abused its discretion by not\n\nawarding her any attorneys’ fees under the CPA. She maintains that the court failed to\n\nexercise any discretion to “determine a reasonable hourly rate based on [its] own\n\nknowledge and experience,” coupled with the Laffey Matrix and Appendix B. And,\n\nhaving found that the CPA claim and the negligence claim were “essentially . . .\n\n\n\n                                             63\n\findivisible,” the court abused its discretion by not awarding her attorneys’ fees for “all of\n\nthe time that counsel spent on the litigation.”\n\n       Mr. Rochkind responds that the court properly exercised its discretion to deny the\n\nfee petition because Ms. Stevenson failed to present adequate proof of the appropriate\n\nhourly rate and the number of hours reasonably expended on her CPA claim. With\n\nrespect to the hourly rate, he maintains that Ms. Stevenson had to “provide specific\n\nevidence, such as expert testimony or affidavits demonstrating that attorneys with similar\n\nqualifications have received in the past the same fees for similar work conducted in the\n\nsame jurisdiction.” This was especially so given that her counsel had not provided any\n\nexplanation for how they had arrived at the requested hourly rates, which far exceeded\n\nthe amounts shown on the Laffey Matrix.           With respect to the hours reasonably\n\nexpended, Mr. Rochkind asserts that the Time Chart was “entirely inadequate,” both\n\nbecause it lacked sufficient detail and because it failed to “segregate the time spent on the\n\nCPA claim from the time spent on other claims.” Alternatively, he argues that an award\n\nof fees is not appropriate in a case of this type because it is a personal injury action and\n\nbecause it is impossible to divine from the verdict in the First Trial whether the jury\n\nawarded damages for violation of the CPA or on the negligence claim.\n\n       In Richwind, 335 Md. at 687, the Court of Appeals expressed doubt that an award\n\nof attorneys’ fees under section 13-408(b) of the CPA would be appropriate in a case like\n\nthe one at bar:\n\n              The instant case is fundamentally a personal injury action. It is\n       questionable whether the legislature intended to abrogate the long-standing\n       rule that attorney fees are not recoverable in personal injury actions, and to\n\n                                             64\n\f       permit plaintiffs who recover tort damages for personal injuries also to\n       recover attorney fees in such actions by bringing them under the CPA.\n       Based on our holding that the CPA is not applicable, we need not reach the\n       issue of whether attorney’s fees could properly be awarded in a personal\n       injury tort action based on an additional count which alleges the tort was\n       also a violation of the CPA.\n\n       Like in Richwind, in this case, Ms. Stevenson prosecuted a quintessential personal\n\ninjury action, but alleged that “the tort was also a violation of the CPA.” We need not\n\ndecide whether an award of prevailing party fees ever would be appropriate in such an\n\naction, however, because we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by\n\ndenying the petition in any event.\n\n       Putting aside that Ms. Stevenson requested an award of her total contingency fee\n\nand an award of expenses, both of which are plainly prohibited, she asked, in the\n\nalternative, for the court to use the lodestar method and apply hourly rates that were not\n\nsupported by any evidence. The beginning rate proposed for Mr. Nevin was $700 per\n\nhour, $180 per hour more than the rate in the Laffey Matrix and $225 per hour more than\n\nthe high end of the range in Appendix B for an attorney with his experience. The\n\nbeginning rate proposed for Mr. Leonard—$400 per hour—exceeded the Laffey Matrix\n\nrate and the high end of the Appendix B rate by $100 per hour. Ms. Stevenson did not\n\npresent any evidence to justify the use of the Laffey Matrix for a case tried in Baltimore\n\nCity or to justify an upward departure from those rates.             In her motion for\n\nreconsideration, she argued that the court should have applied Appendix B, but did not\n\n\n\n\n                                           65\n\foffer any explanation as to why her counsel were entitled to fees at the high end of the\n\napplicable ranges.20\n\n       And most significantly, Ms. Stevenson did not provide evidence from which the\n\ncourt could determine the number of attorney hours reasonably expended on Ms.\n\nStevenson’s CPA claim. The Time Chart lacks the detail to do so. For example, as\n\nmentioned, Ms. Stevenson originally sued four other defendants. The Time Chart does\n\nnot specify and segregate hours spent investigating the claims against those defendants.\n\nMs. Stevenson’s proof that there was deteriorated lead-based paint at the inception of her\n\ntenancy at the Fairview Property—all that was needed to establish the CPA violation—\n\nwas Ms. Montgomery’s and White’s testimony to that effect. Had the jurors found\n\nagainst her on that issue, it would not have been fatal to her remaining negligence claim,\n\nwhich was premised on Mr. Rochkind’s being on notice of the existence of deteriorated\n\nlead-based paint at any time during her tenancy. As Judge White found, however, Ms.\n\nStevenson made no attempt to separate out the hours spent developing and presenting\n\nevidence on the discrete CPA claim from the hours spent on the bulk of this personal\n\ninjury negligence action. Given the dearth of evidence that would allow the court to\n\nassess the reasonableness of the attorney hours spent in prosecuting the CPA claim, the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying the fee petition.\n\n       20\n         Ms. Stevenson also did not explain why the hourly rates for Mr. Leonard and\nMr. Nevin during the period between December 2011 and June 2014 should not have\nbeen calculated under Appendix B to the then applicable Local Rules, which would have\nreduced the high end amount for Mr. Leonard from $300 to $250 and the high end\namount for Mr. Nevin from $475 to $400.\n\n\n                                             66\n\fJUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT\nFOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.\nCOSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY THE\nAPPELLANT/CROSS-APPELLEE     AND\nONE-HALF BY THE APPELLEE/CROSS-\nAPPELLANT.\n\n\n\n\n 67\n\f</pre>",
