The  expert<br>          testified that this reduction to present value could have brought<br>          the present value of the redemption price as of December 3, 1984,<br>          as low as $114,638.<br><br>               2.

Dopp and<br><br>          Jay  A. Pritzker.   The  litigation stems  from an  oral contract<br><br>          between the two men  concerning the purchase of the  Dorado Beach<br><br>          Hotel Corporation  (DBHC), a company that controlled a complex of<br><br>          hotels and golf courses situated on  1,000 beachfront acres along<br><br>          the north shore of Puerto Rico.<br><br>                    In an earlier opinion we  upheld a jury verdict finding<br><br>          Pritzker liable to Dopp, but vacated both the jury's damage award<br><br>          and  the  trial  court's  rulings in  connection  with  equitable<br><br>          relief.   See Dopp  v. HTP  Corp., 947 F.2d  506 (1st  Cir. 1991)\r                    ___ ____     __________<br><br>          (Dopp II).  On remand, the district court held a  second trial to\r           _______<br><br>          determine Dopp's entitlement to various forms of relief.  After a<br><br>          jury returned a series  of special findings, see Fed.  R. Civ.

Since the latter  appeals (Nos. 93-2374,<br>          94-1128, and 94-1129,  respectively) involve segregable issues   <br>          they  focus on  a  series of  financing  agreements entered  into<br>          between Dopp  and three financiers, Robert  Yari, Lincoln Realty,<br>          Inc.,  and Baird  Patrick  &amp; Co.,  for  the apparent  purpose  of<br>          funding Dopp's litigatory  efforts    we will address  them in  a<br>          separate and subsequent opinion.<br><br>                                          4\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          niggardly, as Dopp  asserts; and (3)  whether the district  court<br><br>          appropriately  awarded  Dopp  attorneys'  fees   and  prejudgment<br><br>          interest,  based  on its  determination  that  Pritzker displayed<br><br>          obstinacy  in  conducting  the   litigation.

He secured the option<br><br>          with a $2,000,000  letter of credit supplied  with the assistance<br><br>          of Island Resorts,  S.A. (IRSA), a  Panamanian corporation.   The<br><br>          option agreement specified that the  underlying purchase-and-sale<br><br>          transaction would be consummated no later than December 3, 1984.<br><br>                    Though playing for high stakes, Dopp had relatively few<br><br>          chips of  his own.   Thus, he  immediately set out  in search  of<br><br>          financial backing.  He encountered heavy seas.  With time running<br><br>          out,  Dopp turned  to  Pritzker.   The  parties reached  an  oral<br><br>          agreement on November 30, 1984.  Under its terms, Pritzker agreed<br><br><br>                                          5\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          to  provide the funds needed  to seal the  purchase and reimburse<br><br>          Dopp's  and IRSA's costs.  In exchange, Dopp agreed that Pritzker<br><br>          would  receive an 80% equity  interest in a  holding company that<br><br>          would be formed  to acquire  DBHC's stock, and,  as a  sweetener,<br><br>          that  a Pritzker affiliate would be given a long-term contract to<br><br>          manage the hotels coincident with the closing.<br><br>                    The parties  formed HTP  Corporation (HTP) to  serve as<br><br>          the holding company.   Dopp controlled 20% of HTP's  stock in the<br><br>          first  instance, but ceded some shares to IRSA in accordance with<br><br>          a prior arrangement.  In the end, Dopp retained a 12% interest in<br><br>          HTP.    Meanwhile,  Pritzker,  through a  nominee,  held  an  80%<br><br>          interest.2<br><br>                    On December 3,  1984, Pritzker presented  two documents<br><br>          to Dopp that supposedly embodied their oral  agreement.  Pritzker<br><br>          injected  into one  of these  documents   the  stock subscription<br><br>          agreement  (SSA)    a  clause granting  the majority  shareholder<br><br>          (Pritzker) an option to retire the stock held by the two minority<br><br>          shareholders (Dopp and IRSA) for $50,000 per share, or $1,000,000<br><br>          in the aggregate, at any time within 10 years.  With the purchase<br><br>          option due  to expire, the move put  Dopp at a huge disadvantage.<br><br>          He signed the documents.<br><br>                    After HTP obtained a one-day extension from the seller,<br><br>          it  closed the underlying transaction  on December 4,  1984.  HTP<br><br>          bought  DBHC's stock  for  $36,846,000, net  of adjustments;  the<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               2For  ease in  reference,  we ignore  the  nominee, a  shell<br>          corporation, and  treat  Pritzker as  if  he, himself,  were  the<br>          majority shareholder.<br><br>                                          6\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          seller canceled  the letter  of credit; Pritzker  reimbursed Dopp<br><br>          and IRSA  for expenses advanced  ($710,000); and Dopp  received a<br><br>          prearranged $200,000 \"consulting fee.\"<br><br>                                 B.

After  a 10-day trial, a jury  found<br><br>          in  Dopp's favor, determining that the parties had formed an oral<br><br>          contract on November 30, 1984, and that, thereafter, Pritzker had<br><br>          employed deceit and duress to pressure Dopp into signing the SSA,<br><br>          thereby   violating  the   oral   contract.     Based  on   these<br><br>          determinations,  the jury  awarded  Dopp  $2,000,000 in  damages.<br><br>          Thereafter,  the district  court,  acting in  response to  Dopp's<br><br>          motion under  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 59(e), declared  the SSA  null and<br><br>          void in  respect to Dopp's shares  in HTP, but  declined to order<br><br>          resolution of the oral contract.3<br><br>                    The  first trial  produced no  fewer than  ten appeals.<br><br>          After considering them, we upheld the liability determination but<br><br>          vacated  both the damage award  and the district court's remedial<br><br>          rulings, see  Dopp II, 947  F.2d at  520.

RESOLUTION<br><br>                    In our earlier opinion, we determined that up  to three<br><br>          main remedies might  be available to  Dopp, namely, annulment  of<br><br>          the SSA, resolution of the oral  contract, or full damages.

The  jurors<br><br>          complied.  Following the jury's calculation of potential damages,<br><br>          the judge asked  Dopp to elect a remedy.   Dopp chose resolution.<br><br>          Much  to his  dismay, the  district court  ruled that,  given the<br><br>          evidence, resolution was unobtainable.   Under protest, Dopp then<br><br>          elected an alternate remedy:  full damages.

If it is true<br><br>          that  Dopp, prior  and  pursuant to  the  formation of  the  oral<br><br>          contract,  \"fully expected  that there  would be  some reasonable<br><br>          option\"   as  he, himself, testified    and yet proceeded  to the<br><br>          written contract phase without settling this matter precisely, it<br><br>          seems eminently reasonable  for a factfinder to conclude that the<br><br>          element of non-encumbrance could not have been  the raison d'etre\r                                                              _____________<br><br>          of the oral contract.<br><br>                    What is more, the plausibility of this conclusion rests<br><br>          not  only on  Dopp's  own words,  but  also on  other  witnesses'<br><br><br>                                          18\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          testimony  to the  effect that, when  ownership is  closely held,<br><br>          buy-out  options  are  a  regular  attribute  of  intra-corporate<br><br>          arrangements.   For our  part, we regard  this truth  to be self-<br><br>          evident; indeed, it is difficult to imagine an 80% shareholder of<br><br>          a close  corporation owning  extremely valuable assets  who would<br><br>          not  routinely demand  such protection.   Pritzker may  have been<br><br>          many things,  but, as Dopp well  knew, he was  neither a neophyte<br><br>          nor  an altruist.  Hence, Dopp could not reasonably have expected<br><br>          that Pritzker  would forgo so  elementary a precaution  and leave<br><br>          the minority stock unfettered.<br><br>                    The  interest in preservation  and ultimate fulfillment<br><br>          of contracts that drives article 1077, see Ramirez, ___ P.R.

Here,<br><br>          Pritzker's breach did not  render the contract inherently infirm.<br><br>          To  be sure, the breach harmed Dopp, but his insistent focus upon<br><br>          the harm begs the real question.  The critical determinant of the<br><br>          availability  of a resultory remedy  is neither the  fact nor the<br><br>          magnitude  of  the inflicted  injury,  but,  rather, whether  the<br><br>          defaulting  party's breach irretrievably undermined the contract.<br><br>          In  this instance,  the district  court thought  not; and  we can<br><br>          scarcely  conclude, based  on  the evidence  presented, that  its<br><br>          decision was clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    In a last-ditch effort to  turn the tide, Dopp  insists<br><br>          that the  unreasonableness of the particular  buy-out clause that<br><br>          Pritzker   inserted  into  the   SSA  somehow  transmogrifies  an<br><br>          accessory obligation  into an  essential obligation.   We do  not<br><br><br>                                          19\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          agree.    If  the  obligation  to  produce  an  unencumbered  12%<br><br>          ownership  interest was not essential  before and at  the time of<br><br>          the oral  contract    and,  as  we  have pointed  out,  there  is<br><br>          adequate evidence to support  a conclusion to that effect    then<br><br>          it does not matter  that the obligation took on  added importance<br><br>          as time went by and circumstances changed.<br><br>                     Dopp's other  arguments on  this issue do  not require<br><br>          comment.    For  the reasons  set  forth  herein,  we uphold  the<br><br>          district court's finding that  the obligation shirked by Pritzker<br><br>          lacked mutual essentiality.  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of<br><br>          resolution.<br><br>          III.  FULL DAMAGES\r          III.  FULL DAMAGES<br><br>                    Because  Dopp was  not legally entitled  to resolution,<br><br>          his contingent election of an alternative remedy   full damages  <br><br>          is both valid  and binding.   Withal, both  parties question  the<br><br>          amount of  the damage award.   To  answer these queries,  we must<br><br>          examine whether the district  court correctly instructed the jury<br><br>          as  to the  relevant measure of  damages and, if  so, whether the<br><br>          jury's resultant rendition of full damages passes muster.<br><br>                         A.

He contends<br><br>          that  the verdict on full damages undershot this target because a<br><br>          pinchpenny trial  court charged  the jury  in  too restrictive  a<br><br>          manner.

In  relevant part, the  judge told the<br><br>          jury:<br><br>                    First  you must  render a  verdict as  to the<br>                    amount of  the full damages to  which Dopp is<br>                    entitled  based on  Pritzker's breach  of the<br>                    oral contract.  . .  .  Full  damages reflect<br>                    the  amount, if  any,  that  is necessary  to<br>                    compensate Dopp in the event that he does not<br>                    elect  to have  the Court  enter an  order of<br>                    annulment.  They reflect the amount necessary<br>                    to put Dopp in as good a position as he would<br>                    have been if the oral contract had been fully<br>                    performed so  that his shares  were not being<br>                    encumbered by the SSA's  buy-out clause.  The<br>                    amount  of full  damages are  [sic] therefore<br>                    the difference between  the value of what  he<br>                    was promised  under  November 30,  1984  oral<br>                    contract  and the value  of what  he actually<br>                    received from Pritzker  under the December 3,<br>                    1984 stock subscription agreement.<br><br>          As we read these  words, we believe that the court  indicated, in<br><br>          essence,  that full  damages consisted  of the  monetary  cost of<br><br>          encumbrance, that is,  the value  of what Dopp  had a  legitimate<br><br>          right  to expect (a  12% interest in  HTP, not  encumbered in any<br><br>          unorthodox  way) less the value  of what he  actually received (a<br><br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               6Dopp  also  insists  that   in  addition  to  taking  other<br>          corrective action, we should annul the SSA.  He is barking up the<br>          wrong tree.   If Dopp  desired annulment, he  could have  elected<br>          that remedy below.  See Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 519.  He did  not do\r                              ___ _______<br>          so.  See Dopp III, 831 F. Supp. at 942.  Absent such an election,\r               ___ ________<br>          Dopp  cannot pursue  annulment on  appeal.

In  stark contrast, Dopp<br><br>          contends that the amount  is far too  scant, and that even  \"[i]f<br><br>          the  jury did  exactly that  which the  district court  stated it<br><br>          could  reasonably  do,\"  its  verdict  should  have been  in  the<br><br>          vicinity of $39,400,000.<br><br>                    Dopp's  contention  appears  to   be  no  more  than  a<br><br>          recasting  of his  complaints about  the  charge, see  supra Part\r                                                            ___  _____<br><br>          III(A),  and, at this point, the caterwauling may be rejected out<br><br>          of  hand.

At best, it seems that<br>          his  theory, which proposes  that full damages  should include at<br>          least the value of the  purchase agreement (fixed by the  jury in<br>          its  special findings  at $40,000,000),  might be viable  if Dopp<br>          proved  that  he  had the  capacity  to  close  the deal  without<br>          Pritzker's assistance.  But the record  wholly fails to establish<br>          that  fact.    Indeed,  Dopp  offered  no  such  proof,  and  all<br>          indications are that he  lacked the wherewithal to go  forward if<br>          Pritzker withheld his financial backing.<br><br>                                          24\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    Because  jurors exercise  great  leeway  in  evaluating<br><br>          claims and assessing  damages, appeals based on  verdict size are<br><br>          seldom successful.  When a disgruntled defendant complains that a<br><br>          jury award is overgenerous, the verdict ordinarily stands \"unless<br><br>          it is  grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking  to the conscience<br><br>          of the court, or so high that it would be a  denial of justice to<br><br>          permit it to stand.\"  Segal v.

This  figure  is  based  upon  an<br><br>          appraisal of the hotel empire conducted by the Merrill Lynch Real<br><br>          Estate  Advisory &amp;  Appraisal  Group (Merrill  Lynch),10 read  in<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               9On that  date, Dopp owned  an option to  acquire DBHC.   In<br>          entering the  oral contract, however,  Dopp in  effect agreed  to<br>          trade  that  asset for  a 20%  interest  in DBHC's  properties (a<br>          portion of which he would then cede to IRSA).  Thus, DBHC becomes<br>          the proper barometer for measuring value.<br><br>               10While Merrill Lynch issued its appraisal approximately one<br>          year after the transaction closed, the district court admitted it<br>          into evidence, and we think the jury could reasonably have relied<br>          on it.

In  turn, this value is  the value of<br><br>          the  asset   the purchase option    for the acquisition was to be<br><br>          structured in  such a  way as  to cost  Dopp nothing  (apart from<br><br>          cession of an  80% interest  in the acquired  properties).11   On<br><br>          this  basis,  then, a  rational  jury,  apportioning the  overall<br><br>          value, could have concluded  that Dopp's anticipated 12% interest<br><br>          in HTP was worth $14,286,600 on the date of the breach.<br><br>                    Once the  jurors determined  an asset value,  they next<br><br>          would have needed to determine what portion or percentage of that<br><br>          value constituted the cost  of encumbrance.  Taking the  evidence<br><br>          and  arguments advanced at trial most favorably to Dopp, we think<br><br>          that the  jury lawfully  could have determined  that the  buy-out<br><br>          option eliminated virtually all the  value of Dopp's 12% interest<br><br>          in  HTP, save  only  for  the  meagre  price  that  Pritzker  was<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               11Pritzker   argues   that  the   purchase   price  (roughly<br>          $40,500,000) must be deducted  from the value of DBHC  before the<br>          value of Dopp's pro rata interest is assayed because the purchase\r                          ___ ____<br>          price constituted an acquisition cost.  We can discern no logical<br>          basis for such  a deduction.  The  payment represented Pritzker's\r                                                                 __________<br>          acquisition cost   not  Dopp's.  Dopp  did not contribute to  it;<br>          instead, he  ceded 80% of the  equity in the  acquiring entity to<br>          Pritzker.   That was Dopp's \"acquisition cost\"    and it is fully<br>          accounted  for by limiting his  recovery to 12%  of DBHC's actual<br>          value    a  value that  did  not somehow  shrink because  HTP  or<br>          Pritzker tendered the purchase price.  Put another way, the value<br>          of DBHC remained more  or less the same regardless  of the amount<br>          expended for its acquisition.<br><br>                                          27\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          obligated to pay to redeem Dopp's shares.  We conclude that  this<br><br>          amount  should be the face value of  the buy-out option:  $50,000<br><br>          per share, or in the case  of Dopp's shares, $600,000.  Under the<br><br>          SSA,  Pritzker could have exercised the buy-out option as late as<br><br>          10  years after the  formation of  the contract  (withholding any<br><br>          payment until then).  There is evidence in the record, through an<br><br>          expert witness presented  by Pritzker,  that the  prospect of  so<br><br>          long a delay would justify a somewhat lower figure, reflective of<br><br>          a  time-related  discount.     The  expert  testified  that  this<br><br>          reduction to  present value could have brought  the present value<br><br>          of  the  redemption price  as  of  December 3,  1984,  as  low as<br><br>          $114,638.<br><br>              Thus, the jury could have found that, because of the wrongful<br><br>          encumbrance, Dopp lost an asset  worth $14,286,600, and, in  lieu<br><br>          thereof, was left with an asset  worth no more than $114,638.  On<br><br>          these  assumptions, a  verdict  for compensatory  damages in  the<br><br>          amount of $14,171,962 is adequately supported by the evidence.<br><br>                    Beyond  this amount, the  jury's award  is problematic.<br><br>          We  are unable  either  to explain  the excess  or  to locate  an<br><br>          evidentiary  hook on  which it might  be hung.   The  court below<br><br>          tried justifying the added damages in the following manner:<br><br>                    In calculating the loss  suffered by Dopp . .<br>                    .,  the  jury  need  not  have  limited   its<br>                    consideration  to the actual  value of Dopp's<br>                    unencumbered shares in HTP  as of the date of<br>                    the breach  of the  Oral Contract.

See  Dopp III,  831 F. Supp.  at 951.   We think it  is\r                    ___  ________<br><br>          evident from this account  that the district court lost  its way.<br><br>          In the pages that follow, we set forth our rationale.<br><br>                    Perhaps most important, there is no sign that the court<br><br>          factored into the decisional  calculus the overall nature  of the<br><br>          litigation,  or  that it  placed  Pritzker's  conduct within  the<br><br><br>                                          37\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          context of the case  as a whole.  Prosopopoeially  speaking, each<br><br>          case, like each individual, has  a personality distinct from that<br><br>          of all others.   A case's personality is important  in evaluating<br><br>          claims  of obstinacy because, just  as obstinacy may  be found to<br><br>          characterize  a party's conduct at one stage of a particular case<br><br>          but not  necessarily at another, see Carrillo v. Sameit Westbulk,\r                                           ___ ________    _______________<br><br>          514  F.2d  1214, 1220  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 423  U.S. 1014\r                                              _____  ______<br><br>          (1975),  so may obstinacy  be found to  characterize a particular<br><br>          form of  conduct in  one case but  not in another.   In  making a<br><br>          determination of obstinacy under P.R.R. Civ. P. 44, therefore, it<br><br>          is  wise  for  the   trier  to  take  into  account   the  case's<br><br>          personality.16   This  course becomes  imperative when  the court<br><br>          is  confronted  with   a  case  that  has  a  highly  distinctive<br><br>          personality.<br><br>                    This is such a  case.  The district court  described it<br><br>          as involving \"difficult and protracted legal battles.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                  ________<br><br>          831  F. Supp. at  940.  This  understates the matter.   Here, the<br><br>          stakes are high, the  issues tangled, the law tenebrous,  and the<br><br>          litigants relentless.   The nature of the  performance sought and<br><br>          the  multiplicity  of parties  and  interests  contribute to  the<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               16Our own precedents afford a testament to the importance of<br>          correctly  characterizing the  nature of  the litigation  for the<br>          purpose of discerning  obstinacy.   In La Playa  Santa Marina,  a\r                                                 ______________________<br>          dealer  sued  a  manufacturer.    Following  a bench  trial,  the<br>          district  court found  the manufacturer  liable for  damages, 597<br>          F.2d at 3-4, and, in addition, awarded attorneys' fees due to the<br>          manufacturer's \"obvious  temerity in  the defense of  this suit.\"<br>          Id.  at  7.    We reversed  the  fee  award,  observing  that the\r          ___<br>          underlying dispute was one  characterized by \"close questions and<br>          sharp conflicts in  the evidence on both liability  and damages.\"<br>          Id.\r          ___<br><br>                                          38\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          case's  uniqueness.  In  view of these  realities, we are  of the<br><br>          opinion that  the trial  court had  an inescapable  obligation to<br><br>          gauge  the culpability  of  Pritzker's conduct  accordingly.   In<br><br>          failing  to  undertake such  an  evaluation,  the district  court<br><br>          abused its discretion.<br><br>                    We  believe that  the  court compounded  this error  of<br><br>          omission by slipping into  various errors of commission.   In the<br><br>          first  place,  the  court  used  too  wide  a  temporal  horizon.<br><br>          Obstinacy  depends  on  a  party's   conduct  in  the  course  of\r                                                        ___________________<br><br>          litigation.     See,  e.g.,  De  Leon  Lopez,  931  F.2d  at  126\r          __________      ___   ____   _______________<br><br>          (indicating that the rules  prohibit obstinacy \"during the course<br><br>          of  a lawsuit\").  Thus,  the fact that  Pritzker practiced deceit<br><br>          and  duress during the events  antecedent to the litigation could<br><br>          not trigger Rule 44.<br><br>                    In the second  place, we  do not believe  that, in  the<br><br>          circumstances  of this  case,  Pritzker's appeal  from the  first<br><br>          jury's verdict constituted  sanctionable conduct.   The  district<br><br>          court  thought that it was proper to penalize Pritzker for taking<br><br>          the appeal  because he \"thereby  caus[ed] significant  additional<br><br>          expenditures by the  plaintiff, only  to have the  amount of  the<br><br>          verdict  against him increased by the second verdict.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                  ________<br><br>          831  F.

We  find such a conclusion indefensible in<br><br>          light  of the appeals  simultaneously taken  by Dopp  and several<br><br>          other  parties  from  the  first  jury  verdict;  the  fact  that<br><br>          Pritzker's appeal succeeded  at least  in part,  prompting us  to<br><br>          erase the original  remedial scheme  and to order  a partial  new<br><br><br>                                          39\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          trial;  and,   finally,  the  uncertainty  and   complexity  that<br><br>          surrounded the issue of Dopp's entitlement vel non to resolution.\r                                                     ___ ___<br><br>                    This last point is especially significant because, as a<br><br>          general  rule, litigation of a  novel but colorable claim cannot,<br><br>          by itself, provide  the basis  for a finding  of obstinacy  under<br><br>          P.R.R.

He secured the option<br><br>          with a $2,000,000  letter of credit supplied  with the assistance<br><br>          of Island Resorts,  S.A. (IRSA), a  Panamanian corporation.   The<br><br>          option agreement specified that the  underlying purchase-and-sale<br><br>          transaction would be consummated no later than December 3, 1984.<br><br>                    Though playing for high stakes, Dopp had relatively few<br><br>          chips of  his own.   Thus, he  immediately set out  in search  of<br><br>          financial backing.  He encountered heavy seas.  With time running<br><br>          out,  Dopp turned  to  Pritzker.   The  parties reached  an  oral<br><br>          agreement on November 30, 1984.  Under its terms, Pritzker agreed<br><br><br>                                          5\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          to  provide the funds needed  to seal the  purchase and reimburse<br><br>          Dopp's  and IRSA's costs.  In exchange, Dopp agreed that Pritzker<br><br>          would  receive an 80% equity  interest in a  holding company that<br><br>          would be formed  to acquire  DBHC's stock, and,  as a  sweetener,<br><br>          that  a Pritzker affiliate would be given a long-term contract to<br><br>          manage the hotels coincident with the closing.<br><br>                    The parties  formed HTP  Corporation (HTP) to  serve as<br><br>          the holding company.   Dopp controlled 20% of HTP's  stock in the<br><br>          first  instance, but ceded some shares to IRSA in accordance with<br><br>          a prior arrangement.  In the end, Dopp retained a 12% interest in<br><br>          HTP.    Meanwhile,  Pritzker,  through a  nominee,  held  an  80%<br><br>          interest.2<br><br>                    On December 3,  1984, Pritzker presented  two documents<br><br>          to Dopp that supposedly embodied their oral  agreement.  Pritzker<br><br>          injected  into one  of these  documents   the  stock subscription<br><br>          agreement  (SSA)    a  clause granting  the majority  shareholder<br><br>          (Pritzker) an option to retire the stock held by the two minority<br><br>          shareholders (Dopp and IRSA) for $50,000 per share, or $1,000,000<br><br>          in the aggregate, at any time within 10 years.  With the purchase<br><br>          option due  to expire, the move put  Dopp at a huge disadvantage.<br><br>          He signed the documents.<br><br>                    After HTP obtained a one-day extension from the seller,<br><br>          it  closed the underlying transaction  on December 4,  1984.  HTP<br><br>          bought  DBHC's stock  for  $36,846,000, net  of adjustments;  the<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               2For  ease in  reference,  we ignore  the  nominee, a  shell<br>          corporation, and  treat  Pritzker as  if  he, himself,  were  the<br>          majority shareholder.<br><br>                                          6\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          seller canceled  the letter  of credit; Pritzker  reimbursed Dopp<br><br>          and IRSA  for expenses advanced  ($710,000); and Dopp  received a<br><br>          prearranged $200,000 \"consulting fee.\"<br><br>                                 B.

He<br><br>          alleged,   inter  alia,  that  the  buy-out  option  in  the  SSA\r                     _____  ____<br><br>          contravened  the oral contract, and  that his consent  to the SSA<br><br>          had been unfairly procured.  After  a 10-day trial, a jury  found<br><br>          in  Dopp's favor, determining that the parties had formed an oral<br><br>          contract on November 30, 1984, and that, thereafter, Pritzker had<br><br>          employed deceit and duress to pressure Dopp into signing the SSA,<br><br>          thereby   violating  the   oral   contract.     Based  on   these<br><br>          determinations,  the jury  awarded  Dopp  $2,000,000 in  damages.<br><br>          Thereafter,  the district  court,  acting in  response to  Dopp's<br><br>          motion under  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 59(e), declared  the SSA  null and<br><br>          void in  respect to Dopp's shares  in HTP, but  declined to order<br><br>          resolution of the oral contract.3<br><br>                    The  first trial  produced no  fewer than  ten appeals.<br><br>          After considering them, we upheld the liability determination but<br><br>          vacated  both the damage award  and the district court's remedial<br><br>          rulings, see  Dopp II, 947  F.2d at  520.

We  believe that  this  assessment of<br><br>          Dopp's  actual expectation is  supportable, and that  it alone is<br><br>          sufficient  to ground  a principled  conclusion that  the parties<br><br>          regarded the element of  non-encumbrance as an incidental, rather<br><br>          than  an essential, obligation of their  contract.  If it is true<br><br>          that  Dopp, prior  and  pursuant to  the  formation of  the  oral<br><br>          contract,  \"fully expected  that there  would be  some reasonable<br><br>          option\"   as  he, himself, testified    and yet proceeded  to the<br><br>          written contract phase without settling this matter precisely, it<br><br>          seems eminently reasonable  for a factfinder to conclude that the<br><br>          element of non-encumbrance could not have been  the raison d'etre\r                                                              _____________<br><br>          of the oral contract.<br><br>                    What is more, the plausibility of this conclusion rests<br><br>          not  only on  Dopp's  own words,  but  also on  other  witnesses'<br><br><br>                                          18\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          testimony  to the  effect that, when  ownership is  closely held,<br><br>          buy-out  options  are  a  regular  attribute  of  intra-corporate<br><br>          arrangements.   For our  part, we regard  this truth  to be self-<br><br>          evident; indeed, it is difficult to imagine an 80% shareholder of<br><br>          a close  corporation owning  extremely valuable assets  who would<br><br>          not  routinely demand  such protection.   Pritzker may  have been<br><br>          many things,  but, as Dopp well  knew, he was  neither a neophyte<br><br>          nor  an altruist.

Here,<br><br>          Pritzker's breach did not  render the contract inherently infirm.<br><br>          To  be sure, the breach harmed Dopp, but his insistent focus upon<br><br>          the harm begs the real question.  The critical determinant of the<br><br>          availability  of a resultory remedy  is neither the  fact nor the<br><br>          magnitude  of  the inflicted  injury,  but,  rather, whether  the<br><br>          defaulting  party's breach irretrievably undermined the contract.<br><br>          In  this instance,  the district  court thought  not; and  we can<br><br>          scarcely  conclude, based  on  the evidence  presented, that  its<br><br>          decision was clearly erroneous.<br><br>                    In a last-ditch effort to  turn the tide, Dopp  insists<br><br>          that the  unreasonableness of the particular  buy-out clause that<br><br>          Pritzker   inserted  into  the   SSA  somehow  transmogrifies  an<br><br>          accessory obligation  into an  essential obligation.   We do  not<br><br><br>                                          19\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          agree.    If  the  obligation  to  produce  an  unencumbered  12%<br><br>          ownership  interest was not essential  before and at  the time of<br><br>          the oral  contract    and,  as  we  have pointed  out,  there  is<br><br>          adequate evidence to support  a conclusion to that effect    then<br><br>          it does not matter  that the obligation took on  added importance<br><br>          as time went by and circumstances changed.<br><br>                     Dopp's other  arguments on  this issue do  not require<br><br>          comment.    For  the reasons  set  forth  herein,  we uphold  the<br><br>          district court's finding that  the obligation shirked by Pritzker<br><br>          lacked mutual essentiality.  Accordingly, we affirm the denial of<br><br>          resolution.<br><br>          III.  FULL DAMAGES\r          III.  FULL DAMAGES<br><br>                    Because  Dopp was  not legally entitled  to resolution,<br><br>          his contingent election of an alternative remedy   full damages  <br><br>          is both valid  and binding.   Withal, both  parties question  the<br><br>          amount of  the damage award.   To  answer these queries,  we must<br><br>          examine whether the district  court correctly instructed the jury<br><br>          as  to the  relevant measure of  damages and, if  so, whether the<br><br>          jury's resultant rendition of full damages passes muster.<br><br>                         A.

The Trial Court's Instructions.\r                             ______________________________<br><br>                    Under  Dopp's rather  imaginative theory  of  the case,<br><br>          full damages, properly computed,  total $60,581,000.  He contends<br><br>          that  the verdict on full damages undershot this target because a<br><br>          pinchpenny trial  court charged  the jury  in  too restrictive  a<br><br>          manner.   Branding  those  instructions as  contradictory to  the<br><br>          teachings  of Dopp II and characterizing them as \"poorly thought-\r                        _______<br><br><br>                                          20\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          out and convoluted,\" Dopp  asks us to  set aside the verdict  and<br><br>          mandate further  proceedings.6   We conclude  that the  court did<br><br>          not commit reversible error in framing its jury instructions.<br><br>                    Our analysis begins, as  it must, with the text  of the<br><br>          district  court's charge.  In  relevant part, the  judge told the<br><br>          jury:<br><br>                    First  you must  render a  verdict as  to the<br>                    amount of  the full damages to  which Dopp is<br>                    entitled  based on  Pritzker's breach  of the<br>                    oral contract.  . .  .  Full  damages reflect<br>                    the  amount, if  any,  that  is necessary  to<br>                    compensate Dopp in the event that he does not<br>                    elect  to have  the Court  enter an  order of<br>                    annulment.  They reflect the amount necessary<br>                    to put Dopp in as good a position as he would<br>                    have been if the oral contract had been fully<br>                    performed so  that his shares  were not being<br>                    encumbered by the SSA's  buy-out clause.  The<br>                    amount  of full  damages are  [sic] therefore<br>                    the difference between  the value of what  he<br>                    was promised  under  November 30,  1984  oral<br>                    contract  and the value  of what  he actually<br>                    received from Pritzker  under the December 3,<br>                    1984 stock subscription agreement.<br><br>          As we read these  words, we believe that the court  indicated, in<br><br>          essence,  that full  damages consisted  of the  monetary  cost of<br><br>          encumbrance, that is,  the value  of what Dopp  had a  legitimate<br><br>          right  to expect (a  12% interest in  HTP, not  encumbered in any<br><br>          unorthodox  way) less the value  of what he  actually received (a<br><br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               6Dopp  also  insists  that   in  addition  to  taking  other<br>          corrective action, we should annul the SSA.  He is barking up the<br>          wrong tree.   If Dopp  desired annulment, he  could have  elected<br>          that remedy below.  See Dopp II, 947 F.2d at 519.  He did  not do\r                              ___ _______<br>          so.  See Dopp III, 831 F. Supp. at 942.  Absent such an election,\r               ___ ________<br>          Dopp  cannot pursue  annulment on  appeal.   Nor is  this outcome<br>          unconscionable; as  a general legal principle,  \"[p]arties cannot<br>          have their cake and eat  it, too.\"  United States v.

In support of this theorem, Dopp<br><br>          directs our attention  to certain language contained in  Dopp II,\r                                                                   _______<br><br>          to article 1255 of the Civil Code, P.R.

Pritzker, for  his  part, is  satisfied  with the<br><br>          court's  instructions but  not with  the amount  of damages.   He<br><br>          argues that the verdict  is not rationally based on  the evidence<br><br>          presented and,  hence, that the district court  erred in refusing<br><br>          to  grant his motion  for a new  trial.  In  stark contrast, Dopp<br><br>          contends that the amount  is far too  scant, and that even  \"[i]f<br><br>          the  jury did  exactly that  which the  district court  stated it<br><br>          could  reasonably  do,\"  its  verdict  should  have been  in  the<br><br>          vicinity of $39,400,000.<br><br>                    Dopp's  contention  appears  to   be  no  more  than  a<br><br>          recasting  of his  complaints about  the  charge, see  supra Part\r                                                            ___  _____<br><br>          III(A),  and, at this point, the caterwauling may be rejected out<br><br>          of  hand.

At best, it seems that<br>          his  theory, which proposes  that full damages  should include at<br>          least the value of the  purchase agreement (fixed by the  jury in<br>          its  special findings  at $40,000,000),  might be viable  if Dopp<br>          proved  that  he  had the  capacity  to  close  the deal  without<br>          Pritzker's assistance.  But the record  wholly fails to establish<br>          that  fact.    Indeed,  Dopp  offered  no  such  proof,  and  all<br>          indications are that he  lacked the wherewithal to go  forward if<br>          Pritzker withheld his financial backing.<br><br>                                          24\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>                    Because  jurors exercise  great  leeway  in  evaluating<br><br>          claims and assessing  damages, appeals based on  verdict size are<br><br>          seldom successful.  When a disgruntled defendant complains that a<br><br>          jury award is overgenerous, the verdict ordinarily stands \"unless<br><br>          it is  grossly excessive, inordinate, shocking  to the conscience<br><br>          of the court, or so high that it would be a  denial of justice to<br><br>          permit it to stand.\"  Segal v.

In  turn, this value is  the value of<br><br>          the  asset   the purchase option    for the acquisition was to be<br><br>          structured in  such a  way as  to cost  Dopp nothing  (apart from<br><br>          cession of an  80% interest  in the acquired  properties).11   On<br><br>          this  basis,  then, a  rational  jury,  apportioning the  overall<br><br>          value, could have concluded  that Dopp's anticipated 12% interest<br><br>          in HTP was worth $14,286,600 on the date of the breach.<br><br>                    Once the  jurors determined  an asset value,  they next<br><br>          would have needed to determine what portion or percentage of that<br><br>          value constituted the cost  of encumbrance.  Taking the  evidence<br><br>          and  arguments advanced at trial most favorably to Dopp, we think<br><br>          that the  jury lawfully  could have determined  that the  buy-out<br><br>          option eliminated virtually all the  value of Dopp's 12% interest<br><br>          in  HTP, save  only  for  the  meagre  price  that  Pritzker  was<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               11Pritzker   argues   that  the   purchase   price  (roughly<br>          $40,500,000) must be deducted  from the value of DBHC  before the<br>          value of Dopp's pro rata interest is assayed because the purchase\r                          ___ ____<br>          price constituted an acquisition cost.  We can discern no logical<br>          basis for such  a deduction.  The  payment represented Pritzker's\r                                                                 __________<br>          acquisition cost   not  Dopp's.  Dopp  did not contribute to  it;<br>          instead, he  ceded 80% of the  equity in the  acquiring entity to<br>          Pritzker.   That was Dopp's \"acquisition cost\"    and it is fully<br>          accounted  for by limiting his  recovery to 12%  of DBHC's actual<br>          value    a  value that  did  not somehow  shrink because  HTP  or<br>          Pritzker tendered the purchase price.  Put another way, the value<br>          of DBHC remained more  or less the same regardless  of the amount<br>          expended for its acquisition.<br><br>                                          27\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          obligated to pay to redeem Dopp's shares.  We conclude that  this<br><br>          amount  should be the face value of  the buy-out option:  $50,000<br><br>          per share, or in the case  of Dopp's shares, $600,000.  Under the<br><br>          SSA,  Pritzker could have exercised the buy-out option as late as<br><br>          10  years after the  formation of  the contract  (withholding any<br><br>          payment until then).  There is evidence in the record, through an<br><br>          expert witness presented  by Pritzker,  that the  prospect of  so<br><br>          long a delay would justify a somewhat lower figure, reflective of<br><br>          a  time-related  discount.     The  expert  testified  that  this<br><br>          reduction to  present value could have brought  the present value<br><br>          of  the  redemption price  as  of  December 3,  1984,  as  low as<br><br>          $114,638.<br><br>              Thus, the jury could have found that, because of the wrongful<br><br>          encumbrance, Dopp lost an asset  worth $14,286,600, and, in  lieu<br><br>          thereof, was left with an asset  worth no more than $114,638.  On<br><br>          these  assumptions, a  verdict  for compensatory  damages in  the<br><br>          amount of $14,171,962 is adequately supported by the evidence.<br><br>                    Beyond  this amount, the  jury's award  is problematic.<br><br>          We  are unable  either  to explain  the excess  or  to locate  an<br><br>          evidentiary  hook on  which it might  be hung.   The  court below<br><br>          tried justifying the added damages in the following manner:<br><br>                    In calculating the loss  suffered by Dopp . .<br>                    .,  the  jury  need  not  have  limited   its<br>                    consideration  to the actual  value of Dopp's<br>                    unencumbered shares in HTP  as of the date of<br>                    the breach  of the  Oral Contract.

A case's personality is important  in evaluating<br><br>          claims  of obstinacy because, just  as obstinacy may  be found to<br><br>          characterize  a party's conduct at one stage of a particular case<br><br>          but not  necessarily at another, see Carrillo v.

In  making a<br><br>          determination of obstinacy under P.R.R. Civ. P. 44, therefore, it<br><br>          is  wise  for  the   trier  to  take  into  account   the  case's<br><br>          personality.16   This  course becomes  imperative when  the court<br><br>          is  confronted  with   a  case  that  has  a  highly  distinctive<br><br>          personality.<br><br>                    This is such a  case.  The district court  described it<br><br>          as involving \"difficult and protracted legal battles.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                  ________<br><br>          831  F.

The nature of the  performance sought and<br><br>          the  multiplicity  of parties  and  interests  contribute to  the<br>                              \r          ____________________<br><br>               16Our own precedents afford a testament to the importance of<br>          correctly  characterizing the  nature of  the litigation  for the<br>          purpose of discerning  obstinacy.   In La Playa  Santa Marina,  a\r                                                 ______________________<br>          dealer  sued  a  manufacturer.    Following  a bench  trial,  the<br>          district  court found  the manufacturer  liable for  damages, 597<br>          F.2d at 3-4, and, in addition, awarded attorneys' fees due to the<br>          manufacturer's \"obvious  temerity in  the defense of  this suit.\"<br>          Id.  at  7.    We reversed  the  fee  award,  observing  that the\r          ___<br>          underlying dispute was one  characterized by \"close questions and<br>          sharp conflicts in  the evidence on both liability  and damages.\"<br>          Id.\r          ___<br><br>                                          38\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          case's  uniqueness.  In  view of these  realities, we are  of the<br><br>          opinion that  the trial  court had  an inescapable  obligation to<br><br>          gauge  the culpability  of  Pritzker's conduct  accordingly.   In<br><br>          failing  to  undertake such  an  evaluation,  the district  court<br><br>          abused its discretion.<br><br>                    We  believe that  the  court compounded  this error  of<br><br>          omission by slipping into  various errors of commission.   In the<br><br>          first  place,  the  court  used  too  wide  a  temporal  horizon.<br><br>          Obstinacy  depends  on  a  party's   conduct  in  the  course  of\r                                                        ___________________<br><br>          litigation.     See,  e.g.,  De  Leon  Lopez,  931  F.2d  at  126\r          __________      ___   ____   _______________<br><br>          (indicating that the rules  prohibit obstinacy \"during the course<br><br>          of  a lawsuit\").  Thus,  the fact that  Pritzker practiced deceit<br><br>          and  duress during the events  antecedent to the litigation could<br><br>          not trigger Rule 44.<br><br>                    In the second  place, we  do not believe  that, in  the<br><br>          circumstances  of this  case,  Pritzker's appeal  from the  first<br><br>          jury's verdict constituted  sanctionable conduct.   The  district<br><br>          court  thought that it was proper to penalize Pritzker for taking<br><br>          the appeal  because he \"thereby  caus[ed] significant  additional<br><br>          expenditures by the  plaintiff, only  to have the  amount of  the<br><br>          verdict  against him increased by the second verdict.\"  Dopp III,\r                                                                  ________<br><br>          831  F.

We  find such a conclusion indefensible in<br><br>          light  of the appeals  simultaneously taken  by Dopp  and several<br><br>          other  parties  from  the  first  jury  verdict;  the  fact  that<br><br>          Pritzker's appeal succeeded  at least  in part,  prompting us  to<br><br>          erase the original  remedial scheme  and to order  a partial  new<br><br><br>                                          39\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>\r\r<br><br><br><br><br><br>          trial;  and,   finally,  the  uncertainty  and   complexity  that<br><br>          surrounded the issue of Dopp's entitlement vel non to resolution.\r                                                     ___ ___<br><br>                    This last point is especially significant because, as a<br><br>          general  rule, litigation of a  novel but colorable claim cannot,<br><br>          by itself, provide  the basis  for a finding  of obstinacy  under<br><br>          P.R.R.
