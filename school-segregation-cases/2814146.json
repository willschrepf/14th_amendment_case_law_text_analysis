P., Appellant\n\n                                                  v.\n\n                Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, Appellee\n\n\n          FROM THE COUNTY COURT AT LAW NO. 4 OF WILLIAMSON COUNTY\n           NO. 11-2797-FC4, HONORABLE JOHN McMASTER, JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n                             MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n\n               M.F.P. challenges the trial court’s decree terminating his parental rights to S.P.,\n\ncontending by his sole issue on appeal that factually insufficient evidence supports the trial court’s\n\nfinding that termination is in the child’s best interest. We will affirm the judgment.\n\n\n                                            Background\n\n               S.P. was born in 1998, the oldest of five children born to the same mother. S.P. is\n\nthe only one of these children alleged to be appellant’s child. Appellant’s attorney asserted that\n\nappellant has three other children. Appellant has never met the child subject of this suit because\n\nhe did not believe the mother when she said she was pregnant with his child—he called her a\n\n“pathological liar.” Since paternity testing prompted by this case proved him to be the child’s father,\n\nappellant has exchanged letters with the child and spoken with him on the telephone. Appellant also\n\nprovided as much as $100 in child support. At the time of the February 2013 trial, appellant had\n\fbeen incarcerated for six-and-a-half years awaiting trial on racketeering charges. He was confined\n\nto a segregation unit in the California detention center because of fighting while incarcerated.\n\n               The child lived with his maternal grandmother, his maternal uncle, and his siblings\n\nfor much of his life even while in the primary care of the child’s mother. The Department intended\n\nthat his grandmother adopt S.P. along with his siblings. Adoption of this child would entitle his\n\ngrandmother to a $400 per month subsidy.\n\n               Before this trial, the trial court terminated all other parental rights to the child and his\n\nsiblings. Though there was minimal reference to the conditions prompting this suit, the termination\n\norder reveals that the court found that the children’s mother and the other children’s father had\n\nknowingly placed or knowingly allowed the children to remain in conditions or surroundings that\n\nendangered the children’s physical or emotional well-being, engaged in conduct or knowingly placed\n\nthe children with persons who engaged in conduct that endangered the children’s emotional or\n\nphysical well-being, constructively abandoned the children, failed to comply with services, and used\n\ncontrolled substances in a way that endangered the children and violated other restrictions.\n\n               The trial court found that appellant had engaged in conduct or knowingly placed the\n\nchildren with persons who engaged in conduct that endangered the child’s physical or emotional\n\nwell-being. The court also found that termination of appellant’s parental rights was in the child’s\n\nbest interest. Appellant challenges only the best-interest finding on appeal.\n\n\n                                  Standards of proof and review\n\n               Clear and convincing evidence must support the decision to terminate parental rights,\n\nincluding the best-interest finding. Tex. Fam. Code § 161.001(2); In re J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d 256,\n\n                                                   2\n\f263-64 (Tex. 2002). Courts consider many factors in assessing the child’s best interest, including\n\nthe nine factors listed in Holley v. Adams, 544 S.W.2d 367, 371-72 (Tex. 1976) (factors include\n\n(1) the child’s desires, (2) current and future physical and emotional needs of child, (3) current and\n\nfuture physical danger to the child, (4) parental abilities of person seeking custody, (5) whether\n\nprograms are available to assist person seeking custody in promoting best interests of child, (6) plans\n\nfor child by person seeking custody, (7) stability of home, (8) acts or omissions of parent that may\n\nindicate parent-child relationship is not proper, and (9) any excuse for acts or omissions of parent).\n\n               Termination proceedings are strictly scrutinized on appeal. See Holick v. Smith,\n\n685 S.W.2d 18, 20 (Tex. 1985). With respect to our review of the factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, we consider the entire record, including disputed evidence, to determine “whether\n\nthe evidence is such that a factfinder could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction about the\n\ntruth of the State’s allegations.” J.F.C., 96 S.W.3d at 266; In re C.H., 89 S.W.3d 17, 25 (Tex. 2002).\n\n“If, in light of the entire record, the disputed evidence that a reasonable fact finder could not\n\nhave credited in favor of the finding is so significant that a factfinder could not reasonably\n\nhave formed a firm belief or conviction, then the evidence is factually insufficient.” In re J.F.C.,\n\n96 S.W.3d at 266.\n\n\n                                           The testimony\n\n               Because much of the testimony is relevant to more than one Holley factor regarding\n\nthe child’s best interest, we will review the testimony as a whole. The witnesses at trial included\n\nthe child’s maternal grandmother, maternal uncle, and caseworker. These witnesses recounted their\n\nobservations as well as some contact with the child’s father.\n\n                                                  3\n\f                Although the child did not testify, the witnesses all testified that he wanted to stay\n\nwith his grandmother, uncle, and siblings.1 The child wanted to retain contact with his father and\n\nwrote in a letter to appellant that he loved and missed appellant, but the child told his caseworker\n\nthat he did not want his father to have any power to make decisions for him. Appellant wanted the\n\nchild to stay in his current placement, but wanted to retain his rights to ensure continued contact\n\nwith the child. The child’s maternal grandmother testified that, although she preferred that the child\n\nhave no contact with his father because the child got “confused” a lot, she would permit continued\n\nappropriate contact. The child’s uncle testified that he would permit continued contact as long as\n\nthe child desired regardless of whether the court terminated the legal parent-child relationship.\n\n                The grandmother was approved to adopt the child, but the uncle was not. The\n\nchild was doing fine in her care despite some developmental/academic deficiencies that were\n\n\n        1\n            In his reply brief, appellant complains that this decree must be reversed because of the\nabsence of testimony from the child. He contends this testimony is necessary to the best-interest\ndetermination. He relies on a provision that the “child shall attend each permanency hearing unless\nthe court specifically excuses the child's attendance.” See Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302. The parties\ndiscussed the issue before the termination hearing began and expressed their agreement to\npermit hearsay statements regarding what the child had said about his wishes to the witnesses. The\nDepartment’s attorney said, “as long as we are [in agreement] that this is what he has told the parties,\nthis is what his wishes have been stated, that we would rather keep him out of the courtroom and\nkeep him in school if it’s okay.” Appellant’s attorney said, “ I did agree that whatever the child has\nsaid, basically, I don’t see the need to put the child through it.” The trial court stated that he would\nprefer to avoid pulling the child out of school “unless there is a profound reason to do that because\nit is really disruptive.” The court plainly chose not to require the child’s attendance based on the\nchild’s interests and the agreement of the parties. There is no showing that the parties who testified\nabout the child’s wishes misrepresented the child’s wishes. Finally, to the extent that the statute\nconcerning attendance at permanency hearings applies to this termination hearing, it plainly states\nthat “[f]ailure by the child to attend a hearing does not affect the validity of an order rendered at the\nhearing.” Tex. Fam. Code § 263.302. On this record, the trial court did not err by not requiring the\nchild to attend and testify regarding his wishes.\n\n\n                                                   4\n\fattributed to his absences from school in previous years. The grandmother had stopped working\n\nto take care of the children. The child’s uncle socialized with the child and he attempted to\n\nestablish consequences for unsatisfactory academic performance. While the uncle was unemployed\n\nfor several months, he took the children to appointments because he could speak English better\n\nthan the grandmother. A caseworker once found the uncle asleep on the couch in the afternoon\n\nwhile in charge of the children. He was about to start a new job maintaining an apartment complex.\n\nThe grandmother, uncle, and children had moved three times in the eighteen months this case\n\nwas pending—once being evicted for nonpayment of rent—and were contemplating a move to\n\ntheir previous homes in Seattle or California. Termination and adoption would improve the\n\ngrandmother’s monetary position by adding a $400 monthly stipend to the approximately $1,440 she\n\nreceived in social security payments and food stamps. There was no testimony regarding whether\n\nadoption of the other siblings would bring a similar per-child stipend.\n\n               Appellant’s incarceration for an uncertain term prevents him from personally\n\nproviding care for the child. He sent “maybe $100” to assist with the child’s care after learning that\n\nhe was the father. He had taken a parenting class in prison before knowing about this child as a\n\nmeans of getting out of his cell. He had fathered three other children but was not the primary\n\ncaregiver to any of them. Although his attorney described appellant’s parents and siblings as “quite\n\ndecent” and employed, the caseworker did not inquire about their interest in adopting the children.\n\nThere is no evidence that any of appellant’s relatives have offered to care for or support the child.\n\nAccording to the maternal grandmother, they have not sent any financial support. There was no\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fspeculation regarding when appellant might be released or what sort of financial, emotional, or\n\nphysical support appellant or his relatives could provide either before or after his release.\n\n\n                                              Conclusion\n\n               We conclude that factually sufficient evidence was presented at trial on which the\n\ntrial court could reasonably have formed a firm belief or conviction that termination of appellant’s\n\nparental rights was in S.P.’s best interest. Finding no reversible error presented, we affirm the\n\ntermination of appellant’s parental rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                               Jeff Rose, Justice\n\nBefore Justices Puryear, Pemberton, and Rose\n\nAffirmed\n\nFiled: June 26, 2013\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f",
