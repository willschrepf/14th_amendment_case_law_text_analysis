See id. §§ 38.003, .004(1). Taking judicial notice of\n                these two things is legally sufficient to support a determination that the\n                attorney's fees award was reasonable. Gill Sav.

First National Bank of Livingston, Texas, 809 S.W.2d 362, 238 (Tex.App.-\n\nBeaumont 1991, no pet.), the Court was presented with a situation similar to that which occurred\n\nherein. In Lacy, there was evidence presented of the amount of attorneys’ fees, but objection was\n\nmade when testimony was presented concerning attorneys’ fees on the basis that no expert had been\n\ndesignated. There, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court is presumed to have taken judicial\n\nnotice of the reasonable and customary attorneys’ fee and the contents of the file, and that such\n\njudicial notice in and of itself is sufficient to support an award of attorneys’ fees.5\n\n                                                   II.\n\n             SANDERS’ CLAIM WAS PRESENTED UNDER §38.001 OF THE\n                 TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE\n\n        There is a conflict among the Texas Courts of Appeals concerning whether or not the judicial\n\nnotice provisions discussed above apply to cases outside of §38.001 of the Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code. One court has summarized the conflicting cases as follows:\n\n                Section 38.004 does not allow courts to take judicial notice of reasonableness; rather,\n                it allows a court to take judicial notice of \"the usual and customary attorney's fee\" in\n                a bench trial. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.004. Because section\n                38.003 is limited to claims described in section 38.001, and because section 38.004\n                does not speak to judicial notice of reasonableness, this court has held that trial courts\n\n\n        4\n            A copy of the decision in Cox v.

In Lacy, there was evidence presented of the amount of attorneys’ fees, but objection was\n\nmade when testimony was presented concerning attorneys’ fees on the basis that no expert had been\n\ndesignated. There, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court is presumed to have taken judicial\n\nnotice of the reasonable and customary attorneys’ fee and the contents of the file, and that such\n\njudicial notice in and of itself is sufficient to support an award of attorneys’ fees.5\n\n                                                   II.\n\n             SANDERS’ CLAIM WAS PRESENTED UNDER §38.001 OF THE\n                 TEXAS CIVIL PRACTICE AND REMEDIES CODE\n\n        There is a conflict among the Texas Courts of Appeals concerning whether or not the judicial\n\nnotice provisions discussed above apply to cases outside of §38.001 of the Civil Practice and\n\nRemedies Code. One court has summarized the conflicting cases as follows:\n\n                Section 38.004 does not allow courts to take judicial notice of reasonableness; rather,\n                it allows a court to take judicial notice of \"the usual and customary attorney's fee\" in\n                a bench trial. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.004. Because section\n                38.003 is limited to claims described in section 38.001, and because section 38.004\n                does not speak to judicial notice of reasonableness, this court has held that trial courts\n\n\n        4\n            A copy of the decision in Cox v.
