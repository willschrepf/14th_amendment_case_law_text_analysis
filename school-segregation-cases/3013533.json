Discerning no material infirmities in the court’s legal\nconclusions and no clear error in its findings of fact, we affirm the judgment.\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.     Factual Background 1\n       The Ascension Parish School District (“the District”) operates four high\nschools in southeast Louisiana—Donaldsonville High School on the west bank\nof the Mississippi River, and East Ascension High School, Dutchtown High\nSchool, 2 and St. Amant High School on the east bank. Since at least 1972, the\nDistrict has assigned students to these schools through an attendance-zone-\nbased “feeder plan,” whereby specified elementary schools “feed” into specified\nmiddle schools, which in turn “feed” into one of the high schools. This\norganization allows students to matriculate together to middle school and high\nschool.\n       In 2004, a federal district court dismissed the District’s longstanding\ndesegregation case and declared the District unitary after finding that all\nvestiges of the prior compulsory dual school system had been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.\n       Later that year, in response to dramatic population growth in the\nDutchtown area, the Board convened a “Growth Impact Committee.” Troy\nGautreau, Sr., a Board member and chairman of the Committee, presented the\nBoard with a “Growth Impact Charter,” which included the following\n“objectives”: (1) “develop a plan to address the growth with minimal impact on\n\n\n       1 The facts of this case were recounted in detail in this Court’s 2011 opinion. This\nopinion incorporates much of the “Background” section of that opinion verbatim, see Lewis v.\nAscension Par. Sch. Bd., 662 F.3d 343, 344–45 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam), varying only to\nnote additional facts found by the district court during the bench trial. The parties do not\ndispute the essential facts underlying this suit.\n       2 The District constructed Dutchtown High School in 2002 to address the population\n\ngrowth in the Dutchtown area. Correspondingly, that year the District also implemented a\nnew school attendance zone “feeder plan” that included Dutchtown High School.\n                                             2\n\f     Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476         Page: 3     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\nresidents”; (2) “ensure equal facilities and instructional quality for all children”;\n(3) attain “enrollment maximums” established for the elementary, middle, and\nhigh school levels; and (4) “maintain unitary status.” (alterations omitted).\nAccording to then-Superintendent Donald Songy, the District sought to move\napproximately 450 students from Dutchtown Middle School, and thus out of\nDutchtown High School’s feeder zone, to other east bank schools with capacity\nfor growth.\n       To facilitate the Board’s consideration of various rezoning options,\nSuperintendent Songy, Gautreau, and other Board members requested that\nDemographics Application Specialist David Duplechein generate demographic\ndata for several plans. Using the District’s “Edulog” computer program—which\n“geographically code[d] all students actually enrolled in the school system based\non their physical residential addresses”—Duplechein projected the demographic\neffects of various prospective rezoning plans. Ultimately, the Board, which\ngoverns the District, narrowed its consideration down to four rezoning plans,\nreferred to as Options 1, 2, 2f, and 3.\n       Between 2004 and 2007, Gautreau delivered several PowerPoint\npresentations to the Board on the topic of rezoning. In a 2004 presentation,\nGautreau discussed the persistent overcrowding issues in several of the\nDistrict’s primary and middle schools. The presentation indicated that, since\nthe implementation of the 2002 feeder plan that accompanied the construction\nof Dutchtown High School, the percentage of at-risk students 3 at the primary\nand middle schools in the East Ascension High School feeder zone had\nincreased and the average School Performance Scores (“SPS”) 4 at those schools\n\n\n       3 “‘At-risk’ students are those who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch due to\ndisadvantaged socioeconomic status.” Lewis, 662 F.3d at 346 n.7.\n       4 School Performance Scores are calculated according to a formula devised by the\n\nLouisiana Department of Education. They represent a combination of end-of-course test\n                                              3\n\f     Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476         Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30030\nhad decreased. It further highlighted a decline in student enrollment, SPS, and\nstandardized test scores, and an increase in the percentage of at-risk students,\nat East Ascension High School. In addition, the presentation delineated the\nnegative effects of a higher at-risk student population, emphasizing that “the\nconcentration of poverty within a school can be shown to be harmful to all\nstudents in that school whether or not an individual student comes from a poor\nbackground.” It concluded that “a higher percentage of majority students\nshould increase at[-]risk achievement.” It is unclear whether the presentation\nincorporated demographic data derived from Edulog.\n       By 2006, the enrollment of Dutchtown Middle School, a Dutchtown High\nSchool feeder school, had risen to over 1,000 students, causing severe\novercrowding. No other east bank middle school had more than 730 students\nenrolled. Accordingly, in 2006 or 2007 Gautreau prepared another PowerPoint\npresentation that examined Options 2f and 3 in detail. The presentation\ncompared then-current racial demographics at each of the high schools,\nprojected total enrollment at several primary and middle schools, projected\npercentages of “black” and “white” students at several primary and middle\nschools, and projected percentage of “Title I” 5 and “fully paid” students at\nseveral primary and middle schools. It concluded that Option 3 “clearly offers\nthe best opportunity for all students in Ascension Parish and avoids putting\nan undue burden on one particular school by increasing the at[-]risk student\npopulation.” (alteration omitted). As with Gautreau’s 2004 presentation, it is\nunclear whether the 2006–2007 presentation incorporated Edulog data.\n\n\nresults, ACT scores, four-year graduation numbers, and graduation credentials (e.g.,\nadvanced placement courses, entry-based certifications, etc.).\n       5 Title I schools have a high number or a high percentage of students from low-income\n\nfamilies. They derive this name from Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., which authorizes awards of federal financial assistance to\nschools with a qualifying population of low-income students.\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-30030      Document: 00513274476        Page: 5     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30030\n      Sometime after 2007, Gautreau created a chart using Edulog data that\nprojected the total enrollment and the percentages of “minority” and at-risk\nstudents at each of the three east bank high schools under each of the rezoning\noptions under consideration. The chart indicated, in relevant part, that: (1)\nunder current conditions, with no redistricting, (a) the enrollment of\nDutchtown High School would increase from 1695 students in 2007 to 2072\nstudents in 2012, a total student population exceeding the 2012 projections at\nEast Ascension High School and St. Amant High School by 700 students and\n400 students, respectively, and (b) the percentage of at-risk students in all\nthree high schools would increase, with the largest jump occurring at East\nAscension High School; and (2) under each of Options 2, 2f, and 3, (a) the total\nenrollment in all three schools would increase but would approach parity, and\n(b) the percentage of at-risk students in all three high schools would increase,\nagain with the largest jump occurring at East Ascension High School. 6\n       In 2008, Superintendent Songy also compiled a chart with Edulog data,\ntitled “Statistical Analysis of Options 1, 2, 2f and 3,” and presented it to the\nBoard for consideration. The chart listed the current enrollment, percentage of\nAfrican–American students, and percentage of at-risk students at each school\nin the district, then projected the enrollment, percentage of African–American\nstudents, and percentage of at-risk students at each school under each of the\nfour rezoning options. Unlike Gautreau’s chart, Songy’s chart did not project\ndata beyond the 2007–2008 school year. Songy’s chart indicated, in relevant\npart, that: (1) the current African-American population at East Ascension High\nSchool exceeded that of the other high schools, but would decrease at East\nAscension High School and would increase at the remaining schools under any\n\n\n      6Notably, Gautreau’s chart seems to replicate the projected demographics of St.\nAmant High School with no redistricting plan in the projections under Options 2, 2f, and 3.\n                                            5\n\f     Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476         Page: 6     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\nplan; (2) the at-risk population at East Ascension High School would decrease\nunder any plan, with the greatest drop under Option 3 and the second greatest\ndrop under Option 2f; (3) the at-risk populations at Dutchtown High School and\nSt. Amant High School would increase under any plan; and (4) the total student\nenrollment would increase at East Ascension High School and St. Amant High\nSchool, but not at Dutchtown High School, under any plan. 7\n       At its January 15, 2008 meeting, Gautreau discussed the School Board’s\nredistricting efforts and, according to the meeting minutes, told the School\nBoard and audience that “the criteria most concentrated on was [sic]\nmaintaining our current unitary status with the Department of Justice and\nmoving the least amount of kids as possible.” Lewis, 662 F.3d at 345. Gautreau\nalso “informed the public that Option 2f or Option 3 needed to be passed by the\nSchool Board that night, and that some people would be upset with the School\nBoard’s decision.” 8 Following remarks by each of the eleven Board members and\nby nineteen members of the public, the Board voted on Options 2f and 3. 9 Option\n3 failed by a vote of six to four, then Option 2f passed by a vote of the same\nmargin, with precisely the same voting blocs on either side. Each Board member\nwas in possession of Songy’s chart at the time of the vote, but it is unclear which\nBoard members, if any, were in possession of Gautreau’s chart or presentations.\nFour of the six Board members who voted in favor of Option 2f testified at the\nbench trial, and each Board member who testified stated that, at the time of the\nvote, they were aware of the demographic projections and of the correlation\nbetween at-risk status and lower academic achievement.\n\n\n\n\n       7  Similarly to Gautreau’s chart, Songy’s chart seems to replicate the same projections\nfor St. Amant High School in each plan.\n        8 Neither party presented evidence to explain Gautreau’s remark.\n        9 Neither party offered a transcript of the Board members’ or the public’s comments.\n\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\n        Option 2f employed several means to shift the student population among\nthe east bank schools. First, it redrew the District’s geographic attendance lines\nso that a number of students were moved from the Dutchtown and St. Amant\nHigh School feeder zones to the East Ascension High School feeder zone. In total,\nOption 2f moved 339 students into different feeder zones during the 2008–2009\nschool year. Second, Option 2f moved Duplessis Primary School, a Title I school,\nfrom the Dutchtown feeder zone to the East Ascension feeder zone. As a result,\nall five of the primary schools in the East Ascension feeder zone were now Title\nI schools. Third, Option 2f assigned one new primary school and one new middle\nschool to the East Ascension feeder zone, two new primary schools to the\nDutchtown feeder zone, and three new primary schools to the St. Amant feeder\nzone.\n        According to data collected by the Louisiana Department of Education,\nsince the implementation of Option 2f, total student enrollment has increased\nat all three east bank high schools; the percentage of at-risk students has\nincreased at all three east bank high schools; and East Ascension High School\nhas maintained the highest percentages of nonwhite students and at-risk\nstudents among the east bank high schools, and those percentages have each\ngrown from 2007 to 2013. In addition, the percentages of both nonwhite\nstudents and at-risk students at each primary school and middle school in the\nEast Ascension feeder zone have increased during this time.\n        Further, it is undisputed that, since the adoption of Option 2f the\nmajority of the District’s nonwhite students and a majority of the District’s at-\nrisk students attend schools in the East Ascension feeder zone; East Ascension\nHigh School is the only majority nonwhite and majority at-risk high school in\nthe District; a majority of the East Ascension feeder schools are majority\nnonwhite, unlike the Dutchtown and St. Amant feeder schools; and all of the\n\n                                        7\n\f     Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476    Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-30030\nEast Ascension feeder schools are majority at-risk, unlike the Dutchtown and\nSt. Amant feeder schools.\n      The evidence of academic performance under Option 2f is mixed. The\naverage ACT score for the 2013 graduating class at East Ascension was 19.4,\nlower than St. Amant’s average score of 20.3 and Dutchtown’s average score of\n21.3, and lower than the state’s average score of 19.5, but average ACT scores\nalso declined for all three schools during this time. Additionally, Dutchtown and\nSt. Amant high school students performed better than East Ascension students\non Advanced Placement (“AP”) exams in the 2011-2012 academic year.\nDutchtown also attained superior SPS to East Ascension High School, both\nbefore and after the implementation of Option 2f. In the 2007–2008 school year,\nEast Ascension’s SPS was 95.1, compared to Dutchtown’s SPS of 109.8. In the\n2012–2013 school year—after the Department of Education revised the SPS\nscale from 150 points to 200 points—East Ascension’s SPS was 135.2, compared\nto Dutchtown’s SPS of 163.3 and St. Amant’s SPS of 149.7. On the other hand,\nEast Ascension’s SPS has gradually increased since the implementation of\nOption 2f, and its state school ranking and graduation rate are now at all-time\nhighs.\nB.    Procedural Background\n      1.    The Suit\n      Shortly after the adoption of Option 2f, Lewis, the father of two African–\nAmerican schoolchildren assigned to the East Ascension feeder zone both pre-\nand post-Option 2f, filed suit against the Board in Louisiana state court. Lewis,\n662 F.3d at 345. Lewis sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, asserting violations of his\nchildren’s Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection. Id. at 346. He\nessentially raised two challenges to Option 2f: first, he alleged that the Board\nadopted Option 2f “to ensure that East Ascension High School [and its feeder\n\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476        Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nschools] would maintain a disproportionately large non-white minority\npopulation, leaving the remaining two East Bank schools as predominantly\nwhite” (the “racial balancing” claim), id. (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); and second, he alleged that because Option 2f placed\na disproportionate number of at-risk students in the East Ascension feeder\nzone, “Option 2f ‘would ensure that the nonwhite minority students at East\nAscension High School [and in its feeder system] would not, now and in the\nfuture, be afforded educational opportunities equal to those available to the\nstudents at either Dutchtown High School or St. Amant High School” (the\n“funneling” claim), id. (alteration in original).\n      The Board removed the action to federal court and successfully moved\nfor summary judgment. Id. The district court found Option 2f facially race\nneutral and concluded that Lewis had not presented competent evidence of\nboth discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect so as to invoke strict\nscrutiny. Id. It then upheld the plan on rational basis review because the Board\nhad a legitimate government interest in reducing overcrowding. Id.\n      2.    The First Appeal\n      A divided panel of this Court reversed. Id. at 352. The Court held, first,\nthat Lewis’s racial-balancing claim was not preserved and that Lewis’s only\nlive claims were his funneling claim and his claim that Option 2f employs\nexplicit racial classifications. Id. at 348 & n.11. It then criticized the district\ncourt’s analysis, which relied in part on evidence that the Board “considered\n[the race of reassigned students] in an effort at maintaining the racial balance\nalready existing among the schools in East Ascension Parish and in\nmaintaining the school district’s unitary status, not as part of a racially\ndiscriminatory motive to allocate a ‘disproportionate number’ of African–\nAmerican students to the East Ascension school zone.” Id. at 349. The Court\n\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476      Page: 10    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30030\nraised two concerns with this reasoning: first, “it is unclear how, on the record\nbefore us, the court could make a factual finding as a matter of law about the\nBoard’s lack of discriminatory purpose”; and second, “the court’s assumption\nthat it might be justifiable to use racially-based decisions for the ‘benign’\npurpose of maintaining post-unitary ‘racial balance’ among the schools in the\nsystem is at least in tension with the Supreme Court’s decision in Parents\nInvolved.” Id.\n      The Court then identified several pieces of evidence that created a\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the Board’s discriminatory purpose.\nId. at 350–52. First, the Court cited the Board’s reliance on Edulog data, noting\nthat Edulog “coded each enrolled student in order to predict the ‘statistical\neffects’ of Option 2f’s boundary assignments” and that, in turn, “it is unclear\nhow a student assignment plan could calculate the percentage of black\nstudents at each school without classifying individual students by race.” Id. at\n350. The Court rejected the Board’s explanation “that the Statistical Analysis\nunderlying Option 2f . . . does not constitute Option 2f itself” because “to accept\nthat self-serving, summary allegation would be to allow a school district to\nskew reality by selectively including documents in the record and labeling only\nthose documents its ‘plan.’” Id. This, the Court said, it could not countenance\non review of a summary judgment. Id.\n      Next, the Court quoted the testimony of Superintendent Songy and\nvarious Board members that “suggest[ed] that the District relied upon the race\nof the individual students residing in different geographic locations when it re-\nzoned its schools.” Id. at 350–51. The Court also cited an excerpt from the\nDistrict’s website that referred to “alter[ing] the racial balance” and\n“balanc[ing] the demograph[ics]” at East Ascension. Id. at 351 (second\nalteration in original). In response to the district court’s finding that “‘only’ 339\n\n                                         10\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476           Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30030\nstudents, in a district population of 18,000, were affected by Option 2f,” the\nCourt observed that, “[i]n light of the testimony, this seems to be a group\nidentifiable and identified principally on racial grounds (whether minority or\nnot) for assignment to particular schools.” Id.\n       Lastly, the Court concluded that there were material questions of fact\nsurrounding the discriminatory effect of Option 2f. Id. Criticizing the district\ncourt for basing its finding on a statistical analysis of Option 2f’s impact on\nonly the east bank high schools, the Court pointed out that Lewis alleged a\ndiscriminatory effect on the East Ascension feeder system. Id. The statistics in\nthe record, the Court said, “provide some support” for Lewis’s funneling claim.\nId. at 352. The Court gave particular attention to statistics showing disparities\nbetween the percentage of the total east bank student population enrolled in\neach feeder system and the percentage of the east bank’s total at-risk student\npopulation and total nonwhite student population in each feeder system. Id. at\n351–52. 10 In any event, the Court declined to identify the pertinent standard\nof review, holding that the determination of whether to apply strict scrutiny or\nrational basis review “turns on the factual questions of discriminatory motive\nand impact.” Id. at 352.\n       3.      Remand, Pretrial Motions, and the Bench Trial\n       On remand, the district court permitted additional discovery; then both\nparties moved for summary judgment. The district court denied Lewis’s motion\nand granted in part and denied in part the Board’s motion. Two aspects of the\ndistrict court’s ruling are relevant here. First, the district court “conclude[d]\n\n\n\n       10  Importantly, these statistics appear only in Lewis’s submissions on summary\njudgment. Lewis appears to have derived these statistics from data compiled by Bridget\nThomas, a “concerned parent,” whose children attended schools within the District and who\ntestified as a lay witness at trial. There is no mention of these statistics in Lewis’s post-trial\nbriefing or in his appellate briefs.\n                                               11\n\f    Case: 15-30030      Document: 00513274476     Page: 12   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nthat the School Board’s consideration of projected racial and socioeconomic\ndata prior to voting does not amount to a racial classification.” It\ncorrespondingly denied “Lewis’[s] request that the Court review Option 2f\nunder strict scrutiny on this basis” and granted “[t]he School Board’s request\nthat the Court dismiss Lewis’[s] claim that Option 2f employs a racial\nclassification.” Second, the district court denied “the School Board’s request\nthat the Court dismiss Lewis’[s] remaining Equal Protection claim on th[e]\nbasis” that “Lewis cannot establish that [his children] were treated differently\nthan similarly situated students of a different race”—namely, white students\nin the Dutchtown and St. Amant feeder zones. Despite announcing that it was\n“unable to consider all of the evidence presented until after a full trial on the\nmerits,” the district court “conclude[d],” based on “the evidence presented here,\n[the] context of this matter, and factors considered by the School Board when\nit adopted Option 2f,” that the plaintiff’s children “are, in fact, similarly\nsituated to white students in the Dutchtown High School and St. Amant High\nSchool feeder zones.”\n      The case proceeded to a three-day bench trial. At the opening of the trial,\nthe Board orally requested that the district court reconsider several of its rulings\nin its summary-judgment order, including its conclusion on the “similarly\nsituated” issue. The district court denied the Board’s requests without prejudice\nto the Board’s right to reurge them in its post-trial briefs. Lewis made no request\nthat the district court reconsider its ruling that Option 2f did not employ racial\nclassifications.\n      At trial, Lewis called ten witnesses: five members of the Board who voted\non Option 2f, Demographics Application Specialist Duplechein, Lewis, Lewis’s\nson, Bridget Thomas (a “concerned parent” who compiled statistics on the\nrezoning options), and Dr. Percy Bates (an expert witness in educational\n\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476       Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\npsychology). The Board, in turn, called two witnesses: Patrice Pujol, current\nSuperintendent of the Board, and former Superintendent Songy.\n      Following post-trial briefing, the district court issued Rule 52 findings of\nfact and conclusions of law. The court’s findings of fact are summarized in Part\nI(A), supra. The court opened its conclusions of law with a summary of Lewis’s\ntheory:\n     “Here, the gravamen of Lewis’s section 1983 claim is that the School\n     Board has denied nonwhite students in the East Ascension High\n     School attendance zone equal educational opportunities, in\n     violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting a school\n     rezoning plan that ‘feeds’ a disproportionate number of at-risk\n     students into the East Ascension High School attendance zone.”\nThe court then held that: (1) Option 2f does not employ explicit racial\nclassifications, (2) Lewis failed to prove that nonwhite students in the East\nAscension attendance zone are similarly situated to white students in the\nDutchtown and St. Amant attendance zones, and, in turn, that Option 2f accords\ndisparate treatment to similarly situated students of a different race, and (3)\neven if Lewis had proven that Option 2f treats similarly situated students\ndifferently on the basis of race, the record evidence does not support the\nconclusion that Option 2f has had a discriminatory effect on nonwhite students\nin the East Ascension feeder zone. Accordingly, the court omitted discussion of\nwhether the Board acted with a discriminatory purpose. In addition, the court\ndid not identify the level of scrutiny it would apply to Lewis’s challenge to Option\n2f; it held only that “Lewis has not satisfied his burden of proving by a\npreponderance of the evidence that [the Board’s] adoption of Option 2f violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause.” Lewis timely appealed.\n\n\n            II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476          Page: 14     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\n       The district court had jurisdiction over Lewis’s suit pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1331. This Court has jurisdiction to review the district court’s final judgment\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n       “The standard of review for a bench trial is well established: findings of\nfact are reviewed for clear error and legal issues are reviewed de novo.” Bd. of\nTrs. New Orleans Emp’rs Int’l Longshoremen’s Ass’n v. Gabriel, Roeder, Smith\n& Co., 529 F.3d 506, 509 (5th Cir. 2008) (quoting Water Craft Mgmt. LLC v.\nMercury Marine, 457 F.3d 484, 488 (5th Cir. 2006)). “A finding is clearly\nerroneous if it is without substantial evidence to support it, the court\nmisinterpreted the effect of the evidence, or this court is convinced that the\nfindings are against the preponderance of credible testimony.” Id.\n                                    III. DISCUSSION\n       The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment mandates\nthat “[n]o State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. “Its central purpose is to\nprevent the States from purposefully discriminating between individuals on\nthe basis of race.” Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993). Accordingly, “[l]aws\nthat explicitly distinguish between individuals on racial grounds fall within\nthe core of that prohibition,” id., and are subject to strict scrutiny, Hunt v.\nCromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 546 (1999). “Strict scrutiny also applies to\ngovernment action that is ‘ostensibly neutral,’ but only if the neutral law has\na ‘disproportionately adverse effect’ that ‘can be traced to a discriminatory\npurpose.’” Lewis, 662 F.3d at 348 (quoting Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442\nU.S. 256, 272 (1979)). 11 Under strict scrutiny, “the burden [is] on the\n\n\n       11Strict scrutiny also applies to “a classification that is ostensibly neutral but is an\nobvious pretext for racial discrimination.” Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272 (citing, inter alia, Yick Wo\nv. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886)). This class of actions refers to facially neutral laws that are\napplied in a discriminatory fashion—as, for instance, “a laundry permit ordinance . . .\n                                              14\n\f     Case: 15-30030      Document: 00513274476          Page: 15     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\ngovernment to prove that its actions are narrowly tailored to achieve a\ncompelling government interest.” Id. By contrast, where there is no proof of\neither discriminatory purpose or discriminatory effect, the government action\nis subject to rational basis review, id., and the burden is on the challenger to\nrebut the “strong presumption of validity” accorded the action and prove that\nthe action is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose, Heller\nv. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319–20 (1993).\n       At trial, Lewis mounted a two-pronged attack on Option 2f: he alleged\nthat Option 2f was subject to strict scrutiny (1) because it contains explicit\nracial classifications, and, alternatively, (2) because its funneling feature was\nmotivated by racial animus and had a disproportionately adverse impact on\nnonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder zone. On appeal, he contends\nthat the district court committed numerous errors in entering judgment\nagainst him. We address each claim of error in turn.\nA.     Option 2f and Explicit Racial Classifications\n       Lewis first urges that the district court erred in holding that Option 2f\ndoes not explicitly classify students on the basis of race.\n       Although the district court granted summary judgment to the Board on\nLewis’s claim that Option 2f should be subjected to strict scrutiny because it\nemploys express racial classifications, it rejected this argument anew in its\nRule 52 findings of fact and conclusions of law. It cited three grounds for its\ndecision: (1) the court had previously ruled against Lewis, and Lewis had not\nrequested reconsideration; (2) “a review of the evidence supports the conclusion\nthat Option 2f does not employ an explicit racial classification” because the\n\n\nadministered in a deliberate way to exclude all Chinese from the laundry business.” Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 913 (1995) (citing Yick Wo, 118 U.S. 356). The district court held that\nLewis did not advance this theory of discrimination at trial and Lewis does not argue to the\ncontrary on appeal.\n                                             15\n\f    Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476          Page: 16     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\nplan is facially race neutral and “Lewis failed to point to any provision of\nOption 2f that classifies students on the basis of race[ ] or uses race as a factor\nin school assignment”; and (3) “the School Board’s consideration of the\nprojected enrollment and percentage of nonwhite and ‘at-risk’ students . . . does\nnot amount to a rezoning plan that assigns students on the basis of race.”\n       Given these ostensible alternative rulings—one procedural and one on\nthe merits—we requested supplemental briefing on the ruling subject to appeal\nand the corresponding standard of review. The parties agreed that the district\ncourt reconsidered its summary judgment ruling sua sponte when it announced\na post-trial merits holding, see, e.g., Zarnow v. City of Wichita Falls, Tex., 614\nF.3d 161, 171 (5th Cir. 2010), and our standard of review therefore tracks that\napplicable to an ordinary bench trial: we review findings of fact for clear error\nand legal issues de novo, Bd. of Trs., 529 F.3d at 509.\n       “It is well established that when the government distributes burdens or\nbenefits on the basis of individual racial classifications, that action is reviewed\nunder strict scrutiny.” Parents Involved in Cmty. Schs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No.\n1, 551 U.S. 701, 720 (2007). “A statute or policy utilizes a ‘racial classification’\nwhen, on its face, it explicitly distinguishes between people on the basis of some\nprotected category.” Hayden v. Cty. of Nassau, 180 F.3d 42, 48 (2d Cir. 1999)\n(citing Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995); Wygant v.\nJackson Bd. of Educ., 476 U.S. 267, 282–84 (1986); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S.\n1, 11–12 (1967)).\n       Although the Supreme Court has not addressed the facial neutrality of\nschool district boundaries in the context of a post-desegregation equal\nprotection challenge, 12 we find its precedents on electoral redistricting\n\n\n       12Significantly, in Parents Involved, a case on which Lewis places great emphasis,\n“the school district[s] relie[d] upon an individual student’s race in assigning that student to\n                                              16\n\f    Case: 15-30030         Document: 00513274476            Page: 17      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30030\ninstructive. In this context, the Court has repeatedly made clear that\nredistricting plans do not classify individuals and are therefore facially race\nneutral. 13 As a result, “a more searching inquiry is necessary before strict\nscrutiny can be found applicable in redistricting cases than in cases of\n‘classifications based explicitly on race.’” Bush, 517 U.S. at 958. Moreover, the\nCourt has unequivocally stated that a legislative body’s mere awareness or\nconsideration of racial demographics in drawing district boundaries will not\nalone trigger strict scrutiny. 14 To the contrary, the challenger must\ndemonstrate that race was “the predominant factor motivating the\nlegislature’s decision.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. To make this showing, the\nchallenger is obligated to prove—using direct or circumstantial evidence, or a\ncombination of the two—“that ‘the legislature subordinated traditional race-\nneutral districting principles, including . . . compactness, contiguity, and\nrespect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared\ninterests, to racial considerations[.]’” Hunt, 526 U.S. at 547 (quoting Miller,\n\n\na particular school, so that the racial balance at the school f[ell] within a predetermined range\nbased on the racial composition of the school district as a whole.” 551 U.S. at 710. In both\nstudent-assignment plans at issue in Parents Involved, students applied to or were assigned\nto individual schools and their race was taken into consideration in the district’s admission\ndecision. Id. at 711–12, 716–17. The school districts’ geographical boundaries were not at\nissue.\n         13 See Hunt, 526 U.S. at 547 (“Districting legislation ordinarily, if not always, classifies\n\ntracts of land, precincts, or census blocks, and is race neutral on its face.”); Bush v. Vera, 517\nU.S. 952, 958 (1996) (plurality opinion) (“Electoral district lines are ‘facially race neutral’ . .\n. .”); Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646 (“A reapportionment statute typically does not classify persons at\nall; it classifies tracts of land, or addresses.”).\n         14 See Bush, 517 U.S. at 958 (plurality opinion) (“Strict scrutiny does not apply merely\n\nbecause redistricting is performed with consciousness of race. Nor does it apply to all cases\nof intentional creation of majority-minority districts.” (internal citation omitted)); Miller v.\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995) (“Redistricting legislatures will, for example, almost\nalways be aware of racial demographics; but it does not follow that race predominates in the\nredistricting process.”); Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646 (“[R]edistricting differs from other kinds of\nstate decisionmaking in that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws district\nlines . . . . That sort of race consciousness does not lead inevitably to impermissible race\ndiscrimination.”).\n                                                17\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476          Page: 18      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30030\n515 U.S. at 916). One form of circumstantial evidence is the shape of the\ndistrict, which may, in some cases, be so “bizarre” or “highly irregular that, on\nits face, it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to\nsegregat[e] . . . voters on the basis of race.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 914 (alteration\nand ellipsis in original) (quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646–47) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). 15\n       While there is no post-Parents Involved law in this Circuit assessing\nwhether school redistricting plans like Option 2f contain express racial\nclassifications, the Third and Sixth Circuits have recently held that school\nzoning plans that divide the student population by geography are facially race\nneutral. See Spurlock v. Fox, 716 F.3d 383, 394–96 (6th Cir. 2013); Doe ex rel.\nDoe v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 665 F.3d 524, 545–48 (3d Cir. 2011).\nImportantly, both of these cases affirmed bench-trial verdicts in favor of the\nschool districts, Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 385; Lower Merion, 665 F.3d at 539, 558,\nand both cases were decided after this Court issued its first opinion in Lewis.\nIn both Spurlock and Lower Merion, the courts distinguished Parents Involved\nas a case speaking only to student-assignment plans that explicitly use a\nstudent’s race as a factor in assignments; a plan that, on its face, relies\nexclusively on a student’s home address is necessarily race neutral, and\nParents Involved has no application. Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 394; Lower Merion,\n665 F.3d at 545–46. Additionally, both courts rejected the students’ arguments\nthat the rezoning bodies’ consideration of racial demographic data in\n\n\n       15 It is not clear from the Court’s discussion whether evidence of “predominance” can\nestablish an express racial classification, or whether this evidence is used to prove that the\nfacially neutral districts are nonetheless the product of discrimination. The Court’s analysis\nin Hunt, which opened with the observation that the challenged redistricting plan was “race\nneutral on its face” and described the challengers’ burden to prove that “race was the\n‘predominant factor’ motivating the legislature’s districting decision,” suggests the latter. 526\nU.S. at 547. The same does not seem to be true of evidence of “bizarreness,” which, the Court\nsaid in Miller, may evince discrimination “on its face.” 515 U.S. at 913, 914.\n                                              18\n\f    Case: 15-30030         Document: 00513274476            Page: 19      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                         No. 15-30030\nformulating the district boundaries amounted to an express racial\nclassification. 16 To this end, the Third Circuit relied in part on the Supreme\nCourt’s electoral redistricting precedents. See Lower Merion, 665 F.3d at 547.\nAnd, notably, the Sixth Circuit held that its conclusion was not inconsistent\nwith this Court’s opinion in Lewis. Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 395–96. 17\n       Before this Court, Lewis contends that the record evidence and the trial\ncourt’s findings of fact “clearly show that race was an important stand alone [sic]\nfactor in the adoption of Option 2f and that a main goal of Option 2f was to keep\na specific balance of racial groups in each East Bank school in order to maintain\nunitary status.” This, Lewis says, is contrary to Parents Involved, in which the\nCourt “held that a unitary school district’s decision to classify students by race\n\n\n\n       16  See Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 394 (observing that the rezoning body “obtained data on\nthe racial breakdown of students . . . under the old student-assignment plan, as well as\nprojections of student enrollment by race in the event that various modifications were\nadopted” but rejecting the argument that “obtaining this data and including some of it in the\nRezoning Plan shows that the Plan classifies students by race” because “[r]acial classification\nrequires more than the consideration of racial data”); Lower Merion, 665 F.3d at 548\n(criticizing the students for “conflat[ing] a school assignment policy that explicitly classifies\nbased on race with the consideration or awareness of neighborhood racial demographics\nduring the development and selection of a policy” and holding that “[d]esigning a policy ‘with\nracial factors in mind’ does not constitute a racial classification if the policy is facially neutral\nand is administered in a race-neutral fashion”).\n         17 The Sixth Circuit interpreted Lewis’s holding—that factual issues regarding\n\ndiscriminatory purpose and effect precluded summary judgment—as “a holding with respect\nto the issue of de jure segregation, not racial classification.” Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 395.\nHowever, the Sixth Circuit criticized this Court’s opinion as internally inconsistent in its\nexpress-classification analysis: although “[t]he court nowhere opined that the consideration\nof demographic data alone amounts to a classification by race . . . , certain confusing\npronouncements in the Lewis per curiam opinion appear to suggest the contrary.” 716 F.3d\nat 395 (citing Lewis, 662 F.3d at 350 (“Indeed, it is unclear how a student assignment plan\ncould calculate the percentage of black students at each school without classifying individual\nstudents by race.”)). The Sixth Circuit resolved this ambiguity by crediting the Lewis dissent\nand observing that “if the court majority had truly believed that there was racial\nclassification at play, it would have ordered the district court on remand to subject the\nchallenged policy to strict scrutiny, which it did not do.” Id. at 395–96. Moreover, the Spurlock\ncourt remarked, “to the extent that certain statements in Lewis conflict with Supreme Court\nprecedent, the latter obviously prevails.” Id. at 396.\n                                                19\n\f    Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476      Page: 20    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nand to rely on that classification in determining school assignments is subject to\nstrict scrutiny.” Lewis’s position hinges on the premise that Option 2f is more\nthan the maps and written descriptions laying out the geographic boundaries of\nthe feeder zones; in his view, the demographic analysis underlying Option 2f\nclassifies students on the basis of race, and this data, as well as the race-\nconscious motives of the Board members, evince express racial classifications in\nthe plan.\n      The Board counters that the district court correctly looked only to the\nface of Option 2f to assess its race neutrality, and it contends that the court’s\nfinding that none of the documents that make up Option 2f include any\nreference to race is not clearly erroneous. The Board urges this Court to follow\nthe Third and Sixth Circuits and hold that a school zoning plan that assigns\nstudents to schools based on their home addresses is facially race neutral, and\nthe rezoning body’s consideration of demographic data in drawing the relevant\ngeographic boundaries does not amount to making an express classification.\nLastly, the Board posits that even if Option 2f incorporated Gautreau’s or\nSongy’s statistical analysis, the plan would still not contain any express racial\nclassifications because there is no provision that “identif[ies] any classification\nby individual student or group for purposes of school assignment” or that\n“require[s] the consideration of race when enrolling students in any school.”\n      We agree with the Board and find no error in the district court’s ruling\nthat Option 2f contains no explicit racial classifications. Lewis provides no basis\nfor this Court to conclude that the district court’s factual finding that Option 2f\nis facially race neutral and assigns students to schools on the sole basis of\ngeography is clearly erroneous. The only evidence he points to on appeal relates\nto the Board’s awareness of racial demographics and its alleged desire to\nmaintain the District’s unitary status through racial balancing. Under the\n\n                                        20\n\f     Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476            Page: 21      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                          No. 15-30030\nSupreme Court’s electoral-redistricting precedents, and consistent with the\nThird and Sixth Circuit’s reasoning, this evidence has no bearing on the facial\nneutrality of the Board’s action—at least absent evidence that the geographic\nboundaries are explicable only as the product of intentional segregation, see\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 914; see also supra note 16; cf. Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 394;\nLower Merion, 665 F.3d at 548. Even accepting Lewis’s position that Option 2f\nincorporated the demographic data and projections, this does not establish that\nthe plan explicitly classified students by race; it shows only that the Board\nconsidered the same sort of data that the Supreme Court has refused to equate\nto a facial racial classification, albeit in the electoral context. 18 See Bush, 517\nU.S. at 958; Miller, 515 U.S. at 916; Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646. It also does not\nbring the plan within the ambit of Parents Involved, as that case addressed\nindividualized student assignments that took into account the student’s race\nand the overall racial makeup of the school. See supra note 13.\n       Likewise, the district court’s legal conclusion that the Board’s\nconsideration of demographic data in formulating Option 2f “does not amount to\n[adopting] a rezoning plan that assigns students on the basis of race” conforms\nto Supreme Court case law, see, e.g., Bush, 517 U.S. at 958, and is in accord with\nthe decisions of this Court’s sister circuits, see Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 394; Lower\nMerion, 665 F.3d at 548. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err\nin concluding that Option 2f does not make express racial classifications and so\nis not subject to strict scrutiny on that basis.\nB.     The Discriminatory Purpose and Effect of Option 2f\n\n\n\n\n       18  Lewis has not argued that Option 2f’s boundaries are so “bizarre” or “highly\nirregular” that, on its face, the plan “rationally cannot be understood as anything other than\nan effort to segregat[e] . . . on the basis of race.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 914 (alteration in original)\n(quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646–47) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                                 21\n\f    Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476      Page: 22   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\n      Lewis next contends that the district court erred in rejecting his\nalternative theory that, despite Option 2f’s facial neutrality, the redistricting\nplan’s funneling feature is nevertheless subject to strict scrutiny because it had\nboth a discriminatory purpose and a discriminatory effect. See Vill. of Arlington\nHeights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264–66 (1977) (holding that\nan equal protection claim premised on an outwardly neutral law requires proof\nof both a discriminatory effect and a discriminatory purpose). Relevant to this\ndetermination, the district court first found that the pertinent comparator group\nfor Lewis’s equal protection claim was white students within the East Ascension\nfeeder zone—not white students in the other feeder zones, as it had originally\nruled on post-remand summary judgment. It then found that, even if Lewis had\nsuccessfully established that nonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder\nzone were similarly situated to their white counterparts in the other feeder\nzones, he had not proven that Option 2f had a discriminatory adverse effect on\nnonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder zone. Lewis urges that the\ndistrict court erred in both regards.\n      Because we resolve the district court’s treatment of Lewis’s alternative\nequal protection theory on the discriminatory-effect finding, we need not\naddress either the court’s similarly situated finding or Lewis’s proffered\nevidence of discriminatory purpose. See id.; Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217,\n224 (1971) (“[N]o case in this Court has held that a legislative act may violate\nequal protection solely because of the motivations of the men who voted for\nit.”); Lower Merion, 665 F.3d at 549–50 (“[D]iscriminatory impact must be\nshown to establish an equal protection violation because ‘plaintiffs must show\nthat they have been injured as a result’ of the governmental action to ensure\nthat courts ‘can impose a meaningful remedy.’” (quoting Garza v. Cty. of Los\nAngeles, 918 F.2d 763, 771 (9th Cir. 1990))). We simply assume without\n\n                                        22\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476          Page: 23      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30030\ndeciding that it was Lewis’s burden to identify a similarly situated comparator\ngroup and that he met this burden, 19 and we proceed to the district court’s\nfinding on the issue of discriminatory impact.\n       As a preliminary matter, we note a disagreement between the parties\nconcerning the standard of review applicable to the district court’s\ndetermination. On one hand, there is general agreement that a finding of\ndiscriminatory effect is a finding of fact subject to review for clear error. 20 On\nthe other hand, there is authority for the proposition that where, as here, the\nfacts are essentially undisputed, the question of whether those facts evince a\ndiscriminatory effect is ultimately one of law that this Court reviews de novo. 21\n\n\n\n       19  We note that there is uncertainty in the law regarding the circumstances under\nwhich an equal protection plaintiff alleging racial discrimination is required to identify a\nsimilarly situated comparator group and the showing required to discharge this burden. See\ngenerally Giovanna Shay, Similarly Situated, 18 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 581 (2011). Although\nthe Third Circuit in Lower Merion conducted a similarly situated analysis—which informed\nthe district court’s analysis in this case—it did so without citation to authority. See 665 F.3d\nat 550. Moreover, Lower Merion addressed a different type of claim—that “targeting” a\nparticular area for redistricting “in part because that Community has one of the highest\nconcentrations of African–American students in the District” violates the Equal Protection\nClause, 665 F.3d at 540—and it grounded its similarly situated analysis in relevant part on\nevidence that the redistricting affected both white and nonwhite students in the “targeted\narea,” id. at 550. Not only does this formulation of the inquiry seem to preclude a finding of\ndisparate treatment, but it does not neatly track Lewis’s novel funneling theory. Accordingly,\nwe express no view on the district court’s treatment of this issue and merely assume without\ndeciding that Lewis proved that the nonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder zone are\nsimilarly situated to white students in the other feeder zones, as his theory of discrimination\npresumes.\n        20 See, e.g., Ortiz v. City of Phila. Office of City Comm’rs Voter Registration Div., 28\n\nF.3d 306, 308 (3d Cir. 1994) (“A district court’s conclusion that a challenged electoral practice\nhas a discriminatory effect is a question of fact subject to review for clear error.”); Velasquez\nv. City of Abilene, Tex., 725 F.2d 1017, 1021 (5th Cir. 1984) (“We have no doubt that the\nfinding of discriminatory effect or result under the Voting Rights Act amendments of 1982 is\nalso governed by the clearly erroneous standard, and while appellants try to argue that\ndilution     cases      involve      a mixed question of law    and fact not     governed      by\nthe clearly erroneous standard, we cannot embrace this argument.”).\n        21 See, e.g., Anderson ex rel. Dowd v. City of Bos., 375 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(“[W]hen the issues on appeal ‘raise[ ] either questions of law or questions about how the law\napplies to discerned facts,’ such as whether the proffered evidence establishes a\n                                              23\n\f    Case: 15-30030      Document: 00513274476      Page: 24    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30030\nWe assume without deciding that our review is de novo, as affirmance under\nthis standard compels the same result as under the more deferential\nalternative standard.\n      To subject a facially race neutral government action to strict scrutiny, the\nplaintiff must establish both discriminatory intent and a disproportionate\nadverse effect upon the targeted group. Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272. The\ndiscriminatory-impact element of an equal protection claim may be satisfied\nwith statistical evidence. See, e.g., Chavez v. Ill. State Police, 251 F.3d 612, 638\n(7th Cir. 2001) (“While few opinions directly acknowledge that statistics may be\nused to prove discriminatory effect, the Court has repeatedly relied on statistics\nto do just that.” (citing Yick Wo, 118 U.S. at 374 and Hunter v. Underwood, 471\nU.S. 222, 227 (1985))); accord Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, 410 F.3d 810, 818\n(6th Cir. 2005). “Of course, parties may not prove discrimination merely by\nproviding the court with statistical analyses. The statistics proffered must\naddress the crucial question of whether one class is being treated differently\nfrom another class that is otherwise similarly situated.” Chavez, 251 F.3d at\n638. Further, statistical analysis, like other expert testimony, must be “both\nrelevant and reliable,” and “[d]etermining the validity and value of statistical\nevidence is firmly within the discretion of the district court.” Id. at 641.\n      Although this Court has not spoken on the quantum of evidence sufficient\nto prove discriminatory impact as a matter of law, cases from other circuits shed\nsome light on the subject. In Chavez, the Seventh Circuit affirmed summary\njudgment in favor of the state-police defendants in a class action alleging that\nthe officers “utilize[d] impermissible racial classifications in determining whom\nto stop, detain, and search.” 251 F.3d at 635. The plaintiffs had obtained records\n\n\n\ndiscriminatory purpose or a disproportionate racial impact, ‘our review is essentially\nplenary.’”).\n                                         24\n\f      Case: 15-30030   Document: 00513274476     Page: 25   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nof citations and police field reports, which were used to document traffic stops,\nand had compared the race of the targets with various population benchmarks,\nincluding the Census and the Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. Id.\nat 642–44. After holding that the plaintiffs could utilize statistics to show\ndiscriminatory effect, id. at 640, the court independently reviewed the proffered\nstatistics and found them inadequate as a matter of law to carry the plaintiffs’\nburden, id. at 641, 645. As relevant here, the court cited the absence of evidence\nof the total number of field reports prepared (or even the number analyzed by\nthe plaintiffs) and the lack of an adequate population benchmark against which\nto measure whether the plaintiffs’ racial groups were stopped at a rate\ndisproportionate to their representation in the driving population. Id. at 643–\n44.\n        Similarly, in a case with facts closer to those presented here, the First\nCircuit in Anderson affirmed a bench-trial judgment in favor of the city\ndefendant in an equal protection challenge to a school-rezoning plan. 375 F.3d\nat 74, 79. To establish the discriminatory effect of the rezoning plan, the\nplaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony of a single witness. Id. at 88. The\nwitness, who lacked formal training in statistical analysis, “testified that she\nreviewed admissions data from ‘every school in the city,’ [but] she only presented\ndata for the 2002–03 admission rounds for one class in each of three schools.”\nId. The witness prepared charts for each of these schools, comparing the racial\ndemographics of students admitted under the new plan with those of students\nwho would have been eligible for admission under an alternative plan. Id. at 88–\n89. These charts showed that “in the three elementary schools—out of the 85 or\nso in the [public school] system—a total of twenty white students . . . were not\nadmitted under the actual [plan].” Id. at 89. Further, the plaintiffs declined to\n“engage in any systemwide analysis of the racial impact” of the plan, resting\n\n                                        25\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476      Page: 26   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30030\ninstead on the “individual examples of the racial effect” evident in the witness’s\ncharts. Id. The First Circuit held this evidence insufficient to show\ndiscriminatory effect—and, as a corollary, discriminatory purpose inferable\nfrom a gross statistical disparity. Id.\n      Here, the district court held that Lewis’s proffered evidence failed to\nestablish that Option 2f worked a discriminatory effect on nonwhite students in\nthe East Ascension feeder zone by funneling a disproportionate number of at-\nrisk students to their schools. Even accepting the undisputed evidence that the\npercentage of at-risk students in the East Ascension feeder zone increased after\nthe implementation of Option 2f, the court found that this was insufficient,\nstanding alone, to carry Lewis’s burden. The court found that the objective\nevidence of student performance adduced at trial—ACT scores, SPS, and AP\nclasses and exam results—was unpersuasive. Lewis only offered average ACT\nscores for a single year; although the scores placed East Ascension 0.1 point\nbelow the state average, 0.9 point below St. Amant, and 1.9 points below\nDutchtown, these results were neither broadly representative of student\nperformance nor relevant to the educational experiences of students in the East\nAscension feeder zone’s primary and middle schools. East Ascension High\nSchool’s SPS had “gradually increased since the implementation of Option 2f,”\nand although it was outpaced by Dutchtown’s and St. Amant’s SPS—by 28.1\npoints and 14.5 points, respectively—“Lewis failed to introduce evidence to\nestablish that these differences are statistically significant, or that such\ndifferences are the result of unequal educational opportunities[.]” The AP scores\nwere similarly unavailing: Lewis presented evidence of inferior performance by\nEast Ascension High School students in one academic year, but he again failed\nto establish statistical significance. And, as with the ACT scores, the SPS and\nAP performance related only to East Ascension High School and not its feeders.\n\n                                          26\n\f    Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476          Page: 27     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\n       Finally, the court rejected the opinion of Lewis’s expert, Dr. Percy Bates,\nas “meaningless.” Although Dr. Bates was qualified as “an expert on the impact\nof a disproportionate number of at-risk students on an academic environment,”\nhe based his expert report solely on “the general research findings of other\nexperts, student performance scores from 2006 and 2007, iLEAP test scores\nfrom 2006 and 2007, and Gautreau’s projections.” 22 He claimed that his opinion\nwas confirmed—and, indeed, strengthened—by the evidence he observed at\ntrial, but he conceded that he had not considered any post-Option 2f data in\nrendering his opinion in the first instance. In particular, he acknowledged that\nhe had not researched the quality of instruction or the course offerings in the\nEast Ascension schools relative to their counterparts in the other feeder zones,\nhe had not interviewed Lewis’s children, and he had not done any calculations\nof the actual effect of Option 2f on the at-risk population. As for Dr. Bates’s\n“research findings in other districts” and his consideration of “the general\nresearch findings of other experts,” the court noted that this research could be\n“instructive,” but “his failure to conduct an independent analysis in this case\nrenders his opinion meaningless.”\n       Lewis essentially makes two arguments on appeal. First, he contends\nthat the objective evidence of student performance he presented at trial,\ncoupled with Dr. Bates’s expert testimony, proved as a matter of law that\nOption 2f’s funneling caused a disproportionate adverse effect on the nonwhite\npopulation in the East Ascension feeder zone. Second, he asserts that the\ndistrict court committed legal error by faulting him for failing to prove\ndiscriminatory purpose, despite the court declining to reach that issue in the\nfirst instance.\n\n\n       22Notably, the district court observed that Lewis failed to introduce Dr. Bates’s expert\nreport into the trial record.\n                                              27\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476          Page: 28      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30030\n       We find that Lewis failed to prove as a matter of law that Option 2f’s\nfunneling feature had a racially discriminatory effect. Lewis’s statistical\nevidence is stronger than that offered in Anderson, as it at least offers a glance\nat the system-wide effects of Option 2f, but it suffers from many of the same\nflaws identified in Chavez (e.g., nonrepresentativity and difficulty isolating the\noperative factor). Many of the statistics are limited in scope (e.g., one year of\nACT and AP scores), and those that are not (e.g., SPS) do not clearly support\nLewis’s theory. 23 In addition, the statistical evidence of at-risk-population\nfigures is only inferentially related, at best, to the conditions at the East\nAscension feeder schools. Importantly, the district court observed that Lewis\noffered no evidence of statistical significance at trial, 24 and he makes no\ncolorable argument to the contrary on appeal—nor, for that matter, does he cite\nany case law in support of his contention that his evidence proved\ndiscriminatory impact as a matter of law. Moreover, we agree with the district\ncourt that the expert testimony of Dr. Bates was not specific enough to establish\ndiscriminatory impact. Dr. Bates based his conclusions on general research\nfindings from other school districts and the findings of other experts, and failed\nto evaluate the specific impact of Option 2f on the nonwhite population in the\n\n\n\n\n       23  Lewis makes much of the growing disparity between the SPS attained by East\nAscension, Dutchtown, and St. Amant. However, he fails to account for the recent change to\nthe SPS scale, so it is unclear to what extent the 14.3-point gap between East Ascension and\nDutchtown that prevailed in 2007–2008 differs from the 28.1-point gap between the schools\nin 2012–2013.\n        24 “Statistical significance” refers to a showing that a numerical difference is unlikely\n\nto be the product of chance. See Chavez, 251 F.3d at 642–43. Lewis could demonstrate\nsignificance by showing, for example, that 1) East Ascension feeder zone performance\ndeclined after the implementation of Option 2f, or that the gap between the East Ascension\nfeeder zone performance and other feeder zones’ performances has increased since the\nimplementation of Option 2f, and 2) that such performance variations were unlikely to be\ncaused by random fluctuations from year to year. See id.\n                                              28\n\f     Case: 15-30030   Document: 00513274476       Page: 29   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nEast Ascension feeder zone. This general evidence is insufficient to establish\ndiscriminatory impact as a matter of law.\n       Lewis’s claim of legal error is similarly unavailing. It is true that the\ndistrict court’s discussion could be read to suggest that statistical evidence of\nracial disparities cannot prove discriminatory effect absent evidence of\ndiscriminatory purpose. Indeed, while explaining that “evidence of an increase\nin the percentage of nonwhite and at-risk students at schools in the East\nAscension High School zone, without more, is insufficient to establish disparate\nimpact[,]” the district court cited portions of Feeney and Washington v. Davis,\n426 U.S. 229 (1976), that indicate that a violation of equal protection cannot be\nfounded solely on disparate impact. This construction provides the impetus for\nLewis’s claim that “[t]he ‘more’ referenced by the Trial Court is ‘discriminatory\nintent’ . . . [and] not additional ‘disparate impact.’” However, immediately after\nmaking this pronouncement, the court proceeded to assess the remainder of\nLewis’s evidence of discriminatory effect and it ultimately held that Lewis failed\nto carry his burden to prove a discriminatory impact. Accordingly, viewed in the\ncontext of its entire discussion, the district court’s legal framework is sound, and\nwe affirm its determination on this dispositive issue.\nC.     Lewis’s Other Claims of Error\n       Lewis’s remaining arguments—that the district court erroneously failed\nto consider his racial balancing and de jure segregation arguments—relate to\nclaims not properly before us. In the first appeal, this Court held that Lewis’s\nclaim of racial balancing or racial gerrymandering was not preserved. Lewis,\n662 F.3d at 348 & n.11. The waiver doctrine barred the district court from\nconsidering this claim anew on remand, and it bars this Court’s review now. See\nLindquist v. City of Pasadena, Tex., 669 F.3d 225, 239 (5th Cir. 2012) (“The\nwaiver doctrine holds that an issue that could have been but was not raised on\n\n                                        29\n\f     Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476        Page: 30     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30030\nappeal is forfeited and may not be revisited by the district court on remand. The\ndoctrine also prevents us from considering such an issue during a second\nappeal.” (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted)). As for Lewis’s de jure\nsegregation claim, Lewis never advanced this theory of relief in the district\ncourt, and he correspondingly cannot do so now. See, e.g., Leverette v. Louisville\nLadder Co., 183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam).\nD.     The Appropriate Level of Scrutiny\n       Although the district court did not announce the level of scrutiny it was\napplying to Lewis’s equal protection claim, it may be inferred from the court’s\nsubsidiary rulings that it deemed rational basis review appropriate. When a\ngovernment action is facially race neutral and there is no proof of either\ndiscriminatory purpose or discriminatory effect, that action is subject to rational\nbasis review. See Lewis, 662 F.3d at 348. On rational basis review, the burden\nis on the challenger to rebut the “strong presumption of validity” accorded the\naction and prove that the action is not rationally related to a legitimate\ngovernment purpose. Heller, 509 U.S. at 319–20. We agree with the district\ncourt that rational basis review applies to the funneling aspect of Option 2f and\nthat the plan survives this limited scrutiny. Given that the Board has cited at\nleast one legitimate governmental purpose animating its adoption of Option 2f—\nalleviating overcrowding in the Dutchtown feeder zone 25—and Lewis has made\nno effort to “negative every conceivable basis which might support” the Board’s\naction, id. at 320, we concur in the district court’s conclusion that rational basis\nreview is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n       25 Our sister circuits have treated mitigating school overcrowding and optimizing\nschool utilization as legitimate government purposes. See Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 403; Lower\nMerion, 665 F.3d at 557.\n                                           30\n\fCase: 15-30030   Document: 00513274476    Page: 31   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                           No. 15-30030\n                        IV. CONCLUSION\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 31\n\f",

Discerning no material infirmities in the court’s legal\nconclusions and no clear error in its findings of fact, we affirm the judgment.\n             I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nA.     Factual Background 1\n       The Ascension Parish School District (“the District”) operates four high\nschools in southeast Louisiana—Donaldsonville High School on the west bank\nof the Mississippi River, and East Ascension High School, Dutchtown High\nSchool, 2 and St. Amant High School on the east bank. Since at least 1972, the\nDistrict has assigned students to these schools through an attendance-zone-\nbased “feeder plan,” whereby specified elementary schools “feed” into specified\nmiddle schools, which in turn “feed” into one of the high schools. This\norganization allows students to matriculate together to middle school and high\nschool.\n       In 2004, a federal district court dismissed the District’s longstanding\ndesegregation case and declared the District unitary after finding that all\nvestiges of the prior compulsory dual school system had been eliminated to the\nextent practicable.\n       Later that year, in response to dramatic population growth in the\nDutchtown area, the Board convened a “Growth Impact Committee.” Troy\nGautreau, Sr., a Board member and chairman of the Committee, presented the\nBoard with a “Growth Impact Charter,” which included the following\n“objectives”: (1) “develop a plan to address the growth with minimal impact on\n\n\n       1 The facts of this case were recounted in detail in this Court’s 2011 opinion.

The parties do not\ndispute the essential facts underlying this suit.\n       2 The District constructed Dutchtown High School in 2002 to address the population\n\ngrowth in the Dutchtown area. Correspondingly, that year the District also implemented a\nnew school attendance zone “feeder plan” that included Dutchtown High School.\n                                             2\n\f     Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476         Page: 3     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\nresidents”; (2) “ensure equal facilities and instructional quality for all children”;\n(3) attain “enrollment maximums” established for the elementary, middle, and\nhigh school levels; and (4) “maintain unitary status.” (alterations omitted).\nAccording to then-Superintendent Donald Songy, the District sought to move\napproximately 450 students from Dutchtown Middle School, and thus out of\nDutchtown High School’s feeder zone, to other east bank schools with capacity\nfor growth.\n       To facilitate the Board’s consideration of various rezoning options,\nSuperintendent Songy, Gautreau, and other Board members requested that\nDemographics Application Specialist David Duplechein generate demographic\ndata for several plans. Using the District’s “Edulog” computer program—which\n“geographically code[d] all students actually enrolled in the school system based\non their physical residential addresses”—Duplechein projected the demographic\neffects of various prospective rezoning plans. Ultimately, the Board, which\ngoverns the District, narrowed its consideration down to four rezoning plans,\nreferred to as Options 1, 2, 2f, and 3.\n       Between 2004 and 2007, Gautreau delivered several PowerPoint\npresentations to the Board on the topic of rezoning. In a 2004 presentation,\nGautreau discussed the persistent overcrowding issues in several of the\nDistrict’s primary and middle schools. The presentation indicated that, since\nthe implementation of the 2002 feeder plan that accompanied the construction\nof Dutchtown High School, the percentage of at-risk students 3 at the primary\nand middle schools in the East Ascension High School feeder zone had\nincreased and the average School Performance Scores (“SPS”) 4 at those schools\n\n\n       3 “‘At-risk’ students are those who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch due to\ndisadvantaged socioeconomic status.” Lewis, 662 F.3d at 346 n.7.\n       4 School Performance Scores are calculated according to a formula devised by the\n\nLouisiana Department of Education. They represent a combination of end-of-course test\n                                              3\n\f     Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476         Page: 4    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                      No. 15-30030\nhad decreased. It further highlighted a decline in student enrollment, SPS, and\nstandardized test scores, and an increase in the percentage of at-risk students,\nat East Ascension High School. In addition, the presentation delineated the\nnegative effects of a higher at-risk student population, emphasizing that “the\nconcentration of poverty within a school can be shown to be harmful to all\nstudents in that school whether or not an individual student comes from a poor\nbackground.” It concluded that “a higher percentage of majority students\nshould increase at[-]risk achievement.” It is unclear whether the presentation\nincorporated demographic data derived from Edulog.\n       By 2006, the enrollment of Dutchtown Middle School, a Dutchtown High\nSchool feeder school, had risen to over 1,000 students, causing severe\novercrowding. No other east bank middle school had more than 730 students\nenrolled. Accordingly, in 2006 or 2007 Gautreau prepared another PowerPoint\npresentation that examined Options 2f and 3 in detail. The presentation\ncompared then-current racial demographics at each of the high schools,\nprojected total enrollment at several primary and middle schools, projected\npercentages of “black” and “white” students at several primary and middle\nschools, and projected percentage of “Title I” 5 and “fully paid” students at\nseveral primary and middle schools. It concluded that Option 3 “clearly offers\nthe best opportunity for all students in Ascension Parish and avoids putting\nan undue burden on one particular school by increasing the at[-]risk student\npopulation.” (alteration omitted). As with Gautreau’s 2004 presentation, it is\nunclear whether the 2006–2007 presentation incorporated Edulog data.\n\n\nresults, ACT scores, four-year graduation numbers, and graduation credentials (e.g.,\nadvanced placement courses, entry-based certifications, etc.).\n       5 Title I schools have a high number or a high percentage of students from low-income\n\nfamilies. They derive this name from Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\nof 1965, 20 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq., which authorizes awards of federal financial assistance to\nschools with a qualifying population of low-income students.\n                                             4\n\f     Case: 15-30030      Document: 00513274476        Page: 5     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30030\n      Sometime after 2007, Gautreau created a chart using Edulog data that\nprojected the total enrollment and the percentages of “minority” and at-risk\nstudents at each of the three east bank high schools under each of the rezoning\noptions under consideration. The chart indicated, in relevant part, that: (1)\nunder current conditions, with no redistricting, (a) the enrollment of\nDutchtown High School would increase from 1695 students in 2007 to 2072\nstudents in 2012, a total student population exceeding the 2012 projections at\nEast Ascension High School and St. Amant High School by 700 students and\n400 students, respectively, and (b) the percentage of at-risk students in all\nthree high schools would increase, with the largest jump occurring at East\nAscension High School; and (2) under each of Options 2, 2f, and 3, (a) the total\nenrollment in all three schools would increase but would approach parity, and\n(b) the percentage of at-risk students in all three high schools would increase,\nagain with the largest jump occurring at East Ascension High School. 6\n       In 2008, Superintendent Songy also compiled a chart with Edulog data,\ntitled “Statistical Analysis of Options 1, 2, 2f and 3,” and presented it to the\nBoard for consideration. The chart listed the current enrollment, percentage of\nAfrican–American students, and percentage of at-risk students at each school\nin the district, then projected the enrollment, percentage of African–American\nstudents, and percentage of at-risk students at each school under each of the\nfour rezoning options. Unlike Gautreau’s chart, Songy’s chart did not project\ndata beyond the 2007–2008 school year. Songy’s chart indicated, in relevant\npart, that: (1) the current African-American population at East Ascension High\nSchool exceeded that of the other high schools, but would decrease at East\nAscension High School and would increase at the remaining schools under any\n\n\n      6Notably, Gautreau’s chart seems to replicate the projected demographics of St.\nAmant High School with no redistricting plan in the projections under Options 2, 2f, and 3.\n                                            5\n\f     Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476         Page: 6     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\nplan; (2) the at-risk population at East Ascension High School would decrease\nunder any plan, with the greatest drop under Option 3 and the second greatest\ndrop under Option 2f; (3) the at-risk populations at Dutchtown High School and\nSt. Amant High School would increase under any plan; and (4) the total student\nenrollment would increase at East Ascension High School and St. Amant High\nSchool, but not at Dutchtown High School, under any plan. 7\n       At its January 15, 2008 meeting, Gautreau discussed the School Board’s\nredistricting efforts and, according to the meeting minutes, told the School\nBoard and audience that “the criteria most concentrated on was [sic]\nmaintaining our current unitary status with the Department of Justice and\nmoving the least amount of kids as possible.” Lewis, 662 F.3d at 345. Gautreau\nalso “informed the public that Option 2f or Option 3 needed to be passed by the\nSchool Board that night, and that some people would be upset with the School\nBoard’s decision.” 8 Following remarks by each of the eleven Board members and\nby nineteen members of the public, the Board voted on Options 2f and 3. 9 Option\n3 failed by a vote of six to four, then Option 2f passed by a vote of the same\nmargin, with precisely the same voting blocs on either side. Each Board member\nwas in possession of Songy’s chart at the time of the vote, but it is unclear which\nBoard members, if any, were in possession of Gautreau’s chart or presentations.\nFour of the six Board members who voted in favor of Option 2f testified at the\nbench trial, and each Board member who testified stated that, at the time of the\nvote, they were aware of the demographic projections and of the correlation\nbetween at-risk status and lower academic achievement.\n\n\n\n\n       7  Similarly to Gautreau’s chart, Songy’s chart seems to replicate the same projections\nfor St. Amant High School in each plan.\n        8 Neither party presented evidence to explain Gautreau’s remark.\n        9 Neither party offered a transcript of the Board members’ or the public’s comments.\n\n                                              6\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\n        Option 2f employed several means to shift the student population among\nthe east bank schools. First, it redrew the District’s geographic attendance lines\nso that a number of students were moved from the Dutchtown and St. Amant\nHigh School feeder zones to the East Ascension High School feeder zone. In total,\nOption 2f moved 339 students into different feeder zones during the 2008–2009\nschool year. Second, Option 2f moved Duplessis Primary School, a Title I school,\nfrom the Dutchtown feeder zone to the East Ascension feeder zone. As a result,\nall five of the primary schools in the East Ascension feeder zone were now Title\nI schools. Third, Option 2f assigned one new primary school and one new middle\nschool to the East Ascension feeder zone, two new primary schools to the\nDutchtown feeder zone, and three new primary schools to the St. Amant feeder\nzone.\n        According to data collected by the Louisiana Department of Education,\nsince the implementation of Option 2f, total student enrollment has increased\nat all three east bank high schools; the percentage of at-risk students has\nincreased at all three east bank high schools; and East Ascension High School\nhas maintained the highest percentages of nonwhite students and at-risk\nstudents among the east bank high schools, and those percentages have each\ngrown from 2007 to 2013. In addition, the percentages of both nonwhite\nstudents and at-risk students at each primary school and middle school in the\nEast Ascension feeder zone have increased during this time.\n        Further, it is undisputed that, since the adoption of Option 2f the\nmajority of the District’s nonwhite students and a majority of the District’s at-\nrisk students attend schools in the East Ascension feeder zone; East Ascension\nHigh School is the only majority nonwhite and majority at-risk high school in\nthe District; a majority of the East Ascension feeder schools are majority\nnonwhite, unlike the Dutchtown and St. Amant feeder schools; and all of the\n\n                                        7\n\f     Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476    Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                 No. 15-30030\nEast Ascension feeder schools are majority at-risk, unlike the Dutchtown and\nSt. Amant feeder schools.\n      The evidence of academic performance under Option 2f is mixed. The\naverage ACT score for the 2013 graduating class at East Ascension was 19.4,\nlower than St. Amant’s average score of 20.3 and Dutchtown’s average score of\n21.3, and lower than the state’s average score of 19.5, but average ACT scores\nalso declined for all three schools during this time. Additionally, Dutchtown and\nSt. Amant high school students performed better than East Ascension students\non Advanced Placement (“AP”) exams in the 2011-2012 academic year.\nDutchtown also attained superior SPS to East Ascension High School, both\nbefore and after the implementation of Option 2f. In the 2007–2008 school year,\nEast Ascension’s SPS was 95.1, compared to Dutchtown’s SPS of 109.8. In the\n2012–2013 school year—after the Department of Education revised the SPS\nscale from 150 points to 200 points—East Ascension’s SPS was 135.2, compared\nto Dutchtown’s SPS of 163.3 and St. Amant’s SPS of 149.7. On the other hand,\nEast Ascension’s SPS has gradually increased since the implementation of\nOption 2f, and its state school ranking and graduation rate are now at all-time\nhighs.\nB.    Procedural Background\n      1.    The Suit\n      Shortly after the adoption of Option 2f, Lewis, the father of two African–\nAmerican schoolchildren assigned to the East Ascension feeder zone both pre-\nand post-Option 2f, filed suit against the Board in Louisiana state court. Lewis,\n662 F.3d at 345. Lewis sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, asserting violations of his\nchildren’s Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection. Id. at 346. He\nessentially raised two challenges to Option 2f: first, he alleged that the Board\nadopted Option 2f “to ensure that East Ascension High School [and its feeder\n\n                                       8\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476        Page: 9   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nschools] would maintain a disproportionately large non-white minority\npopulation, leaving the remaining two East Bank schools as predominantly\nwhite” (the “racial balancing” claim), id. (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); and second, he alleged that because Option 2f placed\na disproportionate number of at-risk students in the East Ascension feeder\nzone, “Option 2f ‘would ensure that the nonwhite minority students at East\nAscension High School [and in its feeder system] would not, now and in the\nfuture, be afforded educational opportunities equal to those available to the\nstudents at either Dutchtown High School or St. Amant High School” (the\n“funneling” claim), id. (alteration in original).\n      The Board removed the action to federal court and successfully moved\nfor summary judgment. Id. The district court found Option 2f facially race\nneutral and concluded that Lewis had not presented competent evidence of\nboth discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect so as to invoke strict\nscrutiny. Id. It then upheld the plan on rational basis review because the Board\nhad a legitimate government interest in reducing overcrowding. Id.\n      2.    The First Appeal\n      A divided panel of this Court reversed. Id. at 352. The Court held, first,\nthat Lewis’s racial-balancing claim was not preserved and that Lewis’s only\nlive claims were his funneling claim and his claim that Option 2f employs\nexplicit racial classifications. Id. at 348 & n.11. It then criticized the district\ncourt’s analysis, which relied in part on evidence that the Board “considered\n[the race of reassigned students] in an effort at maintaining the racial balance\nalready existing among the schools in East Ascension Parish and in\nmaintaining the school district’s unitary status, not as part of a racially\ndiscriminatory motive to allocate a ‘disproportionate number’ of African–\nAmerican students to the East Ascension school zone.” Id. at 349. The Court\n\n                                         9\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476      Page: 10    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30030\nraised two concerns with this reasoning: first, “it is unclear how, on the record\nbefore us, the court could make a factual finding as a matter of law about the\nBoard’s lack of discriminatory purpose”; and second, “the court’s assumption\nthat it might be justifiable to use racially-based decisions for the ‘benign’\npurpose of maintaining post-unitary ‘racial balance’ among the schools in the\nsystem is at least in tension with the Supreme Court’s decision in Parents\nInvolved.” Id.\n      The Court then identified several pieces of evidence that created a\ngenuine issue of material fact concerning the Board’s discriminatory purpose.\nId. at 350–52. First, the Court cited the Board’s reliance on Edulog data, noting\nthat Edulog “coded each enrolled student in order to predict the ‘statistical\neffects’ of Option 2f’s boundary assignments” and that, in turn, “it is unclear\nhow a student assignment plan could calculate the percentage of black\nstudents at each school without classifying individual students by race.” Id. at\n350. The Court rejected the Board’s explanation “that the Statistical Analysis\nunderlying Option 2f . . . does not constitute Option 2f itself” because “to accept\nthat self-serving, summary allegation would be to allow a school district to\nskew reality by selectively including documents in the record and labeling only\nthose documents its ‘plan.’” Id. This, the Court said, it could not countenance\non review of a summary judgment. Id.\n      Next, the Court quoted the testimony of Superintendent Songy and\nvarious Board members that “suggest[ed] that the District relied upon the race\nof the individual students residing in different geographic locations when it re-\nzoned its schools.” Id. at 350–51. The Court also cited an excerpt from the\nDistrict’s website that referred to “alter[ing] the racial balance” and\n“balanc[ing] the demograph[ics]” at East Ascension. Id. at 351 (second\nalteration in original). In response to the district court’s finding that “‘only’ 339\n\n                                         10\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476           Page: 11     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30030\nstudents, in a district population of 18,000, were affected by Option 2f,” the\nCourt observed that, “[i]n light of the testimony, this seems to be a group\nidentifiable and identified principally on racial grounds (whether minority or\nnot) for assignment to particular schools.” Id.\n       Lastly, the Court concluded that there were material questions of fact\nsurrounding the discriminatory effect of Option 2f. Id. Criticizing the district\ncourt for basing its finding on a statistical analysis of Option 2f’s impact on\nonly the east bank high schools, the Court pointed out that Lewis alleged a\ndiscriminatory effect on the East Ascension feeder system. Id. The statistics in\nthe record, the Court said, “provide some support” for Lewis’s funneling claim.\nId. at 352. The Court gave particular attention to statistics showing disparities\nbetween the percentage of the total east bank student population enrolled in\neach feeder system and the percentage of the east bank’s total at-risk student\npopulation and total nonwhite student population in each feeder system. Id. at\n351–52. 10 In any event, the Court declined to identify the pertinent standard\nof review, holding that the determination of whether to apply strict scrutiny or\nrational basis review “turns on the factual questions of discriminatory motive\nand impact.” Id. at 352.\n       3.      Remand, Pretrial Motions, and the Bench Trial\n       On remand, the district court permitted additional discovery; then both\nparties moved for summary judgment. The district court denied Lewis’s motion\nand granted in part and denied in part the Board’s motion. Two aspects of the\ndistrict court’s ruling are relevant here.

There is no mention of these statistics in Lewis’s post-trial\nbriefing or in his appellate briefs.\n                                               11\n\f    Case: 15-30030      Document: 00513274476     Page: 12   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nthat the School Board’s consideration of projected racial and socioeconomic\ndata prior to voting does not amount to a racial classification.” It\ncorrespondingly denied “Lewis’[s] request that the Court review Option 2f\nunder strict scrutiny on this basis” and granted “[t]he School Board’s request\nthat the Court dismiss Lewis’[s] claim that Option 2f employs a racial\nclassification.” Second, the district court denied “the School Board’s request\nthat the Court dismiss Lewis’[s] remaining Equal Protection claim on th[e]\nbasis” that “Lewis cannot establish that [his children] were treated differently\nthan similarly situated students of a different race”—namely, white students\nin the Dutchtown and St. Amant feeder zones. Despite announcing that it was\n“unable to consider all of the evidence presented until after a full trial on the\nmerits,” the district court “conclude[d],” based on “the evidence presented here,\n[the] context of this matter, and factors considered by the School Board when\nit adopted Option 2f,” that the plaintiff’s children “are, in fact, similarly\nsituated to white students in the Dutchtown High School and St. Amant High\nSchool feeder zones.”\n      The case proceeded to a three-day bench trial. At the opening of the trial,\nthe Board orally requested that the district court reconsider several of its rulings\nin its summary-judgment order, including its conclusion on the “similarly\nsituated” issue. The district court denied the Board’s requests without prejudice\nto the Board’s right to reurge them in its post-trial briefs. Lewis made no request\nthat the district court reconsider its ruling that Option 2f did not employ racial\nclassifications.\n      At trial, Lewis called ten witnesses: five members of the Board who voted\non Option 2f, Demographics Application Specialist Duplechein, Lewis, Lewis’s\nson, Bridget Thomas (a “concerned parent” who compiled statistics on the\nrezoning options), and Dr. Percy Bates (an expert witness in educational\n\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476       Page: 13   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\npsychology). The Board, in turn, called two witnesses: Patrice Pujol, current\nSuperintendent of the Board, and former Superintendent Songy.\n      Following post-trial briefing, the district court issued Rule 52 findings of\nfact and conclusions of law. The court’s findings of fact are summarized in Part\nI(A), supra. The court opened its conclusions of law with a summary of Lewis’s\ntheory:\n     “Here, the gravamen of Lewis’s section 1983 claim is that the School\n     Board has denied nonwhite students in the East Ascension High\n     School attendance zone equal educational opportunities, in\n     violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, by adopting a school\n     rezoning plan that ‘feeds’ a disproportionate number of at-risk\n     students into the East Ascension High School attendance zone.”\nThe court then held that: (1) Option 2f does not employ explicit racial\nclassifications, (2) Lewis failed to prove that nonwhite students in the East\nAscension attendance zone are similarly situated to white students in the\nDutchtown and St. Amant attendance zones, and, in turn, that Option 2f accords\ndisparate treatment to similarly situated students of a different race, and (3)\neven if Lewis had proven that Option 2f treats similarly situated students\ndifferently on the basis of race, the record evidence does not support the\nconclusion that Option 2f has had a discriminatory effect on nonwhite students\nin the East Ascension feeder zone. Accordingly, the court omitted discussion of\nwhether the Board acted with a discriminatory purpose. In addition, the court\ndid not identify the level of scrutiny it would apply to Lewis’s challenge to Option\n2f; it held only that “Lewis has not satisfied his burden of proving by a\npreponderance of the evidence that [the Board’s] adoption of Option 2f violates\nthe Equal Protection Clause.” Lewis timely appealed.\n\n\n            II.

The Sixth Circuit resolved this ambiguity by crediting the Lewis dissent\nand observing that “if the court majority had truly believed that there was racial\nclassification at play, it would have ordered the district court on remand to subject the\nchallenged policy to strict scrutiny, which it did not do.” Id. at 395–96. Moreover, the Spurlock\ncourt remarked, “to the extent that certain statements in Lewis conflict with Supreme Court\nprecedent, the latter obviously prevails.” Id. at 396.\n                                                19\n\f    Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476      Page: 20    Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nand to rely on that classification in determining school assignments is subject to\nstrict scrutiny.” Lewis’s position hinges on the premise that Option 2f is more\nthan the maps and written descriptions laying out the geographic boundaries of\nthe feeder zones; in his view, the demographic analysis underlying Option 2f\nclassifies students on the basis of race, and this data, as well as the race-\nconscious motives of the Board members, evince express racial classifications in\nthe plan.\n      The Board counters that the district court correctly looked only to the\nface of Option 2f to assess its race neutrality, and it contends that the court’s\nfinding that none of the documents that make up Option 2f include any\nreference to race is not clearly erroneous. The Board urges this Court to follow\nthe Third and Sixth Circuits and hold that a school zoning plan that assigns\nstudents to schools based on their home addresses is facially race neutral, and\nthe rezoning body’s consideration of demographic data in drawing the relevant\ngeographic boundaries does not amount to making an express classification.\nLastly, the Board posits that even if Option 2f incorporated Gautreau’s or\nSongy’s statistical analysis, the plan would still not contain any express racial\nclassifications because there is no provision that “identif[ies] any classification\nby individual student or group for purposes of school assignment” or that\n“require[s] the consideration of race when enrolling students in any school.”\n      We agree with the Board and find no error in the district court’s ruling\nthat Option 2f contains no explicit racial classifications. Lewis provides no basis\nfor this Court to conclude that the district court’s factual finding that Option 2f\nis facially race neutral and assigns students to schools on the sole basis of\ngeography is clearly erroneous. The only evidence he points to on appeal relates\nto the Board’s awareness of racial demographics and its alleged desire to\nmaintain the District’s unitary status through racial balancing. Under the\n\n                                        20\n\f     Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476            Page: 21      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                          No. 15-30030\nSupreme Court’s electoral-redistricting precedents, and consistent with the\nThird and Sixth Circuit’s reasoning, this evidence has no bearing on the facial\nneutrality of the Board’s action—at least absent evidence that the geographic\nboundaries are explicable only as the product of intentional segregation, see\nMiller, 515 U.S. at 914; see also supra note 16; cf. Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 394;\nLower Merion, 665 F.3d at 548. Even accepting Lewis’s position that Option 2f\nincorporated the demographic data and projections, this does not establish that\nthe plan explicitly classified students by race; it shows only that the Board\nconsidered the same sort of data that the Supreme Court has refused to equate\nto a facial racial classification, albeit in the electoral context. 18 See Bush, 517\nU.S. at 958; Miller, 515 U.S. at 916; Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646. It also does not\nbring the plan within the ambit of Parents Involved, as that case addressed\nindividualized student assignments that took into account the student’s race\nand the overall racial makeup of the school. See supra note 13.\n       Likewise, the district court’s legal conclusion that the Board’s\nconsideration of demographic data in formulating Option 2f “does not amount to\n[adopting] a rezoning plan that assigns students on the basis of race” conforms\nto Supreme Court case law, see, e.g., Bush, 517 U.S. at 958, and is in accord with\nthe decisions of this Court’s sister circuits, see Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 394; Lower\nMerion, 665 F.3d at 548. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err\nin concluding that Option 2f does not make express racial classifications and so\nis not subject to strict scrutiny on that basis.\nB.     The Discriminatory Purpose and Effect of Option 2f\n\n\n\n\n       18  Lewis has not argued that Option 2f’s boundaries are so “bizarre” or “highly\nirregular” that, on its face, the plan “rationally cannot be understood as anything other than\nan effort to segregat[e] . . . on the basis of race.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 914 (alteration in original)\n(quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646–47) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n                                                 21\n\f    Case: 15-30030    Document: 00513274476      Page: 22   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\n      Lewis next contends that the district court erred in rejecting his\nalternative theory that, despite Option 2f’s facial neutrality, the redistricting\nplan’s funneling feature is nevertheless subject to strict scrutiny because it had\nboth a discriminatory purpose and a discriminatory effect. See Vill. of Arlington\nHeights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109573\"><a href=\"/opinion/109573/arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264–66 (1977) (holding that\nan equal protection claim premised on an outwardly neutral law requires proof\nof both a discriminatory effect and a discriminatory purpose). Relevant to this\ndetermination, the district court first found that the pertinent comparator group\nfor Lewis’s equal protection claim was white students within the East Ascension\nfeeder zone—not white students in the other feeder zones, as it had originally\nruled on post-remand summary judgment. It then found that, even if Lewis had\nsuccessfully established that nonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder\nzone were similarly situated to their white counterparts in the other feeder\nzones, he had not proven that Option 2f had a discriminatory adverse effect on\nnonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder zone. Lewis urges that the\ndistrict court erred in both regards.\n      Because we resolve the district court’s treatment of Lewis’s alternative\nequal protection theory on the discriminatory-effect finding, we need not\naddress either the court’s similarly situated finding or Lewis’s proffered\nevidence of discriminatory purpose.

On one hand, there is general agreement that a finding of\ndiscriminatory effect is a finding of fact subject to review for clear error. 20 On\nthe other hand, there is authority for the proposition that where, as here, the\nfacts are essentially undisputed, the question of whether those facts evince a\ndiscriminatory effect is ultimately one of law that this Court reviews de novo. 21\n\n\n\n       19  We note that there is uncertainty in the law regarding the circumstances under\nwhich an equal protection plaintiff alleging racial discrimination is required to identify a\nsimilarly situated comparator group and the showing required to discharge this burden. See\ngenerally Giovanna Shay, Similarly Situated, 18 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 581 (2011). Although\nthe Third Circuit in Lower Merion conducted a similarly situated analysis—which informed\nthe district court’s analysis in this case—it did so without citation to authority. See 665 F.3d\nat 550. Moreover, Lower Merion addressed a different type of claim—that “targeting” a\nparticular area for redistricting “in part because that Community has one of the highest\nconcentrations of African–American students in the District” violates the Equal Protection\nClause, 665 F.3d at 540—and it grounded its similarly situated analysis in relevant part on\nevidence that the redistricting affected both white and nonwhite students in the “targeted\narea,” id. at 550. Not only does this formulation of the inquiry seem to preclude a finding of\ndisparate treatment, but it does not neatly track Lewis’s novel funneling theory. Accordingly,\nwe express no view on the district court’s treatment of this issue and merely assume without\ndeciding that Lewis proved that the nonwhite students in the East Ascension feeder zone are\nsimilarly situated to white students in the other feeder zones, as his theory of discrimination\npresumes.\n        20 See, e.g., Ortiz v.

As relevant here, the court cited the absence of evidence\nof the total number of field reports prepared (or even the number analyzed by\nthe plaintiffs) and the lack of an adequate population benchmark against which\nto measure whether the plaintiffs’ racial groups were stopped at a rate\ndisproportionate to their representation in the driving population.

To establish the discriminatory effect of the rezoning plan, the\nplaintiffs relied exclusively on the testimony of a single witness. Id. at 88.

Further, the plaintiffs declined to\n“engage in any systemwide analysis of the racial impact” of the plan, resting\n\n                                        25\n\f    Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476      Page: 26   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                   No. 15-30030\ninstead on the “individual examples of the racial effect” evident in the witness’s\ncharts. Id. The First Circuit held this evidence insufficient to show\ndiscriminatory effect—and, as a corollary, discriminatory purpose inferable\nfrom a gross statistical disparity. Id.\n      Here, the district court held that Lewis’s proffered evidence failed to\nestablish that Option 2f worked a discriminatory effect on nonwhite students in\nthe East Ascension feeder zone by funneling a disproportionate number of at-\nrisk students to their schools. Even accepting the undisputed evidence that the\npercentage of at-risk students in the East Ascension feeder zone increased after\nthe implementation of Option 2f, the court found that this was insufficient,\nstanding alone, to carry Lewis’s burden. The court found that the objective\nevidence of student performance adduced at trial—ACT scores, SPS, and AP\nclasses and exam results—was unpersuasive. Lewis only offered average ACT\nscores for a single year; although the scores placed East Ascension 0.1 point\nbelow the state average, 0.9 point below St. Amant, and 1.9 points below\nDutchtown, these results were neither broadly representative of student\nperformance nor relevant to the educational experiences of students in the East\nAscension feeder zone’s primary and middle schools. East Ascension High\nSchool’s SPS had “gradually increased since the implementation of Option 2f,”\nand although it was outpaced by Dutchtown’s and St. Amant’s SPS—by 28.1\npoints and 14.5 points, respectively—“Lewis failed to introduce evidence to\nestablish that these differences are statistically significant, or that such\ndifferences are the result of unequal educational opportunities[.]” The AP scores\nwere similarly unavailing: Lewis presented evidence of inferior performance by\nEast Ascension High School students in one academic year, but he again failed\nto establish statistical significance. And, as with the ACT scores, the SPS and\nAP performance related only to East Ascension High School and not its feeders.\n\n                                          26\n\f    Case: 15-30030       Document: 00513274476          Page: 27     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 15-30030\n       Finally, the court rejected the opinion of Lewis’s expert, Dr. Percy Bates,\nas “meaningless.” Although Dr. Bates was qualified as “an expert on the impact\nof a disproportionate number of at-risk students on an academic environment,”\nhe based his expert report solely on “the general research findings of other\nexperts, student performance scores from 2006 and 2007, iLEAP test scores\nfrom 2006 and 2007, and Gautreau’s projections.” 22 He claimed that his opinion\nwas confirmed—and, indeed, strengthened—by the evidence he observed at\ntrial, but he conceded that he had not considered any post-Option 2f data in\nrendering his opinion in the first instance. In particular, he acknowledged that\nhe had not researched the quality of instruction or the course offerings in the\nEast Ascension schools relative to their counterparts in the other feeder zones,\nhe had not interviewed Lewis’s children, and he had not done any calculations\nof the actual effect of Option 2f on the at-risk population. As for Dr. Bates’s\n“research findings in other districts” and his consideration of “the general\nresearch findings of other experts,” the court noted that this research could be\n“instructive,” but “his failure to conduct an independent analysis in this case\nrenders his opinion meaningless.”\n       Lewis essentially makes two arguments on appeal. First, he contends\nthat the objective evidence of student performance he presented at trial,\ncoupled with Dr. Bates’s expert testimony, proved as a matter of law that\nOption 2f’s funneling caused a disproportionate adverse effect on the nonwhite\npopulation in the East Ascension feeder zone. Second, he asserts that the\ndistrict court committed legal error by faulting him for failing to prove\ndiscriminatory purpose, despite the court declining to reach that issue in the\nfirst instance.\n\n\n       22Notably, the district court observed that Lewis failed to introduce Dr. Bates’s expert\nreport into the trial record.\n                                              27\n\f    Case: 15-30030        Document: 00513274476          Page: 28      Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                        No. 15-30030\n       We find that Lewis failed to prove as a matter of law that Option 2f’s\nfunneling feature had a racially discriminatory effect. Lewis’s statistical\nevidence is stronger than that offered in Anderson, as it at least offers a glance\nat the system-wide effects of Option 2f, but it suffers from many of the same\nflaws identified in Chavez (e.g., nonrepresentativity and difficulty isolating the\noperative factor). Many of the statistics are limited in scope (e.g., one year of\nACT and AP scores), and those that are not (e.g., SPS) do not clearly support\nLewis’s theory. 23 In addition, the statistical evidence of at-risk-population\nfigures is only inferentially related, at best, to the conditions at the East\nAscension feeder schools. Importantly, the district court observed that Lewis\noffered no evidence of statistical significance at trial, 24 and he makes no\ncolorable argument to the contrary on appeal—nor, for that matter, does he cite\nany case law in support of his contention that his evidence proved\ndiscriminatory impact as a matter of law. Moreover, we agree with the district\ncourt that the expert testimony of Dr. Bates was not specific enough to establish\ndiscriminatory impact. Dr. Bates based his conclusions on general research\nfindings from other school districts and the findings of other experts, and failed\nto evaluate the specific impact of Option 2f on the nonwhite population in the\n\n\n\n\n       23  Lewis makes much of the growing disparity between the SPS attained by East\nAscension, Dutchtown, and St. Amant. However, he fails to account for the recent change to\nthe SPS scale, so it is unclear to what extent the 14.3-point gap between East Ascension and\nDutchtown that prevailed in 2007–2008 differs from the 28.1-point gap between the schools\nin 2012–2013.\n        24 “Statistical significance” refers to a showing that a numerical difference is unlikely\n\nto be the product of chance. See Chavez, 251 F.3d at 642–43. Lewis could demonstrate\nsignificance by showing, for example, that 1) East Ascension feeder zone performance\ndeclined after the implementation of Option 2f, or that the gap between the East Ascension\nfeeder zone performance and other feeder zones’ performances has increased since the\nimplementation of Option 2f, and 2) that such performance variations were unlikely to be\ncaused by random fluctuations from year to year. See id.\n                                              28\n\f     Case: 15-30030   Document: 00513274476       Page: 29   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                  No. 15-30030\nEast Ascension feeder zone. This general evidence is insufficient to establish\ndiscriminatory impact as a matter of law.\n       Lewis’s claim of legal error is similarly unavailing. It is true that the\ndistrict court’s discussion could be read to suggest that statistical evidence of\nracial disparities cannot prove discriminatory effect absent evidence of\ndiscriminatory purpose. Indeed, while explaining that “evidence of an increase\nin the percentage of nonwhite and at-risk students at schools in the East\nAscension High School zone, without more, is insufficient to establish disparate\nimpact[,]” the district court cited portions of Feeney and Washington v. Davis,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), that indicate that a violation of equal protection cannot be\nfounded solely on disparate impact. This construction provides the impetus for\nLewis’s claim that “[t]he ‘more’ referenced by the Trial Court is ‘discriminatory\nintent’ . . . [and] not additional ‘disparate impact.’” However, immediately after\nmaking this pronouncement, the court proceeded to assess the remainder of\nLewis’s evidence of discriminatory effect and it ultimately held that Lewis failed\nto carry his burden to prove a discriminatory impact. Accordingly, viewed in the\ncontext of its entire discussion, the district court’s legal framework is sound, and\nwe affirm its determination on this dispositive issue.\nC.     Lewis’s Other Claims of Error\n       Lewis’s remaining arguments—that the district court erroneously failed\nto consider his racial balancing and de jure segregation arguments—relate to\nclaims not properly before us. In the first appeal, this Court held that Lewis’s\nclaim of racial balancing or racial gerrymandering was not preserved. Lewis,\n662 F.3d at 348 & n.11. The waiver doctrine barred the district court from\nconsidering this claim anew on remand, and it bars this Court’s review now. See\nLindquist v. City of Pasadena, Tex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"621520\"><a href=\"/opinion/621520/lindquist-v-city-of-pasadena-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239 (5th Cir. 2012) (“The\nwaiver doctrine holds that an issue that could have been but was not raised on\n\n                                        29\n\f     Case: 15-30030     Document: 00513274476        Page: 30     Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                                     No. 15-30030\nappeal is forfeited and may not be revisited by the district court on remand. The\ndoctrine also prevents us from considering such an issue during a second\nappeal.” (footnote and internal quotation marks omitted)). As for Lewis’s de jure\nsegregation claim, Lewis never advanced this theory of relief in the district\ncourt, and he correspondingly cannot do so now. See, e.g., Leverette v. Louisville\nLadder Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"18310\"><a href=\"/opinion/18310/leverette-v-louisville-ladder-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">339</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (5th Cir. 1999) (per curiam).\nD.     The Appropriate Level of Scrutiny\n       Although the district court did not announce the level of scrutiny it was\napplying to Lewis’s equal protection claim, it may be inferred from the court’s\nsubsidiary rulings that it deemed rational basis review appropriate. When a\ngovernment action is facially race neutral and there is no proof of either\ndiscriminatory purpose or discriminatory effect, that action is subject to rational\nbasis review. See Lewis, 662 F.3d at 348. On rational basis review, the burden\nis on the challenger to rebut the “strong presumption of validity” accorded the\naction and prove that the action is not rationally related to a legitimate\ngovernment purpose. Heller, 509 U.S. at 319–20. We agree with the district\ncourt that rational basis review applies to the funneling aspect of Option 2f and\nthat the plan survives this limited scrutiny. Given that the Board has cited at\nleast one legitimate governmental purpose animating its adoption of Option 2f—\nalleviating overcrowding in the Dutchtown feeder zone 25—and Lewis has made\nno effort to “negative every conceivable basis which might support” the Board’s\naction, id. at 320, we concur in the district court’s conclusion that rational basis\nreview is satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n       25 Our sister circuits have treated mitigating school overcrowding and optimizing\nschool utilization as legitimate government purposes. See Spurlock, 716 F.3d at 403; Lower\nMerion, 665 F.3d at 557.\n                                           30\n\fCase: 15-30030   Document: 00513274476    Page: 31   Date Filed: 11/17/2015\n\n\n\n\n                           No. 15-30030\n                        IV. CONCLUSION\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                 31\n\f</pre>",
