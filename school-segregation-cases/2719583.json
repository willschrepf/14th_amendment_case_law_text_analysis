Morton, Jr.; and Christine A. Morton, Individually\n           and as next friend of Robert A. Morton, III, Rebecca E. Morton, and\n                     Charles G. Morton, Minor Children, Appellants\n\n                                                v.\n\n             County of Travis and Lower Colorado River Authority, Appellees\n\n\n\n\n    FROM THE DISTRICT COURT OF TRAVIS COUNTY, 201ST JUDICIAL DISTRICT\n     NO. 95-11383, HONORABLE CHARLES F. CAMPBELL, JR., JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n\n               The question presented is whether county park rules that ban children’s access to a\n\nclothing-optional park violate the United States and Texas Constitutions. See U.S. Const. amend.\n\nI, XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27. Central Texas Nudists, Robert A. Morton, Jr., and\n\nChristine A. Morton, individually and as next friend of Robert A. Morton, III, Rebecca E. Morton,\n\nand Charles G. Morton, minor children (collectively, “appellants”) filed suit against Travis County\n\nand the Lower Colorado River Authority, seeking a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive\n\nrelief. This appeal arises from a judgment denying appellants’ motion for summary judgment and\n\ngranting the motions for summary judgment of Travis County and the Lower Colorado River\n\nAuthority. We affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n                                             FACTS\n\f                 McGregor Park1 is a public park owned by the Lower Colorado River Authority and\n\nsituated on Lake Travis in Travis County. The county has managed McGregor Park since the 1980s\n\nwhen it leased the park from the Lower Colorado River Authority. In 1995, Travis County\n\npromulgated two park rules for McGregor Park, which were adopted by the Commissioners Court\n\nof Travis County. Recognizing that nude sunbathing occurs in the park, the Commissioners (1)\n\nrestricted access to the park to persons over the age of eighteen and (2) directed:\n\n\n          Any authorization or consent to the nude display of children and the nude display of\n          adults with children present under the age of eighteen in this park will be treated as\n          a violation of the law and park rules. Violators and parties to such violations will be\n          investigated and prosecuted if possible.\n\n\nBecause appellants are “naturists” who believe that engaging in nude social activities with their\n\nchildren instills values of body acceptance and other naturist values, they contend that these new rules\n\ninfringe on their constitutional rights of, inter alia, freedom of expression and privacy, by prohibiting\n\ntheir children from accompanying them to the park.\n\n                 After considering each party’s motion for summary judgment, the district court\n\ngranted the motions filed by Travis County and the Lower Colorado River Authority and denied\n\nappellants’ motion.\n\n                                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                 Because the propriety of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment and the\n\nconstitutionality of a rule raise questions of law, we review these matters de novo. Texas Med. Liab.\n\nTrust v. Zurich Ins. Co., 945 S.W.2d 839, 842 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, writ denied); Armbrister\n\n\n\n   1\n       McGregor Park is also known locally as Hippie Hollow.\n\n                                                    2\n\fv. Morales, 943 S.W.2d 202, 205 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997, no writ) (citing Barber v. Colorado\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 901 S.W.2d 447, 450 (Tex. 1995)). The proper inquiry on appeal is whether the\n\ndefendant, in seeking summary judgment, fulfilled its initial burden of establishing that no genuine\n\nissue of material fact exists and that judgment should be granted as a matter of law. City of Houston\n\nv. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 675-79 (Tex. 1979). Evidence is viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to the non-movant. Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d 546, 548-49 (Tex.\n\n1985). Similarly, all reasonable inferences are indulged and any doubts resolved in favor of the non-\n\nmovant. Id. at 549.\n\n               When each party has filed a motion for summary judgment and the district court has\n\ngranted one motion while denying another, we review the summary judgment proof presented by each\n\nparty, determine all questions presented, and “render such judgment as the trial court should have\n\nrendered.” Commissioners Court v. Agan, 940 S.W.2d 77, 80 (Tex. 1997). “[W]hen there are\n\nmultiple grounds for summary judgment and the order does not specify the ground on which the\n\nsummary judgment was granted, the appealing party must negate all grounds on appeal.” State Farm\n\nFire & Cas. Co. v. S.S. & G.W., 858 S.W.2d 374, 381 (Tex. 1993); accord Carr v. Brasher, 776\n\nS.W.2d 567, 569 (Tex. 1989). If the appellant fails to negate each ground on which the judgment\n\nmay have been rendered, we must uphold the summary judgment. See Carr, 776 S.W.2d at 569.\n\n               In this case, each party filed a motion for summary judgment and the district court\n\ngranted appellees’ motions. Because the trial court did not specify the grounds on which it rendered\n\njudgment, we must affirm the judgment if any of the grounds advanced in the motions are\n\nmeritorious.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f                                           DISCUSSION\n\n               In their first issue, appellants challenge the constitutionality of the two Travis County\n\npark rules, contending that they are facially invalid. See U.S. Const. amend. I, XIV; Tex. Const. art.\n\nI, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27. 2 Constitutional claims must be examined by looking at the rights of the class of\n\npeople who are being excluded from a particular activity. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,\n\n473 U.S. 432, 439 (1985). Here, both rules exclude individuals under eighteen years of age from\n\nentering McGregor Park.\n\n               Appellants assert that the park rules violate naturist families’ right to equal protection\n\nunder the United States Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellants argue that by prohibiting\n\nminor children from entering the park, even when accompanied by their parents, the rules distinguish\n\nbetween classes of individuals on the basis of whether minor children accompany them to McGregor\n\nPark.\n\n               The Equal Protection Clause requires that all similarly situated persons be treated\n\nalike. Id. Courts perform an equal protection inquiry “if the challenged government action classifies\n\nor distinguishes between two or more relevant groups.” Qutb v. Strauss, 11 F.3d 488, 492 (5th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n  2\n        Appellants assert arguments based on their rights to equal protection, privacy, substantive due\nprocess, and freedom of expression and of association under the Texas Constitution. See Tex. Const.\nart. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27. With respect to their privacy and substantive due process arguments,\nappellants direct our attention to several Texas cases, which acknowledge a parent’s fundamental\nright to direct the upbringing of a child. See, e.g., In re Doe 5, 19 S.W.3d 346, 376 (Tex. 2000)\n(Hecht, J., dissenting); Patterson v. Planned Parenthood, 971 S.W.2d 439, 447 (Tex. 1998)\n(Gonzalez, J., concurring); In re J.W.T., 872 S.W.2d 189, 194-95 (Tex. 1994); Wiley v. Spartlan,\n543 S.W.2d 349, 352 (Tex. 1976). Our review of these opinions, however, reveals no discussion\nimplicating the Texas Constitution. We decline to address the issues raised by appellant under the\nTexas Constitution because appellants’ briefs have not provided argument or citations to authorities\nto support these arguments. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(h).\n\n                                                   4\n\f1993). Because the rules treat two groups of individuals differently, we must subject both rules to\n\nan equal protection inquiry.\n\n                  The first step of this inquiry requires us to determine what burden of justification must\n\nbe satisfied by looking at the interests affected. Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U.S. 374, 383 (1978).\n\nWhen a law affects individuals in a suspect classification differently or implicates a fundamental right,\n\nthe law must be examined under a strict scrutiny analysis. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-17\n\n(1982); San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 40 (1973). Appellants do not argue\n\nthat these rules treat persons in a suspect classification differently. For the strict scrutiny test to apply\n\nhere, we must conclude that these rules implicate a fundamental right.\n\n                  Appellants first assert that the park rules interfere with their fundamental right to direct\n\nthe upbringing of their children. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); Meyer v.\n\nNebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923). Appellants characterize the rights at issue as involving an\n\nindividual’s personal choice in matters of family life. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479,\n\n482-84 (1965). Appellants further contend that a parent’s right to raise a child free of state\n\ninterference is within the constitutional protection of privacy secured by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nSee id. at 484.\n\n                  Appellants also direct our attention to the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Troxel\n\nv. Granville, asserting that it supports their position. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S. Ct.\n\n2054 (2000). In Troxel, the Court considered a state statute that permitted any person, including a\n\ngrandparent, to petition for visitation rights at any time. Id. at 2057. The Court affirmed the state\n\nsupreme court’s holdings that “‘parents have a right to limit visitation of their children with third\n\npersons’” and that “between parents and judges, ‘the parents should be the ones to choose whether\n\n\n                                                      5\n\fto expose their children to certain people or ideas.’” Id. at 2059 (quoting In re Smith, 969 P.2d 21,\n\n31 (Wash. 1998), aff’d sub nom, Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 120 S. Ct. 2054 (2000)). We read\n\nTroxel as affirming a parent’s right to direct the upbringing of a child. Id. at 2059-60 (“[T]he Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right of parents to make\n\ndecisions concerning care, custody, and control of their children.”).\n\n               But these parental rights are not absolute. See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U.S.\n\n651 (1977) (no parental right to demand approval before corporal punishment is inflicted by public\n\nschool teachers and administrators); Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976) (no\n\nparental right to veto a minor’s decision to terminate a pregnancy); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.\n\n160 (1976) (no parental right to educate children in private segregated academies); Kite v. Marshall,\n\n661 F.2d 1027 (5th Cir. 1981) (no parental right to send children to summer athletic camps). In Kite\n\nv. Marshall, the Fifth Circuit expressly acknowledged that “parental authority falls short of being\n\nconstitutionally absolute.” Kite, 661 F.2d at 1029. The court further opined that these cases\n\nexemplify circumstances in which “the Supreme Court refrained from clothing parental judgment with\n\na constitutional mantle.” Id.\n\n               While we agree with appellants’ contentions that the Fourteenth Amendment\n\nencompasses a general right to direct the upbringing of children, we do not agree that these park rules\n\nimpede that right. Neither rule prohibits appellants from raising their children according to the\n\nnaturist philosophy. Rather, the rules impose a restriction on where the practice of this philosophy\n\nmay occur by establishing an age restriction for admittance to McGregor Park that applies to all\n\nfamilies, whether naturist or not. Consequently, we reject appellants’ arguments based on the rights\n\nto privacy and to substantive due process. We now consider appellants’ arguments that the rules\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fimplicate a fundamental right under the First Amendment, namely, the rights to freedom of\n\nassociation and of expression.\n\n                Appellants claim that both park rules infringe upon their right to associate with their\n\nchildren. Appellants also assert that “the associational rights of parents and children are among those\n\nintimate relationships which are protected by the First Amendment.”\n\n                We recognize that appellants have a right to enter into and maintain certain intimate\n\nhuman relationships. See, e.g., Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 617-18 (1984)\n\n(discussing two distinct lines of cases recognizing a right to associate, one related to certain intimate\n\nhuman relationships and another “for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First\n\nAmendment—speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, and the exercise of religion”);\n\nZablocki, 434 U.S. at 383-86 (marriage); Smith v. Organization of Foster Families, 431 U.S. 816,\n\n844 (1977) (the raising and education of children); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 503-04\n\n(1977) (cohabitation with one’s relatives). However, we fail to see how either park rule infringes on\n\nthis right. The rules do not affect the ability of the Mortons or other naturist parents to associate with\n\ntheir children, but regulate only where such associations may occur. These rules are analogous to the\n\nordinance in City of Dallas v. Stanglin which barred minors from certain dance halls. City of Dallas\n\nv. Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 21 n.2 (1989).\n\n                Appellants further assert that the park rules violate their right to expressive association\n\nas recognized by the Supreme Court in Roberts v. United States Jaycees. Roberts, 468 U.S. at 617-\n\n18. In that case, the Court acknowledged a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those\n\n\n\n\n                                                    7\n\factivities protected by the First Amendment. Id. The issue, then, is whether the First Amendment\n\nencompasses appellants’ activities at McGregor Park.\n\n                  Appellants argue that their conduct at McGregor Park constitutes an expressive\n\nactivity and that the park rules violate their right to freedom of expression by impeding their ability\n\nto engage in this conduct as a family. Appellants characterize their nude recreational and social\n\nactivities at McGregor Park as instilling values in their children in a safe public setting. On the record\n\nbefore us, we find that appellants’ First Amendment right to expressive association does not\n\nencompass their activities at the park.\n\n                  The Supreme Court has acknowledged that nudity itself is not expressive conduct and\n\nis not constitutionally protected. Erznoznick v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 211 n.7 (1975)\n\n(“Scenes of nudity in a movie, like pictures of nude persons in a book, must be considered as a part\n\nof the whole work. In this respect, such nudity is distinguishable from the kind of public nudity\n\ntraditionally subject to indecent exposure statutes.” (internal citations omitted)); Barnes v. Glen\n\nTheatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 581 (1991) (Souter, J., concurring) (“[Nudity per se] is a condition, not\n\nan activity . . . .”).\n\n                  Appellants maintain that their naturist conduct at McGregor Park is entitled to First\n\nAmendment protection because it constitutes more than “mere nudity.” At oral argument, appellants\n\ndirected our attention to the Supreme Court’s recent opinion in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale. Boy\n\nScouts of Am. v. Dale, __ U.S. __ , 120 S. Ct. 2446, 2452 (2000). In Dale, the Supreme Court\n\nreviewed a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which held that the state’s public\n\naccommodations law required the Boy Scouts to admit Dale, an avowed homosexual, as an adult\n\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fmember. Id. at 2449. The Court held that “applying New Jersey’s public accommodations law in\n\nthis way violates the Boy Scouts’ First Amendment right of expressive association.” Id.\n\n               Appellants sought to analogize their activities at McGregor Park to those engaged in\n\nby the Boy Scouts. While appellants and the Boy Scouts may share a common goal to instill values\n\nin children, the manner in which these values are transmitted is distinguishable. The Boy Scouts, as\n\nan organization, seeks to transfer its values to its members by “having its adult leaders spend time\n\nwith the youth members, instructing and engaging them in activities like camping, archery, and\n\nfishing.” Id. at 2452. In contrast, appellants seek to convey their values to their children by engaging\n\nin swimming, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation in the nude at McGregor Park. Of critical\n\nimportance to appellants is not the activity itself, but rather, the manner in which the activity is\n\nconducted—in the nude and in public. We therefore find that this case is distinguishable from Boy\n\nScouts of America v. Dale.\n\n               The protected activity that appellants claim in this case is identical to the one asserted\n\nin South Florida Free Beaches v. City of Miami. South Fla. Free Beaches v. City of Miami, 734\n\nF.2d 608, 608 (11th Cir. 1984). In that case, the plaintiffs argued that nude sunbathing in a public\n\narea is the manner in which they advocate and communicate their philosophy that the human body\n\nis wholesome and that nudity is not indecent to others. Id. at 609. The Eleventh Circuit rejected that\n\nargument and held that nude sunbathing is not protected expression. Id. (“Stripped of constitutional\n\nprotection, nude sunbathing is subject to legitimate governmental proscriptions. Thus, we hold that\n\nthe [F]irst [A]mendment does not clothe these plaintiffs with a constitutional right to sunbathe in the\n\nnude.”); accord Williams v. Kleppe, 539 F.2d 803, 806 n.9 (1st Cir. 1976) (sanctioning a ban on nude\n\nsunbathing by stating, “[N]o rights of free speech can be said to have been involved here”). Likewise,\n\n\n                                                   9\n\fin Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, the Fifth Circuit recognized, “‘[N]udity is protected as speech\n\nonly when combined with some mode of expression which itself is entitled to [F]irst [A]mendment\n\nprotection.’” Hang On, Inc. v. City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248, 1254 (5th Cir. 1995) (quoting South\n\nFla. Free Beaches, 734 F.2d at 610).\n\n               Here, as in South Florida Free Beaches, appellants also seek to garner First\n\nAmendment protection for their efforts to communicate their values that the human body is\n\nwholesome and that nudity is not indecent to others.           Because the facts of this case are\n\nindistinguishable from South Florida Free Beaches, we reach the same conclusion. For the reasons\n\nstated in South Florida Free Beaches and Hang On, we decline to hold that nude sunbathing is\n\nprotected expression. Accordingly, we reject appellants’ First Amendment argument based on the\n\nright to freedom of expression. In doing so, we also reject appellants’ argument that the park rules\n\nimpinge on their right to expressive association. Consequently, we conclude that the park rules do\n\nnot implicate a fundamental right under the United States Constitution.\n\n               Having concluded that the strict scrutiny test does not apply here, we must now\n\nidentify whether an intermediate scrutiny or rational basis analysis is appropriate. On its face, the\n\ngovernment action in this case distinguishes between individuals based solely on age. Age distinctions\n\nare subject to the rational relationship test. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470-71 (1991)\n\n(referencing Vance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979); Massachusetts Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427\n\nU.S. 307, 314 (1976)).\n\n               An analysis under the rational relationship test is deferential to the government.\n\nGregory, 501 U.S. at 470-71 (“In cases where a classification burdens neither a suspect group nor\n\na fundamental interest, ‘courts are quite reluctant to overturn governmental action on the ground that\n\n\n                                                 10\n\fit denies equal protection of the laws.’” (citation omitted)); Kite, 661 F.2d at 1030 (“A state action\n\nviewed under the rational basis banner is presumed to be valid.”). The government must prove only\n\nthat the laws bear “some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.” Rodriguez, 411 U.S.\n\nat 44; accord Gregory, 501 U.S. at 471. In examining a city ordinance imposing an age restriction\n\non admission to certain dance halls, the Supreme Court stated,\n\n\n        [A] State does not violate the Equal Protection Clause merely because the\n        classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some\n        ‘reasonable basis,’ it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification\n        ‘is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some\n        inequality.’\n\n\nStanglin, 490 U.S. at 26-27 (quoting Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970)) (citations\n\nomitted). We must now determine whether the park rules are justified by a legitimate state purpose.\n\n                Appellants concede in their brief that they do not challenge Travis County’s “right to\n\nregulate the activities of minors and ban unaccompanied minors from [McGregor Park].”3 Consistent\n\nwith their argument that the rules are subject to strict scrutiny, appellants charge instead that “the\n\nrules are not narrowly crafted to the least restrictive manner.” Appellants claim that the curfew\n\nordinance in Qutb was upheld because the law established defenses for infractions of the ordinance,\n\nincluding one that exempted minors accompanied by a parent or guardian. Unlike this case, however,\n\n\n   3\n        Courts have recognized that laws may treat minors differently from adults. Bellotti v. Baird,\n443 U.S. 622, 634 (1979); Qutb v. Strauss, 11 F.3d 488, 492 (5th Cir. 1993); Barber v. Colorado\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 901 S.W.2d 447, 451 (Tex. 1995). Furthermore, the Supreme Court has\nacknowledged that states have a “strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens,\nwhose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes impair their ability to exercise\ntheir rights wisely.” Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417, 444 (1990). In addition, the Court has\nrecognized that a “[s]tate is entitled to adjust its legal system to account for children’s vulnerability\nand their needs for ‘concern, . . . sympathy, and . . . paternal attention.’” Bellotti, 443 U.S. at 635\n(quoting McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 550 (1970)).\n\n                                                   11\n\fthe court in Qutb applied a strict scrutiny analysis to the curfew ordinance after it “assume[d] without\n\ndeciding that the right to move about freely is a fundamental right.” Qutb, 11 F.3d at 492. We have\n\nalready concluded that the park rules at issue are not subject to a strict scrutiny analysis; therefore,\n\nthe government need not satisfy this requirement here.4 With no dispute that a legitimate state\n\ninterest exists for an age restriction, we conclude that the rules do not violate the Equal Protection\n\nClause. Accordingly, we overrule appellants’ first issue.\n\n\nExclusion of Summary Judgment Evidence\n\n                In their second issue on appeal, appellants maintain that the district court erred when\n\nit excluded two items of evidence submitted in support of their motion, namely, a videotape entitled\n\n“Natural Summer” and incident reports from Pease Park compiled by the Austin Police Department\n\n(“APD”). Appellants assert that this evidence rebutted Travis County’s contentions that McGregor\n\nPark incident reports demonstrated an increased risk of sexual offenses against children and that these\n\nrules were enacted to achieve legitimate state interests—to protect minors from exposure to sexual\n\noffenses and victimization. The county objected to the APD reports because they detailed incidents\n\noccurring at Pease Park, a city park, rather than a county park like McGregor Park. Because the\n\nvideotape related to parks other than McGregor Park and nudist practices not at issue here, Travis\n\nCounty also objected to it on the grounds of relevance. The district court agreed with Travis County\n\nand excluded the APD reports and the videotape as not relevant.\n\n                We apply an abuse of discretion standard to the question of whether a district court\n\nerred in excluding evidence. City of Brownsville v. Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1995).\n\n\n   4\n       The government need only show that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state\ninterest under a strict scrutiny analysis. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-17 (1982).\n\n                                                  12\n\fA district court may be reversed under this standard only when a reviewing court finds that “the court\n\nacted in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner.” Beaumont Bank, N.A. v. Buller, 806 S.W.2d 223, 226\n\n(Tex. 1991); Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985). “A\n\n[district] . . . court abuses its discretion when it rules ‘without regard for any guiding rules or\n\nprinciples.’” Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v. Malone, 972 S.W.2d 35, 43 (Tex. 1998) (quoting\n\nAlvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 754).\n\n                When seeking to reverse a judgment based on an improper evidentiary ruling, a\n\ncomplaining party “need not prove that but for the error a different judgment would necessarily have\n\nbeen rendered, but only that the error probably resulted in an improper judgment.” Alvarado, 897\n\nS.W.2d at 753; accord Malone, 972 S.W.2d at 43. To prevail, the party must demonstrate that “the\n\njudgment turns on the particular evidence excluded or admitted.” Alvarado, 897 S.W.2d at 753-54.\n\nWe review the entire record to determine whether a party has met this burden. Id. at 754. If any\n\nlegitimate basis exists to support a district court’s evidentiary ruling, then we must uphold the court’s\n\ndecision. Malone, 972 S.W.2d at 43; State Bar v. Evans, 774 S.W.2d 656, 658 n.5 (Tex. 1989)\n\n(citing McCormick on Evidence § 52, at 131 (3d ed. 1984)).\n\n                Rule 402 of the Texas Rules of Evidence states, “All relevant evidence is admissible,\n\nexcept as otherwise provided by Constitution, by statute, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed\n\npursuant to statutory authority.” Tex. R. Evid. 402. The rules define relevant evidence as “having\n\nany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the\n\naction more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Tex. R. Evid. 401.\n\nIn other words, evidence is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove any fact of consequence, thereby\n\nassisting the trier of fact. We have recognized that relevancy determinations should be left primarily\n\n\n                                                   13\n\fto the trial court, which relies on its own observations and experience. Corley v. State, 987 S.W.2d\n\n615, 618 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, no pet.) (citing Moreno v. State, 858 S.W.2d 453, 463 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1993)).\n\n               Appellants maintain that the videotape was offered “to demonstrate the wholesome-\n\nnon-obscene-nature of social-familial nudity that is referenced in the Mortons’ affidavits” and “the\n\nextent in which the naturist movement has made an enclave into the American culture.” Because\n\nthese purposes are not at issue in this case, the district court could have reasonably concluded that\n\nthe videotape did not involve facts of consequence and, as a result, was not relevant.\n\n               Appellants also contend that the Pease Park incident reports were offered to rebut the\n\nincident reports offered by Travis County “to establish that there were more reported sexual offenses\n\nat . . . [McGregor Park], than other County parks.” Given Pease Park’s status as a city park, the\n\ndistrict court could have reasonably concluded that these reports were not relevant because they have\n\nno bearing on how the rate of reported sexual offenses at McGregor Park compares to other Travis\n\nCounty parks. We conclude that a legitimate basis exists to support the district court’s evidentiary\n\nrulings on both exhibits of summary judgment evidence and overrule appellants’ second issue.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               Because we conclude that both Travis County park rules are constitutional and that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding summary judgment evidence, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f                                            Jan P.

CAMPBELL, JR., JUDGE PRESIDING\n\n\n\n\n               The question presented is whether county park rules that ban children’s access to a\n\nclothing-optional park violate the United States and Texas Constitutions. See U.S. Const. amend.\n\nI, XIV; Tex. Const. art. I, §§ 3, 8, 19, 27. Central Texas Nudists, Robert A. Morton, Jr., and\n\nChristine A. Morton, individually and as next friend of Robert A. Morton, III, Rebecca E. Morton,\n\nand Charles G. Morton, minor children (collectively, “appellants”) filed suit against Travis County\n\nand the Lower Colorado River Authority, seeking a declaratory judgment and permanent injunctive\n\nrelief. This appeal arises from a judgment denying appellants’ motion for summary judgment and\n\ngranting the motions for summary judgment of Travis County and the Lower Colorado River\n\nAuthority. We affirm the district court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n                                             FACTS\n\f                 McGregor Park1 is a public park owned by the Lower Colorado River Authority and\n\nsituated on Lake Travis in Travis County. The county has managed McGregor Park since the 1980s\n\nwhen it leased the park from the Lower Colorado River Authority. In 1995, Travis County\n\npromulgated two park rules for McGregor Park, which were adopted by the Commissioners Court\n\nof Travis County. Recognizing that nude sunbathing occurs in the park, the Commissioners (1)\n\nrestricted access to the park to persons over the age of eighteen and (2) directed:\n\n\n          Any authorization or consent to the nude display of children and the nude display of\n          adults with children present under the age of eighteen in this park will be treated as\n          a violation of the law and park rules. Violators and parties to such violations will be\n          investigated and prosecuted if possible.\n\n\nBecause appellants are “naturists” who believe that engaging in nude social activities with their\n\nchildren instills values of body acceptance and other naturist values, they contend that these new rules\n\ninfringe on their constitutional rights of, inter alia, freedom of expression and privacy, by prohibiting\n\ntheir children from accompanying them to the park.\n\n                 After considering each party’s motion for summary judgment, the district court\n\ngranted the motions filed by Travis County and the Lower Colorado River Authority and denied\n\nappellants’ motion.\n\n                                      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n                 Because the propriety of a ruling on a motion for summary judgment and the\n\nconstitutionality of a rule raise questions of law, we review these matters de novo.

U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellants argue that by prohibiting\n\nminor children from entering the park, even when accompanied by their parents, the rules distinguish\n\nbetween classes of individuals on the basis of whether minor children accompany them to McGregor\n\nPark.\n\n               The Equal Protection Clause requires that all similarly situated persons be treated\n\nalike.

Neither rule prohibits appellants from raising their children according to the\n\nnaturist philosophy. Rather, the rules impose a restriction on where the practice of this philosophy\n\nmay occur by establishing an age restriction for admittance to McGregor Park that applies to all\n\nfamilies, whether naturist or not. Consequently, we reject appellants’ arguments based on the rights\n\nto privacy and to substantive due process.

Id. The issue, then, is whether the First Amendment\n\nencompasses appellants’ activities at McGregor Park.\n\n                  Appellants argue that their conduct at McGregor Park constitutes an expressive\n\nactivity and that the park rules violate their right to freedom of expression by impeding their ability\n\nto engage in this conduct as a family. Appellants characterize their nude recreational and social\n\nactivities at McGregor Park as instilling values in their children in a safe public setting. On the record\n\nbefore us, we find that appellants’ First Amendment right to expressive association does not\n\nencompass their activities at the park.\n\n                  The Supreme Court has acknowledged that nudity itself is not expressive conduct and\n\nis not constitutionally protected.

In Dale, the Supreme Court\n\nreviewed a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, which held that the state’s public\n\naccommodations law required the Boy Scouts to admit Dale, an avowed homosexual, as an adult\n\n\n\n\n                                                    8\n\fmember. Id. at 2449. The Court held that “applying New Jersey’s public accommodations law in\n\nthis way violates the Boy Scouts’ First Amendment right of expressive association.” Id.\n\n               Appellants sought to analogize their activities at McGregor Park to those engaged in\n\nby the Boy Scouts. While appellants and the Boy Scouts may share a common goal to instill values\n\nin children, the manner in which these values are transmitted is distinguishable. The Boy Scouts, as\n\nan organization, seeks to transfer its values to its members by “having its adult leaders spend time\n\nwith the youth members, instructing and engaging them in activities like camping, archery, and\n\nfishing.” Id. at 2452. In contrast, appellants seek to convey their values to their children by engaging\n\nin swimming, sunbathing, and other forms of recreation in the nude at McGregor Park. Of critical\n\nimportance to appellants is not the activity itself, but rather, the manner in which the activity is\n\nconducted—in the nude and in public. We therefore find that this case is distinguishable from Boy\n\nScouts of America v. Dale.\n\n               The protected activity that appellants claim in this case is identical to the one asserted\n\nin South Florida Free Beaches v. City of Miami. South Fla. Free Beaches v.

Because the facts of this case are\n\nindistinguishable from South Florida Free Beaches, we reach the same conclusion. For the reasons\n\nstated in South Florida Free Beaches and Hang On, we decline to hold that nude sunbathing is\n\nprotected expression. Accordingly, we reject appellants’ First Amendment argument based on the\n\nright to freedom of expression. In doing so, we also reject appellants’ argument that the park rules\n\nimpinge on their right to expressive association. Consequently, we conclude that the park rules do\n\nnot implicate a fundamental right under the United States Constitution.\n\n               Having concluded that the strict scrutiny test does not apply here, we must now\n\nidentify whether an intermediate scrutiny or rational basis analysis is appropriate.

Appellants assert that this evidence rebutted Travis County’s contentions that McGregor\n\nPark incident reports demonstrated an increased risk of sexual offenses against children and that these\n\nrules were enacted to achieve legitimate state interests—to protect minors from exposure to sexual\n\noffenses and victimization. The county objected to the APD reports because they detailed incidents\n\noccurring at Pease Park, a city park, rather than a county park like McGregor Park. Because the\n\nvideotape related to parks other than McGregor Park and nudist practices not at issue here, Travis\n\nCounty also objected to it on the grounds of relevance.

R. Evid. 401.\n\nIn other words, evidence is relevant if it tends to prove or disprove any fact of consequence, thereby\n\nassisting the trier of fact. We have recognized that relevancy determinations should be left primarily\n\n\n                                                   13\n\fto the trial court, which relies on its own observations and experience.

[McGregor Park], than other County parks.” Given Pease Park’s status as a city park, the\n\ndistrict court could have reasonably concluded that these reports were not relevant because they have\n\nno bearing on how the rate of reported sexual offenses at McGregor Park compares to other Travis\n\nCounty parks. We conclude that a legitimate basis exists to support the district court’s evidentiary\n\nrulings on both exhibits of summary judgment evidence and overrule appellants’ second issue.\n\n\n                                         CONCLUSION\n\n               Because we conclude that both Travis County park rules are constitutional and that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding summary judgment evidence, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 14\n\f                                            Jan P.
