Subsequently, the\n\n22   Parents filed a due-process complaint against the DOE\n\n23   seeking tuition reimbursement.     After twelve hearing days,\n\n24   an impartial hearing officer granted them that relief.          The\n\n25   DOE appealed to a state review officer, who reversed that\n\n26   decision.    The Parents then filed a civil action in United\n\n27   States District Court for the Eastern District of New York\n\n28   (Weinstein, J.), which affirmed the order denying tuition\n\n\n\n                                Page 2 of   37\n\f 1   reimbursement.   The Parents appeal principally contending\n\n 2   that the individualized education program’s integrated co-\n\n 3   teaching services violated the IDEA’s least restrictive\n\n 4   environment mandate by placing their child in a classroom\n\n 5   with as many as twelve other students who also had\n\n 6   individualized education programs.       We AFFIRM.\n\n 7                               Background\n\n 8   I.   The Legal Framework\n\n 9        The IDEA requires New York state to “provide disabled\n\n10   children with a free and appropriate public education\n\n11   (‘FAPE’).”   R.E. v. N.Y. City Dep’t of Educ., 694 F.3d 167,\n\n12   174-75 (2d Cir. 2012) (citation omitted).      Accordingly, the\n\n13   DOE, through a Committee on Special Education (“CSE”), must\n\n14   produce, in writing, an individualized education program\n\n15   (“IEP”), see 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d), that “describes the\n\n16   specially designed instruction and services that will enable\n\n17   the child to meet” stated educational objectives and is\n\n18   reasonably calculated to give educational benefits to the\n\n19   child.   R.E., 694 F.3d at 175 (internal quotation marks and\n\n20   citation omitted).   Should a parent believe that the school\n\n21   district breached these IDEA duties by failing to provide\n\n22   their disabled child a FAPE, the parent may unilaterally\n\n                                Page 3 of   37\n\f 1   place their child in a private school at their own financial\n\n 2   risk and seek tuition reimbursement.       See Florence Cnty.\n\n 3   Sch. Dist. Four v. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 9-10, 16 (1993).\n\n 4        To begin the tuition-reimbursement process, a parent\n\n 5   must first file a due-process complaint which triggers an\n\n 6   administrative-review process that begins with a hearing in\n\n 7   front of an impartial hearing officer (“IHO”).       See 20\n\n 8   U.S.C. § 1415(b)(6), (f); N.Y. Educ. L. § 4404(1).      The\n\n 9   three-pronged Burlington/Carter test, as construed by New\n\n10   York Education Law § 4404(1)(c), governs that hearing: (1)\n\n11   the DOE must establish that the student’s IEP actually\n\n12   provided a FAPE; should the DOE fail to meet that burden,\n\n13   the parents are entitled to reimbursement1 if (2) they\n\n          1\n           The Parents invite us to expressly hold that the DOE\n     carries their New York Education Law § 4404(1)(c) burden all the\n     way into federal court, which would require us to decide whether\n     the IDEA preempts that law. We do not need to address that\n     argument “[b]ecause the State Review Officer[] in the case[] at\n     bar concluded that the IEP[ was] proper, and the courts are bound\n     to exhibit deference to that decision[;] the burden of\n     demonstrating that the respective Review Officers erred is\n     properly understood to fall on plaintiffs . . . , which party\n     bore the burden of persuasion in the state review scheme is only\n     relevant if the evidence was in equipose.” M.H. v. NYC Dep’t of\n     Educ., 685 F.3d 217, 225 n.3 (2d Cir. 2012). Here, the evidence\n     is not in equipose. Moreover, it “is incumbent upon the Parents\n     to bring to the Court’s attention any procedural or substantive\n     flaws and explain why they allegedly warrant reversal.” W.T. &\n     K.T. ex rel. J.T. v. Bd. of Educ. of Sch. Dist. of N.Y., 716 F.\n     Supp. 2d 270, 287 (S.D.N.Y. 2010).\n\n\n                               Page 4 of   37\n\f 1   establish that their unilateral placement was appropriate\n\n 2   and (3) the equities favor them.      See R.E., 694 F.3d at 184-\n\n 3   85 (citing Carter, 510 U.S. at 7; Sch. Comm. of Town of\n\n 4   Burlington v. Dep’t of Educ., 471 U.S. 359 (1985)).      A state\n\n 5   review officer (“SRO”) evaluates appeals from an IHO’s\n\n 6   decision, see N.Y. Educ. Law § 4404(2), and either party may\n\n 7   seek review of an SRO decision by bringing a civil action in\n\n 8   federal court, see 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(2)(A).\n\n 9   II. Statement of Facts\n\n10       A.      M.W.\n\n11       M.W. is an autistic boy with Pervasive Developmental\n\n12   Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, certain\n\n13   speech and language disorders, and fine and gross motor\n\n14   deficits.    Despite these setbacks, M.W. has an average IQ;\n\n15   he is bright and can learn.    His autism and developmental\n\n16   disorders, however, present behavioral and social-emotional\n\n17   problems that have resulted in academic under-performance\n\n18   and have required speech, occupational, and physical\n\n19   therapies.    M.W. also requires direct, hands-on supervision\n\n20   during the school day from a paraprofessional, who helps him\n\n21   stay focused when his attention strays and calm in the event\n\n22   of a behavioral crisis.\n\n                               Page 5 of   37\n\f 1        After the Parents rejected the IEP for the 2009-2010\n\n 2   school year, M.W. attended Luria, a Montessori school, where\n\n 3   he had the support of his full-time paraprofessional in a\n\n 4   classroom designed for typically developing students.      On\n\n 5   January 30, 2010, Mom sent an email to Luria indicating a\n\n 6   desire to re-enroll M.W. for the 2010-2011 school year\n\n 7   before the CSE developed the contested IEP subject to this\n\n 8   appeal.   Shortly thereafter, Mom submitted an application to\n\n 9   Luria which included a tuition contract and down payment to\n\n10   hold M.W.’s spot.\n\n11        Luria teachers do not use formal assessments to track\n\n12   progress and rely on “a lot [of] note-taking and\n\n13   observation” to track the child’s progress.     See Tr. 937.\n\n14   Though M.W. progressed socially during the 2009-2010 school\n\n15   year, he continued to have “a lot of behavioral issues that\n\n16   [we]re getting in the way of his progress” through the 2010-\n\n17   2011 school year.   Id. at 921.    When these behavioral issues\n\n18   disrupted the class, his paraprofessional removed him from\n\n19   the classroom to work with him outside, sometimes on the\n\n20   floor.2   Id. at 945-50.\n\n\n          2\n             The record does not clearly set out the amount of time\n     M.W. spent outside the classroom during both the 2009-2010 school\n     year and the 2010-2011 school year. For the 2009-2010 school\n\n                                Page 6 of   37\n\f 1        B.     M.W.’s Individualized Education Program\n\n 2         On June 10, 2010, the CSE convened to develop M.W.’s\n\n 3   2010-2011 IEP.    The following individuals constituted the\n\n 4   CSE: (1) Mom; (2) Sara Malasky, M.W.’s general education\n\n 5   teacher, who participated via telephone; (3) Chanie Graus, a\n\n 6   school psychologist who acted as a school-district\n\n 7   representative; (4) a special education teacher; and (5) a\n\n 8   parent representative.    M.W. was seven years old, and the\n\n 9   IEP was for his second-grade year, 2010-2011.\n\n10        The IEP described M.W. as a seven-year-old autistic\n\n11   child of average intelligence with Pervasive Developmental\n\n12   Disorder.    Despite his disorders, the IEP recognized that\n\n13   M.W. had “made progress . . . in the area of peer\n\n14   interactions” and, during the previous year at Luria, M.W.\n\n15   had made friends and was “able to participate in a\n\n\n     year, M.W.’s Floor Time therapist worked with him outside the\n     classroom. When sent to observe M.W. before the CSE meeting that\n     produced the challenged IEP, the DOE representative observed M.W.\n     on the hallway floor having an emotional breakdown during his\n     Floor Time therapy. Around September of the 2010-2011 school\n     year, M.W. developed Tourette Syndrome which caused a frequently\n     disruptive tic. For that year, M.W. spent a significant amount\n     of time outside of the classroom to work one-on-one with his\n     paraprofessional as needed to control his disruptions. See Tr.\n     816, 824-25, 845-46, 854, 939, 945-50. Additionally, M.W.’s\n     teacher and paraprofessional would plan ahead to have him removed\n     from the classroom for instruction, sometimes with another\n     student. Tr. 808, 923.\n\n                               Page 7 of   37\n\f 1   continuous flow of back and forth interactions” with his\n\n 2   peers.   Sealed App’x 1847.   The IEP, however, also noted\n\n 3   that M.W. had significant self-regulation difficulties,\n\n 4   became frustrated easily, and struggled to calm himself down\n\n 5   in the event of a behavioral crisis.       Id.\n\n 6        The IEP recommended placement in a general education\n\n 7   environment with integrated co-teaching (“ICT”) services\n\n 8   with a 12:1 staffing ratio, five days a week, for a ten-\n\n 9   month school year.3    The IEP also provided M.W. with a full-\n\n10   time behavioral management paraprofessional to give him one-\n\n11   on-one help self-regulating in times of behavioral crisis,\n\n12   and these other related services:\n\n13       Service                Sessions x Week       Duration   Students\n14   1   Counseling             1 x week              30 mins.   3\n15   2   Occupational           3 x week              30 mins.   1\n         Therapy\n16   3   Physical Therapy       2 x week              30 mins.   1\n17   4   Speech/Language        2 x week              30 mins.   1\n         Therapy\n\n\n\n\n          3\n             The 12:1 staffing ratio means that one special education\n     teacher would provide ICT services for up to twelve IEP students,\n     the statutory maximum, in a classroom that also included\n     typically developing students, a general education curriculum,\n     and a general education teacher. For a detailed discussion of\n     ICT services, see Discussion, infra, at XX.\n\n                               Page 8 of   37\n\f 1   5   Speech/Language         1 x week          30 mins.   2\n         Therapy\n\n 2   Sealed App’x 1860.\n\n 3       Finally, the IEP concluded that M.W.’s “behavior\n\n 4   seriously interfere[d] with instruction and require[d]\n\n 5   additional adult support.”     Id. 1847.    Based on those\n\n 6   conclusions, the IEP required a behavioral intervention plan\n\n 7   (“BIP”), which was incorporated in the IEP.       Id. at 1860.\n\n 8   The BIP identified “emotional meltdowns,” “poor self-\n\n 9   regulation,” and “poor attention” as the behavioral\n\n10   difficulties that impaired M.W.’s academic progress and\n\n11   recommended a reward system, praise and encouragement, and\n\n12   positive modeling as strategies to modify those behaviors.\n\n13   Id. at 1862.    The goal was to teach M.W. to become more\n\n14   attentive and focused and to better control himself when\n\n15   frustrated.    Id.   To implement those strategies, M.W.’s\n\n16   teacher, paraprofessional, and the Parents were to\n\n17   collaborate.   The BIP did not quantify data relating to the\n\n18   frequency of M.W.’s “meltdowns” because Luria did not\n\n19   provide a functional behavior assessment (“FBA”), and the\n\n20   DOE did not request or develop one.\n\n21       On July 1, 2010, the DOE sent a letter to M.W.’s\n\n22   Parents that classified M.W. as an autistic student and\n\n                                Page 9 of   37\n\f 1   recommended an ICT classroom4 at P.S. 197, the Ocean School,\n\n 2   with the related services that the IEP recommended.      Mom\n\n 3   visited the school, decided to keep M.W. at Luria, and\n\n 4   immediately began the administrative-review process seeking\n\n 5   reimbursement for the 2010-2011 school year.\n\n 6        C.   Administrative Review\n\n 7        On July 8, 2010, the Parents filed their demand for due\n\n 8   process and requested a hearing.      The Parents subsequently\n\n 9   amended their demands on September 29, 2010.      On May 2,\n\n10   2011, the Parents submitted their closing brief after 12\n\n11   hearing days that took place over the entire school year.\n\n12   In relevant parts, the Parents argued that the IEP would\n\n13   have denied M.W. a FAPE because the IEP Team created a BIP\n\n14   without the benefit of an FBA and the IEP failed to provide\n\n15   parent counseling and training as a related service.      The\n\n16   Parents also argued that the P.S. 197 placement was\n\n17   defective because the recommended 10-month program exposed\n\n18\n\n\n          4\n             The letter actually recommended Collaborative Team\n     Teaching (“CTT”). CTT is equivalent to ICT. See\n     http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/policy/schoolagec\n     ontinuum.html (“New York City (NYC) has used the term\n     ‘collaborative team teaching’ (CTT) to identify a service that\n     meets the regulatory definition of integrated co-teaching\n     services.”). In any event, the parties do not mention or argue\n     over this distinction.\n\n                              Page 10 of   37\n\f 1   M.W. to regression risks.    Finally, the Parents argued that\n\n 2   the IEP assigned M.W. to an overly restrictive environment.\n\n 3       The IHO expressly agreed with the Parents regarding the\n\n 4   BIP, the omission of parental counseling, and the inadequacy\n\n 5   of a 10-month program.    Though the IHO mentioned the least\n\n 6   restrictive environment requirement in passing, she made no\n\n 7   explicit findings as to whether a general education\n\n 8   environment with ICT services would be too restrictive.5\n\n 9   See Sealed App’x 2155.    The IHO found Luria to be an\n\n10   appropriate placement and that the equities favored the\n\n11   Parents.    Accordingly, the IHO ordered that the Parents be\n\n12   reimbursed, and the DOE sought review by a SRO.    The SRO\n\n13   reversed the IHO’s determinations and denied tuition\n\n14   reimbursement.    Relying heavily on the SRO’s analysis, the\n\n15   district court affirmed that decision, and the Parents\n\n16   appealed.\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\n         5\n             The IHO found that the ICT classroom, generally, was\n     inappropriate because the class size was too large and the\n     decision to make that placement was unsupported by documentary\n     evidence. IHO Decision at 27. The IHO also summarily concluded\n     that ICT service was an inappropriate support system for M.W.’s\n     developmental problems. Id. Those criticisms, however, were not\n     tied to a restrictiveness analysis and offer no insight into\n     Parents’ least restrictive environment arguments on appeal.\n\n                              Page 11 of   37\n\f 1                               Discussion\n\n 2   I.   Standard of Review and Burdens of Proof\n\n 3        We undergo a circumscribed de novo review of a district\n\n 4   court’s grant of summary judgment in the IDEA context\n\n 5   because the “responsibility for determining whether a\n\n 6   challenged IEP will provide a child with [a FAPE] rests in\n\n 7   the first instance with administrative hearing and review\n\n 8   officers.”   M.H. v. New York City Dep’t of Educ., 685 F.3d\n\n 9   217, 240 (2d Cir. 2012).     Summary judgment in the IDEA\n\n10   context, therefore, is only a “pragmatic procedural\n\n11   mechanism for reviewing administrative decisions.”     T.P. ex\n\n12   rel S.P. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. Dist., 554 F.3d 247,\n\n13   252 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks\n\n14   and citation omitted).     This review “‘requires a more\n\n15   critical appraisal of the agency determination than clear-\n\n16   error review’” but “‘falls well short of complete de novo\n\n17   review.’” M.H., 685 F.3d at 244 (quoting Lenn v. Portland\n\n18   Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1086-87 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal\n\n19   citations omitted)).     Accordingly, our de novo review only\n\n20   seeks to independently verify that the administrative record\n\n21   supports the district court’s determination that a student’s\n\n22   IEP was adequate.   See R.E., 694 F.3d at 184.\n\n\n                               Page 12 of   37\n\f 1       In undertaking this independent review, we are further\n\n 2   restrained by our lack of specialized knowledge and\n\n 3   educational expertise; “we must defer to the administrative\n\n 4   decision [particularly where] the state officer’s review\n\n 5   ‘has been thorough and careful.’”      See id. (quoting Walczak\n\n 6   v. Florida Union Free Sch. Dist., 142 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir.\n\n 7   1998)).   While we will not “rubber stamp” administrative\n\n 8   decisions, we remain equally mindful that we cannot\n\n 9   substitute our own “notions of sound educational policy for\n\n10   those of the school authorities” under review.      M.H., 685\n\n11   F.3d at 240.    Furthermore, when, as here, “an IHO and SRO\n\n12   reach conflicting conclusions, ‘[w]e defer to the final\n\n13   decision of the state authorities,’ that is, the SRO’s\n\n14   decision.”     R.E., 694 F.3d at 189 (quoting A.C. ex rel. M.C.\n\n15   v. Bd. of Educ. of Chappaqua Cent. Sch. Dist., 553 F.3d 165,\n\n16   171 (2d Cir. 2009)).\n\n17       Recently, we parsed the amount of deference an SRO’s\n\n18   determination deserves and concluded that it “depends on the\n\n19   quality of that opinion.”     See R.E., 694 F.3d at 189.\n\n20   “Reviewing courts must look to the factors that ‘normally\n\n21   determine whether any particular judgment is persuasive, for\n\n22   example, whether the decision being reviewed is well-\n\n23   reasoned, and whether it was based on substantially greater\n\n                               Page 13 of   37\n\f 1   familiarity with the evidence and the witnesses than the\n\n 2   reviewing court.’”   Id. at 189 (quoting M.H., 685 F.3d at\n\n 3   244).   Where an SRO has clearly demonstrated a better\n\n 4   command of the record and supported her conclusions through\n\n 5   better legal and factual analysis than an IHO, we will have\n\n 6   little difficulty deferring to the SRO’s opinion.      See id.\n\n 7   Accordingly, an appellant seeking to have a reviewing court\n\n 8   credit an IHO’s determination over an SRO’s determination\n\n 9   would benefit from calling our attention to an SRO’s\n\n10   specific errors in law, fact, or reasoning.6\n\n11   II. Procedural Violations\n\n12       “In determining whether an IEP complies with the IDEA,\n\n13   courts make a two-part inquiry that is, first, procedural,\n\n14   and second, substantive.”     Id. at 189-90.   Procedural\n\n15   violations warrant tuition reimbursement only if they\n\n16   “‘impeded the child’s right to a [FAPE],’ ‘significantly\n\n17   impeded the parents’ opportunity to participate in the\n\n18   decision[-]making process,’ or ‘caused a deprivation of\n\n19   educational benefits.’”     Id. at 190 (quoting 20 U.S.C. §\n\n20   1415(f)(3)(E)(ii); A.C., 553 F.3d at 172).     That is, parents\n\n\n         6\n           By attempting to undercut the deference owed to the SRO\n     based on her alleged personal inexperience, Parents’ counsel\n     moved us to (re)articulate these guiding principles. See Compl.\n     at 8, ¶ 23.\n\n                               Page 14 of   37\n\f 1   must articulate how a procedural violation resulted in the\n\n 2   IEP’s substantive inadequacy or affected the decision-making\n\n 3   process.    Of course, “[m]ultiple procedural violations may\n\n 4   cumulatively result in the denial of a FAPE even if the\n\n 5   violations considered individually do not.”         Id.\n\n 6       Here, the Parents allege that the DOE committed two\n\n 7   procedural violations: it failed to undertake an FBA in\n\n 8   developing the BIP and it failed to include parental\n\n 9   training and counseling in the IEP.         The Parents also assert\n\n10   that the SRO impermissibly relied on retrospective testimony\n\n11   to justify those omissions.\n\n12       A.      Behavioral Intervention Plan\n\n13       An FBA provides an “identification of [a disabled\n\n14   student’s] problem behavior, the definition of the behavior\n\n15   in concrete terms, the identification of the contextual\n\n16   factors that contribute to the behavior . . . and the\n\n17   formulation of a hypothesis regarding the general conditions\n\n18   under which a behavior usually occurs and probable\n\n19   consequences that serve to maintain it.”         N.Y. Comp. Codes\n\n20   R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.1(r)).     “New York regulations\n\n21   require the department to conduct an FBA for a student\n\n22   ‘whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of\n\n23   others.’”    See R.E., 694 F.3d at 190 (quoting N.Y. Comp.\n\n                               Page 15 of   37\n\f 1   Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.4(b)(1)(v)). Those\n\n 2   regulations, however, only require an FBA “as necessary to\n\n 3   ascertain the physical, mental, behavioral and emotional\n\n 4   factors which contribute to [a] suspected disabilit[y].”\n\n 5   N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.4(b)(1)(v)\n\n 6   (emphasis added).\n\n 7          Though the “IDEA incorporates some but not all state\n\n 8   law concerning special education,” these regulations do not\n\n 9   raise the IDEA bar by rendering IEP’s developed without an\n\n10   FBA legally inadequate.    See A.C., 553 F.3d at 172 n.1\n\n11   (quoting Bay Shore Union Free Sch. Dist. v. Kain ex rel.\n\n12   Kain, 485 F.3d 730, 734 (2d Cir. 2007)).     The IDEA only\n\n13   requires a school district to “consider the use of positive\n\n14   behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies”\n\n15   when a child’s behavior impedes learning.      See id. at 172\n\n16   (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i)) (internal quotation\n\n17   marks omitted).    An FBA omission does, however, cause us to\n\n18   “take particular care to ensure that the IEP adequately\n\n19   addresses the child’s problem behaviors.”      R.E., 694 F.3d at\n\n20   190.    Two cases chart our course.    See R.E., 694 F.3d at\n\n21   192-95; A.C., 553 F.3d at 172-73.\n\n22          In A.C., we concluded that the failure to conduct an\n\n23   FBA did not make an IEP legally inadequate because it noted\n\n\n                               Page 16 of   37\n\f 1   (1) the student’s attention problems; (2) the student’s need\n\n 2   for a personal aide to help the student focus during class;\n\n 3   and (3) the student’s need for psychiatric and psychological\n\n 4   services.    A.C., 553 F.3d at 172.    In R.E. we considered the\n\n 5   effect of an FBA omission for three separate students.       See\n\n 6   R.E., 694 F.3d at 192-95.    For one student, we concluded\n\n 7   that an FBA omission did not deny a FAPE where (1) the CSE\n\n 8   reviewed documents regarding the student’s behavior, and (2)\n\n 9   the IEP provided strategies to address those behaviors,\n\n10   “including the use of a 1:1 aide to help him focus.”      Id. at\n\n11   193.    Moreover, we have decided that whether an IEP\n\n12   adequately addresses a disabled student’s behaviors and\n\n13   whether strategies for dealing with those behaviors are\n\n14   appropriate are “precisely the type of issue[s] upon which\n\n15   the IDEA requires deference to the expertise of the\n\n16   administrative officers.”    A.C., 553 F.3d at 172 (quoting\n\n17   Grim v. Rhinebeck Cent. Sch. Dist., 346 F.3d 377, 382 (2d\n\n18   Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n19          Failure to conduct an FBA, therefore, does not render\n\n20   an IEP legally inadequate under the IDEA so long as the IEP\n\n21   adequately identifies a student’s behavioral impediments and\n\n22   implements strategies to address that behavior.      See, e.g.,\n\n23   id.    Where the IEP actually includes a BIP, parents should\n\n\n                               Page 17 of   37\n\f 1   at least suggest how the lack of an FBA resulted in the\n\n 2   BIP’s inadequacy or prevented meaningful decision-making.\n\n 3   See R.E. at 189-90.     For example, parents could argue that\n\n 4   an FBA would have exposed a BIP’s obsolete assessment of the\n\n 5   student’s behavioral problems or that the recommended\n\n 6   behavior-modification strategies failed to accommodate the\n\n 7   frequency or intensity of the student’s behavioral problems.\n\n 8    Here, however, the Parents summarily argue that failure to\n\n 9   conduct an FBA made the IEP legally defective; the record\n\n10   belies those assertions.\n\n11       As an initial matter, the IHO’s FBA and BIP analysis\n\n12   consisted of a single sentence without citation to the\n\n13   administrative record: “Lastly, I find there was no FBA\n\n14   developed and the BIP was developed without parent or\n\n15   teacher involvement and I find the BIP was not appropriate.”\n\n16   IHO Decision at 28.     By contrast, the SRO provided an in-\n\n17   depth, four-page discussion of the issue replete with legal\n\n18   and factual analysis.     See SRO Decision at 17-20.   The SRO\n\n19   found that the IHO’s finding was unsubstantiated by a record\n\n20   which clearly established M.W.’s behavioral problems,\n\n21   identified strategies to manage those problems, and\n\n22   recommended a collaborative intervention plan between the\n\n23   Parents, teacher, and paraprofessional.\n\n\n                               Page 18 of   37\n\f 1       The SRO concluded that the BIP accurately described the\n\n 2   behaviors that interfered with learning: “emotional\n\n 3   meltdowns,” poor self-regulation, and poor attention.     In\n\n 4   support of her analysis, the SRO relied upon, inter alia,\n\n 5   the Luria progress reports, the Floor Time therapist’s\n\n 6   report, and Graus’s in-class observations of M.W., all of\n\n 7   which describe those behavioral difficulties in detail.        See\n\n 8   SRO Decision at 19 (citing Dist. Ex. 5-12).    The Parents\n\n 9   confirm the accuracy of those descriptions and do not\n\n10   contend that the IEP misidentified or overlooked their son’s\n\n11   behavioral issues.   See Parents’ Local Rule 56.1 Statement\n\n12   of Material Facts ¶ 5.    Accordingly, we agree with the SRO’s\n\n13   determination that the BIP adequately described M.W.’s\n\n14   behavioral impediments.\n\n15       The SRO also concluded that the BIP was consistent with\n\n16   the information available to the CSE and that the\n\n17   intervention services were adequate because they provided a\n\n18   broad, collaborative approach to implement specific\n\n19   strategies to modify those behaviors on a daily, one-on-one\n\n20   basis.   The Parents do not contend that M.W. needed more or\n\n21   less attention.   Additionally, the BIP recommended that M.W.\n\n22   be provided with a reward system, praise, encouragement, and\n\n23   positive modeling to learn to adjust his behavior within a\n\n\n                               Page 19 of   37\n\f 1   collaborative support system between parent, teacher, and\n\n 2   paraprofessional.    The Parents do not attack those\n\n 3   strategies.    The Parents have simply failed to articulate a\n\n 4   single reason why an FBA was required for a legally valid\n\n 5   BIP.\n\n 6          We therefore affirm the SRO’s determination that the\n\n 7   “hearing record does not support the impartial hearing\n\n 8   officer’s determination that the lack of an FBA rose to the\n\n 9   level of denying the student a FAPE where the IEP addressed\n\n10   behavioral needs.” SRO Decision at 20.      As in R.E., (1) the\n\n11   CSE reviewed documents regarding the student’s behavior, and\n\n12   (2) the IEP provided strategies to address those behaviors,\n\n13   including the use of a paraprofessional.      R.E., 694 F.3d at\n\n14   193.\n\n15          B.   Parental Counseling\n\n16          Next, the Parents argue that the IEP’s failure to\n\n17   include parental counseling denied M.W. a FAPE.      To enable\n\n18   parents to “perform appropriate follow-up intervention\n\n19   activities at home,” New York requires that an IEP provide\n\n20   parents of autistic students training and counseling.      See\n\n21   N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.13(d).     “Parent\n\n22   counseling and training means assisting parents in\n\n23   understanding the special needs of their child; providing\n\n\n                               Page 20 of   37\n\f 1   parents with information about child development; and\n\n 2   helping parents to acquire the necessary skills that will\n\n 3   allow them to support the implementation of their child’s\n\n 4   individualized education program.”     Id. § 200.1(kk)\n\n 5   (emphasis omitted).   The regulations contemplate parental\n\n 6   counseling for the educational benefit of the disabled\n\n 7   student by ensuring that the parents are equipped with the\n\n 8   skills and knowledge necessary to continue and implement the\n\n 9   student’s IEP at home.\n\n10       We have previously described counseling omissions as\n\n11   procedural violations “less serious than the omission of an\n\n12   FBA” because “the presence or absence of a parent-counseling\n\n13   provision does not necessarily have a direct effect on the\n\n14   substantive adequacy of the plan.”     R.E., 694 F.3d at 191.\n\n15   “Moreover, because school districts are required . . . to\n\n16   provide parent counseling, they remain accountable for their\n\n17   failure to do so no matter the contents of the IEP.”     Id.\n\n18   (citing N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.13(d)).\n\n19   If a parent wants counseling for her own sake, New York\n\n20   provides her a remedy.   Accordingly, failure to provide\n\n21   counseling ordinarily does not result in a FAPE denial or\n\n22   warrant tuition reimbursement.   See id.\n\n23\n\n\n                              Page 21 of   37\n\f 1         Here, the IHO again summarily decided that parent\n\n 2   counseling and training was required and that parent\n\n 3   workshops that would have been provided to the Parents by\n\n 4   the Ocean School would not give the Parents the tools\n\n 5   necessary to perform follow-up at home.     IHO Decision at 27-\n\n 6   28.   The IHO, however, did not explain those conclusions.\n\n 7   The SRO concluded that the counseling omission did not deny\n\n 8   M.W. a FAPE because Mom was a certified special education\n\n 9   teacher who had received, through her own initiative,\n\n10   training and counseling in the therapies that M.W. had\n\n11   previously used, and because the public school assigned to\n\n12   M.W. provided training and counseling.     The SRO also noted\n\n13   that the BIP required collaboration between\n\n14   paraprofessional, the Parents, and teacher in order to\n\n15   implement and support the recommended behavior-modification\n\n16   strategies.\n\n17         We defer to that analysis.   The Parents have not\n\n18   persuaded us that the parental counseling omission would\n\n19   deprive M.W. of FAPE.   The SRO’s analysis noted that Mom’s\n\n20   experience and the supports in the BIP provide adequate\n\n21   assurance that M.W.’s developmental plan and education would\n\n22   continue at home.\n\n23\n\n\n\n                              Page 22 of   37\n\f 1\n\n 2       C.    Retrospective Justifications\n\n 3       The Parents assert that the SRO routinely relied upon\n\n 4   impermissible retrospective justifications to fill in the\n\n 5   IEP’s inadequacies.      In R.E., we held “that retrospective\n\n 6   testimony that the school district would have provided\n\n 7   additional services beyond those listed in the IEP may not\n\n 8   be considered in a Burlington/Carter proceeding.”      R.E., 694\n\n 9   F.3d at 186. (emphasis added).     However, the case also\n\n10   expressly “reject[ed] . . . a rigid ‘four corners’ rule\n\n11   prohibiting testimony that goes beyond the face of the IEP.\n\n12   While testimony that materially alters the written plan is\n\n13   not permitted, testimony may be received that explains or\n\n14   justifies the services listed in the IEP.”      Id. (emphasis\n\n15   added).   For example:\n\n16             [I]f an IEP states that a specific\n17             teaching method will be used to instruct a\n18             student, the school district may introduce\n19             testimony at the subsequent hearing to\n20             describe that teaching method and explain\n21             why it was appropriate for the student.\n22             The district, however, may not introduce\n23             testimony that a different teaching\n24             method, not mentioned in the IEP, would\n25             have been used.\n26\n27   Id. at 186-87.\n\n28       Here, Parents contend that the SRO impermissibly\n\n29   credited retrospective testimony that justified the FBA\n\n                                Page 23 of   37\n\f 1   omission based on the BIP’s broad, collaborative support\n\n 2   strategies and how those strategies would change as the\n\n 3   student’s needs changed.     That argument, however, misses the\n\n 4   SRO’s central analysis: the BIP was developed with specific\n\n 5   goals, strategies, and supports, but the collaborative\n\n 6   approach ensured that implementation could change as M.W.’s\n\n 7   needs changed and ensured that behavioral modification\n\n 8   strategies would continue at home.     That seems especially\n\n 9   appropriate when a student’s autism presents unique\n\n10   challenges each day.   Accordingly, the analysis did not rely\n\n11   on retrospective justifications.     The DOE admits that there\n\n12   was no FBA, and the SRO did not rely upon a promise not\n\n13   contained in the IEP to address the omission.\n\n14       The Parents also assert that reliance on Mom’s\n\n15   educational background and the placement school’s counseling\n\n16   programs retrospectively justifies the omission of parental\n\n17   counseling.   But, as we have just stated, when the IEP\n\n18   suffers from a conceded procedural infirmity, we first\n\n19   review whether that procedural violation substantively\n\n20   deprived the student of a FAPE before determining whether\n\n21   the SRO corrected the substantive failure by impermissibly\n\n22   crediting future promises.     In making her determination, the\n\n23   SRO did not conclude that the IEP’s omission of parental\n\n\n                             Page 24 of   37\n\f 1   counseling denied M.W. of a FAPE and that the omission was\n\n 2   made sound by promises not contained in the IEP.        Instead,\n\n 3   the SRO concluded that the parental counseling omission did\n\n 4   not deny M.W. a FAPE in the first instance because of the\n\n 5   BIP’s collaborative approach to behavior modification, Mom’s\n\n 6   education, and the school workshops.        The SRO concluded that\n\n 7   the Parents were equipped to manage M.W.’s needs without New\n\n 8   York’s mandated counseling.     Accordingly, the SRO did not\n\n 9   rely upon impermissible retrospection and we defer to her\n\n10   analysis.\n\n11   III.        Substantive Adequacy and Least Restrictive\n\n12               Environment\n\n13          The Parents also challenge the substantive adequacy of\n\n14   the IEP.     “Substantive inadequacy automatically entitles the\n\n15   parents to reimbursement.”     R.E., 694 F.3d at 190.     The\n\n16   “state need not ‘maximize the potential of handicapped\n\n17   children,’ but the door of public education must be opened\n\n18   in a ‘meaningful way.’”     P. ex. rel. Mr. and Mrs. P. v.\n\n19   Newington Bd. of Educ., 546 F.3d 111, 119 (2d Cir. 2008)\n\n20   (quoting Walczak, 142 F.3d at 130 (internal quotation marks\n\n21   omitted)).     That is, the “IEP must provide the opportunity\n\n22   for more than only ‘trivial advancement.’” Id.\n\n23\n\n\n                               Page 25 of   37\n\f 1\n\n 2       A.   Least Restrictive Environment\n\n 3       The IDEA “expresses a strong preference” for educating\n\n 4   disabled students alongside their non-disabled peers; that\n\n 5   is, in their least restrictive environment (“LRE”).\n\n 6   Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122.   Specifically, the IDEA provides\n\n 7   that disabled children be educated “[t]o the maximum extent\n\n 8   appropriate . . . with children who are not disabled,” and\n\n 9   cautions that “special classes, separate schooling, or other\n\n10   removal of children with disabilities from the regular\n\n11   educational environment” should only occur “when the nature\n\n12   or severity of the disability of a child is such that\n\n13   education in regular classes with the use of supplementary\n\n14   aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.” 20\n\n15   U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n16       “[W]hile mainstreaming is an important objective, we\n\n17   are mindful that the presumption in favor of mainstreaming\n\n18   must be weighed against the importance of providing an\n\n19   appropriate education to handicapped students.”   Newington,\n\n20   546 F.3d at 119 (quotation marks and citation omitted).    The\n\n21   “tension between the IDEA’s goal of providing an education\n\n22   suited to a student’s particular needs and its goal of\n\n23   educating that student with his non-disabled peers as much\n\n\n                            Page 26 of   37\n\f 1   as circumstances allow” dictates a “case-by-case analysis in\n\n 2   reviewing whether both of those goals have been optimally\n\n 3   accommodated under particular circumstances.” Id. (emphasis\n\n 4   added)\n\n 5       We have previously used a two-pronged test to determine\n\n 6   whether a school district has met the LRE mandate mindful of\n\n 7   “our deferential position with respect to state educational\n\n 8   authorities crafting educational policy” when applying it.\n\n 9   Id. at 120.   First, can the student “be satisfactorily\n\n10   educated in the regular classroom, with the use of\n\n11   supplemental aids and services[?]”    Id. at 121.   To answer\n\n12   that question we consider: “(1) whether the school district\n\n13   has made reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in a\n\n14   regular classroom; (2) the educational benefits available to\n\n15   the child in a regular class, with appropriate supplementary\n\n16   aids and services, as compared to the benefits provided in a\n\n17   special education class; and (3) the possible negative\n\n18   effects of the inclusion of the child on the education of\n\n19   the other students.”   Id. at 120.   If a school district\n\n20   actually “remov[es] the child from [a] regular classroom\n\n21   [into] a segregated, special education class,” a second\n\n22   question confronts us: “whether the school has included the\n\n23   child in school programs with nondisabled children to the\n\n\n                             Page 27 of   37\n\f 1   maximum extent appropriate.”      Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n 2   These two questions, however, do not adequately address\n\n 3   M.W.’s placement in a general education environment with\n\n 4   integrated co-teaching services, a placement somewhere in\n\n 5   between a regular classroom and a segregated, special\n\n 6   education classroom.     New York regulations set out the\n\n 7   definition of integrated co-teaching.\n\n 8       “To enable students with disabilities to be educated\n\n 9   with nondisabled students to the maximum extent appropriate,\n\n10   specially designed instruction and supplementary services\n\n11   may be provided in the regular class, including, as\n\n12   appropriate, providing related services, resource room\n\n13   programs and special class programs within the general\n\n14   education classroom.”     N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 §\n\n15   200.6(a)(1).   “A school district may include integrated co-\n\n16   teaching services in its continuum of services.” Id. at §\n\n17   200.6(g).\n\n18       “Integrated co-teaching services means the provision of\n\n19   specially designed instruction and academic instruction\n\n20   provided to a group of students with disabilities and\n\n21   nondisabled students.”     Id.   “The maximum number of students\n\n22   with disabilities receiving integrated co-teaching services\n\n23   in a class shall be determined in accordance with the\n\n\n                               Page 28 of   37\n\f 1   students’ individual needs [and the] number of students with\n\n 2   disabilities in such classes [cannot] exceed 12 students”\n\n 3   unless a variance was provided. Id. at § 200.6(g)(1).         At a\n\n 4   minimum, the classroom must include a special education\n\n 5   teacher and a general education teacher.         Id. at §\n\n 6   200.6(g)(2).    In contrast, a special education classroom is\n\n 7   a “self-contained setting.”     See Id. at § 200.6(h)(4).\n\n 8       The Parents refer repeatedly to an “ICT classroom” and\n\n 9   they assert that the use of ICT services makes M.W.’s\n\n10   placement akin to a segregated special education classroom\n\n11   rather than a regular classroom with supports.         Accordingly,\n\n12   the Parents argue that the DOE failed to consider a regular\n\n13   classroom with additional supports.         Though it is fair to\n\n14   say that a classroom with ICT services is not a “regular\n\n15   classroom,” it is likewise unfair to characterize the\n\n16   placement as a segregated, special-education environment.\n\n17   Newington, however, does not compel a choice between the two\n\n18   extremes of a regular classroom and a special education\n\n19   classroom.     Newington only gives us a test to use when a\n\n20   student is pulled out of a regular classroom and placed in a\n\n21   special education classroom all or some of the time.\n\n22   Accordingly, we do not have to decide whether this is a\n\n23   regular classroom or a special education classroom.         Though\n\n\n                               Page 29 of   37\n\f 1   M.W.’s placement adds a degree of complexity to the LRE test\n\n 2   articulated in Newington, we need only consider whether the\n\n 3   placement of M.W. in a general education environment with a\n\n 4   regular curriculum alongside typically developing peers but\n\n 5   supplemented with a special education teacher was overly\n\n 6   restrictive for M.W.\n\n 7       Both the IEP and the New York regulations characterize\n\n 8   ICT as a service in a general education environment rather\n\n 9   than a special education classroom.       The IEP’s “School\n\n10   Environment and Service Recommendation” would have placed\n\n11   M.W. in a general education environment for all areas of\n\n12   instruction.   ICT was listed as a supplementary aid and\n\n13   service, along with the use of a behavior management\n\n14   paraprofessional and M.W.’s other related services.       The IEP\n\n15   also noted that no areas of instruction were to be in a\n\n16   special-class environment.\n\n17       Moreover, both the IHO and SRO treated ICT as a service\n\n18   and not a special-education classroom.       The IHO concluded\n\n19   that the DOE “failed to present any evidence that an ICT\n\n20   program . . . provided sufficient special education support\n\n21   for [M.W.] in the classroom.”   IHO Decision at 26 (emphasis\n\n22   added).   A close reading of the SRO’s opinion reveals that\n\n23   she also characterized the use of a special education\n\n\n                             Page 30 of   37\n\f 1   teacher, paraprofessional, and related services as\n\n 2   “provid[ing] special education support” and that M.W.\n\n 3   deserved to be in a “general education curriculum” alongside\n\n 4   typically developing peers on account of his high\n\n 5   functionality.   See SRO Decision at 16 (emphasis added).    On\n\n 6   these facts, M.W. has not persuaded us that the ICT services\n\n 7   were too restrictive and the record does not reflect that\n\n 8   New York’s statutory schema incorrectly classifies ICT\n\n 9   services as a placement less restrictive than a segregated,\n\n10   special-education classroom.   Accordingly, we decline to\n\n11   analyze M.W.’s ICT classroom placement as a placement in a\n\n12   special-education classroom.\n\n13       The question then in this case is whether the ICT\n\n14   services were appropriate supports for M.W. within a general\n\n15   education environment.   The Parents contend that a classroom\n\n16   with ICT services was overly restrictive because M.W. had\n\n17   been educated alongside “exclusively non-disabled peers . .\n\n18   . [and that he had proven] that with support, he could ‘make\n\n19   it’ in a far less restrictive environment.”   Br. at 22.    The\n\n20   Parents rely upon the IDEA’s prescription that children be\n\n21   educated with non-disabled children to the maximum extent\n\n22   appropriate, see 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A), whereas the FAPE\n\n23   mandate only requires an “appropriate public education.”\n\n\n                              Page 31 of   37\n\f 1   They assert that any classroom restrictions that result in\n\n 2   raising the educational level afforded to the student beyond\n\n 3   what can be deemed “appropriate” are therefore\n\n 4   impermissible, maintaining that the “test is not whether a\n\n 5   student can learn ‘more’ or learn ‘better’ in a more\n\n 6   restrictive setting, but simply whether the student can\n\n 7   learn ‘satisfactorily’ with aids and services in a less\n\n 8   restrictive environment.” Br. at 22.      Our cases, however, do\n\n 9   not stand for that robust proposition.\n\n10       The IDEA seeks to provide disabled children with a\n\n11   meaningful public education while protecting them from being\n\n12   inappropriately sequestered in a special-education\n\n13   classroom.   Burlington, 471 U.S. at 373 (“Congress was\n\n14   concerned about the apparently widespread practice of\n\n15   relegating handicapped children to private institutions or\n\n16   warehousing them in special classes.”).      Newington\n\n17   recognizes this apparent tension and instructs us to weigh\n\n18   the presumption of mainstreaming against educational\n\n19   benefits obtained in more restrictive settings through a\n\n20   case-by-case analysis that seeks an optimal result across\n\n21   the two requirements.   Moreover, Newington characterized the\n\n22   LRE requirement as a “strong preference” and cautioned that\n\n23   the presumption in favor of mainstreaming must be weighed\n\n\n                             Page 32 of   37\n\f 1   against the importance of providing an appropriate education\n\n 2   to handicapped students; sometimes education in a regular\n\n 3   classroom cannot be achieved satisfactorily.    Newington, 546\n\n 4   F.3d at 119.   But, as just articulated, Newington does not\n\n 5   compel a choice between a regular classroom and a special\n\n 6   education classroom.   Likewise, the IDEA contemplates that\n\n 7   the DOE will consider a continuum of related services and\n\n 8   options that will be a “best fit” for the student in\n\n 9   question.\n\n10       Accordingly, the Parents’ position ignores that we\n\n11   weigh the benefits of a less-restrictive environment against\n\n12   the backdrop of the educational benefits a child can receive\n\n13   in such an environment.    Therefore, we do not assume that\n\n14   moving M.W. from an educational setting where he experienced\n\n15   some progress into a more restrictive setting, ipso facto,\n\n16   warrants tuition reimbursement for a private placement.\n\n17   Instead, we examine whether the preponderance of the\n\n18   evidence supports the SRO’s conclusion that the IEP provided\n\n19   M.W. an appropriate education in his least restrictive\n\n20   environment.\n\n21       The Parents also contend that the addition of ICT\n\n22   services were inappropriate and too restrictive because M.W.\n\n23   would be learning alongside as many as twelve other IEP\n\n\n                               Page 33 of   37\n\f 1   students.    We reject the unsupported assertion that the\n\n 2   restrictiveness of the educational environment and related\n\n 3   services turns exclusively on the number of IEP students\n\n 4   present.    “[T]he objective of providing an education\n\n 5   tailored to each student’s particular needs does not admit\n\n 6   of statistical generalizations.”      Newington, 546 F.3d at\n\n 7   121-22.\n\n 8       Accordingly, we consider whether the ICT services were\n\n 9   overly restrictive along the continuum of services available\n\n10   to M.W. in a general education environment.     The IHO did not\n\n11   make any conclusions or findings regarding the LRE per se.\n\n12   She did, however, conclude in summary fashion that the\n\n13   district “presented no documentary evidence to support the\n\n14   appropriateness of the ICT placement” in light of M.W.’s\n\n15   various developmental problems.    IHO Opinion at 27.    Because\n\n16   the SRO thoroughly addressed the LRE mandate and the\n\n17   appropriateness of the ICT services, we defer to her\n\n18   conclusions.\n\n19       A careful review of the record reveals that M.W.’s\n\n20   autism and related disorders caused behavioral issues that\n\n21   disrupted class and impaired his educational development.\n\n22   Chanie Graus, the psychologist and DOE representative,\n\n23   concluded that M.W. would benefit “from two teachers in the\n\n\n                              Page 34 of   37\n\f 1   classroom versus one [because] it’s really important for\n\n 2   [M.W.] to be exposed to typically developing students, since\n\n 3   he’s under the autistic spectrum, but he’s high\n\n 4   functioning.” Tr. 433-34.        Graus thought that putting M.W.\n\n 5   in a segregated special education classroom “would really be\n\n 6   detrimental to him.”     Id. at 434.     Taking into consideration\n\n 7   his “average I.Q., and that he’s only mildly delayed in\n\n 8   comparison to other students his grade,” Graus said they\n\n 9   wanted M.W. “to be challenged and exposed to a general\n\n10   education curriculum.”     Id.     At the IEP meeting, no one\n\n11   expressed disagreement with the recommendation for an ICT\n\n12   classroom.   Graus also concluded that a regular general\n\n13   education classroom would be inappropriate because of his\n\n14   emotional difficulties and that having a special education\n\n15   teacher would be a benefit.        Id. at 437.\n\n16       A preponderance of the evidence supports the SRO’s\n\n17   conclusions that the IEP recommendation of ICT services in a\n\n18   general education setting was appropriate and reasonable.\n\n19   The DOE was not required to place M.W. in a regular\n\n20   classroom where he was the only IEP student.\n\n21       B.   Length of Program\n\n22       The Parents also argue the DOE’s failure to provide a\n\n23   12-month program denied M.W. a FAPE.         The IHO determined\n\n\n                               Page 35 of    37\n\f 1   that the CSE failed to “justify the elimination of a 12-\n\n 2   month program” and the administrative record did not support\n\n 3   a “reduction in services from a 12-month program to a 10-\n\n 4   month program.” IHO Decision at 26.        The SRO noted that the\n\n 5   IHO “did not cite to any evidentiary basis for her\n\n 6   determination” and concluded that the determination that\n\n 7   “the district’s decision not to offer 12-month services\n\n 8   denied the student a FAPE [was] not supported by the hearing\n\n 9   record.” SRO Decision at 23.    We defer to that conclusion.7\n\n10       The Parents rely exclusively on the IHO’s statement\n\n11   that “the [DOE]’s own witness . . . stated [that] M.W.\n\n12   required a 12-month program” to develop their argument.          See\n\n13   IHO Decision at 26 (citing Tr. at 761) (emphasis added).\n\n14   That reliance is misplaced.    The DOE witness was the special\n\n15   education teacher who would have been leading M.W.’s ICT\n\n16   services and who was not part of the IEP team.        She said\n\n17   that “being a teacher, . . . more is better, and for a child\n\n\n          7\n           The IHO’s misstatements of the record further justify this\n     deference. The IHO credited the “district’s own witness who\n     stated based on her review of the June 10, 2010 IEP [M.W.]\n     required a 12-month program.” IHO Decision at 26. The\n     district’s witness was the special-education teacher who would\n     have ran M.W.’s ICT services. In response to a question whether\n     M.W. would benefit from a 12-month program she merely stated:\n     “Oh, well, being a teacher, I - more is better, and for a child\n     with such deficits, I think a 12 month would be good for this\n     child. Anything to help him, you know.” Tr. 762. She also\n     testified that he would have made progress in a 10-month program.\n     Tr. 770.\n\n                              Page 36 of   37\n\f 1   with such deficits, I think a 12 month [program] would be\n\n 2   good for the child.” Tr. 761 (emphasis added). That\n\n 3   “concession” does not suggest that such a program would be\n\n 4   necessary or required to prevent regression.      Moreover, the\n\n 5   administrative record reveals that regression was not a\n\n 6   topic discussed at the IEP meeting.       See Tr. 638.   Mom\n\n 7   testified that she was not seeking tuition reimbursement for\n\n 8   a 12-month program, only a 10-month program.      Tr. at 1109.\n\n 9   Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the SRO erred in\n\n10   concluding that the absence of 12-month services did not\n\n11   deny M.W. a FAPE. We also do not agree that the cumulative\n\n12   results of the alleged errors resulted in a FAPE denial.\n\n13   See R.E., 694 F.3d at 190.\n\n14       Having considered all of the Parents’ arguments on\n\n15   appeal, we find them to be without merit.      Accordingly, we\n\n16   conclude that the SRO correctly determined that the IEP was\n\n17   substantively adequate and, despite alleged procedural\n\n18   flaws, provided M.W. a FAPE.\n\n19                             Conclusion\n\n20       The district court’s order of June 15, 2012, granting\n\n21   summary judgment for Defendant-Appellee New York City\n\n22   Department of Education is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                             Page 37 of   37\n\f",

Statement of Facts\n\n10       A.      M.W.\n\n11       M.W. is an autistic boy with Pervasive Developmental\n\n12   Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, certain\n\n13   speech and language disorders, and fine and gross motor\n\n14   deficits.    Despite these setbacks, M.W. has an average IQ;\n\n15   he is bright and can learn.    His autism and developmental\n\n16   disorders, however, present behavioral and social-emotional\n\n17   problems that have resulted in academic under-performance\n\n18   and have required speech, occupational, and physical\n\n19   therapies.    M.W. also requires direct, hands-on supervision\n\n20   during the school day from a paraprofessional, who helps him\n\n21   stay focused when his attention strays and calm in the event\n\n22   of a behavioral crisis.\n\n                               Page 5 of   37\n\f 1        After the Parents rejected the IEP for the 2009-2010\n\n 2   school year, M.W. attended Luria, a Montessori school, where\n\n 3   he had the support of his full-time paraprofessional in a\n\n 4   classroom designed for typically developing students.      On\n\n 5   January 30, 2010, Mom sent an email to Luria indicating a\n\n 6   desire to re-enroll M.W. for the 2010-2011 school year\n\n 7   before the CSE developed the contested IEP subject to this\n\n 8   appeal.   Shortly thereafter, Mom submitted an application to\n\n 9   Luria which included a tuition contract and down payment to\n\n10   hold M.W.’s spot.\n\n11        Luria teachers do not use formal assessments to track\n\n12   progress and rely on “a lot [of] note-taking and\n\n13   observation” to track the child’s progress.     See Tr. 937.\n\n14   Though M.W. progressed socially during the 2009-2010 school\n\n15   year, he continued to have “a lot of behavioral issues that\n\n16   [we]re getting in the way of his progress” through the 2010-\n\n17   2011 school year.   Id. at 921.    When these behavioral issues\n\n18   disrupted the class, his paraprofessional removed him from\n\n19   the classroom to work with him outside, sometimes on the\n\n20   floor.2   Id. at 945-50.\n\n\n          2\n             The record does not clearly set out the amount of time\n     M.W. spent outside the classroom during both the 2009-2010 school\n     year and the 2010-2011 school year. For the 2009-2010 school\n\n                                Page 6 of   37\n\f 1        B.     M.W.’s Individualized Education Program\n\n 2         On June 10, 2010, the CSE convened to develop M.W.’s\n\n 3   2010-2011 IEP.    The following individuals constituted the\n\n 4   CSE: (1) Mom; (2) Sara Malasky, M.W.’s general education\n\n 5   teacher, who participated via telephone; (3) Chanie Graus, a\n\n 6   school psychologist who acted as a school-district\n\n 7   representative; (4) a special education teacher; and (5) a\n\n 8   parent representative.    M.W. was seven years old, and the\n\n 9   IEP was for his second-grade year, 2010-2011.\n\n10        The IEP described M.W. as a seven-year-old autistic\n\n11   child of average intelligence with Pervasive Developmental\n\n12   Disorder.    Despite his disorders, the IEP recognized that\n\n13   M.W. had “made progress . . . in the area of peer\n\n14   interactions” and, during the previous year at Luria, M.W.\n\n15   had made friends and was “able to participate in a\n\n\n     year, M.W.’s Floor Time therapist worked with him outside the\n     classroom. When sent to observe M.W. before the CSE meeting that\n     produced the challenged IEP, the DOE representative observed M.W.\n     on the hallway floor having an emotional breakdown during his\n     Floor Time therapy. Around September of the 2010-2011 school\n     year, M.W. developed Tourette Syndrome which caused a frequently\n     disruptive tic. For that year, M.W. spent a significant amount\n     of time outside of the classroom to work one-on-one with his\n     paraprofessional as needed to control his disruptions. See Tr.\n     816, 824-25, 845-46, 854, 939, 945-50. Additionally, M.W.’s\n     teacher and paraprofessional would plan ahead to have him removed\n     from the classroom for instruction, sometimes with another\n     student.

The IEP, however, also noted\n\n 3   that M.W. had significant self-regulation difficulties,\n\n 4   became frustrated easily, and struggled to calm himself down\n\n 5   in the event of a behavioral crisis.       Id.\n\n 6        The IEP recommended placement in a general education\n\n 7   environment with integrated co-teaching (“ICT”) services\n\n 8   with a 12:1 staffing ratio, five days a week, for a ten-\n\n 9   month school year.3    The IEP also provided M.W. with a full-\n\n10   time behavioral management paraprofessional to give him one-\n\n11   on-one help self-regulating in times of behavioral crisis,\n\n12   and these other related services:\n\n13       Service                Sessions x Week       Duration   Students\n14   1   Counseling             1 x week              30 mins.   3\n15   2   Occupational           3 x week              30 mins.   1\n         Therapy\n16   3   Physical Therapy       2 x week              30 mins.   1\n17   4   Speech/Language        2 x week              30 mins.   1\n         Therapy\n\n\n\n\n          3\n             The 12:1 staffing ratio means that one special education\n     teacher would provide ICT services for up to twelve IEP students,\n     the statutory maximum, in a classroom that also included\n     typically developing students, a general education curriculum,\n     and a general education teacher.

Based on those\n\n 6   conclusions, the IEP required a behavioral intervention plan\n\n 7   (“BIP”), which was incorporated in the IEP.       Id. at 1860.\n\n 8   The BIP identified “emotional meltdowns,” “poor self-\n\n 9   regulation,” and “poor attention” as the behavioral\n\n10   difficulties that impaired M.W.’s academic progress and\n\n11   recommended a reward system, praise and encouragement, and\n\n12   positive modeling as strategies to modify those behaviors.\n\n13   Id. at 1862.    The goal was to teach M.W. to become more\n\n14   attentive and focused and to better control himself when\n\n15   frustrated.    Id.   To implement those strategies, M.W.’s\n\n16   teacher, paraprofessional, and the Parents were to\n\n17   collaborate.   The BIP did not quantify data relating to the\n\n18   frequency of M.W.’s “meltdowns” because Luria did not\n\n19   provide a functional behavior assessment (“FBA”), and the\n\n20   DOE did not request or develop one.\n\n21       On July 1, 2010, the DOE sent a letter to M.W.’s\n\n22   Parents that classified M.W. as an autistic student and\n\n                                Page 9 of   37\n\f 1   recommended an ICT classroom4 at P.S. 197, the Ocean School,\n\n 2   with the related services that the IEP recommended.      Mom\n\n 3   visited the school, decided to keep M.W. at Luria, and\n\n 4   immediately began the administrative-review process seeking\n\n 5   reimbursement for the 2010-2011 school year.\n\n 6        C.   Administrative Review\n\n 7        On July 8, 2010, the Parents filed their demand for due\n\n 8   process and requested a hearing.      The Parents subsequently\n\n 9   amended their demands on September 29, 2010.      On May 2,\n\n10   2011, the Parents submitted their closing brief after 12\n\n11   hearing days that took place over the entire school year.\n\n12   In relevant parts, the Parents argued that the IEP would\n\n13   have denied M.W. a FAPE because the IEP Team created a BIP\n\n14   without the benefit of an FBA and the IEP failed to provide\n\n15   parent counseling and training as a related service.      The\n\n16   Parents also argued that the P.S. 197 placement was\n\n17   defective because the recommended 10-month program exposed\n\n18\n\n\n          4\n             The letter actually recommended Collaborative Team\n     Teaching (“CTT”). CTT is equivalent to ICT. See\n     http://www.p12.nysed.gov/specialed/publications/policy/schoolagec\n     ontinuum.html (“New York City (NYC) has used the term\n     ‘collaborative team teaching’ (CTT) to identify a service that\n     meets the regulatory definition of integrated co-teaching\n     services.”). In any event, the parties do not mention or argue\n     over this distinction.\n\n                              Page 10 of   37\n\f 1   M.W. to regression risks.    Finally, the Parents argued that\n\n 2   the IEP assigned M.W. to an overly restrictive environment.\n\n 3       The IHO expressly agreed with the Parents regarding the\n\n 4   BIP, the omission of parental counseling, and the inadequacy\n\n 5   of a 10-month program.    Though the IHO mentioned the least\n\n 6   restrictive environment requirement in passing, she made no\n\n 7   explicit findings as to whether a general education\n\n 8   environment with ICT services would be too restrictive.5\n\n 9   See Sealed App’x 2155.    The IHO found Luria to be an\n\n10   appropriate placement and that the equities favored the\n\n11   Parents.    Accordingly, the IHO ordered that the Parents be\n\n12   reimbursed, and the DOE sought review by a SRO.    The SRO\n\n13   reversed the IHO’s determinations and denied tuition\n\n14   reimbursement.    Relying heavily on the SRO’s analysis, the\n\n15   district court affirmed that decision, and the Parents\n\n16   appealed.\n\n17\n\n18\n\n\n         5\n             The IHO found that the ICT classroom, generally, was\n     inappropriate because the class size was too large and the\n     decision to make that placement was unsupported by documentary\n     evidence. IHO Decision at 27. The IHO also summarily concluded\n     that ICT service was an inappropriate support system for M.W.’s\n     developmental problems. Id. Those criticisms, however, were not\n     tied to a restrictiveness analysis and offer no insight into\n     Parents’ least restrictive environment arguments on appeal.\n\n                              Page 11 of   37\n\f 1                               Discussion\n\n 2   I.

See id.\n\n 7   Accordingly, an appellant seeking to have a reviewing court\n\n 8   credit an IHO’s determination over an SRO’s determination\n\n 9   would benefit from calling our attention to an SRO’s\n\n10   specific errors in law, fact, or reasoning.6\n\n11   II. Procedural Violations\n\n12       “In determining whether an IEP complies with the IDEA,\n\n13   courts make a two-part inquiry that is, first, procedural,\n\n14   and second, substantive.”     Id. at 189-90.   Procedural\n\n15   violations warrant tuition reimbursement only if they\n\n16   “‘impeded the child’s right to a [FAPE],’ ‘significantly\n\n17   impeded the parents’ opportunity to participate in the\n\n18   decision[-]making process,’ or ‘caused a deprivation of\n\n19   educational benefits.’”     Id. at 190 (quoting 20 U.S.C. §\n\n20   1415(f)(3)(E)(ii); A.C., 553 F.3d at 172).     That is, parents\n\n\n         6\n           By attempting to undercut the deference owed to the SRO\n     based on her alleged personal inexperience, Parents’ counsel\n     moved us to (re)articulate these guiding principles. See Compl.\n     at 8, ¶ 23.\n\n                               Page 14 of   37\n\f 1   must articulate how a procedural violation resulted in the\n\n 2   IEP’s substantive inadequacy or affected the decision-making\n\n 3   process.    Of course, “[m]ultiple procedural violations may\n\n 4   cumulatively result in the denial of a FAPE even if the\n\n 5   violations considered individually do not.”         Id.\n\n 6       Here, the Parents allege that the DOE committed two\n\n 7   procedural violations: it failed to undertake an FBA in\n\n 8   developing the BIP and it failed to include parental\n\n 9   training and counseling in the IEP.         The Parents also assert\n\n10   that the SRO impermissibly relied on retrospective testimony\n\n11   to justify those omissions.\n\n12       A.      Behavioral Intervention Plan\n\n13       An FBA provides an “identification of [a disabled\n\n14   student’s] problem behavior, the definition of the behavior\n\n15   in concrete terms, the identification of the contextual\n\n16   factors that contribute to the behavior . . . and the\n\n17   formulation of a hypothesis regarding the general conditions\n\n18   under which a behavior usually occurs and probable\n\n19   consequences that serve to maintain it.”         N.Y.

Those\n\n 2   regulations, however, only require an FBA “as necessary to\n\n 3   ascertain the physical, mental, behavioral and emotional\n\n 4   factors which contribute to [a] suspected disabilit[y].”\n\n 5   N.Y.

Kain ex rel.\n\n12   Kain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797670\"><a href=\"/opinion/797670/bay-shore-union-free-school-district-plaintiff-counter-defendant-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 734 (2d Cir. 2007)).     The IDEA only\n\n13   requires a school district to “consider the use of positive\n\n14   behavioral interventions and supports, and other strategies”\n\n15   when a child’s behavior impedes learning.      See id. at 172\n\n16   (quoting 20 U.S.C. § 1414(d)(3)(B)(i)) (internal quotation\n\n17   marks omitted).    An FBA omission does, however, cause us to\n\n18   “take particular care to ensure that the IEP adequately\n\n19   addresses the child’s problem behaviors.”      R.E., 694 F.3d at\n\n20   190.    Two cases chart our course.    See R.E., 694 F.3d at\n\n21   192-95; A.C., 553 F.3d at 172-73.\n\n22          In A.C., we concluded that the failure to conduct an\n\n23   FBA did not make an IEP legally inadequate because it noted\n\n\n                               Page 16 of   37\n\f 1   (1) the student’s attention problems; (2) the student’s need\n\n 2   for a personal aide to help the student focus during class;\n\n 3   and (3) the student’s need for psychiatric and psychological\n\n 4   services.    A.C., 553 F.3d at 172.    In R.E. we considered the\n\n 5   effect of an FBA omission for three separate students.       See\n\n 6   R.E., 694 F.3d at 192-95.    For one student, we concluded\n\n 7   that an FBA omission did not deny a FAPE where (1) the CSE\n\n 8   reviewed documents regarding the student’s behavior, and (2)\n\n 9   the IEP provided strategies to address those behaviors,\n\n10   “including the use of a 1:1 aide to help him focus.”      Id. at\n\n11   193.    Moreover, we have decided that whether an IEP\n\n12   adequately addresses a disabled student’s behaviors and\n\n13   whether strategies for dealing with those behaviors are\n\n14   appropriate are “precisely the type of issue[s] upon which\n\n15   the IDEA requires deference to the expertise of the\n\n16   administrative officers.”    A.C., 553 F.3d at 172 (quoting\n\n17   Grim v. Rhinebeck Cent. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783833\"><a href=\"/opinion/783833/joan-grim-and-steven-grim-parents-of-a-disabled-child-chelsea-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382 (2d\n\n18   Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n19          Failure to conduct an FBA, therefore, does not render\n\n20   an IEP legally inadequate under the IDEA so long as the IEP\n\n21   adequately identifies a student’s behavioral impediments and\n\n22   implements strategies to address that behavior.      See, e.g.,\n\n23   id.    Where the IEP actually includes a BIP, parents should\n\n\n                               Page 17 of   37\n\f 1   at least suggest how the lack of an FBA resulted in the\n\n 2   BIP’s inadequacy or prevented meaningful decision-making.\n\n 3   See R.E. at 189-90.     For example, parents could argue that\n\n 4   an FBA would have exposed a BIP’s obsolete assessment of the\n\n 5   student’s behavioral problems or that the recommended\n\n 6   behavior-modification strategies failed to accommodate the\n\n 7   frequency or intensity of the student’s behavioral problems.\n\n 8    Here, however, the Parents summarily argue that failure to\n\n 9   conduct an FBA made the IEP legally defective; the record\n\n10   belies those assertions.\n\n11       As an initial matter, the IHO’s FBA and BIP analysis\n\n12   consisted of a single sentence without citation to the\n\n13   administrative record: “Lastly, I find there was no FBA\n\n14   developed and the BIP was developed without parent or\n\n15   teacher involvement and I find the BIP was not appropriate.”\n\n16   IHO Decision at 28.     By contrast, the SRO provided an in-\n\n17   depth, four-page discussion of the issue replete with legal\n\n18   and factual analysis.     See SRO Decision at 17-20.   The SRO\n\n19   found that the IHO’s finding was unsubstantiated by a record\n\n20   which clearly established M.W.’s behavioral problems,\n\n21   identified strategies to manage those problems, and\n\n22   recommended a collaborative intervention plan between the\n\n23   Parents, teacher, and paraprofessional.\n\n\n                               Page 18 of   37\n\f 1       The SRO concluded that the BIP accurately described the\n\n 2   behaviors that interfered with learning: “emotional\n\n 3   meltdowns,” poor self-regulation, and poor attention.     In\n\n 4   support of her analysis, the SRO relied upon, inter alia,\n\n 5   the Luria progress reports, the Floor Time therapist’s\n\n 6   report, and Graus’s in-class observations of M.W., all of\n\n 7   which describe those behavioral difficulties in detail.        See\n\n 8   SRO Decision at 19 (citing Dist. Ex. 5-12).    The Parents\n\n 9   confirm the accuracy of those descriptions and do not\n\n10   contend that the IEP misidentified or overlooked their son’s\n\n11   behavioral issues.   See Parents’ Local Rule 56.1 Statement\n\n12   of Material Facts ¶ 5.    Accordingly, we agree with the SRO’s\n\n13   determination that the BIP adequately described M.W.’s\n\n14   behavioral impediments.\n\n15       The SRO also concluded that the BIP was consistent with\n\n16   the information available to the CSE and that the\n\n17   intervention services were adequate because they provided a\n\n18   broad, collaborative approach to implement specific\n\n19   strategies to modify those behaviors on a daily, one-on-one\n\n20   basis.   The Parents do not contend that M.W. needed more or\n\n21   less attention.   Additionally, the BIP recommended that M.W.\n\n22   be provided with a reward system, praise, encouragement, and\n\n23   positive modeling to learn to adjust his behavior within a\n\n\n                               Page 19 of   37\n\f 1   collaborative support system between parent, teacher, and\n\n 2   paraprofessional.    The Parents do not attack those\n\n 3   strategies.    The Parents have simply failed to articulate a\n\n 4   single reason why an FBA was required for a legally valid\n\n 5   BIP.\n\n 6          We therefore affirm the SRO’s determination that the\n\n 7   “hearing record does not support the impartial hearing\n\n 8   officer’s determination that the lack of an FBA rose to the\n\n 9   level of denying the student a FAPE where the IEP addressed\n\n10   behavioral needs.” SRO Decision at 20.      As in R.E., (1) the\n\n11   CSE reviewed documents regarding the student’s behavior, and\n\n12   (2) the IEP provided strategies to address those behaviors,\n\n13   including the use of a paraprofessional.      R.E., 694 F.3d at\n\n14   193.\n\n15          B.   Parental Counseling\n\n16          Next, the Parents argue that the IEP’s failure to\n\n17   include parental counseling denied M.W. a FAPE.      To enable\n\n18   parents to “perform appropriate follow-up intervention\n\n19   activities at home,” New York requires that an IEP provide\n\n20   parents of autistic students training and counseling.      See\n\n21   N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.13(d).     “Parent\n\n22   counseling and training means assisting parents in\n\n23   understanding the special needs of their child; providing\n\n\n                               Page 20 of   37\n\f 1   parents with information about child development; and\n\n 2   helping parents to acquire the necessary skills that will\n\n 3   allow them to support the implementation of their child’s\n\n 4   individualized education program.”     Id. § 200.1(kk)\n\n 5   (emphasis omitted).   The regulations contemplate parental\n\n 6   counseling for the educational benefit of the disabled\n\n 7   student by ensuring that the parents are equipped with the\n\n 8   skills and knowledge necessary to continue and implement the\n\n 9   student’s IEP at home.\n\n10       We have previously described counseling omissions as\n\n11   procedural violations “less serious than the omission of an\n\n12   FBA” because “the presence or absence of a parent-counseling\n\n13   provision does not necessarily have a direct effect on the\n\n14   substantive adequacy of the plan.”     R.E., 694 F.3d at 191.\n\n15   “Moreover, because school districts are required . . . to\n\n16   provide parent counseling, they remain accountable for their\n\n17   failure to do so no matter the contents of the IEP.”     Id.\n\n18   (citing N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 § 200.13(d)).\n\n19   If a parent wants counseling for her own sake, New York\n\n20   provides her a remedy.   Accordingly, failure to provide\n\n21   counseling ordinarily does not result in a FAPE denial or\n\n22   warrant tuition reimbursement.   See id.\n\n23\n\n\n                              Page 21 of   37\n\f 1         Here, the IHO again summarily decided that parent\n\n 2   counseling and training was required and that parent\n\n 3   workshops that would have been provided to the Parents by\n\n 4   the Ocean School would not give the Parents the tools\n\n 5   necessary to perform follow-up at home.     IHO Decision at 27-\n\n 6   28.   The IHO, however, did not explain those conclusions.\n\n 7   The SRO concluded that the counseling omission did not deny\n\n 8   M.W. a FAPE because Mom was a certified special education\n\n 9   teacher who had received, through her own initiative,\n\n10   training and counseling in the therapies that M.W. had\n\n11   previously used, and because the public school assigned to\n\n12   M.W. provided training and counseling.     The SRO also noted\n\n13   that the BIP required collaboration between\n\n14   paraprofessional, the Parents, and teacher in order to\n\n15   implement and support the recommended behavior-modification\n\n16   strategies.\n\n17         We defer to that analysis.   The Parents have not\n\n18   persuaded us that the parental counseling omission would\n\n19   deprive M.W. of FAPE.   The SRO’s analysis noted that Mom’s\n\n20   experience and the supports in the BIP provide adequate\n\n21   assurance that M.W.’s developmental plan and education would\n\n22   continue at home.\n\n23\n\n\n\n                              Page 22 of   37\n\f 1\n\n 2       C.    Retrospective Justifications\n\n 3       The Parents assert that the SRO routinely relied upon\n\n 4   impermissible retrospective justifications to fill in the\n\n 5   IEP’s inadequacies.      In R.E., we held “that retrospective\n\n 6   testimony that the school district would have provided\n\n 7   additional services beyond those listed in the IEP may not\n\n 8   be considered in a Burlington/Carter proceeding.”      R.E., 694\n\n 9   F.3d at 186. (emphasis added).     However, the case also\n\n10   expressly “reject[ed] . . . a rigid ‘four corners’ rule\n\n11   prohibiting testimony that goes beyond the face of the IEP.\n\n12   While testimony that materially alters the written plan is\n\n13   not permitted, testimony may be received that explains or\n\n14   justifies the services listed in the IEP.”      Id. (emphasis\n\n15   added).   For example:\n\n16             [I]f an IEP states that a specific\n17             teaching method will be used to instruct a\n18             student, the school district may introduce\n19             testimony at the subsequent hearing to\n20             describe that teaching method and explain\n21             why it was appropriate for the student.\n22             The district, however, may not introduce\n23             testimony that a different teaching\n24             method, not mentioned in the IEP, would\n25             have been used.\n26\n27   Id. at 186-87.\n\n28       Here, Parents contend that the SRO impermissibly\n\n29   credited retrospective testimony that justified the FBA\n\n                                Page 23 of   37\n\f 1   omission based on the BIP’s broad, collaborative support\n\n 2   strategies and how those strategies would change as the\n\n 3   student’s needs changed.     That argument, however, misses the\n\n 4   SRO’s central analysis: the BIP was developed with specific\n\n 5   goals, strategies, and supports, but the collaborative\n\n 6   approach ensured that implementation could change as M.W.’s\n\n 7   needs changed and ensured that behavioral modification\n\n 8   strategies would continue at home.     That seems especially\n\n 9   appropriate when a student’s autism presents unique\n\n10   challenges each day.   Accordingly, the analysis did not rely\n\n11   on retrospective justifications.     The DOE admits that there\n\n12   was no FBA, and the SRO did not rely upon a promise not\n\n13   contained in the IEP to address the omission.\n\n14       The Parents also assert that reliance on Mom’s\n\n15   educational background and the placement school’s counseling\n\n16   programs retrospectively justifies the omission of parental\n\n17   counseling.   But, as we have just stated, when the IEP\n\n18   suffers from a conceded procedural infirmity, we first\n\n19   review whether that procedural violation substantively\n\n20   deprived the student of a FAPE before determining whether\n\n21   the SRO corrected the substantive failure by impermissibly\n\n22   crediting future promises.     In making her determination, the\n\n23   SRO did not conclude that the IEP’s omission of parental\n\n\n                             Page 24 of   37\n\f 1   counseling denied M.W. of a FAPE and that the omission was\n\n 2   made sound by promises not contained in the IEP.        Instead,\n\n 3   the SRO concluded that the parental counseling omission did\n\n 4   not deny M.W. a FAPE in the first instance because of the\n\n 5   BIP’s collaborative approach to behavior modification, Mom’s\n\n 6   education, and the school workshops.        The SRO concluded that\n\n 7   the Parents were equipped to manage M.W.’s needs without New\n\n 8   York’s mandated counseling.     Accordingly, the SRO did not\n\n 9   rely upon impermissible retrospection and we defer to her\n\n10   analysis.\n\n11   III.        Substantive Adequacy and Least Restrictive\n\n12               Environment\n\n13          The Parents also challenge the substantive adequacy of\n\n14   the IEP.     “Substantive inadequacy automatically entitles the\n\n15   parents to reimbursement.”     R.E., 694 F.3d at 190.     The\n\n16   “state need not ‘maximize the potential of handicapped\n\n17   children,’ but the door of public education must be opened\n\n18   in a ‘meaningful way.’”     P. ex. rel.

That is, the “IEP must provide the opportunity\n\n22   for more than only ‘trivial advancement.’” Id.\n\n23\n\n\n                               Page 25 of   37\n\f 1\n\n 2       A.   Least Restrictive Environment\n\n 3       The IDEA “expresses a strong preference” for educating\n\n 4   disabled students alongside their non-disabled peers; that\n\n 5   is, in their least restrictive environment (“LRE”).\n\n 6   Walczak, 142 F.3d at 122.   Specifically, the IDEA provides\n\n 7   that disabled children be educated “[t]o the maximum extent\n\n 8   appropriate . . . with children who are not disabled,” and\n\n 9   cautions that “special classes, separate schooling, or other\n\n10   removal of children with disabilities from the regular\n\n11   educational environment” should only occur “when the nature\n\n12   or severity of the disability of a child is such that\n\n13   education in regular classes with the use of supplementary\n\n14   aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.” 20\n\n15   U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A) (emphasis added).\n\n16       “[W]hile mainstreaming is an important objective, we\n\n17   are mindful that the presumption in favor of mainstreaming\n\n18   must be weighed against the importance of providing an\n\n19   appropriate education to handicapped students.”   Newington,\n\n20   546 F.3d at 119 (quotation marks and citation omitted).    The\n\n21   “tension between the IDEA’s goal of providing an education\n\n22   suited to a student’s particular needs and its goal of\n\n23   educating that student with his non-disabled peers as much\n\n\n                            Page 26 of   37\n\f 1   as circumstances allow” dictates a “case-by-case analysis in\n\n 2   reviewing whether both of those goals have been optimally\n\n 3   accommodated under particular circumstances.” Id. (emphasis\n\n 4   added)\n\n 5       We have previously used a two-pronged test to determine\n\n 6   whether a school district has met the LRE mandate mindful of\n\n 7   “our deferential position with respect to state educational\n\n 8   authorities crafting educational policy” when applying it.\n\n 9   Id. at 120.   First, can the student “be satisfactorily\n\n10   educated in the regular classroom, with the use of\n\n11   supplemental aids and services[?]”    Id. at 121.   To answer\n\n12   that question we consider: “(1) whether the school district\n\n13   has made reasonable efforts to accommodate the child in a\n\n14   regular classroom; (2) the educational benefits available to\n\n15   the child in a regular class, with appropriate supplementary\n\n16   aids and services, as compared to the benefits provided in a\n\n17   special education class; and (3) the possible negative\n\n18   effects of the inclusion of the child on the education of\n\n19   the other students.”   Id. at 120.   If a school district\n\n20   actually “remov[es] the child from [a] regular classroom\n\n21   [into] a segregated, special education class,” a second\n\n22   question confronts us: “whether the school has included the\n\n23   child in school programs with nondisabled children to the\n\n\n                             Page 27 of   37\n\f 1   maximum extent appropriate.”      Id. (quotation omitted).\n\n 2   These two questions, however, do not adequately address\n\n 3   M.W.’s placement in a general education environment with\n\n 4   integrated co-teaching services, a placement somewhere in\n\n 5   between a regular classroom and a segregated, special\n\n 6   education classroom.     New York regulations set out the\n\n 7   definition of integrated co-teaching.\n\n 8       “To enable students with disabilities to be educated\n\n 9   with nondisabled students to the maximum extent appropriate,\n\n10   specially designed instruction and supplementary services\n\n11   may be provided in the regular class, including, as\n\n12   appropriate, providing related services, resource room\n\n13   programs and special class programs within the general\n\n14   education classroom.”     N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 8 §\n\n15   200.6(a)(1).   “A school district may include integrated co-\n\n16   teaching services in its continuum of services.” Id. at §\n\n17   200.6(g).\n\n18       “Integrated co-teaching services means the provision of\n\n19   specially designed instruction and academic instruction\n\n20   provided to a group of students with disabilities and\n\n21   nondisabled students.”     Id.   “The maximum number of students\n\n22   with disabilities receiving integrated co-teaching services\n\n23   in a class shall be determined in accordance with the\n\n\n                               Page 28 of   37\n\f 1   students’ individual needs [and the] number of students with\n\n 2   disabilities in such classes [cannot] exceed 12 students”\n\n 3   unless a variance was provided. Id. at § 200.6(g)(1).         At a\n\n 4   minimum, the classroom must include a special education\n\n 5   teacher and a general education teacher.         Id. at §\n\n 6   200.6(g)(2).    In contrast, a special education classroom is\n\n 7   a “self-contained setting.”     See Id. at § 200.6(h)(4).\n\n 8       The Parents refer repeatedly to an “ICT classroom” and\n\n 9   they assert that the use of ICT services makes M.W.’s\n\n10   placement akin to a segregated special education classroom\n\n11   rather than a regular classroom with supports.         Accordingly,\n\n12   the Parents argue that the DOE failed to consider a regular\n\n13   classroom with additional supports.         Though it is fair to\n\n14   say that a classroom with ICT services is not a “regular\n\n15   classroom,” it is likewise unfair to characterize the\n\n16   placement as a segregated, special-education environment.\n\n17   Newington, however, does not compel a choice between the two\n\n18   extremes of a regular classroom and a special education\n\n19   classroom.     Newington only gives us a test to use when a\n\n20   student is pulled out of a regular classroom and placed in a\n\n21   special education classroom all or some of the time.\n\n22   Accordingly, we do not have to decide whether this is a\n\n23   regular classroom or a special education classroom.         Though\n\n\n                               Page 29 of   37\n\f 1   M.W.’s placement adds a degree of complexity to the LRE test\n\n 2   articulated in Newington, we need only consider whether the\n\n 3   placement of M.W. in a general education environment with a\n\n 4   regular curriculum alongside typically developing peers but\n\n 5   supplemented with a special education teacher was overly\n\n 6   restrictive for M.W.\n\n 7       Both the IEP and the New York regulations characterize\n\n 8   ICT as a service in a general education environment rather\n\n 9   than a special education classroom.       The IEP’s “School\n\n10   Environment and Service Recommendation” would have placed\n\n11   M.W. in a general education environment for all areas of\n\n12   instruction.   ICT was listed as a supplementary aid and\n\n13   service, along with the use of a behavior management\n\n14   paraprofessional and M.W.’s other related services.       The IEP\n\n15   also noted that no areas of instruction were to be in a\n\n16   special-class environment.\n\n17       Moreover, both the IHO and SRO treated ICT as a service\n\n18   and not a special-education classroom.       The IHO concluded\n\n19   that the DOE “failed to present any evidence that an ICT\n\n20   program . . . provided sufficient special education support\n\n21   for [M.W.] in the classroom.”   IHO Decision at 26 (emphasis\n\n22   added).   A close reading of the SRO’s opinion reveals that\n\n23   she also characterized the use of a special education\n\n\n                             Page 30 of   37\n\f 1   teacher, paraprofessional, and related services as\n\n 2   “provid[ing] special education support” and that M.W.\n\n 3   deserved to be in a “general education curriculum” alongside\n\n 4   typically developing peers on account of his high\n\n 5   functionality.   See SRO Decision at 16 (emphasis added).    On\n\n 6   these facts, M.W. has not persuaded us that the ICT services\n\n 7   were too restrictive and the record does not reflect that\n\n 8   New York’s statutory schema incorrectly classifies ICT\n\n 9   services as a placement less restrictive than a segregated,\n\n10   special-education classroom.   Accordingly, we decline to\n\n11   analyze M.W.’s ICT classroom placement as a placement in a\n\n12   special-education classroom.\n\n13       The question then in this case is whether the ICT\n\n14   services were appropriate supports for M.W. within a general\n\n15   education environment.   The Parents contend that a classroom\n\n16   with ICT services was overly restrictive because M.W. had\n\n17   been educated alongside “exclusively non-disabled peers . .\n\n18   . [and that he had proven] that with support, he could ‘make\n\n19   it’ in a far less restrictive environment.”   Br. at 22.    The\n\n20   Parents rely upon the IDEA’s prescription that children be\n\n21   educated with non-disabled children to the maximum extent\n\n22   appropriate, see 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A), whereas the FAPE\n\n23   mandate only requires an “appropriate public education.”\n\n\n                              Page 31 of   37\n\f 1   They assert that any classroom restrictions that result in\n\n 2   raising the educational level afforded to the student beyond\n\n 3   what can be deemed “appropriate” are therefore\n\n 4   impermissible, maintaining that the “test is not whether a\n\n 5   student can learn ‘more’ or learn ‘better’ in a more\n\n 6   restrictive setting, but simply whether the student can\n\n 7   learn ‘satisfactorily’ with aids and services in a less\n\n 8   restrictive environment.” Br. at 22.      Our cases, however, do\n\n 9   not stand for that robust proposition.\n\n10       The IDEA seeks to provide disabled children with a\n\n11   meaningful public education while protecting them from being\n\n12   inappropriately sequestered in a special-education\n\n13   classroom.   Burlington, 471 U.S. at 373 (“Congress was\n\n14   concerned about the apparently widespread practice of\n\n15   relegating handicapped children to private institutions or\n\n16   warehousing them in special classes.”).      Newington\n\n17   recognizes this apparent tension and instructs us to weigh\n\n18   the presumption of mainstreaming against educational\n\n19   benefits obtained in more restrictive settings through a\n\n20   case-by-case analysis that seeks an optimal result across\n\n21   the two requirements.   Moreover, Newington characterized the\n\n22   LRE requirement as a “strong preference” and cautioned that\n\n23   the presumption in favor of mainstreaming must be weighed\n\n\n                             Page 32 of   37\n\f 1   against the importance of providing an appropriate education\n\n 2   to handicapped students; sometimes education in a regular\n\n 3   classroom cannot be achieved satisfactorily.    Newington, 546\n\n 4   F.3d at 119.   But, as just articulated, Newington does not\n\n 5   compel a choice between a regular classroom and a special\n\n 6   education classroom.   Likewise, the IDEA contemplates that\n\n 7   the DOE will consider a continuum of related services and\n\n 8   options that will be a “best fit” for the student in\n\n 9   question.\n\n10       Accordingly, the Parents’ position ignores that we\n\n11   weigh the benefits of a less-restrictive environment against\n\n12   the backdrop of the educational benefits a child can receive\n\n13   in such an environment.    Therefore, we do not assume that\n\n14   moving M.W. from an educational setting where he experienced\n\n15   some progress into a more restrictive setting, ipso facto,\n\n16   warrants tuition reimbursement for a private placement.\n\n17   Instead, we examine whether the preponderance of the\n\n18   evidence supports the SRO’s conclusion that the IEP provided\n\n19   M.W. an appropriate education in his least restrictive\n\n20   environment.\n\n21       The Parents also contend that the addition of ICT\n\n22   services were inappropriate and too restrictive because M.W.\n\n23   would be learning alongside as many as twelve other IEP\n\n\n                               Page 33 of   37\n\f 1   students.    We reject the unsupported assertion that the\n\n 2   restrictiveness of the educational environment and related\n\n 3   services turns exclusively on the number of IEP students\n\n 4   present.    “[T]he objective of providing an education\n\n 5   tailored to each student’s particular needs does not admit\n\n 6   of statistical generalizations.”      Newington, 546 F.3d at\n\n 7   121-22.\n\n 8       Accordingly, we consider whether the ICT services were\n\n 9   overly restrictive along the continuum of services available\n\n10   to M.W. in a general education environment.     The IHO did not\n\n11   make any conclusions or findings regarding the LRE per se.\n\n12   She did, however, conclude in summary fashion that the\n\n13   district “presented no documentary evidence to support the\n\n14   appropriateness of the ICT placement” in light of M.W.’s\n\n15   various developmental problems.    IHO Opinion at 27.    Because\n\n16   the SRO thoroughly addressed the LRE mandate and the\n\n17   appropriateness of the ICT services, we defer to her\n\n18   conclusions.\n\n19       A careful review of the record reveals that M.W.’s\n\n20   autism and related disorders caused behavioral issues that\n\n21   disrupted class and impaired his educational development.\n\n22   Chanie Graus, the psychologist and DOE representative,\n\n23   concluded that M.W. would benefit “from two teachers in the\n\n\n                              Page 34 of   37\n\f 1   classroom versus one [because] it’s really important for\n\n 2   [M.W.] to be exposed to typically developing students, since\n\n 3   he’s under the autistic spectrum, but he’s high\n\n 4   functioning.” Tr. 433-34.        Graus thought that putting M.W.\n\n 5   in a segregated special education classroom “would really be\n\n 6   detrimental to him.”     Id. at 434.     Taking into consideration\n\n 7   his “average I.Q., and that he’s only mildly delayed in\n\n 8   comparison to other students his grade,” Graus said they\n\n 9   wanted M.W. “to be challenged and exposed to a general\n\n10   education curriculum.”     Id.     At the IEP meeting, no one\n\n11   expressed disagreement with the recommendation for an ICT\n\n12   classroom.   Graus also concluded that a regular general\n\n13   education classroom would be inappropriate because of his\n\n14   emotional difficulties and that having a special education\n\n15   teacher would be a benefit.        Id. at 437.\n\n16       A preponderance of the evidence supports the SRO’s\n\n17   conclusions that the IEP recommendation of ICT services in a\n\n18   general education setting was appropriate and reasonable.\n\n19   The DOE was not required to place M.W. in a regular\n\n20   classroom where he was the only IEP student.\n\n21       B.   Length of Program\n\n22       The Parents also argue the DOE’s failure to provide a\n\n23   12-month program denied M.W. a FAPE.         The IHO determined\n\n\n                               Page 35 of    37\n\f 1   that the CSE failed to “justify the elimination of a 12-\n\n 2   month program” and the administrative record did not support\n\n 3   a “reduction in services from a 12-month program to a 10-\n\n 4   month program.” IHO Decision at 26.        The SRO noted that the\n\n 5   IHO “did not cite to any evidentiary basis for her\n\n 6   determination” and concluded that the determination that\n\n 7   “the district’s decision not to offer 12-month services\n\n 8   denied the student a FAPE [was] not supported by the hearing\n\n 9   record.” SRO Decision at 23.    We defer to that conclusion.7\n\n10       The Parents rely exclusively on the IHO’s statement\n\n11   that “the [DOE]’s own witness . . . stated [that] M.W.\n\n12   required a 12-month program” to develop their argument.          See\n\n13   IHO Decision at 26 (citing Tr. at 761) (emphasis added).\n\n14   That reliance is misplaced.    The DOE witness was the special\n\n15   education teacher who would have been leading M.W.’s ICT\n\n16   services and who was not part of the IEP team.        She said\n\n17   that “being a teacher, . . . more is better, and for a child\n\n\n          7\n           The IHO’s misstatements of the record further justify this\n     deference. The IHO credited the “district’s own witness who\n     stated based on her review of the June 10, 2010 IEP [M.W.]\n     required a 12-month program.” IHO Decision at 26. The\n     district’s witness was the special-education teacher who would\n     have ran M.W.’s ICT services. In response to a question whether\n     M.W. would benefit from a 12-month program she merely stated:\n     “Oh, well, being a teacher, I - more is better, and for a child\n     with such deficits, I think a 12 month would be good for this\n     child. Anything to help him, you know.” Tr. 762. She also\n     testified that he would have made progress in a 10-month program.\n     Tr. 770.\n\n                              Page 36 of   37\n\f 1   with such deficits, I think a 12 month [program] would be\n\n 2   good for the child.” Tr. 761 (emphasis added). That\n\n 3   “concession” does not suggest that such a program would be\n\n 4   necessary or required to prevent regression.      Moreover, the\n\n 5   administrative record reveals that regression was not a\n\n 6   topic discussed at the IEP meeting.       See Tr. 638.   Mom\n\n 7   testified that she was not seeking tuition reimbursement for\n\n 8   a 12-month program, only a 10-month program.      Tr. at 1109.\n\n 9   Accordingly, we are not persuaded that the SRO erred in\n\n10   concluding that the absence of 12-month services did not\n\n11   deny M.W. a FAPE. We also do not agree that the cumulative\n\n12   results of the alleged errors resulted in a FAPE denial.\n\n13   See R.E., 694 F.3d at 190.\n\n14       Having considered all of the Parents’ arguments on\n\n15   appeal, we find them to be without merit.      Accordingly, we\n\n16   conclude that the SRO correctly determined that the IEP was\n\n17   substantively adequate and, despite alleged procedural\n\n18   flaws, provided M.W. a FAPE.\n\n19                             Conclusion\n\n20       The district court’s order of June 15, 2012, granting\n\n21   summary judgment for Defendant-Appellee New York City\n\n22   Department of Education is hereby AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                             Page 37 of   37\n\f</pre>",
