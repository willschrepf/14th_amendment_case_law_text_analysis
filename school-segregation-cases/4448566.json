Furnace alleges the Appellees wrongfully classified\nhim as a gang member in retaliation for filing a § 1983 suit\nagainst the defendants’ colleagues. After Furnace filed a\nhabeas petition, California courts rejected his claims on the\nground that there was sufficient evidence to support the gang\nvalidation. Furnace then filed the present action under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of his Fourteenth Amendment\nrights, based on violation of the First Amendment and the\nEqual Protection Clause. The district court dismissed his suit\non claim preclusion grounds. We affirm.\n\f4                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\n        I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n\n    In 2006 Furnace filed a § 1983 suit against eleven Salinas\nValley Prison officials (none of whom is involved in this suit)\nfor allegedly denying him visitation rights and other\nprivileges. These defendants filed a motion to dismiss in\n2008, which was denied. Furnace alleges that shortly after\nthat, R.L. Martinez and M. Valdez, gang investigators at\nSalinas Valley, were “ordered to validate [Furnace] as a\nprison gang member to intimidate and retaliate against him”\nfor filing the earlier suit. The decision to classify Furnace as\na member of the Black Guerilla Family (BGF) was based on\nprison officials finding in Furnace’s cell the contact\ninformation of a validated BGF gang member as well as\nbooks, a CD, and a newspaper article relating to BGF.\n\n    Furnace filed an internal administrative appeal, claiming\nthat the classification lacked evidence, was retaliatory, and\nwas racially motivated. While the appeal was pending, K.\nBerkler, R.S. Marquez, and E.W. Fischer, also gang experts\nat Salinas Valley, again classified Furnace as a gang member.\nHis internal administrative appeals were denied, and he was\nplaced in the prison’s secured housing unit (SHU).\n\n    Furnace then filed a pro se habeas petition in California\nSuperior Court. He named D. Adams (the prison warden),\nR.L. Martinez, Valdez, Berkler, R.S. Marquez, and Fischer as\nrespondents (and others not involved in this appeal). He\nalleged that his gang classification and placement in secured\nhousing lacked sufficient evidence, that it was done to\n“intimidate and retaliate against” Furnace for filing the earlier\nsuit, and that it violated his federal constitutional rights to\nfree speech, equal protection of the law, and due process.\nFurnace sought to be removed from secured housing and to\n\f                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO                        5\n\nhave his record cleared of any allegation that he was gang\naffiliated.\n\n    The Superior Court denied Furnace’s petition on the\nground that there was sufficient evidence to support the gang\nvalidation, without directly addressing whether the\nclassification was retaliatory or racially discriminatory.\nFurnace filed another habeas petition in the California Court\nof Appeal, making the same allegations. The court denied his\npetition, holding, first, that there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport the validation and, second, that the validation did not\nviolate his First Amendment rights. The court denied\nrehearing, and the California Supreme Court summarily\ndenied review.\n\n    In February 2012, Furnace filed this § 1983 suit in federal\ndistrict court. Furnace named as defendants Berkler,\nMarquez, Fischer, R.L. Martinez, and Valdez, plus G.\nGiurbino (collectively, “Appellees”), who allegedly\nsupervised the other Appellees. Furnace’s complaint alleged\nthat his classification was illegal and retaliatory in violation\nof his First Amendment rights, and a violation of his right to\nequal protection and due process under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Furnace asked for declaratory relief, money\ndamages, as well as injunctive relief “to release him from the\nsecurity housing unit” and to “expunge his prison file” of any\nallegation that he is associated with BGF.\n\n     The district court granted the Appellees’ motion to\ndismiss on the ground that Furnace’s suit was barred by claim\npreclusion. The court concluded that “both the state action\nand the instant one arise out of the same incident and involve\nthe same actors allegedly performing the same act of\ninitiating gang validation procedures and ultimately\n\f6                      FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nvalidating [Furnace] as an active gang member without\nproper procedural protections.” Because Furnace sought “to\nvindicate the same primary right in federal court as he [had]\npreviously in state court,” his claim was precluded. Furnace\ntimely appealed. On appeal, Appellees ask us to assess a\nstrike against Furnace under the Prison Litigation Reform Act\nfor having filed a duplicative suit.1\n\n                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n    This appeal raises two main issues. First, Furnace\ncontends that the district court erred in dismissing his First\nAmendment and equal protection claims under California\nclaim preclusion principles. Second, the Appellees ask us to\nassess a “strike” against Furnace under the Prison Litigation\nReform Act. We affirm the district court and decline to\nassess a strike against Furnace.\n\nA. Claim Preclusion\n\n    Under the Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738,\nfederal courts must give the same preclusive effect to state\ncourt judgments, including “reasoned” habeas judgments, as\nthe rendering state court would. Gonzales v. Cal. Dep’t of\nCorr., 739 F.3d 1226, 1230–31 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Migra\nv. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 81\n(1984)). Accordingly, California claim preclusion law\n\n\n\n    1\n       We review de novo a dismissal on res judicata grounds,\nManufactured Home Communities Inc. v. City of San Jose, 420 F.3d 1022,\n1025 (9th Cir. 2005), as well as the district court’s interpretation of the\nPrison Litigation Reform Act, Andrews v. King, 398 F.3d 1113, 1118 (9th\nCir. 2005).\n\f                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO                        7\n\ngoverns whether, in light of his earlier state habeas petition,\nFurnace’s § 1983 claims may be brought in federal court.\n\n     In California, “[c]laim preclusion arises if a second suit\ninvolves: (1) the same cause of action (2) between the same\nparties [or parties in privity with them] (3) after a final\njudgment on the merits in the first suit.” DKN Holdings LLC\nv. Faerber, 352 P.3d 378, 386 (Cal. 2015) (citing Mycogen\nCorp. v. Monsanto Co., 51 P.3d 297, 301 (Cal. 2002)).\nFurnace makes two arguments in response to the Defendants’\nclaim preclusion defense. First, he argues that the “primary\nrights” that were violated here are distinct from the primary\nright he sought to vindicate in his habeas action in California\nstate courts. Second, he argues that the identity of the parties\nis different between the two suits. We address each argument\nin turn.\n\n   1. Primary Rights\n\n    California courts, unlike federal courts, do not determine\nwhether two suits involve the same cause of action by\napplying the “same transaction or occurrence” or “common\nnucleus of operative facts” test. Instead, California courts\nwill hold that two suits involve the same cause of action when\nthey involve the same “primary right.” Brodheim v. Cry,\n584 F.3d 1262, 1268 (9th Cir. 2009). Under this theory “a\n‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of the\nplaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant,\nand a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of\nthat duty.” Mycogen, 51 P.3d at 306. “The most salient\ncharacteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the\nviolation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single\ncause of action.” Id. Thus, in California, “if two actions\ninvolve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong\n\f8                  FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nby the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even\nif in the second suit the plaintiff pleads different theories of\nrecovery, seeks different forms of relief and/or adds new facts\nsupporting recovery.” San Diego Police Officers’ Ass’n v.\nSan Diego City Emps. Ret. Sys., 568 F.3d 725, 734 (9th Cir.\n2009) (quoting Eichman v. Fotomat Corp., 197 Cal. Rptr.\n612, 614 (Ct. App. 1983)). “The critical focus of primary\nrights analysis is the harm suffered.” Brodheim, 584 F.3d at\n1268 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nCalifornia’s primary rights theory can be complicated, and we\nhave cautioned against wielding the “primary right brush . . .\ntoo carelessly” and noted the possibility that “different\nprimary rights may be violated by the same wrongful\nconduct” under certain circumstances. San Diego Police\nOfficers’ Ass’n, 568 F.3d at 734 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But in this case, we have circuit precedent on point\nthat requires us to affirm.\n\n    The facts of Gonzales v. California Department of\nCorrections will sound familiar. There, Gonzales was\nvalidated as a gang member and placed in the SHU. 739 F.3d\nat 1229. After exhausting his administrative remedies, and a\nseries of state habeas proceedings, he filed a § 1983 suit\nalleging that “(1) the gang validation violated his rights to\nfree speech and association under the First Amendment;\n(2) the validation regulations were applied in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner; (3) he was classified as a gang\nmember as retaliation . . . ; [and] (4) his validation . . .\nviolated his due process rights.” Id. The district court\ndismissed the suit on claim preclusion grounds. Id. at 1230.\n\n    On appeal, Gonzales argued “that his retaliation, First\nAmendment, and Equal Protection claims [were] not\nprecluded,” because those claims arose under “a distinct\n\f                    FURNACE V. GIURBINO                        9\n\nprimary right,” from his earlier due process claim. Id. at\n1233 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, he\nargued that his earlier inadequate evidence/due process claim\nwas “procedural” while his First Amendment and Equal\nProtection Clause arguments were “inherently substantive,”\nand he pointed to our decision in Brodheim as having\nrecognized a procedural/substantive divide. Id. We noted\nthat in Brodheim, the two harms—one substantive, one\nprocedural—were distinct because “[t]hey were caused at\ndifferent times, by different acts, and by different actors.” Id.\n(quoting Brodheim, 584 F.3d at 1268–69). By contrast,\nGonzales was “challenging the same actions by the same\ngroup of officials at the same time that resulted in the same\nharm.” Id. at 1234. Accordingly, the procedural/substantive\ndistinction for identifying a distinct primary right was of no\nuse, because whether a party alleges “a different remedy or\nasserts a different legal theory . . . is irrelevant under\nCalifornia claim preclusion doctrine.” Id. Since Gonzales’s\nclaims would be barred in California’s courts under\nCalifornia’s claim preclusion doctrine, they were barred in\nfederal courts under the Full Faith and Credit statute. Id. at\n1230.\n\n    Gonzales requires that we affirm. Furnace challenges\n“the same actions by the same group of officials at the same\ntime that resulted in the same harm.” Id. at 1234. In his state\ncourt action, Furnace raised a due process claim, challenging\nthe evidentiary basis of his gang validation and SHU\nplacement. He also claimed that the validation and SHU\nplacement were retaliatory, racially motivated, and violated\nhis First Amendment rights. And, like the plaintiff in\nGonzales, Furnace attempts to argue that the primary right he\nsought to vindicate in the state proceedings is somehow\ndistinct from the rights he now seeks to vindicate. But, as the\n\f10                    FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court has made clear, a plaintiff’s\nprimary right is the “right to be free from the particular injury\nsuffered” and “must therefore be distinguished from the legal\ntheory on which liability for that injury is premised.”\nMycogen, 51 P.3d at 306–07. At heart, Furnace has always\ncomplained about the same alleged injury: his gang validation\nand SHU placement. He has come up with numerous legal\ntheories as to why it was unlawful—lack of evidence,\nretaliation, and racial discrimination—but it does not change\nthe primary right he seeks to vindicate, and Gonzales makes\nthat point clear. See Gonzales, 739 F.3d at 1233 (the\nplaintiff’s “primary right was his protected liberty interest in\nremaining free from SHU placement” and the “harm\nsuffered” was his “gang validation and indeterminate SHU\ndetention”).2\n\n    Furnace raises two principal arguments in an effort to get\naround our holding in Gonzales. First, he argues that a claim\nchallenging the sufficiency of the gang evidence is\nqualitatively different from a claim that the gang\nclassification was the result of retaliation for the exercise of\n\n     2\n       Furnace claims that in Gonzales we said that the parties’ “dispute\n[was] in defining the primary duty,” Gonzales, 739 F.3d at 1233, and that\nhe is disputing his primary right, not the Appellees’ duty. This argument\nis unavailing. Rights and duties are correlative—they do not exist\nindependent of each other. The possession of a right necessarily implies\nthe existence of a duty; conversely, to say that a party has a duty means\nthat someone is possessed of a right. As California has explained, “a\n‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of the plaintiff, a\ncorresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a wrongful act by the\ndefendant constituting a breach of that duty.” Mycogen, 51 P.3d at 306\n(emphasis added)). Here, as in Gonzales, Furnace’s primary right is the\nright not to be unlawfully determined to be a gang member and placed in\nthe SHU; and it “correspond[s]” to the Appellees’ duty not to unlawfully\nlabel an inmate a gang member and place him in the SHU.\n\f                      FURNACE V. GIURBINO                              11\n\nFirst Amendment rights or was racially motivated in violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause. Second, he argues that he\nmay maintain this suit for damages because he could not have\nobtained damages in his prior habeas action. Furnace’s points\nare technically correct; but, in the context of California’s\nprimary rights doctrine, both are irrelevant.\n\n    First, we recognize that Furnace’s sufficiency-of-the-\nevidence claim, which he raised in his state habeas\nproceedings, and his retaliation and racial discrimination\nclaims, which he raises here, are distinct claims. But they are\nboth part and parcel of the same primary right—Furnace’s\nright not to be wrongfully placed in the SHU. They are\nalternative arguments for accomplishing the same result—his\nrelease from the SHU. The primary rights doctrine under\nCalifornia claim preclusion forecloses Furnace’s ability to file\nseparate suits challenging the same wrong.\n\n     Second, it is also true, but again irrelevant, that Furnace\ncould not have obtained damages through habeas. Habeas, by\nits very nature, is an action to challenge “the fact or length of\ncustody” for which the remedy is release from custody, Wolff\nv. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 554 (1974); it is not an action in\ndamages, Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 494 (1973).\nWe know of no reason, however, that Furnace could not have\nbrought his § 1983 action instead of his state habeas action,\nsee Shoemaker v. Harris, 155 Cal. Rptr. 3d 76, 84 (Ct. App.\n2013), or, even better, joined his habeas and § 1983 actions\nto seek alternative forms of relief,3 Cal. Penal Code\n\n\n\n    3\n       We offer no definitive opinion whether, under California law,\nFurnace could, in fact, have brought both an action in habeas and a § 1983\nlaw in the same suit, nor do we offer any opinion whether Furnace could\n\f12                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\n§ 1473(d) (“[The state habeas statute] shall not be construed\n. . . as precluding the use of any other remedies.”). And\ntherein lies the problem. Having lost his habeas case,\nFurnace has made a new run at the officials through § 1983.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held, and the California courts\nhave agreed, that § 1983 suits cannot be used to collaterally\nattack the validity of a conviction. Thus, “the . . . principle\nthat civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for\nchallenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments\napplies to § 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the\nplaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or\nconfinement.” Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 486 (1994);\nsee also Susag v. City of Lake Forest, 115 Cal. Rptr. 2d 269,\n273 (Ct. App. 2002) (“[The] requirement [that a plaintiff can\npursue relief under § 1983 only after obtaining habeas relief]\navoids a collateral attack on the conviction and relitigation of\nissues of probable cause and guilt, and protects the strong\njudicial policy against inconsistent resolutions.”). The Heck\nprinciple means that “a § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the\nconviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,\nexpunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state\ntribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into\nquestion by a federal court’s issuance of a writ of habeas\ncorpus.” Heck, 512 U.S. at 486–87.\n\n    Heck is not directly on point here, but the principle will\nhelp us focus in this case. Heck prohibits the use of § 1983\nto attack the validity of a conviction, because a recovery in\nthe damages action would necessarily imply that the\nconviction was wrongfully obtained. The judgment of\nconviction and the judgment for damages would be\n\n\nhave decided to forego his habeas action and bring only a § 1983 suit.\nWhat we hold is that he cannot bring them seriatim.\n\f                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO                      13\n\ninconsistent, and there would be no means to reconcile the\ntwo. Like the Heck principle, one reason for California’s\nprimary right doctrine is to avoid piecemeal litigation and the\npossibility of inconsistent judgments. See, e.g., People v.\nBarragan, 83 P.3d 480, 494 (Cal. 2004) (“[T]he purposes of\nthe res judicata doctrine include preventing inconsistent\njudgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial\nsystem . . . .” (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted)). Furnace has already challenged his placement in\nthe SHU in habeas and lost; he cannot now challenge his\nplacement through § 1983 without collaterally attacking—and\nthereby rendering inconsistent—the judgment denying him\nhabeas relief. If he were successful on his § 1983 claim\nagainst the officials who put him in the SHU, it would\nnecessarily be inconsistent with the judgment that he was not\nentitled to habeas relief.\n\n    For example, were he to prevail here, Furnace would be\nentitled to damages for the time he has been wrongfully\nplaced in the SHU and, in fact, he might be entitled to\ndamages on a continuing basis if he were left in the SHU.\nThe Appellees would be in the untenable position that\nCalifornia courts have said he is lawfully housed in the SHU,\nwhile the federal courts would have concluded that he is\nunlawfully housed in the SHU. Following the California\njudgment, the warden might have a duty by virtue of his\noffice to keep him in the SHU, while after the federal\njudgment, the warden (and others) would be personally liable\nfor damages if they keep him there. The two judgments\nwould be irreconcilable. It is of no consequence that § 1983\nis a different remedy from habeas; both are means of\nchallenging the lawfulness of his placement. The primary\nrights doctrine prevents such inconsistent judgments by\nrequiring a party to bring all of his claims—as many causes\n\f14                     FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nof action, or theories of recovery, or remedies as he has—in\na single suit. See Mycogen, 51 P.3d at 302 (“Res judicata\nprecludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of\naction or relitigation of the same cause of action on a\ndifferent legal theory or for different relief.” (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 307 (“The\nprimary right must also be distinguished from the remedy\nsought: The violation of one primary right constitutes a single\ncause of action, though it may entitle the injured party to\nmany forms of relief, and the relief is not to be confounded\nwith the cause of action, one not being determinative of the\nother.” (second emphasis added) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Eichman, 197 Cal. Rptr. at 614 (“[I]f two actions\ninvolve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong\nby the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even\nif in the second suit the plaintiff . . . seeks different forms of\nrelief . . . .” (emphasis added)). The district court correctly\nheld that in these circumstances, Furnace’s “retaliation, First\nAmendment, and Equal Protection claims” involved the same\n“primary right” at issue in the Furnace’s earlier state habeas\nproceeding. Gonzales, 739 F.3d at 1233–34.4\n\n     4\n       We recognize that some California appellate cases lend support to\nFurnace’s claim that the ability to be free from retaliation and/or\ndiscrimination might be a distinct primary right from the substantive\noutcome of an adverse administrative decision, see Agarwal v. Johnson,\n603 P.2d 58, 72 (Cal. 1979) (holding that Title VII claim was distinct\nprimary right from defamation and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress claims under state law); Henderson v. Newport-Mesa Unified Sch.\nDist., 154 Cal. Rptr. 3d 222, 226, 237–40 (Ct. App. 2013) (claim that\nteacher was not properly given “first priority” in hiring under state statute\narose under distinct primary right from discrimination claim); George v.\nCal. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd., 102 Cal. Rptr. 3d 431, 438–41 (Ct.\nApp. 2009) (ALJ’s retaliation claim arose under distinct primary right\nfrom wrongful suspension claim), and that some cases might suggest that\nthe availability of differing remedies would counsel against the application\n\f                      FURNACE V. GIURBINO                            15\n\n    We hold that the same primary right—Furnace’s right to\nbe free from unlawful gang validation and placement in the\nSHU—was at issue in both suits.\n\n    2. Identity of Parties\n\n     As we suggested above, Furnace’s suit involves\n“challenging the same actions by the same group of officials\nat the same time that resulted in the same harm.” Id. at 1234\n(emphasis added). Furnace asserts that the defendants in this\nsuit are different from the defendants in his state habeas suit.\nAnd Appellees counter that California claim preclusion only\nrequires identity of the party against whom preclusion is\nsought. Neither party is entirely correct on these points,\nthough we ultimately conclude that the requisite identity of\nparties is met.\n\n    Appellees rely solely on California issue preclusion case\nlaw to sustain the proposition that only the party against\nwhom preclusion is sought need be the same in both suits.\nSee, e.g., Lucido v. Superior Court, 795 P.2d 1223, 1225 (Cal.\n1990). California’s claim preclusion case law—which has\ndistinct requirements—prevents relitigation “between the\nsame parties or parties in privity with them.” DKN Holdings,\n352 P.3d at 386 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). That said, we cannot agree with Furnace that “the\ndefendants in this action were not defendants in Furnace’s\n\n\nof claim preclusion, see Shoemaker v. Harris, 155 Cal. Rptr. 3d 76, 84 &\nn.13; Branson v. Sun-Diamond Growers of Cal., 29 Cal. Rptr. 2d 314, 323\n(Ct. App. 1994); Roberts v. Redlich, 244 P.2d 933, 935 (Cal. Dist. Ct.\nApp. 1952). These decisions all arose in very different contexts, predate\nour decision in Gonzales, and do not, in any event, shake our confidence\nthat Gonzales was rightly decided.\n\f16                    FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nstate habeas proceeding.” At the time of his state habeas\npetition, he named the then-warden, D. Adams, “et al.” as\nrespondents. He made numerous references to “prison\nofficials” throughout the petition, and most importantly, he\nspecifically named “R.L. Martinez,” “M. Valdez,” “Keri\nBerkler,” “R.S. Marquez,” and “Everett W. Fischer” as\nrespondents.5\n\n     Accordingly, because Furnace’s suit involves “(1) the\nsame cause of action (2) between the same parties [or parties\nin privity with them] (3) after a final judgment on the merits\nin the first suit,” we affirm.6 DKN Holdings, 352 P.3d at 386.\n\nB. PLRA Strike\n\n   The Appellees ask us to assess a strike against Furnace\nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 28 U.S.C.\n\n\n     5\n       The only current defendant not named was Giurbino, a party who\nwas nonetheless in privity with the other officials due to his supervisory\nrelationship in the prison system. DKN Holdings, 352 P.3d at 389 (noting\nthat privity is found where “separate defendants’ interests” are “closely\nalign[ed]” like “between a corporation and its employees, a general\ncontractor and subcontractors, an association of securities dealers and\nmember agents, and among alleged coconspirators” (emphasis added)\n(citations omitted)).\n     6\n       Alternatively, the Appellees argue that Furnace failed to state a\nretaliation claim because his placement in the SHU was supported under\nthe “some evidence” standard. See Superintendent v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445,\n455 (1985). Because we affirm the district court on claim preclusion\ngrounds, we decline to address the Appellees’ argument, as well as\nFurnace’s response, that a retaliation claim can survive a motion to\ndismiss in the face of “some evidence” supporting a SHU placement. See\nBruce v. Ylst, 351 F.3d 1283, 1289 (9th Cir. 2003); Hines v. Gomez,\n108 F.3d 265, 269 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\f                      FURNACE V. GIURBINO                           17\n\n§ 1915(g). Under § 1915(g), a prisoner can lose the ability to\nfile suits in forma pauperis (IFP) if he “has, on 3 or more\nprior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility,\nbrought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that\nwas dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious,\nor fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.”\nAppellees assert that since this suit “duplicates claims\nbrought in an earlier action” it is “malicious” within the\nmeaning of the PLRA. See Pittman v. Moore, 980 F.2d 994\n(5th Cir. 1993). The Appellees therefore want us to deem the\ndistrict court’s dismissal as Furnace’s first “strike.”\n\n    The question of whether Furnace’s dismissal in this case\nwas frivolous, malicious, or dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim is not germane at this point. Generally, “district courts\ndo not issue these strikes one by one, in their orders of\njudgment,” because nothing in the PLRA requires them to do\nso. Andrews v. King, 398 F.3d 1113, 1119 n.8 (9th Cir. 2005)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). And by extension,\nnothing in the PLRA requires us to do so at this time.\nTypically it is not until a defendant “challenge[s] a prisoner-\nplaintiff’s IFP status,” id. at 1120, that a backwards-looking\ninquiry is done to assess whether “on 3 or more occasions,”\nthe prisoner-plaintiff’s suit was “dismissed on the grounds\nthat it [wa]s frivolous, malicious, or fail[ed] to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted,” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).\nAccordingly, we decline the Appellees’ request to assess a\nstrike.7\n\n\n    7\n      We do note our skepticism, however, of labeling Furnace’s suit\n“malicious” merely because of its repetitiveness. The fact that Furnace\nhad a good faith argument that his claims were not barred by California\nclaim preclusion weighs against finding Furnace’s suit “malicious” or\n“frivolous.”\n\f18               FURNACE V.

The\npanel concluded that the same primary right – the prisoner’s\nright to be free from unlawful gang validation and placement\nin the segregated housing unit – was at issue in both suits.\nThe panel also rejected the prisoner’s argument that the\nidentity of the parties was different between this § 1983\naction and his prior habeas action.\n\n\n\n\n    *\n      This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court.

Furnace alleges the Appellees wrongfully classified\nhim as a gang member in retaliation for filing a § 1983 suit\nagainst the defendants’ colleagues. After Furnace filed a\nhabeas petition, California courts rejected his claims on the\nground that there was sufficient evidence to support the gang\nvalidation. Furnace then filed the present action under\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of his Fourteenth Amendment\nrights, based on violation of the First Amendment and the\nEqual Protection Clause. The district court dismissed his suit\non claim preclusion grounds. We affirm.\n\f4                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\n        I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW\n\n    In 2006 Furnace filed a § 1983 suit against eleven Salinas\nValley Prison officials (none of whom is involved in this suit)\nfor allegedly denying him visitation rights and other\nprivileges. These defendants filed a motion to dismiss in\n2008, which was denied. Furnace alleges that shortly after\nthat, R.L. Martinez and M. Valdez, gang investigators at\nSalinas Valley, were “ordered to validate [Furnace] as a\nprison gang member to intimidate and retaliate against him”\nfor filing the earlier suit. The decision to classify Furnace as\na member of the Black Guerilla Family (BGF) was based on\nprison officials finding in Furnace’s cell the contact\ninformation of a validated BGF gang member as well as\nbooks, a CD, and a newspaper article relating to BGF.\n\n    Furnace filed an internal administrative appeal, claiming\nthat the classification lacked evidence, was retaliatory, and\nwas racially motivated. While the appeal was pending, K.\nBerkler, R.S. Marquez, and E.W. Fischer, also gang experts\nat Salinas Valley, again classified Furnace as a gang member.\nHis internal administrative appeals were denied, and he was\nplaced in the prison’s secured housing unit (SHU).\n\n    Furnace then filed a pro se habeas petition in California\nSuperior Court. He named D. Adams (the prison warden),\nR.L. Martinez, Valdez, Berkler, R.S. Marquez, and Fischer as\nrespondents (and others not involved in this appeal). He\nalleged that his gang classification and placement in secured\nhousing lacked sufficient evidence, that it was done to\n“intimidate and retaliate against” Furnace for filing the earlier\nsuit, and that it violated his federal constitutional rights to\nfree speech, equal protection of the law, and due process.\nFurnace sought to be removed from secured housing and to\n\f                   FURNACE V. GIURBINO                        5\n\nhave his record cleared of any allegation that he was gang\naffiliated.\n\n    The Superior Court denied Furnace’s petition on the\nground that there was sufficient evidence to support the gang\nvalidation, without directly addressing whether the\nclassification was retaliatory or racially discriminatory.\nFurnace filed another habeas petition in the California Court\nof Appeal, making the same allegations. The court denied his\npetition, holding, first, that there was sufficient evidence to\nsupport the validation and, second, that the validation did not\nviolate his First Amendment rights. The court denied\nrehearing, and the California Supreme Court summarily\ndenied review.\n\n    In February 2012, Furnace filed this § 1983 suit in federal\ndistrict court. Furnace named as defendants Berkler,\nMarquez, Fischer, R.L. Martinez, and Valdez, plus G.\nGiurbino (collectively, “Appellees”), who allegedly\nsupervised the other Appellees. Furnace’s complaint alleged\nthat his classification was illegal and retaliatory in violation\nof his First Amendment rights, and a violation of his right to\nequal protection and due process under the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Furnace asked for declaratory relief, money\ndamages, as well as injunctive relief “to release him from the\nsecurity housing unit” and to “expunge his prison file” of any\nallegation that he is associated with BGF.\n\n     The district court granted the Appellees’ motion to\ndismiss on the ground that Furnace’s suit was barred by claim\npreclusion. The court concluded that “both the state action\nand the instant one arise out of the same incident and involve\nthe same actors allegedly performing the same act of\ninitiating gang validation procedures and ultimately\n\f6                      FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nvalidating [Furnace] as an active gang member without\nproper procedural protections.” Because Furnace sought “to\nvindicate the same primary right in federal court as he [had]\npreviously in state court,” his claim was precluded. Furnace\ntimely appealed. On appeal, Appellees ask us to assess a\nstrike against Furnace under the Prison Litigation Reform Act\nfor having filed a duplicative suit.1\n\n                           II. ANALYSIS\n\n    This appeal raises two main issues. First, Furnace\ncontends that the district court erred in dismissing his First\nAmendment and equal protection claims under California\nclaim preclusion principles. Second, the Appellees ask us to\nassess a “strike” against Furnace under the Prison Litigation\nReform Act. We affirm the district court and decline to\nassess a strike against Furnace.\n\nA. Claim Preclusion\n\n    Under the Full Faith and Credit Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1738,\nfederal courts must give the same preclusive effect to state\ncourt judgments, including “reasoned” habeas judgments, as\nthe rendering state court would.

Second, he argues that the identity of the parties\nis different between the two suits. We address each argument\nin turn.\n\n   1. Primary Rights\n\n    California courts, unlike federal courts, do not determine\nwhether two suits involve the same cause of action by\napplying the “same transaction or occurrence” or “common\nnucleus of operative facts” test. Instead, California courts\nwill hold that two suits involve the same cause of action when\nthey involve the same “primary right.” Brodheim v. Cry,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435290\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435290/brodheim-v-cry/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1268 (9th Cir. 2009). Under this theory “a\n‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of the\nplaintiff, a corresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant,\nand a wrongful act by the defendant constituting a breach of\nthat duty.” Mycogen, 51 P.3d at 306. “The most salient\ncharacteristic of a primary right is that it is indivisible: the\nviolation of a single primary right gives rise to but a single\ncause of action.” Id. Thus, in California, “if two actions\ninvolve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong\n\f8                  FURNACE V.

App. 1983)). “The critical focus of primary\nrights analysis is the harm suffered.” Brodheim, 584 F.3d at\n1268 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nCalifornia’s primary rights theory can be complicated, and we\nhave cautioned against wielding the “primary right brush . . .\ntoo carelessly” and noted the possibility that “different\nprimary rights may be violated by the same wrongful\nconduct” under certain circumstances. San Diego Police\nOfficers’ Ass’n, 568 F.3d at 734 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). But in this case, we have circuit precedent on point\nthat requires us to affirm.\n\n    The facts of Gonzales v. California Department of\nCorrections will sound familiar. There, Gonzales was\nvalidated as a gang member and placed in the SHU. 739 F.3d\nat 1229. After exhausting his administrative remedies, and a\nseries of state habeas proceedings, he filed a § 1983 suit\nalleging that “(1) the gang validation violated his rights to\nfree speech and association under the First Amendment;\n(2) the validation regulations were applied in a racially\ndiscriminatory manner; (3) he was classified as a gang\nmember as retaliation . . . ; [and] (4) his validation . . .\nviolated his due process rights.” Id. The district court\ndismissed the suit on claim preclusion grounds. Id. at 1230.\n\n    On appeal, Gonzales argued “that his retaliation, First\nAmendment, and Equal Protection claims [were] not\nprecluded,” because those claims arose under “a distinct\n\f                    FURNACE V. GIURBINO                        9\n\nprimary right,” from his earlier due process claim. Id. at\n1233 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, he\nargued that his earlier inadequate evidence/due process claim\nwas “procedural” while his First Amendment and Equal\nProtection Clause arguments were “inherently substantive,”\nand he pointed to our decision in Brodheim as having\nrecognized a procedural/substantive divide. Id. We noted\nthat in Brodheim, the two harms—one substantive, one\nprocedural—were distinct because “[t]hey were caused at\ndifferent times, by different acts, and by different actors.” Id.\n(quoting Brodheim, 584 F.3d at 1268–69). By contrast,\nGonzales was “challenging the same actions by the same\ngroup of officials at the same time that resulted in the same\nharm.” Id. at 1234. Accordingly, the procedural/substantive\ndistinction for identifying a distinct primary right was of no\nuse, because whether a party alleges “a different remedy or\nasserts a different legal theory . . . is irrelevant under\nCalifornia claim preclusion doctrine.” Id. Since Gonzales’s\nclaims would be barred in California’s courts under\nCalifornia’s claim preclusion doctrine, they were barred in\nfederal courts under the Full Faith and Credit statute. Id. at\n1230.\n\n    Gonzales requires that we affirm. Furnace challenges\n“the same actions by the same group of officials at the same\ntime that resulted in the same harm.” Id. at 1234. In his state\ncourt action, Furnace raised a due process claim, challenging\nthe evidentiary basis of his gang validation and SHU\nplacement. He also claimed that the validation and SHU\nplacement were retaliatory, racially motivated, and violated\nhis First Amendment rights. And, like the plaintiff in\nGonzales, Furnace attempts to argue that the primary right he\nsought to vindicate in the state proceedings is somehow\ndistinct from the rights he now seeks to vindicate. But, as the\n\f10                    FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court has made clear, a plaintiff’s\nprimary right is the “right to be free from the particular injury\nsuffered” and “must therefore be distinguished from the legal\ntheory on which liability for that injury is premised.”\nMycogen, 51 P.3d at 306–07. At heart, Furnace has always\ncomplained about the same alleged injury: his gang validation\nand SHU placement. He has come up with numerous legal\ntheories as to why it was unlawful—lack of evidence,\nretaliation, and racial discrimination—but it does not change\nthe primary right he seeks to vindicate, and Gonzales makes\nthat point clear. See Gonzales, 739 F.3d at 1233 (the\nplaintiff’s “primary right was his protected liberty interest in\nremaining free from SHU placement” and the “harm\nsuffered” was his “gang validation and indeterminate SHU\ndetention”).2\n\n    Furnace raises two principal arguments in an effort to get\naround our holding in Gonzales. First, he argues that a claim\nchallenging the sufficiency of the gang evidence is\nqualitatively different from a claim that the gang\nclassification was the result of retaliation for the exercise of\n\n     2\n       Furnace claims that in Gonzales we said that the parties’ “dispute\n[was] in defining the primary duty,” Gonzales, 739 F.3d at 1233, and that\nhe is disputing his primary right, not the Appellees’ duty. This argument\nis unavailing. Rights and duties are correlative—they do not exist\nindependent of each other. The possession of a right necessarily implies\nthe existence of a duty; conversely, to say that a party has a duty means\nthat someone is possessed of a right. As California has explained, “a\n‘cause of action’ is comprised of a ‘primary right’ of the plaintiff, a\ncorresponding ‘primary duty’ of the defendant, and a wrongful act by the\ndefendant constituting a breach of that duty.” Mycogen, 51 P.3d at 306\n(emphasis added)). Here, as in Gonzales, Furnace’s primary right is the\nright not to be unlawfully determined to be a gang member and placed in\nthe SHU; and it “correspond[s]” to the Appellees’ duty not to unlawfully\nlabel an inmate a gang member and place him in the SHU.\n\f                      FURNACE V. GIURBINO                              11\n\nFirst Amendment rights or was racially motivated in violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause. Second, he argues that he\nmay maintain this suit for damages because he could not have\nobtained damages in his prior habeas action. Furnace’s points\nare technically correct; but, in the context of California’s\nprimary rights doctrine, both are irrelevant.\n\n    First, we recognize that Furnace’s sufficiency-of-the-\nevidence claim, which he raised in his state habeas\nproceedings, and his retaliation and racial discrimination\nclaims, which he raises here, are distinct claims. But they are\nboth part and parcel of the same primary right—Furnace’s\nright not to be wrongfully placed in the SHU. They are\nalternative arguments for accomplishing the same result—his\nrelease from the SHU. The primary rights doctrine under\nCalifornia claim preclusion forecloses Furnace’s ability to file\nseparate suits challenging the same wrong.\n\n     Second, it is also true, but again irrelevant, that Furnace\ncould not have obtained damages through habeas.

GIURBINO\n\n§ 1473(d) (“[The state habeas statute] shall not be construed\n. . . as precluding the use of any other remedies.”). And\ntherein lies the problem. Having lost his habeas case,\nFurnace has made a new run at the officials through § 1983.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held, and the California courts\nhave agreed, that § 1983 suits cannot be used to collaterally\nattack the validity of a conviction. Thus, “the . . . principle\nthat civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for\nchallenging the validity of outstanding criminal judgments\napplies to § 1983 damages actions that necessarily require the\nplaintiff to prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or\nconfinement.” Heck v.

App. 2002) (“[The] requirement [that a plaintiff can\npursue relief under § 1983 only after obtaining habeas relief]\navoids a collateral attack on the conviction and relitigation of\nissues of probable cause and guilt, and protects the strong\njudicial policy against inconsistent resolutions.”). The Heck\nprinciple means that “a § 1983 plaintiff must prove that the\nconviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,\nexpunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state\ntribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into\nquestion by a federal court’s issuance of a writ of habeas\ncorpus.” Heck, 512 U.S. at 486–87.\n\n    Heck is not directly on point here, but the principle will\nhelp us focus in this case. Heck prohibits the use of § 1983\nto attack the validity of a conviction, because a recovery in\nthe damages action would necessarily imply that the\nconviction was wrongfully obtained.

GIURBINO                      13\n\ninconsistent, and there would be no means to reconcile the\ntwo. Like the Heck principle, one reason for California’s\nprimary right doctrine is to avoid piecemeal litigation and the\npossibility of inconsistent judgments. See, e.g., People v.\nBarragan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629193\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629193/people-v-barragan/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494 (Cal. 2004) (“[T]he purposes of\nthe res judicata doctrine include preventing inconsistent\njudgments which undermine the integrity of the judicial\nsystem . . . .” (internal quotation marks and alterations\nomitted)). Furnace has already challenged his placement in\nthe SHU in habeas and lost; he cannot now challenge his\nplacement through § 1983 without collaterally attacking—and\nthereby rendering inconsistent—the judgment denying him\nhabeas relief. If he were successful on his § 1983 claim\nagainst the officials who put him in the SHU, it would\nnecessarily be inconsistent with the judgment that he was not\nentitled to habeas relief.\n\n    For example, were he to prevail here, Furnace would be\nentitled to damages for the time he has been wrongfully\nplaced in the SHU and, in fact, he might be entitled to\ndamages on a continuing basis if he were left in the SHU.\nThe Appellees would be in the untenable position that\nCalifornia courts have said he is lawfully housed in the SHU,\nwhile the federal courts would have concluded that he is\nunlawfully housed in the SHU. Following the California\njudgment, the warden might have a duty by virtue of his\noffice to keep him in the SHU, while after the federal\njudgment, the warden (and others) would be personally liable\nfor damages if they keep him there. The two judgments\nwould be irreconcilable. It is of no consequence that § 1983\nis a different remedy from habeas; both are means of\nchallenging the lawfulness of his placement. The primary\nrights doctrine prevents such inconsistent judgments by\nrequiring a party to bring all of his claims—as many causes\n\f14                     FURNACE V. GIURBINO\n\nof action, or theories of recovery, or remedies as he has—in\na single suit. See Mycogen, 51 P.3d at 302 (“Res judicata\nprecludes piecemeal litigation by splitting a single cause of\naction or relitigation of the same cause of action on a\ndifferent legal theory or for different relief.” (emphasis\nadded) (internal quotation marks omitted)); id. at 307 (“The\nprimary right must also be distinguished from the remedy\nsought: The violation of one primary right constitutes a single\ncause of action, though it may entitle the injured party to\nmany forms of relief, and the relief is not to be confounded\nwith the cause of action, one not being determinative of the\nother.” (second emphasis added) (internal quotation marks\nomitted)); Eichman, 197 Cal. Rptr. at 614 (“[I]f two actions\ninvolve the same injury to the plaintiff and the same wrong\nby the defendant then the same primary right is at stake even\nif in the second suit the plaintiff . . . seeks different forms of\nrelief . . . .” (emphasis added)). The district court correctly\nheld that in these circumstances, Furnace’s “retaliation, First\nAmendment, and Equal Protection claims” involved the same\n“primary right” at issue in the Furnace’s earlier state habeas\nproceeding. Gonzales, 739 F.3d at 1233–34.4\n\n     4\n       We recognize that some California appellate cases lend support to\nFurnace’s claim that the ability to be free from retaliation and/or\ndiscrimination might be a distinct primary right from the substantive\noutcome of an adverse administrative decision, see Agarwal v.

Identity of Parties\n\n     As we suggested above, Furnace’s suit involves\n“challenging the same actions by the same group of officials\nat the same time that resulted in the same harm.” Id. at 1234\n(emphasis added). Furnace asserts that the defendants in this\nsuit are different from the defendants in his state habeas suit.\nAnd Appellees counter that California claim preclusion only\nrequires identity of the party against whom preclusion is\nsought. Neither party is entirely correct on these points,\nthough we ultimately conclude that the requisite identity of\nparties is met.\n\n    Appellees rely solely on California issue preclusion case\nlaw to sustain the proposition that only the party against\nwhom preclusion is sought need be the same in both suits.\nSee, e.g., Lucido v.

Because we affirm the district court on claim preclusion\ngrounds, we decline to address the Appellees’ argument, as well as\nFurnace’s response, that a retaliation claim can survive a motion to\ndismiss in the face of “some evidence” supporting a SHU placement.

Under § 1915(g), a prisoner can lose the ability to\nfile suits in forma pauperis (IFP) if he “has, on 3 or more\nprior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility,\nbrought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that\nwas dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious,\nor fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.”\nAppellees assert that since this suit “duplicates claims\nbrought in an earlier action” it is “malicious” within the\nmeaning of the PLRA. See Pittman v. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596132\"><a href=\"/opinion/596132/wesley-lynn-pittman-v-k-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(5th Cir. 1993). The Appellees therefore want us to deem the\ndistrict court’s dismissal as Furnace’s first “strike.”\n\n    The question of whether Furnace’s dismissal in this case\nwas frivolous, malicious, or dismissed for failure to state a\nclaim is not germane at this point. Generally, “district courts\ndo not issue these strikes one by one, in their orders of\njudgment,” because nothing in the PLRA requires them to do\nso. Andrews v.

And by extension,\nnothing in the PLRA requires us to do so at this time.\nTypically it is not until a defendant “challenge[s] a prisoner-\nplaintiff’s IFP status,” id. at 1120, that a backwards-looking\ninquiry is done to assess whether “on 3 or more occasions,”\nthe prisoner-plaintiff’s suit was “dismissed on the grounds\nthat it [wa]s frivolous, malicious, or fail[ed] to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted,” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(g).\nAccordingly, we decline the Appellees’ request to assess a\nstrike.7\n\n\n    7\n      We do note our skepticism, however, of labeling Furnace’s suit\n“malicious” merely because of its repetitiveness. The fact that Furnace\nhad a good faith argument that his claims were not barred by California\nclaim preclusion weighs against finding Furnace’s suit “malicious” or\n“frivolous.”\n\f18               FURNACE V.
