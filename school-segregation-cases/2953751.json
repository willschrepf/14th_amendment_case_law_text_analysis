By five issues, Garcia argues that: (1) the City failed to state valid grounds\n\nfor summary judgment where its motion expressly relies only on “Rule 166b, 166i Texas\n\fRules of Civil Procedure,” see generally TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a; (2) the City was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment under Texas Local Government Code section 272.001\n\nbecause it failed to identify a specific statutory violation and failed to present evidence\n\nregarding any alleged violation, see TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 272.001 (West Supp.\n\n2011) (requiring public notice regarding the sale or exchange of land by a political\n\nsubdivision); (3) the City failed to assert or prove noncompliance with Texas Local\n\nGovernment Code section 253.008, see id. § 253.008 (West 2005) (establishing\n\nrequirements for the sale of real property by a municipality by public auction); (4) the\n\nCity was not entitled to summary judgment under the Texas Constitution because it did\n\nnot acknowledge or address the “public purpose” test for analyzing whether a\n\ntransaction is improper and there was evidence the transaction met that test, see TEX.\n\nCONST., art. XI, § 3 (prohibiting a municipal corporation from becoming “a subscriber to\n\nthe capital of any private corporation or association,” making “any appropriation or\n\ndonation to the same, or in anywise [lending] its credit”); and (5) the City was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment on “public policy” grounds when there was no evidence of\n\nviolation of any state statute or public policy grounds.1 We reverse and remand.\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The City filed a three-page petition for declaratory judgment which alleged that\n\nthe City entered into an agreement to transfer real property to Garcia pursuant to City of\n\nElsa Resolution No. 01-07; that it extended credit to Garcia pursuant to a promissory\n\nnote which was contrary to the laws of the State of Texas; and that Garcia defaulted on\n\nthe promissory note. The City’s pleading did not give any other background facts, did\n\n       1\n         At oral argument, Garcia waived and abandoned his fourth issue, that any statutory violation\nwas cured by the validation statute. As such, we will not address Garcia’s fourth issue.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fnot provide any specific statutory or other legal basis for invalidating the transaction,\n\nand did not further identify either the real property or the loan agreement. The City’s\n\npleading for declaratory relief asked that the trial court declare the contract between the\n\nparties to be invalid. The relevant paragraph of the petition states, in its entirety:\n\n        City incorporates the factual allegations as set forth above. In accordance\n        with the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 31.001 et. seq., City\n        requests that this Court declare the rights, duties, obligations of the parties\n        involved in the real estate transaction between City and Defendant\n        [Garcia], specifically the agreement attached as Exhibit A.\n\nNo “Exhibit A” or any other document was attached to the City’s petition. In response,\n\nGarcia filed a general denial.\n\n        The City moved for summary judgment on grounds that the contract between the\n\nCity and Garcia is void because it is an illegal contract and is against public policy.\n\nSpecifically, the City alleged that the contract was illegal because, inter alia, it sold its\n\nproperty to Garcia without complying with the public auction and sealed bid\n\nrequirements of Texas Local Government Code section 253.0082 and without meeting\n\nthe notice and publication requirements of Texas Local Government Code section\n\n272.001.3 See TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 253.008, 272.001. The City also alleged\n\nin its motion that the agreement is unconstitutional under article XI, sections 3, 5, and 7\n\nof the Texas Constitution, and quoted section 3. See TEX. CONST. art. XI, §§ 3, 5, 7. In\n\nthis regard, the City’s argument, in its entirety, is as follows:\n\n        2\n           Texas Local Government Code section 253.008 provides: “The government body of a\nmunicipality may sell real property owned by the municipality by public auction or by sealed bid under\nSection 272.001.” TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 253.008 (West 2005).\n\n        3\n          Texas Local Government Code section 272.001 provides that before land owned by a political\nsubdivision of the state may be sold, notice to the general public of the offer of the land for sale or\nexchange must be published in a newspaper of general circulation on two separate dates, and the sale\nmay not occur until after the 14th day after the date of the second publication. See id.. § 272.001 (West\nSupp. 2011).\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f       [Garcia] is not obligated to pay anything, including interest, for five years,\n       and nothing was done by [the] City to make sure that [Garcia] did not\n       transfer the property of [sic] do the economic development that [Garcia]\n       had to do. The purported agreement at issue is illegal as far as Texas\n       Constitution, Texas Statute, City Charter, and against public policy.\n       Plaintiff[4] cannot present any evidence at trial [that] legalized the\n       agreement. Further, the purported agreement is illegal or against public\n       policy as it defeats the purpose of the City of Elsa coffers which is to\n       benefit all citizens of the City, not a specific individual. Therefore, the\n       purported agreement is illegal and against public policy and should be\n       declared void by this Honorable Court.\n\nNo affidavit, deposition or other testimonial evidence is attached to the City’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment which would support the background facts included in its motion. A\n\ncopy of a document entitled “Resolution No. 01-07” is attached as exhibit A, and a copy\n\nof a document entitled “Promissory Note” is attached as exhibit B. The City did not\n\nauthenticate either document, or support them by affidavit, and the City did not provide\n\nany evidentiary support for any fact alleged in its motion for summary judgment. Exhibit\n\nA to the motion for summary judgment is a resolution passed by the City authorizing the\n\nconveyance of the described property. Exhibit B is a promissory note between the City,\n\nas lender, and Garcia, as borrower. The property referenced in the resolution is the\n\nsame property that is identified as the security for payment of the promissory note.\n\n       Garcia filed a response to the City’s motion for summary judgment.                                In his\n\nresponse, Garcia discussed the background facts surrounding the transaction and\n\ngenerally rebutted the City’s arguments. In support of his response, he submitted nine\n\nexhibits which were authenticated by affidavit.5 However, Garcia did not include any\n\nevidence which would support the facts alleged in his response.\n\n\n       4\n           The City is the “plaintiff” in this lawsuit; thus, the reference must be to Garcia, as defendant.\n       5\n         The exhibits include: “Resolution No. 01-07” dated February 20, 2001; “Promissory Note” dated\nMarch 2, 2001; “Warranty Deed with Vendor’s Lien” dated March 2, 2001; “Warranty Deed with Vendor’s\n\n                                                        4\n\f        The trial court granted the City’s motion for summary judgment. It ordered that\n\n“the promissory note between the City of Elsa and Roy Garcia attached as Exhibit A to\n\nthis Order is void and that the title to the property therein described revert back to the\n\nCity of Elsa.” The trial court further ordered that “the City of Elsa reimburse Roy Garcia\n\nthe sum of $2,866.98 for payments he made to the City under the void promissory\n\nnote.” This appeal ensued.\n\n                                       II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The purpose of a declaratory action is to establish the existing rights, status or\n\nother legal relationships between parties. City of El Paso v. Heinrich, 284 S.W.3d 366,\n\n370 (Tex. 2009); see TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.002(b) (West 2008). A\n\ndeclaratory judgment is appropriate only when there is a justiciable controversy about\n\nthe rights and status of the parties and the declaration would resolve the controversy.\n\nBonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995). Declaratory relief is\n\nnot warranted unless the claim presents a “substantial controversy” of “immediacy and\n\nreality.” Tex. A & M Univ.-Kingsville v. Yarbrough, 347 S.W.3d 289, 291 (Tex. 2011)\n\n(quoting Md. Cas. Co. v. Pac. Coal & Oil Co., 312 U.S. 270, 273 (1941)). Suits for\n\ndeclaratory judgment are intended to determine the rights of parties when a controversy\n\nhas arisen, but before any wrong has been committed. See Armstrong v. Hixon, 206\n\nS.W.3d 175, 179 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2006, pet. denied); Montemayor v. City of\n\n\n\n\nLien (Correction Deed)” dated March 14, 2003; “Plaintiff’s Original Petition” in a matter styled The City of\nElsa v. Roy Garcia, Jr., Cause No. CL-04-609-B, County Court at Law No. 2 of Hidalgo County, Texas,\nwith a file stamped date of March 15, 2004; an “Order of Dismissal” regarding this lawsuit, with a file\nstamped date of April 7, 2009; Texas Commission of Environmental Quality letter to Roy Garcia dated\nAugust 19, 2006; Gustavo L. Acevedo, Jr. letter to Roy Garcia dated July 22, 2009; and miscellaneous\nreceipts and checks.\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fSan Antonio Fire Dep’t, 985 S.W.2d 549, 551 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1998, pet.\n\ndenied).\n\n       Declaratory judgments are reviewed under the same standards as other\n\njudgments and decrees. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.010 (West 2008);\n\nHawkins v. El Paso First Health Plans, Inc., 214 S.W.3d 709, 719 (Tex. App.—Austin\n\n2007, pet. denied). We look to the procedure used to resolve the issue at trial to\n\ndetermine the standard of review on appeal. See Armstrong, 206 S.W.3d at 179; City of\n\nAustin v. Garza, 124 S.W.3d 867, 871 (Tex. App.—Austin 2003, no pet.). Inasmuch as\n\nthe trial court determined the declaratory judgment through summary judgment\n\nproceedings, we review the propriety of the trial court’s declarations under the same\n\nstandards we apply to summary judgments. See City of Austin, 124 S.W.3d at 719;\n\nLidawi v. Progressive County Mut. Ins. Co., 112 S.W.3d 725, 730 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2003, no pet.).\n\n       The function of a summary judgment is to eliminate patently unmeritorious claims\n\nand untenable defenses, not to deprive litigants of the right to a trial by jury. Tex. Dep’t\n\nof Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004); Alaniz v. Hoyt, 105\n\nS.W.3d 330, 345 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2003, no pet.). This court applies de novo\n\nreview to a summary judgment order using the same summary judgment standard\n\nemployed in the first instance by the trial court. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164\n\nS.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005); Creditwatch, Inc. v. Jackson, 157 S.W.3d 814, 816 n.7\n\n(Tex. 2005) (citing Schneider Nat’l Carriers, Inc. v. Bates, 147 S.W.3d 264, 290 n.137\n\n(Tex. 2004)); Armstrong v. Armstrong, 206 S.W.3d 175, 180 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n2006, pet. denied).     If the trial court’s order granting summary judgment does not\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fspecify the ground or grounds relied upon for the ruling, we will affirm the judgment on\n\nappeal if any of the theories advanced by the movant are meritorious. Dow Chem. Co.\n\nv. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001) (quoting Carr v. Brasher, 776 S.W.2d 567,\n\n569 (Tex. 1989)).\n\n           III. TRADITIONAL OR NO-EVIDENCE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       In his first issue, Garcia argues that the City did not state valid grounds for\n\nsummary judgment when it (1) expressly relied only on “rule “166b, 166i Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure,” although no such rules exist; (2) rule 166a(b) concerns summary\n\njudgment for a defendant and the City was the plaintiff; and (3) the City did not state any\n\nelements for which Garcia had the burden of proof and for which he had no evidence,\n\nthereby failing to comply with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to no-\n\nevidence motions for summary judgment.\n\n       The City’s motion for summary judgment incorrectly refers to “166b, 166i Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure.”     Therefore, as a threshold matter, we must determine\n\nwhether the City’s motion for summary judgment is in substance a traditional or no-\n\nevidence motion so that we may apply the appropriate standard of review. See Tex.\n\nIntegrated Conveyor Sys., Inc. v. Innovative Conveyor Concepts, Inc., 300 S.W.3d 348,\n\n375 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009, pet. denied); Rodgers v. Weatherspoon, 141 S.W.3d 342,\n\n344 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2004, no pet.). In determining whether a motion for summary\n\njudgment is brought on traditional grounds or no-evidence grounds, we consider the\n\nsubstance of the motion rather than categorizing the motion strictly by its form or title.\n\nTex. Integrated Conveyor Sys., Inc., 300 S.W.3d at 375; Rodgers, 141 S.W.3d at 344.\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\f       In its motion for summary judgment, the City contends that it is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment because there is “no genuine issue of material fact.” It argues that\n\nthe contract was illegal, contrary to public policy, and “unconstitutional and without\n\nauthority.” The City asserts that “there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard\n\nto illegality of the subject contract” and that it “is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nThe City further contends that because “no evidence can be introduced at trial to\n\nsupport a finding that the [c]ontract was not illegal or contrary to public policy, the\n\nagreement fails as a matter of law.” The City also argues that Garcia “cannot present\n\nany evidence at trial [which would legalize] the agreement.” The City attached exhibits\n\nto the motion as previously described.\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, it appears that the City attempted to invoke both a\n\ntraditional motion for summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a and\n\na no evidence motion for summary judgment under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n166a(i).   Compare TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (providing for summary judgment where\n\n“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law”) with TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i) (providing for summary\n\njudgment where there is “no evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or\n\ndefense”).\n\n       While it is acceptable to file “hybrid” motions for summary judgment invoking both\n\nbases for summary judgment, the Texas Supreme Court has noted that a “better\n\npractice” is to file separate motions, or at least to include headings that clearly delineate\n\nand segregate the two bases for summary judgment. See Binur v. Jacobo, 135 S.W.3d\n\n646, 651 (Tex. 2004); see Pitts v. Winkler County, 351 S.W.3d 564, 570 (Tex. App.—El\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fPaso 2011, no pet.). The supreme court, however, does not require litigants to follow\n\nthis practice. Binur, 135 S.W.3d at 651.\n\n      When a party moves for both traditional and a no-evidence summary judgment,\n\nwe first review the trial court’s judgment under the standards of rule 166a(i). Ford Motor\n\nCo. v. Ridgway, 135 S.W.3d 598, 600 (Tex. 2004); All Am. Tel., Inc. v. USLD\n\nCommuns., Inc., 291 S.W.3d 518, 526 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, pet. denied). If the\n\nnon-movant failed to produce more than a scintilla of evidence under that burden, then\n\nthere is no need to analyze whether the movant’s summary judgment proof satisfied the\n\nrule 166a(c) burden. Id.\n\n                     IV. NO EVIDENCE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n      We review a no-evidence motion for summary judgment under the same legal\n\nsufficiency standard used to review a directed verdict. King Ranch, Inc. v. Chapman,\n\n118 S.W.3d 742, 750–51 (Tex. 2003). The Rule of Civil Procedure concerning no-\n\nevidence motions for summary judgment delineates the requirements for a no-evidence\n\nmotion as follows:\n\n      After adequate time for discovery, a party without presenting summary\n      judgment evidence may move for summary judgment on the ground that\n      there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or\n      defense on which an adverse party would have the burden of proof at trial.\n      The motion must state the elements as to which there is no evidence. The\n      court must grant the motion unless the respondent produces summary\n      judgment evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact.\n\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see Oasis Oil Corp. v. Koch Ref. Co., 60 S.W.3d 248, 250 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied). Once a no-evidence motion for summary\n\njudgment has been filed, the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to present evidence\n\nraising an issue of material fact as to the elements specified in the motion.       Mack\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\fTrucks, Inc. v. Tamez, 206 S.W.3d 572, 581–82 (Tex. 2006). The trial court should not\n\ngrant a no-evidence motion for summary judgment if the non-movant brings forth more\n\nthan a scintilla of probative evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the\n\nchallenged element. Smith v. O’Donnell, 288 S.W.3d 417, 424 (Tex. 2009). More than\n\na scintilla of evidence exists if the evidence would enable reasonable and fair-minded\n\njurors to differ in their conclusions. Hamilton v. Wilson, 249 S.W.3d 425, 427 (Tex.\n\n2008) (per curiam). We review the evidence presented by the motion and response in\n\nthe light most favorable to the party against whom the summary judgment was\n\nrendered, crediting evidence favorable to that party if reasonable jurors could, and\n\ndisregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not. Mack Trucks, Inc.,\n\n206 S.W.3d at 581–82; King Ranch, Inc., 118 S.W.3d at 750.\n\n      Garcia argues in his first issue that, to the extent the City attempts to raise a no-\n\nevidence motion for summary judgment, the City’s motion for summary judgment should\n\nfail because the City has not identified any elements on which Garcia would have the\n\nburden of proof at trial and for which there was no evidence. In connection with this\n\nissue, Garcia argues that the motion fails to give fair notice regarding which elements\n\nthe City specifically challenges and further argues that he does not have the burden of\n\nproof regarding grounds for setting aside the contract. We agree.\n\n      A trial court cannot grant a traditional or no-evidence summary judgment motion\n\non grounds not presented in the motion. Timpte Indus. v. Gish, 286 S.W.3d 306, 310–\n\n11 (Tex. 2009). A no-evidence motion must be specific in challenging the evidentiary\n\nsupport for an element of a claim or defense because the no-evidence rule “does not\n\nauthorize conclusory motions or general no-evidence challenges to an opponent’s\n\n\n\n                                           10\n\fcase.” Id. (quoting TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i) cmt.). The purpose of this requirement is to\n\nprovide the opposing party with adequate information to oppose the motion and to\n\ndefine the issues. Timpte Indus., 286 S.W.3d at 310; Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v.\n\nAlvarez, 576 S.W.2d 771, 772 (Tex. 1978). This purpose is analogous to the “fair\n\nnotice” requirements for pleadings under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Timpte\n\nIndus., 286 S.W.3d at 310; Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 576 S.W.2d at 772–73; see TEX.\n\nR. CIV. P. 45(b) (requiring a party’s pleadings to give “fair notice” to the opponent); TEX.\n\nR. CIV. P. 47(a) (requiring a plaintiff’s pleadings to give “fair notice of the claim\n\ninvolved”).\n\n       The City’s motion for summary judgment states that “no evidence can be\n\nintroduced at trial to support a finding that the Contract was not illegal or contrary to\n\npublic policy,” and further states that “[p]laintiff cannot present any evidence at trial [that]\n\nlegalized the agreement.”       We conclude that the motion failed to give fair notice\n\nregarding the elements of the claim or defense as to which the City contends that there\n\nis no evidence. Timpte Indus., 286 S.W.3d at 310. Thus, the City’s motion was the\n\ntype of conclusory or general no-evidence challenge to an opponent’s case barred by\n\nrule 166a(i). Timpte Indus., 286 S.W.3d at 310; see TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i) cmt.\n\n       Moreover, and saliently, under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), the City\n\ncould only bring a no-evidence motion for summary judgment on a claim or defense on\n\nwhich Garcia would have the burden of proof at trial. Oasis Oil Corp. v. Koch Ref. Co.\n\nL.P., 60 S.W.3d 248, 254 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2001, pet. denied). In this case,\n\nthe City, as the plaintiff in this declaratory judgment action, is attempting to set aside the\n\ncontract on grounds that it is illegal, void, and against public policy. The City’s motion\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\ffor summary judgment asserts that “inasmuch as the contract is void and because no\n\nevidence can be introduced at trial to support a finding that the contract was not illegal\n\nor contrary to public policy, the agreement fails as a matter of law.” The City’s motion\n\nfurther asserts that Garcia did not perform as obligated; that the transaction was at all\n\ntimes without legal authority; and that the transfer of property was not conducted as\n\nrequired by the Texas Local Government Code.\n\n       The party with the burden of proof at trial has the same burden of proof in the\n\nsummary judgment proceeding. Waite v. Woodard, Hall, Prim, P.C., 137 S.W.3d 277,\n\n281 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2004, no pet.); Oasis Oil Corp., 60 S.W.3d at 252.\n\nThe City has the burden of proof at trial to prove that the contract is illegal; that it is\n\nagainst public policy; that Garcia did not perform as obligated; that the transaction was\n\nwithout legal authority; and that the transfer of property was not properly conducted.\n\nSee Plano Surgery Ctr. v. New You Weight Mgmt. Ctr., 265 S.W.3d 496, 501–502 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2008, no pet.) (holding that when “illegality does not appear on the face of\n\nthe contract, it will not be held illegal and thus void unless the facts showing its illegality\n\nare before the court”); Franklin v. Jackson, 847 S.W.2d 306, 310 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n\n1992, writ denied) (“The presumption being in favor of legality, the burden of proof is on\n\nthe party asserting the illegality.”); see Lewis v. Davis, 199 S.W.2d 146, 149 (Tex. 1947)\n\n(“But where the illegality does not appear on the face of the contract it will not be held\n\nvoid unless the facts showing its illegality are before the court.”); Kottwitz v.\n\nRepresentatives Alexander, 34 Tex. 689, 1869 Tex. LEXIS 149, at *7 (Tex. 1869) (“All\n\npresumptions of law are in favor of the legality of a contract.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f       The City could not properly assert a no-evidence motion for summary judgment\n\non the issues for which it has the burden of proof. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i); see\n\nThomas v. Omar Invs., Inc., 156 S.W.3d 681, 684 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2005, no pet.);\n\nNowak v. DAS Inv. Corp., 110 S.W.3d 677, 680–81 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.]\n\n2003, no pet.); Oasis Oil Corp., 60 S.W.3d at 252. Moreover, Garcia has not asserted\n\nany affirmative defenses on which the City could have filed a no-evidence motion.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court could not have properly granted the City’s no-evidence\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       To the extent that the City’s motion for summary judgment was brought under the\n\nno-evidence standard, it was legally insufficient as a matter of law. We now turn our\n\nattention to the City’s motion for summary judgment insofar as it can be characterized to\n\ninvoke traditional grounds for summary judgment.\n\n                     V. TRADITIONAL MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       Garcia contends that the City’s motion for summary judgment fails to state a\n\nproper ground for summary judgment because it refers to rule 166a(b); this rule,\n\nhowever, concerns summary judgments for the “defending party,” and the City is the\n\nplaintiff in this case. As stated previously, the City’s motion states that it is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment pursuant to “Rule 166(b)” of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nRule 166a(b) is entitled “Summary Judgment for Defending Party” and states: “[a] party\n\nagainst whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory\n\njudgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a\n\nsummary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f      In the instant case, the City, as plaintiff, sought a declaratory judgment against\n\nGarcia, as defendant. Garcia filed a general denial, but has not alleged any claim,\n\ncounterclaim, or cross-claim in this lawsuit. Therefore, rule 166a(b) cannot be used as\n\na statutory basis for the City’s summary judgment. See id. However, the express\n\nlanguage of the City’s motion for summary judgment recites the correct standard of\n\nreview for a traditional motion for summary judgment under rule 166a(c) in that the City\n\nstates there is no “genuine issue of material fact” and it is “entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.” See id. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). Accordingly, we will examine the City’s\n\nmotion under the standard of review applicable to traditional motions for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n      In reviewing a traditional motion for summary judgment, the reviewing court must\n\napply the following well-established standards: (1) the movant for summary judgment\n\nhas the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law; (2) in deciding whether there is a disputed\n\nmaterial fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the non-\n\nmovant will be taken as true; and (3) every reasonable inference must be indulged in\n\nfavor of the non-movant, and any doubts resolved in its favor. Am. Tobacco Co. v.\n\nGrinnell, 951 S.W.2d 420, 425 (Tex. 1997); Nixon v. Mr. Prop. Mgmt. Co., 690 S.W.2d\n\n546, 548–49 (Tex. 1985).\n\n      A party moving for traditional summary judgment under rule 166a has the burden\n\nto establish that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Diversicare General Partner, Inc.\n\nv. Rubio, 185 S.W.3d 842, 846 (Tex. 2005). Once the movant establishes a right to\n\n\n\n                                           14\n\fsummary judgment as a matter of law, the burden then shifts to the non-movant to\n\npresent evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact. See City of Houston v. Clear\n\nCreek Basin Authority, 589 S.W.2d 671, 678–79 (Tex. 1979); Scown v. Neie, 225\n\nS.W.3d 303, 307 (Tex. App—El Paso 2006, pet. denied).\n\n       When the plaintiff moves for summary judgment, it must conclusively prove each\n\nelement of the cause of action as a matter of law. Swilley v. Hughes, 488 S.W.2d 64,\n\n67 (Tex. 1972); Ortega-Carter v. Am. Int’l Adjustment Co., 834 S.W.2d 439, 441 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 1992, writ denied). The plaintiff meets the burden if it produces evidence\n\nthat is sufficient to support an instructed verdict at trial. See Brownlee v. Brownlee, 665\n\nS.W.2d 111, 112 (Tex. 1984).\n\n       Garcia contends that “[o]n a fundamental level, the motion repeatedly fails to\n\nidentify or address the legal grounds required for summary judgment, and fails to\n\nsupport those grounds with evidence.” We agree. The City has not met its burden to\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Diversicare General Partner, Inc., 185 S.W.3d\n\nat 846. Although the City’s motion included a copy of the City’s resolution regarding the\n\nsale and a promissory note, it did not include any affidavits or other evidence to support\n\nthe facts alleged in its motion for summary judgment.          See United Blood Servs. v.\n\nLongoria, 938 S.W.2d 29, 30 (Tex. 1997) (summary judgment evidence must be\n\nadmissible under the Rules of Evidence). In short, the City did not include any evidence\n\nthat would show that the contract was illegal, void, against public policy, or in violation of\n\nstatutory requirements.      The City did not produce evidence (1) rebutting the\n\npresumption that the contract was legal and in conformance with the constitutional\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\frequirements for transactions involving municipalities; (2) showing that the contract was\n\nagainst public policy; (3) showing that Garcia did not perform under the contract as\n\nobligated; or (4) establishing that the sale and transfer of property was not conducted as\n\nrequired by the Texas Local Government Code.\n\n      The City’s summary judgment proof is legally insufficient to carry its burden. See\n\nCity of Houston, 589 S.W.2d at 678 (\"The trial court may not grant a summary judgment\n\nby default for lack of an answer or response to the motion by the non-movant when the\n\nmovant's summary judgment proof is legally insufficient.\"); McConnell v. Southside\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 858 S.W.2d 337, 342 (Tex. 1993) (stating that a “summary judgment\n\nmust stand or fall on its own merits and the non-movant's failure to except or respond\n\ncannot supply by default the grounds for summary judgment or the summary judgment\n\nproof necessary to establish the movant's right.”). Accordingly, the trial court could not\n\nhave properly granted summary judgment in favor of the City based on a traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we sustain Garcia’s first issue.\n\n                                    VI. CONCLUSION\n\n      To the extent that the City’s motion for summary judgment was premised on no-\n\nevidence grounds under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), the motion was fatally\n\ndefective because it was conclusory and general, and was not filed on a claim or\n\ndefense on which Garcia had the burden of proof. To the extent that the motion was\n\npremised on traditional summary judgment grounds under rule 166a, the City failed to\n\nmeet its burden to show that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on traditional\n\nsummary judgment grounds.\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f       Because we have concluded that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on either basis, we need not address Garcia’s remaining issues on appeal.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1, 47.4. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand\n\nthis case for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                       ___________________________________\n                                       GREGORY T.

By five issues, Garcia argues that: (1) the City failed to state valid grounds\n\nfor summary judgment where its motion expressly relies only on “Rule 166b, 166i Texas\n\fRules of Civil Procedure,” see generally TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a; (2) the City was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment under Texas Local Government Code section 272.001\n\nbecause it failed to identify a specific statutory violation and failed to present evidence\n\nregarding any alleged violation, see TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 272.001 (West Supp.\n\n2011) (requiring public notice regarding the sale or exchange of land by a political\n\nsubdivision); (3) the City failed to assert or prove noncompliance with Texas Local\n\nGovernment Code section 253.008, see id. § 253.008 (West 2005) (establishing\n\nrequirements for the sale of real property by a municipality by public auction); (4) the\n\nCity was not entitled to summary judgment under the Texas Constitution because it did\n\nnot acknowledge or address the “public purpose” test for analyzing whether a\n\ntransaction is improper and there was evidence the transaction met that test, see TEX.\n\nCONST., art. XI, § 3 (prohibiting a municipal corporation from becoming “a subscriber to\n\nthe capital of any private corporation or association,” making “any appropriation or\n\ndonation to the same, or in anywise [lending] its credit”); and (5) the City was not\n\nentitled to summary judgment on “public policy” grounds when there was no evidence of\n\nviolation of any state statute or public policy grounds.1 We reverse and remand.\n\n                                         I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The City filed a three-page petition for declaratory judgment which alleged that\n\nthe City entered into an agreement to transfer real property to Garcia pursuant to City of\n\nElsa Resolution No. 01-07; that it extended credit to Garcia pursuant to a promissory\n\nnote which was contrary to the laws of the State of Texas; and that Garcia defaulted on\n\nthe promissory note. The City’s pleading did not give any other background facts, did\n\n       1\n         At oral argument, Garcia waived and abandoned his fourth issue, that any statutory violation\nwas cured by the validation statute. As such, we will not address Garcia’s fourth issue.\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fnot provide any specific statutory or other legal basis for invalidating the transaction,\n\nand did not further identify either the real property or the loan agreement. The City’s\n\npleading for declaratory relief asked that the trial court declare the contract between the\n\nparties to be invalid. The relevant paragraph of the petition states, in its entirety:\n\n        City incorporates the factual allegations as set forth above. In accordance\n        with the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code § 31.001 et. seq., City\n        requests that this Court declare the rights, duties, obligations of the parties\n        involved in the real estate transaction between City and Defendant\n        [Garcia], specifically the agreement attached as Exhibit A.\n\nNo “Exhibit A” or any other document was attached to the City’s petition. In response,\n\nGarcia filed a general denial.\n\n        The City moved for summary judgment on grounds that the contract between the\n\nCity and Garcia is void because it is an illegal contract and is against public policy.\n\nSpecifically, the City alleged that the contract was illegal because, inter alia, it sold its\n\nproperty to Garcia without complying with the public auction and sealed bid\n\nrequirements of Texas Local Government Code section 253.0082 and without meeting\n\nthe notice and publication requirements of Texas Local Government Code section\n\n272.001.3 See TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 253.008, 272.001. The City also alleged\n\nin its motion that the agreement is unconstitutional under article XI, sections 3, 5, and 7\n\nof the Texas Constitution, and quoted section 3. See TEX. CONST. art. XI, §§ 3, 5, 7. In\n\nthis regard, the City’s argument, in its entirety, is as follows:\n\n        2\n           Texas Local Government Code section 253.008 provides: “The government body of a\nmunicipality may sell real property owned by the municipality by public auction or by sealed bid under\nSection 272.001.” TEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 253.008 (West 2005).\n\n        3\n          Texas Local Government Code section 272.001 provides that before land owned by a political\nsubdivision of the state may be sold, notice to the general public of the offer of the land for sale or\nexchange must be published in a newspaper of general circulation on two separate dates, and the sale\nmay not occur until after the 14th day after the date of the second publication. See id.. § 272.001 (West\nSupp. 2011).\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f       [Garcia] is not obligated to pay anything, including interest, for five years,\n       and nothing was done by [the] City to make sure that [Garcia] did not\n       transfer the property of [sic] do the economic development that [Garcia]\n       had to do. The purported agreement at issue is illegal as far as Texas\n       Constitution, Texas Statute, City Charter, and against public policy.\n       Plaintiff[4] cannot present any evidence at trial [that] legalized the\n       agreement. Further, the purported agreement is illegal or against public\n       policy as it defeats the purpose of the City of Elsa coffers which is to\n       benefit all citizens of the City, not a specific individual. Therefore, the\n       purported agreement is illegal and against public policy and should be\n       declared void by this Honorable Court.\n\nNo affidavit, deposition or other testimonial evidence is attached to the City’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment which would support the background facts included in its motion. A\n\ncopy of a document entitled “Resolution No. 01-07” is attached as exhibit A, and a copy\n\nof a document entitled “Promissory Note” is attached as exhibit B. The City did not\n\nauthenticate either document, or support them by affidavit, and the City did not provide\n\nany evidentiary support for any fact alleged in its motion for summary judgment. Exhibit\n\nA to the motion for summary judgment is a resolution passed by the City authorizing the\n\nconveyance of the described property. Exhibit B is a promissory note between the City,\n\nas lender, and Garcia, as borrower. The property referenced in the resolution is the\n\nsame property that is identified as the security for payment of the promissory note.\n\n       Garcia filed a response to the City’s motion for summary judgment.                                In his\n\nresponse, Garcia discussed the background facts surrounding the transaction and\n\ngenerally rebutted the City’s arguments. In support of his response, he submitted nine\n\nexhibits which were authenticated by affidavit.5 However, Garcia did not include any\n\nevidence which would support the facts alleged in his response.\n\n\n       4\n           The City is the “plaintiff” in this lawsuit; thus, the reference must be to Garcia, as defendant.\n       5\n         The exhibits include: “Resolution No. 01-07” dated February 20, 2001; “Promissory Note” dated\nMarch 2, 2001; “Warranty Deed with Vendor’s Lien” dated March 2, 2001; “Warranty Deed with Vendor’s\n\n                                                        4\n\f        The trial court granted the City’s motion for summary judgment. It ordered that\n\n“the promissory note between the City of Elsa and Roy Garcia attached as Exhibit A to\n\nthis Order is void and that the title to the property therein described revert back to the\n\nCity of Elsa.” The trial court further ordered that “the City of Elsa reimburse Roy Garcia\n\nthe sum of $2,866.98 for payments he made to the City under the void promissory\n\nnote.” This appeal ensued.\n\n                                       II.

TRADITIONAL OR NO-EVIDENCE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       In his first issue, Garcia argues that the City did not state valid grounds for\n\nsummary judgment when it (1) expressly relied only on “rule “166b, 166i Texas Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure,” although no such rules exist; (2) rule 166a(b) concerns summary\n\njudgment for a defendant and the City was the plaintiff; and (3) the City did not state any\n\nelements for which Garcia had the burden of proof and for which he had no evidence,\n\nthereby failing to comply with the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to no-\n\nevidence motions for summary judgment.\n\n       The City’s motion for summary judgment incorrectly refers to “166b, 166i Texas\n\nRules of Civil Procedure.”     Therefore, as a threshold matter, we must determine\n\nwhether the City’s motion for summary judgment is in substance a traditional or no-\n\nevidence motion so that we may apply the appropriate standard of review.

Compare TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (providing for summary judgment where\n\n“there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law”) with TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(i) (providing for summary\n\njudgment where there is “no evidence of one or more essential elements of a claim or\n\ndefense”).\n\n       While it is acceptable to file “hybrid” motions for summary judgment invoking both\n\nbases for summary judgment, the Texas Supreme Court has noted that a “better\n\npractice” is to file separate motions, or at least to include headings that clearly delineate\n\nand segregate the two bases for summary judgment.

Mack Trucks, Inc.,\n\n206 S.W.3d at 581–82; King Ranch, Inc., 118 S.W.3d at 750.\n\n      Garcia argues in his first issue that, to the extent the City attempts to raise a no-\n\nevidence motion for summary judgment, the City’s motion for summary judgment should\n\nfail because the City has not identified any elements on which Garcia would have the\n\nburden of proof at trial and for which there was no evidence. In connection with this\n\nissue, Garcia argues that the motion fails to give fair notice regarding which elements\n\nthe City specifically challenges and further argues that he does not have the burden of\n\nproof regarding grounds for setting aside the contract.

P. 47(a) (requiring a plaintiff’s pleadings to give “fair notice of the claim\n\ninvolved”).\n\n       The City’s motion for summary judgment states that “no evidence can be\n\nintroduced at trial to support a finding that the Contract was not illegal or contrary to\n\npublic policy,” and further states that “[p]laintiff cannot present any evidence at trial [that]\n\nlegalized the agreement.”       We conclude that the motion failed to give fair notice\n\nregarding the elements of the claim or defense as to which the City contends that there\n\nis no evidence. Timpte Indus., 286 S.W.3d at 310. Thus, the City’s motion was the\n\ntype of conclusory or general no-evidence challenge to an opponent’s case barred by\n\nrule 166a(i).

Moreover, Garcia has not asserted\n\nany affirmative defenses on which the City could have filed a no-evidence motion.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court could not have properly granted the City’s no-evidence\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n       To the extent that the City’s motion for summary judgment was brought under the\n\nno-evidence standard, it was legally insufficient as a matter of law. We now turn our\n\nattention to the City’s motion for summary judgment insofar as it can be characterized to\n\ninvoke traditional grounds for summary judgment.\n\n                     V. TRADITIONAL MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n\n       Garcia contends that the City’s motion for summary judgment fails to state a\n\nproper ground for summary judgment because it refers to rule 166a(b); this rule,\n\nhowever, concerns summary judgments for the “defending party,” and the City is the\n\nplaintiff in this case. As stated previously, the City’s motion states that it is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment pursuant to “Rule 166(b)” of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nRule 166a(b) is entitled “Summary Judgment for Defending Party” and states: “[a] party\n\nagainst whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory\n\njudgment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting affidavits for a\n\nsummary judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(b).\n\n\n\n\n                                             13\n\f      In the instant case, the City, as plaintiff, sought a declaratory judgment against\n\nGarcia, as defendant. Garcia filed a general denial, but has not alleged any claim,\n\ncounterclaim, or cross-claim in this lawsuit. Therefore, rule 166a(b) cannot be used as\n\na statutory basis for the City’s summary judgment. See id. However, the express\n\nlanguage of the City’s motion for summary judgment recites the correct standard of\n\nreview for a traditional motion for summary judgment under rule 166a(c) in that the City\n\nstates there is no “genuine issue of material fact” and it is “entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.” See id. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). Accordingly, we will examine the City’s\n\nmotion under the standard of review applicable to traditional motions for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n      In reviewing a traditional motion for summary judgment, the reviewing court must\n\napply the following well-established standards: (1) the movant for summary judgment\n\nhas the burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact, and that it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law; (2) in deciding whether there is a disputed\n\nmaterial fact issue precluding summary judgment, evidence favorable to the non-\n\nmovant will be taken as true; and (3) every reasonable inference must be indulged in\n\nfavor of the non-movant, and any doubts resolved in its favor.

The City has not met its burden to\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as\n\na matter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c); Diversicare General Partner, Inc., 185 S.W.3d\n\nat 846. Although the City’s motion included a copy of the City’s resolution regarding the\n\nsale and a promissory note, it did not include any affidavits or other evidence to support\n\nthe facts alleged in its motion for summary judgment.          See United Blood Servs. v.\n\nLongoria, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369776\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369776/united-blood-services-v-longoria/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30 (Tex. 1997) (summary judgment evidence must be\n\nadmissible under the Rules of Evidence). In short, the City did not include any evidence\n\nthat would show that the contract was illegal, void, against public policy, or in violation of\n\nstatutory requirements.      The City did not produce evidence (1) rebutting the\n\npresumption that the contract was legal and in conformance with the constitutional\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\frequirements for transactions involving municipalities; (2) showing that the contract was\n\nagainst public policy; (3) showing that Garcia did not perform under the contract as\n\nobligated; or (4) establishing that the sale and transfer of property was not conducted as\n\nrequired by the Texas Local Government Code.\n\n      The City’s summary judgment proof is legally insufficient to carry its burden. See\n\nCity of Houston, 589 S.W.2d at 678 (\"The trial court may not grant a summary judgment\n\nby default for lack of an answer or response to the motion by the non-movant when the\n\nmovant's summary judgment proof is legally insufficient.\"); McConnell v.

Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1746247\"><a href=\"/opinion/1746247/mcconnell-v-southside-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 342 (Tex. 1993) (stating that a “summary judgment\n\nmust stand or fall on its own merits and the non-movant's failure to except or respond\n\ncannot supply by default the grounds for summary judgment or the summary judgment\n\nproof necessary to establish the movant's right.”). Accordingly, the trial court could not\n\nhave properly granted summary judgment in favor of the City based on a traditional\n\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, we sustain Garcia’s first issue.\n\n                                    VI. CONCLUSION\n\n      To the extent that the City’s motion for summary judgment was premised on no-\n\nevidence grounds under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 166a(i), the motion was fatally\n\ndefective because it was conclusory and general, and was not filed on a claim or\n\ndefense on which Garcia had the burden of proof. To the extent that the motion was\n\npremised on traditional summary judgment grounds under rule 166a, the City failed to\n\nmeet its burden to show that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on traditional\n\nsummary judgment grounds.\n\n\n\n                                           16\n\f       Because we have concluded that the trial court erred in granting summary\n\njudgment on either basis, we need not address Garcia’s remaining issues on appeal.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1, 47.4. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand\n\nthis case for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                       ___________________________________\n                                       GREGORY T.
