Vincent Faris, Clermont County Prosecuting Attorney, Nicholas Horton, 76 South\nRiverside Drive, 2nd Floor, Batavia, Ohio 45103, for plaintiff-appellee\n\nW. Stephen Haynes, Clermont County Public Defender, Robert F. Benintendi, 302 East Main\nStreet, Batavia, Ohio 45103, for defendant-appellant\n\n\n\n        RINGLAND, J.\n\n        {¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Michael Workman, appeals his conviction and sentence in\n\nthe Clermont County Court of Common Pleas for multiple sexual offenses. For the reasons\n\ndetailed below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this matter to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n        {¶ 2} This is a consolidated case involving two victims of Workman's sexual abuse.\n\nThe first case involved allegations of sexual abuse committed against R.C., a 13-year-old\n\f                                                                           Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                                    CA2016-12-083\n\nfriend of Workman's stepson. Following the disclosure of this incident, another victim, E.Z.,\n\ncame forward with allegations that Workman had repeatedly sexually abused him for nearly a\n\ndecade.\n\n       {¶ 3} Workman was indicted on February 11, 2016 for two counts of rape in violation\n\nof R.C. 2907.02 and two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05 for the\n\nsexual abuse committed against R.C. Thereafter, on March 24, 2016, Workman was indicted\n\nfor the sexual abuse committed against E.Z. The indictment listed 17 counts. Counts 1-6\n\nwere for rapes occurring in Hamilton County between 1999 and 2000.1 Counts 7-8 were for\n\ndrug offenses between May 1, 2007 and September 1, 2007 where Workman had allegedly\n\nprovided E.Z. with drugs to sedate him. Counts 9-10 were rape charges during the same\n\nMay 1, 2007 to September 1, 2007 time frame alleging that Workman used drugs to sedate\n\nE.Z. in order to facilitate sexual abuse. Counts 11-17 were for rapes occurring in Clermont\n\nCounty between 2006 and 2008.\n\n       {¶ 4} The trial court granted the state's motion to consolidate the two cases and the\n\nmatter was tried to a jury.\n\n                                                  R.C.\n\n       {¶ 5} R.C. testified that on November 15, 2015, he was in Workman's bedroom\n\nplaying video games with Workman's stepson. Workman was also in the bedroom playing a\n\ncomputer video game. R.C. stated that at some point he became tired and fell asleep on\n\nWorkman's bed.\n\n       {¶ 6} When he awoke, R.C. stated that Workman was performing oral sex on him.\n\nThough he fell asleep fully clothed, R.C. testified that his pants and underwear had been\n\npulled down and Workman's mouth was on his penis. R.C. stated that Workman stopped\n\n\n1. E.Z. was under the age of 13 for Counts 1-6. For Counts 7-11, the state sought to prove that the sexual\nconduct occurred by force or threat of force.\n\n                                                   -2-\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\nperforming oral sex on him when he awoke and began moving. R.C. explained that\n\nWorkman let go of him and shifted to make it look like he was playing his video game. R.C.\n\nthen left the room.\n\n       {¶ 7} R.C.'s family testified that R.C. returned home distraught. R.C.'s grandmother\n\ntestified that R.C. came home, sat in a rocking chair, acted very nervous, and pulled his\n\nsweatshirt over his head while sobbing. R.C. did not initially disclose what had occurred, but\n\nwhen asked whether someone had hurt him, he responded \"it's worse than that.\" R.C.\n\ncontinued to cry, but would not disclose the abuse. R.C. stated only that it was \"disgusting.\"\n\n       {¶ 8} The family was eventually able to persuade R.C. to disclose the abuse to his\n\naunt. After the disclosure, R.C. was taken to the hospital where a rape kit examination was\n\nperformed and R.C. was interviewed by social workers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.\n\nDNA analysis revealed the presence of amylase, an enzyme found in saliva, on R.C.'s\n\nunderwear. Further analysis revealed that Workman could not be excluded as a source for\n\nthe DNA and that only one in nearly 50,000 people would match the DNA found in R.C.'s\n\nunderwear. Additionally, the swab taken from R.C.'s penis revealed the presence of amylase\n\nand Workman could not be excluded as a source. Only one in 90,000 individuals would\n\nmatch the DNA found on R.C.'s penis.\n\n                                            E.Z.\n\n       {¶ 9} Following the evidence of abuse pertaining to R.C., the state shifted its case to\n\nthe abuse committed against E.Z.\n\n       {¶ 10} The state presented evidence that Workman had a familial relationship with\n\nthe victim's family. Workman lived with the victim at three separate residences: (1) a\n\nresidence in Hamilton County, Ohio between 1999-2000, (2) a residence in Florida between\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f                                                                          Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                                   CA2016-12-083\n\n2000-2006, and (3) a residence in Clermont County from 2006 onward.2\n\n         {¶ 11} E.Z. testified about the first instance of sexual abuse occurring in Hamilton\n\nCounty and several incidents that occurred prior to the family moving to Florida. The sexual\n\nabuse continued throughout the time they resided in Florida and when they returned to Ohio\n\nin 2006. At trial, E.Z. recounted various incidents of sexual abuse occurring in Clermont\n\nCounty, including incidents in which Workman used controlled substances in the commission\n\nof the abuse. The sexual activity stopped in 2008 when E.Z. forcefully ended the abuse and\n\nthreatened to report him.\n\n                                               Verdict\n\n         {¶ 12} Prior to deliberation, the trial court granted a Crim.R. 29 motion for Counts 7\n\nand 8 of the indictment in E.Z.'s case for corrupting another with drugs.               Following\n\ndeliberations, the jury found Workman guilty of all four Counts against R.C. and the\n\nremaining 15 Counts against E.Z. The trial court merged all four Counts involving R.C. and\n\nordered Workman to serve an 11-year prison term for that Count of rape. The 15 rape\n\nCounts involving E.Z. were not merged and the trial court ordered ten years for each\n\nconviction. All sentences were ordered consecutively for a total stated prison term of 161\n\nyears. Workman now appeals the decision of the trial court, raising five assignments of error\n\nfor review. For ease of discussion, Workman's assignments of error will be addressed out of\n\norder.\n\n         {¶ 13} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n         {¶ 14} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S RULE 29 MOTION\n\nAS THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED WAS INSUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE THAT GUILT HAD\n\nBEEN PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\n\n\n2. These was some confusion as to the precise dates when the family moved to Florida.\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\n      {¶ 15} Assignment of Error No. 2:\n\n      {¶ 16} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ENTERING A FINDING OF GUILTY\n\nBECAUSE SUCH VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE\n\nEVIDENCE.\n\n      {¶ 17} Workman's first and second assignments of error relate to Counts 3, 6, 10, 13,\n\n15, and 16. Each Count was for rape against E.Z. Workman argues that his convictions are\n\nnot supported by sufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nWe will address each argument below.\n\n      {¶ 18} Rape is defined in R.C. 2907.02, which provides:\n\n             (1) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who\n             is not the spouse of the offender or who is the spouse of the\n             offender but is living separate and apart from the offender, when\n             any of the following applies:\n\n             (a) For the purpose of preventing resistance, the offender\n             substantially impairs the other person’s judgment or control by\n             administering any drug, intoxicant, or controlled substance to the\n             other person surreptitiously or by force, threat of force, or\n             deception.\n\n             (b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether\n             or not the offender knows the age of the other person.\n\n             (c) The other person’s ability to resist or consent is substantially\n             impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of\n             advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause\n             to believe that the other person’s ability to resist or consent is\n             substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition\n             or because of advanced age.\n\n             (2) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when\n             the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by\n             force or threat of force.\n\n      {¶ 19} Crim.R. 29(A) provides that \"[t]he court on motion of a defendant or on its own\n\nmotion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of\n\nacquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\noffenses.\" An appellate court reviews the denial of a Crim.R. 29(A) motion pursuant to the\n\nsame standard as that used to review a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. State v. Mota,\n\n12th Dist. Warren No. CA2007-06-082, 2008-Ohio-4163, ¶ 5.\n\n        {¶ 20} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal\n\nconviction, an appellate court examines the evidence in order to determine whether such\n\nevidence, if believed, would support a conviction. State v. Boles, 12th Dist. Brown No.\n\nCA2012-06-012, 2013-Ohio-5202, ¶ 34. The relevant inquiry is \"whether, after viewing the\n\nevidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" State v.\n\nWatson, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2014-08-110, 2015-Ohio-2321, ¶ 22. In other words, the\n\ntest for sufficiency requires a determination as to whether the state has met its burden of\n\nproduction at trial. State v. Wilson, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2006-01-007, 2007-Ohio-2298,\n\n¶ 34.\n\n        {¶ 21} A manifest weight challenge concerns the inclination of the greater amount of\n\ncredible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\n\nState v. Vunda, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-07-130 and CA2013-07-113, 2014-Ohio-3449,\n\n¶ 34. In assessing whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, a\n\nreviewing court examines the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable\n\ninferences, considers the credibility of the witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving\n\nconflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest\n\nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. State v.\n\nSess, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-06-117, 2016-Ohio-5560, ¶ 13.\n\n        {¶ 22} Although the concepts of sufficiency of the evidence and weight of the\n\nevidence are legally distinct, as this court has observed, a finding that a conviction is\n\nsupported by the manifest weight of the evidence is also dispositive of the issue of\n                                             -6-\n\f                                                                  Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                           CA2016-12-083\n\nsufficiency. State v. Jones, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-03-049, 2013-Ohio-150, ¶ 19.\n\n\"Because sufficiency is required to take a case to the jury, a finding that a conviction is\n\nsupported by the weight of the evidence must necessarily include a finding of sufficiency.\"\n\nState v. Hart, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2011-03-008, 2012-Ohio-1896, ¶ 43.\n\n      {¶ 23} As previously noted, E.Z. testified about the sexual abuse he suffered at the\n\nhands of Workman. E.Z. testified that the sexual abuse began when Workman performed\n\noral sex on him when he was six or seven years old in his bedroom at the Hamilton County\n\nresidence. E.Z. described the sexual abuse as occurring frequently.\n\n      {¶ 24} After a while, but while E.Z. was still six or seven years old, Workman began\n\nperforming anal sex on E.Z. The typical instance of sexual abuse was explained by E.Z.:\n\n             Q. How – how many times, you know, when you're 6 or 7 years\n             old, how often did – did that type of conduct take place?\n\n             A. It was mostly every time after he finished anything orally on\n             me.\n             Q. So would he do something oral on you first?\n             A. Yes.\n             Q. Did he say anything to you after that type of conduct?\n             A. After the – after the unwarranted anal sex?\n             Q. I guess he would perform oral sex on you?\n             A. Yes.\n             Q. And then perform anal sex on you?\n             A. Yes, he would – he would tell me to roll over and – and yes.\n             Q. Do you remember where, or do you recall even when the\n             first time that happened?\n             A. I believe I was in his – well, I mean, at the time it would have\n             been him and my mom's bedroom, but – but it was in the\n             bedroom when we still lived on Roe Street. And – and he had, I\n             mean, he was trying to get me to fall asleep. And I mean, I – I\n             couldn't, because you know, as a kid I wanted to do other things.\n             And – and then that's when he just – he – he was trying to\n\n                                             -7-\n\f                                                                  Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                           CA2016-12-083\n\n              convince me that what he was doing for me, I needed to give him\n              something in return. And that's when he would perform the anal\n              sex.\n              Q. You said it hurt?\n              A. Very much so.\n              Q. Did you cry?\n              A.

However, as addressed in more detail below, the state\n\nappears to have inadvertently skipped over one instance set forth in the indictment and bill of\n\nparticulars.\n\n       {¶ 27} Following a thorough review of the evidence, we find the state presented\n\nsufficient evidence to sustain the majority of Workman's convictions and those convictions\n\nwere not against the manifest weight of the evidence. However, we agree that one offense\n\nwas not proven with any degree of specificity and must be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\n                         Counts 3, 6, 10, 13, and 16 are affirmed\n\n       {¶ 28} For the following Counts, we find the state's evidence is supported by the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence and therefore are also sustained by sufficient evidence.\n\n                                           Count 6\n\n       {¶ 29} Count 6 involved an allegation that Workman had anal sex with E.Z. in the\n\nbathroom of the Hamilton County residence in 2000. The state began by asking E.Z. if anal\n\nsex had occurred in different areas of the house. E.Z. replied in the affirmative and stated\n\nthat it had occurred in his room a few times, in the living room a few times, and in his\n\nbrother's room. The state then inquired if anything had happened in the bathroom, to which\n\nE.Z. responded affirmatively. E.Z. testified that it was following this bathroom incident that\n\nWorkman had told him that the entire situation was his fault, that E.Z. had started it, and that\n\nE.Z. had asked him to \"do those things.\"\n\n       {¶ 30} Workman argues that Count 6 is based on insufficient evidence because \"E.Z.\n\nnever described any sexual conduct occurring in the bathroom.\" Because E.Z. failed to\n\nelaborate, Workman contends that \"[w]e shall never know\" what exactly occurred in the\n\nbathroom. Workman suggests that perhaps a third party might have attempted to use the\n\nbathroom, thereby disrupting the act.\n\n       {¶ 31} When taken into appropriate context, however, the record reveals that\n\nWorkman's Count 6 conviction was based on sufficient evidence and was not against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. In this case, the state was focused on identifying prior\n\ninstances of anal sex and where that activity occurred in the Hamilton County residence.\n\nE.Z. affirmed that \"something\" happened with Workman in the bathroom and went on to\n\nexplain that it was following this incident that Workman began blaming the victim and\n\nasserting that the victim asked him to \"do those things.\" Previously, the victim had also\n\ntestified that Workman had tried to blame him as the reason why the sexual abuse occurred.\n                                             - 10 -\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\n       {¶ 32} Following review, we find the jury could well have inferred that the \"something\"\n\nthat occurred in the bathroom was anal sex, which would be appropriate given the context of\n\nthe testimony. As a result, we find Workman's conviction for Count 6 involving anal sex\n\noccurring in the Hamilton County residence was not against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence.\n\n                                           Count 10\n\n       {¶ 33} Counts 9 and 10 involve instances in which Workman used a sedative to\n\nfacilitate two separate instances of sexual abuse. Workman does not challenge Count 9 in\n\nthis assignment of error. As to Count 10, the state presented the following testimony:\n\n              Q. And now [E.Z.], were there ever any times where the\n              Defendant gave you any substance –\n\n              A. Yes.\n              Q. – to kind of do some of these acts?\n              A. Yes. There were two specific times that I could remember\n              that I know of. And honestly, I mean, thinking back on it there\n              may have been times that he could have put it in my food,\n              because I just * * *. There were two times that he did. There\n              was one time that he gave it to me, and then later that night I fell\n              asleep. It was for – it was because I – I said something about\n              feeling sick or something like that, or I had a headache, and he\n              gave that to me. And then I woke up and he was on top of me,\n              again performing anal sex on me. And I tried to roll over to push\n              him off of me, but because of the medication I was too weak to\n              do so. And then there was another time that he kept telling me\n              to take it, so then I wouldn't remember what happened during.\n              And again, this was when I was older. So then I wouldn't be able\n              to, I guess, fight back as much. But I was still under mental\n              manipulation to not actually tell him no and mean it.\n       {¶ 34} Reviewing E.Z.'s testimony shows that E.Z. was referring to two specific\n\ninstances of sexual abuse: (1) a time when Workman gave E.Z. a drug, E.Z. fell asleep, and\n\nE.Z. woke up to Workman having anal sex with him, and (2) a time when Workman made\n\nE.Z. take a drug to forget the incident.\n\n                                             - 11 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\n       {¶ 35} After review, we find Count 10 is supported by sufficient testimony and is not\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Here, E.Z. testified about a specific scenario\n\nwherein Workman had given him drugs in the context of describing anal sex. We believe that\n\na jury could properly infer that Workman had engaged in anal sex with E.Z. after an incident\n\nin which Workman kept insisting that E.Z. take medication \"so then I wouldn't remember what\n\nhappened during.\" The jury did not clearly lose its way in finding that Workman completed a\n\nsex act on E.Z. with the use of a drug. As a result, we find Workman's conviction for Count\n\n10 is supported by sufficient evidence and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n                                           Count 16\n\n       {¶ 36} Count 16 of the indictment involved an incident where Workman allegedly\n\nperformed oral sex on E.Z. in a closet while E.Z. was reading a comic book. E.Z. testified:\n\n              * * * I went into the closet, because that's where I normally kept\n              them all, and I just sat in there with the light on, and quietly read\n              my comic books to myself. And there was this one night that\n              [Workman] came in there, and he – he went to perform oral sex\n              while – on me while I was reading my – my comic book.\n\n       {¶ 37} Workman cites this language in his brief, focusing specifically on the victim's\n\ntestimony that Workman \"went to perform oral sex.\" Workman argues that the usage of the\n\nterm \"went to perform\" implies that Workman did not complete the sex act, but merely\n\nattempted to do so.\n\n       {¶ 38} However, again, we find Workman's argument is without merit. Workman's\n\nCount 16 conviction for rape is supported by sufficient evidence and is not against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Here, E.Z. testified at length about Workman's sexual\n\nabuse, including that Workman repeatedly performed oral sex on him. In this instance, E.Z.\n\nwas reading a comic book in his closet when Workman \"went to perform oral sex.\" Though\n\nE.Z. testified through the perspective of the event unfolding, it would be reasonable for the\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\njury to conclude that Workman completed the sex act. As a result, we find there was\n\nsufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that sexual conduct had occurred.\n\nTherefore, Count 16 is supported by sufficient evidence and his conviction is not against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence.\n\n                                     Counts 3 and 13\n\n       {¶ 39} We now address Counts 3 and 13. Though the state elicited the victim's\n\ntestimony as to \"triggering events\" to prove the majority of the offenses, there were some\n\noffenses that the state attempted to prove based on the frequency of which the sexual abuse\n\noccurred. Counts 3 and 13 were two such instances of general conduct pursued by the state\n\nbased on the alleged frequency of sexual abuse.\n\n       {¶ 40} Workman argues that his convictions on Counts 3 and 13 are not supported by\n\nsufficient evidence because E.Z. did not present any detail of specificity on those counts.\n\nHowever, it is well established that, \"[a] precise time and date of an alleged offense are not\n\nordinarily essential elements.\" State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-03-063,\n\n2012-Ohio-1289, ¶ 43. In sexual abuse cases involving children, it may be impossible to\n\nprovide a specific date. State v. Vunda, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-07-130, CA2013-07-\n\n113, 2014-Ohio-3449, ¶ 36. \"The problem is compounded where the accused and the victim\n\nare related or reside in the same household, situations which often facilitate an extended\n\nperiod of abuse. An allowance for reasonableness and inexactitude must be made for such\n\ncases.\" Id.\n\n       {¶ 41} In State v. Hemphill, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85431, 2005-Ohio-3726, the\n\nEighth District Court of Appeals reversed some of the defendant's convictions for rape where\n\nthe victim merely testified to numerical estimates of the sexual conduct and provided no\n\ntestimony connected to \"individual, distinguishable incidents.\" Id. at ¶ 88. In that case, the\n\nonly testimony elicited as to several counts was through a numerical estimate:\n                                            - 13 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\n              Q. Do you – can you tell us as to whether or not he had vaginal\n              sex with you, intercourse with you, on at least 33 times?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. Would he – did he touch your breasts at least 33 times?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\nId. at ¶ 11-14. Relying on a case from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Eight District\n\nheld that the state had failed to adequately differentiate these counts and, with three\n\nexceptions, failed to subject each count to individual proof. Id. at ¶ 88, ¶ 112.\n\n       {¶ 42} In contrast, this court decided State v. Morgan, 12th Dist. Brown Nos. CA2009-\n\n07-029 and CA2009-08-033, 2010-Ohio-1720, in which we found sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport multiple rape convictions.\n\n       {¶ 43} In Morgan, the victim testified that the defendant began engaging in sexual\n\nconduct with her when she was five years old. Id. at ¶ 4. The defendant would play \"guess\n\nthe candy game\" with her, where defendant would blindfold the victim and place his penis\n\ninside her mouth. The victim testified that this conduct occurred \"twice a week\" while the\n\nfamily lived in Residence 1. Id. When the family moved to Residence 2, the victim testified\n\nthat the defendant began to have vaginal sex with her. Id. at ¶ 5. According to the victim, the\n\ndefendant had \"come in my room when I was sleeping, my mom was gone and stuck his\n\npenis in my vagina and do what he wanted to do.\" Id. at ¶ 23. The victim testified that the\n\nrape would last for approximately five minutes and occurred \"mainly five times a week.\" Id.\n\nThe victim testified that the intercourse became less frequent after the defendant was injured\n\nby a ladder. Id. Once the family moved to Residence 3, the conduct occurred \"maybe like\n\ntwice a week.\" Id. When the family moved to Residence 4, the victim stated that the\n\ndefendant would put his penis in her vagina \"three to four times a week.\" Id.\n\n       {¶ 44} In considering the victim's testimony, this court found that the victim \"placed\n\n                                             - 14 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\nthe repeated instances of abuse in context of her age, her year in school, and the homes in\n\nwhich she resided.\" Id. at ¶ 24. Therefore, the victim's testimony was not merely general,\n\nambiguous claims of abuse as in Hemphill.\n\n       {¶ 45} We find clear contrasts between the ambiguous, indistinguishable testimony in\n\nHemphill and the case at bar. In the present case, the victim testified of repeated instances\n\nof sexual abuse, including oral and anal sex. By his estimations, E.Z. noted that the abuse\n\noccurred \"once or twice\" a week while living in Hamilton County. E.Z. stated that Workman\n\nhad anal sex with him at the Hamilton County residence multiple times in his room, multiple\n\ntimes in the living room, as well as other instances in the living room and his brother's room.\n\nE.Z. stated that the only place he hadn't been anally abused in the Hamilton County\n\nresidence was in the kitchen and the hallway.\n\n       {¶ 46} Aside from the separate acts testified to in Counts 1 and 2, the state charged\n\nWorkman with one additional count of rape for Count 3. All of those Counts were alleged to\n\nhave occurred in 1999 while E.Z. lived in the Hamilton County residence. Based on the\n\nfrequency of abuse, it would be nearly impossible for E.Z. to remember specific details about\n\nevery single rape that occurred given that this conduct occurred innumerable times over a\n\nspan of nearly a decade. When the state is faced with a victim of continual sexual abuse\n\nwho does not have a distinct memory of details associated with numerous occasions, it is\n\nwithin the confines of due process to permit the state to charge the accused with at least one\n\ncriminal offense for a specific time period. See Vunda, 2014-Ohio-3449 ¶ 35-45.\n\n       {¶ 47} This matter is unlike Hemphill where the only testimony was a numerical\n\nestimate based on mere general, ambiguous claims of abuse. As to Count 3, E.Z. recalled\n\nthe frequency of the abuse, his age, multiple locations where the abuse occurred, and\n\ndistinct memories of abuse.\n\n       {¶ 48} Similarly, Count 13 involved a separate charge of anal rape that occurred in\n                                             - 15 -\n\f                                                                 Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                          CA2016-12-083\n\n2006 while the family lived in the Clermont County residence. Though E.Z. gave specific\n\ntestimony as to Count 12, which also occurred in 2006, E.Z. did not attach any specific\n\nmemory to any other instance of anal sex occurring in 2006. However, because of the\n\nfrequency of abuse, Count 13 was representative of an additional count of anal rape, which\n\noccurred in addition to the specific memory attached to Count 12. Again, E.Z. testified that\n\nWorkman had anal sex multiple times per year at the Clermont County residence, which is in\n\naddition to the specific memories recalled in his testimony.\n\n      {¶ 49} While more general in nature, Counts 3 and 13 were supported by distinct\n\ntestimony from the other counts alleged in 1999 and 2006. Like the victim in Morgan, E.Z.\n\nplaced the repeated instances of abuse in context within a specified time frame and the\n\nhomes in which he resided. In so doing, E.Z. recounted numerous accounts of sexual abuse\n\nand locations where the abuse occurred.        E.Z.'s testimony was not merely general,\n\nambiguous claims of abuse. Accordingly, we find Counts 3 and 13 were supported by\n\nsufficient evidence and were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n                                         Count 15\n\n      {¶ 50} We find Count 15 must be vacated because there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport Workman's conviction for the offense charged. Count 15 relates to an instance of\n\nsexual abuse in which Workman allegedly showed E.Z. gay pornography prior to engaging in\n\nanal sex.\n\n      {¶ 51} Though maintaining that there was ample evidence to demonstrate additional\n\ncounts of rape, the state concedes that there wasn't any evidence of anal rape occurring in\n\nconjunction with the viewing of gay pornography.\n\n      {¶ 52} The only references to the gay pornography incident occurred during an\n\nexplanatory sidebar in which the state explained that Count 15 involved an incident where\n\nWorkman engaged in anal sex with E.Z. while forcing him to watch gay pornography. The\n                                            - 16 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\nstate also referenced the \"gay pornography\" count in its closing argument. However, in\n\nreviewing the testimony, there is no reference to an incident where Workman engaged in\n\nanal sex with E.Z. while forcing him to watch gay pornography.\n\n       {¶ 53} In its questioning of E.Z. with respect to the sexual abuse, the state was largely\n\nmethodical in following the indictment and eliciting the victim's testimony as to each triggering\n\nevent. However, it appears the state mistakenly jumped from Count 14 to Count 16 without\n\neliciting any testimony as to the alleged episode of sexual abuse involving the gay\n\npornography. Because there was no evidence as to Count 15, his conviction was not\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence.\n\n       {¶ 54} Based on our review of Workman's assignment of error, we conclude that his\n\nargument is sustained in part, and overruled in part. Workman's conviction and sentence for\n\nrape in Count 15 is based on insufficient evidence and must be vacated. The remaining\n\ncounts that Workman challenges in this assignment of error are without merit and hereby\n\noverruled.\n\n       {¶ 55} Assignment of Error No. 4:\n\n       {¶ 56} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S RULE 29 MOTION\n\nFOR ACQUITTAL AS VENUE ON COUNTS 1-6 HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND\n\nA REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\n       {¶ 57} In his fourth assignment of error, Workman argues that the trial court should\n\nhave granted his Crim.R. 29 motion with respect to Counts 1 through 6 because the offenses\n\noccurred in Hamilton County and therefore venue in Clermont County was improper. We find\n\nno merit to Workman's argument.\n\n       {¶ 58} \"Venue commonly refers to the appropriate place of trial for a criminal\n\nprosecution within a state.\" State v. Meridy, 12th Dist. Clermont. No. CA2003-11-091, 2005-\n\nOhio-241, ¶ 12. The importance of venue is to give the defendant the right to be tried in the\n                                              - 17 -\n\f                                                                      Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                               CA2016-12-083\n\nvicinity of his alleged criminal activity. Meridy at ¶ 12. The standard to establish venue is\n\nwhether appellant has a \"significant nexus\" with the county where the trial was held. Id. at ¶\n\n22; State v. Stone, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2007-11-132, 2008-Ohio-5671, ¶ 16. As a\n\nresult, and pursuant to R.C. 2901.12, Ohio's venue statute, \"[t]he trial of a criminal case in\n\nthis state shall be held in a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and in the territory\n\nof which the offense or any element of the offense was committed.\" R.C. 2901.12(A).\n\n       {¶ 59} We find Workman's argument is without merit. Although Workman is correct\n\nthat venue lies in any jurisdiction in which the offense or any element of the offense was\n\ncommitted, Ohio's venue statute, R.C. 2901.12, further provides that when an offender\n\ncommits offenses in different jurisdictions as part of a course of criminal conduct, venue lies\n\nfor all the offenses in any jurisdiction in which the offender committed one of the offenses or\n\nany element of one of those offenses. R.C. 2901.12(A), (H).\n\n       {¶ 60} The state proved a continuing course of conduct involving the sex offenses\n\ncommitted against E.Z. The state demonstrated in Counts 9 through 17 that Workman\n\nsexually abused E.Z. from 2006 until 2008 in Clermont County. The state also proved that\n\nthis pattern of abuse had occurred continuously since 1999 when E.Z. was living with\n\nWorkman in Hamilton County. As a result, we find that venue was appropriate in Clermont\n\nCounty for all offenses. Workman's fourth assignment of error is without merit and hereby\n\noverruled.\n\n       {¶ 61} Assignment of Error No. 5:\n\n       {¶ 62} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S RULE 29 MOTION\n\nFOR ACQUITTAL AS THE ELEMENT OF FORCE TO COUNTS 9-17 HAD NOT BEEN\n\nESTABLISHED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\n       {¶ 63} In his fifth assignment of error, Workman argues that the state failed to prove\n\nthe element of force related to Counts 9 through 17 for rape. We disagree.\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\n       {¶ 64} Pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), \"[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct\n\nwith another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or\n\nthreat of force.\"\n\n       {¶ 65} The Revised Code defines \"force\" as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint\n\nphysically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A).\n\n\"However, the definition of 'force' changes when the victim is a child, accounting for the fact\n\nthat adults can compel children to submit to sexual conduct by means of psychological\n\ncoercion or use of authority over the child.\" State v.

CA2014-\n\n03-005 and CA2014-03-006, 2015-Ohio-723, ¶ 20.\n\n       {¶ 66} This court has specifically recognized that \"force\" \"need not be overt and\n\nphysically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological.\" State v.

A child's will can be overcome by fear and\n\nduress when an important authority figure tells the child to do something, and commands the\n\nchild not to tell anyone about it. State v. Dehner, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-12-090,\n\n2013-Ohio-3576, ¶ 19. When the state proves that the child's will was overcome by fear or\n\nduress, the element of force is established. State v. Neal, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2016-\n\n06-033, 2017-Ohio-1493, ¶ 17.\n\n       {¶ 67} We find that Workman's argument with regard to the \"force\" requirement is\n\nwithout merit. The state presented ample evidence of force, as it showed that E.Z.'s will had\n\nbeen overcome by fear and duress. Workman was an authority figure in the residence and\n\nE.Z. was subject to his control. As described by E.Z., Workman maintained an emotionally\n\nabusive relationship with the family, often threatening to break up the family, and engaging in\n\nlengthy tirades with the family.\n\n       {¶ 68} E.Z. testified that Workman would threaten him if he refused to engage in\n\nsexual activities. These threats included breaking up the family, throwing E.Z.'s mother from\n                                             - 19 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\nthe residence, and physical threats. E.Z. stated that Workman threatened to hurt him if he\n\never told anyone about the abuse. In addition, E.Z. testified that even after the sexual abuse\n\nstopped, he still refrained from telling anyone out of concern for what Workman would do to\n\nhis family. E.Z. explained that the reason he finally came forward with the abuse allegations\n\nwas because he learned that Workman had been arrested for another sex crime.\n\n       {¶ 69} Based on our review, we find there was ample evidence to meet the definition\n\nof \"force.\" The evidence presented shows a disturbing use of physical and psychological\n\nharm that was employed continuously over the years. As such, Workman's argument to the\n\ncontrary is without merit and his fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 70} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n\n       {¶ 71} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE STATE OF OHIO'S\n\nMOTION TO CONSOLIDATE THE TWO INDICTMENTS.\n\n       {¶ 72} In his third assignment of error, Workman argues that the trial court error by\n\npermitting the joinder of unrelated offenses. We find no merit to Workman's argument.\n\n       {¶ 73} The law favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial under Crim.R. 8(A) if\n\nthe offenses charged are of the same or similar character. State v. Wilkins, 12th Dist. Clinton\n\nNo. CA2007-03-007, 2008-Ohio-2739, ¶ 13. Under Crim.R. 13, a \"trial court may order two\n\nor more indictments or information or both to be tried together, if the offenses * * * could have\n\nbeen joined in a single indictment or information.\" Id. \"However, a defendant is allowed,\n\nunder Crim.R. 14, to move to sever offenses that have otherwise been properly joined where\n\nit appears that joinder would be prejudicial.\" State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-11-\n\n214, 2012-Ohio-5607, ¶ 12.\n\n       {¶ 74} The decision to grant or deny a motion to sever is a matter in the trial court's\n\ndiscretion, and therefore, we review the trial court's decision under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard. State v. Matthews, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-09-175, 2013-Ohio-3482, ¶ 35.\n                                              - 20 -\n\f                                                                      Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                               CA2016-12-083\n\n\"An abuse of discretion implies that the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or\n\nunconscionable.\" Rose at ¶ 11.\n\n       {¶ 75} To prevail on a claim that the trial court erred in denying a motion to sever, the\n\nappellant must affirmatively demonstrate: \"(1) his rights were prejudiced, (2) he provided the\n\ntrial court with sufficient information enabling it to weigh the consideration favoring joinder\n\nagainst the defendant's right to a fair trial, and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to separate the charges for trial.\" Id. at ¶ 13; Matthews at ¶ 37.\n\n       {¶ 76} \"The state may negate a claim of prejudice in one of two ways.\" Rose at ¶ 14.\n\n\"The first is through the 'other acts' test, where the 'state must demonstrate it could have\n\nintroduced evidence of the joined offenses at separate trials, pursuant to the 'other acts'\n\nprovision of Evid.R. 404(B).'\" Id., citing State v. Lott, 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163 (1990).\n\n\"Alternatively, under the 'joinder test' the state can refute a claim of prejudice by showing 'that\n\nevidence of each crime joined at trial is simple and direct.'\" Id., citing State v. Moshos, 12th\n\nDist. Clinton No. CA2009-06-008, 2010-Ohio-735, ¶ 79. If the state can establish that the\n\nevidence is \"simple and direct,\" then there is no need to meet the more strict \"other acts\"\n\ntest. Id. In other words, a demonstration by the state \"that the evidence relating to each\n\ncrime is simple and direct negates any claims of prejudice and renders joinder proper.\"\n\nMoshos at ¶ 80.\n\n       {¶ 77} In this case, the trial court determined that the evidence relative to each count\n\nof the indictment was simple and direct and that Workman failed to meet his burden of\n\ndemonstrating that joinder of these counts is prejudicial. We find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe trial court's determination.\n\n       {¶ 78} \"Ohio appellate courts have upheld joinder in sex abuse cases involving\n\nmultiple child victims where the evidence as to each offense is separate, uncomplicated and\n\nsufficient to support a conviction without necessitating the use of evidence relating to other\n                                               - 21 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\noffenses.\" State v. Ashcraft, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2008-12-305, 2009-Ohio-5281, ¶ 19;\n\nMatthews, 2013-Ohio-3482 at ¶ 40.\n\n       {¶ 79} The record demonstrates that during its opening statement, the state\n\npresented an organized overview of the facts as to each offense and each victim. The state\n\nthen presented its case involving R.C. Following the conclusion of the evidence on those\n\ncounts, the state then proceeded to prosecute its case concerning sexual abuse involving\n\nE.Z. During closing argument, the state again argued both cases separately.\n\n       {¶ 80} The record also demonstrates that sufficient evidence was presented as to\n\neach offense without necessitating the use of evidence from one occurrence to prove the\n\nother. As detailed above, both R.C. and E.Z. provided testimony concerning the alleged acts\n\nof sexual abuse Workman committed against them, including the circumstances under which\n\nthe abuse occurred. The record shows that the evidence pertaining to each victim and each\n\noffense could be easily segregated. Furthermore, there is no indication in the record how\n\nWorkman would have defended the charges differently had they been tried separately. See\n\nState v. Ashcroft, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2008-12-305, 2009-Ohio-5281, ¶ 25. Finally, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that the trial judge instructed the jury that it was required to consider the\n\ncharges as separate matters.        See id.; Vunda, 2014-Ohio-3449 at ¶ 73 (there is a\n\npresumption that jurors follow the instructions given by the trial court).\n\n       {¶ 81} Because of the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in denying\n\nWorkman's request for severance where the evidence concerning each offense was separate\n\nand distinct, and simple and direct. The matters for the jury were simple and revolved around\n\nwitness credibility and whether Workman had engaged in the alleged sexual conduct.\n\nWorkman's third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 82} Assignment of Error No. 6:\n\n       {¶ 83} THE CONSECUTIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL COURT'S 161 YEAR\n                                              - 22 -\n\f                                                                  Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                           CA2016-12-083\n\nSENTENCE IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE DANGER APPELLANT POSES TO THE\n\nPUBLIC.\n\n      {¶ 84} In his sixth assignment of error, Workman alleges the trial court erred by\n\nimposing a 161-year prison sentence. Though Workman concedes that the trial court made\n\nthe necessary consecutive sentencing findings, he argues that the sentence was\n\ndisproportionate and excessive and also not necessary to protect the public.\n\n      {¶ 85} Workman received a 10-year prison sentence on each of 15 counts of rape\n\ncommitted against E.Z. for violations of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(a), and\n\nR.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which were first-degree felonies. Each sentence was ordered to be\n\nserved consecutively for a total of 150 years in prison. In addition, Workman was sentenced\n\nto an 11-year prison sentence for his rape conviction committed against R.C. in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.02(A)(2). The trial court ordered that sentence be served consecutive to the 150-\n\nyear prison term imposed for a total of 161 years.\n\n      {¶ 86} As noted above, Workman's conviction on Count 15 involving E.Z. is not\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence and is vacated as is its corresponding sentence. However,\n\nwe will review the remaining convictions, which are supported by the weight of the evidence.\n\n      {¶ 87} This court reviews felony sentences pursuant to the standard of review set\n\nforth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) to determine whether the imposition of those sentences is clearly\n\nand convincingly contrary to law. State v. Julious, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-12-224,\n\n2016-Ohio-4822, ¶ 8. Pursuant to that statute, an appellate court may modify or vacate a\n\nsentence only if, by clear and convincing evidence, \"the record does not support the trial\n\ncourt's findings under relevant statutes or that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n\nState v.

State v. Dillon,\n\n12th Dist. Madison No. CA2012-06-012, 2013-Ohio-335, ¶ 9. First, the trial court must find\n\nthat consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish\n\nthe offender. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). Id. Second, the trial court must find that consecutive\n\nsentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the\n\ndanger the offender poses to the public. Id. Third, the trial court must find that one of the\n\nfollowing applies:\n\n              (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses\n              while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a\n              sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or\n              2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control\n              for a prior offense.\n\n              (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part\n              of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two\n              or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or\n              unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses\n              committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately\n              reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\n\n              (c) The offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that\n              consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from\n              future crime by the offender.\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a)-(c).\n\n       {¶ 89} \"A trial court satisfies the statutory requirement of making the required findings\n\nwhen the record reflects that the court engaged in the required analysis and selected the\n\nappropriate statutory criteria.\" State v. Setty, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2013-06-049 and\n\nCA2013-06-050, 2014-Ohio-2340, ¶ 113. In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court\n\n\n                                             - 24 -\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\nis not required to provide a word-for-word recitation of the language of the statute or\n\narticulate reasons supporting its findings. Id. Nevertheless, the record must reflect that the\n\ntrial court engaged in the required sentencing analysis and made the requisite findings. Id.\n\nThe court's findings must thereafter be incorporated into its sentencing entry. State v. Ahlers,\n\n12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-06-100, 2016-Ohio-2890, ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶ 90} Here, the record reflects that the trial court made the findings required by R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4) when it ordered Workman's sentences be served consecutively. The trial\n\ncourt noted the seriousness of the charges. Workman took advantage of R.C. through a\n\nprior relationship and committed a sexual offense on the child while he was asleep. When\n\nWorkman was exposed for his conduct, E.Z. came forward and disclosed a nearly decade-\n\nlong pattern of repeated sexual abuse. The trial court found that Workman's conduct was\n\nmore serious than normally constituting the offenses of rape and that consecutive sentences\n\nwere necessary to protect the public from future crimes.\n\n       {¶ 91} The trial court later memorialized these findings within its sentencing entry.\n\nFrom the trial court's statements at the sentencing hearing and the language used in the\n\nsentencing entry, it is clear that the trial court complied with the dictates of R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4). See State v. Bonnell, 140 Ohio St.3d 209, 2014-Ohio-3177, ¶ 37; State v.\n\nSess, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-06-117, 2016-Ohio-5560, ¶ 35-38. It is also clear that\n\nthe record supports the trial court's findings that the harm caused by Workman's offenses\n\nwas so great or unusual that no single prison term adequately reflected the seriousness of\n\nhis conduct and that consecutive sentences were necessary to punish Workman and protect\n\nthe public.\n\n       {¶ 92} Workman argues that he had \"led an otherwise law-abiding life\" until the\n\npresent charges. That argument is completely unpersuasive. The evidence shows that\n\nWorkman was a violent sexual offender who engaged in a nearly decade long pattern of\n                                             - 25 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\nabuse with a child. Workman committed the abuse and then threatened the child to prevent\n\ndisclosure of the abuse. Workman was only caught when he sexually abused another child.\n\nThe statement that Workman otherwise led a \"law-abiding life\" is stunningly rebutted by the\n\nrecord.\n\n       {¶ 93} Since we have vacated Workman's conviction and sentence on Count 15, we\n\nhereby reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the matter for resentencing consistent\n\nwith this Opinion. In all other respects, the trial court's judgment on the remaining convictions\n\nis affirmed.\n\n       {¶ 94} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n       PIPER and M. POWELL, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\f",

Stephen Haynes, Clermont County Public Defender, Robert F. Benintendi, 302 East Main\nStreet, Batavia, Ohio 45103, for defendant-appellant\n\n\n\n        RINGLAND, J.\n\n        {¶ 1} Defendant-appellant, Michael Workman, appeals his conviction and sentence in\n\nthe Clermont County Court of Common Pleas for multiple sexual offenses. For the reasons\n\ndetailed below, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand this matter to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n        {¶ 2} This is a consolidated case involving two victims of Workman's sexual abuse.\n\nThe first case involved allegations of sexual abuse committed against R.C., a 13-year-old\n\f                                                                           Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                                    CA2016-12-083\n\nfriend of Workman's stepson. Following the disclosure of this incident, another victim, E.Z.,\n\ncame forward with allegations that Workman had repeatedly sexually abused him for nearly a\n\ndecade.\n\n       {¶ 3} Workman was indicted on February 11, 2016 for two counts of rape in violation\n\nof R.C. 2907.02 and two counts of gross sexual imposition in violation of R.C. 2907.05 for the\n\nsexual abuse committed against R.C. Thereafter, on March 24, 2016, Workman was indicted\n\nfor the sexual abuse committed against E.Z. The indictment listed 17 counts. Counts 1-6\n\nwere for rapes occurring in Hamilton County between 1999 and 2000.1 Counts 7-8 were for\n\ndrug offenses between May 1, 2007 and September 1, 2007 where Workman had allegedly\n\nprovided E.Z. with drugs to sedate him. Counts 9-10 were rape charges during the same\n\nMay 1, 2007 to September 1, 2007 time frame alleging that Workman used drugs to sedate\n\nE.Z. in order to facilitate sexual abuse. Counts 11-17 were for rapes occurring in Clermont\n\nCounty between 2006 and 2008.\n\n       {¶ 4} The trial court granted the state's motion to consolidate the two cases and the\n\nmatter was tried to a jury.\n\n                                                  R.C.\n\n       {¶ 5} R.C. testified that on November 15, 2015, he was in Workman's bedroom\n\nplaying video games with Workman's stepson. Workman was also in the bedroom playing a\n\ncomputer video game. R.C. stated that at some point he became tired and fell asleep on\n\nWorkman's bed.\n\n       {¶ 6} When he awoke, R.C. stated that Workman was performing oral sex on him.\n\nThough he fell asleep fully clothed, R.C. testified that his pants and underwear had been\n\npulled down and Workman's mouth was on his penis. R.C. stated that Workman stopped\n\n\n1. E.Z. was under the age of 13 for Counts 1-6. For Counts 7-11, the state sought to prove that the sexual\nconduct occurred by force or threat of force.\n\n                                                   -2-\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\nperforming oral sex on him when he awoke and began moving. R.C. explained that\n\nWorkman let go of him and shifted to make it look like he was playing his video game. R.C.\n\nthen left the room.\n\n       {¶ 7} R.C.'s family testified that R.C. returned home distraught. R.C.'s grandmother\n\ntestified that R.C. came home, sat in a rocking chair, acted very nervous, and pulled his\n\nsweatshirt over his head while sobbing. R.C. did not initially disclose what had occurred, but\n\nwhen asked whether someone had hurt him, he responded \"it's worse than that.\" R.C.\n\ncontinued to cry, but would not disclose the abuse. R.C. stated only that it was \"disgusting.\"\n\n       {¶ 8} The family was eventually able to persuade R.C. to disclose the abuse to his\n\naunt. After the disclosure, R.C. was taken to the hospital where a rape kit examination was\n\nperformed and R.C. was interviewed by social workers at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.\n\nDNA analysis revealed the presence of amylase, an enzyme found in saliva, on R.C.'s\n\nunderwear. Further analysis revealed that Workman could not be excluded as a source for\n\nthe DNA and that only one in nearly 50,000 people would match the DNA found in R.C.'s\n\nunderwear. Additionally, the swab taken from R.C.'s penis revealed the presence of amylase\n\nand Workman could not be excluded as a source. Only one in 90,000 individuals would\n\nmatch the DNA found on R.C.'s penis.\n\n                                            E.Z.\n\n       {¶ 9} Following the evidence of abuse pertaining to R.C., the state shifted its case to\n\nthe abuse committed against E.Z.\n\n       {¶ 10} The state presented evidence that Workman had a familial relationship with\n\nthe victim's family. Workman lived with the victim at three separate residences: (1) a\n\nresidence in Hamilton County, Ohio between 1999-2000, (2) a residence in Florida between\n\n\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\f                                                                          Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                                   CA2016-12-083\n\n2000-2006, and (3) a residence in Clermont County from 2006 onward.2\n\n         {¶ 11} E.Z. testified about the first instance of sexual abuse occurring in Hamilton\n\nCounty and several incidents that occurred prior to the family moving to Florida. The sexual\n\nabuse continued throughout the time they resided in Florida and when they returned to Ohio\n\nin 2006. At trial, E.Z. recounted various incidents of sexual abuse occurring in Clermont\n\nCounty, including incidents in which Workman used controlled substances in the commission\n\nof the abuse. The sexual activity stopped in 2008 when E.Z. forcefully ended the abuse and\n\nthreatened to report him.\n\n                                               Verdict\n\n         {¶ 12} Prior to deliberation, the trial court granted a Crim.R. 29 motion for Counts 7\n\nand 8 of the indictment in E.Z.'s case for corrupting another with drugs.               Following\n\ndeliberations, the jury found Workman guilty of all four Counts against R.C. and the\n\nremaining 15 Counts against E.Z. The trial court merged all four Counts involving R.C. and\n\nordered Workman to serve an 11-year prison term for that Count of rape. The 15 rape\n\nCounts involving E.Z. were not merged and the trial court ordered ten years for each\n\nconviction. All sentences were ordered consecutively for a total stated prison term of 161\n\nyears. Workman now appeals the decision of the trial court, raising five assignments of error\n\nfor review. For ease of discussion, Workman's assignments of error will be addressed out of\n\norder.\n\n         {¶ 13} Assignment of Error No. 1:\n\n         {¶ 14} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S RULE 29 MOTION\n\nAS THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED WAS INSUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE THAT GUILT HAD\n\nBEEN PROVEN BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\n\n\n2. These was some confusion as to the precise dates when the family moved to Florida.\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\n      {¶ 15} Assignment of Error No. 2:\n\n      {¶ 16} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ENTERING A FINDING OF GUILTY\n\nBECAUSE SUCH VERDICT WAS AGAINST THE MANIFEST WEIGHT OF THE\n\nEVIDENCE.\n\n      {¶ 17} Workman's first and second assignments of error relate to Counts 3, 6, 10, 13,\n\n15, and 16. Each Count was for rape against E.Z. Workman argues that his convictions are\n\nnot supported by sufficient evidence and are against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\nWe will address each argument below.\n\n      {¶ 18} Rape is defined in R.C. 2907.02, which provides:\n\n             (1) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another who\n             is not the spouse of the offender or who is the spouse of the\n             offender but is living separate and apart from the offender, when\n             any of the following applies:\n\n             (a) For the purpose of preventing resistance, the offender\n             substantially impairs the other person’s judgment or control by\n             administering any drug, intoxicant, or controlled substance to the\n             other person surreptitiously or by force, threat of force, or\n             deception.\n\n             (b) The other person is less than thirteen years of age, whether\n             or not the offender knows the age of the other person.\n\n             (c) The other person’s ability to resist or consent is substantially\n             impaired because of a mental or physical condition or because of\n             advanced age, and the offender knows or has reasonable cause\n             to believe that the other person’s ability to resist or consent is\n             substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition\n             or because of advanced age.\n\n             (2) No person shall engage in sexual conduct with another when\n             the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by\n             force or threat of force.\n\n      {¶ 19} Crim.R. 29(A) provides that \"[t]he court on motion of a defendant or on its own\n\nmotion, after the evidence on either side is closed, shall order the entry of a judgment of\n\nacquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such offense or\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\noffenses.\" An appellate court reviews the denial of a Crim.R. 29(A) motion pursuant to the\n\nsame standard as that used to review a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim. State v. Mota,\n\n12th Dist. Warren No. CA2007-06-082, 2008-Ohio-4163, ¶ 5.\n\n        {¶ 20} When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal\n\nconviction, an appellate court examines the evidence in order to determine whether such\n\nevidence, if believed, would support a conviction. State v. Boles, 12th Dist. Brown No.\n\nCA2012-06-012, 2013-Ohio-5202, ¶ 34. The relevant inquiry is \"whether, after viewing the\n\nevidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\n\nfound the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\" State v.\n\nWatson, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2014-08-110, 2015-Ohio-2321, ¶ 22. In other words, the\n\ntest for sufficiency requires a determination as to whether the state has met its burden of\n\nproduction at trial. State v. Wilson, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2006-01-007, 2007-Ohio-2298,\n\n¶ 34.\n\n        {¶ 21} A manifest weight challenge concerns the inclination of the greater amount of\n\ncredible evidence, offered in a trial, to support one side of the issue rather than the other.\n\nState v. Vunda, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-07-130 and CA2013-07-113, 2014-Ohio-3449,\n\n¶ 34. In assessing whether a conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence, a\n\nreviewing court examines the entire record, weighs the evidence and all reasonable\n\ninferences, considers the credibility of the witnesses, and determines whether, in resolving\n\nconflicts in the evidence, the trier of fact clearly lost its way and created such a manifest\n\nmiscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.

Hart, 12th Dist. Brown No. CA2011-03-008, 2012-Ohio-1896, ¶ 43.\n\n      {¶ 23} As previously noted, E.Z. testified about the sexual abuse he suffered at the\n\nhands of Workman. E.Z. testified that the sexual abuse began when Workman performed\n\noral sex on him when he was six or seven years old in his bedroom at the Hamilton County\n\nresidence. E.Z. described the sexual abuse as occurring frequently.\n\n      {¶ 24} After a while, but while E.Z. was still six or seven years old, Workman began\n\nperforming anal sex on E.Z. The typical instance of sexual abuse was explained by E.Z.:\n\n             Q. How – how many times, you know, when you're 6 or 7 years\n             old, how often did – did that type of conduct take place?\n\n             A. It was mostly every time after he finished anything orally on\n             me.\n             Q. So would he do something oral on you first?\n             A. Yes.\n             Q. Did he say anything to you after that type of conduct?\n             A. After the – after the unwarranted anal sex?\n             Q. I guess he would perform oral sex on you?\n             A. Yes.\n             Q. And then perform anal sex on you?\n             A. Yes, he would – he would tell me to roll over and – and yes.\n             Q. Do you remember where, or do you recall even when the\n             first time that happened?\n             A. I believe I was in his – well, I mean, at the time it would have\n             been him and my mom's bedroom, but – but it was in the\n             bedroom when we still lived on Roe Street. And – and he had, I\n             mean, he was trying to get me to fall asleep. And I mean, I – I\n             couldn't, because you know, as a kid I wanted to do other things.\n             And – and then that's when he just – he – he was trying to\n\n                                             -7-\n\f                                                                  Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                           CA2016-12-083\n\n              convince me that what he was doing for me, I needed to give him\n              something in return. And that's when he would perform the anal\n              sex.\n              Q. You said it hurt?\n              A. Very much so.\n              Q. Did you cry?\n              A. Yes, many times.\n        {¶ 25} Though the victim stated that the abuse occurred constantly over the period of\n\nnearly a decade, there were specific instances of abuse that triggered E.Z.'s memory.

However, as addressed in more detail below, the state\n\nappears to have inadvertently skipped over one instance set forth in the indictment and bill of\n\nparticulars.\n\n       {¶ 27} Following a thorough review of the evidence, we find the state presented\n\nsufficient evidence to sustain the majority of Workman's convictions and those convictions\n\nwere not against the manifest weight of the evidence. However, we agree that one offense\n\nwas not proven with any degree of specificity and must be vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -9-\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\n                         Counts 3, 6, 10, 13, and 16 are affirmed\n\n       {¶ 28} For the following Counts, we find the state's evidence is supported by the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence and therefore are also sustained by sufficient evidence.\n\n                                           Count 6\n\n       {¶ 29} Count 6 involved an allegation that Workman had anal sex with E.Z. in the\n\nbathroom of the Hamilton County residence in 2000. The state began by asking E.Z. if anal\n\nsex had occurred in different areas of the house. E.Z. replied in the affirmative and stated\n\nthat it had occurred in his room a few times, in the living room a few times, and in his\n\nbrother's room. The state then inquired if anything had happened in the bathroom, to which\n\nE.Z. responded affirmatively. E.Z. testified that it was following this bathroom incident that\n\nWorkman had told him that the entire situation was his fault, that E.Z. had started it, and that\n\nE.Z. had asked him to \"do those things.\"\n\n       {¶ 30} Workman argues that Count 6 is based on insufficient evidence because \"E.Z.\n\nnever described any sexual conduct occurring in the bathroom.\" Because E.Z. failed to\n\nelaborate, Workman contends that \"[w]e shall never know\" what exactly occurred in the\n\nbathroom. Workman suggests that perhaps a third party might have attempted to use the\n\nbathroom, thereby disrupting the act.\n\n       {¶ 31} When taken into appropriate context, however, the record reveals that\n\nWorkman's Count 6 conviction was based on sufficient evidence and was not against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. In this case, the state was focused on identifying prior\n\ninstances of anal sex and where that activity occurred in the Hamilton County residence.\n\nE.Z. affirmed that \"something\" happened with Workman in the bathroom and went on to\n\nexplain that it was following this incident that Workman began blaming the victim and\n\nasserting that the victim asked him to \"do those things.\" Previously, the victim had also\n\ntestified that Workman had tried to blame him as the reason why the sexual abuse occurred.\n                                             - 10 -\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\n       {¶ 32} Following review, we find the jury could well have inferred that the \"something\"\n\nthat occurred in the bathroom was anal sex, which would be appropriate given the context of\n\nthe testimony. As a result, we find Workman's conviction for Count 6 involving anal sex\n\noccurring in the Hamilton County residence was not against the manifest weight of the\n\nevidence.\n\n                                           Count 10\n\n       {¶ 33} Counts 9 and 10 involve instances in which Workman used a sedative to\n\nfacilitate two separate instances of sexual abuse. Workman does not challenge Count 9 in\n\nthis assignment of error. As to Count 10, the state presented the following testimony:\n\n              Q. And now [E.Z.], were there ever any times where the\n              Defendant gave you any substance –\n\n              A. Yes.\n              Q. – to kind of do some of these acts?\n              A. Yes. There were two specific times that I could remember\n              that I know of. And honestly, I mean, thinking back on it there\n              may have been times that he could have put it in my food,\n              because I just * * *. There were two times that he did. There\n              was one time that he gave it to me, and then later that night I fell\n              asleep. It was for – it was because I – I said something about\n              feeling sick or something like that, or I had a headache, and he\n              gave that to me. And then I woke up and he was on top of me,\n              again performing anal sex on me. And I tried to roll over to push\n              him off of me, but because of the medication I was too weak to\n              do so. And then there was another time that he kept telling me\n              to take it, so then I wouldn't remember what happened during.\n              And again, this was when I was older. So then I wouldn't be able\n              to, I guess, fight back as much. But I was still under mental\n              manipulation to not actually tell him no and mean it.\n       {¶ 34} Reviewing E.Z.'s testimony shows that E.Z. was referring to two specific\n\ninstances of sexual abuse: (1) a time when Workman gave E.Z. a drug, E.Z. fell asleep, and\n\nE.Z. woke up to Workman having anal sex with him, and (2) a time when Workman made\n\nE.Z. take a drug to forget the incident.\n\n                                             - 11 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\n       {¶ 35} After review, we find Count 10 is supported by sufficient testimony and is not\n\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Here, E.Z. testified about a specific scenario\n\nwherein Workman had given him drugs in the context of describing anal sex. We believe that\n\na jury could properly infer that Workman had engaged in anal sex with E.Z. after an incident\n\nin which Workman kept insisting that E.Z. take medication \"so then I wouldn't remember what\n\nhappened during.\" The jury did not clearly lose its way in finding that Workman completed a\n\nsex act on E.Z. with the use of a drug. As a result, we find Workman's conviction for Count\n\n10 is supported by sufficient evidence and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n                                           Count 16\n\n       {¶ 36} Count 16 of the indictment involved an incident where Workman allegedly\n\nperformed oral sex on E.Z. in a closet while E.Z. was reading a comic book. E.Z. testified:\n\n              * * * I went into the closet, because that's where I normally kept\n              them all, and I just sat in there with the light on, and quietly read\n              my comic books to myself. And there was this one night that\n              [Workman] came in there, and he – he went to perform oral sex\n              while – on me while I was reading my – my comic book.\n\n       {¶ 37} Workman cites this language in his brief, focusing specifically on the victim's\n\ntestimony that Workman \"went to perform oral sex.\" Workman argues that the usage of the\n\nterm \"went to perform\" implies that Workman did not complete the sex act, but merely\n\nattempted to do so.\n\n       {¶ 38} However, again, we find Workman's argument is without merit. Workman's\n\nCount 16 conviction for rape is supported by sufficient evidence and is not against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Here, E.Z. testified at length about Workman's sexual\n\nabuse, including that Workman repeatedly performed oral sex on him. In this instance, E.Z.\n\nwas reading a comic book in his closet when Workman \"went to perform oral sex.\" Though\n\nE.Z. testified through the perspective of the event unfolding, it would be reasonable for the\n\n\n                                              - 12 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\njury to conclude that Workman completed the sex act. As a result, we find there was\n\nsufficient evidence from which a jury could infer that sexual conduct had occurred.\n\nTherefore, Count 16 is supported by sufficient evidence and his conviction is not against the\n\nmanifest weight of the evidence.\n\n                                     Counts 3 and 13\n\n       {¶ 39} We now address Counts 3 and 13. Though the state elicited the victim's\n\ntestimony as to \"triggering events\" to prove the majority of the offenses, there were some\n\noffenses that the state attempted to prove based on the frequency of which the sexual abuse\n\noccurred. Counts 3 and 13 were two such instances of general conduct pursued by the state\n\nbased on the alleged frequency of sexual abuse.\n\n       {¶ 40} Workman argues that his convictions on Counts 3 and 13 are not supported by\n\nsufficient evidence because E.Z. did not present any detail of specificity on those counts.\n\nHowever, it is well established that, \"[a] precise time and date of an alleged offense are not\n\nordinarily essential elements.\" State v. Blankenburg, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2010-03-063,\n\n2012-Ohio-1289, ¶ 43. In sexual abuse cases involving children, it may be impossible to\n\nprovide a specific date. State v. Vunda, 12th Dist. Butler Nos. CA2012-07-130, CA2013-07-\n\n113, 2014-Ohio-3449, ¶ 36. \"The problem is compounded where the accused and the victim\n\nare related or reside in the same household, situations which often facilitate an extended\n\nperiod of abuse. An allowance for reasonableness and inexactitude must be made for such\n\ncases.\" Id.\n\n       {¶ 41} In State v. Hemphill, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 85431, 2005-Ohio-3726, the\n\nEighth District Court of Appeals reversed some of the defendant's convictions for rape where\n\nthe victim merely testified to numerical estimates of the sexual conduct and provided no\n\ntestimony connected to \"individual, distinguishable incidents.\" Id. at ¶ 88. In that case, the\n\nonly testimony elicited as to several counts was through a numerical estimate:\n                                            - 13 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\n              Q. Do you – can you tell us as to whether or not he had vaginal\n              sex with you, intercourse with you, on at least 33 times?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. Would he – did he touch your breasts at least 33 times?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\nId. at ¶ 11-14. Relying on a case from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Eight District\n\nheld that the state had failed to adequately differentiate these counts and, with three\n\nexceptions, failed to subject each count to individual proof. Id. at ¶ 88, ¶ 112.\n\n       {¶ 42} In contrast, this court decided State v. Morgan, 12th Dist. Brown Nos. CA2009-\n\n07-029 and CA2009-08-033, 2010-Ohio-1720, in which we found sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport multiple rape convictions.\n\n       {¶ 43} In Morgan, the victim testified that the defendant began engaging in sexual\n\nconduct with her when she was five years old. Id. at ¶ 4. The defendant would play \"guess\n\nthe candy game\" with her, where defendant would blindfold the victim and place his penis\n\ninside her mouth. The victim testified that this conduct occurred \"twice a week\" while the\n\nfamily lived in Residence 1. Id. When the family moved to Residence 2, the victim testified\n\nthat the defendant began to have vaginal sex with her. Id. at ¶ 5. According to the victim, the\n\ndefendant had \"come in my room when I was sleeping, my mom was gone and stuck his\n\npenis in my vagina and do what he wanted to do.\" Id. at ¶ 23. The victim testified that the\n\nrape would last for approximately five minutes and occurred \"mainly five times a week.\" Id.\n\nThe victim testified that the intercourse became less frequent after the defendant was injured\n\nby a ladder. Id. Once the family moved to Residence 3, the conduct occurred \"maybe like\n\ntwice a week.\" Id. When the family moved to Residence 4, the victim stated that the\n\ndefendant would put his penis in her vagina \"three to four times a week.\" Id.\n\n       {¶ 44} In considering the victim's testimony, this court found that the victim \"placed\n\n                                             - 14 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\nthe repeated instances of abuse in context of her age, her year in school, and the homes in\n\nwhich she resided.\" Id. at ¶ 24. Therefore, the victim's testimony was not merely general,\n\nambiguous claims of abuse as in Hemphill.\n\n       {¶ 45} We find clear contrasts between the ambiguous, indistinguishable testimony in\n\nHemphill and the case at bar. In the present case, the victim testified of repeated instances\n\nof sexual abuse, including oral and anal sex. By his estimations, E.Z. noted that the abuse\n\noccurred \"once or twice\" a week while living in Hamilton County. E.Z. stated that Workman\n\nhad anal sex with him at the Hamilton County residence multiple times in his room, multiple\n\ntimes in the living room, as well as other instances in the living room and his brother's room.\n\nE.Z. stated that the only place he hadn't been anally abused in the Hamilton County\n\nresidence was in the kitchen and the hallway.\n\n       {¶ 46} Aside from the separate acts testified to in Counts 1 and 2, the state charged\n\nWorkman with one additional count of rape for Count 3. All of those Counts were alleged to\n\nhave occurred in 1999 while E.Z. lived in the Hamilton County residence. Based on the\n\nfrequency of abuse, it would be nearly impossible for E.Z. to remember specific details about\n\nevery single rape that occurred given that this conduct occurred innumerable times over a\n\nspan of nearly a decade. When the state is faced with a victim of continual sexual abuse\n\nwho does not have a distinct memory of details associated with numerous occasions, it is\n\nwithin the confines of due process to permit the state to charge the accused with at least one\n\ncriminal offense for a specific time period. See Vunda, 2014-Ohio-3449 ¶ 35-45.\n\n       {¶ 47} This matter is unlike Hemphill where the only testimony was a numerical\n\nestimate based on mere general, ambiguous claims of abuse. As to Count 3, E.Z. recalled\n\nthe frequency of the abuse, his age, multiple locations where the abuse occurred, and\n\ndistinct memories of abuse.\n\n       {¶ 48} Similarly, Count 13 involved a separate charge of anal rape that occurred in\n                                             - 15 -\n\f                                                                 Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                          CA2016-12-083\n\n2006 while the family lived in the Clermont County residence. Though E.Z. gave specific\n\ntestimony as to Count 12, which also occurred in 2006, E.Z. did not attach any specific\n\nmemory to any other instance of anal sex occurring in 2006. However, because of the\n\nfrequency of abuse, Count 13 was representative of an additional count of anal rape, which\n\noccurred in addition to the specific memory attached to Count 12. Again, E.Z. testified that\n\nWorkman had anal sex multiple times per year at the Clermont County residence, which is in\n\naddition to the specific memories recalled in his testimony.\n\n      {¶ 49} While more general in nature, Counts 3 and 13 were supported by distinct\n\ntestimony from the other counts alleged in 1999 and 2006. Like the victim in Morgan, E.Z.\n\nplaced the repeated instances of abuse in context within a specified time frame and the\n\nhomes in which he resided. In so doing, E.Z. recounted numerous accounts of sexual abuse\n\nand locations where the abuse occurred.        E.Z.'s testimony was not merely general,\n\nambiguous claims of abuse. Accordingly, we find Counts 3 and 13 were supported by\n\nsufficient evidence and were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\n                                         Count 15\n\n      {¶ 50} We find Count 15 must be vacated because there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport Workman's conviction for the offense charged. Count 15 relates to an instance of\n\nsexual abuse in which Workman allegedly showed E.Z. gay pornography prior to engaging in\n\nanal sex.\n\n      {¶ 51} Though maintaining that there was ample evidence to demonstrate additional\n\ncounts of rape, the state concedes that there wasn't any evidence of anal rape occurring in\n\nconjunction with the viewing of gay pornography.\n\n      {¶ 52} The only references to the gay pornography incident occurred during an\n\nexplanatory sidebar in which the state explained that Count 15 involved an incident where\n\nWorkman engaged in anal sex with E.Z. while forcing him to watch gay pornography. The\n                                            - 16 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\nstate also referenced the \"gay pornography\" count in its closing argument. However, in\n\nreviewing the testimony, there is no reference to an incident where Workman engaged in\n\nanal sex with E.Z. while forcing him to watch gay pornography.\n\n       {¶ 53} In its questioning of E.Z. with respect to the sexual abuse, the state was largely\n\nmethodical in following the indictment and eliciting the victim's testimony as to each triggering\n\nevent. However, it appears the state mistakenly jumped from Count 14 to Count 16 without\n\neliciting any testimony as to the alleged episode of sexual abuse involving the gay\n\npornography. Because there was no evidence as to Count 15, his conviction was not\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence.\n\n       {¶ 54} Based on our review of Workman's assignment of error, we conclude that his\n\nargument is sustained in part, and overruled in part. Workman's conviction and sentence for\n\nrape in Count 15 is based on insufficient evidence and must be vacated. The remaining\n\ncounts that Workman challenges in this assignment of error are without merit and hereby\n\noverruled.\n\n       {¶ 55} Assignment of Error No. 4:\n\n       {¶ 56} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S RULE 29 MOTION\n\nFOR ACQUITTAL AS VENUE ON COUNTS 1-6 HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND\n\nA REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\n       {¶ 57} In his fourth assignment of error, Workman argues that the trial court should\n\nhave granted his Crim.R. 29 motion with respect to Counts 1 through 6 because the offenses\n\noccurred in Hamilton County and therefore venue in Clermont County was improper. We find\n\nno merit to Workman's argument.\n\n       {¶ 58} \"Venue commonly refers to the appropriate place of trial for a criminal\n\nprosecution within a state.\" State v. Meridy, 12th Dist. Clermont. No. CA2003-11-091, 2005-\n\nOhio-241, ¶ 12. The importance of venue is to give the defendant the right to be tried in the\n                                              - 17 -\n\f                                                                      Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                               CA2016-12-083\n\nvicinity of his alleged criminal activity. Meridy at ¶ 12. The standard to establish venue is\n\nwhether appellant has a \"significant nexus\" with the county where the trial was held. Id. at ¶\n\n22; State v. Stone, 12th Dist. Warren No. CA2007-11-132, 2008-Ohio-5671, ¶ 16. As a\n\nresult, and pursuant to R.C. 2901.12, Ohio's venue statute, \"[t]he trial of a criminal case in\n\nthis state shall be held in a court having jurisdiction of the subject matter, and in the territory\n\nof which the offense or any element of the offense was committed.\" R.C. 2901.12(A).\n\n       {¶ 59} We find Workman's argument is without merit. Although Workman is correct\n\nthat venue lies in any jurisdiction in which the offense or any element of the offense was\n\ncommitted, Ohio's venue statute, R.C. 2901.12, further provides that when an offender\n\ncommits offenses in different jurisdictions as part of a course of criminal conduct, venue lies\n\nfor all the offenses in any jurisdiction in which the offender committed one of the offenses or\n\nany element of one of those offenses. R.C. 2901.12(A), (H).\n\n       {¶ 60} The state proved a continuing course of conduct involving the sex offenses\n\ncommitted against E.Z. The state demonstrated in Counts 9 through 17 that Workman\n\nsexually abused E.Z. from 2006 until 2008 in Clermont County. The state also proved that\n\nthis pattern of abuse had occurred continuously since 1999 when E.Z. was living with\n\nWorkman in Hamilton County. As a result, we find that venue was appropriate in Clermont\n\nCounty for all offenses. Workman's fourth assignment of error is without merit and hereby\n\noverruled.\n\n       {¶ 61} Assignment of Error No. 5:\n\n       {¶ 62} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT'S RULE 29 MOTION\n\nFOR ACQUITTAL AS THE ELEMENT OF FORCE TO COUNTS 9-17 HAD NOT BEEN\n\nESTABLISHED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.\n\n       {¶ 63} In his fifth assignment of error, Workman argues that the state failed to prove\n\nthe element of force related to Counts 9 through 17 for rape. We disagree.\n                                               - 18 -\n\f                                                                   Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                            CA2016-12-083\n\n       {¶ 64} Pursuant to R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), \"[n]o person shall engage in sexual conduct\n\nwith another when the offender purposely compels the other person to submit by force or\n\nthreat of force.\"\n\n       {¶ 65} The Revised Code defines \"force\" as \"any violence, compulsion, or constraint\n\nphysically exerted by any means upon or against a person or thing.\" R.C. 2901.01(A).\n\n\"However, the definition of 'force' changes when the victim is a child, accounting for the fact\n\nthat adults can compel children to submit to sexual conduct by means of psychological\n\ncoercion or use of authority over the child.\" State v. Grant, 12th Dist. Brown Nos. CA2014-\n\n03-005 and CA2014-03-006, 2015-Ohio-723, ¶ 20.\n\n       {¶ 66} This court has specifically recognized that \"force\" \"need not be overt and\n\nphysically brutal, but can be subtle and psychological.\" State v. Rankin, 12th Dist. Clinton\n\nNo. CA2004-06-015, 2005-Ohio-6165, ¶ 47. A child's will can be overcome by fear and\n\nduress when an important authority figure tells the child to do something, and commands the\n\nchild not to tell anyone about it. State v. Dehner, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2012-12-090,\n\n2013-Ohio-3576, ¶ 19. When the state proves that the child's will was overcome by fear or\n\nduress, the element of force is established. State v. Neal, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2016-\n\n06-033, 2017-Ohio-1493, ¶ 17.\n\n       {¶ 67} We find that Workman's argument with regard to the \"force\" requirement is\n\nwithout merit. The state presented ample evidence of force, as it showed that E.Z.'s will had\n\nbeen overcome by fear and duress. Workman was an authority figure in the residence and\n\nE.Z. was subject to his control. As described by E.Z., Workman maintained an emotionally\n\nabusive relationship with the family, often threatening to break up the family, and engaging in\n\nlengthy tirades with the family.\n\n       {¶ 68} E.Z. testified that Workman would threaten him if he refused to engage in\n\nsexual activities. These threats included breaking up the family, throwing E.Z.'s mother from\n                                             - 19 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\nthe residence, and physical threats. E.Z. stated that Workman threatened to hurt him if he\n\never told anyone about the abuse. In addition, E.Z. testified that even after the sexual abuse\n\nstopped, he still refrained from telling anyone out of concern for what Workman would do to\n\nhis family. E.Z. explained that the reason he finally came forward with the abuse allegations\n\nwas because he learned that Workman had been arrested for another sex crime.\n\n       {¶ 69} Based on our review, we find there was ample evidence to meet the definition\n\nof \"force.\" The evidence presented shows a disturbing use of physical and psychological\n\nharm that was employed continuously over the years. As such, Workman's argument to the\n\ncontrary is without merit and his fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 70} Assignment of Error No. 3:\n\n       {¶ 71} THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GRANTING THE STATE OF OHIO'S\n\nMOTION TO CONSOLIDATE THE TWO INDICTMENTS.\n\n       {¶ 72} In his third assignment of error, Workman argues that the trial court error by\n\npermitting the joinder of unrelated offenses. We find no merit to Workman's argument.\n\n       {¶ 73} The law favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial under Crim.R. 8(A) if\n\nthe offenses charged are of the same or similar character. State v. Wilkins, 12th Dist. Clinton\n\nNo. CA2007-03-007, 2008-Ohio-2739, ¶ 13. Under Crim.R. 13, a \"trial court may order two\n\nor more indictments or information or both to be tried together, if the offenses * * * could have\n\nbeen joined in a single indictment or information.\" Id. \"However, a defendant is allowed,\n\nunder Crim.R. 14, to move to sever offenses that have otherwise been properly joined where\n\nit appears that joinder would be prejudicial.\" State v. Rose, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2011-11-\n\n214, 2012-Ohio-5607, ¶ 12.\n\n       {¶ 74} The decision to grant or deny a motion to sever is a matter in the trial court's\n\ndiscretion, and therefore, we review the trial court's decision under an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard. State v. Matthews, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2012-09-175, 2013-Ohio-3482, ¶ 35.\n                                              - 20 -\n\f                                                                      Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                               CA2016-12-083\n\n\"An abuse of discretion implies that the trial court's decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or\n\nunconscionable.\" Rose at ¶ 11.\n\n       {¶ 75} To prevail on a claim that the trial court erred in denying a motion to sever, the\n\nappellant must affirmatively demonstrate: \"(1) his rights were prejudiced, (2) he provided the\n\ntrial court with sufficient information enabling it to weigh the consideration favoring joinder\n\nagainst the defendant's right to a fair trial, and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nrefusing to separate the charges for trial.\" Id. at ¶ 13; Matthews at ¶ 37.\n\n       {¶ 76} \"The state may negate a claim of prejudice in one of two ways.\" Rose at ¶ 14.\n\n\"The first is through the 'other acts' test, where the 'state must demonstrate it could have\n\nintroduced evidence of the joined offenses at separate trials, pursuant to the 'other acts'\n\nprovision of Evid.R. 404(B).'\" Id., citing State v.

In other words, a demonstration by the state \"that the evidence relating to each\n\ncrime is simple and direct negates any claims of prejudice and renders joinder proper.\"\n\nMoshos at ¶ 80.\n\n       {¶ 77} In this case, the trial court determined that the evidence relative to each count\n\nof the indictment was simple and direct and that Workman failed to meet his burden of\n\ndemonstrating that joinder of these counts is prejudicial. We find no abuse of discretion in\n\nthe trial court's determination.\n\n       {¶ 78} \"Ohio appellate courts have upheld joinder in sex abuse cases involving\n\nmultiple child victims where the evidence as to each offense is separate, uncomplicated and\n\nsufficient to support a conviction without necessitating the use of evidence relating to other\n                                               - 21 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\noffenses.\" State v. Ashcraft, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2008-12-305, 2009-Ohio-5281, ¶ 19;\n\nMatthews, 2013-Ohio-3482 at ¶ 40.\n\n       {¶ 79} The record demonstrates that during its opening statement, the state\n\npresented an organized overview of the facts as to each offense and each victim. The state\n\nthen presented its case involving R.C. Following the conclusion of the evidence on those\n\ncounts, the state then proceeded to prosecute its case concerning sexual abuse involving\n\nE.Z. During closing argument, the state again argued both cases separately.\n\n       {¶ 80} The record also demonstrates that sufficient evidence was presented as to\n\neach offense without necessitating the use of evidence from one occurrence to prove the\n\nother. As detailed above, both R.C. and E.Z. provided testimony concerning the alleged acts\n\nof sexual abuse Workman committed against them, including the circumstances under which\n\nthe abuse occurred. The record shows that the evidence pertaining to each victim and each\n\noffense could be easily segregated. Furthermore, there is no indication in the record how\n\nWorkman would have defended the charges differently had they been tried separately. See\n\nState v. Ashcroft, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2008-12-305, 2009-Ohio-5281, ¶ 25. Finally, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that the trial judge instructed the jury that it was required to consider the\n\ncharges as separate matters.        See id.; Vunda, 2014-Ohio-3449 at ¶ 73 (there is a\n\npresumption that jurors follow the instructions given by the trial court).\n\n       {¶ 81} Because of the foregoing, we find the trial court did not err in denying\n\nWorkman's request for severance where the evidence concerning each offense was separate\n\nand distinct, and simple and direct. The matters for the jury were simple and revolved around\n\nwitness credibility and whether Workman had engaged in the alleged sexual conduct.\n\nWorkman's third assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 82} Assignment of Error No. 6:\n\n       {¶ 83} THE CONSECUTIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL COURT'S 161 YEAR\n                                              - 22 -\n\f                                                                  Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                           CA2016-12-083\n\nSENTENCE IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE DANGER APPELLANT POSES TO THE\n\nPUBLIC.\n\n      {¶ 84} In his sixth assignment of error, Workman alleges the trial court erred by\n\nimposing a 161-year prison sentence. Though Workman concedes that the trial court made\n\nthe necessary consecutive sentencing findings, he argues that the sentence was\n\ndisproportionate and excessive and also not necessary to protect the public.\n\n      {¶ 85} Workman received a 10-year prison sentence on each of 15 counts of rape\n\ncommitted against E.Z. for violations of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(a), and\n\nR.C. 2907.02(A)(2), which were first-degree felonies. Each sentence was ordered to be\n\nserved consecutively for a total of 150 years in prison. In addition, Workman was sentenced\n\nto an 11-year prison sentence for his rape conviction committed against R.C. in violation of\n\nR.C. 2907.02(A)(2). The trial court ordered that sentence be served consecutive to the 150-\n\nyear prison term imposed for a total of 161 years.\n\n      {¶ 86} As noted above, Workman's conviction on Count 15 involving E.Z. is not\n\nsupported by sufficient evidence and is vacated as is its corresponding sentence. However,\n\nwe will review the remaining convictions, which are supported by the weight of the evidence.\n\n      {¶ 87} This court reviews felony sentences pursuant to the standard of review set\n\nforth in R.C. 2953.08(G)(2) to determine whether the imposition of those sentences is clearly\n\nand convincingly contrary to law. State v. Julious, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-12-224,\n\n2016-Ohio-4822, ¶ 8. Pursuant to that statute, an appellate court may modify or vacate a\n\nsentence only if, by clear and convincing evidence, \"the record does not support the trial\n\ncourt's findings under relevant statutes or that the sentence is otherwise contrary to law.\n\nState v. Harp, 12th Dist. Clermont No. CA2015-12-096, 2016-Ohio-4921, ¶ 7. A sentence is\n\nnot clearly and convincingly contrary to law where the trial court considers the purposes and\n\nprinciples of sentencing as set forth in R.C. 2929.11, as well as the seriousness and\n                                            - 23 -\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\nrecidivism factors listed in R.C. 2929.12, and sentences a defendant within the permissible\n\nstatutory range.

CA2014-10-201 and CA2014-\n\n10-202, 2016-Ohio-4918, ¶ 9.\n\n       {¶ 88} Pursuant to R.C. 2929.14(C)(4), a trial court must engage in a three-step\n\nanalysis and make certain findings before imposing consecutive sentences. State v. Dillon,\n\n12th Dist. Madison No. CA2012-06-012, 2013-Ohio-335, ¶ 9. First, the trial court must find\n\nthat consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from future crime or to punish\n\nthe offender. R.C. 2929.14(C)(4). Id. Second, the trial court must find that consecutive\n\nsentences are not disproportionate to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and to the\n\ndanger the offender poses to the public. Id. Third, the trial court must find that one of the\n\nfollowing applies:\n\n              (a) The offender committed one or more of the multiple offenses\n              while the offender was awaiting trial or sentencing, was under a\n              sanction imposed pursuant to section 2929.16, 2929.17, or\n              2929.18 of the Revised Code, or was under post-release control\n              for a prior offense.\n\n              (b) At least two of the multiple offenses were committed as part\n              of one or more courses of conduct, and the harm caused by two\n              or more of the multiple offenses so committed was so great or\n              unusual that no single prison term for any of the offenses\n              committed as part of any of the courses of conduct adequately\n              reflects the seriousness of the offender's conduct.\n\n              (c) The offender's history of criminal conduct demonstrates that\n              consecutive sentences are necessary to protect the public from\n              future crime by the offender.\n\nR.C. 2929.14(C)(4)(a)-(c).\n\n       {¶ 89} \"A trial court satisfies the statutory requirement of making the required findings\n\nwhen the record reflects that the court engaged in the required analysis and selected the\n\nappropriate statutory criteria.\" State v. Setty, 12th Dist. Clermont Nos. CA2013-06-049 and\n\nCA2013-06-050, 2014-Ohio-2340, ¶ 113. In imposing consecutive sentences, the trial court\n\n\n                                             - 24 -\n\f                                                                    Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                             CA2016-12-083\n\nis not required to provide a word-for-word recitation of the language of the statute or\n\narticulate reasons supporting its findings. Id. Nevertheless, the record must reflect that the\n\ntrial court engaged in the required sentencing analysis and made the requisite findings. Id.\n\nThe court's findings must thereafter be incorporated into its sentencing entry. State v. Ahlers,\n\n12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-06-100, 2016-Ohio-2890, ¶ 10.\n\n       {¶ 90} Here, the record reflects that the trial court made the findings required by R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4) when it ordered Workman's sentences be served consecutively. The trial\n\ncourt noted the seriousness of the charges. Workman took advantage of R.C. through a\n\nprior relationship and committed a sexual offense on the child while he was asleep. When\n\nWorkman was exposed for his conduct, E.Z. came forward and disclosed a nearly decade-\n\nlong pattern of repeated sexual abuse. The trial court found that Workman's conduct was\n\nmore serious than normally constituting the offenses of rape and that consecutive sentences\n\nwere necessary to protect the public from future crimes.\n\n       {¶ 91} The trial court later memorialized these findings within its sentencing entry.\n\nFrom the trial court's statements at the sentencing hearing and the language used in the\n\nsentencing entry, it is clear that the trial court complied with the dictates of R.C.\n\n2929.14(C)(4).

Bonnell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2014-Ohio-3177, ¶ 37; State v.\n\nSess, 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2015-06-117, 2016-Ohio-5560, ¶ 35-38. It is also clear that\n\nthe record supports the trial court's findings that the harm caused by Workman's offenses\n\nwas so great or unusual that no single prison term adequately reflected the seriousness of\n\nhis conduct and that consecutive sentences were necessary to punish Workman and protect\n\nthe public.\n\n       {¶ 92} Workman argues that he had \"led an otherwise law-abiding life\" until the\n\npresent charges. That argument is completely unpersuasive. The evidence shows that\n\nWorkman was a violent sexual offender who engaged in a nearly decade long pattern of\n                                             - 25 -\n\f                                                                     Clermont CA2016-12-082\n                                                                              CA2016-12-083\n\nabuse with a child. Workman committed the abuse and then threatened the child to prevent\n\ndisclosure of the abuse. Workman was only caught when he sexually abused another child.\n\nThe statement that Workman otherwise led a \"law-abiding life\" is stunningly rebutted by the\n\nrecord.\n\n       {¶ 93} Since we have vacated Workman's conviction and sentence on Count 15, we\n\nhereby reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the matter for resentencing consistent\n\nwith this Opinion. In all other respects, the trial court's judgment on the remaining convictions\n\nis affirmed.\n\n       {¶ 94} Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\n\n\n       PIPER and M. POWELL, JJ., concur.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 26 -\n\f</pre>",
