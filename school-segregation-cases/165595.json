After careful review of this\n\nmotion, the applicable law, and the entire record herein, plaintiffs motion is DENIED.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n       The facts of Morley's case are detailed in prior opinions of this Court and our\n\nCourt of Appeals. See generally Morley v. CIA, 699 F. Supp. 2d 244 (D.D.C. 2010)\n\n(\"Morley 11'); Morley v. CIA, 453 F. Supp. 2d 137 (D.D.C. 2006) (\"Morley 1'), ajJ'd in\n\npart, rev'd in part, 508 F.3d 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"Morley\"). Accordingly, I will\n\nsummarize only those facts that directly bear on Morley's motion for attorney's fees.\n\n       Plaintiff is a journalist, author, and news editor who has written about President\n\nJohn F. Kennedy's assassination. See Morley, 508 F.3d at 1113. On July 4,2003, he\n\nrequested from the CIA, through FOIA, \"all records pertaining to CIA operations officer\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\fGeorge Efythron 10annides ... including, but not limited to\" seventeen specific\n\ncategories of records. Compi. Ex. 1 (\"Morley Letter\") 1-3 [Dkt. # 1-1]. Morley's interest\n\nin 10annides stems from his belief that the former CIA officer was \"uniquely well-\n\npositioned to observe and report\" on the Kennedy assassination. Morley Letter 3.\n\n       The CIA initially responded to Morley's request by directing him to records\n\nrelating to the Kennedy assassination that the CIA had transferred to the National\n\nArchives and Records Administration (\"NARA\"). See Morley, 508 F.3d at 11l3. After\n\nfurther review, the CIA reconsidered its position and, in several productions in 2004 and\n\n2005, sent Morley 3 complete documents, 2 documents in segregable form, and 113\n\nredacted documents. See id. at 1114.1\n\n       Based on these document searches and productions, this Court granted summary\n\njudgment in the Agency's favor. See Morley 1,453 F. Supp. 2d at 144-57. On review,\n\nour Circuit Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. See Morley, 508 F.3d at 11l3,\n\n1129. Specifically, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for the CIA to: (1) search its\n\noperational files, which it had not done previously, id. at 1116-19; (2) search the records\n\nit transferred to NARA, id. at 1119-20; (3) supplement its explanation regarding certain\n\nmonthly reports, which Morley believes should have been filed by 10annides, id. at 1120-\n\n21; (4) provide additional details describing the scope of its search, id. at 1121-22; (5)\n\nexplain to this Court's satisfaction why the withheld information was not segregable, id.\n\n\n\n        The CIA justified these redactions and its withholding of other material under\nvarious FOIA Exemptions including Exemptions 1,2,3, 5,6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Id. It\nalso issued a Glomar response, whereby it declined to confirm or deny the existence of\ncertain records requested by Morley. See id.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fat 1123; (6) substantiate its Glomar response, id. at 1126; and (7) provide additional\n\njustification for withholding documents under FOIA exemptions 2, 5, and 6, id. at 1124-\n\n28. Simultaneously, our Circuit affirmed this Court's decision concerning the CIA's use\n\nof FOIA to respond to Morley's document request, the adequacy of the CIA's Vaughn\n\nindex, and the CIA's withholding of material under FOIA Exemptions 1,3, and 7(3). Id.\n\nat 1129.\n\n       In response to our Circuit's decision, the CIA in 2008 conducted additional\n\nsearches and produced additional material to Morley. In particular, on April 28, 2008,\n\nthe CIA released 113 responsive records from the files it previously transferred to\n\nNARA, and on August 6, 2008, another 293 responsive records from the CIA's files.\n\nPl.'s Mem. P&A Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Award Att'y's Fees & Costs (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") 6 [Dkt. #\n\n107]. The CIA then filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. Def.'s Renewed\n\nMot. Summ. J. [Dkt. #88]. Finding that the CIA conducted adequate searches and\n\nproperly justified its withholdings under applicable FOIA exemptions, this Court granted\n\nthe CIA's motion. Morley II, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 258. Morley now moves this Court for\n\nan award of attorney's fees and costs. Pl.'s Mot. Award Att'y's Fees & Costs (\"Pl.'s\n\nMot.\") 1 [Dkt. #107]. The CIA opposes this motion. Def.'s Opp'n Pl.'s Mot. Att'y's\n\nFees & Costs (\"Opp'n\") [Dkt. #109].\n\n                                       ANALYSIS\n\n   A. Legal Standard\n\n       Under FOIA, a court \"may assess against the United States reasonable attorney\n\nfees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fthe complainant has substantially prevailed.\" 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(E). To obtain this\n\naward, a plaintiff must make two separate showings: (1) he is eligible for an award of\n\nattorney's fees and (2) he is entitled to that award. Weisberg v. Us. Dep 't ofJustice, 745\n\nF.2d 1476,1495 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n\n       First, to be eligible for attorney's fees, a plaintiff must have \"substantially\n\nprevailed.\" 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(E)(i). Next, and equally necessary, the plaintiff must\n\nalso show the court that he is entitled to such an award. Tax Analysts v. Us. Dep 't of\n\nJustice, 965 F.2d 1092, 1093 (D.C. Cir. 1992), superseded by statute on other grounds,\n\nOPEN Government Act of2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524. In determining\n\nwhether a FOIA litigant is entitled to fees, a court must consider the following four,\n\nnonexhaustive factors: \"1) the public benefit derived from the case; 2) the commercial\n\nbenefit to the plaintiff; 3) the nature of the plaintiffs interest in the records; and 4)\n\nwhether the government has a reasonable basis for withholding the requested\n\ninformation.\" Cotton v. Heyman, 63 F.3d 1115, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (internal citation\n\nomitted). But, there is no \"presumption in favor of awarding attorney fees\" to prevailing\n\nFOIA litigants,\" and \"the legislative history of section 552(a)(4)(E) evinces a clear\n\ncongressional intent to leave the courts' broad discretion when considering a request for\n\nattorney fees.\" Nationwide Bldg. Maintenance, Inc. v. Sampson, 559 F.2d 704, 713-14\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1977); see also Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1094 (\"The sifting of those criteria\n\nover the facts of a case is a matter of district court discretion .... \") (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f    B. Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to an Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs.\n\n        Morley contends that he is both eligible and entitled to an award of attorney's fees\n\nunder FOIA. PI.'s Mem. 8, 10. The CIA does not contest whether Morley is eligible to\n\nreceive attorney's fees; instead, the Agency argues that Morley has failed to show that he\n\nis entitled to attorney's fees under any of the four factors. Opp'n 2. For the following\n\nreasons, I agree with the CIA and conclude that Morley is not entitled to an award of\n\nattorney's fees in this case. 2\n\n       1. Public Benefit\n\n        The public benefit factor \"speaks for an award of attorney's fees when the\n\ncomplainant's victory is likely to add to the fund of information that citizens may use in\n\nmaking vital political choices.\" Cotton, 63 F.3d at 1120 (quoting Fenster v. Brown, 617\n\nF.2d 740, 744 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Relevant considerations for this factor include the\n\n2\n        Because I agree with the CIA that Morley is not entitled to attorney's fees, I need\nnot, and will not, analyze whether Morley is also eligible for an award. Although the\nCIA does not directly contest Morley's eligibility, the parties are not in agreement on the\ngoverning standard for whether a plaintiff has substantially prevailed. Plaintiff contends\nthat, because this Court's final ruling followed the enactment of the OPEN Government\nAct of2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, amending 5 U.S.c. ยง 552(a)(4)(E), that\nstatute applies to this case. PI.'s Mem. 8-10. Under that statute's language, a plaintiff\nsubstantially prevails \"if the complainant has obtained relief through either-(I) a judicial\norder, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree; or (II) a voluntary or\nunilateral change in position by the agency, if the complainant's claim is not\ninsubstantial.\" ยง552(a)(4)(E)(ii). Defendant states that because Morley filed his case\nprior to this statute's enactment, this Court may not apply the statute retroactively and is\nbound to apply Buckhannon Bd. & Care Home, Inc. v. W Va. Dep't o/Health & Human\nRes., 532 U.S. 598 (2001). Opp'n 7-9. Prior to the OPEN Government Act's enactment,\nBuckhannon controlled attorney's fee eligibility. Buckhannon held that \"enforceable\njudgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the 'material alteration\nof the legal relationship of the parties' necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees.\"\n532 U.S. at 604 (quoting Tex. State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Indep. Sch. Dist., 489 U.S.\n782, 792-93 (1989)).\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fdisclosure's \"likely degree of dissemination and the public impact that can be expected,\"\n\nPeter S. Herrick's Customs & Int'l Trade Newsletter v. Us. Customs & Border\n\nProtection, No. 04-377, 2006 WL 3060012 at *4 (D.D.C. Oct. 26, 2006) (internal citation\n\nand quotations omitted), and the extent to which the information is already publically\n\navailable, Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1094. As such, the public benefit should be\n\nmeasured by the \"the specific documents at issue in the case at hand.\" Cotton, 63 F.3d at\n\n1120.\n\n        Morley contends that \"[a]s an author and journalist, [he] is in the favored class of\n\nrequesters who 'ordinarily' would be awarded attorney's fees.\" PI.'s Mem. 11. And,\n\nindeed, Morley requested documents regarding J oannides to gain information about the\n\nKennedy assassination. Id. at 11-12; see also Morley Letter 3. While the Kennedy\n\nassassination is surely a matter of public interest, see Weisberg, 543 F.2d at 311, this\n\nlitigation has yielded little, if any, public benefit-certainly an insufficient amount to\n\nsupport an award of attorney's fees.\n\n        Here, in response to our Circuit's decision, the CIA in 2008 conducted additional\n\nsearches and produced to Morley 113 documents from the set of documents previously\n\ntransferred to NARA (\"Kennedy-assassination documents\") and 293 documents from the\n\nCIA's operational files related to Joannides's personnel records. PI. 's Mem. 5-6; Opp'n\n\n5-6. Morley appears to claim that the public benefit primarily derives from the Kennedy-\n\nassassination documents. See PI.'s Reply Def.'s Opp'n (\"Reply\") 4-6,8-9 [Dkt. #112-\n\n\n\n\n                                              6\n\f1]; PI.'s Resp. Def.'s Surreply (\"PI.'s Resp.\") 2-5 [Dkt. #119].3 This litigation did not,\n\nhowever, lead to the publication of the Kennedy-assassination documents.\n\n       Instead, the Kennedy-assassination documents obtained by Morley through this\n\nFOIA litigation are identical to the documents which were previously released under the\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992 (\"JFK Act\") to NARA\n\nand were already in the public domain. Deci. ofD. Nelson (\"Nelson Decl.\") ~ 42, Nov.\n\n21,2008 [Dkt. #89]; PI.'s Reply 9 (\"The copies of the CIA records regarding Joannides\n\nreferred to NARA were released to Morley as official JFK Act Releases with this status\n\nand the date of the release noted on the face of the document.\"). As such, Morley cannot\n\nclaim that any of this information \"add[ s] to the fund of information that citizens may use\n\nin making vital political choices.\" Cotton, 63 F.3d at 1120. 4 Indeed, Morley admits as\n\nmuch in this case when, referencing a document marked \"JFK Act Release,\" PI. Ex. 1\n\n[Dkt. # 112-2], he states: \"Through Morley's use of this and other CIA materials he\n\n\n\n\n3\n       In his initial motion, Morley did not attempt to show that the specific documents\ndisclosed through this litigation conferred a public benefit. See PI.' s Mem. 11-12.\nInstead, Morley initially relied only on his own unsupported assertion that \"[t]here is no\nreason why he should be removed from the class of requesters who are ordinarily\nawarded fees\" and the general fact that information related to the Kennedy assassination\nconcerns the public interest. Id.\n4\n        In a declaration filed with his reply brief, Morley claims that \"this case has yielded\na trove of revelations that have intrigued news editors, JFK scholar [sic], and the reading\npublic.\" Morley Deci. ~ 4, July 19,2010 [Dkt. #112-4]. Morley then describes news\ncoverage concerning this litigation, including some articles he authored. Id. at 2-4; PI.'s\nReply 4-5. But, he fails to explain how any of this information is distinguishable from\nthat already available at NARA.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fobtained from NARA, he enriched public understanding of such matters.\" PI.' s Reply 9\n\n(emphasis added). 5\n\n        Morley tries to circumvent this problem by arguing that \"NARA normally\n\nrequires the requester to do the search and imposes exorbitant copying charges.\" PI.' s\n\nReply 8. But, Morley's using FOIA to sidestep these copying costs and to compel the\n\nCIA to search these records did not exactly further the public benefit. See Chesapeake\n\nBay Found., Inc. v. Dep't ofAgric., 108 F.3d 375, 377 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (\"[T]hat the\n\nFoundation did not have to pay for postage under the [court's order] is hardly a\n\nsignificant public benefit. Nor is the establishment of a legal right to information a public\n\nbenefit .... \"). Indeed, prior to filing this case, \"the public had the benefit of access to all\n\nor most of this information .... \" Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1094 (internal citation and\n\nquotation omitted). Accordingly, considering that Morley has already himself benefitted\n\nby avoiding the copying costs, this Court does not view a further award of attorney's fees\n\nas appropriate in this case.\n\n\n5\n        Morley cites to several, non-binding cases related to FOIA fee-waivers for the\nproposition that prior disclosure does not necessarily preclude documents' providing a\npublic benefit. PI.' s Reply 10-11. Those cases, however, involved disclosures to other\nFOIA requesters, see Carney v. us. Dep't ofJustice, 19 F.3d 807,815 (2d Cir. 1994);\nSchrecker v. Dep 't of Justice, 970 F. Supp. 49, 51 (D.D.C. 1997), and publications in\nagency's reading rooms, see Friends of the Coast Fork v. Us. Dep't ofInterior, 110 F.3d\n53,55 (9th Cir. 1997); Fitzgibbon v. Agencyfor Int'! Dev., 724 F. Supp. 1048, 1051\n(D.D.C. 1989). Those limited disclosures are materially distinguishable from the\nsituation here where documents were transferred to a designated place for public\nreview-NARA. See President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act\nof 1992, Pub. L. No.1 02-526, ยง 4, 106 Stat. 3443-58 (\"All assassination records\ntransmitted to the National Archives for disclosure to the public shall be included in the\nCollection and shall be available to the public for inspection and copying at the National\nArchives .... \").\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       Even if the majority of documents Morley received had not been previously\n\npublic, Morley's claims about the supposed public benefit of the documents produced in\n\nthis litigation are unconvincing as based on nothing more than his own conclusory\n\nopinions and factually inaccurate statements. For instance, Morley claims that his \"suit\n\nprompted the CIA to acknowledge for the first time that Joannides was acting in an\n\nofficial and deceptive capacity\" in his role with the House of Representatives Select\n\nCommittee on Assassinations. PI.'s Reply 6 (quoting Morley Deci. ~ 4(b), July 19,\n\n2010). But, the CIA had previously acknowledged this fact when it released records\n\nunder the JFK Act. Nelson Decl.   ~~   16, 59-60. Morley also argues that his lawsuit\n\nforced the CIA to disclose that Joannides received a \"medal for his work in 1963 and\n\n1978,\" PI.'s Reply 7; PI.'s Resp. 5-6; Morley Deci.   ~   4(c), July 19,2010. But, Morley\n\noverstates this medal's importance to his case as in fact this was a \"Career Intelligence\n\nMedal\" awarded for Joannides's 28 years of service from 1950 to 1978. Morley Decl.,\n\nOct. 24, 2010, Attach. 2 [Dkt. # 119-1].6 Finally, Morley makes one more argument,\n\nwhich actually undermines his claim that this case has conferred a public benefit.\n\n       Morley claims that this Court should award attorney's fees based on documents\n\nwithheld by the CIA. See PI. 's Reply 7 (\"[T]he lawsuit has made it clear that the CIA\n\nretains a significant body of JFK assassination-related records that it has not reviewed\n\n\n6\n       Morley makes a similarly unfounded claim that Joannides's traveling to New\nOrleans twice during the same period that Warren Commission investigators were\nconducting interviews in New Orleans is \"unquestionably new information of interest to\nscholars of the assassination and to the general public.\" PI.'s Resp. 4 (quoting Morley\nDecl. ~ 2, Oct. 24, 2010 [Dkt. # 119-1]).\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fand released as mandated by the JFK Records Act.\"); PI. 's Resp. 4-5. But those\n\ndocuments were properly withheld under FOIA, see Morley IL 699 F. Supp. 2d at 252-\n\n59, and therefore, his argument must fail. Even so, the CIA has stated that most of these\n\nrecords are completely unrelated to the Kennedy assassination. See Nelson Decl. ~ 55. 7\n\nAccordingly, the public benefit factor weighs strongly in the CIA's favor.\n\n       2. Plaintifrs Commercial Benefit and the Nature of Plaintifrs Interest\n\n       The second and third factors, the plaintiffs commercial benefit and the nature of\n\nplaintiffs interest, \"are closely related and often considered together.\" Tax Analysts, 965\n\nF.2d at 1095. As our Circuit Court instructed in Davy v. CIA, 550 F.3d. 1155 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008), these factors are intended to assess whether a plaintiff has \"sufficient private\n\nincentive to seek disclosure\" recognizing that \"many FOIA plaintiffs do not have the\n\nfinancial resources or economic incentives to pursue their requests through expensive\n\nlitigation.\" Id. at 1158, 1160 (internal citations and quotations omitted). But, \"when a\n\nlitigant seeks disclosure for a commercial benefit or out of personal motives, an award of\n\nattorney's fees is generally inappropriate.\" Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1095. (internal\n\ncitations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n7\n        Morley, nevertheless, maintains that these records are related to the Kennedy\nassassination and should have been released under the JFK Act. In his Response to the\nDefendant's Surreply, Morley, referencing the 295 documents withheld by the CIA under\nFOIA, states: \"according to Judge John Tunheim, they meet the legal criteria of JFK-\nassassination-related records.\" Pl.'s Resp. 5 (emphasis added). Morley apparently bases\nthis statement on a quote in a newspaper article, from Judge Tunheim, the former\nchairman of the Assassination Records Review Board, in which Judge Tunheim states:\n\"This material should be released.\" See Scott Shane, C.I.A. Is Still Cagey About Oswald\nMystery, N.Y. Times, Oct. 17,2009. This Court finds Morley's argument to be not only\nunpersuasive, but also misguided.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       Morley asserts that these factors favor a fee award because (1) any commercial\n\nbenefit he received should not disquality him from an award because he \"belongs to the\n\ncategory of requesters favored to receive both fee waivers and attorney's fees\" and (2) his\n\ninterest \"fits in the scholarly-journalistic category.\" Pl.'s Mem. 13-17. Morley admits\n\nthat he received \"minimal\" compensation for writing news articles about this matter but\n\nhas \"no book contract.\" Morley Decl. ~ 6, July 19,2010. But, Morley claims that he is\n\n\"interested in historical truth.\" Id.   ~   7. Although Morley is correct, to the extent that\n\nthese points by themselves would not preclude him from receiving attorney's fees, it\n\ncertainly cannot be said that Morley's whole purpose was \"to increase the public fund of\n\nknowledge about a matter of public concern.\" Davy, 550 F.3d at 1162.\n\n       Rather, as the CIA correctly points out, Morley had an interest in obtaining the\n\nNARA records \"from the CIA at little or no charge under FOIA\" to avoid expending his\n\nown time and money to obtain the documents from NARA. Opp'n 16; cf Pl.'s Reply 8\n\n(\"NARA normally requires the requester to do the search and imposes exorbitant copying\n\ncharges.\"). I find, therefore, that these two factors indicate that Morley has a sufficient\n\nprivate interest in pursuing these records without attorney's fees. See 550 F.3d at 1160.\n\n       3. Reasonableness of CIA's Original Withholding\n\n       Because the CIA has advanced reasonable legal positions, this Court concludes\n\nthat the fourth factor also weighs against an award of attorney's fees. The final factor\n\nconsiders whether the government had a reasonable or colorable basis for withholding\n\ndocuments and whether the government was recalcitrant or obdurate in opposing a valid\n\nclaim. Id. at 1162. Although none of the factors is solely dispositive, the \"failure to\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fsatisfy the fourth element ... may foreclose a claim for attorney's fees or costs.\"\n\nMayadak v.   us. Dep 't ofJustice, 579 F. Supp. 2d 105, 108-09 (D.D.C. 2008) (internal\ncitations and quotations omitted).\n\n       Morley contends that the CIA engaged in \"dilatory tactics\" in its initial response to\n\nMorley's FOIA request and then continued with \"delaying tactics\" by asserting its\n\nGlomar response and litigating whether its operational records were exempt from FOIA.\n\nPl.'s Mem. 16-17; Pl.'s Reply 15-18. I disagree.\n\n       The CIA has not only relied on reasonable legal interpretations but also acted\n\nreasonably throughout this case. First, in response to Morley's FOIA request letter\n\nseeking materials to \"shed new light on the assassination of President Kennedy,\" Morley\n\nLetter 3, the CIA directed Morley to the logical repository of such records-NARA.\n\nSecond, the CIA was certainly reasonable in its assertion of a Glomar response\n\nconcerning Joannides's participation in covert operations: after the CIA expanded its\n\nexplanation for making the Glomar response at our Circuit Court's instruction, this Court\n\nfound that explanation adequate. Morley II, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 257-58. Further, the CIA\n\nhad a reasonable legal basis for initially contesting Morley's request to search its\n\noperational files. Although our Circuit eventually ruled against the CIA on this point, the\n\ncourt noted that the CIA relied on the \"only opinion by a circuit court of appeals\" to\n\naddress the relevant FOIA exemption under the CIA Act, 50 U.S.C. ยง 431. Morley, 508\n\nF.3d at 1118. Finally, there is no indication in the record that the CIA has engaged in any\n\nrecalcitrant or obdurate behavior. Cf Davy, 550 F.3d at 1163 (holding that fourth factor\n\nweighed against agency where agency took more than one year to process documents and\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fprovided no legal basis in response to a second FOIA request). In sum, this factor also\n\nweighs strongly in favor of the CIA.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       F or all these reasons, the Court concludes that the plaintiff is not entitled to\n\nattorney's fees.   &   Thus, plaintiffs motion must, and will be, DENIED. An appropriate\n\nOrder will issue with this Memorandum herewith.\n\n\n                                                                   -J\n\n\n\n\n&\n      Because Morley is not entitled to fees, there is no need for this Court to assess\nwhether Morley's attorney's fee request is reasonable.\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f",

Cir. 2007) (\"Morley\"). Accordingly, I will\n\nsummarize only those facts that directly bear on Morley's motion for attorney's fees.\n\n       Plaintiff is a journalist, author, and news editor who has written about President\n\nJohn F. Kennedy's assassination. See Morley, 508 F.3d at 1113. On July 4,2003, he\n\nrequested from the CIA, through FOIA, \"all records pertaining to CIA operations officer\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\fGeorge Efythron 10annides ... including, but not limited to\" seventeen specific\n\ncategories of records. Compi. Ex. 1 (\"Morley Letter\") 1-3 [Dkt. # 1-1]. Morley's interest\n\nin 10annides stems from his belief that the former CIA officer was \"uniquely well-\n\npositioned to observe and report\" on the Kennedy assassination. Morley Letter 3.\n\n       The CIA initially responded to Morley's request by directing him to records\n\nrelating to the Kennedy assassination that the CIA had transferred to the National\n\nArchives and Records Administration (\"NARA\"). See Morley, 508 F.3d at 11l3. After\n\nfurther review, the CIA reconsidered its position and, in several productions in 2004 and\n\n2005, sent Morley 3 complete documents, 2 documents in segregable form, and 113\n\nredacted documents. See id. at 1114.1\n\n       Based on these document searches and productions, this Court granted summary\n\njudgment in the Agency's favor. See Morley 1,453 F. Supp. 2d at 144-57. On review,\n\nour Circuit Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. See Morley, 508 F.3d at 11l3,\n\n1129. Specifically, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for the CIA to: (1) search its\n\noperational files, which it had not done previously, id. at 1116-19; (2) search the records\n\nit transferred to NARA, id. at 1119-20; (3) supplement its explanation regarding certain\n\nmonthly reports, which Morley believes should have been filed by 10annides, id. at 1120-\n\n21; (4) provide additional details describing the scope of its search, id. at 1121-22; (5)\n\nexplain to this Court's satisfaction why the withheld information was not segregable, id.\n\n\n\n        The CIA justified these redactions and its withholding of other material under\nvarious FOIA Exemptions including Exemptions 1,2,3, 5,6, 7(C), 7(D), and 7(E). Id. It\nalso issued a Glomar response, whereby it declined to confirm or deny the existence of\ncertain records requested by Morley. See id.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fat 1123; (6) substantiate its Glomar response, id. at 1126; and (7) provide additional\n\njustification for withholding documents under FOIA exemptions 2, 5, and 6, id. at 1124-\n\n28. Simultaneously, our Circuit affirmed this Court's decision concerning the CIA's use\n\nof FOIA to respond to Morley's document request, the adequacy of the CIA's Vaughn\n\nindex, and the CIA's withholding of material under FOIA Exemptions 1,3, and 7(3). Id.\n\nat 1129.\n\n       In response to our Circuit's decision, the CIA in 2008 conducted additional\n\nsearches and produced additional material to Morley. In particular, on April 28, 2008,\n\nthe CIA released 113 responsive records from the files it previously transferred to\n\nNARA, and on August 6, 2008, another 293 responsive records from the CIA's files.\n\nPl.'s Mem. P&A Supp. Pl.'s Mot. Award Att'y's Fees & Costs (\"Pl.'s Mem.\") 6 [Dkt. #\n\n107]. The CIA then filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. Def.'s Renewed\n\nMot. Summ. J. [Dkt. #88]. Finding that the CIA conducted adequate searches and\n\nproperly justified its withholdings under applicable FOIA exemptions, this Court granted\n\nthe CIA's motion. Morley II, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 258. Morley now moves this Court for\n\nan award of attorney's fees and costs. Pl.'s Mot. Award Att'y's Fees & Costs (\"Pl.'s\n\nMot.\") 1 [Dkt. #107]. The CIA opposes this motion.

Legal Standard\n\n       Under FOIA, a court \"may assess against the United States reasonable attorney\n\nfees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\fthe complainant has substantially prevailed.\" 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(a)(4)(E).

In determining\n\nwhether a FOIA litigant is entitled to fees, a court must consider the following four,\n\nnonexhaustive factors: \"1) the public benefit derived from the case; 2) the commercial\n\nbenefit to the plaintiff; 3) the nature of the plaintiffs interest in the records; and 4)\n\nwhether the government has a reasonable basis for withholding the requested\n\ninformation.\" Cotton v.

Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to an Award of Attorney's Fees and Costs.\n\n        Morley contends that he is both eligible and entitled to an award of attorney's fees\n\nunder FOIA. PI.'s Mem. 8, 10. The CIA does not contest whether Morley is eligible to\n\nreceive attorney's fees; instead, the Agency argues that Morley has failed to show that he\n\nis entitled to attorney's fees under any of the four factors. Opp'n 2. For the following\n\nreasons, I agree with the CIA and conclude that Morley is not entitled to an award of\n\nattorney's fees in this case. 2\n\n       1. Public Benefit\n\n        The public benefit factor \"speaks for an award of attorney's fees when the\n\ncomplainant's victory is likely to add to the fund of information that citizens may use in\n\nmaking vital political choices.\" Cotton, 63 F.3d at 1120 (quoting Fenster v.

Relevant considerations for this factor include the\n\n2\n        Because I agree with the CIA that Morley is not entitled to attorney's fees, I need\nnot, and will not, analyze whether Morley is also eligible for an award. Although the\nCIA does not directly contest Morley's eligibility, the parties are not in agreement on the\ngoverning standard for whether a plaintiff has substantially prevailed. Plaintiff contends\nthat, because this Court's final ruling followed the enactment of the OPEN Government\nAct of2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, amending 5 U.S.c. ยง 552(a)(4)(E), that\nstatute applies to this case. PI.'s Mem. 8-10.

And,\n\nindeed, Morley requested documents regarding J oannides to gain information about the\n\nKennedy assassination. Id. at 11-12; see also Morley Letter 3. While the Kennedy\n\nassassination is surely a matter of public interest, see Weisberg, 543 F.2d at 311, this\n\nlitigation has yielded little, if any, public benefit-certainly an insufficient amount to\n\nsupport an award of attorney's fees.\n\n        Here, in response to our Circuit's decision, the CIA in 2008 conducted additional\n\nsearches and produced to Morley 113 documents from the set of documents previously\n\ntransferred to NARA (\"Kennedy-assassination documents\") and 293 documents from the\n\nCIA's operational files related to Joannides's personnel records.

As such, Morley cannot\n\nclaim that any of this information \"add[ s] to the fund of information that citizens may use\n\nin making vital political choices.\" Cotton, 63 F.3d at 1120. 4 Indeed, Morley admits as\n\nmuch in this case when, referencing a document marked \"JFK Act Release,\" PI.

But, he fails to explain how any of this information is distinguishable from\nthat already available at NARA.\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fobtained from NARA, he enriched public understanding of such matters.\" PI.' s Reply 9\n\n(emphasis added). 5\n\n        Morley tries to circumvent this problem by arguing that \"NARA normally\n\nrequires the requester to do the search and imposes exorbitant copying charges.\" PI.' s\n\nReply 8. But, Morley's using FOIA to sidestep these copying costs and to compel the\n\nCIA to search these records did not exactly further the public benefit. See Chesapeake\n\nBay Found., Inc. v. Dep't ofAgric., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"737391\"><a href=\"/opinion/737391/chesapeake-bay-foundation-inc-v-department-of-agriculture/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377 (D.C.

Indeed, prior to filing this case, \"the public had the benefit of access to all\n\nor most of this information .... \" Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1094 (internal citation and\n\nquotation omitted). Accordingly, considering that Morley has already himself benefitted\n\nby avoiding the copying costs, this Court does not view a further award of attorney's fees\n\nas appropriate in this case.\n\n\n5\n        Morley cites to several, non-binding cases related to FOIA fee-waivers for the\nproposition that prior disclosure does not necessarily preclude documents' providing a\npublic benefit. PI.' s Reply 10-11. Those cases, however, involved disclosures to other\nFOIA requesters, see Carney v. us. Dep't ofJustice, 19 F.3d 807,815 (2d Cir. 1994);\nSchrecker v.

Those limited disclosures are materially distinguishable from the\nsituation here where documents were transferred to a designated place for public\nreview-NARA. See President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act\nof 1992, Pub. L. No.1 02-526, ยง 4, 106 Stat. 3443-58 (\"All assassination records\ntransmitted to the National Archives for disclosure to the public shall be included in the\nCollection and shall be available to the public for inspection and copying at the National\nArchives .... \").\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       Even if the majority of documents Morley received had not been previously\n\npublic, Morley's claims about the supposed public benefit of the documents produced in\n\nthis litigation are unconvincing as based on nothing more than his own conclusory\n\nopinions and factually inaccurate statements. For instance, Morley claims that his \"suit\n\nprompted the CIA to acknowledge for the first time that Joannides was acting in an\n\nofficial and deceptive capacity\" in his role with the House of Representatives Select\n\nCommittee on Assassinations. PI.'s Reply 6 (quoting Morley Deci. ~ 4(b), July 19,\n\n2010). But, the CIA had previously acknowledged this fact when it released records\n\nunder the JFK Act. Nelson Decl.   ~~   16, 59-60. Morley also argues that his lawsuit\n\nforced the CIA to disclose that Joannides received a \"medal for his work in 1963 and\n\n1978,\" PI.'s Reply 7; PI.'s Resp. 5-6; Morley Deci.   ~   4(c), July 19,2010. But, Morley\n\noverstates this medal's importance to his case as in fact this was a \"Career Intelligence\n\nMedal\" awarded for Joannides's 28 years of service from 1950 to 1978. Morley Decl.,\n\nOct. 24, 2010, Attach. 2 [Dkt. # 119-1].6 Finally, Morley makes one more argument,\n\nwhich actually undermines his claim that this case has conferred a public benefit.\n\n       Morley claims that this Court should award attorney's fees based on documents\n\nwithheld by the CIA. See PI. 's Reply 7 (\"[T]he lawsuit has made it clear that the CIA\n\nretains a significant body of JFK assassination-related records that it has not reviewed\n\n\n6\n       Morley makes a similarly unfounded claim that Joannides's traveling to New\nOrleans twice during the same period that Warren Commission investigators were\nconducting interviews in New Orleans is \"unquestionably new information of interest to\nscholars of the assassination and to the general public.\" PI.'s Resp. 4 (quoting Morley\nDecl. ~ 2, Oct. 24, 2010 [Dkt. # 119-1]).\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\fand released as mandated by the JFK Records Act.\"); PI. 's Resp. 4-5. But those\n\ndocuments were properly withheld under FOIA, see Morley IL 699 F. Supp. 2d at 252-\n\n59, and therefore, his argument must fail. Even so, the CIA has stated that most of these\n\nrecords are completely unrelated to the Kennedy assassination. See Nelson Decl. ~ 55. 7\n\nAccordingly, the public benefit factor weighs strongly in the CIA's favor.\n\n       2. Plaintifrs Commercial Benefit and the Nature of Plaintifrs Interest\n\n       The second and third factors, the plaintiffs commercial benefit and the nature of\n\nplaintiffs interest, \"are closely related and often considered together.\" Tax Analysts, 965\n\nF.2d at 1095. As our Circuit Court instructed in Davy v. CIA, 550 F.3d. 1155 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2008), these factors are intended to assess whether a plaintiff has \"sufficient private\n\nincentive to seek disclosure\" recognizing that \"many FOIA plaintiffs do not have the\n\nfinancial resources or economic incentives to pursue their requests through expensive\n\nlitigation.\" Id. at 1158, 1160 (internal citations and quotations omitted). But, \"when a\n\nlitigant seeks disclosure for a commercial benefit or out of personal motives, an award of\n\nattorney's fees is generally inappropriate.\" Tax Analysts, 965 F.2d at 1095. (internal\n\ncitations and quotations omitted).\n\n\n7\n        Morley, nevertheless, maintains that these records are related to the Kennedy\nassassination and should have been released under the JFK Act. In his Response to the\nDefendant's Surreply, Morley, referencing the 295 documents withheld by the CIA under\nFOIA, states: \"according to Judge John Tunheim, they meet the legal criteria of JFK-\nassassination-related records.\" Pl.'s Resp. 5 (emphasis added). Morley apparently bases\nthis statement on a quote in a newspaper article, from Judge Tunheim, the former\nchairman of the Assassination Records Review Board, in which Judge Tunheim states:\n\"This material should be released.\" See Scott Shane, C.I.A. Is Still Cagey About Oswald\nMystery, N.Y. Times, Oct. 17,2009. This Court finds Morley's argument to be not only\nunpersuasive, but also misguided.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       Morley asserts that these factors favor a fee award because (1) any commercial\n\nbenefit he received should not disquality him from an award because he \"belongs to the\n\ncategory of requesters favored to receive both fee waivers and attorney's fees\" and (2) his\n\ninterest \"fits in the scholarly-journalistic category.\" Pl.'s Mem. 13-17. Morley admits\n\nthat he received \"minimal\" compensation for writing news articles about this matter but\n\nhas \"no book contract.\" Morley Decl. ~ 6, July 19,2010. But, Morley claims that he is\n\n\"interested in historical truth.\" Id.   ~   7. Although Morley is correct, to the extent that\n\nthese points by themselves would not preclude him from receiving attorney's fees, it\n\ncertainly cannot be said that Morley's whole purpose was \"to increase the public fund of\n\nknowledge about a matter of public concern.\" Davy, 550 F.3d at 1162.\n\n       Rather, as the CIA correctly points out, Morley had an interest in obtaining the\n\nNARA records \"from the CIA at little or no charge under FOIA\" to avoid expending his\n\nown time and money to obtain the documents from NARA. Opp'n 16; cf Pl.'s Reply 8\n\n(\"NARA normally requires the requester to do the search and imposes exorbitant copying\n\ncharges.\"). I find, therefore, that these two factors indicate that Morley has a sufficient\n\nprivate interest in pursuing these records without attorney's fees. See 550 F.3d at 1160.\n\n       3. Reasonableness of CIA's Original Withholding\n\n       Because the CIA has advanced reasonable legal positions, this Court concludes\n\nthat the fourth factor also weighs against an award of attorney's fees. The final factor\n\nconsiders whether the government had a reasonable or colorable basis for withholding\n\ndocuments and whether the government was recalcitrant or obdurate in opposing a valid\n\nclaim. Id. at 1162. Although none of the factors is solely dispositive, the \"failure to\n\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fsatisfy the fourth element ... may foreclose a claim for attorney's fees or costs.\"\n\nMayadak v.   us. Dep 't ofJustice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562687\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562687/maydak-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">579</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 108-09 (D.D.C. 2008) (internal\ncitations and quotations omitted).\n\n       Morley contends that the CIA engaged in \"dilatory tactics\" in its initial response to\n\nMorley's FOIA request and then continued with \"delaying tactics\" by asserting its\n\nGlomar response and litigating whether its operational records were exempt from FOIA.\n\nPl.'s Mem. 16-17; Pl.'s Reply 15-18. I disagree.\n\n       The CIA has not only relied on reasonable legal interpretations but also acted\n\nreasonably throughout this case. First, in response to Morley's FOIA request letter\n\nseeking materials to \"shed new light on the assassination of President Kennedy,\" Morley\n\nLetter 3, the CIA directed Morley to the logical repository of such records-NARA.\n\nSecond, the CIA was certainly reasonable in its assertion of a Glomar response\n\nconcerning Joannides's participation in covert operations: after the CIA expanded its\n\nexplanation for making the Glomar response at our Circuit Court's instruction, this Court\n\nfound that explanation adequate. Morley II, 699 F. Supp. 2d at 257-58. Further, the CIA\n\nhad a reasonable legal basis for initially contesting Morley's request to search its\n\noperational files. Although our Circuit eventually ruled against the CIA on this point, the\n\ncourt noted that the CIA relied on the \"only opinion by a circuit court of appeals\" to\n\naddress the relevant FOIA exemption under the CIA Act, 50 U.S.C. ยง 431. Morley, 508\n\nF.3d at 1118. Finally, there is no indication in the record that the CIA has engaged in any\n\nrecalcitrant or obdurate behavior. Cf Davy, 550 F.3d at 1163 (holding that fourth factor\n\nweighed against agency where agency took more than one year to process documents and\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fprovided no legal basis in response to a second FOIA request). In sum, this factor also\n\nweighs strongly in favor of the CIA.\n\n                                        CONCLUSION\n\n       F or all these reasons, the Court concludes that the plaintiff is not entitled to\n\nattorney's fees.   &   Thus, plaintiffs motion must, and will be, DENIED. An appropriate\n\nOrder will issue with this Memorandum herewith.\n\n\n                                                                   -J\n\n\n\n\n&\n      Because Morley is not entitled to fees, there is no need for this Court to assess\nwhether Morley's attorney's fee request is reasonable.\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\f</pre>",
