Plaintiff-Appellant Equity in Athletics,\nInc. (EIA), a membership organization comprised of student-\nathletes, coaches, parents, alumni, and fans, is a not-for-profit\nVirginia nonstock corporation. In this lawsuit seeking declara-\ntory and injunctive relief, EIA challenges the Department of\nEducation’s (DOE) interpretative guidelines implementing the\nequal opportunity mandate of Title IX of the Education\nAmendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-318, 86 Stat. 373, 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1681-88 (Title IX). EIA alleges that the guidelines violate\nTitle IX, the U.S. Constitution, and the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § § 551 et seq. EIA also seeks relief\nagainst James Madison University (JMU), challenging JMU’s\n2006 decision to eliminate ten of the university’s varsity ath-\nletic teams (seven men’s teams and three women’s teams), on\nthe grounds that the elimination of those teams violates Title\nIX, the U.S. Constitution, and Virginia law. The district court\n\f         EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION                    5\ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the case;\nEIA has noted a timely appeal. For the reasons that follow, we\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                      I.\n\n   We begin with a brief review of the statutory and regula-\ntory background relevant to this case.\n\n   In 1972, Congress enacted Title IX, which provides in part\nthat \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of\nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any education pro-\ngram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20\nU.S.C. § 1681. Title IX did not specifically address its appli-\ncation to athletics, and in 1974, Congress enacted the Javits\nAmendment, which directed the Secretary of Health, Educa-\ntion, and Welfare (\"HEW\") to \"prepare and publish . . . pro-\nposed regulations which shall include with respect to\nintercollegiate athletic activities reasonable provisions consid-\nering the nature of particular sports.\" Education Amendments\nof 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 844 (1974) (Javits Amend-\nment).\n\n   On June 20, 1974, HEW published its proposed regulations\nimplementing Title IX, containing provisions that addressed\nthe statute’s application to athletic programs. 39 Fed. Reg.\n22,227, 22,236 (June 20, 1974). HEW followed notice and\ncomment rulemaking procedures, and President Ford\napproved the final regulations, as required by Title IX, 20\nU.S.C. § 1682.1 Effective July 21, 1975, the regulations pro-\n  1\n    The relevant portion of the provision reads: \"Each Federal department\nand agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to\nany education program or activity . . . is authorized and directed to effectu-\nate the provisions of section 1681 of this title with respect to such program\nor activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability\nwhich shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is\ntaken. No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and\nuntil approved by the President.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1682.\n\f6      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nvided in part that \"[a] recipient which operates or sponsors\ninterscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics\nshall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both\nsexes.\" 45 C.F.R. § 86.41(c). One of the ten factors used to\ndetermine equality of opportunity is \"[w]hether the selection\nof sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate\nthe interests and abilities of members of both sexes.\" Id.\n\n   In December 1978, HEW issued a Proposed Policy Inter-\npretation to provide further guidance for the 1975 regulations.\n43 Fed. Reg. 58,070 (Dec. 11, 1978). After receiving numer-\nous comments in response to its proposed interpretation,\nHEW issued a Final Policy Interpretation in December 1979.\n44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (Dec. 11, 1979). The Policy Interpreta-\ntion aimed to supply guidance to educational institutions to\n\"effectively accommodat[e] the interests and abilities of male\nand female athletes\" and provided that compliance would be\nassessed \"in any one of the following ways\":\n\n       (1) Whether intercollegiate level participation\n    opportunities for male and female students are pro-\n    vided in numbers substantially proportionate to their\n    respective enrollments; or\n\n       (2) Where the members of one sex have been and\n    are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes,\n    whether the institution can show a history and con-\n    tinuing practice of program expansion which is\n    demonstrably responsive to the developing interest\n    and abilities of the members of that sex; or\n\n       (3) Where the members of one sex are underrepre-\n    sented among intercollegiate athletes and the institu-\n    tion cannot show a continuing practice of program\n    expansion such as that cited above, whether it can be\n    demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the\n    members of that sex have been fully and effectively\n    accommodated by the present program.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       7\nId. at 71,418. This provision has come to be known as the\n\"Three-Part Test,\" and its first prong is at the heart of EIA’s\nclaims in this case against DOE and JMU.\n\n   In 1979, Congress split HEW into the Department of\nHealth and Human Services and the Department of Education.\nSee Department of Education Organization Act, 20 U.S.C.\n§ § 3401-3510, Pub. L. 96-88 (1979). As part of that reorgani-\nzation, HEW’s functions with respect to educational programs\nwere transferred to the Department of Education. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 3441(a)(3) (transferring to DOE all functions of HEW’s\nOffice of Civil Rights, \"which relate to functions transferred\nby this section\"); see also N. Haven Bd. of Educ. v. Bell, 456\nU.S. 512, 517 n.4 (1982) (\"HEW’s functions under Title IX\nwere transferred . . . to the Department of Education.\");\nMcCormick ex rel. McCormick v. Sch. Dist. of Mamaroneck,\n370 F.3d 275, 287 (2d Cir. 2004) (noting that \"we treat [DOE]\nas the administrative agency charged with administering Title\nIX\").\n\n   In 1996, after soliciting public comments on its proposal,\nDOE issued a clarification to the 1979 Policy Interpretation.\nThe clarification provided that institutions need only comply\nwith one part of the Three-Part Test and enumerated factors\nthat would guide DOE’s analysis of compliance under each\npart. Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guid-\nance: The Three-Part Test (Jan. 16, 1996), transmitted by Let-\nter from Norma V. Cantu, Assistant Secretary for Civil\nRights, Department of Education (\"1996 Clarification\"),\nreprinted in J.A. 407-23 (guidelines provide \"three individual\navenues to choose from\" in order to comply).\n\n   In 2003, DOE issued a Further Clarification, which reiter-\nated that the 1979 Policy Interpretation did not mandate\nreductions to men’s teams and noted that DOE disfavored the\nelimination of teams as a means of compliance. Further Clar-\nification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Guidance Regard-\ning Title IX Compliance (July 11, 2003), transmitted by Letter\n\f8       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nfrom Gerald Reynolds, Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights,\nDepartment of Education (\"2003 Further Clarification\"),\nreprinted in J.A. 424-26.\n\n   In 2005, DOE issued an Additional Clarification, empha-\nsizing that institutions could demonstrate compliance under\nany prong of the Three-Part Test. See Additional Clarification\nof Intercollegiate Athletics Policy Three-Part Test–Part Three\n(March 17, 2005), transmitted by Letter from James F. Man-\nning, Delegated Authority of Assistant Secretary for Civil\nRights, Department of Education (\"2005 Additional Clarifica-\ntion\"), reprinted in J.A. 427-42. While attempting to delineate\ninstitutions’ obligations under Title IX, these clarifications\nhave emphasized that DOE intended to provide schools with\nflexibility in selecting methods of achieving compliance.\n\n                                  II.\n\n   The parties here agree that the cardinal facts giving rise to\nthis litigation are essentially undisputed. On September 29,\n2006, JMU announced its plan to eliminate seven men’s and\nthree women’s athletic teams in order to bring its intercolle-\ngiate athletic program into compliance with Title IX.2 In a\npress release issued following its decision, JMU noted that, as\nof the 2006 fall semester, although women represented 61%\nof the undergraduate student body, they constituted only\n50.7% of the varsity intercollegiate athletes. The press release\nwent on to announce that the proposed cuts would yield a\nfemale athletic participation rate of 61%, a figure that would\nalign more closely with female student enrollment.\n\n  In explaining its decision to eliminate the designated teams,\nJMU stated that \"[a]lternatives were proposed, considered,\nand analyzed to deal with the need to come into compliance\nwith Title IX,\" but ultimately, \"the university was left with the\n    2\n   JMU is a state-sponsored university in Virginia that has received and\ncontinues to receive federal funds.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       9\nneed to comply with the proportionality prong [of the Three-\nPart Test].\" J.A. 344. The university found that compliance\nunder either of the two other prongs of the Three-Part Test\nwas untenable. With respect to the second prong of the Test,\nJMU determined that it could not demonstrate a history or\ncontinuing pattern of program expansion to accommodate the\nneeds of the under-represented sex, having added only one\nwomen’s sport since 1990. JMU also found it could not com-\nply with the third prong of accommodating unmet student\ninterest, as \"[a]ny solution that would require the addition of\nsports beyond the current 28 teams was deemed unaccept-\nable.\" J.A. 344. As the university explained, \"The primary\nreason for the decision was to bring JMU into compliance\nwith the law.\" J.A. 344. The proposed team eliminations took\neffect on July 1, 2007.\n\n   Meanwhile, opponents of JMU’s decision incorporated EIA\non February 5, 2007 in order to challenge JMU’s proposed\ncuts. On March 19, 2007, EIA filed this action against DOE,\nthe Secretary of Education, the Assistant Secretary for Civil\nRights, and the United States (\"federal defendants\"), challeng-\ning Title IX’s interpretive guidelines. In particular, EIA\nasserted that DOE’s 1979 Policy Interpretation, i.e., the\nThree-Part Test, and its subsequent Policy Clarifications vio-\nlated Title IX, the U.S. Constitution, and the APA. At about\nthe time it filed suit against the federal defendants, EIA\nrequested that JMU defer its proposed elimination of the ten\nteams and, when JMU refused, EIA amended its complaint to\njoin JMU and numerous JMU officials as defendants. EIA’s\ncomplaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would\ninvalidate the allegedly unlawful guidelines and forestall\nJMU’s proposed team eliminations. In the alternative, EIA\nsought damages under Title IX to compel JMU to equalize\nscholarship payments to student-athletes affected by the\nalleged scholarship gap created by JMU’s decision to elimi-\nnate teams.\n\f10      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n   On June 15, 2007, EIA filed a motion for a preliminary\ninjunction to prevent JMU from going forward with its plan\nto cut the athletic teams slated for elimination. The district\ncourt denied the motion for preliminary injunction, Equity in\nAthletics, Inc. v. United States Department of Education, 504\nF. Supp. 2d 88 (W.D. Va. 2007), and we affirmed the district\ncourt, 291 Fed. Appx. 517 (4th Cir. 2008) (unpublished), cert.\ndenied, 129 S. Ct. 1613 (2009). Following the appeal of the\ndenial of its motion for a preliminary injunction, EIA filed a\nsecond amended complaint, and the parties filed dispositive\nmotions. On December 30, 2009, the district court granted the\ndefendants’ motions to dismiss and entered final judgment.\nEquity in Athletics, Inc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 675 F. Supp. 2d\n660 (W.D. Va. 2009) (the \"District Court Opinion\"). EIA\nbrought this timely appeal. We review a district court’s grant\nof a motion to dismiss de novo.3 Nemet Chevrolet, Ltd. v.\nConsumeraffairs.com, Inc., 591 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir. 2009).\n\n                                   III.\n\n   We first address the issue of standing, which is indispens-\nable to a federal court’s exercise of jurisdiction. The federal\ndefendants challenge EIA’s standing to bring this suit, argu-\ning that the underlying injury of which it complains could be\nredressed only by the university. JMU, on the other hand,\ncontends that EIA’s membership does not include female ath-\nletes on existing teams; it thus argues that EIA lacks standing\nto challenge the university’s scholarship allocation. JMU does\nnot contest EIA’s standing with respect to its other claims.\n  3\n    The district court had before it EIA’s motion for summary judgment\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 56 and the defendants’ motions to dismiss for failure\nto state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The district court granted\nthe defendants’ motions and denied EIA’s motion, but it effectively\ntreated all the motions as motions for summary judgment without objec-\ntion from any of the parties. We discern no disputes of material fact, and\nno party raises any issues with respect to the content of the record before\nus.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION        11\n   Where, as here, the plaintiff is an organization bringing suit\non behalf of its members, it must satisfy three requirements\nto secure organizational standing: (1) that its members would\nhave standing to sue as individuals; (2) that the interests it\nseeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose;\nand (3) that the suit does not require the participation of indi-\nvidual members. Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising\nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). Individual members of\nthe organization must be able to show that (1) they suffered\nan actual or threatened injury that is concrete, particularized,\nand not conjectural; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the\nchallenged conduct; and (3) the injury is likely to be redressed\nby a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); Miller v. Brown, 462 F.3d 312, 316\n(4th Cir. 2006). This court assumes the merits of a dispute\nwill be resolved in favor of the party invoking our jurisdiction\nin assessing standing and, at the pleading stage, \"presumes\nthat general allegations embrace those specific facts that are\nnecessary to support the claim.\" Lujan v. National Wildlife\nFederation, 497 U.S. 871, 889 (1990); see also Parker v. Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 478 F.3d 370, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2007), aff’d\nby District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008) (\"The\nSupreme Court has made clear that when considering whether\na plaintiff has Article III standing, a federal court must\nassume arguendo the merits of his or her legal claim.\").\nNonetheless, the Court has clarified that \"pleadings must be\nsomething more than an ingenious academic exercise in the\nconceivable.\" U.S. v. Students Challenging Regulatory\nAgency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 688 (1973).\n\n   We find that EIA meets the requirements for organizational\nstanding as to its claims against DOE and JMU. It appears\nuncontested that the interests EIA seeks to protect are ger-\nmane to its purpose, given that EIA claims it acts to preserve\nbroad-based athletic participation at JMU and other universi-\nties by seeking judicial invalidation of DOE’s Three-Part\nTest. Further, its suit does not require the participation of its\nindividual members, as EIA seeks declaratory and injunctive\n\f12      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nrelief against DOE’s interpretations and JMU’s actions predi-\ncated thereunder.4 See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343. Finally, EIA has\nmade a sufficient showing that individual members meet the\nconstitutional standing requirements of injury, causation, and\nredressability, as set forth in Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\nat 560-61.\n\n   With regard to injury, the record supports EIA’s allegations\nthat its members include current JMU students who were on\nthe teams eliminated in 20075 as well as female athletes on\ncontinuing teams.6 Moreover, EIA claims that its membership\nbase is broader than students and includes coaches, alumni,\nand fans who assert that their injuries are manifested in denial\nnot only of participation opportunities for athletes, but also of\neconomic and associational opportunities. Because EIA can\ndemonstrate that it has members that were directly affected by\nJMU’s decision to eliminate teams to comply with prong one\nof the DOE’s Three-Part Test, it has sufficiently stated an\ninjury-in-fact. See McCormick, 370 F.3d at 285 (concluding\nthe jurisdictional requirements were met because student ath-\n  4\n     To the extent that EIA seeks to equalize female athletic scholarship\nallocations, EIA has provided affidavits by members assigning their\nclaims to EIA. The Supreme Court has permitted organizational standing\nfor assigned damages claims. Sprint Communications Co., L.P. v. APCC\nServices, Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 288 (2008).\n   5\n     At oral argument, counsel for JMU conceded that several EIA mem-\nbers who were athletes on teams eliminated in 2007 remain enrolled at\nJMU for the 2010-11 academic year.\n   6\n     The district court addressed standing only with respect to EIA’s claim\nregarding the allocation of female athletic scholarships. The court below\nconcluded that EIA lacked standing to pursue this claim against JMU\nbecause it found \"absolutely no indication . . . that EIA’s members include\nfemale athletes on JMU’s existing teams. . . .\" District Court Opinion, 675\nF. Supp. 2d at 684. The district court appears to be mistaken in its review\nof the record. The record includes affidavits from female athletes on exist-\ning teams that would have been affected by scholarship allocation. The\naffidavit of counsel for EIA states that these individuals are EIA members,\nthough the students’ affidavits are silent on this point. J.A. 454.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       13\nlete plaintiffs had not yet graduated and could benefit from\nthe injunctive relief sought).\n\n   Similarly, we find that EIA has set forth allegations suffi-\ncient to support causation and redressability for standing pur-\nposes as to its claims against both DOE and JMU. EIA has\nshown that the injuries suffered by its members were fairly\ntraceable to JMU’s decision to eliminate teams, a decision\nJMU insists it made as part of an effort to comply with prong\none of the DOE’s Three-Part Test and its Title IX obligations.\nEIA contends that DOE’s Three-Part Test caused injury to\nEIA members by inducing educational institutions, including\nJMU, to achieve proportionality by cutting and capping men’s\nathletic teams. As JMU explained, having found compliance\nunder the other two prongs untenable, \"the university was left\nwith the need to comply with the proportionality prong [of the\nThree-Part Test].\" J.A. 344. EIA seeks redress for its mem-\nbers’ injuries in the form of a declaration that the Three-Part\nTest is both substantively and procedurally invalid and an\ninjunction to prevent JMU from maintaining the elimination\nof athletic teams in reliance on DOE’s current interpretations\nof Title IX. Invalidating the Three-Part Test, EIA alleges, will\nredress its members’ injuries by \"restoring the 1975 regula-\ntory standard, under which schools must provide opportunity\n(or ration scarcity) based on relative interest [rather than on\nsubstantial proportionality].\" J.A. 257. Though such an out-\ncome would not necessarily guarantee the restoration of the\nteams that JMU chose to eliminate, no explicit guarantee of\nredress to a plaintiff is required to demonstrate a plaintiff’s\nstanding.\n\n   For example, in National Parks Conservation Ass’n v.\nManson, the D.C. Circuit found that the plaintiff organization\nhad shown redressability where, \"although a federal district\ncourt ruling in favor of National Parks would not directly\ndetermine whether the Roundup Plant will get its permit, the\neffect of such a ruling would not be far removed.\" 414 F.3d\n1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2005). The court there found it sufficient that\n\f14      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nthe court’s decision would \"significantly affect\" plaintiff’s\ninjuries. Id. at 7; see also Massachusetts v. Envtl. Prot.\nAgency, 549 U.S. 497, 526 (2007) (finding the redressability\nrequirement met where the court’s decision would reduce \"to\nsome extent\" plaintiffs’ risk of additional injury); Utah v.\nEvans, 536 U.S. 452, 464 (2002) (noting that \"a significant\nincrease in the likelihood that the plaintiff would obtain relief\nthat directly redresses the injury suffered\" suffices to show\nstanding); Florida Audubon Soc. v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658,\n663-64 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (\"Redressability examines whether\nthe relief sought . . . will likely alleviate the particularized\ninjury alleged by the plaintiff.\") (emphasis added).\n\n   Here, JMU announced that it was relying on the proportion-\nality prong of the Three-Part Test in making the cuts; accord-\ningly, a declaration invalidating the Three-Part Test would\nlikely significantly affect JMU’s decision. More importantly,\nJMU would be bound by the decision of this court. This is not\na case of injury resulting \"from the independent action of\nsome third party not before the court,\" Simon v. Eastern Ken-\ntucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, 42 (1976).\nRather, the regulated party here is also a party to the case,\nand, as such, will be bound by this court’s determination of\nthe validity of the agency’s interpretations as well as the\nnecessity for the school’s actions to comply with such interpreta-\ntions.7 In light of JMU’s reliance on prong one of the DOE’s\n   7\n     In this regard, this case differs from similar cases decided by the D.C.\nCircuit, in which a plaintiff organization sued the Department of Educa-\ntion, challenging the Title IX interpretations as substantively and proce-\ndurally flawed. National Wrestling Coaches Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 366\nF.3d 930 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (hereinafter \"NWCA\"). The court there found\nthat the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue DOE because their injuries were\nnot redressable in a suit against DOE alone, but noted that they might be\nredressable in a suit against the universities. Id. at 936-37; see also Col-\nlege Sports Council v. Dep’t of Educ., 465 F.3d 20, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2006)\n(dismissing on standing grounds), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 821 (2007). Here,\nEIA has sued both DOE and the university. As such, the redressability\nconcerns expressed by the D.C. Circuit in NWCA do not appear. At oral\n\f        EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION                  15\nThree-Part Test and the fact that JMU is a party to this action,\nwe find that EIA has made a sufficient showing to demon-\nstrate standing against both DOE and JMU.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n   We next consider the merits of EIA’s claims. EIA contends\nthat the Three-Part Test is rendered substantively infirm by its\nalleged purposes and effects: \"unlawfully establish[ing] a\ndisparate-impact standard\" and \"unlawfully authoriz[ing]\nintentional discrimination.\" J.A. 286.8 However, because nei-\nther of these contentions has merit, the district court properly\ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss EIA’s substantive chal-\nlenge to the regulations.\n\n                                Title IX\n\n  Under the Three-Part Test, the first benchmark used to\nassess whether an educational institution is \"effectively\naccommodat[ing] the interests and abilities of members of\n\nargument, counsel for DOE conceded that the redressability issue that had\nexisted in earlier cases against DOE alone was not present here because\nEIA had sued both DOE and JMU.\n   Moreover, there is no indication in this case that JMU would have taken\nthe very same action to eliminate specific teams (or that it will maintain\nthe specific eliminations) if the federal regulatory regime EIA attacks here\nwere invalidated. This circumstance further distinguishes this case from\nNWCA. See Emergency Coalition to Defend Educational Travel v. U.S.\nDept. of the Treasury, 545 F.3d 4, 230 (D.C.Cir. 2008) (distinguishing\nNWCA by noting that, \"[T]here was reason to believe that universities\nmight well independently implement the Title IX policy of equalizing\nmale and female athletic resources by eliminating or restricting wrestling\nteams of their own accord, even if the court held that the government regu-\nlations at issue were illegal.\").\n   8\n     Though EIA raises a number of other substantive arguments, e.g., a\nspending clause claim, the district court considered them fully and found\nthem to be without merit, as do we. See District Court Opinion, 675 F.\nSupp. 2d at 672-77.\n\f16     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nboth sexes,\" as required by 45 C.F.R. § 106.41(a), is \"whether\nintercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and\nfemale students are provided in numbers substantially propor-\ntionate to their respective enrollments.\" 44 Fed. Reg. 71, 413,\n71,418. EIA argues that the use of this criterion violates Title\nIX by \"requiring . . . schools where men are more interested\nthan women in athletics . . . to discriminate against male\nstudent-athletes\" and by effectively imposing an \"affirmative\naction requirement\" that mandates preferential treatment for\nwomen. J.A. 287.\n\n   EIA’s argument appears to be based upon the notion that,\nbecause Title IX prohibits intentional discrimination as dispa-\nrate treatment, any implementing regulation that is directed\ntoward disparate impact violates the statute. EIA contends\nthat the Three-Part Test constitutes a disparate impact stan-\ndard that should not be permitted to \"trump\" Title IX’s prohi-\nbition against intentional discrimination, citing the Supreme\nCourt’s recent decision in Ricci v. DeStefano, 129 S. Ct. 2658,\n2675 (2009). However, EIA’s argument both (1) fails to take\ninto account the statutory language that explicitly permits\nconsideration of sex-based disparities in Title IX enforcement\nactions and (2) mischaracterizes the Three-Part Test as a man-\ndatory disparate impact standard.\n\n   EIA fails to acknowledge the clear statutory language of\nTitle IX that allows for some consideration of proportionality\nbetween participation and enrollment. Title IX does not\nrequire proportionality between the percentage of persons of\na particular sex who participate in an activity or program and\nthe percentage of persons of that sex in the community as a\nwhole. The provision at issue reads:\n\n     Nothing contained in subsection (a) of this section\n     shall be interpreted to require any educational insti-\n     tution to grant preferential or disparate treatment to\n     the members of one sex on account of an imbalance\n     which may exist with respect to the total number or\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION         17\n    percentage of persons of that sex participating in or\n    receiving the benefits of any federally supported pro-\n    gram or activity, in comparison with the total num-\n    ber or percentage of persons of that sex in any\n    community, State, section, or other area: Provided,\n    That this subsection shall not be construed to pre-\n    vent the consideration in any hearing or proceeding\n    under this chapter of statistical evidence tending to\n    show that such an imbalance exists with respect to\n    the participation in, or receipt of the benefits of, any\n    such program or activity by the members of one sex.\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1681(b) (emphasis added). However, as the plain\nlanguage of the provision indicates, the statute does not forbid\nseeking such proportionality, and, moreover, as the high-\nlighted language makes clear, the statute expressly allows for\nconsideration of sex-based statistical imbalances in the course\nof enforcement proceedings.\n\n   In Cohen v. Brown University, the First Circuit rejected a\nsimilar challenge to Title IX’s regulations. 101 F.3d 155 (1st\nCir. 1996) (hereinafter \"Cohen II\"). In a suit by female stu-\ndent athletes against the university for failure to comply with\nTitle IX, the university attempted to challenge the substantive\nvalidity of the Three-Part Test. The First Circuit found that\n\"Title IX, like other anti-discrimination schemes, permits an\ninference that a significant gender-based statistical disparity\nmay indicate the existence of discrimination.\" Id. at 170-71\n(finding that Title IX does not ban \"gender-conscious reme-\ndies\"). The Ninth Circuit has also held that Title IX \"does not\nbar remedial actions designed to achieve substantial propor-\ntionality between athletic rosters and student bodies.\" Neal v.\nBd. of Tr. of the Cal. State Univ., 198 F.3d 763, 771 (9th Cir.\n1999). Like the defendants in those cases, EIA here fails to\nshow how the Three-Part Test exceeds the permissive bounds\nof the statute.\n\n   In addition to its failure to take into account the express\nlanguage of Title IX that permits consideration of sex-based\n\f18     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\ndisparities, EIA also misconstrues the nature of the regula-\ntions themselves. EIA contends that DOE’s Three-Part Test\nconstitutes a mandatory disparate impact standard that would\nviolate Title IX. However, this contention is without merit, as\nnumerous courts have held.\n\n   In Kelley v. Bd. of Tr., Univ. of Ill., the Seventh Circuit\nfound that the \"policy interpretation does not, as plaintiffs\nsuggest, mandate statistical balancing. Rather the policy inter-\npretation merely creates a presumption that a school is in\ncompliance with Title IX and the applicable regulation when\nit achieves such a statistical balance.\" 35 F.3d 265, 271 (7th\nCir. 1994). The court in Kelley went on to note that,\n\"[D]espite plaintiffs’ assertions to the contrary, neither the\nregulation nor the policy interpretation run afoul of the dic-\ntates of Title IX.\" Id. at 272. The First Circuit in Cohen II\nechoed this rejection:\n\n     [The University’s] talismanic incantation of \"affir-\n     mative action\" has no legal application to this case\n     and is not helpful to [its] cause. . . . No aspect of the\n     Title IX regime at issue in this case-inclusive of the\n     statute, the relevant regulation, and the pertinent\n     agency documents-mandates gender-based prefer-\n     ences or quotas, or specific timetables for imple-\n     menting numerical goals.\n\n101 F.3d 155, 170 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations omitted).\n\n   Moreover, courts have held that the Three-Part Test pro-\nvides universities with flexibility in achieving statutory com-\npliance. The Ninth Circuit in Neal found:\n\n     Every court, in construing the Policy Interpretation\n     and the text of Title IX, has held that a university\n     may bring itself into Title IX compliance by increas-\n     ing athletic opportunities for the underrepresented\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION        19\n    gender (women in this case) or by decreasing ath-\n    letic opportunities for the overrepresented gender.\n\n198 F.3d at 770. As the First Circuit emphasized in its first\nopinion in Cohen v. Brown University, \"Title IX does not\nrequire that a school pour ever-increasing sums into its ath-\nletic establishment.\" 991 F.2d 888, 898 n. 15 (1st Cir. 1993)\n(hereinafter \"Cohen I\"). The Tenth Circuit further clarified\nthat \"[f]inancially strapped institutions may still comply with\nTitle IX by cutting athletic programs such that men’s and\nwomen’s athletic participation rates become substantially pro-\nportionate to their representation in the undergraduate popula-\ntion.\" Roberts v. Colo. State Bd. of Agric., 998 F.2d 824, 830\n(10th Cir. 1993).\n\n   DOE itself has consistently emphasized that its guidance is\nmeant to provide this kind of flexibility to educational institu-\ntions, explaining that the Three-Part Test \"furnishes an institu-\ntion with three individual avenues to choose from when\ndetermining how it will provide individuals of each sex with\nnondiscriminatory opportunities to participate in intercolle-\ngiate athletics.\" 1996 Clarification, reprinted at J.A. 413. Fur-\nther, \"[i]f a school does not satisfy the ‘substantial\nproportionality’ prong, it would still satisfy the three-prong\ntest if it\" can meet one of the remaining prongs. 2003 Clarifi-\ncation, reprinted at J.A. 425. EIA’s claim that sex-based bal-\nancing for the purposes of achieving participatory\nproportionality violates Title IX has been consistently dis-\nmissed, as has its contention that the Three-Part Test creates\na mandatory disparate impact requirement. Because EIA fails\nto provide support to the contrary, the district court’s dis-\nmissal of this claim was proper.\n\n                       Equal Protection\n\n  EIA also hypothesizes that the Three-Part Test violates the\nequal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by \"re-\nquiring compliance with an enrollment-based quota\" that\n\f20       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n\"serves no government purpose.\" Appellant’s Br. at 40. Rely-\ning on the decisions of the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits,\nthe district court rejected EIA’s argument that the Three-Part\nTest is unconstitutional, stating that \"every appellate court\nthat has considered the constitutionality of the proportionality\nprong of the Three-Part Test has held that it does not offend\nconstitutional principles of equal protection.\" District Court\nOpinion, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 671. The district court’s analysis\nis sound.\n\n     In Kelley, the Seventh Circuit explained,\n\n       While the effect of Title IX and the relevant regula-\n       tion and policy interpretation is that institutions will\n       sometimes consider gender when decreasing their\n       athletic offerings, this limited consideration of sex\n       does not violate the Constitution. . . . There is no\n       doubt but that removing the legacy of sexual\n       discrimination-including discrimination in the provi-\n       sion of extra-curricular offerings such as athletics-\n       from our nation’s educational institutions is an\n       important governmental objective.\n\n35 F.3d at 271-273; see also Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 900-901\n(rejecting Brown University’s equal protection challenge to\nthe Three-Part Test). The Ninth Circuit in Neal adopted the\nreasoning of the First and Seventh Circuits and held that \"the\nconstitutional analysis contained therein persuasively disposes\nof any serious constitutional concerns\" that might be raised\nwith respect to the Three-Part Test. 198 F.3d at 772; see also\nBoulahanis v. Bd. of Regents, 198 F.3d 633, 639 (7th Cir.\n1999) (reiterating Kelley’s holding). EIA’s equal protection\nargument has been widely rejected, and this court finds the\nreasoning of our sister circuits persuasive.\n\n   To counter this overwhelming rejection of its contentions\nby other courts, EIA cites to Parents Involved in Cmty. Sch.\nv. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701 (2007), for the propo-\n\f        EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION                 21\nsition that any attempt to achieve \"balance\" or proportionality\nin the education context is inappropriate. However, as the dis-\ntrict court explained, Parents Involved and other race-based\ncases furnish no support for EIA’s position. Parents Involved\ncentered on race-based school assignments and the strict scru-\ntiny to which racial classifications are subject. 551 U.S. at\n720. The Supreme Court’s analysis in Parents Involved has\nlittle bearing on a case involving sex-based classifications,\nwhich are subject to the lesser standard of intermediate scrutiny.9\nHere, EIA concedes the higher degree of scrutiny applied by\nthe Court in Parents Involved when it notes that the court\nrejected balancing as a \"compelling interest.\" Appellant Br.\n62. It is far from clear that achieving sex equality in college\nathletics is not an important government interest, and EIA\nfails to show otherwise.10 Moreover, the nature of collegiate\nathletics differs from the school assignments at issue in Par-\nents Involved in part because teams are segregated by sex and\nparticipation opportunities are decided in advance. In Neal,\nthe court noted that these differences meant that \"[t]he para-\ndigm that has motivated the Supreme Court’s more recent\n[racial] reverse-discrimination jurisprudence simply does not\nfit the case at bar.\" 198 F.3d at 773 n.8. EIA fails to provide\nany support to the contrary. Accordingly, EIA’s equal protec-\ntion claim, like its claim based on Title IX itself, was properly\ndismissed.\n  9\n    See Adkins v. Rumsfeld, 464 F.3d 456, 468 (4th Cir. 2006) (\"A statute\nthat explicitly classifies people based on sex is subject to intermediate\nscrutiny, which means ‘it must be established at least that the challenged\nclassification serves important governmental objectives and that the dis-\ncriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement\nof those objectives.’\") (quoting Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 60 (2001)).\n   10\n      Seemingly in an effort to move its equal protection claim into the\nrealm of strict scrutiny, EIA attempts to argue that its members’ \"associa-\ntional rights\" under the First Amendment have been harmed by the Three-\nPart Test. However, EIA can cite to no authority for applying First\nAmendment case law in this context. Thus, the district court properly\nrejected this argument. District Court Opinion, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 672-73.\n\f22      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n                                    V.\n\n   EIA also argues that the district court erred in rejecting its\nclaims that publication of the Three-Part Test was procedur-\nally flawed and its efficacy therefore fatally undermined.\nAmong the procedural flaws that EIA complains of are the\nfact that the Three-Part Test did not undergo APA notice and\ncomment review and lacked presidential approval as man-\ndated by Title IX.11 We conclude that the district court prop-\nerly dismissed EIA’s procedural claims.\n\n                     APA Notice and Comment\n\n   EIA claims that DOE’s Three-Part Test is procedurally\ninvalid because neither the 1979 Policy Interpretation nor the\nDOE’s subsequent clarifications underwent the notice and\ncomment procedures prescribed by the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 553.\nThe district court found that neither the 1979 Policy Interpre-\ntation nor the later clarifications were subject to the APA’s\nnotice and comment requirements because they were \"inter-\npretative guidelines\" and \"did not create new rights, impose\nnew obligations, or change the existing law.\" District Court\nOpinion, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 677 (citing Chen Zhou Chai v.\nCarroll, 48 F.3d 1331, 1340 (4th Cir. 1995)).\n  11\n     Though it is somewhat difficult to glean its argument, EIA also\nappears to challenge the procedural validity of the Three-Part Test due to\nHEW’s failure to comply with the \"laying-before\" requirement of the Gen-\neral Education Provisions Act (GEPA), 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)(1). That pro-\nvision required final HEW regulations to be presented to Congress, whose\ndisapproval could prevent the regulation from taking effect. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1232(d)(1). In any event, EIA concedes, albeit inartfully, that HEW\ncarefully considered the requirements imposed by GEPA and found that\nthey did not apply to its 1979 Policy Interpretation. Reply Br. 21. See also\nLetter from Patricia Roberts Harris, Secretary of Health, Education, and\nWelfare, to the Honorable William D. Ford, Chairman, Subcommittee on\nPostsecondary Education, Committee on Education, House of Representa-\ntives (Feb. 11, 1980), reprinted at J.A. 388-89 (explaining HEW’s reason-\ning for not presenting the interpretation to Congress). We find EIA’s\nargument with respect to GEPA to be without merit.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION        23\n   At the time the 1979 Policy Interpretation went into effect,\nthe agency noted that it \"represent[ed] [HEW’s] interpretation\nof the intercollegiate athletic provisions of Title IX . . . and\nits implementing regulation.\" 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (emphasis\nadded). Both the 1979 Policy Interpretation and the subse-\nquent policy clarifications were intended to provide \"addi-\ntional guidance on the requirements for compliance with Title\nIX.\" 44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (emphasis added).\n\n   EIA contends that the 1979 Policy Interpretation and the\nsubsequent clarifications amended the regulations, but it\nutterly fails to provide support for this contention. As the dis-\ntrict court appropriately noted, \"[a]n interpretive guideline\ndoes not ‘become an amendment merely because it supplies\ncrisper and more detailed lines than the authority being inter-\npreted.’\" District Court Opinion, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 677\n(quoting American Mining Congress v. Mine Safety & Health\nAdmin., 995 F.2d 1106, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). In NWCA, the\nD.C. Circuit regarded DOE’s Three-Part Test as \"interpretive\nguidelines that the Department was not obligated to issue in\nthe first place.\" 366 F.3d at 940. As a result, the court there\nfound that the policies were not subject to notice and com-\nment requirements. EIA’s claims regarding procedural flaws\ndue to lack of notice and comment similarly fail here.\n\n                    Presidential Approval\n\n   EIA also contends that the Three-Part Test is procedurally\ninvalid because it was not approved by the President. As\ndescribed in Part I supra, 20 U.S.C. § 1682 provides in part\nthat any \"rule, regulation, or order\" issued by a federal agency\nto effectuate Title IX must be approved by the President in\norder to become effective. Consistent with this requirement,\nPresident Ford signed the Title IX regulations promulgated by\nHEW in 1975. EIA contends that the 1979 Policy Interpreta-\ntion, including the Three-Part Test, is invalid because it\nlacked similar presidential approval. The district court cor-\nrectly rejected this contention as meritless.\n\f24     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n   As with the APA’s notice and comment requirements,\ncourts have held that the requirement of presidential approval\ndoes not apply to the issuance of interpretive guidelines. See,\ne.g., Cohen v. Brown Univ., 879 F. Supp. 185, 199 (D. R.I.\n1995), rev’d in part on other grounds, 101 F.3d 155 (1st Cir.\n1996) (holding that the 1979 Policy Interpretation \"need not\nbe approved by the President in order to become effective,\"\nas it \"is not a rule, regulation, or order\"). EIA’s efforts, more-\nover, to corral the full range of agency action into the catego-\nries that require presidential approval fail to grasp long-\nstanding conceptions of administrative law and are without\nmerit. See, e.g., United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218,\n228 (2001) (noting that \"agencies charged with applying a\nstatute necessarily make all sorts of interpretive choices\"). We\nfind the reasoning of these courts persuasive, and find that\nEIA’s argument with regard to procedural invalidity of the\nThree-Part Test due to lack of presidential approval also fails.\nThe district court properly rejected EIA’s procedural claims,\nand this court finds no reason to disturb that judgment.\n\n                               VI.\n\n   Finally, EIA asserts both state and federal claims against\nJMU. With respect to state law, EIA alleges that JMU vio-\nlated the Virginia Freedom of Information Act by \"working in\nsecret\" to eliminate athletic teams and violated other state\nlaws by making the decision to eliminate teams \"for the\nexpress purpose of attaining enrollment proportionality.\" J.A.\n295. EIA claims JMU violated federal law in the following\nways: (1) that JMU violated the Equal Protection Clause by\neliminating ten athletic teams to comply with the Three-Part\nTest; (2) that JMU violated its members’ substantive and pro-\ncedural due process protections by eliminating the ten teams\nin order to comply with the Three-Part Test; and, finally, (3)\nthat JMU violated Title IX by eliminating ten athletic teams,\nwhich resulted in both a participation and scholarship gap, in\nviolation of the Three-Part Test. The district court properly\n\f        EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION                 25\ndismissed the claims against the JMU defendants, and we\naffirm for the following reasons.\n\n                          State Law Claims\n\n   The district court dismissed EIA’s state law claims as\nbarred by the Eleventh Amendment. The Eleventh Amend-\nment provides that \"the judicial power of the United States\nshall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,\ncommenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by\nCitizens of another State or by Citizens or Subjects of any\nForeign State.\" U.S. Const. amend. XI.12 Courts have held this\nimmunity to extend to \"state agents and state instrumentali-\nties.\" Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.S. 425, 429\n(1997). Though there are several well-established exceptions\nto this jurisdictional bar,13 as the district court noted, \"None\nof the established exceptions . . . permit private citizens to\nbring suit against state officials for injunctive or declaratory\nrelief designed to remedy violations of state law.\" District\nCourt Opinion, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 679. See Pennhurst State\nSchool & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 106 (1984) (hold-\ning an exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity \"inappli-\ncable in a suit against state officials on the basis of state\nlaw\"); see also Antrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 187 (4th Cir.\n  12\n      The Eleventh Amendment, though without express language to this\neffect, has been interpreted to bar suits brought by a citizen against his\nown state. See Bragg v. W. Va. Coal Ass’n, 248 F.3d 275, 291 (4th Cir.\n2001)(citing Litman v. George Mason Univ., 186 F.3d 544, 549 (4th Cir.\n1999); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, (1890)).\n   13\n      See, e.g., Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 59 (1996) (holding\nthat Congress may abrogate a state’s immunity pursuant to its enforcement\npower under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment); Ex parte Young, 209 U.S.\n123 (1908) (holding that the Eleventh Amendment does not prevent pri-\nvate individuals from bringing suit against state officials for prospective\ninjunctive or declaratory relief for ongoing violations of federal law);\nUnited States v. Texas, 143 U.S. 621, 644-45 (1892) (holding that the\nUnited States may bring suit against a state to enforce compliance with\nfederal law).\n\f26      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n2002) (finding that the Ex parte Young exception \"does not\napply to actions against State officials seeking to compel their\ncompliance with State law\").\n\n   To overcome this bar, EIA contends that \"§ 1988(a) ‘feder-\nalizes’ state-law doctrines into EIA’s federal cause of action\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1343 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" Appellant Br.\n25. EIA argues that § 1988(a) incorporates Virginia’s Human\nRights Act into EIA’s § 1983 claim against state officers.\nWithout specifying which elements are missing from the fed-\neral law that state law could provide, EIA maintains that\n\"[s]tate law supplies elements to EIA’s § 1983 claims.\"\nAppellant Br. 25. EIA fails to offer support for this proposition,14\nbut we need not decide the issue here, as it is not squarely\nbefore us. Therefore, we affirm the district court’s dismissal\nof EIA’s state law claims.\n\n                            Equal Protection\n\n   EIA next alleges that JMU’s decision to eliminate certain\nmen’s athletic teams violated the equal protection rights of\nmale athletes with respect to participation. The district court\nrejected this argument, noting that JMU’s \"eliminations were\nmade in an attempt to comply with the requirements of Title\nIX,\" a reason that two other circuit courts had found sufficient\n  14\n     The cases cited by EIA are of no avail. In Bragg v. West Virginia Coal\nAss’n, this court rejected plaintiffs’ argument attempting to enforce federal\nlaw in a suit against state officers. 248 F.3d 275, 295 (4th Cir. 2001) (\"By\ngiving States exclusive regulatory control through enforcement of their\nown approved laws, Congress intended that the federal law establishing\nminimum national standards would \"drop out\" as operative law and that\nthe State laws would become the sole operative law.\"). In Antrican v.\nOdom, this court found that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar plain-\ntiffs’ claim in a suit against state officers enforcing a state Medicaid pro-\ngram, but did so on the grounds that federal standards continued to be\n\"directly applicable.\" 290 F.3d 178, 187-88 (4th Cir. 2002). Neither of\nthese cases is relevant to EIA’s arguments attempting to enforce state law\nagainst state officers or to demonstrate how state law might provide ele-\nments to its federal claims.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       27\nto reject similar claims. District Court Opinion, 675 F. Supp.\n2d at 680 (citing Kelley, 35 F.3d at 272; Miami Univ. Wres-\ntling Club v. Miami Univ., 302 F.3d 608, 614 (6th Cir. 2002)).\n\n   Arguing that the district court’s reliance on the Kelley and\nMiami Univ. Wrestling Club decisions is misplaced, EIA\nappears to contend that, even if the Title IX regulations are\nvalid on their face, JMU’s implementation of them violated\nequal protection. However, EIA fails to provide any support\nfor its as-applied challenge other than to claim that JMU has\nestablished an impermissible quota, a claim that has been\nroundly rejected by other courts, see Part IV.A-B supra.\n\n   In order to survive a motion to dismiss an equal protection\nclaim, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to demonstrate\nplausibly that he was treated differently from others who were\nsimilarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the\nresult of discriminatory animus. Morrison v. Garraghty, 239\nF.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001); see also Bell Atlantic Corp. v.\nTwombly, 550 U.S. 544, 560-61 (2007). Here, EIA has failed\nto make sufficient allegations with respect to either element.\n\n   Other courts have relied on the intent element to dismiss\nsimilar claims in the past. In Miami Univ. Wrestling Club, the\nEighth Circuit noted, \"Only if Title IX, its regulations or the\nPolicy Interpretation are unconstitutional . . . could we hold\nthat Miami’s compliance with the law and the regulations is\nunconstitutional.\" 302 F.3d at 614. Here, JMU made its deci-\nsion to cut the teams in order to comply with the Three-Part\nTest. As such, EIA fails to plead facts plausibly identifying\nany discriminatory intent on the part of the university decision\nmakers.\n\n   Moreover, to avoid dismissal of its claim, EIA must plead\nsufficient facts to show, plausibly, that JMU treated male ath-\nletes differently from female athletes. While JMU relied on\nsex in making its decision about which teams to cut, its efforts\nwere an attempt to bring athletic participation in line with the\n\f28     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nstudent body population. As such, although more male ath-\nletes might have been affected by the cuts, the result was to\nensure that the student body as a whole was \"substantially\nequally\" represented in the availability of opportunities for\nathletic participation.\n\n   EIA argues that the student body is not the appropriate pool\nagainst which to compare athletic participation; rather, it con-\ntends such comparisons should be made with respect to inter-\nest. However, in affirming the district court’s denial of EIA’s\nmotion for preliminary injunction, we found that \"[c]ourts\nhave consistently rejected EIA’s underlying claim that equal\nopportunity under § 86.41 should be tied to expressed interest\nrather than actual participation.\" Equity in Athletics, 291 Fed.\nAppx. at 523. We unhesitatingly make clear our endorsement\nof this principle. As the First Circuit explained in Cohen II,\n\"[i]nterest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum; they evolve\nas a function of opportunity and experience.\" 101 F.3d at 179.\nSee also Neal, 198 F.3d at 767 (finding that an approach that\nties interest to opportunity is \"fundamentally inconsistent with\nthe purpose of Title IX\"). EIA’s attempts to shift the focus of\nthis long-standing inquiry into proportionality are unpersua-\nsive.\n\n   Because EIA fails to provide any support for its equal pro-\ntection challenge to JMU’s decision to eliminate ten athletic\nteams, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of that claim.\n\n                          Due Process\n\n   EIA also claims that JMU violated the substantive and pro-\ncedural due process rights of the student-athletes on the teams\nchosen for elimination. However, because EIA fails to iden-\ntify a specific liberty or property interest that student-athletes\nwere deprived of as a result of JMU’s actions, we affirm the\ndistrict court’s dismissal of this claim.\n\n  In order to make out either a substantive or procedural due\nprocess claim, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to sup-\n\f        EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION                29\nport a finding that the student-athletes \"were deprived of life,\nliberty, or property, by governmental action.\" Beverati v.\nSmith, 120 F.3d 500, 502 (4th Cir. 1997). A protected prop-\nerty interest cannot be created by the Fourteenth Amendment\nitself, but rather must be created or defined by an independent\nsource. See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972);\nTri-County Paving, Inc. v. Ashe County, 281 F.3d 430, 436\n(4th Cir. 2002). In order to have a property interest in a bene-\nfit, a person must have more than a mere \"unilateral expecta-\ntion of it\" or \"abstract need or desire for it.\" See Roth, 408\nU.S. at 577.\n\n   The district court found that EIA failed to offer any support\nfor its claim that a property interest in \"continued participa-\ntion in intercollegiate athletics exists\" under state law. District\nCourt Opinion, 675 F. Supp. 2d at 680. As the district court\nnoted, other courts have addressed this issue and have consis-\ntently held that \"the interest of the student athletes in partici-\npating in intercollegiate sports was not constitutionally\nprotected.\" Colo. Seminary v. Nat’l Collegiate Athletic Ass’n,\n570 F.2d 320, 321 (10th Cir. 1978); see also Neosho Cmty.\nColl., 741 F. Supp. 854, 861 (D. Kan. 1990). On appeal, EIA\nchallenges the district court’s conclusion, but the cases it cites\nare inapposite, relying, by and large, on contract theories.\nThough individual athletes could have contract claims with\nrespect to lost scholarships,15 EIA fails to show how these\ncases have established a property interest in intercollegiate\nathletic participation.\n\n   EIA fails both to address this long-standing body of prece-\ndent in its briefs and to provide support for its preferred out-\ncome. Accordingly, we conclude the district court properly\ndismissed EIA’s due process claims against JMU.\n  15\n    This issue is not before the court, as EIA makes no due process claims\nwith respect to lost scholarships; JMU did not eliminate scholarships for\nathletes on the teams that were cut.\n\f30     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n                            Title IX\n\n   EIA argues in the alternative that JMU’s actions violated\nthe Three-Part Test and Title IX in that JMU \"overdid its\nelimination of male athletes.\" Appellant’s Br. 70. EIA alleges\nthat in the 2007-08 academic year, as a result of JMU’s cuts,\n\"men became the under-represented gender in JMU athletics,\nby 2%, which represents 17 male athletic slots.\" Appellant’s\nBr. 17. Because of this lack of exact proportionality, EIA\nclaims, JMU ultimately \"violat[ed] the Three-Part Test to the\nextent that it has any lawful effect.\" J.A. 296. This contention\nmisses the mark.\n\n   According to figures submitted by EIA, men made up\n39.1% of JMU’s undergraduate population, but only 37.1% of\nthe university’s athletes in 2007-08. J.A. 455. However,\nEIA’s figures are inconsistent with those collected by DOE.\nContrary to EIA’s assertions, the record demonstrates that, for\nthe 2007-08 academic year, 37.98% of athletic spots at JMU\nwere allocated to men (320 female athletic slots and 196 male\nathletic slots), whereas men constituted 39.13% of the total\nstudent body (10,608 women and 6,820 men). J.A. 311. Based\non these figures, men were only \"underrepresented\" by\n1.15%, and not two percent as claimed by EIA.\n\n   Notwithstanding EIA’s mistaken calculations, the district\ncourt correctly noted that the gap created by JMU’s attempts\nto comply with the proportionality prong of the Three-Part\nTest, regardless of whether it was one or two percent, was\ninsufficient by itself to establish a violation under Title IX, as\nthe DOE has expressly noted that determinations of what con-\nstitutes \"substantially proportionate\" under the first prong of\nthe Three-Part Test should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n1996 Clarification, reprinted at J.A. 415 (\"Because this deter-\nmination [of substantial proportionality] depends on the insti-\ntution’s specific circumstances and the size of its athletic\nprogram, [DOE] makes this determination on a case-by-case\nbasis, rather than through use of a statistical test.\"). Moreover,\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION        31\nas the district court noted, other courts that have addressed the\nissue have found educational institutions to be in compliance\nwith Title IX where the sex disparity was similar to that\nalleged by EIA. See, e.g., Boulahanis, 198 F.3d at 639 (find-\ning substantial proportionality where the number of male ath-\nletes was within three percentage points of enrollment\nfollowing the elimination of men’s soccer and wrestling);\nMiami Univ. Wrestling Club, 302 F.3d at 614 (noting success-\nful Title IX compliance where the number of female athletes\nwas within two percentage points of the number of female\nstudents).\n\n  EIA provides no support for its contention that a disparity\nas low as 2% (and, according to the record, not much above\n1%) is substantially disproportionate as a matter of law. As\nsuch, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of this claim.\n\n   EIA also alleges that JMU created \"a further and larger\nadmitted gap in scholarship proportionality\" as a result of its\ncuts, in violation of DOE policies. Appellant’s Br. at 73.\nClaiming that the difference in athletic participation created\nan 11.94% disparity between male and female athletic schol-\narships, EIA contends that \"JMU was $1.3 million away from\nhaving its female scholarships fall within 1.0 percent of\nwomen’s athletic participation.\" Id. EIA calls for retroactive\npayments under Title IX, arguing that JMU’s cuts created this\ndisparity. Though the district court failed to reach the merits\nof this claim, it is plain that EIA’s argument fails for several\nreasons.\n\n   First, EIA cites to no authority for the proposition that a\nscholarship allocation disparity of no more than one percent\nis required by DOE policy. As with the participation gap,\nDOE has not specified a magic number at which substantial\nproportionality is achieved. See 1996 Clarification, reprinted\nat J.A. 415 (noting, in the course of discussing participation\nopportunities, that \"in some circumstances it may be unrea-\nsonable to expect an institution to achieve exact proportional-\n\f32      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nity\"). Second, EIA fails to address whether and how this gap\nhas changed in the years since the initial cuts were made.\nThere is no dispute that some of the scholarship funds in\n2007-08 went to \"pay scholarships to former athletes on dis-\ncontinued teams.\" Reply Br. 38. However, that need would\nhave been eliminated as those students graduated, no doubt\nreducing the scholarship gap created after the cuts were ini-\ntially made.\n\n   Finally, while the 11.94% disparity in scholarship alloca-\ntion cited by EIA appears more substantial than the participa-\ntion gap, the figure is based on the number of athletic slots at\nJMU, and not the number of individual athletes. For the 2007-\n08 academic year, for example, whereas each male athlete\nparticipated on only one team, a number of women athletes\nparticipated on more than one team such that there were actu-\nally only 240 individual female athletes compared to 196\nmale athletes. J.A. 311-313. Based on the 240 actual female\nathletes—as opposed to female athletic slots—at JMU,\nwomen only received 4.10% fewer scholarship dollars than\nmen.16 When calculated using individual athletes, the scholar-\nship gap is substantially smaller than that claimed by EIA.\n\n                                  VII.\n\n   The district court’s dismissal of EIA’s constitutional, statu-\ntory, and procedural claims against DOE and JMU was\nentirely proper. Accordingly, the judgment of the district\ncourt is\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED.\n  16\n     According to statistics collected by DOE for 2007-08, female athletic\nteams received 50.94% of athletics-related student aid at JMU. J.A. 313.\nBased on the actual number of female athletes (240) and not female ath-\nletic slots (320), female athletes represented 55.04% of the total student\nathletes at JMU in 2007-08. J.A. 311. 55.04% – 50.94% = 4.10%.\n\f",

Plaintiff-Appellant Equity in Athletics,\nInc. (EIA), a membership organization comprised of student-\nathletes, coaches, parents, alumni, and fans, is a not-for-profit\nVirginia nonstock corporation. In this lawsuit seeking declara-\ntory and injunctive relief, EIA challenges the Department of\nEducation’s (DOE) interpretative guidelines implementing the\nequal opportunity mandate of Title IX of the Education\nAmendments of 1972, Pub. L. 92-318, 86 Stat. 373, 20 U.S.C.\n§§ 1681-88 (Title IX). EIA alleges that the guidelines violate\nTitle IX, the U.S. Constitution, and the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § § 551 et seq. EIA also seeks relief\nagainst James Madison University (JMU), challenging JMU’s\n2006 decision to eliminate ten of the university’s varsity ath-\nletic teams (seven men’s teams and three women’s teams), on\nthe grounds that the elimination of those teams violates Title\nIX, the U.S. Constitution, and Virginia law. The district court\n\f         EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION                    5\ngranted defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the case;\nEIA has noted a timely appeal. For the reasons that follow, we\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n                                      I.\n\n   We begin with a brief review of the statutory and regula-\ntory background relevant to this case.\n\n   In 1972, Congress enacted Title IX, which provides in part\nthat \"[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of\nsex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits\nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any education pro-\ngram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" 20\nU.S.C. § 1681. Title IX did not specifically address its appli-\ncation to athletics, and in 1974, Congress enacted the Javits\nAmendment, which directed the Secretary of Health, Educa-\ntion, and Welfare (\"HEW\") to \"prepare and publish . . . pro-\nposed regulations which shall include with respect to\nintercollegiate athletic activities reasonable provisions consid-\nering the nature of particular sports.\" Education Amendments\nof 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-380, § 844 (1974) (Javits Amend-\nment).\n\n   On June 20, 1974, HEW published its proposed regulations\nimplementing Title IX, containing provisions that addressed\nthe statute’s application to athletic programs. 39 Fed. Reg.\n22,227, 22,236 (June 20, 1974). HEW followed notice and\ncomment rulemaking procedures, and President Ford\napproved the final regulations, as required by Title IX, 20\nU.S.C. § 1682.1 Effective July 21, 1975, the regulations pro-\n  1\n    The relevant portion of the provision reads: \"Each Federal department\nand agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to\nany education program or activity . . . is authorized and directed to effectu-\nate the provisions of section 1681 of this title with respect to such program\nor activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability\nwhich shall be consistent with achievement of the objectives of the statute\nauthorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action is\ntaken. No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and\nuntil approved by the President.\" 20 U.S.C. § 1682.\n\f6      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nvided in part that \"[a] recipient which operates or sponsors\ninterscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics\nshall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both\nsexes.\" 45 C.F.R. § 86.41(c). One of the ten factors used to\ndetermine equality of opportunity is \"[w]hether the selection\nof sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate\nthe interests and abilities of members of both sexes.\" Id.\n\n   In December 1978, HEW issued a Proposed Policy Inter-\npretation to provide further guidance for the 1975 regulations.\n43 Fed. Reg. 58,070 (Dec. 11, 1978). After receiving numer-\nous comments in response to its proposed interpretation,\nHEW issued a Final Policy Interpretation in December 1979.\n44 Fed. Reg. 71,413 (Dec. 11, 1979). The Policy Interpreta-\ntion aimed to supply guidance to educational institutions to\n\"effectively accommodat[e] the interests and abilities of male\nand female athletes\" and provided that compliance would be\nassessed \"in any one of the following ways\":\n\n       (1) Whether intercollegiate level participation\n    opportunities for male and female students are pro-\n    vided in numbers substantially proportionate to their\n    respective enrollments; or\n\n       (2) Where the members of one sex have been and\n    are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes,\n    whether the institution can show a history and con-\n    tinuing practice of program expansion which is\n    demonstrably responsive to the developing interest\n    and abilities of the members of that sex; or\n\n       (3) Where the members of one sex are underrepre-\n    sented among intercollegiate athletes and the institu-\n    tion cannot show a continuing practice of program\n    expansion such as that cited above, whether it can be\n    demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the\n    members of that sex have been fully and effectively\n    accommodated by the present program.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       7\nId. at 71,418. This provision has come to be known as the\n\"Three-Part Test,\" and its first prong is at the heart of EIA’s\nclaims in this case against DOE and JMU.\n\n   In 1979, Congress split HEW into the Department of\nHealth and Human Services and the Department of Education.\nSee Department of Education Organization Act, 20 U.S.C.\n§ § 3401-3510, Pub. L. 96-88 (1979). As part of that reorgani-\nzation, HEW’s functions with respect to educational programs\nwere transferred to the Department of Education. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 3441(a)(3) (transferring to DOE all functions of HEW’s\nOffice of Civil Rights, \"which relate to functions transferred\nby this section\"); see also N.

On September 29,\n2006, JMU announced its plan to eliminate seven men’s and\nthree women’s athletic teams in order to bring its intercolle-\ngiate athletic program into compliance with Title IX.2 In a\npress release issued following its decision, JMU noted that, as\nof the 2006 fall semester, although women represented 61%\nof the undergraduate student body, they constituted only\n50.7% of the varsity intercollegiate athletes. The press release\nwent on to announce that the proposed cuts would yield a\nfemale athletic participation rate of 61%, a figure that would\nalign more closely with female student enrollment.\n\n  In explaining its decision to eliminate the designated teams,\nJMU stated that \"[a]lternatives were proposed, considered,\nand analyzed to deal with the need to come into compliance\nwith Title IX,\" but ultimately, \"the university was left with the\n    2\n   JMU is a state-sponsored university in Virginia that has received and\ncontinues to receive federal funds.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       9\nneed to comply with the proportionality prong [of the Three-\nPart Test].\" J.A. 344. The university found that compliance\nunder either of the two other prongs of the Three-Part Test\nwas untenable. With respect to the second prong of the Test,\nJMU determined that it could not demonstrate a history or\ncontinuing pattern of program expansion to accommodate the\nneeds of the under-represented sex, having added only one\nwomen’s sport since 1990. JMU also found it could not com-\nply with the third prong of accommodating unmet student\ninterest, as \"[a]ny solution that would require the addition of\nsports beyond the current 28 teams was deemed unaccept-\nable.\" J.A. 344. As the university explained, \"The primary\nreason for the decision was to bring JMU into compliance\nwith the law.\" J.A. 344. The proposed team eliminations took\neffect on July 1, 2007.\n\n   Meanwhile, opponents of JMU’s decision incorporated EIA\non February 5, 2007 in order to challenge JMU’s proposed\ncuts. On March 19, 2007, EIA filed this action against DOE,\nthe Secretary of Education, the Assistant Secretary for Civil\nRights, and the United States (\"federal defendants\"), challeng-\ning Title IX’s interpretive guidelines. In particular, EIA\nasserted that DOE’s 1979 Policy Interpretation, i.e., the\nThree-Part Test, and its subsequent Policy Clarifications vio-\nlated Title IX, the U.S. Constitution, and the APA. At about\nthe time it filed suit against the federal defendants, EIA\nrequested that JMU defer its proposed elimination of the ten\nteams and, when JMU refused, EIA amended its complaint to\njoin JMU and numerous JMU officials as defendants. EIA’s\ncomplaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would\ninvalidate the allegedly unlawful guidelines and forestall\nJMU’s proposed team eliminations. In the alternative, EIA\nsought damages under Title IX to compel JMU to equalize\nscholarship payments to student-athletes affected by the\nalleged scholarship gap created by JMU’s decision to elimi-\nnate teams.\n\f10      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v.

The federal\ndefendants challenge EIA’s standing to bring this suit, argu-\ning that the underlying injury of which it complains could be\nredressed only by the university. JMU, on the other hand,\ncontends that EIA’s membership does not include female ath-\nletes on existing teams; it thus argues that EIA lacks standing\nto challenge the university’s scholarship allocation. JMU does\nnot contest EIA’s standing with respect to its other claims.\n  3\n    The district court had before it EIA’s motion for summary judgment\nunder Fed. R. Civ.

It appears\nuncontested that the interests EIA seeks to protect are ger-\nmane to its purpose, given that EIA claims it acts to preserve\nbroad-based athletic participation at JMU and other universi-\nties by seeking judicial invalidation of DOE’s Three-Part\nTest. Further, its suit does not require the participation of its\nindividual members, as EIA seeks declaratory and injunctive\n\f12      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nrelief against DOE’s interpretations and JMU’s actions predi-\ncated thereunder.4 See Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343. Finally, EIA has\nmade a sufficient showing that individual members meet the\nconstitutional standing requirements of injury, causation, and\nredressability, as set forth in Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S.\nat 560-61.\n\n   With regard to injury, the record supports EIA’s allegations\nthat its members include current JMU students who were on\nthe teams eliminated in 20075 as well as female athletes on\ncontinuing teams.6 Moreover, EIA claims that its membership\nbase is broader than students and includes coaches, alumni,\nand fans who assert that their injuries are manifested in denial\nnot only of participation opportunities for athletes, but also of\neconomic and associational opportunities. Because EIA can\ndemonstrate that it has members that were directly affected by\nJMU’s decision to eliminate teams to comply with prong one\nof the DOE’s Three-Part Test, it has sufficiently stated an\ninjury-in-fact.

The court below\nconcluded that EIA lacked standing to pursue this claim against JMU\nbecause it found \"absolutely no indication . . . that EIA’s members include\nfemale athletes on JMU’s existing teams. . . .\" District Court Opinion, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

The record includes affidavits from female athletes on exist-\ning teams that would have been affected by scholarship allocation. The\naffidavit of counsel for EIA states that these individuals are EIA members,\nthough the students’ affidavits are silent on this point. J.A. 454.\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION       13\nlete plaintiffs had not yet graduated and could benefit from\nthe injunctive relief sought).\n\n   Similarly, we find that EIA has set forth allegations suffi-\ncient to support causation and redressability for standing pur-\nposes as to its claims against both DOE and JMU. EIA has\nshown that the injuries suffered by its members were fairly\ntraceable to JMU’s decision to eliminate teams, a decision\nJMU insists it made as part of an effort to comply with prong\none of the DOE’s Three-Part Test and its Title IX obligations.\nEIA contends that DOE’s Three-Part Test caused injury to\nEIA members by inducing educational institutions, including\nJMU, to achieve proportionality by cutting and capping men’s\nathletic teams. As JMU explained, having found compliance\nunder the other two prongs untenable, \"the university was left\nwith the need to comply with the proportionality prong [of the\nThree-Part Test].\" J.A. 344. EIA seeks redress for its mem-\nbers’ injuries in the form of a declaration that the Three-Part\nTest is both substantively and procedurally invalid and an\ninjunction to prevent JMU from maintaining the elimination\nof athletic teams in reliance on DOE’s current interpretations\nof Title IX. Invalidating the Three-Part Test, EIA alleges, will\nredress its members’ injuries by \"restoring the 1975 regula-\ntory standard, under which schools must provide opportunity\n(or ration scarcity) based on relative interest [rather than on\nsubstantial proportionality].\" J.A. 257. Though such an out-\ncome would not necessarily guarantee the restoration of the\nteams that JMU chose to eliminate, no explicit guarantee of\nredress to a plaintiff is required to demonstrate a plaintiff’s\nstanding.\n\n   For example, in National Parks Conservation Ass’n v.\nManson, the D.C. Circuit found that the plaintiff organization\nhad shown redressability where, \"although a federal district\ncourt ruling in favor of National Parks would not directly\ndetermine whether the Roundup Plant will get its permit, the\neffect of such a ruling would not be far removed.\" </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186518\"><a href=\"/opinion/186518/natl-parks-consrvtn-v-manson-craig/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (D.C.

However, EIA’s argument both (1) fails to take\ninto account the statutory language that explicitly permits\nconsideration of sex-based disparities in Title IX enforcement\nactions and (2) mischaracterizes the Three-Part Test as a man-\ndatory disparate impact standard.\n\n   EIA fails to acknowledge the clear statutory language of\nTitle IX that allows for some consideration of proportionality\nbetween participation and enrollment. Title IX does not\nrequire proportionality between the percentage of persons of\na particular sex who participate in an activity or program and\nthe percentage of persons of that sex in the community as a\nwhole. The provision at issue reads:\n\n     Nothing contained in subsection (a) of this section\n     shall be interpreted to require any educational insti-\n     tution to grant preferential or disparate treatment to\n     the members of one sex on account of an imbalance\n     which may exist with respect to the total number or\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v.

However, as the plain\nlanguage of the provision indicates, the statute does not forbid\nseeking such proportionality, and, moreover, as the high-\nlighted language makes clear, the statute expressly allows for\nconsideration of sex-based statistical imbalances in the course\nof enforcement proceedings.\n\n   In Cohen v. Brown University, the First Circuit rejected a\nsimilar challenge to Title IX’s regulations. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729930\"><a href=\"/opinion/729930/amy-cohen-v-brown-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\nCir. 1996) (hereinafter \"Cohen II\"). In a suit by female stu-\ndent athletes against the university for failure to comply with\nTitle IX, the university attempted to challenge the substantive\nvalidity of the Three-Part Test.

EIA contends that DOE’s Three-Part Test\nconstitutes a mandatory disparate impact standard that would\nviolate Title IX. However, this contention is without merit, as\nnumerous courts have held.\n\n   In Kelley v. Bd. of Tr., Univ. of Ill., the Seventh Circuit\nfound that the \"policy interpretation does not, as plaintiffs\nsuggest, mandate statistical balancing.

EIA’s claim that sex-based bal-\nancing for the purposes of achieving participatory\nproportionality violates Title IX has been consistently dis-\nmissed, as has its contention that the Three-Part Test creates\na mandatory disparate impact requirement. Because EIA fails\nto provide support to the contrary, the district court’s dis-\nmissal of this claim was proper.\n\n                       Equal Protection\n\n  EIA also hypothesizes that the Three-Part Test violates the\nequal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by \"re-\nquiring compliance with an enrollment-based quota\" that\n\f20       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v.

Rely-\ning on the decisions of the First, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits,\nthe district court rejected EIA’s argument that the Three-Part\nTest is unconstitutional, stating that \"every appellate court\nthat has considered the constitutionality of the proportionality\nprong of the Three-Part Test has held that it does not offend\nconstitutional principles of equal protection.\" District Court\nOpinion, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court’s analysis\nis sound.\n\n     In Kelley, the Seventh Circuit explained,\n\n       While the effect of Title IX and the relevant regula-\n       tion and policy interpretation is that institutions will\n       sometimes consider gender when decreasing their\n       athletic offerings, this limited consideration of sex\n       does not violate the Constitution. . . . There is no\n       doubt but that removing the legacy of sexual\n       discrimination-including discrimination in the provi-\n       sion of extra-curricular offerings such as athletics-\n       from our nation’s educational institutions is an\n       important governmental objective.\n\n35 F.3d at 271-273; see also Cohen I, 991 F.2d at 900-901\n(rejecting Brown University’s equal protection challenge to\nthe Three-Part Test). The Ninth Circuit in Neal adopted the\nreasoning of the First and Seventh Circuits and held that \"the\nconstitutional analysis contained therein persuasively disposes\nof any serious constitutional concerns\" that might be raised\nwith respect to the Three-Part Test. 198 F.3d at 772; see also\nBoulahanis v.

However, as the dis-\ntrict court explained, Parents Involved and other race-based\ncases furnish no support for EIA’s position. Parents Involved\ncentered on race-based school assignments and the strict scru-\ntiny to which racial classifications are subject. 551 U.S. at\n720. The Supreme Court’s analysis in Parents Involved has\nlittle bearing on a case involving sex-based classifications,\nwhich are subject to the lesser standard of intermediate scrutiny.9\nHere, EIA concedes the higher degree of scrutiny applied by\nthe Court in Parents Involved when it notes that the court\nrejected balancing as a \"compelling interest.\" Appellant Br.\n62. It is far from clear that achieving sex equality in college\nathletics is not an important government interest, and EIA\nfails to show otherwise.10 Moreover, the nature of collegiate\nathletics differs from the school assignments at issue in Par-\nents Involved in part because teams are segregated by sex and\nparticipation opportunities are decided in advance. In Neal,\nthe court noted that these differences meant that \"[t]he para-\ndigm that has motivated the Supreme Court’s more recent\n[racial] reverse-discrimination jurisprudence simply does not\nfit the case at bar.\" 198 F.3d at 773 n.8. EIA fails to provide\nany support to the contrary. Accordingly, EIA’s equal protec-\ntion claim, like its claim based on Title IX itself, was properly\ndismissed.\n  9\n    See Adkins v.

That pro-\nvision required final HEW regulations to be presented to Congress, whose\ndisapproval could prevent the regulation from taking effect. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1232(d)(1).

Wrestling Club decisions is misplaced, EIA\nappears to contend that, even if the Title IX regulations are\nvalid on their face, JMU’s implementation of them violated\nequal protection. However, EIA fails to provide any support\nfor its as-applied challenge other than to claim that JMU has\nestablished an impermissible quota, a claim that has been\nroundly rejected by other courts, see Part IV.A-B supra.\n\n   In order to survive a motion to dismiss an equal protection\nclaim, a plaintiff must plead sufficient facts to demonstrate\nplausibly that he was treated differently from others who were\nsimilarly situated and that the unequal treatment was the\nresult of discriminatory animus.

Here, EIA has failed\nto make sufficient allegations with respect to either element.\n\n   Other courts have relied on the intent element to dismiss\nsimilar claims in the past. In Miami Univ. Wrestling Club, the\nEighth Circuit noted, \"Only if Title IX, its regulations or the\nPolicy Interpretation are unconstitutional . . . could we hold\nthat Miami’s compliance with the law and the regulations is\nunconstitutional.\" 302 F.3d at 614. Here, JMU made its deci-\nsion to cut the teams in order to comply with the Three-Part\nTest. As such, EIA fails to plead facts plausibly identifying\nany discriminatory intent on the part of the university decision\nmakers.\n\n   Moreover, to avoid dismissal of its claim, EIA must plead\nsufficient facts to show, plausibly, that JMU treated male ath-\nletes differently from female athletes. While JMU relied on\nsex in making its decision about which teams to cut, its efforts\nwere an attempt to bring athletic participation in line with the\n\f28     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nstudent body population. As such, although more male ath-\nletes might have been affected by the cuts, the result was to\nensure that the student body as a whole was \"substantially\nequally\" represented in the availability of opportunities for\nathletic participation.\n\n   EIA argues that the student body is not the appropriate pool\nagainst which to compare athletic participation; rather, it con-\ntends such comparisons should be made with respect to inter-\nest. However, in affirming the district court’s denial of EIA’s\nmotion for preliminary injunction, we found that \"[c]ourts\nhave consistently rejected EIA’s underlying claim that equal\nopportunity under § 86.41 should be tied to expressed interest\nrather than actual participation.\" Equity in Athletics, 291 Fed.\nAppx. at 523. We unhesitatingly make clear our endorsement\nof this principle. As the First Circuit explained in Cohen II,\n\"[i]nterest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum; they evolve\nas a function of opportunity and experience.\" 101 F.3d at 179.\nSee also Neal, 198 F.3d at 767 (finding that an approach that\nties interest to opportunity is \"fundamentally inconsistent with\nthe purpose of Title IX\"). EIA’s attempts to shift the focus of\nthis long-standing inquiry into proportionality are unpersua-\nsive.\n\n   Because EIA fails to provide any support for its equal pro-\ntection challenge to JMU’s decision to eliminate ten athletic\nteams, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of that claim.\n\n                          Due Process\n\n   EIA also claims that JMU violated the substantive and pro-\ncedural due process rights of the student-athletes on the teams\nchosen for elimination. However, because EIA fails to iden-\ntify a specific liberty or property interest that student-athletes\nwere deprived of as a result of JMU’s actions, we affirm the\ndistrict court’s dismissal of this claim.\n\n  In order to make out either a substantive or procedural due\nprocess claim, a plaintiff must allege sufficient facts to sup-\n\f        EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v.

On appeal, EIA\nchallenges the district court’s conclusion, but the cases it cites\nare inapposite, relying, by and large, on contract theories.\nThough individual athletes could have contract claims with\nrespect to lost scholarships,15 EIA fails to show how these\ncases have established a property interest in intercollegiate\nathletic participation.\n\n   EIA fails both to address this long-standing body of prece-\ndent in its briefs and to provide support for its preferred out-\ncome. Accordingly, we conclude the district court properly\ndismissed EIA’s due process claims against JMU.\n  15\n    This issue is not before the court, as EIA makes no due process claims\nwith respect to lost scholarships; JMU did not eliminate scholarships for\nathletes on the teams that were cut.\n\f30     EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\n                            Title IX\n\n   EIA argues in the alternative that JMU’s actions violated\nthe Three-Part Test and Title IX in that JMU \"overdid its\nelimination of male athletes.\" Appellant’s Br. 70. EIA alleges\nthat in the 2007-08 academic year, as a result of JMU’s cuts,\n\"men became the under-represented gender in JMU athletics,\nby 2%, which represents 17 male athletic slots.\" Appellant’s\nBr. 17. Because of this lack of exact proportionality, EIA\nclaims, JMU ultimately \"violat[ed] the Three-Part Test to the\nextent that it has any lawful effect.\" J.A. 296. This contention\nmisses the mark.\n\n   According to figures submitted by EIA, men made up\n39.1% of JMU’s undergraduate population, but only 37.1% of\nthe university’s athletes in 2007-08. J.A. 455. However,\nEIA’s figures are inconsistent with those collected by DOE.\nContrary to EIA’s assertions, the record demonstrates that, for\nthe 2007-08 academic year, 37.98% of athletic spots at JMU\nwere allocated to men (320 female athletic slots and 196 male\nathletic slots), whereas men constituted 39.13% of the total\nstudent body (10,608 women and 6,820 men). J.A. 311. Based\non these figures, men were only \"underrepresented\" by\n1.15%, and not two percent as claimed by EIA.\n\n   Notwithstanding EIA’s mistaken calculations, the district\ncourt correctly noted that the gap created by JMU’s attempts\nto comply with the proportionality prong of the Three-Part\nTest, regardless of whether it was one or two percent, was\ninsufficient by itself to establish a violation under Title IX, as\nthe DOE has expressly noted that determinations of what con-\nstitutes \"substantially proportionate\" under the first prong of\nthe Three-Part Test should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n1996 Clarification, reprinted at J.A. 415 (\"Because this deter-\nmination [of substantial proportionality] depends on the insti-\ntution’s specific circumstances and the size of its athletic\nprogram, [DOE] makes this determination on a case-by-case\nbasis, rather than through use of a statistical test.\"). Moreover,\n\f       EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION        31\nas the district court noted, other courts that have addressed the\nissue have found educational institutions to be in compliance\nwith Title IX where the sex disparity was similar to that\nalleged by EIA. See, e.g., Boulahanis, 198 F.3d at 639 (find-\ning substantial proportionality where the number of male ath-\nletes was within three percentage points of enrollment\nfollowing the elimination of men’s soccer and wrestling);\nMiami Univ. Wrestling Club, 302 F.3d at 614 (noting success-\nful Title IX compliance where the number of female athletes\nwas within two percentage points of the number of female\nstudents).\n\n  EIA provides no support for its contention that a disparity\nas low as 2% (and, according to the record, not much above\n1%) is substantially disproportionate as a matter of law. As\nsuch, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of this claim.\n\n   EIA also alleges that JMU created \"a further and larger\nadmitted gap in scholarship proportionality\" as a result of its\ncuts, in violation of DOE policies. Appellant’s Br. at 73.\nClaiming that the difference in athletic participation created\nan 11.94% disparity between male and female athletic schol-\narships, EIA contends that \"JMU was $1.3 million away from\nhaving its female scholarships fall within 1.0 percent of\nwomen’s athletic participation.\" Id. EIA calls for retroactive\npayments under Title IX, arguing that JMU’s cuts created this\ndisparity. Though the district court failed to reach the merits\nof this claim, it is plain that EIA’s argument fails for several\nreasons.\n\n   First, EIA cites to no authority for the proposition that a\nscholarship allocation disparity of no more than one percent\nis required by DOE policy. As with the participation gap,\nDOE has not specified a magic number at which substantial\nproportionality is achieved. See 1996 Clarification, reprinted\nat J.A. 415 (noting, in the course of discussing participation\nopportunities, that \"in some circumstances it may be unrea-\nsonable to expect an institution to achieve exact proportional-\n\f32      EQUITY IN ATHLETICS, v. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION\nity\"). Second, EIA fails to address whether and how this gap\nhas changed in the years since the initial cuts were made.\nThere is no dispute that some of the scholarship funds in\n2007-08 went to \"pay scholarships to former athletes on dis-\ncontinued teams.\" Reply Br. 38. However, that need would\nhave been eliminated as those students graduated, no doubt\nreducing the scholarship gap created after the cuts were ini-\ntially made.\n\n   Finally, while the 11.94% disparity in scholarship alloca-\ntion cited by EIA appears more substantial than the participa-\ntion gap, the figure is based on the number of athletic slots at\nJMU, and not the number of individual athletes. For the 2007-\n08 academic year, for example, whereas each male athlete\nparticipated on only one team, a number of women athletes\nparticipated on more than one team such that there were actu-\nally only 240 individual female athletes compared to 196\nmale athletes. J.A. 311-313. Based on the 240 actual female\nathletes—as opposed to female athletic slots—at JMU,\nwomen only received 4.10% fewer scholarship dollars than\nmen.16 When calculated using individual athletes, the scholar-\nship gap is substantially smaller than that claimed by EIA.\n\n                                  VII.\n\n   The district court’s dismissal of EIA’s constitutional, statu-\ntory, and procedural claims against DOE and JMU was\nentirely proper. Accordingly, the judgment of the district\ncourt is\n\n                                                          AFFIRMED.\n  16\n     According to statistics collected by DOE for 2007-08, female athletic\nteams received 50.94% of athletics-related student aid at JMU. J.A. 313.\nBased on the actual number of female athletes (240) and not female ath-\nletic slots (320), female athletes represented 55.04% of the total student\nathletes at JMU in 2007-08. J.A. 311. 55.04% – 50.94% = 4.10%.\n\f</pre>",
