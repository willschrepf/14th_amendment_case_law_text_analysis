Rhoades appeals the order of the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Delaware dismissing his complaint filed against prison officials because it\n\ffailed to state a claim and was frivolous. In August 2005, Rhoades filed a lawsuit under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 against C.O. Carlton Adams, Adams’ supervisor, Cpl. W. Campbell,\n\nand the shift commander at Delaware Correction Center, Joseph Belanger, alleging that\n\nAdams filed a false disciplinary report against Rhoades and that officials in the chain of\n\ncommand permitted this action and failed to correct or discipline Adams for the false\n\nreport. He also sued Disciplinary Hearing Officer Lt. Larry Savage for denying him the\n\nright to confront his accuser or call witnesses at the hearing, and for not allowing him to\n\nsign the report box requesting appeal of the adverse decision. The district court dismissed\n\nthe complaint without prejudice on January 13, 2006. Rhoades timely appealed.\n\n       Because Rhoades is proceeding in forma pauperis, we must we must analyze his\n\nappeal for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B). Under\n\n§ 1915(e)(2)(B), we must dismiss an appeal if the underlying action (I) is frivolous or\n\nmalicious, (ii) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (iii) seeks\n\nmonetary damages from a defendant with immunity. An appeal can be frivolous for\n\neither legal or factual reasons. Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. 319, 325 (1989).\n\n       To state a claim for relief under § 1983, a complaint must sufficiently allege a\n\ndeprivation of a right secured by the constitution. See Nami v. Fauver, 82 F.3d 63, 65 (3d\n\nCir. 1996). Accepting as true all of the factual allegations in the complaint, as well as all\n\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn from them, see id., we agree with the district\n\ncourt’s conclusion that Rhoades’ allegations should be dismissed under § 1915(e)(2)(B).\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fRhoades alleges that his due process rights were violated when Adams filed a false report\n\nalleging that Rhoades slammed Adams’ hand in a cell door. He also maintains that\n\nAdams’ supervisors, Campbell and Belanger, permitted the promulgation of the false\n\ndisciplinary report.1 Rhoades asserts that the hearing officer sentenced him to 15 days in\n\nsegregation and that his security level classification was upgraded because of the adverse\n\nresult of the disciplinary hearing. However, these actions do not comprise a due process\n\nviolation because they do not rise to the level of an “atypical and significant hardship on\n\nthe inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life,” as required under the U.S.\n\nSupreme Court’s analysis in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). See Smith v.\n\nMesinger, 293 F.3d 641, 653 (3d Cir. 2002) (district court correctly dismissed due process\n\nclaim where allegation of false disciplinary report resulting in seven months’ disciplinary\n\nconfinement was not sufficient to constitute a due process deprivation under Sandin).\n\n       Rhoades also contends that the hearing officer, Savage, violated his rights to\n\nprocedural due process by interfering with Rhoades’ right to call and confront witnesses\n\nat the hearing and by not allowing him to sign the box on the disciplinary decision form\n\nconcerning his desire to appeal. However, this due process claim is problematic for the\n\n\n\n\n  1\n    Rhoades’ allegation that the defendants covered up for each other does not appear to\nbe a separate allegation for conspiracy, but is intertwined with his claim that he was\ndenied due process. To the extent that the district court dismissed it as a separate claim,\nwe agree that Rhoades did not convincingly allege the violation of his constitutional\nrights. See Kalmanovitz v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc., 595 F.Supp. 1385, 1400\n(D.Del. 1984), aff’d, 769 F.2d 152 (3d Cir. 1985).\n\n                                              3\n\fsame reasons discussed above, because Rhoades has not suffered an atypical and\n\nsignificant hardship, as required under Sandin. In any event, the inmate grievance\n\nprocedures, in themselves, do not confer a liberty interest protected by the due process\n\nclause in the inmate grievance procedures. See McGuire v. Forr, 1996 WL 131130 (E.D.\n\nPa. Mar. 21, 1996), aff’d 101 F.3d 691 (3d Cir. 1996); see also Antonelli v. Sheahan, 81\n\nF.3d 1422, 1430 (7th Cir. 1996) (state’s inmate grievance procedures do not give rise to\n\nliberty interest protected by the due process clause).\n\n       We will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B)(I). Rhoades’\n\nmotions for appointment of counsel and for discovery and production of documents will\n\nbe denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f",
