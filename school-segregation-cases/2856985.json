Glick Management Corporation for about 15 years. During\nthis time she received section 8 benefits from the Department of Housing and\nUrban Development (“HUD”). Echemendia sued Glick, its employees, and other\nrelated defendants under various civil rights laws claiming that the defendants\nconspired to segregate the housing of Hispanics and the disabled. While her\n\n\n      *\n       After an examination of the briefs and the record, we have concluded that\noral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the\nrecord. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n\fNo. 06-1799                                                                    Page 2\n\nlawsuit was pending, Echemendia requested two preliminary injunctions—one to\nprevent the termination of her section 8 subsidy and another to reinstate her\nsection 8 subsidy after it terminated—both of which the district court denied. She\nnow appeals the denial of her second preliminary injunction motion. Because\nEchemendia failed to demonstrate any likelihood of success on the merits, the\ndistrict court acted within its discretion in denying her second request for a\npreliminary injunction and we affirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n       In February 2005 Echemendia brought her claims against the defendants\n(collectively, “Glick”) under the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631,\nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the federal constitution, and\nIndiana fair housing and contract law. While her lawsuit was pending, Echemendia\nreceived notice from Glick reminding her of her annual obligation, pursuant to HUD\nregulations, to complete recertification papers if she wanted to maintain her section\n8 subsidy. See HUD Handbook No. 4350.3 REV-1 Chapter 7 § 1 at 7-9 (May 2003).\nSection 8 recipients must recertify annually on the anniversary date of their\nsubsidy; failure to recertify by the anniversary date can result in the loss of\nassistance. See id. at 7-16. HUD regulations require property owners to notify a\nsection 8 tenant of the annual recertification requirement multiple times: first, at\nthe time of certification, and then 120, 90, and 60 days before the tenant’s\nrecertification date. See id. at 7-9.\n\n       These notices must name a staff person at the property that the tenant must\ncontact to set up a recertification interview, and state that if the tenant fails to\nrespond before the anniversary date, she will be responsible for the market rent.\nSee id at 7-10 – 7-12. Echemendia’s annual recertification date was December 1,\n2005, and Glick sent her timely notices with the required contact information.\n\n       Instead of participating in a recertification interview with Glick, Echemendia\nfiled her first motion for a preliminary injunction on October 11, 2005, to prevent\nthe termination of her section 8 subsidy. Echemendia acknowledged that she\nreceived the three recertification notices from Glick—she attached them to her\npreliminary injunction motion—but said that she was unwilling to participate in\nthe recertification process because, in her view, Glick was not following other HUD\nprocedures in retaliation for her filing this suit. Among other things, Echemendia\nsaid that Glick failed to provide her with copies of forms that she would have to sign\nat the recertification interview and did not give her a copy of the initial reminder\nnotice that she signed at her 2004 recertification. The district court denied her\npreliminary injunction motion, which she does not appeal.\n\fNo. 06-1799                                                                     Page 3\n\n       After her section 8 benefits were terminated on December 1, 2005,\nEchemendia filed a second preliminary injunction motion, this time asking the\ncourt to command Glick to engage in the recertification process and deem her\nrecertified as of December 1, 2005. As is relevant to this appeal, Echemendia\nargued that Glick unlawfully retaliated against her by refusing to discuss\nrecertification with her on December 13 and 14, 2005, as she had requested.\n\n       Magistrate Judge Cosbey—presiding with the parties’ consent—denied\nEchemendia’s second motion for a preliminary injunction. The judge found that,\nshortly after Echemendia failed to recertify by December 1, 2005, Glick assigned\nher section 8 housing (of which there are a limited number) to another tenant who\nqualified for section 8 benefits and had been on a waiting list. He further found\nthat Glick refused to recertify her in mid-December because of the unavailability of\nsection 8 housing at that time. Judge Cosbey concluded, therefore, that\nEchemendia could not show that she would likely succeed on the merits of her 42\nU.S.C. § 3617 FHA retaliation claim because Glick’s reasons for not recertifying her\nwere not unlawful.\n\n                                       Analysis\n\n      Echemendia appeals the denial of her second motion for a preliminary\ninjunction. She makes three arguments that the district court abused its discretion\nin denying the injunction. She contends that Glick’s retaliatory refusal to recertify\nher on December 13 and 14: (1) violated § 3617 of the FHA, (2) breached her lease,\nand (3) did not comply with HUD recertification procedures in violation of due\nprocess.\n\n       In reviewing a district court’s denial of a preliminary injunction, we review\nlegal conclusions de novo and findings of fact and the application of law to fact for\nclear error. See Joelner v. Vill. of Wash. Park, 378 F.3d 613, 619-20 (7th Cir. 2004);\nUnited States v. Buford, 201 F.3d 937, 941 (7th Cir. 2000); Williams v. Comm’r of\nInternal Revenue, 1 F.3d 502, 505 (7th Cir. 1993). “A district court’s decision to\ngrant or deny an injunction is entitled to deference by the reviewing courts, and we\nshall reverse only for an abuse of discretion.” Dupuy v. Samuels, 397 F.3d 493, 502\n(7th Cir. 2005). Finally, a party seeking a preliminary injunction must\ndemonstrate, among other things, that it has a reasonable likelihood of success on\nthe merits of the underlying claim. See AM Gen. Corp. v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.,\n311 F.3d 796, 803-04 (7th Cir. 2002). If the party seeking the injunction cannot\nestablish any likelihood, the court ends its inquiry and denies the request. See id.;\nKiel v. City of Kenosha, 236 F.3d 814, 815-16 (7th Cir. 2000).\n\n      The FHA provides statutory authority for preliminary injunctive relief. 42\nU.S.C. § 3613(c). To prevail on a claim of retaliation under § 3617 of the FHA,\n\fNo. 06-1799                                                                     Page 4\n\nEchemendia must show both a retaliatory motive and Glick’s intent to discriminate\non a forbidden ground (i.e., race or disability) when it refused to recertify her. See\nEast-Miller v. Lake County Highway Dep’t, 421 F.3d 558, 563 (7th Cir. 2005)\n(holding “that a showing of intentional discrimination is an essential element of a\n§ 3617 claim” of retaliation); Sofarelli v. Pinellas County, 931 F.2d 718, 722 (11th\nCir. 1991) (requiring plaintiffs to show “that race played some role” in the\ndefendants’ actions that allegedly violated § 3617). Evidence of Glick’s\ndiscriminatory intent may be direct or indirect through the burden-shifting\nframework established in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973).\nSee East-Miller, 421 F.3d at 563; Kormoczy v. Sec’y, United States Dep’t of Hous. &\nUrban Dev., 53 F.3d 821, 823 (7th Cir. 1995) (the elements of a claim alleging\nhousing discrimination follow closely the elements of a claim for employment\ndiscrimination).\n\n       Echemendia has no direct evidence that Glick refused to recertify her on\nDecember 13 and 14 because of her disability or race. She appears to argue that a\nposter displayed by Glick stating that it accepted “mobility impaired” tenants\nsuggested a preference for such individuals and was therefore direct evidence that\nGlick disliked disabled persons who were not mobility impaired. But a poster\nstating that Glick accepts mobility-impaired individuals is not an admission that\nGlick prefers them to non-mobility impaired disabled individuals. See Kormoczy, 53\nF.3d at 824 (“Direct evidence is that which can be interpreted as an\nacknowledgment of the defendant’s discriminatory intent”).\n\n       Echemendia’s next argument appears to be that she has met her prima facie\ncase of proving discrimination indirectly. She regards the fourth prong of the prima\nfacie case as requiring that the section 8 “slot” remained open after she asked Glick\nto engage in recertification on December 13 and 14. But Judge Cosbey concluded\nthat after Echemendia failed to recertify on December 1, Glick awarded her section\n8 subsidy to another tenant and the slot was filled by December 13. Judge Cosbey’s\nfactual determination was not clearly erroneous. See Joelner, 378 at 619-20.\nMoreover, if we treat the fourth prong of her prima facie case as requiring that she\nshow that the slot was filled with a similarly situated individual outside of her\nprotected class, see Ballance v. City of Springfield, 424 F.3d 614, 617 (7th Cir.\n2005), her case still fails. Echemendia has not adduced any evidence to show that a\nnon-disabled or non-Hispanic individual who missed the recertification deadline\nwas treated better. Because her prima facie case necessarily fails at the fourth\nprong, there was no abuse of discretion in denying the preliminary injunction on the\ntheory that Glick violated the FHA in refusing to recertify her in mid-December.\n\n       For related reasons, Echemendia also cannot show any likelihood of success\non her breach of contract claim. Echemendia argues that Glick breached her lease\nby refusing to recertify her on December 13 and 14 because her lease provided that\n\fNo. 06-1799                                                                      Page 5\n\nshe could recertify after the recertification deadline if “assistance was available.”\nBut because Judge Cosbey’s finding that assistance (that is, subsidized housing)\nwas not available on those dates was not clear error, there was no likelihood of\nsuccess in proving breach and no abuse of discretion in denying the preliminary\ninjunction on this ground.\n\n       Finally, Echemendia cannot show any likelihood that she would succeed on\nthe merits of her claim that Glick’s actions violated due process. She seems to\ncontend that she has a property interest in her section 8 welfare benefit, citing\nGoldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970), and therefore Glick violated her due process\nrights by not following HUD recertification procedures. But “[p]rocedural due\nprocess imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of\nliberty or property interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the\nFifth or Fourteenth Amendment.” Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976)\n(emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted); see Banks v. Sec’y of Ind. Family &\nSoc. Servs. Admin., 997 F.2d 231, 246-47 (7th Cir. 1993). Echemendia does not\nallege that the actions of Glick were the actions of either the federal or state\ngovernment, and private action is beyond the reach of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S.\n189, 195-96 (1989); Banks, 997 F.2d at 247. (Echemendia did sue HUD but HUD\nwas dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds and Echemedia does not challenge\nthat dismissal on appeal). Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in denying\nthe preliminary injunction on this ground.\n\n       We conclude by noting that the magistrate judge also did not abuse his\ndiscretion in denying Echemendia’s Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider his denial of her\nrequested preliminary injunction. She merely rehashed previously rejected\narguments and did not show why her new evidence could not have been presented\nto the district court earlier. See Neal v. Newspaper Holdings, Inc., 349 F.3d 363,\n368 (7th Cir. 2003); Bordelon v. Chicago Sch. Reform Bd. of Trs., 233 F.3d 524, 529\n(7th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                                                           AFFIRMED.\n\f",

Sec’y, United States Dep’t of Hous. &\nUrban Dev., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695194\"><a href=\"/opinion/695194/piroshka-kormoczy-ida-keszeg-arpad-keszeg-michael-godollei-irene/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 823 (7th Cir. 1995) (the elements of a claim alleging\nhousing discrimination follow closely the elements of a claim for employment\ndiscrimination).\n\n       Echemendia has no direct evidence that Glick refused to recertify her on\nDecember 13 and 14 because of her disability or race. She appears to argue that a\nposter displayed by Glick stating that it accepted “mobility impaired” tenants\nsuggested a preference for such individuals and was therefore direct evidence that\nGlick disliked disabled persons who were not mobility impaired. But a poster\nstating that Glick accepts mobility-impaired individuals is not an admission that\nGlick prefers them to non-mobility impaired disabled individuals. See Kormoczy, 53\nF.3d at 824 (“Direct evidence is that which can be interpreted as an\nacknowledgment of the defendant’s discriminatory intent”).\n\n       Echemendia’s next argument appears to be that she has met her prima facie\ncase of proving discrimination indirectly. She regards the fourth prong of the prima\nfacie case as requiring that the section 8 “slot” remained open after she asked Glick\nto engage in recertification on December 13 and 14. But Judge Cosbey concluded\nthat after Echemendia failed to recertify on December 1, Glick awarded her section\n8 subsidy to another tenant and the slot was filled by December 13. Judge Cosbey’s\nfactual determination was not clearly erroneous. See Joelner, 378 at 619-20.\nMoreover, if we treat the fourth prong of her prima facie case as requiring that she\nshow that the slot was filled with a similarly situated individual outside of her\nprotected class, see Ballance v. City of Springfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792015\"><a href=\"/opinion/792015/david-ballance-v-city-of-springfield-illinois-police-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">614</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 617 (7th Cir.\n2005), her case still fails. Echemendia has not adduced any evidence to show that a\nnon-disabled or non-Hispanic individual who missed the recertification deadline\nwas treated better. Because her prima facie case necessarily fails at the fourth\nprong, there was no abuse of discretion in denying the preliminary injunction on the\ntheory that Glick violated the FHA in refusing to recertify her in mid-December.\n\n       For related reasons, Echemendia also cannot show any likelihood of success\non her breach of contract claim. Echemendia argues that Glick breached her lease\nby refusing to recertify her on December 13 and 14 because her lease provided that\n\fNo. 06-1799                                                                      Page 5\n\nshe could recertify after the recertification deadline if “assistance was available.”\nBut because Judge Cosbey’s finding that assistance (that is, subsidized housing)\nwas not available on those dates was not clear error, there was no likelihood of\nsuccess in proving breach and no abuse of discretion in denying the preliminary\ninjunction on this ground.\n\n       Finally, Echemendia cannot show any likelihood that she would succeed on\nthe merits of her claim that Glick’s actions violated due process. She seems to\ncontend that she has a property interest in her section 8 welfare benefit, citing\nGoldberg v. Kelly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108100\"><a href=\"/opinion/108100/goldberg-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1970), and therefore Glick violated her due process\nrights by not following HUD recertification procedures. But “[p]rocedural due\nprocess imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of\nliberty or property interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the\nFifth or Fourteenth Amendment.” Mathews v. Eldridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 332 (1976)\n(emphasis added) (internal quotations omitted); see Banks v. Sec’y of Ind. Family &\nSoc. Servs. Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610616\"><a href=\"/opinion/610616/marie-banks-individually-and-as-a-representative-of-a-class-of-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 246-47 (7th Cir. 1993). Echemendia does not\nallege that the actions of Glick were the actions of either the federal or state\ngovernment, and private action is beyond the reach of the Fifth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep’t of Soc. Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195-96 (1989); Banks, 997 F.2d at 247. (Echemendia did sue HUD but HUD\nwas dismissed on sovereign immunity grounds and Echemedia does not challenge\nthat dismissal on appeal). Accordingly, there was no abuse of discretion in denying\nthe preliminary injunction on this ground.\n\n       We conclude by noting that the magistrate judge also did not abuse his\ndiscretion in denying Echemendia’s Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider his denial of her\nrequested preliminary injunction. She merely rehashed previously rejected\narguments and did not show why her new evidence could not have been presented\nto the district court earlier. See Neal v.
