He submitted a request under\nthe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, to the\nExecutive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA), a part\nof the United States Department of Justice. See Harris v.\nGonzales, 488 F.3d 442, 443 (D.C. Cir. 2007). FOIA requires\nfederal agencies to produce “records” upon request unless one\nof nine statutory exemptions applies.                5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(a)(3)(A). Murphy sought grand jury information for\ntwo criminal cases. The EOUSA gave Murphy most of the\ninformation that he requested but it declined to disclose the\ndates and times of day that the grand jury met to hear testimony\nand consider evidence in the two cases. The EOUSA invoked\nexemption 3 to justify its non-disclosure.               Murphy\ncontends—unsurprisingly—that exemption 3 is inapplicable\nand filed suit to compel the EOUSA to disclose the withheld\nmaterial. The district court ultimately held that exemption 3\nwas properly invoked and granted summary judgment to the\nEOUSA. We affirm.\n\n                               I\n\n     FOIA implements “a general philosophy of full agency\ndisclosure.” DOJ v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the\nPress, 489 U.S. 749, 754 (1989). The statute requires federal\nagencies to make “records promptly available” when an\nindividual submits a “request for records which (i) reasonably\ndescribes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with\npublished rules.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A). An agency,\nhowever, can reject the request if it “fall[s] within one of nine\n\f                               3\nexemptions.” Milner v. Dep’t of Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259, 1262\n(2011); see 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1)–(9). The United States\nSupreme Court has stated that the exemptions must be\n“narrowly construed” because “the mandate of the FOIA calls\nfor broad disclosure of Government records.” DOJ v. Julian,\n486 U.S. 1, 8 (1988) (alteration omitted). The Court has also\ncautioned, however, that each exemption must be given\n“meaningful reach and application.” John Doe Agency v.\nJohn Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146, 152 (1989).\n\n     The exemption relevant here is exemption 3, which\npermits an agency to withhold records that are “specifically\nexempted from disclosure by statute.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3).\nWe have recognized that “requests for documents related to\ngrand jury investigations implicate FOIA’s third exemption.”\nLopez v. DOJ, 393 F.3d 1345, 1349 (D.C. Cir. 2005). Rule\n6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure prohibits\ncertain persons designated therein (including government\nattorneys) from “disclos[ing] a matter occurring before the\ngrand jury,” FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e)(2)(B), and, although a rule is\nnot generally considered to be a statute, it qualifies as one\nunder FOIA because the Congress has enacted it into positive\nlaw. See Fund for Constitutional Gov’t v. Nat’l Archives and\nRecords Serv., 656 F.2d 856, 867–68 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (citing\nPub. L. No. 95-78, § 2(a), 91 Stat. 319 (1977)). Hence,\ninformation related to a grand jury matter may be withheld\nunder exemption 3 “if the disclosed material would tend to\nreveal some secret aspect of the grand jury’s investigation,\nincluding the identities of witnesses.” Hodge v. FBI, 703 F.3d\n575, 580 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n    In 2008, Murphy was charged with distribution,\npossession and conspiracy to distribute and possess heroin and\ncrack cocaine. See United States v. Murphy, 460 F. App’x\n122, 123 (3d Cir. 2012). He was convicted of both counts\n\f                                4\nafter a two-day jury trial and sentenced to 360 months’\nimprisonment. Id. In 2013, Murphy submitted two FOIA\nrequests to the EOUSA for “information and documents.”\nJoint Appendix (JA) 25, 31. His first FOIA request asked for:\n\n       disclosure of the dates that the grand jury\n       convened in reference to case # 1:08-CR-00433\n       and case # 1:08-CR-314 filed in U.S. District\n       Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\n       including the names [sic] of the Judge who\n       summoned the grand jury, the date the\n       indictments were returned, the date they were\n       discharged, the starting and ending date of the\n       grand jury’s term, and a certified copy of the\n       courts [sic] minute entries.\n\nId. at 39. Case number 08-CR-00433 is Murphy’s criminal\ncase and case number 08-CR-00314 is a criminal case\ninvolving Richard Byrd.\n\n    Approximately two months later, Murphy submitted a\nsecond FOIA request that sought:\n\n       disclosure of the dates the grand jury issued the\n       indictments pertaining to criminal No.\n       1:08-CR-314 and 1:08-CR-0433 . . . including\n       the dates and times of sessions the grand jury\n       convened, whether it was summoned pursuant\n       to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(a), or 18 U.S.C. 1331, and\n       the certified letter requesting the special grand\n       jury . . . the caption of the indictment . . . [and]\n       an unredacted copy of the indictment of Case\n       No. 1:08-CR-314 pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P.\n       49.1(b)(9).\n\f                                 5\nId. at 42. Before the EOUSA responded to his requests,\nMurphy filed suit in federal district court. 1 He challenged the\nEOUSA’s invocation of exemption 3 and alleged that the grand\njury indictments were inaccurate and that the EOUSA’s search\nfor records was inadequate. He asked the court to order the\nEOUSA to produce the “agency records previously requested\nby [him].” Am. Compl. ¶ 1.\n\n     After Murphy filed his complaint, the EOUSA responded\nto both of his FOIA requests. It first told Murphy that it\nintended to disclose “all records required to be released, or\nconsidered appropriate for release as a matter of discretion.”\nJA 45. These included “the date the grand jury was impaneled\nand expired; the name of the judge who supervised the grand\njury; [and] the date on which the grand jury was convened and\nreturned an indictment for each particular criminal case.” Id.\nat 37. It also disclosed that both of the “grand juries . . . were\nsummoned pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(a).” Id. at 47.\nOther than its disclosure of the date on which the grand jury\nissued indictments, the EOUSA declined to provide the\nspecific dates and “times the grand juries convened” between\nthe date of empanelment and the date each grand jury was\ndischarged “in order to protect the identity of witnesses and the\n\n1\n   Murphy properly filed suit before the EOUSA responded to his\nrequests because he had constructively exhausted his administrative\nremedies. “As a general matter, a FOIA requester must exhaust\nadministrative appeal remedies before seeking judicial redress.”\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash. v. FEC, 711 F.3d\n180, 182 (D.C. Cir. 2013). But a requester “shall be deemed to have\nexhausted his administrative remedies with respect to [his] request”\nif the agency does not respond to the FOIA request within 20\nbusiness days. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i), (C)(i). The EOUSA\ndid not timely respond to Murphy’s FOIA requests and Murphy then\nbegan this litigation.\n\f                                6\nsecrecy of the grand jury proceedings.” Id. It invoked\nexemptions 3 and 7(C) to support its decision. 2 Id.\n\n     Less than one month after responding to Murphy’s second\nFOIA request, the EOUSA moved for summary judgment.\nThe district court granted the motion in part. See Murphy v.\nEOUSA, 11 F. Supp. 3d 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2013). It held that\nMurphy’s claims regarding the accuracy of the records and the\nadequacy of the government’s search were premised on a\n“misunderstanding.” Id. at 5. According to the court,\nMurphy’s claim that some of the records were inaccurate and\nthat others did not disclose what he “expected to find” did not\namount to a FOIA violation. Id. It then found the EOUSA’s\ndeclaration, executed by EOUSA attorney advisor Kathleen\nBrandon, insufficient because it contained only one “obscure\nstatement” related to exemption 3. Id. at 6. The court\ntherefore ordered the EOUSA to disclose each date and the\ntimes of day on each date that the grand jury convened to\nconsider Murphy’s and Byrd’s cases. 3 Id. at 7.\n\n\n2\n   Exemption 7(C) permits an agency to withhold records “compiled\nfor law enforcement purposes” if disclosure of such records “could\nreasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of\npersonal privacy.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7). Because we hold that the\nEOUSA properly invoked exemption 3, we do not address whether it\nalso properly invoked exemption 7(C). See Larson v. Dep’t of\nState, 565 F.3d 857, 862–63 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“agencies may invoke\nthe exemptions independently and courts may uphold agency action\nunder one exemption without considering the applicability” of\nothers).\n3\n   So that the record is clear, we describe exactly the information\nthat was disclosed to Murphy. Murphy requested and received the\ndate the grand jury was empaneled, the date the grand jury returned\nindictments and the date the grand jury was discharged. In his\n\f                                  7\n\nsecond FOIA request, Murphy explicitly requested “the dates and\ntimes of sessions the grand jury convened” whenever the grand jury\nmet to consider his case and Byrd’s case during the approximately\nsix-month period between empanelment and discharge. JA 42; see\nalso supra pp. 4–6 (describing Murphy’s FOIA requests and\nEOUSA’s response thereto). The EOUSA did not disclose that\ninformation to Murphy but did disclose it to the district court in\ncamera. See Murphy v. EOUSA, 11 F. Supp. 3d 7, 9 (D.D.C. 2014)\n(district court reviewed in camera “the documents which contain . . .\nthe requested times that the grand jury convened”). The EOUSA\nalso disclosed the same material to this Court in camera. The\nEOUSA counsel confirmed in a post-argument letter to this Court\nthat the dates and times of day the grand jury met to consider\nMurphy’s and Byrd’s cases have not been disclosed to Murphy.\nTherefore, the only information in dispute—and the only\ninformation Murphy has not yet received—covers the dates and\ntimes of day the grand jury met to consider Murphy’s and Byrd’s\ncases as distinct from the dates the grand jury issued its indictments\nin the two cases.\n     What confusion may have existed is likely due to Murphy’s use\nof “convene.” “Convene” usually refers to the empanelment of the\ngrand jury. See Convene, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed.\n2014) (“To call together, esp. for a formal meeting; to cause to\nassemble.”); see also, e.g., In re Sealed Case, 199 F.3d 522, 523\n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (independent counsel “convened a grand jury to\nconsider evidence”). The EOUSA disclosed that information to\nMurphy. JA 45 (releasing the date the grand jury was empaneled to\nMurphy). But he also asked for the “dates and times of sessions the\ngrand jury convened” to consider both his case and Byrd’s case. Id.\nat 42 (emphasis added). We take him to mean the dates and times\nthe grand jury met to consider evidence or to deliberate in his and\nByrd’s cases separate from the dates the grand jury indictments\nissued. Amicus agrees with our interpretation of Murphy’s FOIA\nrequest. See Amicus Br. 16 (Murphy has “the dates the grand juries\nbegan their sessions” but not the dates and times of day “the grand\njuries were in session” after empanelment).\n\f                               8\n     Both parties moved for reconsideration. See Murphy, 11\nF. Supp. 3d at 8. The EOUSA also filed a supplemental\ndeclaration, again executed by Brandon, in support of its\nmotion. The district court noted that Murphy’s motion for\nreconsideration contained the same arguments he had\npreviously made regarding the adequacy of the search and the\naccuracy of the records. See id. at 8–9. Because he did not\nidentify “an intervening change in the law,” “new evidence not\npreviously available” or “a clear error in the first order,” the\ndistrict court denied his motion. Id.\n\n     The district court, however, granted the EOUSA’s motion\nfor reconsideration after reviewing the withheld material in\ncamera and concluding that it “contain[ed] information that\nwould reveal secret aspects of a grand jury investigation.” Id.\nat 9. Additionally, the court held that the withheld material\nwas “inextricably intertwined” with non-exempt information,\nmaking it infeasible to segregate and produce any unprotected\ninformation. Id. Accordingly, it granted summary judgment\nto the EOUSA. Id. Murphy timely appealed. We appointed\namicus curiae to present arguments in support of Murphy’s\nposition.\n\n                              II\n\n     We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment. McKinley v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve\nSys., 647 F.3d 331, 335 (D.C. Cir. 2011). Our task on appeal\nis to “ascertain whether the agency has sustained its burden of\ndemonstrating that the documents requested are exempt from\ndisclosure under the FOIA.” Newport Aeronautical Sales v.\nDep’t of Air Force, 684 F.3d 160, 164 (D.C. Cir. 2012)\n(alteration omitted). An agency can meet this burden by\nsubmitting “affidavits [that] describe the justifications for\nnondisclosure with reasonably specific detail” and\n\f                                   9\n“demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls\nwithin the claimed exemption.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 862.\nWe have emphasized that an agency’s task is not herculean.\nThe justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if\nit “appears logical or plausible.” Id. (quotation marks\nomitted). We believe the EOUSA’s basis for invoking\nexemption 3 is both logical and plausible.\n\n     The EOUSA’s supplemental Brandon Declaration\nexplains why releasing the dates and times of day the grand\njury convened to consider Murphy’s and Byrd’s cases could\nreveal grand jury witness identities. Assume that a suspect\nknows his girlfriend witnessed the crime he is suspected of\ncommitting. Also assume (plausibly) that he can discover\nfrom friends or family members whether his girlfriend was\nabsent from work or school on a particular day and time.\nOnce convicted, the suspect wants to know whether his\ngirlfriend in fact provided testimony to the grand jury. If the\ngovernment discloses the dates and times of day that the grand\njury convened, he can compare those dates and times with his\ngirlfriend’s corresponding absences. If the grand jury met on\na day and time that his girlfriend missed school or work, he\ncould infer that she could have testified before the grand jury.\nSee JA 56–57 (providing similar example). 4\n\n\n4\n   This is not the only scenario that could involve a risk of disclosing\nthe identity of a grand jury witness. The same risk could occur if\nthe criminal defendant and the suspected grand jury witness are\ncellmates. Knowing when the grand jury met could provide an easy\nway for him to determine whether his cellmate was likely providing\ntestimony. If the grand jury met on a day and at a time that the\ncellmate was absent, the inference is plain: His cellmate could have\ntestified. Moreover, cellmates’ close proximity to one another\nenhances the opportunity for (and success of) retaliation, which\n\f                               10\n      The EOUSA’s position is all the more reasonable because\nit is based on extensive experience. The EOUSA declarant\nwas an assistant United States Attorney with more than twenty\nyears’ experience handling criminal cases in federal court. Id.\nat 56. She averred that she “went to great lengths” to keep\ngrand jury proceedings secret in order to “protect the identity\nof the witnesses.” Id. Secrecy is essential because, in her\nexperience, “defendants often went to great lengths to discover\nthe identity of witnesses in their cases, both before and after\ntrial.” Id. at 57. We cannot lightly brush aside both the logic\nand experience underlying the EOUSA’s decision to withhold\nthe requested information. Cf. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nDep’t of the Air Force, 375 F.3d 1182, 1190 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n(suggesting government can justify disclosure under FOIA\nwith “special knowledge based upon its experience”); Taylor v.\nDep’t of the Army, 684 F.2d 99, 109 (D.C. Cir. 1982)\n(government affidavits explaining why material was classified\nwere entitled to deference because of affiants’ “experience”).\n\n     Granted, simply because an individual misses work or is\notherwise unaccountably absent does not mean we can be\ncertain that he provided testimony to a grand jury. But\nexemption 3 is not limited to circumstances that are certain to\nreveal a witness’s identity. Instead, the exemption is properly\ninvoked if “the disclosed material would tend to reveal some\nsecret aspect of the grand jury’s investigation, including the\nidentities of witnesses.” Hodge, 703 F.3d at 580 (emphasis\nadded; quotation marks omitted). A tendency need only make\na result more likely. See Tendency, OXFORD ENGLISH\nDICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989) (“leaning,” “inclination” or “bent\ntoward some . . . result”). The EOUSA has demonstrated how\n\nraises an even more compelling security concern than with someone\nwho is not confined with the defendant. See JA 56–57.\n\f                               11\ndisclosing the specific dates and times of day a grand jury met\nto consider a particular “matter” makes it more likely that a\nwitness’s identity can be discovered. See supra pp. 9–10; see\nalso Lopez, 393 F.3d at 1350 (“[R]evealing the dates of\npreliminary interviews conducted for the purposes of\n‘screening’ potential [grand jury] witnesses may in fact tend to\nreveal some secret aspect of the grand jury.” (emphasis added;\nsome quotation marks omitted)).\n\n     The EOUSA’s position also draws from the plausibility of\nits explanation for invoking exemption 3. It reasonably\nbelieves that a criminal suspect or defendant not only wants to\ndiscover a grand jury witness’s identity but that he may also\nwant to retaliate against that witness. See JA 57 (if\n“defendants . . . discover the identity of witnesses,” “that\nperson’s safety was in jeopardy”). Federal prosecutors are not\nthe only ones who believe that grand jury witnesses confront a\nrisk of retaliation; the Congress falls squarely in that camp as\nwell. That is why federal law prohibits tampering with or\nretaliating against witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (witness\ntampering unlawful); id. § 1513 (retaliation against witnesses\nunlawful). These laws are not a solution in search of a\nproblem; there are countless cases dealing with successful\ncriminal prosecutions for both witness tampering and witness\nretaliation. See, e.g., United States v. Wardell, 591 F.3d 1279,\n1283 (10th Cir. 2009) (affirming conviction of “conspiring to\nretaliate against a witness” and “retaliating against a witness”);\nUnited States v. Wilson, 160 F.3d 732, 736 (D.C. Cir. 1998)\n(affirming convictions of “conspiracy to kill a witness, killing a\nwitness with intent to prevent him from testifying, [and]\nretaliating against a witness” (citations omitted)); United\nStates v. Cunningham, 54 F.3d 295, 297 (7th Cir. 1995)\n(affirming convictions of “retaliating against a federal\nwitness”). And grand jury witnesses in particular—despite\nthe government’s best efforts to keep their identities\n\f                                12\nsecret—have not been immune from similar threats. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Gallimore, 491 F.3d 871, 873 (8th Cir. 2007)\n(affirming defendant’s sentence after he “pled guilty to\nretaliating against a grand jury witness”); United States v.\nMaggitt, 784 F.2d 590, 594 (5th Cir. 1986) (affirming\nconviction of tampering with and retaliating against witness\nbecause jury could have found defendant’s “threat was\nintended in retaliation against [the witness] for his earlier\ntestimony before the grand jury”).\n\n     The reported cases highlight that the risk of witness\nretaliation is real or, at least, “plausible.” Larson, 565 F.3d at\n862. The risk of retaliation against grand jury witnesses is one\nreason for maintaining grand jury secrecy. See United States\nv. Proctor & Gamble Co., 356 U.S. 677, 681–82 (1958)\n(“long-established policy” of grand jury secrecy rests in part on\n“encourag[ing] all witnesses to step forward and testify freely\nwithout fear of retaliation”). The government plainly has a\nstrong interest in witness safety.\n\n     While the consequence of disclosing information that\ntends to reveal the identity of grand jury witnesses is, by itself,\nsubstantial, that risk alone is not the only reason for protecting\nthe times and dates a grand jury considered evidence or\ndeliberated in a particular case. Disclosing the days and times\na grand jury met to consider evidence and hear testimony\nwould also reveal the content of grand jury deliberations by\ndisclosing how long a particular “matter occurr[ed] before the\ngrand jury,” FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e), how much or how little\nevidence was weighed and which witnesses most occupied the\ngrand jury’s time. That information could shed light on the\nnature of the grand jury’s investigative and deliberative\nprocesses. Because disclosing the day-and-time information\nMurphy sought would tend to reveal the complexity and\n“scope, focus and direction of the grand jury investigations,”\n\f                                13\nthat information is protected from disclosure by Rule 6(e) even\nif no disclosure of witness identity or risk of retaliation exists.\nSee Fund for Constitutional Gov’t, 656 F.2d at 869.\n\n     Amicus offers several rejoinders. We find none of them\npersuasive. First, amicus argues that the supplemental\nBrandon Declaration is insufficient because it does not point to\nan actual case in which a witness’s identity was revealed after\ndisclosing the dates and times of day a grand jury met. But the\nbasis for invoking exemption 3 need only be “logical or\nplausible.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 862. A risk of harm is\nplausible even if the anticipated harm has not yet materialized.\nSee ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[A]\nreviewing court must take into account that any affidavit or\nother agency statement of threatened harm . . . will always be\nspeculative to some extent, in the sense that it describes a\npotential future harm.” (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)).\nLikewise, an explanation is no less plausible because it posits\npersuasive hypotheticals rather than real-world examples. Cf.\nMudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon v. ITC, 846 F.2d\n1527, 1532 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (suggesting agency could have\ncured insufficient FOIA affidavit by providing “hypothetical\nexamples”).\n\n    Second, amicus contends there is little risk that Murphy\ncould use the requested information to identify grand jury\nwitnesses because the grand juries convened five to seven\nyears ago. But there is no time limit on the secrecy of grand\njury proceedings. See Fund for Constitutional Gov’t, 656\nF.2d at 869 n.32 (“the chronological remoteness of grand jury\nproceedings bears no relevance to [a] FOIA inquiry” and “[t]he\ngeneral rule [of grand jury secrecy] admits to no exception for\nold grand jury proceedings”). Moreover, we have previously\ndecided FOIA cases seeking years-old grand jury information\nand not once intimated that the passage of time made Rule 6\n\f                              14\ninapplicable. See Hodge, 703 F.3d at 579 (2002 FOIA request\nseeking grand jury information related to 1985 conviction);\nLopez, 393 F.3d at 1347 (1997 FOIA requests seeking grand\njury information leading to 1990 indictment).\n\n     Amicus further claims that the information which we have\npreviously held to be covered by exemption 3 is different from\nthe date-and-time information that Murphy wants. Amicus\nstates that, notwithstanding that documents that include the\nname of a grand jury witness necessarily disclose his identity,\nthe same cannot be said for the dates and times of day a grand\njury meets. This argument misunderstands what is needed to\nsuccessfully invoke exemption 3. The test is whether “the\ndisclosed material would tend to reveal some secret aspect of\nthe grand jury’s investigation, including the identities of\nwitnesses.” Hodge, 703 F.3d at 580 (emphasis added).\n\n     Finally, amicus identifies three cases in which the Justice\nDepartment allegedly disclosed the dates and times of day a\ngrand jury convened to hear testimony. We find all three\ninapposite. In one, the Justice Department was ordered to\ndisclose “the date the grand jury convened, the date the\nindictment was returned or issued, and the date the grand jury\nwas discharged.” Hill v. DOJ, No. 11-cv-00273, ECF No. 29,\nat 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 19, 2011) (magistrate report and\nrecommendation). This information revealed nothing more\nthan when “the grand jury’s work began and ended.” Id.\nMurphy has this information for the two criminal cases\nidentified in his FOIA requests.\n\n     In the second case, the Justice Department declined to\ndisclose “the dates the grand jury convened.” Peay v. DOJ,\nNo. 04-cv-1859, 2007 WL 788871, at *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 14,\n2007). The district court denied the government’s summary\njudgment motion because its declaration did not explain “how\n\f                                  15\nthe disclosure of the dates the grand jury convened would tend\nto reveal a ‘secret aspect’ of the grand jury investigation.” Id.\nIn contrast, we have here the second Brandon Declaration.\n\n     Amicus also points to North v. DOJ, 774 F. Supp. 2d 217\n(D.D.C. 2011), a district court case in which the Justice\nDepartment released “cover sheets and final pages of\ntranscripts of grand jury testimony . . . that indicated the date\nthat the testimony was given.” Id. at 220. The Justice\nDepartment had initially withheld the information; it was\nreleased only after the district court found its FOIA\ndeclarations wanting.        Compare North v. DOJ, No.\n08-cv-01439, ECF No. 17-1, at 6, ¶ 19 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2008)\n(categorically denying “entire [FOIA] request” because “all of\nthe materials requested were specifically identified as grand\njury materials”), with id. ECF No. 71-1, at 5, ¶ 14 (D.D.C. Apr.\n15, 2010) (releasing documents that “allow plaintiff to see\nwhen the proceedings took place since the redactions do not\ninclude the dates”). The Justice Department’s initial response\nin North is consistent with the EOUSA’s position here,\nnamely, that the dates and times of day the grand jury meets to\nconsider a specific case are protected by exemption 3. In any\nevent, North does not bind this court. 5\n\n\n5\n  Amicus also contends that the district court’s segregability analysis\nwas insufficient. We disagree. An agency can withhold records\nthat are exempt from disclosure under FOIA but it must produce\n“[a]ny reasonably segregable” portion thereof that does not fit one of\nthe statutory exemptions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). Here, however, there\nis no segregability problem.           Murphy requested specific\n“information”—i.e., the dates and times of day the grand jury met to\nconsider his case and Byrd’s case. JA 25, 31. Once the EOUSA\ndeclined to disclose the requested information, there was nothing left\nto segregate. Cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. DOJ, 432 F.3d 366, 370\n\f                                 16\n    Finally, we address one remaining minor issue. In his\ninformal brief to this Court, Murphy requested an unredacted\ncopy of the indictment in Byrd’s case. Murphy admitted in\ndistrict court that the only redacted information in the Byrd\nindictment was the grand jury foreperson’s name and\nsignature. This information is plainly protected under\nexemption 3. See Hodge, 703 F.3d at 580 (exemption 3\nprotects information that would “tend to reveal some secret\naspect of the grand jury’s investigation, including the identities\nof . . . jurors” (quotation marks omitted)). Although the\nEOUSA has not invoked exemption 3 to protect the identity of\nthe grand jury foreperson, we can uphold ex mero motu\nnon-disclosure of information when ordering disclosure would\n“endanger the safety and privacy of third parties.” August v.\nFBI, 328 F.3d 697, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see also id. (“The law\ndoes not require that third parties pay for the Government’s\nmistakes.”).\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s judgment is\naffirmed.\n\n                                                        So ordered.\n\n\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2005) (segregability does not apply if “there simply are no\n‘reasonably segregable’ portions to release after deletion of the\nportions which are exempt.” (ellipsis and some quotation marks\nomitted)).\n     In addition, Murphy’s inadequate-search challenge fails\nbecause the adequacy of the search becomes a moot point if the\nrequested information is in fact found but not disclosed. See\nBlanton v. DOJ, 64 F. App’x 787, 788–89 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (per\ncuriam) (plaintiff’s challenge to adequacy of search was “moot”\nwhen agency “found th[e] [requested] documents”).\n\f",

Murphy sought grand jury information for\ntwo criminal cases. The EOUSA gave Murphy most of the\ninformation that he requested but it declined to disclose the\ndates and times of day that the grand jury met to hear testimony\nand consider evidence in the two cases. The EOUSA invoked\nexemption 3 to justify its non-disclosure.               Murphy\ncontends—unsurprisingly—that exemption 3 is inapplicable\nand filed suit to compel the EOUSA to disclose the withheld\nmaterial.

Murphy, 460 F. App’x\n122, 123 (3d Cir. 2012). He was convicted of both counts\n\f                                4\nafter a two-day jury trial and sentenced to 360 months’\nimprisonment. Id. In 2013, Murphy submitted two FOIA\nrequests to the EOUSA for “information and documents.”\nJoint Appendix (JA) 25, 31. His first FOIA request asked for:\n\n       disclosure of the dates that the grand jury\n       convened in reference to case # 1:08-CR-00433\n       and case # 1:08-CR-314 filed in U.S. District\n       Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\n       including the names [sic] of the Judge who\n       summoned the grand jury, the date the\n       indictments were returned, the date they were\n       discharged, the starting and ending date of the\n       grand jury’s term, and a certified copy of the\n       courts [sic] minute entries.\n\nId. at 39. Case number 08-CR-00433 is Murphy’s criminal\ncase and case number 08-CR-00314 is a criminal case\ninvolving Richard Byrd.\n\n    Approximately two months later, Murphy submitted a\nsecond FOIA request that sought:\n\n       disclosure of the dates the grand jury issued the\n       indictments pertaining to criminal No.\n       1:08-CR-314 and 1:08-CR-0433 . . . including\n       the dates and times of sessions the grand jury\n       convened, whether it was summoned pursuant\n       to Fed.

Before the EOUSA responded to his requests,\nMurphy filed suit in federal district court. 1 He challenged the\nEOUSA’s invocation of exemption 3 and alleged that the grand\njury indictments were inaccurate and that the EOUSA’s search\nfor records was inadequate. He asked the court to order the\nEOUSA to produce the “agency records previously requested\nby [him].” Am. Compl. ¶ 1.\n\n     After Murphy filed his complaint, the EOUSA responded\nto both of his FOIA requests. It first told Murphy that it\nintended to disclose “all records required to be released, or\nconsidered appropriate for release as a matter of discretion.”\nJA 45. These included “the date the grand jury was impaneled\nand expired; the name of the judge who supervised the grand\njury; [and] the date on which the grand jury was convened and\nreturned an indictment for each particular criminal case.” Id.\nat 37. It also disclosed that both of the “grand juries . . . were\nsummoned pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(a).” Id. at 47.\nOther than its disclosure of the date on which the grand jury\nissued indictments, the EOUSA declined to provide the\nspecific dates and “times the grand juries convened” between\nthe date of empanelment and the date each grand jury was\ndischarged “in order to protect the identity of witnesses and the\n\n1\n   Murphy properly filed suit before the EOUSA responded to his\nrequests because he had constructively exhausted his administrative\nremedies. “As a general matter, a FOIA requester must exhaust\nadministrative appeal remedies before seeking judicial redress.”\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Wash. v.

It held that\nMurphy’s claims regarding the accuracy of the records and the\nadequacy of the government’s search were premised on a\n“misunderstanding.” Id. at 5. According to the court,\nMurphy’s claim that some of the records were inaccurate and\nthat others did not disclose what he “expected to find” did not\namount to a FOIA violation. Id. It then found the EOUSA’s\ndeclaration, executed by EOUSA attorney advisor Kathleen\nBrandon, insufficient because it contained only one “obscure\nstatement” related to exemption 3. Id. at 6.

Because we hold that the\nEOUSA properly invoked exemption 3, we do not address whether it\nalso properly invoked exemption 7(C). See Larson v.

JA 42; see\nalso supra pp. 4–6 (describing Murphy’s FOIA requests and\nEOUSA’s response thereto). The EOUSA did not disclose that\ninformation to Murphy but did disclose it to the district court in\ncamera. See Murphy v.

The EOUSA\nalso disclosed the same material to this Court in camera. The\nEOUSA counsel confirmed in a post-argument letter to this Court\nthat the dates and times of day the grand jury met to consider\nMurphy’s and Byrd’s cases have not been disclosed to Murphy.\nTherefore, the only information in dispute—and the only\ninformation Murphy has not yet received—covers the dates and\ntimes of day the grand jury met to consider Murphy’s and Byrd’s\ncases as distinct from the dates the grand jury issued its indictments\nin the two cases.\n     What confusion may have existed is likely due to Murphy’s use\nof “convene.” “Convene” usually refers to the empanelment of the\ngrand jury. See Convene, BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed.\n2014) (“To call together, esp. for a formal meeting; to cause to\nassemble.”); see also, e.g., In re Sealed Case, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185071\"><a href=\"/opinion/185071/in-re-sealed-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 523\n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (independent counsel “convened a grand jury to\nconsider evidence”). The EOUSA disclosed that information to\nMurphy. JA 45 (releasing the date the grand jury was empaneled to\nMurphy). But he also asked for the “dates and times of sessions the\ngrand jury convened” to consider both his case and Byrd’s case. Id.\nat 42 (emphasis added). We take him to mean the dates and times\nthe grand jury met to consider evidence or to deliberate in his and\nByrd’s cases separate from the dates the grand jury indictments\nissued. Amicus agrees with our interpretation of Murphy’s FOIA\nrequest. See Amicus Br. 16 (Murphy has “the dates the grand juries\nbegan their sessions” but not the dates and times of day “the grand\njuries were in session” after empanelment).\n\f                               8\n     Both parties moved for reconsideration. See Murphy, 11\nF. Supp. 3d at 8. The EOUSA also filed a supplemental\ndeclaration, again executed by Brandon, in support of its\nmotion. The district court noted that Murphy’s motion for\nreconsideration contained the same arguments he had\npreviously made regarding the adequacy of the search and the\naccuracy of the records. See id. at 8–9. Because he did not\nidentify “an intervening change in the law,” “new evidence not\npreviously available” or “a clear error in the first order,” the\ndistrict court denied his motion. Id.\n\n     The district court, however, granted the EOUSA’s motion\nfor reconsideration after reviewing the withheld material in\ncamera and concluding that it “contain[ed] information that\nwould reveal secret aspects of a grand jury investigation.” Id.\nat 9. Additionally, the court held that the withheld material\nwas “inextricably intertwined” with non-exempt information,\nmaking it infeasible to segregate and produce any unprotected\ninformation. Id. Accordingly, it granted summary judgment\nto the EOUSA. Id. Murphy timely appealed. We appointed\namicus curiae to present arguments in support of Murphy’s\nposition.\n\n                              II\n\n     We review de novo the district court’s grant of summary\njudgment.

Cir. 2012)\n(alteration omitted). An agency can meet this burden by\nsubmitting “affidavits [that] describe the justifications for\nnondisclosure with reasonably specific detail” and\n\f                                   9\n“demonstrate that the information withheld logically falls\nwithin the claimed exemption.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 862.\nWe have emphasized that an agency’s task is not herculean.\nThe justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient if\nit “appears logical or plausible.” Id. (quotation marks\nomitted). We believe the EOUSA’s basis for invoking\nexemption 3 is both logical and plausible.\n\n     The EOUSA’s supplemental Brandon Declaration\nexplains why releasing the dates and times of day the grand\njury convened to consider Murphy’s and Byrd’s cases could\nreveal grand jury witness identities. Assume that a suspect\nknows his girlfriend witnessed the crime he is suspected of\ncommitting. Also assume (plausibly) that he can discover\nfrom friends or family members whether his girlfriend was\nabsent from work or school on a particular day and time.\nOnce convicted, the suspect wants to know whether his\ngirlfriend in fact provided testimony to the grand jury. If the\ngovernment discloses the dates and times of day that the grand\njury convened, he can compare those dates and times with his\ngirlfriend’s corresponding absences. If the grand jury met on\na day and time that his girlfriend missed school or work, he\ncould infer that she could have testified before the grand jury.\nSee JA 56–57 (providing similar example). 4\n\n\n4\n   This is not the only scenario that could involve a risk of disclosing\nthe identity of a grand jury witness. The same risk could occur if\nthe criminal defendant and the suspected grand jury witness are\ncellmates. Knowing when the grand jury met could provide an easy\nway for him to determine whether his cellmate was likely providing\ntestimony. If the grand jury met on a day and at a time that the\ncellmate was absent, the inference is plain: His cellmate could have\ntestified. Moreover, cellmates’ close proximity to one another\nenhances the opportunity for (and success of) retaliation, which\n\f                               10\n      The EOUSA’s position is all the more reasonable because\nit is based on extensive experience. The EOUSA declarant\nwas an assistant United States Attorney with more than twenty\nyears’ experience handling criminal cases in federal court. Id.\nat 56. She averred that she “went to great lengths” to keep\ngrand jury proceedings secret in order to “protect the identity\nof the witnesses.” Id. Secrecy is essential because, in her\nexperience, “defendants often went to great lengths to discover\nthe identity of witnesses in their cases, both before and after\ntrial.” Id. at 57. We cannot lightly brush aside both the logic\nand experience underlying the EOUSA’s decision to withhold\nthe requested information. Cf. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nDep’t of the Air Force, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186249\"><a href=\"/opinion/186249/mcdonnell-douglas-v-us-dept-air-frce/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1182</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190 (D.C.

Cir. 1982)\n(government affidavits explaining why material was classified\nwere entitled to deference because of affiants’ “experience”).\n\n     Granted, simply because an individual misses work or is\notherwise unaccountably absent does not mean we can be\ncertain that he provided testimony to a grand jury. But\nexemption 3 is not limited to circumstances that are certain to\nreveal a witness’s identity. Instead, the exemption is properly\ninvoked if “the disclosed material would tend to reveal some\nsecret aspect of the grand jury’s investigation, including the\nidentities of witnesses.” Hodge, 703 F.3d at 580 (emphasis\nadded; quotation marks omitted). A tendency need only make\na result more likely. See Tendency, OXFORD ENGLISH\nDICTIONARY (2d ed. 1989) (“leaning,” “inclination” or “bent\ntoward some . . . result”). The EOUSA has demonstrated how\n\nraises an even more compelling security concern than with someone\nwho is not confined with the defendant. See JA 56–57.\n\f                               11\ndisclosing the specific dates and times of day a grand jury met\nto consider a particular “matter” makes it more likely that a\nwitness’s identity can be discovered. See supra pp. 9–10; see\nalso Lopez, 393 F.3d at 1350 (“[R]evealing the dates of\npreliminary interviews conducted for the purposes of\n‘screening’ potential [grand jury] witnesses may in fact tend to\nreveal some secret aspect of the grand jury.” (emphasis added;\nsome quotation marks omitted)).\n\n     The EOUSA’s position also draws from the plausibility of\nits explanation for invoking exemption 3. It reasonably\nbelieves that a criminal suspect or defendant not only wants to\ndiscover a grand jury witness’s identity but that he may also\nwant to retaliate against that witness. See JA 57 (if\n“defendants . . . discover the identity of witnesses,” “that\nperson’s safety was in jeopardy”). Federal prosecutors are not\nthe only ones who believe that grand jury witnesses confront a\nrisk of retaliation; the Congress falls squarely in that camp as\nwell. That is why federal law prohibits tampering with or\nretaliating against witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (witness\ntampering unlawful); id. § 1513 (retaliation against witnesses\nunlawful). These laws are not a solution in search of a\nproblem; there are countless cases dealing with successful\ncriminal prosecutions for both witness tampering and witness\nretaliation. See, e.g., United States v. Wardell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1283 (10th Cir. 2009) (affirming conviction of “conspiring to\nretaliate against a witness” and “retaliating against a witness”);\nUnited States v.

The risk of retaliation against grand jury witnesses is one\nreason for maintaining grand jury secrecy. See United States\nv.

The government plainly has a\nstrong interest in witness safety.\n\n     While the consequence of disclosing information that\ntends to reveal the identity of grand jury witnesses is, by itself,\nsubstantial, that risk alone is not the only reason for protecting\nthe times and dates a grand jury considered evidence or\ndeliberated in a particular case. Disclosing the days and times\na grand jury met to consider evidence and hear testimony\nwould also reveal the content of grand jury deliberations by\ndisclosing how long a particular “matter occurr[ed] before the\ngrand jury,” FED. R. CRIM. P. 6(e), how much or how little\nevidence was weighed and which witnesses most occupied the\ngrand jury’s time. That information could shed light on the\nnature of the grand jury’s investigative and deliberative\nprocesses. Because disclosing the day-and-time information\nMurphy sought would tend to reveal the complexity and\n“scope, focus and direction of the grand jury investigations,”\n\f                                13\nthat information is protected from disclosure by Rule 6(e) even\nif no disclosure of witness identity or risk of retaliation exists.\nSee Fund for Constitutional Gov’t, 656 F.2d at 869.\n\n     Amicus offers several rejoinders. We find none of them\npersuasive. First, amicus argues that the supplemental\nBrandon Declaration is insufficient because it does not point to\nan actual case in which a witness’s identity was revealed after\ndisclosing the dates and times of day a grand jury met. But the\nbasis for invoking exemption 3 need only be “logical or\nplausible.” Larson, 565 F.3d at 862. A risk of harm is\nplausible even if the anticipated harm has not yet materialized.\nSee ACLU v. DOD, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184071\"><a href=\"/opinion/184071/american-civil-liberties-v-us-dept-of-defense/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[A]\nreviewing court must take into account that any affidavit or\nother agency statement of threatened harm . . . will always be\nspeculative to some extent, in the sense that it describes a\npotential future harm.” (quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)).\nLikewise, an explanation is no less plausible because it posits\npersuasive hypotheticals rather than real-world examples. Cf.\nMudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon v. ITC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506181\"><a href=\"/opinion/506181/mudge-rose-guthrie-alexander-ferdon-v-us-international-trade/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1532 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (suggesting agency could have\ncured insufficient FOIA affidavit by providing “hypothetical\nexamples”).\n\n    Second, amicus contends there is little risk that Murphy\ncould use the requested information to identify grand jury\nwitnesses because the grand juries convened five to seven\nyears ago. But there is no time limit on the secrecy of grand\njury proceedings. See Fund for Constitutional Gov’t, 656\nF.2d at 869 n.32 (“the chronological remoteness of grand jury\nproceedings bears no relevance to [a] FOIA inquiry” and “[t]he\ngeneral rule [of grand jury secrecy] admits to no exception for\nold grand jury proceedings”). Moreover, we have previously\ndecided FOIA cases seeking years-old grand jury information\nand not once intimated that the passage of time made Rule 6\n\f                              14\ninapplicable. See Hodge, 703 F.3d at 579 (2002 FOIA request\nseeking grand jury information related to 1985 conviction);\nLopez, 393 F.3d at 1347 (1997 FOIA requests seeking grand\njury information leading to 1990 indictment).\n\n     Amicus further claims that the information which we have\npreviously held to be covered by exemption 3 is different from\nthe date-and-time information that Murphy wants. Amicus\nstates that, notwithstanding that documents that include the\nname of a grand jury witness necessarily disclose his identity,\nthe same cannot be said for the dates and times of day a grand\njury meets. This argument misunderstands what is needed to\nsuccessfully invoke exemption 3. The test is whether “the\ndisclosed material would tend to reveal some secret aspect of\nthe grand jury’s investigation, including the identities of\nwitnesses.” Hodge, 703 F.3d at 580 (emphasis added).\n\n     Finally, amicus identifies three cases in which the Justice\nDepartment allegedly disclosed the dates and times of day a\ngrand jury convened to hear testimony. We find all three\ninapposite. In one, the Justice Department was ordered to\ndisclose “the date the grand jury convened, the date the\nindictment was returned or issued, and the date the grand jury\nwas discharged.” Hill v. DOJ, No. 11-cv-00273, ECF No. 29,\nat 8 (D.D.C. Dec. 19, 2011) (magistrate report and\nrecommendation). This information revealed nothing more\nthan when “the grand jury’s work began and ended.” Id.\nMurphy has this information for the two criminal cases\nidentified in his FOIA requests.\n\n     In the second case, the Justice Department declined to\ndisclose “the dates the grand jury convened.” Peay v. DOJ,\nNo. 04-cv-1859, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">788871</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (D.D.C. Mar. 14,\n2007). The district court denied the government’s summary\njudgment motion because its declaration did not explain “how\n\f                                  15\nthe disclosure of the dates the grand jury convened would tend\nto reveal a ‘secret aspect’ of the grand jury investigation.” Id.\nIn contrast, we have here the second Brandon Declaration.\n\n     Amicus also points to North v. DOJ, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2477627\"><a href=\"/opinion/2477627/north-v-us-dept-of-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(D.D.C. 2011), a district court case in which the Justice\nDepartment released “cover sheets and final pages of\ntranscripts of grand jury testimony . . . that indicated the date\nthat the testimony was given.” Id. at 220. The Justice\nDepartment had initially withheld the information; it was\nreleased only after the district court found its FOIA\ndeclarations wanting.        Compare North v. DOJ, No.\n08-cv-01439, ECF No. 17-1, at 6, ¶ 19 (D.D.C. Dec. 12, 2008)\n(categorically denying “entire [FOIA] request” because “all of\nthe materials requested were specifically identified as grand\njury materials”), with id. ECF No. 71-1, at 5, ¶ 14 (D.D.C. Apr.\n15, 2010) (releasing documents that “allow plaintiff to see\nwhen the proceedings took place since the redactions do not\ninclude the dates”). The Justice Department’s initial response\nin North is consistent with the EOUSA’s position here,\nnamely, that the dates and times of day the grand jury meets to\nconsider a specific case are protected by exemption 3. In any\nevent, North does not bind this court. 5\n\n\n5\n  Amicus also contends that the district court’s segregability analysis\nwas insufficient. We disagree. An agency can withhold records\nthat are exempt from disclosure under FOIA but it must produce\n“[a]ny reasonably segregable” portion thereof that does not fit one of\nthe statutory exemptions. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). Here, however, there\nis no segregability problem.           Murphy requested specific\n“information”—i.e., the dates and times of day the grand jury met to\nconsider his case and Byrd’s case. JA 25, 31. Once the EOUSA\ndeclined to disclose the requested information, there was nothing left\nto segregate. Cf. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. DOJ, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186559\"><a href=\"/opinion/186559/jud-watch-inc-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370\n\f                                 16\n    Finally, we address one remaining minor issue. In his\ninformal brief to this Court, Murphy requested an unredacted\ncopy of the indictment in Byrd’s case. Murphy admitted in\ndistrict court that the only redacted information in the Byrd\nindictment was the grand jury foreperson’s name and\nsignature. This information is plainly protected under\nexemption 3. See Hodge, 703 F.3d at 580 (exemption 3\nprotects information that would “tend to reveal some secret\naspect of the grand jury’s investigation, including the identities\nof . . . jurors” (quotation marks omitted)). Although the\nEOUSA has not invoked exemption 3 to protect the identity of\nthe grand jury foreperson, we can uphold ex mero motu\nnon-disclosure of information when ordering disclosure would\n“endanger the safety and privacy of third parties.” August v.\nFBI, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185935\"><a href=\"/opinion/185935/august-gregory-e-v-fbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 701 (D.C. Cir. 2003); see also id. (“The law\ndoes not require that third parties pay for the Government’s\nmistakes.”).\n\n    For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s judgment is\naffirmed.\n\n                                                        So ordered.\n\n\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2005) (segregability does not apply if “there simply are no\n‘reasonably segregable’ portions to release after deletion of the\nportions which are exempt.” (ellipsis and some quotation marks\nomitted)).\n     In addition, Murphy’s inadequate-search challenge fails\nbecause the adequacy of the search becomes a moot point if the\nrequested information is in fact found but not disclosed. See\nBlanton v. DOJ, 64 F. App’x 787, 788–89 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (per\ncuriam) (plaintiff’s challenge to adequacy of search was “moot”\nwhen agency “found th[e] [requested] documents”).\n\f</pre>",
