Plaintiff\n\n\n                alleged violations of the Michigan Civil Rights Act (CRA)1 and\n\n\n\n\n\n                        1\n                            MCL 37.2101 et seq.\n\n\fthe Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution2.\n\n\nThe trial court granted summary disposition for the city,\n\n\nfinding     plaintiff's   claims    barred   by   the   \"safe   harbor\"\n\n\nprovision of MCL 37.2210.          The Court of Appeals upheld the\n\n\ndismissal.3     238 Mich App 515; 606 NW2d 424 (1999). \n\n\n     It is beyond question that the safe harbor of the CRA\n\n\nshields a public employer with a Civil Rights Commission­\n\napproved affirmative action plan from liability under the CRA\n\n\nfor acts undertaken pursuant to that plan.              Principally at\n\n\nissue is whether the safe harbor provision also shields such\n\n\nan employer from constitutional equal protection challenges.\n\n\nWe hold that it does not.      We affirm in part the decision of\n\n\nthe Court of Appeals, reverse it in part, and remand the case\n\n\nto the trial court.\n\n\n                                    I\n\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n\n     Plaintiff wanted to be a firefighter with the city of\n\n\nLansing Fire Department. He believed himself qualified, since\n\n\nhe was a certified firefighter and the fire chief in Onondaga\n\n\nTownship.     For six consecutive years, 1990-1995, he applied\n\n\nfor a firefighter position with the city. Each time he was\n\n\n\n\n     2\n         Const 1963, art 1, § 2.\n\n     3\n      It reversed in part, allowing plaintiff to amend his\n\ncomplaint to claim discrimination based on residency. This\n\naspect of the ruling is not in dispute.\n\n\n                                    2\n\n\fdenied   employment.   He   believes   that   the   city   wrongfully\n\n\nrefused to hire him because he is a Caucasian male.\n\n\n     The reason for the repeated rejection, according to\n\n\nSharp, was the city's affirmative action plan.4 The plan was\n\n\nformally approved by the Civil Rights Commission in April\n\n\n1987, pursuant to § 210 of the CRA.      That provision generally\n\n\nencourages employers to implement voluntary affirmative action\n\n\nplans and sets forth a procedure for doing so. \n\n\n     Plaintiff sued the city, seeking damages, an injunction\n\n\nbarring further use of the affirmative action plan, and a\n\n\nposition with the city fire department. He argued that § 210\n\n\ndid not bar his claim and that the city's plan operated\n\n\nunconstitutionally with respect to him. Defendant disagreed\n\n\nand moved for summary disposition on the ground that the safe\n\n\nharbor of § 210 precluded all liability. The trial court\n\n\ngranted the motion before the close of discovery, relying on\n\n\nMCR 2.116(C)(8), (10). It concluded that the CRA provided the\n\n\nexclusive remedy for discrimination claims in the state and,\n\n\ntherefore, such a claim was barred in this instance.\n\n\n     The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of\n\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The details of the plan itself are not central to the\n\nquestions presented in this case. The stated goal of the plan\n\nwas to increase the percentage of minorities and women in the\n\nfire department, which was composed predominantly of white\n\nmales. In the interest of achieving its goal, the city made\n\nrace and gender factors in hiring decisions.\n\n\n                                 3\n\n\fsummary disposition, relying on Cole v General Motors Corp.5\n\n\nThe panel believed that it was bound by the precedent of Cole;\n\n\nbut disagreed with the reasoning employed there. It stated:\n\n\n           Because plaintiff does not challenge the\n\n      constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act itself,\n\n      but only the validity of defendant's affirmative\n\n      action plan and the actions of defendant employer,\n\n      we believe that the ruling in Cole effectively\n\n      resolves plaintiff's claim in this case. Were it\n\n      not for the Cole decision, however, we would reach\n\n      a different result. [238 Mich App 519.] \n\n\n      If working from \"a clean slate,\" the Court of Appeals\n\n\nmajority6 added, it would not interpret § 210 as providing\n\n\ndefendant employer with a shield from liability.          Instead, it\n\n\nwould have subjected the plan itself to constitutional review\n\n\nand would have held that § 210 does not \"automatically\" confer\n\n\nimmunity from statutory liability under the CRA.           We granted\n\n\nplaintiff's application for leave to appeal.\n\n\n      Plaintiff argues that the city's affirmative action plan\n\n\nshould not have been approved.            He asserts that the plan\n\n\ndelegates too much authority to the city by allowing the city\n\n\nto   make   changes   to   it   without   commission   approval.   He\n\n\ncontends, also, that the trial court erred by granting summary\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      236 Mich App 452; 600 NW2d 421 (1999). Cole provided\n\nthat an employer is insulated from liability under the CRA\n\nwhenever it is insulated under title VII, its federal\n\ncounterpart.\n\n      6\n      The per curiam opinion was signed by Court of Appeals\n\nJudges Michael J. Talbot and Jane E. Markey. Judge E. Thomas\n\nFitzgerald concurred in the result only.\n\n\n                                    4\n\n\fdisposition before discovery ended.              A genuine issue of fact\n\n\nexists, he argues, about whether the plan ever received\n\n\napproval from the commission.                Finally, he challenges the\n\n\nlower       court's   decision   that    §    210    completely      immunizes\n\n\ndefendant's actions taken in accordance with its approved\n\n\naffirmative action plan. \n\n\n                                      II\n\n\n                                 ANALYSIS\n\n\n        This case involves the interplay of the Equal Protection\n\n\nClause of our constitution and the statutory framework of the\n\n\nCRA.       Art 1, § 2 guarantees Michigan citizens the right to be\n\n\nfree from racial discrimination in employment by state actors.\n\n\nThat clause provides:\n\n\n             No person shall be denied the equal protection\n\n        of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the\n\n        enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be\n\n        discriminated against in the exercise thereof\n\n        because of religion, race, color or national\n\n        origin. The legislature shall implement this\n\n        section by appropriate legislation.\n\n\n        The CRA extended these protections to employment in the\n\n\nprivate       sector.   Thus,    it     prohibits      racial     employment\n\n\ndiscrimination by private and government employers7, while\n\n\n\n       7\n           Section 202 provides in pertinent part:\n\n\n            (1) An      employer      shall    not   do   any   of   the\n\n       following:\n\n\n            (a) Fail or refuse to hire or recruit,\n\n       discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an\n\n                                              (continued...)\n\n\n                                       5\n\n\fcreating a damages remedy8 for those victimized by unlawful\n\n\nemployment acts.\n\n\n     Section 210 of the CRA invites employers to implement\n\n\ntheir own affirmative action policies. Under this section, an\n\n\nemployer's actions that would otherwise violate the CRA are\n\n\npermissible,   provided   they    are   taken   pursuant   to   an\n\n\naffirmative action plan properly approved by the commission.\n\n\nSection 210 provides:\n\n\n          A person subject to this article may adopt and\n\n     carry out a plan to eliminate present effects of\n\n     past discriminatory practices or assure equal\n\n     opportunity with respect to religion, race, color,\n\n     national origin, or sex if the plan is filed with\n\n     the commission under rules of the commission and\n\n     the commission approves the plan.\n\n\n     We presume that the Legislature intended the unequivocal\n\n\nmeaning expressed in § 210. See Nation v WDE Electric Co, 454\n\n\nMich 489, 494; 563 NW2d 233 (1997). It provides a safe harbor\n\n\nfor public and private employers who act in accordance with\n\n\nproperly approved affirmative action plans. However, the safe\n\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      (...continued)\n\n     individual    with    respect     to    employment,\n\n     compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of\n\n     employment, because of religion, race, color,\n\n     national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or\n\n     marital status. [MCL 37.2202.]\n\n     8\n      Section 801(1) provides: \"A person alleging a violation\n\nof this act may bring a civil action for appropriate\n\ninjunctive relief or damages, or both.\" [MCL 37.2801.]\n\n\n                                 6\n\n\fharbor does not shield against all claims. It merely protects\n\n\nemployers from liability under the CRA for doing precisely\n\n\nwhat the statute itself invites them to do.\n\n\n     In   support   of   its   motion   for   summary    disposition,\n\n\ndefendant   presented    affidavits     showing   that    its   hiring\n\n\ndecisions had been made pursuant to an affirmative action plan\n\n\napproved by the Civil Rights Commission in 1987.            Plaintiff\n\n\ndoes not dispute that the commission approved defendant’s 1987\n\n\nplan. Rather, he argues that a genuine issue of material fact\n\n\nexists whether defendant actually used the approved plan in\n\n\nmaking hiring decisions between 1990 and 1995.              Plaintiff\n\n\ncontends that defendant followed different and unapproved\n\n\nplans when making the hiring decisions at issue. Moreover, he\n\n\nasserts, the commission \"exceeded its authority\" by giving to\n\n\ndefendant the discretion periodically to adjust its hiring\n\n\ngoals without commission approval.\n\n\n     The essence of plaintiff's position is that defendant's\n\n\nperiodic revision of its hiring goals after 1987 resulted in\n\n\nthe establishment of new affirmative action plans.          He argues\n\n\nthat these plans should have been submitted for commission\n\n\napproval.   However, plaintiff has offered no factual support\n\n\nfor his assertions.      Accordingly, he has failed to create a\n\n\ngenuine issue of material fact whether defendant relied on a\n\n\nseries of separate, unapproved plans in making the hiring\n\n\ndecisions at issue.      Moreover, he has not established that\n\n\n                                  7\n\n\ffurther discovery would uncover support for that assertion. \n\n\nTherefore, we reject his argument that summary disposition\n\n\nentered prematurely with respect to the CRA claim.\n\n\n     In a related vein, plaintiff suggests that the commission\n\n\nerred in failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of\n\n\nlaw when it approved defendant's affirmative action plan. \n\n\nPlaintiff did preserve the issue whether the commission was\n\n\nrequired under the Administrative Procedures Act, MCL 24.285,\n\n\nto make findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, for\n\n\nthe reasons set forth in the Court of Appeals decision, MCL\n\n\n24.285 is not applicable to this case.       238 Mich App 521.\n\n\nAccordingly, plaintiff has not preserved the issue whether the\n\n\ncommission was required under § 210 to make findings of fact\n\n\nand conclusions of law.      Thus, we conclude that the safe­\n\nharbor provision bars plaintiff's statutory claims against the\n\n\ncity.\n\n\n     But our inquiry does not end there.      A state actor is\n\n\ninvolved.    Consequently, the protections provided directly by\n\n\nthe state Equal Protection Clause come into play.       When an\n\n\naggrieved plaintiff alleges that a public employer denied his\n\n\nequal protection rights in violation of art 1, § 2, the\n\n\nemployer's     acts   are   subject   to   review   under   that\n\n\nconstitutional provision. Injunctive and declaratory relief\n\n\nare available to restrain any acts found to violate the state\n\n\n\n\n                                8\n\n\fEqual Protection Clause.9     Hence, the mere existence of an\n\n\napproved affirmative action plan does not insulate a state\n\n\nemployer, or its plan, from all judicial scrutiny.\n\n\n     In this case, plaintiff sought constitutional relief,\n\n\nalleging that defendant's affirmative action plan violates\n\n\nart 1, § 2.10     Defendant asserts that plaintiff did not\n\n\nvigorously pursue his constitutional theory either at trial or\n\n\nin the Court of Appeals.       It argues that such a lack of\n\n\npursuit constitutes an abandonment of the claim, regardless of\n\n\nhow it was pleaded.11 We disagree that plaintiff failed to\n\n\npursue his constitutional claim sufficiently.\n\n\n     Although   plaintiff's   presentation   of   this   issue   was\n\n\nsomewhat scattered, the record reveals that plaintiff did\n\n\nraise the issue at various stages of the litigation.        First,\n\n\nhe challenged the constitutionality of defendant's plan in his\n\n\nown motion for partial summary disposition, which was denied.\n\n\nNext, he raised the issue in his motion for reconsideration of\n\n\n\n\n     9\n\n         However, money damages are not available to an\n\naggrieved plaintiff under these circumstances. See Lewis v\n\nMichigan, 464 Mich __ ; ___ NW2d ___ (2001). \n\n     10\n      In his first amended complaint, plaintiff prayed that\n\nthe Ingham Circuit Court enter an order \"enjoining Defendant\n\ncity of Lansing from discriminating in employment on the basis\n\nof race, sex or national origin . . . .\" \n\n     11\n      Defendant characterizes plaintiff's claim as an effort\n\nto \"vindicate equal protection rights through the vehicle of\n\n[the CRA].\" Thus, according to defendant, there is no stand­\nalone claim for constitutional relief. \n\n\n                                9\n\n\fthe trial court's decision granting summary disposition to\n\n\ndefendant.      Finally, he raised it in the Court of Appeals.\n\n\nIndeed, the Court of Appeals itself acknowledged the issue.\n\n\nThe problem with the analyses of both the trial court and the\n\n\nCourt of Appeals is that the lower courts apparently assumed\n\n\nthat     §   210    alone      resolved        plaintiff’s    constitutional\n\n\nchallenge.\n\n\n       Hence, we find that plaintiff pleaded and pursued his\n\n\nconstitutional        theory       sufficiently    to    provide    notice    to\n\n\ndefendant of the claims against which it would have to defend.\n\n\nHaving preserved the issue, plaintiff is entitled to be heard\n\n\non his claim for injunctive relief.\n\n\n       The dissent’s conclusion that plaintiff’s constitutional\n\n\nchallenge is barred fails to appreciate that the safe harbor\n\n\nprovided by § 210 necessarily extends only to statutory claims\n\n\nunder    the   CRA.         There   is   simply    no    requirement   that    a\n\n\nplaintiff proceed through a statutory vehicle in order to seek\n\n\ndeclaratory or injunctive relief against an alleged violation\n\n\nof the state Equal Protection Clause.                      While the second\n\n\nsentence       of     art     1,     §   2     commits     its     affirmative\n\n\n“implementation” to the Legislature,12 the first sentence of\n\n\nthis constitutional provision commands that “[n]o person shall\n\n\n\n\n       12\n\n       For this reason, we hold today in Lewis, supra, that\n\nwe do not have authority to grant money damages or other\n\ncompensatory relief for past violations of art 1, § 2.\n\n\n                                         10\n\n\fbe denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any\n\n\nperson be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political\n\n\nrights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof\n\n\nbecause of religion, race, color, or national origin.”                     The\n\n\nduty imposed on the Legislature by the second sentence of\n\n\nart 1, § 2 to implement art 1, § 2 is not a power to\n\n\nultimately    define    the    substantive      meaning    of     the   first\n\n\nsentence.     Accordingly, while the state judiciary cannot\n\n\npositively    implement    art   1,    §   2,   the    judiciary    has    the\n\n\nlegitimate authority, in the exercise of the well-established\n\n\nduty of judicial review, to evaluate governmental action to\n\n\ndetermine if it is consistent with the equal protection\n\n\nguarantees of the first sentence of art 1, § 2 and to\n\n\ninvalidate such action if it is not.                In short, art 1, § 2\n\n\ncommands the Legislature to adopt measures to practically\n\n\nimplement     its      equal     protection         guarantees.           This\n\n\n“implementation” language does not mean that state and local\n\n\ngovernmental entities are free to violate the substantive\n\n\nequal protection guarantees of art 1, § 2 merely because the\n\n\nLegislature    has    failed   to     address   a     particular    type    of\n\n\nviolation.\n\n\n     Our dissenting colleague relies heavily on an analogy to\n\n\nfederal     law,    particularly      United    States     Supreme      Court\n\n\ndecisions related to employment discrimination claims against\n\n\nthe federal government. The dissent portrays this case law as\n\n\n                                    11\n\n\findicating that title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act\n\n\n(“title VII”) provides the exclusive remedy for employment\n\n\ndiscrimination by the federal government.           From this, the\n\n\ndissent argues in essence that state statutes should be held\n\n\nto provide the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination\n\n\nclaims against state or local government actors under state\n\n\nlaw.   As the dissent forthrightly acknowledges, this federal\n\n\ncase   law   can   only   be   persuasive   authority,   not   binding\n\n\nprecedent, in resolving the present case, which involves only\n\n\nquestions of state law.        We consider the dissent’s attempted\n\n\nanalogy to federal law to be unpersuasive.\n\n\n       The dissent analogizes the present case to Brown v\n\n\nGeneral Services Administration, 425 US 820; 96 S Ct 1961; 48\n\n\nL Ed 2d 402 (1976).       In particular, our dissenting colleague\n\n\nrelies on language in Brown “that § 717 of the Civil Rights\n\n\nAct of 1964, as amended, provides the exclusive judicial\n\n\nremedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment.”\n\n\nBrown, supra at 835.       However, as the dissent acknowledges,\n\n\nthe claims in Brown were all statutory.        Post at 9.      Thus, at\n\n\nmost, Brown can only stand for the proposition that the Civil\n\n\nRights Act of 1964 provides the exclusive statutory remedy for\n\n\ndiscrimination in employment by the federal government because\n\n\nBrown did not involve a constitutional issue. Moreover, Brown\n\n\nstated that even before the extension of title VII in 1972 to\n\n\n\n\n                                   12\n\n\fcover     federal   employees        “an     action   seeking    to    enjoin\n\n\nunconstitutional agency conduct would lie . . . .”                     Id. at\n\n\n826.    Accordingly, consistent with our holding in the present\n\n\ncase, Brown accepted as an established principle that a party\n\n\ncould     seek    injunctive        relief     against      unconstitutional\n\n\ngovernmental action.\n\n\n        The dissent also contends that, in Great American Savings\n\n\n& Loan Ass’n v Novotny, 442 US 366; 99 S Ct 2345; 60 L Ed 2d\n\n\n957 (1979), the United States Supreme Court “made clear that\n\n\nBrown’s reasoning extended to encompass the notion that title\n\n\nVII preempts constitutionally based claims as well.”                  Post at\n\n\n9.     We disagree because Novotny, a case with only private\n\n\nparties as litigants, did not involve any constitutional\n\n\nclaim.      In   Novotny,     the    male    plaintiff   alleged      that   he\n\n\nsuffered unlawful employment discrimination because he opposed\n\n\nhis    former    employer’s    practice       of   discriminating     against\n\n\nfemale employees on the basis of sex in violation of the\n\n\n“anti-retaliation”      provision       of    title   VII    prohibiting     an\n\n\nemployer from discriminating against an employee for opposing\n\n\na violation of title VII. In pertinent part, the plaintiff in\n\n\nNovotny attempted to bring suit against that employer and its\n\n\ndirectors under 42 USC 1985(3). Essentially, 42 USC 1985(3)\n\n\nwas the modern codification of a Reconstruction Era civil\n\n\nrights statute that generally provided a private cause of\n\n\n\n\n                                      13\n\n\faction   against   certain   conspiracies      to    violate   federally\n\n\nprotected rights.     The Novotny Court noted its concern that,\n\n\nif a violation of title VII could be asserted through this\n\n\nother statute, many of the provisions of title VII would be\n\n\navoided.      Accordingly, the Novotny Court declined to allow\n\n\nsuch a cause of action.\n\n\n      We consider the dissent’s effort to analogize the present\n\n\ncase to Novotny unpersuasive for two critical reasons. First,\n\n\ninasmuch as Novotny did not involve a governmental defendant,\n\n\nit did not involve any constitutional claim of violation of\n\n\nthe   equal    protection    guarantees   of        the   United   States\n\n\nConstitution. Second, the plaintiff in Novotny was attempting\n\n\nto redress conduct that was prohibited by title VII through\n\n\nanother, more generalized, federal statute, and his claim that\n\n\ntitle VII was violated was an essential aspect of his claim.\n\n\nIn contrast, while the present plaintiff cannot proceed under\n\n\nthe CRA because of the safe harbor provided by § 210, that\n\n\ndoes not mean that he cannot claim that the conduct at issue\n\n\nby the city of Lansing is violative of the state Equal\n\n\nProtection Clause.      Thus, Novotny is simply inapposite to\n\n\nwhether injunctive relief is available against governmental\n\n\naction that is unconstitutional if it is claimed that action\n\n\nviolates the constitutional equal protection guarantees.\n\n\n      The dissent further cites Davis v Passman, 442 US 228; 99\n\n\nS Ct 2264; 60 L Ed 2d 846 (1979), in support of its discussion\n\n\n                                 14\n\n\fof plaintiff’s constitutional claim.                  Post at 7.      However, we\n\n\nbelieve that Davis actually supports our analysis.                       In Davis,\n\n\na female employee of a member of congress was informed by him\n\n\nin a letter that she was removed from her position because he\n\n\nconcluded that it was “essential” that the position be held by\n\n\na    man.      At    that    time,     congressional        employees    like   the\n\n\npetitioner      in     Davis     were    not     protected     from     employment\n\n\ndiscrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act.                         See\n\n\nid. at 247 (“[w]hen § 717 was added to title VII to protect\n\n\nfederal employees from discrimination, it failed to extend\n\n\nthis protection to congressional employees such as petitioner\n\n\nwho are not in the competitive service”).                     The United States\n\n\nSupreme Court held that the plaintiff in Passman could bring\n\n\na cause of action directly under the Due Process Clause of the\n\n\nFifth       Amendment       on   the    basis    of   sex    discrimination      in\n\n\nviolation of its equal protection component.                     Id. at 242-244.\n\n\n       Properly understood then, Davis supports our treatment of\n\n\nthe constitutional claim in the present case.                     The plaintiff\n\n\nin    Davis    was    unable      to   seek     relief   under    the    generally\n\n\napplicable federal statute against employment discrimination\n\n\nbecause, as a congressional employee, she was not covered by\n\n\nthat statute.          Similarly, because of § 210, the state CRA\n\n\nprovides no recourse for a person who alleges that conduct by\n\n\na governmental employer pursuant to an affirmative action plan\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\n\fproperly approved under § 210 constitutes unconstitutional\n\n\nemployment discrimination in violation of art 1, § 2.                        In\n\n\neffect,      a   person   who   may      have    suffered    unconstitutional\n\n\nemployment discrimination under such a plan, assuming it is\n\n\nadopted      and    approved,       is     not     covered     by     the   CRA.\n\n\nNevertheless, as in Davis, such a person is able to directly\n\n\nchallenge the alleged constitutional violation.13                    Indeed, the\n\n\nDavis Court expressly stated that “this Court has already\n\n\nsettled that a cause of action may be implied directly under\n\n\nthe equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of\n\n\nthe Fifth Amendment in favor of those who seek to enforce this\n\n\nconstitutional right.”          Davis, supra at 242.           In support of\n\n\nthis principle, the Court referred to Bolling v Sharpe, 347 US\n\n\n497; 74 S Ct 693; 98 L Ed 884 (1954), in which the Court held\n\n\nthat     “equitable       relief”        was     available    to     plaintiffs\n\n\nchallenging racial segregation in the District of Columbia\n\n\nschools as violative of the Fifth Amendment. See Davis, supra\n\n\nat 242-243.        As the Davis Court noted, the action in Bolling\n\n\nwas predicated directly on the Fifth Amendment.                     Davis, supra\n\n\n\n\n       13\n\n        Of course, the type of relief that is directly\n\navailable for a violation of art 1, § 2 is different from the\n\naction for money damages against the federal government\n\navailable under Davis.     As we have discussed above, this\n\nCourt’s holding today in Lewis, supra, makes clear that there\n\nis no cause of action for money damages arising directly under\n\nart 1, § 2.     Rather, a plaintiff may seek injunctive or\n\ndeclaratory relief against the alleged constitutional\n\nviolation.\n\n\n                                         16\n\n\fat 243.    Thus, Bolling and Davis support a conclusion that\n\n\ninjunctive    relief    is   available    to   end    a    constitutional\n\n\nviolation without the need for any type of implementing\n\n\nstatute.14\n\n\n      The United States Supreme Court decision in Smith v\n\n\nRobinson, 468 US 992; 104 S Ct 3457; 82 L Ed 2d 746 (1984),\n\n\nalso fails to support Justice Kelly’s view that plaintiff may\n\n\nnot   directly   seek   injunctive      relief     under    the   Michigan\n\n\nConstitution.    Smith involved claims that a handicapped child\n\n\nwas denied a “free appropriate public education” in violation\n\n\nof,   in   pertinent    part,   the      federal     Education    of   the\n\n\nHandicapped Act (EHA), 20 USC 1400 et seq., and the federal\n\n\nEqual Protection Clause.         Smith, supra at 994-995.              The\n\n\npertinent issue in Smith was whether the petitioners could\n\n\nrecover attorney fees under 42 USC 1988, which generally\n\n\nallowed such a recovery in favor of plaintiffs seeking to\n\n\nenforce federal constitutional rights when the specifically\n\n\napplicable EHA, as then in effect, made no provision for\n\n\nawarding attorney fees.         The Court concluded that attorney\n\n\n\n\n      14\n       The dissent misapprehends our consideration of Bolling\n\nin stating that our use of that case “to predict the effects\n\nof a legislative act in 1972 evidences a remarkable twist of\n\nthe laws of time and space.” Post at 24, n 25. We do not in\n\nany way rely on Bolling as indicating the intent of Congress\n\nin making any amendments to title VII in 1972. Rather, we\n\nrely on Bolling as indicating that a court may directly grant\n\ninjunctive relief against a constitutional violation without\n\nregard to the content of any statute.\n\n\n                                  17\n\n\ffees could not be awarded under 42 USC 1988, because Congress\n\n\n“intended the EHA to be the exclusive avenue through which a\n\n\nplaintiff may assert an equal protection claim to a publicly\n\n\nfinanced    special    education.”      Smith,    supra    at     1009.\n\n\nAccordingly, the issue involved in Smith was actually one of\n\n\nstatutory     construction   or    application,   not     of    federal\n\n\nconstitutional law.     Thus, Smith does not support a view that\n\n\na   statute    may    preclude    injunctive   relief     to    end   a\n\n\nconstitutional violation.\n\n\n     Moreover, the Smith Court stated “where the EHA is\n\n\navailable to a handicapped child asserting a right to a free\n\n\nappropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on\n\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the\n\n\nEHA is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his\n\n\nparents or guardian can pursue their claim.”        Smith, supra at\n\n\n1013 (emphasis added).       At the very most, this can only\n\n\nreasonably be taken to support the view that, if a statutory\n\n\nremedy is available for an alleged constitutional violation,\n\n\na party may be required to seek to a remedy that alleged\n\n\nconstitutional violation through the procedures provided by\n\n\nthe statute.    However, as we have discussed above, plaintiff\n\n\ncannot challenge the alleged unconstitutional discrimination\n\n\nby defendant in this case under the CRA because of the\n\n\nimmunity provided by § 210 of the CRA.         Accordingly, because\n\n\nthe CRA is not available to plaintiff, Smith provides no\n\n\n                                  18\n\n\fsupport for a contention that plaintiff may not directly seek\n\n\ninjunctive relief under the Michigan Constitution.\n\n\n     Indeed, the Smith Court expressly stated:\n\n\n          There is no issue here of Congress’ ability to\n\n     preclude the federal courts from granting a remedy\n\n     for a constitutional deprivation. Even if Congress\n\n     repealed all statutory remedies for constitutional\n\n     violations, the power of federal courts to grant\n\n     the   relief    necessary   to    protect   against\n\n     constitutional deprivations or to remedy the wrong\n\n     done is presumed to be available in cases within\n\n     their jurisdiction. [Smith, supra at 1012, n 15.]\n\n\nThis language makes clear that the United States Supreme Court\n\n\nin Smith did not regard the legislative branch as having the\n\n\npower through a statute to foreclose the ability of the\n\n\njudicial branch to order an end to constitutional violations.15\n\n\n     Our dissenting colleague also attempts to analogize the\n\n\npresent     case   to    a    large   number   of   lower   federal   court\n\n\ndecisions, see post at 16-17, in support of her position with\n\n\nregard to plaintiff’s constitutional claim, while forthrightly\n\n\nacknowledging that “[s]ome federal circuits have held that\n\n\ntitle     VII   does    not   necessarily      provide   the   only   remedy\n\n\navailable for employment discrimination claims.”               Post at 16,\n\n\n\n\n     15\n       Consistent with our holding today in Lewis, supra, we\n\nreiterate that judicial authority under the state Equal\n\nProtection Clause is limited to providing injunctive or\n\ndeclaratory relief to nullify unconstitutional legislation or\n\notherwise stop a recurring violation of the state Equal\n\nProtection Clause.   As discussed in Lewis, because of the\n\nlanguage of the state Equal Protection Clause, any provision\n\nfor compensatory relief or similar measures to positively\n\nimplement the clause requires legislative action.\n\n\n                                       19\n\n\fn 23.     Given that we have already explained why we find the\n\n\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions on which the dissent\n\n\nrelies    inapposite        and       that      federal    law   can      at   most   be\n\n\npersuasive, not binding, authority in resolving the state law\n\n\nquestions involved in the present case, we will not burden\n\n\nreaders of this opinion with a further discussion of case law\n\n\nfrom the lower federal courts.\n\n\n      We note that the dissent indicates that it would not\n\n\nallow plaintiff to pursue “parallel constitutional claims to\n\n\nremedy wrongs cognizable under the CRA,” post at 28, which, in\n\n\nplain language, means that a discrimination plaintiff cannot\n\n\nsay, as this one effectively has, “I do not claim that the\n\n\nstatute is unconstitutional. I only claim the way the statute\n\n\nwas     used,        or   applied,         is      discriminatory         and,    thus,\n\n\nunconstitutional action has been engaged in by the state.”\n\n\nIn challenging such conduct as nevertheless constituting a\n\n\nviolation       of    art   1,    §    2     of    the    Michigan     Constitution,\n\n\nplaintiff is not asserting a claim that is “parallel” to an\n\n\nalleged    violation        of    the      CRA,     but   rather     is   seeking      to\n\n\ninvalidate       conduct     that       is      allegedly     prohibited         by   the\n\n\nMichigan Constitution even though it does not violate the act.\n\n\nSaid plainly, the unsettling position of the dissent is that,\n\n\nif the state actor (i.e., the city of Lansing in this case),\n\n\ncommits ongoing employment discrimination that violates the\n\n\nstate Equal Protection Clause, without also violating the CRA,\n\n\n                                             20\n\n\fthe courts, when petitioned by the employee, have no ability\n\n\nto put an end to the unconstitutional discrimination.                        In an\n\n\nera in which one of the noble contributions of the state and\n\n\nfederal       courts      has    been   to   give     citizens    aid     against\n\n\ndiscrimination, this is a startling proposition.\n\n\n     Our       dissenting        colleague     also    indicates      that    “the\n\n\nlanguage of the [CRA], case law, and the legislative record\n\n\npersuasively support the proposition that our Legislature\n\n\nintended the [act] to be the sole remedy for state employment\n\n\ndiscrimination claims in Michigan.”                   Post at 20.     While the\n\n\naccuracy of this assertion may well be debatable, it is also\n\n\nirrelevant because it is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot\n\n\ngrant a license to state and local governmental actors to\n\n\nviolate the Michigan Constitution.                     In other words, the\n\n\nLegislature cannot so “trump” the Michigan Constitution.\n\n\n        Indeed, the ultimate import of the dissent is that, at\n\n\nleast    in    the     present     context,    a    party    cannot     challenge\n\n\ndiscriminatory acts by a state actor in connection with its\n\n\napplication          or    use     of    a     statute      as     constituting\n\n\nunconstitutional           discrimination          under    the   state      Equal\n\n\nProtection Clause—at least one cannot do so without also\n\n\nattacking the validity of the underlying statute.                         This is\n\n\nprofoundly misbegotten because the power of judicial review\n\n\ndoes not extend only to invalidating unconstitutional statutes\n\n\nor other legislative enactments, but also to declaring other\n\n\n                                         21\n\n\fgovernmental action invalid if it violates the state or\n\n\nfederal constitution.\n\n\n       That judicial review of governmental action for its\n\n\nconstitutionality extends to governmental action in connection\n\n\nwith applying a statute, without requiring a review of the\n\n\nunderlying statute itself, is reflected in both modern and\n\n\nhistoric United States Supreme Court precedent.       In Batson v\n\n\nKentucky, 476 US 79, 89; 106 S Ct 1712; 90 L Ed 2d 69 (1986),\n\n\nthe Court held that the federal Equal Protection Clause\n\n\nforbids a prosecutor from using peremptory challenges to\n\n\nremove potential jurors on the basis of their race.            The\n\n\nBatson Court did not address whether the underlying provisions\n\n\nof the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure that allow a\n\n\nprosecutor to use peremptory challenges, see id. at 83, n 2,\n\n\nwere unconstitutional, or in any way suggest that they were.\n\n\nIn fact, the Court observed that it “has found a denial of\n\n\nequal protection where the procedures implementing a neutral\n\n\nstatute operated to exclude persons from the venire on racial\n\n\ngrounds.”     Id. at 88.    Likewise, in the present case, the\n\n\ncourts may review whether acts undertaken by the city of\n\n\nLansing pursuant to its affirmative action plan, which was\n\n\napproved by the Civil Rights Commission under § 210, are\n\n\nviolative of the state Equal Protection Clause without any\n\n\nneed    for   plaintiff    to   challenge   §   210   itself    as\n\n\nunconstitutional.\n\n\n                                22\n\n\f     Moreover, this is not new law.                  One need only refer to\n\n\nthe venerable, and celebrated, precedent of Yick Wo v Hopkins,\n\n\n118 US 356; 6 S Ct 1064; 30 L Ed 220 (1886), to understand\n\n\nthis.     Yick Wo involved two petitioners who were Chinese\n\n\ncitizens     and   who     were    imprisoned        upon   convictions     for\n\n\nviolating a San Francisco ordinance that required a person to\n\n\nobtain the consent of the local board of supervisors to run a\n\n\nlaundry business in a location other than a brick or stone\n\n\nbuilding.     Such consent was denied the petitioners and “200\n\n\nothers who have also petitioned, all of whom happen to be\n\n\nChinese subjects, [while] 80 others, not Chinese subjects, are\n\n\npermitted     to   carry    on    the     same      business     under   similar\n\n\nconditions.”        Id.    at     374.         In   light   of   this    obvious\n\n\ndiscrimination,      the        Court      considered       the     conclusion\n\n\nirresistible that the distinction was due to “hostility to the\n\n\nrace and nationality to which the petitioners belong.”                      Id.\n\n\nAccordingly, the Court held, without invalidating the San\n\n\nFrancisco ordinance, that the discrimination was violative of\n\n\nthe federal Equal Protection Clause and ordered the release of\n\n\nthe petitioners. Id. Of particular note in the present case,\n\n\nthe Court in Yick Wo stated:\n\n\n             Though the law itself be fair on its face, and\n\n        impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and\n\n        administered by public authority with an evil eye\n\n        and an unequal hand, so as practically to make\n\n        unjust and illegal discrimination between persons\n\n\n\n\n                                         23\n\n\f      in similar circumstances, material to their rights,\n\n      the denial of equal justice is still within the\n\n      prohibition of the constitution. [Id. at 373-374.]\n\n\nConsistent with this recognition, it is axiomatic, and has\n\n\nbeen for over a century, that the plaintiff here may challenge\n\n\nthe   particular     “application”      of    §    210   by    defendant   in\n\n\nconnection    with     defendant’s      affirmative       action     policies\n\n\nwithout     asserting    (or    considering)        whether      §   210   is\n\n\nconstitutional.\n\n\n      We note that our decision in this case certainly does not\n\n\ndeny substantial practical effect to § 210 of the CRA.16\n\n\nIndeed, we have held that plaintiff’s statutory claim under\n\n\nthe   Civil   Rights    Act    (and    with   it    the    possibility     of\n\n\nrecovering money damages or other compensatory relief) is\n\n\nbarred by § 210.         Further, plaintiff is able to bring a\n\n\nconstitutional claim under art 1, § 2 because the present\n\n\ndefendant, as a governmental entity, is directly bound to obey\n\n\nthe   equal   protection       guarantees     of    this      constitutional\n\n\nprovision.     At least generally, that would not be the case\n\n\nwith regard to a private employer that uses an affirmative\n\n\naction plan properly approved by the Civil Rights Commission\n\n\nunder § 210. See Woodland v Michigan Citizens Lobby, 423 Mich\n\n\n188, 205; 378 NW2d 337 (1985) (“The Michigan Constitution’s\n\n\nDeclaration of Rights provisions have never been interpreted\n\n\n\n      16\n\n        We note that the present case does not involve a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of § 210.\n\n\n                                      24\n\n\fas extending to purely private conduct; these provisions have\n\n\nconsistently been interpreted as limited to protection against\n\n\nstate action”); Harvey v Aetna Life Ins Co, 72 Mich App 285,\n\n\n287; 252 NW2d 471 (1976) (holding that the Equal Protection\n\n\nClause applies “to actions of the state and not to private\n\n\nconduct”).   Obviously, nothing in this opinion would prevent\n\n\nsuch a private employer from relying on § 210 as a bar to an\n\n\nemployment discrimination claim under the CRA.\n\n\n     Ultimately, the dissent would create a special rule for\n\n\nclaims of employment discrimination in violation of art 1, §\n\n\n2 (or at least for such claims in the affirmative action\n\n\ncontext) that would preclude a plaintiff from directly seeking\n\n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief against governmental action\n\n\nas being violative of this constitutional provision.   Rather,\n\n\nsuch a plaintiff would, if the dissent’s view were to prevail,\n\n\neither have to first establish a statutory violation or argue\n\n\nthat a state statute is unconstitutional in order to directly\n\n\nchallenge the alleged constitutional violation.     We see no\n\n\nappropriate basis for imposing such a heightened duty in this\n\n\ncontext.\n\n\n                             III\n\n\n                          CONCLUSION\n\n\n     We conclude that § 210 bars statutory liability under the\n\n\nCRA for employment discrimination where an employer acts in\n\n\naccordance with an affirmative action plan properly approved\n\n\n                             25\n\n\fby the commission.         The decisions of the trial court and the\n\n\nCourt     of   Appeals     dismissing     plaintiff's    CRA   claims    are\n\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n        The existence of the safe harbor does not abrogate rights\n\n\nguaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan\n\n\nConstitution.         We    hold   that    the   trial   court   erred    by\n\n\ndismissing plaintiff's constitutional claim for injunctive\n\n\nrelief.        Moreover, plaintiff has preserved this claim for\n\n\nappellate review. Therefore, the Court of Appeals decision on\n\n\nthe constitutional claim is reversed and the case is remanded\n\n\nto the trial court for consideration of plaintiff's prayer for\n\n\ninjunctive relief under art 1, § 2.\n\n\n        CORRIGAN , C.J., and CAVANAGH , WEAVER , TAYLOR , and YOUNG , JJ.,\n\n\nconcurred.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                     26\n\n\f                   S T A T E      O F     M I C H I G A N\n\n\n                               SUPREME COURT\n\n\n\n\n\nDAVID SHARP,\n\n\n        Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\n\nv                                                            No.     116171\n\n\nCITY OF LANSING,\n\n\n        Defendant-Appellee.\n\n\n\nMARKMAN, J. (concurring).\n\n\n        I concur in the result reached by the majority because I\n\n\nagree that § 210 shields a public employer with an affirmative\n\n\naction plan properly approved by the Civil Rights Commission\n\n\nfrom liability under the Michigan Civil Rights Act, MCL\n\n\n37.2101 et seq., but not necessarily from liability under the\n\n\nEqual Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution, Const\n\n\n1963, art 1, § 2.       Cf., however, Lewis v Michigan, 464 Mich \n\n\n    ;        NW2d           (2001).      Furthermore, I agree with the\n\n\nanalysis     set    forth    by    the    majority   in   reaching    this\n\n\nconclusion.\n\n\f     However, I write separately to observe that, in order for\n\n\nan affirmative action plan to be properly approved by the\n\n\nCivil    Rights   Commission,     it    must   comply    fully     with   the\n\n\nrequirements set forth in § 210.             Section 210's safe harbor\n\n\nencompasses only affirmative action plans that are “adopt[ed]\n\n\nand carr[ied] out . . . to eliminate present effects of past\n\n\ndiscriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity . . . .”\n\n\nMCL 37.2210.      Therefore, where the commission fails to apply\n\n\nthese standards in its examination of an affirmative action\n\n\nplan,    the   plan   has   not   been      properly    approved    by    the\n\n\ncommission.1\n\n\n        Because plaintiff has not preserved the issue whether the\n\n\ncommission complied with the requirements of § 210 when it\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       In observing that “a complainant could challenge the\n\ncommission’s approval of an affirmative action plan, arguing\n\nthat the plan fails to conform to criteria required by the CRA\n\nfor approval,” post at 30, the dissent apparently does not\n\ndisagree with this proposition. However, the dissent asserts\n\nthat my “sweeping interpretation, if accurate, would render\n\nthe safe-harbor provision unworkable.” Post at 31, n 30. I\n\nhave difficulty understanding why my view is a “sweeping\n\ninterpretation,” when I am merely quoting verbatim the\n\nstatutory language, i.e., “[a] person subject to this article\n\nmay adopt and carry out a plan to eliminate present effects of\n\npast discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity .\n\n. . .” MCL 37.2210. I agree with the dissent that the “safe\n\nharbor does not protect only those plans that succeed in\n\neliminating present effects of past discrimination.”       Id.\n\n(emphasis added).     Rather, the safe harbor protects all\n\nproperly approved plans that are “adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out\n\n. . . to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory\n\npractices or assure equal opportunity . . .”—but only such\n\nplans.\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\n\fapproved defendant’s affirmative action plan, the majority\n\n\ndoes not address this issue.       This silence, however, should\n\n\nnot mislead some to believe that the commission possesses\n\n\nplenary authority to shield from liability any affirmative\n\n\naction plan.   Rather, the commission is confined, not only by\n\n\nthe   requirements   of   the   constitution,   but   also   by   the\n\n\nrequirements of § 210 itself.      To reiterate, under § 210, the\n\n\ncommission only has the authority to approve, and thus to\n\n\nshield from liability under the Civil Rights Act, affirmative\n\n\naction plans that are “adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out . . . to\n\n\neliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or\n\n\nassure equal opportunity . . . .”2      Id.\n\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The significance of this unremarkable observation—that\n\nthe language of § 210 means what it says—arises largely in the\n\nevent that the constitutionality of § 210 is ultimately\n\nsustained, in particular, if predicated upon the premise that\n\nwhat would otherwise be unconstitutional, i.e., a hiring plan\n\nallowing   the   government-as-employer   to   treat   persons\n\ndifferently on account of religion, race, color, or national\n\norigin, is made constitutional by virtue of the standards set\n\nforth for affording an affirmative action plan a “safe\n\nharbor.” See City of Boerne v Flores, 521 US 507, 519; 117 S\n\nCt 2157; 138 L Ed 2d 624 (1997)(“Congress does not enforce a\n\nconstitutional right by changing what the right is. It has\n\nbeen given the power ‘to enforce,’ not the power to determine\n\nwhat constitutes a constitutional violation. Were it not so,\n\nwhat Congress would be enforcing would no longer be, in any\n\nmeaningful   sense, the     ‘provisions  of   the   Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.’”); Marbury v Madison, 5 US (1 Cranch) 137, 177; 2\n\nL Ed 60 (1803).\n\n\n                                 3\n\n\f                  S T A T E      O F   M I C H I G A N\n\n\n                                SUPREME COURT\n\n\n\n\n\nDAVID SHARP,\n\n\n      Plaintiff-Appellant,\n\n\nv                                                                No. 116171\n\n\nCITY OF LANSING,\n\n\n     Defendant-Appellee.\n\n___________________________________\n\nKELLY, J. (dissenting).\n\n\n      I agree with the majority that the safe-harbor provision1\n\n\nof   the     Michigan   Civil    Rights   Act    (CRA)2   bars    statutory\n\n\nliability under the CRA where an employer acts in conformity\n\n\nwith an approved affirmative action plan.             I also agree that\n\n\nthe mere existence of the safe harbor does not abrogate rights\n\n\ngenerally guaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\n\nMichigan Constitution.3         However, I cannot agree that acts of\n\n\nan employer that are protected by the safe harbor are subject\n\n\n\n      1\n          MCL 37.2210.\n\n      2\n          MCL 37.2101 et seq.\n\n      3\n          Const 1963, art 1, § 2.\n\n\fto an equal protection challenge pursued directly under art 1,\n\n\n§ 2.      Accordingly, because I believe that our Legislature\n\n\nintended the CRA to provide the exclusive remedy for public\n\n\nemployment discrimination claims within the act's purview, I\n\n\nregister my dissent.\n\n\n       Our constitution protects against discrimination at the\n\n\nhands of state actors by declaring that \"[n]o person shall be\n\n\ndenied    the   equal   protection     of     the       laws   .     .   .   .   The\n\n\nlegislature     shall     implement    this    section         by    appropriate\n\n\nlegislation.\" Const 1963, art 1, § 2 (emphasis added). We are\n\n\nbound    to   interpret    these   words      in    a    manner      that    gives\n\n\nsufficient effect to the \"law the people have made.\"                         People\n\n\nv Reichenbach, 459 Mich 109, 119; 587 NW2d 1 (1998).                             The\n\n\nstarting point for ascertaining the meaning of words used in\n\n\nthe constitution is to interpret them according to their plain\n\n\nand ordinary meaning as understood by the people who adopted\n\n\nthem.     Bond v Ann Arbor School Dist, 383 Mich 693, 699; 178\n\n\nNW2d 484 (1970).\n\n\n                I. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION        OF   1961\n\n\n        The reference to equal protection \"of the laws,\" found in\n\n\nboth the state and federal constitutions, suggests a safeguard\n\n\nagainst the formation and execution of laws or legislative\n\n\nclassification schemes that operate unequally.                       It is well\n\n\nsettled that the equal protection guarantee is not a source of\n\n\n\n                                      2\n\n\fsubstantive rights or liberties; rather, it is a measure of a\n\n\nconstitution's tolerance of government classification schemes.\n\n\nDoe v Dep't of Social Services, 439 Mich 650, 661; 487 NW2d\n\n\n166 (1992), citing San Antonio Ind School Dist v Rodriguez,\n\n\n411 US 1, 24; 93 S Ct 1278; 36 L Ed 2d 16 (1973).\n\n\n       It seems likely from the convention record that delegates\n\n\nat the Michigan Constitutional Convention of 1961 had this\n\n\nprinciple firmly in mind as they formed art 1, § 2. Delegates\n\n\nfrom    both    political      parties       viewed    the    proposed     equal\n\n\nprotection      clause    as   a   general      statement      of   Michigan's\n\n\npolicies and goals with respect to public discrimination.\n\n\nDrafters       of   art   1,   §   2,    envisioned         legislators,      not\n\n\nconstitutional delegates, as the authorities vested with the\n\n\npower to implement those goals.              James K. Pollock, Republican\n\n\nchairman of the Committee on Rights, Suffrage, and Elections\n\n\nfor    the   1961    convention,     observed         the    following   as    he\n\n\npresented his committee's proposed equal protection clause to\n\n\nthe delegation:\n\n\n            We felt that, in the event we wanted to have a\n\n       specific nondiscrimination clause, it would be\n\n       better to state as a general policy of the\n\n       constitution that there shall be no discrimination\n\n       based on race, religion or national origin in the\n\n       enjoyment of political or civil rights, and that\n\n       the legislature should have the power to enforce\n\n       this by appropriate legislation.

Don Binkowski,\n\n\nanother      Democratic     delegate        on       the     Pollock    committee,\n\n\ncharacterized the constitution as a guiding document that\n\n\n\"must point the way\" by providing a \"strong, resolute and bold\n\n\nrestatement of the principles on which this country has been\n\n\nfounded.\"      Id. at 746.        He concluded his remarks to the\n\n\ndelegation by observing \"[i]t is up to you to include in the\n\n\nnew constitution the statement of an individual's rights to\n\n\nequal    protection    of   the    law      .    .    .    and    to   provide   for\n\n\nlegislative implementation of these principles.\" Id.4\n\n\n                              II.

See, e.g., State Bd\n\n\nof Ed v Houghton Schs, 430 Mich 658; 425 NW2d 80 (1988).\n\n\n     There is no question that legislative bodies generally\n\n\npossess the power to enact detailed, comprehensive remedial\n\n\nlegislation that preempts parallel claims brought directly\n\n\nunder    a    constitution.    The    United   States   Supreme     Court\n\n\nexpressly recognized this fact in Smith v Robinson5, where it\n\n\nobserved:\n\n\n             In light of the comprehensive nature of the\n\n        procedures and guarantees set out in the [Education\n\n        of the Handicapped Act] and Congress' express\n\n        efforts to place on local and state educational\n\n        agencies the primary responsibility for developing\n\n        a plan to accommodate the needs of each individual\n\n        handicapped child, we find it difficult to believe\n\n        that Congress also meant to leave undisturbed the\n\n        ability of a handicapped child to go directly to\n\n        court with an equal protection claim to a free\n\n        appropriate public education. Not only would such a\n\n        result render superfluous most of the detailed\n\n        procedural protections outlined in the statute,\n\n        but, more important, it would also run counter to\n\n        Congress' view that the needs of handicapped\n\n        children are best accommodated by having the\n\n        parents and the local education agency work\n\n        together to formulate an individualized plan for\n\n        each handicapped child's education. No federal\n\n        district court presented with a constitutional\n\n        claim to a public education can duplicate that\n\n        process. \n\n\n        The   Smith   Court   held    that   the   Education   of     the\n\n\nHandicapped Act (EA) provided the exclusive avenue through\n\n\n\n     5\n      468 US 992, 1011-1012; 104 S Ct 3457; 82 L Ed 2d 746\n\n(1984).\n\n\n                                     5\n\n\fwhich the plaintiffs could assert an equal protection claim\n\n\nfor publicly funded special education.6          Justice Blackmun\n\n\nrecognized the possibility that broadly drafted legislation\n\n\ncould preempt an entire field of substantive law. The Supreme\n\n\nCourt further acknowledged that a comprehensive remedial act,\n\n\nsuch as the EA, will rightfully preclude the availability of\n\n\nparallel constitutional claims because such duplication would\n\n\nundermine the thoroughness of the statutory scheme.\n\n\n     I find highly persuasive here the reasoning employed by\n\n\nthe United States Supreme Court in Smith. It is the same\n\n\nrationale   that   backed   the   Court's   earlier   holdings   that\n\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The statute was later amended by Congress to allow\n\nstatutory and constitutional claims in tandem. Nevertheless,\n\nthe reasoning of Smith still stands for the proposition that\n\na comprehensive remedial scheme will preclude parallel\n\nconstitutional claims. See Zombro v Baltimore Police Dep't,\n\n868 F2d 1364, 1368 (CA 4, 1989)(using Smith for the\n\nproposition   that   \"[t]he  Supreme   Court   has   similarly\n\ndemonstrated a disinclination to entertain § 1983 actions in\n\nwhich plaintiffs have bypassed a comprehensive statutory\n\nremedy in favor of a § 1983 claim predicated on an alleged\n\nconstitutional violation\"); Mattoon v City of Pittsfield, 980\n\nF2d 1, 6 (CA 1, 1992)(relying on Smith for the conclusion that\n\n\"even assuming a 'fundamental constitutional right' to safe\n\npublic drinking water, it would not alter the present\n\nanalysis.

He filed a complaint with the\n\n\nGSA, then appealed to the federal Civil Service Commission,\n\n\nboth of which ruled against him. He then appealed from the\n\n\ncommission decision to a federal district court.

Brown v General\n\n\nServices Administration, 507 F2d 1300 (CA 2, 1974).\n\n\n       In deciding the case, the Supreme Court engaged in a\n\n\ndetailed review of the legislative history underlying the\n\n\nenactment of the 1972 amendments to title VII.                 It noted that\n\n\ncomprehensive administrative, judicial and remedial schemes\n\n\nhave been included there.          It viewed the enactment of § 717 as\n\n\nclear evidence of what Congress intended when it passed the\n\n\n1972    title      VII   amendments.          It   quoted   extensively   from\n\n\ncommittee reports and floor debates to ascertain the will of\n\n\nCongress, before concluding:\n\n\n            This unambiguous congressional perception\n\n       seems to indicate that the congressional intent in\n\n       1972 was to create an exclusive, pre-emptive\n\n       administrative and judicial scheme for the redress\n\n       of federal employment discrimination. [Brown, 425\n\n       US 828-829.]\n\n\n       Brown denounced the idea that circuitous pleading might\n\n\nenable a party to avoid the preemptive scheme set forth in\n\n\ntitle VII.         It observed that an attempt to circumvent the\n\n\ncommand       of   title   VII   would    defeat      Congress'   purpose   of\n\n\namending the statute in 1972. \n\n\n\n\n\n       15\n            42 USC 2000e-16 (title VII), as amended in 1972.\n\n\n                                         8\n\n\f          The crucial administrative role that each\n\n     agency together with the Civil Service Commission\n\n     was given by Congress in the eradication of\n\n     employment discrimination would be eliminated \"by\n\n     the simple expedient of putting a different label\n\n     on   (the)  pleadings.\"   It  would   require  the\n\n     suspension of disbelief to ascribe to Congress the\n\n     design to allow its careful and thorough remedial\n\n     scheme to be circumvented by artful pleading.\n\n     [Brown, 425 US 833, quoting Preiser v Rodriguez,\n\n     411 US 475, 489-490; 93 S Ct 1827; 36 L Ed 2d 439\n\n     (1973).]\n\n\nUltimately, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff's\n\n\nother     statutory   claims    were    preempted   by   title   VII.   It\n\n\naffirmed the lower courts and held:\n\n\n             [T]he established principle [found in Preiser]\n\n        leads unerringly to the conclusion that § 717 of\n\n        the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides\n\n        the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of\n\n        discrimination in federal employment. [Brown, 425\n\n        US 835.]\n\n\n        Though the remedies sought in Brown were all statutory,\n\n\nits holding was broader and unqualified.            In Novotny, supra,\n\n\nthe Supreme Court made clear that Brown's reasoning extended\n\n\nto   encompass        the    notion     that   title     VII     preempts\n\n\nconstitutionally based claims as well.              Novotny brought an\n\n\nequal protection claim through the vehicle of § 1985(3),16 and\n\n\nan action under § 704(a),17 the retaliatory discharge provision\n\n\nof title VII.     The Novotny Court relied on the principles set\n\n\nforth in Brown to hold that title VII foreclosed plaintiff's\n\n\n\n     16\n          42 USC 1985(3).\n\n     17\n          42 USC 2000e-3(a).\n\n\n                                       9\n\n\fequal protection claim.   It recognized that the availability\n\n\nof parallel constitutional relief, under these circumstances,\n\n\nwould dramatically undercut the effectiveness of title VII.\n\n\nComparing Novotny to Brown, the Supreme Court stated:\n\n\n          Here, the case is even more compelling.      In\n\n     Brown, the Court concluded that § 717 displaced\n\n     other causes of action arguably available to assert\n\n     substantive rights similar to those granted by §\n\n     717.   Section 1985(3), by contrast, creates no\n\n     rights. It is a purely remedial statute, providing\n\n     a civil cause of action when some otherwise defined\n\n     federal right--to equal protection of the laws or\n\n                   -\n     equal privileges and immunities under the laws--is\n\n                                                     -\n     breached by a conspiracy in the manner defined by\n\n     the section. Thus, we are not faced in this case\n\n     with a question of implied repeal.       The right\n\n     Novotny claims under § 704(a) did not even arguably\n\n     exist before the passage of Title VII. The only\n\n     question here, therefore, is whether the rights\n\n     created by Title VII may be asserted within the\n\n     remedial framework of § 1985(3). [Novotny, supra at\n\n     376.]\n\n\n     The Supreme Court answered this question in the negative.\n\n\nApplying   Brown's   holding   broadly,18   it   observed   that\n\n\n\n     18\n      The majority opinion relies on Davis, supra for the\n\nproposition that a constitutional claim can proceed where a\n\nplaintiff is not covered by title VII. This is accurate.\n\nHowever, in analogizing the specific facts of Davis to this\n\ncase, the majority overlooks the distinction that the claim at\n\nissue in Davis did not fall under the umbrella of title VII.\n\nThe plaintiff there, by virtue of her status as a\n\ncongressional employee, was not eligible for coverage under\n\ntitle VII. Thus, her ability to pursue a constitutional remedy\n\nwould not undercut title VII's remedial scheme. Indeed, the\n\nDavis Court reaffirmed Brown's exclusivity principle.\n\n\n     By contrast, this case involves an individual, Mr. Sharp,\n\nwho is protected by the applicable legislation, the CRA. He is\n\nnot barred by having a status that renders him outside the\n\n                                                (continued...)\n\n\n                               10\n\n\frestricting the plaintiff to an action under title VII was the\n\n\nonly way to preserve the integrity of title VII's remedial\n\n\nscheme. Notwithstanding Novotny's broad constitutional claims,\n\n\nthe Supreme Court continued:\n\n\n          If a violation of Title VII could be asserted\n\n     through § 1985(3) [in the form of a constitutional\n\n     claim], a complainant could avoid most if not all\n\n     of these detailed and specific provisions of the\n\n     law. . . . Perhaps most importantly, the complaint\n\n     could completely bypass the administrative process,\n\n     which plays such a crucial role in the scheme\n\n     established by Congress in Title VII. [Id. at 375­\n     376.]\n\n\n     The majority responds that Novotny \"did not involve any\n\n\nconstitutional claim[s]\" and therefore does not aid us in\n\n\ndetermining whether a statute can ever preempt a claim brought\n\n\ndirectly under the constitution.19   My colleagues acknowledge\n\n\nthat Novotny brought a claim under § 1985(3), but ignore the\n\n\nunderlying substantive posture of any action pursued through\n\n\nthe vehicle of § 1985(3).    Although § 1985 is certainly a\n\n\nstatute, it \"creates no rights,\" the Novotny Court observes,\n\n\nand is thus activated only \"when some otherwise defined\n\n\nfederal right--to equal protection of the laws or equal\n\n              -\n\n\n     18\n      (...continued)\n\nscope of its contemplation. His inability to state a\n\nsuccessful claim under the CRA does not place him in the same\n\nposition as the plaintiff in Davis. Factually speaking, he\n\nmore closely resembles the plaintiffs in Brown and Novotny,\n\nwhere the Supreme Court restricted access to alternative\n\nparallel remedies. Davis, supra at 247, n 26.\n\n     19\n          Slip op at 13.\n\n\n                             11\n\n\fprivileges and immunities under the laws--is breached by a\n\n                                         -\n\nconspiracy in the manner defined by the section.\"                               Novotny,\n\n\nsupra at 376. [Emphasis added.] \n\n\n     Hence,      §     1985   is    a    remedial         vehicle     to    pursue     the\n\n\nvindication      of     constitutionally                guaranteed    rights.          The\n\n\nNovotny    Court       was    unequivocal            when    it    declared      that    a\n\n\nviolation of rights contemplated under title VII could not be\n\n\nasserted through a § 1985(3) claim.                          Id. at 375-376.            It\n\n\nopined    that       pursuit       of    such       a     remedy    would      enable    a\n\n\ncomplainant to \"avoid most if not all of [the] detailed and\n\n\nspecific    provisions         of       the    law.\"      Id.      The     majority     is\n\n\ninaccurate in suggesting that using § 1985(3) to vindicate a\n\n\nviolation of a constitutional right is substantively different\n\n\nthan suing directly under the constitution. \n\n\n     The majority uses its flawed analysis of Novotny as a\n\n\nspringboard from which to leap to the general proposition that\n\n\na legislative act can never \"trump\" the constitution. Nowhere\n\n\nin Novotny can one locate the principle that the majority\n\n\nattributes    to       it.     Indeed,         when       the     Supreme      Court    has\n\n\naddressed        the     subject          of         statutory       preemption          of\n\n\nconstitutional          remedies,         it        has    reached       the    opposite\n\n\nconclusion.20        It cannot be accurately said that Novotny lends\n\n\n\n     20\n      See Smith v Robinson, n 6 supra, which lists federal\n\ncases that apply Smith in finding a statutory preemption of\n\n                                             (continued...)\n\n\n                                              12\n\n\fcredence to the conclusion that a constitutional claim can\n\n\nnever be preempted by statute. \n\n\n     The   majority   is   unpersuasive   in   its    attempt   to\n\n\ndistinguish Smith v Robinson, the Supreme Court case that\n\n\ndirectly addresses the principle of statutory preemption of\n\n\nparallel constitutional claims.21     As discussed above, the\n\n\nSmith Court held that a complainant's equal protection claim\n\n\nwas preempted by a statute, the EA.    The majority reads Smith\n\n\nto mean only that \"if a statutory remedy is available for an\n\n\nalleged constitutional violation, a party may be required to\n\n\nseek to remedy that alleged constitutional violation through\n\n\nprocedures provided by the statute.\"      Slip op at 18-19.     It\n\n\nthen finds that Miss Smith's claims were covered by the EA.\n\n\nand that Smith is inapposite here. \n\n\n     The flaw in its logic lies in its premise.      In Smith, the\n\n\nprinciple claim involved the right of a handicapped child to\n\n\na free public education.    The claim that went to the United\n\n\nStates Supreme Court was for attorney fees.     Under the facts\n\n\nin Smith, the plaintiff was covered by the act and was unable\n\n\n\n\n     20\n      (...continued)\n\nconstitutional claims.\n\n     21\n      The majority chooses not to \"burden the readers of this\n\nopinion with a further discussion of case law from the lower\n\nfederal courts,\" slip op at 17, but opts to ignore the\n\nconsiderable line of federal cases that have applied Smith to\n\nfind statutory preemption of constitutional claims. See n 6.\n\n\n                               13\n\n\fto obtain attorney fees under an equal protection claim.\n\n\nUnder the facts in Sharp, plaintiff was covered by the act and\n\n\nsought relief for various equal protection claims.               Hence, in\n\n\neach case a statutory remedy was available to and sought by\n\n\nthe plaintiff and the plaintiff sought relief, as well, for\n\n\nthe same alleged wrongs through a direct constitutional due\n\n\nprocess claim.    Consequently, Smith is pertinent and supports\n\n\nmy conclusion that a comprehensive legislative scheme can\n\n\npreempt certain constitutional claims where the Legislature is\n\n\nauthorized and intends to preempt an entire field of law. \n\n\n     In attempting to distinguish the holding in Smith from\n\n\nthe one I propose today, the majority points to a footnote in\n\n\nSmith. In it, the United States Supreme Court remarks that, if\n\n\nthere     were   no     statutory     remedies      for   constitutional\n\n\nviolations,\n\n\n        the power of federal courts to grant the relief\n\n        necessary   to  protect  against  constitutional\n\n        deprivations or to remedy the wrong done is\n\n        presumed to be available in cases within their\n\n        jurisdiction. [Id. at 1012, n 15, quoted ante at\n\n        19.]\n\n\nThis observation has no bearing on what the Court in Smith\n\n\nactually did decide:             when the Legislature implements a\n\n\ncomprehensive         remedial      scheme     to      rectify    certain\n\n\nconstitutional    equal     protection       rights,   the   scheme   will\n\n\npreempt parallel constitutional claims. \n\n\n\n\n                                     14\n\n\f     The footnote is dictum because the Smith Court found that\n\n\nCongress had implemented such a comprehensive remedial scheme\n\n\nin the EA. Examined closely, the footnote stands only for the\n\n\nproposition that, absent a statutory scheme to remedy equal\n\n\nprotection violations, courts can grant appropriate relief\n\n\ndirectly under the constitution. \n\n\n     This goes precisely to my point.          Indeed, if there were\n\n\nno title VII, or no EA, there certainly would exist a role for\n\n\nthe courts in remedying the constitutional deprivations those\n\n\nstatutes   address.         The    courts,    within   jurisdictional\n\n\nlimitations, would fill the void in legislation and right\n\n\nwrongs through claims brought directly under the constitution.\n\n\nYet the fact that Congress did enact such legislation is\n\n\nthought to manifest dissatisfaction with existing remedies the\n\n\ncourts were providing.        It is said to evidence a desire,\n\n\ninstead,   to     replace     unsuccessful      solutions     with   a\n\n\ncomprehensive scheme that preempts the field, including the\n\n\nvery preexistent constitutional claims that warranted the\n\n\nlegislation.    Hence, the holding of Smith is that the EA's\n\n\nlegislative history leads to the conclusion that the act \"is\n\n\nthe exclusive avenue through which the child and his parent or\n\n\nguardian can pursue their claim.\"          Id. at 1013.\n\n\n     Therefore,    despite        the    majority's    unsubstantiated\n\n\nassertion that a statute cannot \"trump\" the constitution,\n\n\n\n                                   15\n\n\ffederal courts have long acknowledged the opposite principle.22\n\n\nConsistent with the logic working in Smith, these courts have\n\n\napplied Brown and Novotny to hold that title VII preempts\n\n\nconstitutional equal protection claims that fall within the\n\n\njurisdiction of the statute23. See, e.g., Ethnic Employees of\n\n\nthe Library of Congress v Boorstin, 243 US App DC 186, 196;\n\n\n751   F2d   1405   (1985)(observing   that   \"[a]llowing   federal\n\n\nemployees to recast their title VII claims as constitutional\n\n\nclaims would clearly threaten those same policies\"); Day v\n\n\nWayne Co Bd of Auditors, 749 F2d 1199, 1204-1205 (CA 6, 1984);\n\n\nKizas v Webster, 227 US App DC 327, 345; 707 F2d 524 (1983)(a\n\n\nFifth Amendment claim based upon race and sex discrimination\n\n\n\n\n      22\n      As stated in n 6, numerous federal cases have cited\n\nSmith as authority for making the type of ruling that the\n\nmajority claims cannot be made. \n\n      23\n      Some federal circuits have held that title VII does not\n\nnecessarily provide the only remedy available for employment\n\ndiscrimination claims. See, e.g., Beardsley v Webb, 30 F3d\n\n524, 527 (CA 4, 1994). However, many of these decisions dealt\n\nwith claims arising from facts beyond the contemplation of\n\ntitle VII, such that recognizing them would not encroach upon\n\nthe area defined by title VII. \n\n\n     Even those circuits that have interpreted Brown narrowly\n\nhave not, as the majority suggests, done so on the basis of\n\nany distinction between legal and equitable remedies. See,\n\ne.g., Annis v Westchester Co, 36 F3d 251 (CA 2, 1994); Notari\n\nv Denver Water Dep't, 971 F2d 585 (CA 10, 1992). Instead, most\n\nhave so held on the basis that they disagree about the scope\n\nof coverage that Congress intended. The majority offers no\n\ncase holding that it is beyond the inherent power of any\n\nlegislative body to enact a statutory scheme that preempts\n\nparallel constitutional claims. \n\n\n                                16\n\n\fwas barred by title VII); Purtill v Harris, 658 F2d 134, 137\n\n\n(CA   3,    1981)(relying   on   Brown    to   hold     that   the   Age\n\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act, modeled after title VII,\n\n\npreempts judicial remedies based directly on the constitution\n\n\nfor claims of age discrimination in federal employment);\n\n\nLawrence v Staats, 214 US App DC 438, 439-441; 665 F2d 1256\n\n\n(1981) (a Fifth Amendment claim based on race discrimination\n\n\nwould be barred if § 717 applied); Davis v Califano, 198 US\n\n\nApp DC 224, 225, n 1; 613 F2d 957 (1979); Hofer v Campbell,\n\n\n189 US App DC 197, 200; 581 F2d 975 (1978)(a Fifth Amendment\n\n\nclaim based on national origin discrimination was barred by\n\n\ntitle VII); Richardson v Wiley, 186 US App DC 309, 310; 569\n\n\nF2d 140 (1977); Gissen v Tackman, 537 F2d 784, 786 (CA 3,\n\n\n1976); Lutes v Goldin, 62 F Supp 2d 118 (D DC, 1999); Brug v\n\n\nNat'l Coalition for the Homeless, 45 F Supp 2d 33, 42 (D DC,\n\n\n1999); Clement v Motta, 820 F Supp 1035 (WD Mich, 1991). \n\n\n      In Kizas, the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\n\nDistrict of Columbia rejected a reverse discrimination claim\n\n\nbrought by white clerical and support employees of the Federal\n\n\nBureau     of   Investigation.   The     complainants    alleged     that\n\n\nincluding affirmative action principles in the qualifying\n\n\nprocess for special agents violated their Fifth Amendment\n\n\nconstitutional right to equal protection as well as their\n\n\nstatutory title VII rights.        The court concluded that the\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\n\fplaintiffs' constitutional claim was \"unavoidably foreclosed\n\n\nby [the] precedent\" of Brown. Kizas, at 345.         Their sole\n\n\nremedy was under title VII.   The Kizas Court observed:\n\n\n          The Kizas complainants suggest, in repeated\n\n     but    less  than   lucid   argument,    that   the\n\n     Constitution's equal protection principle entails a\n\n     stricter restraint on classification by race or sex\n\n     than does Title VII and would shelter them against\n\n     \"reverse\" discrimination that the statute may\n\n     permit. We need not linger over this suggestion.\n\n     . . .\n\n\n          They may not circumvent the \"careful and\n\n     thorough remedial scheme\" Congress ordered for\n\n     them; their access to court is determined by that\n\n     effective, albeit demanding statute. [Kizas, at\n\n     345-346.]\n\n\n                         III. THE CRA\n\n\n     In the instant case, Sharp is covered by the protections\n\n\nafforded through the CRA--a legislative enactment every bit as\n\n                         -\n\ndetailed and comprehensive as its federal counterpart, title\n\n\nVII. \n\n\n     Section 717 contains a general prohibition of federal\n\n\nemployment \"discrimination based on race, color, religion,\n\n\nsex, or national origin.\" § 717(a).      Michigan's CRA contains\n\n\na proscription at MCL 37.2202(1), which provides in part:\n\n\n     An employer shall not . . . :\n\n\n          (a) Fail or refuse to hire, or recruit, or\n\n     discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an\n\n     individual    with    respect     to    employment,\n\n     compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of\n\n     employment, because of religion, race, color,\n\n     national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or\n\n     marital status.\n\n\n                              18\n\n\f      Section 717 also provides the Civil Service Commission\n\n\nwith the power and authority to enforce the civil rights\n\n\nrequirements of title VII. Michigan vests its own Civil Rights\n\n\nCommission with similar enforcement powers. Article 6 of the\n\n\nCRA   delegates   powers   and    duties    to   the    commission,      MCL\n\n\n37.2601,   and    the   Civil    Rights    Department,        MCL   37.2602.\n\n\nSection 602(c) establishes in the Department the authority to\n\n\n      [r]eceive,   initiate,   investigate,   conciliate,\n\n      adjust, dispose of, issue charges, and hold\n\n      hearings on complaints alleging a violation of this\n\n      act, and approve or disapprove plans to correct\n\n      past discriminatory practices which have caused or\n\n      resulted in a denial of equal opportunity with\n\n      respect to groups or persons protected by this act.\n\n\n      In addition, § 717(c) outlines a detailed administrative\n\n\ngrievance procedure that a complainant must follow before\n\n\nfiling suit in federal district court.           It gives an aggrieved\n\n\nfederal employee thirty days from a final order of the Civil\n\n\nService Commission to register an appeal in a district court.\n\n\n      Michigan's CRA provides an almost identical structure.\n\n\nSee MCL 37.2605-37.2606.          Section 605 requires the state\n\n\ncommission to issue written findings of fact and conclusions\n\n\nof law to support a conclusion that an employer has engaged in\n\n\ndiscriminatory     practices.      The    section      also    details   the\n\n\nvarious remedies available to the commission following a\n\n\nfinding of discrimination in violation of the CRA.                  Finally,\n\n\n§ 606 provides the complainant with the right to appeal from\n\n\n                                   19\n\n\fany final decision of the commission to a circuit court within\n\n\nthirty days. \n\n\n       The parallels that exist between title VII and the CRA\n\n\nare undeniable. Similarly, the concerns apparent in Brown and\n\n\nNovotny about parallel claims that threaten to dilute the\n\n\ncomprehensive scheme carefully crafted by Congress also exist\n\n\nhere.    Michigan's CRA provides the kind of detailed scheme\n\n\nthat the United States Supreme Court recognizes as providing\n\n\nthe    sole   remedy      for     claims    arising      under   its   coverage\n\n\numbrella.     \n\n\n                               IV. LEGISLATIVE INTENT\n\n\n       Moreover, the language of the act, case law, and the\n\n\nlegislative record persuasively support the proposition that\n\n\nour Legislature intended the CRA be the sole remedy for state\n\n\nemployment discrimination claims in Michigan.                     The primary\n\n\ngoal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give\n\n\neffect to the intent of the Legislature.                  Frankenmuth Mut Ins\n\n\nv Marlette Homes, Inc, 456 Mich 511, 515; 573 NW2d 611 (1998).\n\n\nLike    title     VII,    the     CRA   does    not   contain     an    express\n\n\ndescription       of     its     position      in   the    constellation     of\n\n\nantidiscrimination law.             Thus, it is appropriate to look for\n\n\nlegislative intent in other, less obvious places.                       Brown,\n\n\nsupra at 825.      \"Where the mind labours to discover the design\n\n\nof the legislature, it seizes everything from which aid can be\n\n\n\n                                        20\n\n\fderived . . . .\"     United States v Fisher, 6 US (2 Cranch) 358,\n\n\n386 (1805).\n\n\n     To begin, the language of the CRA itself manifests an\n\n\napparent intent to establish a broad, comprehensive scheme\n\n\nthat \"defines\" and remedies violations of civil rights.              The\n\n\npreamble to the CRA begins: \"An act to define civil rights\n\n\n. . . .\"      1976 PA 453 (emphasis added).             It continues by\n\n\ndescribing its own purpose as \"to prohibit discriminatory\n\n\npractices\" and \"to provide remedies and penalties . . . .\" Id.\n\n\nThus,    on   its   face,   the   CRA   shows    that   the   Legislature\n\n\nenvisioned it as comprehensive and detailed.\n\n\n        The legislative history, as gathered from House and\n\n\nSenate bill analyses generated before the act's passage in\n\n\n1976, bears out this suggestion.           The legislative documents\n\n\nexplain that the act was intended to address the problems\n\n\ncaused by the splintered remedial systems that existed before\n\n\n1976 in the area of civil rights.               The report accompanying\n\n\nHouse Bill 4055 described the bill as a consolidation of these\n\n\nconcepts into a single law that would\n\n\n        place legal and procedural recourse for all civil\n\n        rights discrimination within the Department of\n\n        Civil Rights, enabling the Department to provide\n\n        more effective remedies for those who have been\n\n        victimized by unlawful discrimination. [Emphasis\n\n        added.]\n\n\n        The bill analysis further describes the bill as a means\n\n\nof \"[outlining] more specifically the legal action a person\n\n\n                                    21\n\n\fcould take if that person feels that he or she has been\n\n\nunfairly discriminated against.\"           (Emphasis added.)      The\n\n\n\"Argument For:\" section of the bill analysis includes the\n\n\nfollowing two statements of purpose, both bearing particular\n\n\nrelevance to this case:\n\n\n           The bill would provide a uniform statutory\n\n      framework to deal with the many different forms of\n\n      discrimination. [Emphasis added.] \n\n\n                               * * *\n\n\n           The bill would include the concept of\n\n      discrimination enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court\n\n      with respect to equal protection under the\n\n      Constitution.\n\n\n      Hence,   the   CRA,   like   its   federal   counterpart,   was\n\n\nintended as a vehicle to define and consolidate the various\n\n\nremedial measures accorded by other statutes.          Moreover, it\n\n\nwas    envisioned     as    incorporating      the    \"concept    of\n\n\ndiscrimination\" inherent in the Equal Protection Clause.24\n\n\n      Courts have interpreted the CRA as bearing a singular\n\n\nobjective in harmony with the Michigan Constitution and as an\n\n\ninstrument to interpret and enforce its provisions. See, e.g.,\n\n\nThompson v Bd of Ed Romeo Comm Schs, 519 F Supp 1373, 1380 (WD\n\n\nMich, 1981) (interpreting Michigan law to conclude that the\n\n\n\n      24\n      The Equal Protection Clause of Michigan's Constitution\n\nis virtually identical to its counterpart contained in the\n\nFourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They\n\nare interpreted as embodiments of the same concepts. See,\n\ne.g., Moore v Spangler, 401 Mich 360, 370; 258 NW2d 34 (1977);\n\nNaudzius v Lahr, 253 Mich 216, 222; 234 NW 581 (1931).\n\n\n                                   22\n\n\f\"general object [of the CRA] is to define and protect certain\n\n\ncivil rights of individuals under the jurisdiction of Michigan\n\n\nlaw\"); Neal v Dep't of Corrections, 232 Mich App 730, 734; 592\n\n\nNW2d 370 (1998)(\"[t]he act is remedial and must be liberally\n\n\nconstrued to effectuate its ends\").\n\n\n       I find that the intent that appears to underlie the CRA\n\n\nsupports the proposition that the Legislature meant it to\n\n\nprovide the sole remedy for public employment discrimination\n\n\nclaims in Michigan.          Moreover, the United States Supreme\n\n\nCourt's decisive interpretation in Brown, Novotny, and their\n\n\nprogeny   of   the    breadth   of     §    717   of    title   VII   renders\n\n\nconvincing guidance in determining the breadth of Michigan's\n\n\nCRA.    Just as title VII provides the sole remedy for equal\n\n\nprotection claims involving federal governmental employment\n\n\ndiscrimination, the CRA provides the sole remedy for Michigan\n\n\ngovernmental employment discrimination.\n\n\n                                V. ANALOGY\n\n\n       A Michigan complainant like Mr. Sharp is in the same\n\n\nposition as the complainants in Kizas.                He may not circumvent\n\n\nthe    \"careful      and   thorough        remedial     scheme\"   that    the\n\n\nLegislature, in response to the direct call of the people, has\n\n\nordered for him. Kizas, at 346. His access to court \"is\n\n\ndetermined by that effective, albeit demanding, statute.\" Id.\n\n\nHe may not pursue a state constitutional equal protection\n\n\n\n                                      23\n\n\fclaim that falls within the purview of the CRA.25    Allowing\n\n\nthat a parallel and circuitous claim would dilute the CRA's\n\n\npurpose, just as allowing Novotny to seek constitutional\n\n\nredress would have diluted the carefully crafted scheme of\n\n\ntitle VII.\n\n\n     In addition to the persuasiveness of federal analogous\n\n\nlaw is the sheer counter intuitiveness of allowing an equal\n\n\nprotection claim to survive in this case.    If a complainant\n\n\nwere entitled to relief under the state Equal Protection\n\n\nClause as an alternative to the CRA, the safe harbor provision\n\n\n\n\n     25\n      The majority intimates that Lewis v Michigan, 464 Mich\n\n___; ___ NW2d ___ (2001), issued with this decision, holds\n\nthat a complainant has a direct claim under the constitution\n\nfor equitable relief from an approved affirmative action plan.\n\nSlip op at 15, n 13. The issue in Lewis is whether this Court\n\nshould recognize the existence of a claim for monetary damages\n\ndirectly under the Equal Protection Clause. It does not\n\naddress whether a party can seek equitable relief under the\n\nauspices of the constitution. \n\n\n     The majority miscasts my position in this dissent as one\n\nthat leaves certain Michigan citizens entirely without civil\n\nrights or constitutional protections. Also, it cites Bolling\n\nv Sharpe, 347 US 497; 74 S Ct 693; 98 L Ed 884 (1954) as\n\nassuming that Congress would amend title VII eighteen years\n\nlater to retain the availability of equitable relief directly\n\nunder the constitution. The use of a 1954 Supreme Court case\n\nto predict the effects of a legislative act in 1972 evidences\n\na remarkable twist of the laws of time and space. Moreover,\n\nBolling is inapposite because it describes federal employment\n\ndiscrimination remedies that existed before 1972. The 1972\n\namendments of title VII were aimed at altering the legal\n\nfoundation for pursuing federal employment discrimination\n\nclaims in the public sector. Brown, Novotny, Smith, and each\n\ncase upon which I rely, concern the state of employment\n\ndiscrimination law after 1972. \n\n\n                             24\n\n\fwould be dramatically weakened.            If the safe harbor were\n\n\ndestroyed,   the   CRA   would   fail     in   one   of   its   essential\n\n\npurposes:    to provide for affirmative action in order to\n\n\nalleviate past instances of discrimination. \n\n\n     In   turn,    the   delegates   to    the   1961     Constitutional\n\n\nConvention would have failed in their attempt to draft art 1,\n\n\n§ 2 as a set of policy goals \"pointing the way\" for the\n\n\nLegislature. Such a result is inconsistent with the expressed\n\n\npolicy goals of the constitutional framers and the intent of\n\n\nthe Legislature in enacting the CRA.           In addition, it ignores\n\n\nthe persuasive direction charted by the United States Supreme\n\n\nCourt in Brown,26 Novotny, and       their respective progeny. \n\n\n\n\n\n     26\n      To counter the unqualified, direct holding of Brown, the\n\nmajority relies on a misreading of it. Brown does not state\n\nthat the 1972 amendments to title VII left intact the\n\navailability of injunctive relief for federal employment\n\ndiscrimination directly under the Fifth Amendment. There is\n\nlittle question that the Brown Court regarded earlier remedies\n\nfor employment discrimination in the public sector as\n\nimpotent. See Brown, supra at 826 (\"If administrative remedies\n\nwere ineffective, judicial relief from federal employment\n\ndiscrimination was even more problematic before 1972.\")\n\nInjunctive relief, like the balance of remedies available\n\nbefore 1972, effected nothing to merit celebration among\n\nopponents of workplace discrimination. \n\n\n     According to the Brown Court, that was the weakness that\n\nCongress intended to address through the Equal Employment\n\nOpportunity Act of 1972. Its aim was to preempt the field by\n\nproviding a comprehensive, exclusive slate of remedies,\n\ndisplacing existing legal and equitable claims. I find that\n\nour Legislature intended the CRA to have similar preemptive\n\nforce.\n\n\n                                 25\n\n\f                  VI. SHARP 'S INADEQUATELY PLEADED CASE\n\n\n      A more detailed analysis of whether plaintiff has pleaded\n\n\nand   preserved    any   other   direct    constitutional   claim   is\n\n\nappropriate here. \n\n\n      MCR 2.111 provides:\n\n\n           (B) Statement of Claim. A complaint, counter­\n      claim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint must\n\n      contain the following:\n\n\n           (1) A statement of the facts, without\n\n      repetition, on which the pleader relies in stating\n\n      the cause of action, with the specific allegations\n\n      necessary reasonably to inform the adverse party of\n\n      the nature of the claims the adverse party is\n\n      called on to defend[.]\n\n\n      In his second amended complaint, plaintiff pleaded as\n\n\nfollows:\n\n\n           7. Notwithstanding rejection of Plaintiff's\n\n      application for employment as a fire fighter in the\n\n      Lansing fire department, Defendant city of Lansing\n\n      and the Lansing fire department have continued to\n\n      accept applications for employment and have\n\n      continued to hire persons as fire fighters who are\n\n      not certified fire fighters and not as well\n\n      qualified as Plaintiff.\n\n\n                                   ***\n\n\n           10. Defendant city of Lansing and its fire\n\n      department have limited, segregated or classified\n\n      plaintiff in a way that tends to deprive him of\n\n      employment opportunities in the public fire\n\n      department of the city of Lansing, or otherwise\n\n      adversely affects his status as an applicant\n\n      because of his race and sex.\n\n\n                                   ***\n\n\n           13. Defendant city of Lansing has adopted a\n\n      policy of discriminating in employment on the basis\n\n\n                                   26\n\n\fof race, sex and national origin by means of\n\ntreating white male applicants for employment less\n\nfavorably than applicants who are not white males.\n\n\n     14. Defendant city of Lansing has applied its\n\npolicy of discriminating in employment on the basis\n\nof race, sex and national origin to the Lansing\n\nfire department.\n\n\n     15. Defendant city of Lansing and its fire\n\ndepartment   have  manipulated   facially  neutral\n\ntesting procedures to discriminate on the basis of\n\nrace, sex and national origin by means of giving\n\nsecond, third and fourth chances to members of\n\nfavored races, sex or national origin.\n\n\n                       ***\n\n\n     18. Defendant city of Lansing obtained\n\napproval for a voluntary affirmative action plan in\n\n1987 but has abandoned the approved plan.\n\n\n     19. Defendant's affirmative action plan lacks\n\nany   rational   connection  with   a   legitimate\n\ngovernmental objective for the reason that ten\n\nyears of enforcement of the said voluntary\n\naffirmative action plan has had no effect on the\n\ndistribution of women and minorities in the non­\nsupervisory ranks of the Lansing fire department.\n\n\n     20. Defendant city of Lansing adopted both its\n\napproved voluntary affirmative action plan, and its\n\nunapproved voluntary affirmative action plan with\n\nintent to discriminate on the basis of race and\n\nsex. \n\n\n     21. The only effect of ten years of voluntary\n\naffirmative action in the Lansing fire department\n\nhas been to deprive white males of employment\n\nopportunities in the Lansing fire department. \n\n\n     22. Plaintiff has sustained damages in the\n\npremises in excess of $10,000.00, in violation of\n\nthe form of the Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act and\n\nConst 1963, art 1, § 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n                        27\n\n\f          Wherefore, Plaintiff prays that this Honorable\n\n     Court enter its order enjoining Defendant city of\n\n     Lansing from discriminating in employment on the\n\n     basis of race, sex or national origin . . . .\n\n\n     Plaintiff's     pleadings     acknowledge      the    apparent\n\n\nconstitutionality of an affirmative action plan that has been\n\n\napproved by the commission and enacted in conformity with\n\n\n§ 210. There is no dispute that the city's plan satisfies both\n\n\ncriteria. In his answer to defendant's affirmative defenses,\n\n\nplaintiff stated:\n\n\n          Plaintiff   affirmatively    avers   that   an\n\n     affirmative action plan may be adopted and carried\n\n     out \"if the plan is filed with the commission under\n\n     rules of the commission and the commission approves\n\n     the plan.\"\n\n\n     As   the   majority   concedes,   plaintiff   is   barred   from\n\n\npursuing a claim under the CRA.        By extension, then, he has\n\n\nfailed to state a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection\n\n\nClause of the Michigan Constitution.       Simply stated, he has\n\n\nnothing left to pursue on remand.\n\n\n     The majority misrepresents my position as asserting that\n\n\nthe only way to challenge a state actor's implementation of a\n\n\nlaw is to challenge the law itself.           It interprets this\n\n\ndissent as in conflict with Batson v Kentucky, 476 US 79; 106\n\n\nS Ct 1712; 90 L Ed 2d 69 (1986),27 and Yick Wo v Hopkins, 118\n\n\n\n\n     27\n      Batson held that the federal Equal Protection Clause\n\nforbids a prosecutor from using peremptory challenges to\n\nremove potential jurors because of race.\n\n\n                                 28\n\n\fUS 356; 6 S Ct 1064; 30 L Ed 220 (1886).28            In so doing, it\n\n\noverlooks a crucial fact that distinguishes Batson and Yick Wo\n\n\nfrom the instant case:        the relationship of the underlying\n\n\n\"law\" to the conduct alleged in this case is distinguishable\n\n\nfrom the relationship of those two variables as they operated\n\n\nin Batson and Yick Wo.         The key difference is that § 210\n\n\nexpressly allows the conduct in which defendant engaged.             It\n\n\npermits racial discrimination within certain parameters.             The\n\n\ncity of Lansing governed itself within those constitutional\n\n\nparameters.    Though he tried, Mr. Sharp could not establish a\n\n\nfactual issue to the contrary.\n\n\n      By   contrast,    the   underlying   law   in   Batson   did   not\n\n\nexpressly allow the conduct in which the Kentucky prosecutor\n\n\nengaged.     The \"law\" in Batson did not permit prosecutors to\n\n\nexercise peremptory challenges on the basis of race.            It did\n\n\nnot   even    address    race.      Thus,    the      unconstitutional\n\n\nimplementation at work in Batson was found in the \"deviation\"\n\n\nfrom what the underlying constitutional law would allow. That\n\n\n\"law\" had been applied to Batson in a way that denied him\n\n\nequal treatment under it.        I apply the same standard to Mr.\n\n\nSharp's claim, but reach a different result because the law in\n\n\n\n\n\n      28\n      The Yick Wo Court found an equal protection violation\n\nwhere an otherwise neutral San Francisco city ordinance was\n\napplied unequally to citizens on the basis of race. \n\n\n                                  29\n\n\fhis case operated exactly as legislators intended it should.29\n\n\nThere      was   no    deviation    from    the   scheme    intended   by   the\n\n\nMichigan Legislature.\n\n\n        However, despite Mr. Sharp's failure to articulate a\n\n\ncognizable        claim,    another        in   his    position    would    not\n\n\nnecessarily       be      without    a   remedy.       A   complainant     could\n\n\nchallenge the constitutionality of the CRA generally, or of\n\n\nthe     safe     harbor,    testing      whether      either   constitutes     a\n\n\nconstitutional implementation of art 1, § 2.                   Sharp chose not\n\n\nto do so.        Alternatively, a complainant could challenge the\n\n\ncommission's approval of an affirmative action plan, arguing\n\n\nthat the plan fails to conform to criteria required by the CRA\n\n\nfor approval.30 Again, Sharp chose not to pursue such a claim.\n\n\n\n      29\n      Similarly, in Yick Wo, the law at issue did not\n\nexpressly authorize discrimination on the basis of race. It\n\nestablished an approval process for operating certain types of\n\nlaundry businesses in San Francisco. The process was used to\n\ndeny business opportunities to Chinese immigrants, while\n\ngranting them to non-Chinese applicants. The \"law\" in Yick Wo\n\ndid not authorize city officials to treat Chinese applicants\n\ndifferently than others.    Rather, it established a neutral\n\npermitting process. City officials applied that law unequally,\n\nthereby violating the equal protection guarantee of the\n\nconstitution. Such a fact pattern is easily distinguishable\n\nfrom the instant case, where an admittedly constitutional\n\nstatute prescribes the very discrimination from which\n\nplaintiff claims to have suffered.\n\n      30\n      The concurrence is mistaken in its suggestion that I\n\nagree that the \"safe harbor encompasses only affirmative\n\naction plans that are 'adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out . . . to\n\neliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or\n\nassure equal opportunity . . . .'\" Slip op at 2. The safe\n\n                                               (continued...)\n\n\n                                         30\n\n\f     Finally, a complainant could articulate a challenge to a\n\n\npublic     employer's      actions    in     implementing      a   plan,    by\n\n\ndemonstrating that they fell outside the scope authorized by\n\n\n§ 210.    He could establish a fact question on such a claim by\n\n\nshowing, hypothetically, that the employer hired a minority\n\n\nfirefighter despite the fact that the individual had failed a\n\n\nrequired physical examination.              Hiring such a candidate, who\n\n\nwould     not   be   qualified      even     with   the    benefit     of   the\n\n\naffirmative action plan, would not fall within the protection\n\n\nof the safe harbor.          A complainant could establish a fact\n\n\nquestion whether the employer used some other unapproved plan,\n\n\nthereby violating complainant's rights.                  Such acts would not\n\n\nbe protected by the safe harbor and the complainant's art 1,\n\n\n§ 2 rights could be vindicated under the CRA. \n\n\n        Sharp attempted to create a fact question under certain\n\n\nof these theories, but failed.               Hence, he is now left with\n\n\nnothing by way of an action arising either under the CRA or\n\n\ndirectly    under    art   1,   §    2.     With    no    cognizable    claims\n\n\n\n     30\n      (...continued)\n\nharbor does not protect only those plans that succeed in\n\neliminating present effects of past discrimination. Section\n\n210 contemplates protection for any properly approved plan\n\nthat is reasonably created with the intention of eliminating\n\ndiscrimination or furthering equal opportunities in the\n\nworkplace. The section specifically refers to plans \"to\"\n\neliminate effects of discrimination, not plans \"that\" do in\n\nfact   eliminate   them.      The   concurrence's   sweeping\n\ninterpretation, if accurate, would render the safe-harbor\n\nprovision unworkable. \n\n\n                                      31\n\n\fremaining that have not already been discharged, his cause was\n\n\nproperly dismissed by the Court of Appeals.\n\n\n                          VII. CONCLUSION\n\n\n     I agree with the majority that the safe harbor protects\n\n\nthe city of Lansing from an action against it under the CRA.\n\n\nI further acknowledge that the Legislature cannot abrogate\n\n\nconstitutional rights through passage of a statute.      However,\n\n\nthe constitution can delegate authority.        The CRA is the\n\n\nLegislature's response to one such constitutional delegation\n\n\nof authority.   I believe that art 1, § 2, envisioned that the\n\n\nLegislature would pass an act like the CRA that could be the\n\n\nexclusive remedy for vindicating civil rights claims against\n\n\npublic employers in Michigan.     I base this conclusion on the\n\n\nexpressed   intent   of   certain     constitutional   convention\n\n\ndelegates and by analogy to a persuasive line of federal\n\n\nauthority regarding title VII and the federal equal protection\n\n\nclause.   The CRA closely resembles title VII that the United\n\n\nStates Supreme Court in Brown and Novotny held preempted the\n\n\nfield of employment discrimination claims under federal law.\n\n\n     Allowing the pursuit of parallel constitutional claims to\n\n\nremedy wrongs cognizable under the CRA is not only illogical,\n\n\nit threatens to undermine and destroy the comprehensive design\n\n\nof the statute.   Such a contrary ruling could not reflect the\n\n\nintent of either the Legislature in passing the act or the\n\n\n\n                                32\n\n\fpeople in adopting the Michigan Constitution. \n\n\n     The majority first misconstrues my position, then finds\n\n\nit \"a startling proposition.\"    Slip op at 18.      It states my\n\n\nposition as being that, if a state actor commits ongoing\n\n\nemployment   discrimination   violative   of   the   state   Equal\n\n\nProtection Clause but not violative of the CRA, the courts\n\n\ncannot end the discrimination.       My position is that, if a\n\n\nstate actor commits employment discrimination by performing\n\n\nacts covered by the CRA, the state Equal Protection Clause\n\n\ncannot be used to end the discrimination.\n\n\n     I have demonstrated that this proposition has extensive\n\n\nsupport in holdings of the United States Supreme Court.\n\n\nMoreover, a contrary holding, the majority's holding, sadly\n\n\nweakens the \"noble contributions of the state and federal\n\n\ncourts\" in fighting discrimination that it purports to esteem.\n\n\n     The majority states that my reading of the law allows the\n\n\nLegislature to \"trump\" the Michigan constitution.        It says\n\n\nthat \"it is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot grant a\n\n\nlicense to state and local governmental actors to violate the\n\n\nMichigan Constitution.\"   Slip op at 21.       However, a close\n\n\nexamination reveals that this is mere rhetoric and misses the\n\n\nmark.\n\n\n     Without dispute, the constitution can delegate to the\n\n\nLegislature the task of devising a comprehensive statutory\n\n\n\n                               33\n\n\fscheme to protect specific constitutional rights.            Art 1, § 2\n\n\ncontains such a constitutional provision, and it is the one\n\n\ninvolved in this case.       It is also beyond dispute that, when\n\n\none person's constitutional rights conflict with another's,\n\n\ncourts will render a decision whereby one right is sublimated\n\n\nto the other.\n\n\n      This dissent, simply stated, stands for the proposition\n\n\nthat, when a state actor discriminates against a person in a\n\n\nmanner made lawful by the CRA, that person's art 1, § 2 rights\n\n\nare sublimated to the art 1, § 2 constitutional rights of\n\n\nothers to have the state actor discriminate in their interest.\n\n\nArt 1, § 2 delegated to the Legislature the power to implement\n\n\nit.   In turn, the Legislature authorized the sublimation of\n\n\none person's equal protection rights over another's when it\n\n\ncreated § 210.\n\n\n      The majority also distorts the meaning of the dissent\n\n\nwhen it asserts that I would prevent the Court from hearing\n\n\nplaintiff's claim that defendant discriminated against him.\n\n\nIt states that the dissent would prevent plaintiff from\n\n\nrecovering for defendant's acts that, although not violative\n\n\nof the CRA, violate the Due Process Clause.             However, one\n\n\nshould note, it neglects to specify the acts. What conduct by\n\n\ndefendant does plaintiff claim violated art 1, § 2, but did\n\n\nnot   violate   the   CRA?    In   fact,   plaintiff   has    named   no\n\n\n\n                                   34\n\n\fgovernmental   action   by   defendant   that   survived   summary\n\n\ndisposition, or that should have, and that, also, violated the\n\n\nDue Process Clause.\n\n\n     Here, Sharp cannot sue under the CRA because of the bar\n\n\nimposed by § 210.       Both the nature of his claim and his\n\n\npleadings preclude the availability to him of a parallel\n\n\nconstitutional claim. The CRA provides his exclusive remedy.\n\n\nBecause the Court of Appeals properly dismissed this action,\n\n\nI would affirm.\n\n\n\n\n\n                                35\n\n\f",

Plaintiff alleged violations of the Michigan Civil Rights Act (CRA)<sup>[1]</sup> and the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution<sup>[2]</sup>. The trial court granted summary disposition for the city, finding plaintiff's claims barred by the \"safe harbor\" provision of M.C.L. § 37.2210. The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal.<sup>[3]</sup> 238 Mich. App. 515, 606 N.W.2d 424 (1999).</p>\n<p>It is beyond question that the safe harbor of the CRA shields a public employer with a Civil Rights Commission-approved affirmative action plan from liability under the CRA for acts undertaken pursuant to that plan. Principally at issue is whether the safe harbor provision also shields such an employer from constitutional equal protection challenges. We hold that it does not. We affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals, reverse it in part, and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff wanted to be a firefighter with the city of Lansing Fire Department. He believed himself qualified, since he was a certified firefighter and the fire chief in Onondaga Township. For six consecutive years, 1990-1995, he applied for a firefighter position with the city. Each time he was denied employment. He believes that the city wrongfully refused to hire him because he is a Caucasian male.</p>\n<p>The reason for the repeated rejection, according to Sharp, was the city's affirmative action plan.<sup>[4]</sup> The plan was formally approved by the Civil Rights Commission in April 1987, pursuant to § 210 of the CRA. That provision generally encourages employers to implement voluntary affirmative action plans and sets forth a procedure for doing so.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff sued the city, seeking damages, an injunction barring further use of the affirmative action plan, and a position with the city fire department. He argued that § 210 did not bar his claim and that the city's plan operated unconstitutionally with respect to him. Defendant disagreed and moved for summary disposition on the ground that the safe harbor of § 210 precluded all liability. The trial court granted the motion before the close of discovery, relying on MCR 2.116(C)(8), (10). It concluded that the CRA provided the exclusive remedy for discrimination claims in the state and, therefore, such a claim was barred in this instance.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of summary disposition, relying on <i>Cole v. General Motors Corp.</i><sup>[5]</sup> The panel believed that it was bound by the precedent of <i>Cole;</i> but disagreed with the reasoning employed there. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Because plaintiff does not challenge the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act itself, but only the validity of defendant's affirmative action plan and the</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*876</span> actions of defendant employer, we believe that the ruling in <i>Cole</i> effectively resolves plaintiff's claim in this case. Were it not for the <i>Cole</i> decision, however, we would reach a different result. [238 Mich.App. at 519, 606 N.W.2d 424.]</blockquote>\n<p>If working from \"a clean slate,\" the Court of Appeals majority<sup>[6]</sup> added, it would not interpret § 210 as providing defendant employer with a shield from liability. Instead, it would have subjected the plan itself to constitutional review and would have held that § 210 does not \"automatically\" confer immunity from statutory liability under the CRA. We granted plaintiff's application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff argues that the city's affirmative action plan should not have been approved. He asserts that the plan delegates too much authority to the city by allowing the city to make changes to it without commission approval. He contends, also, that the trial court erred by granting summary disposition before discovery ended. A genuine issue of fact exists, he argues, about whether the plan ever received approval from the commission. Finally, he challenges the lower court's decision that § 210 completely immunizes defendant's actions taken in accordance with its approved affirmative action plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>This case involves the interplay of the Equal Protection Clause of our constitution and the statutory framework of the CRA. Art 1, § 2 guarantees Michigan citizens the right to be free from racial discrimination in employment by state actors. That clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote>No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.</blockquote>\n<p>The CRA extended these protections to employment in the private sector. Thus, it prohibits racial employment discrimination by private and government employers<sup>[7]</sup>, while creating a damages remedy<sup>[8]</sup> for those victimized by unlawful employment acts.</p>\n<p>Section 210 of the CRA invites employers to implement their own affirmative action policies. Under this section, an employer's actions that would otherwise violate the CRA are permissible, provided they are taken pursuant to an affirmative action plan properly approved by the commission. Section 210 provides:</p>\n<p>A person subject to this article may adopt and carry out a plan to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity with respect to religion, race, color, national origin, or sex if the plan is filed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*877</span> with the commission under rules of the commission and the commission approves the plan.</p>\n<p>We presume that the Legislature intended the unequivocal meaning expressed in § 210. See <i>Nation v. W.D.E. Electric Co.,</i> 454 Mich. 489, 494, 563 N.W.2d 233 (1997). It provides a safe harbor for public and private employers who act in accordance with properly approved affirmative action plans. However, the safe harbor does not shield against all claims. It merely protects employers from liability under the CRA for doing precisely what the statute itself invites them to do.</p>\n<p>In support of its motion for summary disposition, defendant presented affidavits showing that its hiring decisions had been made pursuant to an affirmative action plan approved by the Civil Rights Commission in 1987. Plaintiff does not dispute that the commission approved defendant's 1987 plan. Rather, he argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists whether defendant actually used the approved plan in making hiring decisions between 1990 and 1995. Plaintiff contends that defendant followed different and <i>unapproved</i> plans when making the hiring decisions at issue. Moreover, he asserts, the commission \"exceeded its authority\" by giving to defendant the discretion periodically to adjust its hiring goals without commission approval.</p>\n<p>The essence of plaintiff's position is that defendant's periodic revision of its hiring goals after 1987 resulted in the establishment of new affirmative action plans. He argues that these plans should have been submitted for commission approval. However, plaintiff has offered no factual support for his assertions. Accordingly, he has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact whether defendant relied on a series of separate, unapproved plans in making the hiring decisions at issue. Moreover, he has not established that further discovery would uncover support for that assertion. Therefore, we reject his argument that summary disposition entered prematurely with respect to the CRA claim.</p>\n<p>In a related vein, plaintiff suggests that the commission erred in failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law when it approved defendant's affirmative action plan. Plaintiff did preserve the issue whether the commission was required under the Administrative Procedures Act, M.C.L. § 24.285, to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, for the reasons set forth in the Court of Appeals decision, M.C.L. § 24.285 is not applicable to this case. 238 Mich.App. at 521, 606 N.W.2d 424. Accordingly, plaintiff has <i>not</i> preserved the issue whether the commission was required under § 210 to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thus, we conclude that the safe-harbor provision bars plaintiff's statutory claims against the city.</p>\n<p>But our inquiry does not end there. A state actor is involved. Consequently, the protections provided directly by the state Equal Protection Clause come into play. When an aggrieved plaintiff alleges that a public employer denied his equal protection rights in violation of art. 1, § 2, the employer's acts are subject to review under that constitutional provision. Injunctive and declaratory relief are available to restrain any acts found to violate the state Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[9]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*878</span> Hence, the mere existence of an approved affirmative action plan does not insulate a state employer, or its plan, from all judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiff sought constitutional relief, alleging that defendant's affirmative action plan violates art. 1, § 2.<sup>[10]</sup> Defendant asserts that plaintiff did not vigorously pursue his constitutional theory either at trial or in the Court of Appeals. It argues that such a lack of pursuit constitutes an abandonment of the claim, regardless of how it was pleaded.<sup>[11]</sup> We disagree that plaintiff failed to pursue his constitutional claim sufficiently.</p>\n<p>Although plaintiff's presentation of this issue was somewhat scattered, the record reveals that plaintiff <i>did</i> raise the issue at various stages of the litigation. First, he challenged the constitutionality of defendant's plan in his own motion for partial summary disposition, which was denied. Next, he raised the issue in his motion for reconsideration of the trial court's decision granting summary disposition to defendant. Finally, he raised it in the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the Court of Appeals itself acknowledged the issue. The problem with the analyses of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals is that the lower courts apparently assumed that § 210 alone resolved plaintiff's constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p>Hence, we find that plaintiff pleaded and pursued his constitutional theory sufficiently to provide notice to defendant of the claims against which it would have to defend. Having preserved the issue, plaintiff is entitled to be heard on his claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The dissent's conclusion that plaintiff's constitutional challenge is barred fails to appreciate that the safe harbor provided by § 210 necessarily extends only to <i>statutory</i> claims under the CRA. There is simply no requirement that a plaintiff proceed through a statutory vehicle in order to seek declaratory or injunctive relief against an alleged violation of the state Equal Protection Clause. While the second sentence of art 1, § 2 commits its affirmative \"implementation\" to the Legislature,<sup>[12]</sup> the first sentence of this constitutional provision commands that \"[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color, or national origin.\" The duty imposed on the Legislature by the second sentence of art 1, § 2 to <i>implement</i> art. 1, § 2 is not a power to ultimately <i>define</i> the substantive meaning of the first sentence. Accordingly, while the state judiciary cannot positively implement art. 1, § 2, the judiciary has the legitimate authority, in the exercise of the well-established duty of judicial review, to evaluate governmental action to determine if it is consistent with the equal protection guarantees of the first sentence of art. 1, § 2 and to invalidate such action if it is not. In short, art. 1, § 2 commands the Legislature to adopt measures to practically implement its equal protection guarantees. This \"implementation\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*879</span> language does not mean that state and local governmental entities are free to violate the substantive equal protection guarantees of art. 1, § 2 merely because the Legislature has failed to address a particular type of violation.</p>\n<p>Our dissenting colleague relies heavily on an analogy to federal law, particularly United States Supreme Court decisions related to employment discrimination claims against the federal government. The dissent portrays this case law as indicating that title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act (\"title VII\") provides the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination by the federal government. From this, the dissent argues in essence that state statutes should be held to provide the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination claims against state or local government actors under state law. As the dissent forthrightly acknowledges, this federal case law can only be persuasive authority, not binding precedent, in resolving the present case, which involves only questions of state law. We consider the dissent's attempted analogy to federal law to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>The dissent analogizes the present case to <i>Brown v. General Services Administration,</i> 425 U.S. 820, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976). In particular, our dissenting colleague relies on language in <i>Brown</i> \"that § 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment.\" <i>Brown, supra</i> at 835, 96 S.Ct. 1961. However, as the dissent acknowledges, the claims in <i>Brown</i> were all statutory. <i>Post</i> at 889. Thus, at most, <i>Brown</i> can only stand for the proposition that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides the exclusive <i>statutory</i> remedy for discrimination in employment by the federal government because <i>Brown</i> did not involve a constitutional issue. Moreover, <i>Brown</i> stated that even before the extension of title VII in 1972 to cover federal employees \"an action seeking to enjoin unconstitutional agency conduct would lie....\" <i>Id.</i> at 826, 96 S.Ct. 1961. Accordingly, consistent with our holding in the present case, <i>Brown</i> accepted as an established principle that a party could seek injunctive relief against unconstitutional governmental action.</p>\n<p>The dissent also contends that, in <i>Great American Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Novotny,</i> 442 U.S. 366, 99 S.Ct. 2345, 60 L.Ed.2d 957 (1979), the United States Supreme Court \"made clear that <i>Brown's</i> reasoning extended to encompass the notion that title VII preempts constitutionally based claims as well.\" <i>Post</i> at 889. We disagree because <i>Novotny,</i> a case with only private parties as litigants, did not involve any constitutional claim. In <i>Novotny,</i> the male plaintiff alleged that he suffered unlawful employment discrimination because he opposed his former employer's practice of discriminating against female employees on the basis of sex in violation of the \"anti-retaliation\" provision of title VII prohibiting an employer from discriminating against an employee for opposing a violation of title VII. In pertinent part, the plaintiff in <i>Novotny</i> attempted to bring suit against that employer and its directors under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3). Essentially, 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) was the modern codification of a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute that generally provided a private cause of action against certain conspiracies to violate federally protected rights. The <i>Novotny</i> Court noted its concern that, if a violation of title VII could be asserted through this other statute, many of the provisions of title VII would be avoided. Accordingly, the <i>Novotny</i> Court declined to allow such a cause of action.</p>\n<p>We consider the dissent's effort to analogize the present case to <i>Novotny</i> unpersuasive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> for two critical reasons. First, inasmuch as <i>Novotny</i> did not involve a governmental defendant, it did not involve any constitutional claim of violation of the equal protection guarantees of the United States Constitution. Second, the plaintiff in <i>Novotny</i> was attempting to redress conduct that was prohibited by title VII through another, more generalized, federal statute, and his claim that title VII was violated was an essential aspect of his claim. In contrast, while the present plaintiff cannot proceed under the CRA because of the safe harbor provided by § 210, that does not mean that he cannot claim that the conduct at issue by the city of Lansing is violative of the state Equal Protection Clause. Thus, <i>Novotny</i> is simply inapposite to whether injunctive relief is available against governmental action that is unconstitutional if it is claimed that action violates the constitutional equal protection guarantees.</p>\n<p>The dissent further cites <i>Davis v. Passman,</i> 442 U.S. 228, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979), in support of its discussion of plaintiff's constitutional claim. <i>Post</i> at 888. However, we believe that <i>Davis</i> actually supports our analysis. In <i>Davis,</i> a female employee of a member of congress was informed by him in a letter that she was removed from her position because he concluded that it was \"essential\" that the position be held by a man. At that time, congressional employees like the petitioner in <i>Davis</i> were not protected from employment discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act. See <i>id.</i> at 247, 99 S.Ct. 2264 (\"[w]hen § 717 was added to title VII to protect federal employees from discrimination, it failed to extend this protection to congressional employees such as petitioner who are not in the competitive service\"). The United States Supreme Court held that the plaintiff in <i>Passman</i> could bring a cause of action directly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the basis of sex discrimination in violation of its equal protection component. <i>Id.</i> at 242-244.</p>\n<p>Properly understood then, <i>Davis</i> supports our treatment of the constitutional claim in the present case. The plaintiff in <i>Davis</i> was unable to seek relief under the generally applicable federal statute against employment discrimination because, as a congressional employee, she was not covered by that statute. Similarly, because of § 210, the state CRA provides no recourse for a person who alleges that conduct by a governmental employer pursuant to an affirmative action plan properly approved under § 210 constitutes unconstitutional employment discrimination in violation of art. 1, § 2. In effect, a person who may have suffered unconstitutional employment discrimination under such a plan, assuming it is adopted and approved, is not covered by the CRA. Nevertheless, as in <i>Davis,</i> such a person is able to directly challenge the alleged constitutional violation.<sup>[13]</sup> Indeed, the <i>Davis</i> Court expressly stated that \"this Court has already settled that a cause of action may be implied directly under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in favor of those who seek to enforce this constitutional right.\" <i>Davis, supra</i> at 242, 99 S.Ct. 2264. In support of this principle, the Court referred to <i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*881</span> 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954). in which the Court held that \"equitable relief\" was available to plaintiffs challenging racial segregation in the District of Columbia schools as violative of the Fifth Amendment. See <i>Davis, supra</i> at 242-243, 99 S.Ct. 2264. As the <i>Davis</i> Court noted, the action in <i>Bolling</i> was predicated directly on the Fifth Amendment. <i>Davis, supra</i> at 243, 99 S.Ct. 2264. Thus, <i>Bolling</i> and <i>Davis</i> support a conclusion that injunctive relief is available to end a constitutional violation without the need for any type of implementing statute.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court decision in <i>Smith v. Robinson,</i> 468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984), also fails to support Justice Kelly's view that plaintiff may not directly seek injunctive relief under the Michigan Constitution. <i>Smith</i> involved claims that a handicapped child was denied a \"free appropriate public education\" in violation of, in pertinent part, the federal Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. 1400 <i>et seq.,</i> and the federal Equal Protection Clause. <i>Smith, supra</i> at 994-995, 104 S.Ct. 3457. The pertinent issue in <i>Smith</i> was whether the petitioners could recover attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988, which generally allowed such a recovery in favor of plaintiffs seeking to enforce federal constitutional rights when the specifically applicable EHA, as then in effect, made no provision for awarding attorney fees. The Court concluded that attorney fees could not be awarded under 42 U.S.C. 1988, because Congress \"intended the EHA to be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert an equal protection claim to a publicly financed special education.\" <i>Smith, supra</i> at 1009, 104 S.Ct. 3457. Accordingly, the issue involved in <i>Smith</i> was actually one of statutory construction or application, not of federal constitutional law. Thus, <i>Smith</i> does not support a view that a statute may preclude injunctive relief to end a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the <i>Smith</i> Court stated <i>\"where the EHA is available</i> to a handicapped child asserting a right to a free appropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the EHA is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or guardian can pursue their claim.\" <i>Smith, supra</i> at 1013, 104 S.Ct. 3457 (emphasis added). At the very most, this can only reasonably be taken to support the view that, if a statutory remedy is available for an alleged constitutional violation, a party may be required to seek to a remedy that alleged constitutional violation through the procedures provided by the statute. However, as we have discussed above, plaintiff cannot challenge the alleged unconstitutional discrimination by defendant in this case under the CRA because of the immunity provided by § 210 of the CRA. Accordingly, because the CRA is <i>not</i> available to plaintiff, <i>Smith</i> provides no support for a contention that plaintiff may not directly seek injunctive relief under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the <i>Smith</i> Court expressly stated:</p>\n<p>There is no issue here of Congress' ability to preclude the federal courts from granting a remedy for a constitutional deprivation. Even if Congress repealed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*882</span> all statutory remedies for constitutional violations, the power of federal courts to grant the relief necessary to protect against constitutional deprivations or to remedy the wrong done is presumed to be available in cases within their jurisdiction. [<i>Smith, supra</i> at 1012, n. 15, 104 S.Ct. 3457.]</p>\n<p>This language makes clear that the United States Supreme Court in <i>Smith</i> did not regard the legislative branch as having the power through a statute to foreclose the ability of the judicial branch to order an end to constitutional violations.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Our dissenting colleague also attempts to analogize the present case to a large number of lower federal court decisions, see <i>post</i> at 892, in support of her position with regard to plaintiff's constitutional claim, while forthrightly acknowledging that \"[s]ome federal circuits have held that title VII does not necessarily provide the only remedy available for employment discrimination claims.\" <i>Post</i> at 892, n. 23. Given that we have already explained why we find the United States Supreme Court decisions on which the dissent relies inapposite and that federal law can at most be persuasive, not binding, authority in resolving the state law questions involved in the present case, we will not burden readers of this opinion with a further discussion of case law from the lower federal courts.</p>\n<p>We note that the dissent indicates that it would not allow plaintiff to pursue \"parallel constitutional claims to remedy wrongs cognizable under the CRA,\" <i>post</i> at 899, which, in plain language, means that a discrimination plaintiff cannot say, as this one effectively has, \"I do not claim that the statute is unconstitutional. I only claim the way the statute was used, or applied, is discriminatory and, thus, unconstitutional action has been engaged in by the state.\" In challenging such conduct as nevertheless constituting a violation of art. 1, § 2 of the Michigan Constitution, plaintiff is not asserting a claim that is \"parallel\" to an alleged violation of the CRA, but rather is seeking to invalidate conduct that is allegedly prohibited by the Michigan Constitution even though it does not violate the act. Said plainly, the unsettling position of the dissent is that, if the state actor (i.e., the city of Lansing in this case), commits ongoing employment discrimination that violates the state Equal Protection Clause, without also violating the CRA, the courts, when petitioned by the employee, have no ability to put an end to the unconstitutional discrimination. In an era in which one of the noble contributions of the state and federal courts has been to give citizens aid against discrimination, this is a startling proposition.</p>\n<p>Our dissenting colleague also indicates that \"the language of the [CRA], case law, and the legislative record persuasively support the proposition that our Legislature intended the [act] to be the sole remedy for state employment discrimination claims in Michigan.\" <i>Post</i> at 894. While the accuracy of this assertion may well be debatable, it is also irrelevant because it is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot grant a license to state and local governmental actors to violate the Michigan Constitution. In other words, the Legislature cannot so \"trump\" the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*883</span> Indeed, the ultimate import of the dissent is that, at least in the present context, a party cannot challenge discriminatory acts by a state actor in connection with its application or use of a statute as constituting unconstitutional discrimination under the state Equal Protection Clause at least one cannot do so without also attacking the validity of the underlying statute. This is profoundly misbegotten because the power of judicial review does not extend only to invalidating unconstitutional statutes or other legislative enactments, but also to declaring other governmental action invalid if it violates the state or federal constitution.</p>\n<p>That judicial review of governmental action for its constitutionality extends to governmental action in connection with applying a statute, without requiring a review of the underlying statute itself, is reflected in both modern and historic United States Supreme Court precedent. In <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 79, 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), the Court held that the federal Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from using peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors on the basis of their race. The <i>Batson</i> Court did not address whether the underlying provisions of the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure that allow a prosecutor to use peremptory challenges, see <i>id.</i> at 83, n. 2, 106 S.Ct. 1712 were unconstitutional, or in any way suggest that they were. In fact, the Court observed that it \"has found a denial of equal protection where the procedures implementing a neutral statute operated to exclude persons from the venire on racial grounds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Likewise, in the present case, the courts may review whether acts undertaken by the city of Lansing pursuant to its affirmative action plan, which was approved by the Civil Rights Commission under § 210, are violative of the state Equal Protection Clause without any need for plaintiff to challenge § 210 itself as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this is not new law. One need only refer to the venerable, and celebrated, precedent of <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886), to understand this. <i>Yick Wo</i> involved two petitioners who were Chinese citizens and who were imprisoned upon convictions for violating a San Francisco ordinance that required a person to obtain the consent of the local board of supervisors to run a laundry business in a location other than a brick or stone building. Such consent was denied the petitioners and \"200 others who have also petitioned, all of whom happen to be Chinese subjects, [while] 80 others, not Chinese subjects, are permitted to carry on the same business under similar conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 374,6 S.Ct. 1064.In light of this obvious discrimination, the Court considered the conclusion irresistible that the distinction was due to \"hostility to the race and nationality to which the petitioners belong.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the Court held, without invalidating the San Francisco ordinance, that the discrimination was violative of the federal Equal Protection Clause and ordered the release of the petitioners. <i>Id.</i> Of particular note in the present case, the Court in <i>Yick Wo</i> stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Though the law itself be fair on its face, and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimination between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the constitution. [<i>Id.</i> at 373-374, 6 S.Ct. 1064.]</blockquote>\n<p>Consistent with this recognition, it is axiomatic, and has been for over a century, that the plaintiff here may challenge the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*884</span> particular \"application\" of § 210 by defendant in connection with defendant's affirmative action policies without asserting (or considering) whether § 210 is constitutional.</p>\n<p>We note that our decision in this case certainly does not deny substantial practical effect to § 210 of the CRA.<sup>[16]</sup> Indeed, we have held that plaintiff's statutory claim under the Civil Rights Act (and with it the possibility of recovering money damages or other compensatory relief) is barred by § 210. Further, plaintiff is able to bring a constitutional claim under art. 1, § 2 because the present defendant, as a governmental entity, is directly bound to obey the equal protection guarantees of this constitutional provision. At least generally, that would not be the case with regard to a private employer that uses an affirmative action plan properly approved by the Civil Rights Commission under § 210. See <i>Woodland v. Michigan Citizens Lobby,</i> 423 Mich. 188, 205, 378 N.W.2d 337 (1985) (\"The Michigan Constitution's Declaration of Rights provisions have never been interpreted, as extending to purely private conduct; these provisions have consistently been interpreted as limited to protection against state action\"); <i>Harvey v. Aetna Life Ins. Co.,</i> 72 Mich. App. 285, 287, 252 N.W.2d 471 (1976) (holding that the Equal Protection Clause applies \"to actions of the state and not to private conduct\"). Obviously, nothing in this opinion would prevent such a private employer from relying on § 210 as a bar to an employment discrimination claim under the CRA.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the dissent would create a special rule for claims of employment discrimination in violation of art. 1, § 2 (or at least for such claims in the affirmative action context) that would preclude a plaintiff from directly seeking injunctive or declaratory relief against governmental action as being violative of this constitutional provision. Rather, such a plaintiff would, if the dissent's view were to prevail, either have to first establish a statutory violation or argue that a state statute is unconstitutional in order to directly challenge the alleged constitutional violation. We see no appropriate basis for imposing such a heightened duty in this context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We conclude that § 210 bars statutory liability under the CRA for employment discrimination where an employer acts in accordance with an affirmative action plan properly approved by the commission. The decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals dismissing plaintiff's CRA claims are affirmed.</p>\n<p>The existence of the safe harbor does not abrogate rights guaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution. We hold that the trial court erred by dismissing plaintiff's constitutional claim for injunctive relief. Moreover, plaintiff has preserved this claim for appellate review. Therefore, the Court of Appeals decision on the constitutional claim is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for consideration of plaintiff's prayer for injunctive relief under art. 1, § 2.</p>\n<p>CORRIGAN, C.J., and MICHAEL F. CAVANAGH, WEAVER, TAYLOR, and YOUNG, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*885</span> MARKMAN, J. <i>(concurring).</i></p>\n<p>I concur in the result reached by the majority because I agree that § 210 shields a public employer with an affirmative action plan properly approved by the Civil Rights Commission from liability under the Michigan Civil Rights Act, M.C.L. § 37.2101 <i>et seq.,</i> but not necessarily from liability under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution, Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2. Cf., however, <i>Lewis v. Michigan,</i> 464 Mich. 781, 629 N.W.2d 868 (2001). Furthermore, I agree with the analysis set forth by the majority in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p>However, I write separately to observe that, in order for an affirmative action plan to be <i>properly</i> approved by the Civil Rights Commission, it must comply fully with the requirements set forth in § 210. Section 210's safe harbor encompasses only affirmative action plans that are \"adopt[ed] and carr [ied] out ... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity....\" M.C.L. § 37.2210. Therefore, where the commission fails to apply these standards in its examination of an affirmative action plan, the plan has not been <i>properly</i> approved by the commission.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Because plaintiff has not preserved the issue whether the commission complied with the requirements of § 210 when it approved defendant's affirmative action plan, the majority does not address this issue. This silence, however, should not mislead some to believe that the commission possesses plenary authority to shield from liability <i>any</i> affirmative action plan. Rather, the commission is confined, not only by the requirements of the constitution, but also by the requirements of § 210 itself. To reiterate, under § 210, the commission only has the authority to approve, and thus to shield from liability under the Civil Rights Act, affirmative action plans that are \"adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out ... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity....\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*886</span> MARILYN J. KELLY, J. <i>(dissenting).</i></p>\n<p>I agree with the majority that the safe-harbor provision<sup>[1]</sup> of the Michigan Civil Rights Act (CRA)<sup>[2]</sup> bars statutory liability under the CRA where an employer acts in conformity with an approved affirmative action plan. I also agree that the mere existence of the safe harbor does not abrogate rights generally guaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution.<sup>[3]</sup> However, I cannot agree that acts of an employer that are protected by the safe harbor are subject to an equal protection challenge pursued directly under art. 1, § 2. Accordingly, because I believe that our Legislature intended the CRA to provide the exclusive remedy for public employment discrimination claims within the act's purview, I register my dissent.</p>\n<p>Our constitution protects against discrimination at the hands of state actors by declaring that \"[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.... <i>The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.\" </i> Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 (emphasis added). We are bound to interpret these words in a manner that gives sufficient effect to the \"law the people have made.\" <i>People v. Reichenbach,</i> 459 Mich. 109, 119, 587 N.W.2d 1 (1998). The starting point for ascertaining the meaning of words used in the constitution is to interpret them according to their plain and ordinary meaning as understood by the people who adopted them. <i>Bond v. Ann Arbor School Dist.,</i> 383 Mich. 693, 699, 178 N.W.2d 484 (1970).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1961</h2>\n<p>The reference to equal protection \"of the laws,\" found in both the state and federal constitutions, suggests a safeguard against the formation and execution of laws or legislative classification schemes that operate unequally. It is well settled that the equal protection guarantee is not a source of substantive rights or liberties; rather, it is a measure of a constitution's tolerance of government classification schemes. <i>Doe v. Dep't of Social Services,</i> 439 Mich. 650, 661, 487 N.W.2d 166 (1992), citing <i>San Antonio Ind. School Dist. v. Rodriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 1, 24, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973).</p>\n<p>It seems likely from the convention record that delegates at the Michigan Constitutional Convention of 1961 had this principle firmly in mind as they formed art. 1, § 2. Delegates from both political parties viewed the proposed equal protection clause as a general statement of Michigan's policies and goals with respect to public discrimination. Drafters of art. 1, § 2, envisioned legislators, not constitutional delegates, as the authorities vested with the power to implement those goals. James K. Pollock, Republican chairman of the Committee on Rights, Suffrage, and Elections for the 1961 convention, observed the following as he presented his committee's proposed equal protection clause to the delegation:</p>\n<blockquote>We felt that, in the event we wanted to have a specific nondiscrimination clause, it would be better to state as a general policy of the constitution that there shall be no discrimination based on race, religion or national origin in the enjoyment of political or civil rights, and <i>that the legislature should have the power to enforce this by appropriate legislation.</i> [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp. 741-742 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*887</span> To be sure, Delegate Harold Norris, a Democrat, expressed agreement with this basic principle of legislative delegation despite his disagreement with other aspects of the recommendation tendered by Pollock's committee. Professor Norris described the constitution as \"a statement of goals and not a detailing of means.\" <i>Id.</i> at 742, 93 S.Ct. 1278. Don Binkowski, another Democratic delegate on the Pollock committee, characterized the constitution as a guiding document that \"must point the way\" by providing a \"strong, resolute and bold restatement of the principles on which this country has been founded.\" <i>Id.</i> at 746, 93 S.Ct. 1278. He concluded his remarks to the delegation by observing \"[i]t is up to you to include in the new constitution the statement of an individual's rights to equal protection of the law... and to provide for legislative implementation of these principles.\" <i>Id.</i><sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. TITLE VII</h2>\n<p>We have long recognized that federal courts' interpretations of the law under circumstances analogous to those before us on review are highly persuasive although not necessarily binding on us. <i>Continental Motors v. Muskegon Twp.,</i> 365 Mich. 191, 194, 112 N.W.2d 429 (1961). See, e.g., <i>State Bd. of Ed. v. Houghton Schs,</i> 430 Mich. 658, 425 N.W.2d 80 (1988).</p>\n<p>There is no question that legislative bodies generally possess the power to enact detailed, comprehensive remedial legislation that preempts parallel claims brought directly under a constitution. The United States Supreme Court expressly recognized this fact in <i>Smith v. Robinson</i><sup>[5]</sup>, where it observed:</p>\n<blockquote>In light of the comprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees set out in the [Education of the Handicapped Act] and Congress' express efforts to place on local and state educational agencies the primary responsibility for developing a plan to accommodate the needs of each individual handicapped child, we find it difficult to believe that Congress also meant to leave undisturbed the ability of a handicapped child to go directly to court with an equal protection claim to a free appropriate public education. Not only would such a result render superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute, but, more important, it would also run counter to Congress' view that the needs of handicapped children are best accommodated by having the parents and the local education agency work together to formulate an individualized plan for each handicapped child's education. No federal district court presented with a constitutional claim to a public education can duplicate that process.</blockquote>\n<p>The <i>Smith</i> Court held that the Education of the Handicapped Act (EA) provided the exclusive avenue through which the plaintiffs could assert an equal protection claim for publicly funded special education.<sup>[6]</sup> Justice Blackmun recognized the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*888</span> possibility that broadly drafted legislation <i>could</i> preempt an entire field of substantive law. The Supreme Court further acknowledged that a comprehensive remedial act, such as the EA, will rightfully preclude the availability of parallel constitutional claims because such duplication would undermine the thoroughness of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>I find highly persuasive here the reasoning employed by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Smith.</i> It is the same rationale that backed the Court's earlier holdings that Congress intended title VII<sup>[7]</sup> to provide the exclusive judicial remedy for discrimination claims in the federal employment sector. See <i>Brown v. General Services Administration;</i><sup>[8]</sup><i>Great American Fed S &amp; L Ass'n v. Novotny</i>;<sup>[9]</sup><i>Davis v. Passman</i><i>.</i><sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Brown</i> involved an African-American federal government employee who claimed that the General Services Administration (GSA) had racially discriminated against him by failing to promote him to a higher grade. He filed a complaint with the GSA, then appealed to the federal Civil Service Commission, both of which ruled against him. He then appealed from the commission decision to a federal district court. The suit alleged jurisdiction under title VII as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972,<sup>[11]</sup> the general federal-question statute,<sup>[12]</sup> the declaratory judgment act<sup>[13]</sup> and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended.<sup>[14]</sup> The district court dismissed the entire action for failure to conform to the procedural requirements of § 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<sup>[15]</sup> The Court of Appeals affirmed. <i>Brown v. General Services Administration,</i> 507 F.2d 1300 (C.A.2, 1974).</p>\n<p>In deciding the case, the Supreme Court engaged in a detailed review of the legislative history underlying the enactment of the 1972 amendments to title VII. It noted that comprehensive administrative, judicial and remedial schemes have been included there. It viewed the enactment of § 717 as clear evidence of what Congress intended when it passed the 1972 title VII amendments. It quoted extensively from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*889</span> committee reports and floor debates to ascertain the will of Congress, before concluding:</p>\n<blockquote>This unambiguous congressional perception seems to indicate that the congressional intent in 1972 was to create an exclusive, pre-emptive administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of federal employment discrimination. [<i>Brown,</i> 425 U.S. at 828-829, 96 S.Ct. 1961.]</blockquote>\n<p><i>Brown</i> denounced the idea that circuitous pleading might enable a party to avoid the preemptive scheme set forth in title VII. It observed that an attempt to circumvent the command of title VII would defeat Congress' purpose of amending the statute in 1972.</p>\n<blockquote>The crucial administrative role that each agency together with the Civil Service Commission was given by Congress in the eradication of employment discrimination would be eliminated \"by the simple expedient of putting a different label on (the) pleadings .\" It would require the suspension of disbelief to ascribe to Congress the design to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to be circumvented by artful pleading. [<i>Brown,</i> 425 U.S. at 833, 96 S.Ct. 1961, quoting <i>Preiser v. Roriguez,</i> 411 U.S. 475, 489-490, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff's other statutory claims were preempted by title VII. It affirmed the lower courts and held:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he established principle [found in <i>Preiser</i> ] leads unerringly to the conclusion that § 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment. [<i> </i><i>Brown,</i> 425 U.S. at 835, 96 S.Ct. 1961.]</blockquote>\n<p>Though the remedies sought in <i>Brown</i> were all statutory, its holding was broader and unqualified. In <i>Novotny, supra,</i> the Supreme Court made clear that <i>Brown's</i> reasoning extended to encompass the notion that title VII preempts constitutionally based claims as well. <i>Novotny</i> brought an equal protection claim through the vehicle of § 1985(3),<sup>[16]</sup> and an action under § 704(a),<sup>[17]</sup> the retaliatory discharge provision of title VII. The <i>Novotny</i> Court relied on the principles set forth in <i>Brown</i> to hold that title VII foreclosed plaintiff's equal protection claim. It recognized that the availability of parallel constitutional relief, under these circumstances, would dramatically undercut the effectiveness of title VII. Comparing <i>Novotny</i> to <i>Brown,</i> the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p>Here, the case is even more compelling. In <i>Brown,</i> the Court concluded that § 717 displaced other causes of action arguably available to assert substantive rights similar to those granted by § 717. Section 1985(3), by contrast, creates no rights. It is a purely remedial statute, providing a civil cause of action when some otherwise defined federal rightto equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under the lawsis breached by a conspiracy in the manner defined by the section. Thus, we are not faced in this case with a question of implied repeal. The right Novotny claims under § 704(a) did not even arguably exist before the passage of Title VII. The only question here, therefore, is whether the rights created by Title VII may be asserted within the remedial framework of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*890</span> § 1985(3). [<i>Novotny, supra</i> at 376, 99 S.Ct. 2345.]</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court answered this question in the negative. Applying <i>Brown's</i> holding broadly,<sup>[18]</sup> it observed that restricting the plaintiff to an action under title VII was the only way to preserve the integrity of title VII's remedial scheme. Notwithstanding <i>Novotny's</i> broad constitutional claims, the Supreme Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote>If a violation of Title VII could be asserted through § 1985(3) [in the form of a constitutional claim], a complainant could avoid most if not all of these detailed and specific provisions of the law.... Perhaps most importantly, the complaint could completely bypass the administrative process, which plays such a crucial role in the scheme established by Congress in Title VII. [<i>Id.</i> at 375-376, 99 S.Ct. 2345.]</blockquote>\n<p>The majority responds that <i>Novotny</i> \"did not involve any constitutional claim[s]\" and therefore does not aid us in determining whether a statute can ever preempt a claim brought directly under the constitution.<sup>[19]</sup> My colleagues acknowledge that <i>Novotny</i> brought a claim under § 1985(3), but ignore the underlying substantive posture of any action pursued through the vehicle of § 1985(3). Although § 1985 is certainly a statute, it \"creates no rights,\" the <i>Novotny</i> Court observes, and is thus activated only \"when some otherwise defined federal right<i>to equal protection of the laws</i> or equal privileges and immunities under the lawsis breached by a conspiracy in the manner defined by the section.\" <i>Novotny, supra</i> at 376, 99 S.Ct. 2345. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p>Hence, § 1985 is a remedial vehicle to pursue the vindication of constitutionally guaranteed rights. The <i>Novotny</i> Court was unequivocal when it declared that a violation of rights contemplated under title VII could not be asserted through a § 1985(3) claim. <i>Id.</i> at 375-376, 99 S.Ct. 2345. It opined that pursuit of such a remedy would enable a complainant to \"avoid most if not all of [the] detailed and specific provisions of the law.\" <i>Id.</i> The majority is inaccurate in suggesting that using § 1985(3) to vindicate a violation of a constitutional right is substantively different than suing directly under the constitution.</p>\n<p>The majority uses its flawed analysis of <i>Novotny</i> as a springboard from which to leap to the general proposition that a legislative act can never \"trump\" the constitution. Nowhere in <i>Novotny</i> can one locate the principle that the majority attributes to it. Indeed, when the Supreme Court has addressed the subject of statutory preemption of constitutional remedies, it has reached the opposite conclusion.<sup>[20]</sup> It cannot be accurately said that <i>Novotny</i> lends credence to the conclusion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*891</span> that a constitutional claim can never be preempted by statute.</p>\n<p>The majority is unpersuasive in its attempt to distinguish <i>Smith v. Robinson</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court case that <i>directly</i> addresses the principle of statutory preemption of parallel constitutional claims.<sup>[21]</sup> As discussed above, the <i>Smith</i> Court held that a complainant's equal protection claim was preempted by a statute, the EA. The majority reads <i>Smith</i> to mean only that \"if a statutory remedy is available for an alleged constitutional violation, a party may be required to seek to remedy that alleged constitutional violation through the procedures provided by the statute.\" Op. at 18-19. It then finds that Miss Smith's claims were covered by the EHA. and that <i>Smith</i> is inapposite here.</p>\n<p>The flaw in its logic lies in its premise. In <i>Smith,</i> the principle claim involved the right of a handicapped child to a free public education. The claim that went to the United States Supreme Court was for attorney fees. Under the facts in <i>Smith,</i> the plaintiff was covered by the act and was unable to obtain attorney fees under an equal protection claim. Under the facts in <i>Sharp,</i> plaintiff was covered by the act and sought relief for various equal protection claims. Hence, in each case a statutory remedy was available to and sought by the plaintiff and the plaintiff sought relief, as well, for the same alleged wrongs through a direct constitutional due process claim. Consequently, <i>Smith</i> is <i>pertinent</i> and supports my conclusion that a comprehensive legislative scheme can preempt certain constitutional claims where the Legislature is authorized and intends to preempt an entire field of law.</p>\n<p>In attempting to distinguish the holding in <i>Smith</i> from the one I propose today, the majority points to a footnote in <i>Smith.</i> In it, the United States Supreme Court remarks that, if there were no statutory remedies for constitutional violations,</p>\n<blockquote>the power of federal courts to grant the relief necessary to protect against constitutional deprivations or to remedy the wrong done is presumed to be available in cases within their jurisdiction. [<i>Id.</i> at 1012, n. 15, 104 S.Ct. 3457 quoted <i>ante</i> at 882.]</blockquote>\n<p>This observation has no bearing on what the Court in <i>Smith</i> actually did decide: when the Legislature implements a comprehensive remedial scheme to rectify certain constitutional equal protection rights, the scheme will preempt parallel constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>The footnote is dictum because the <i>Smith</i> Court found that Congress <i>had</i> implemented such a comprehensive remedial scheme in the EA. Examined closely, the footnote stands only for the proposition that, absent a statutory scheme to remedy equal protection violations, courts can grant appropriate relief directly under the constitution.</p>\n<p>This goes precisely to my point. Indeed, if there were no title VII, or no EA, there certainly would exist a role for the courts in remedying the constitutional deprivations those statutes address. The courts, within jurisdictional limitations, would fill the void in legislation and right wrongs through claims brought directly under the constitution. Yet the fact that Congress <i>did</i> enact such legislation is thought to manifest dissatisfaction with existing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*892</span> remedies the courts were providing. It is said to evidence a desire, instead, to replace unsuccessful solutions with a comprehensive scheme that preempts the field, including the very preexistent constitutional claims that warranted the legislation. Hence, the holding of <i>Smith</i> is that the EA's legislative history leads to the conclusion that the act \"is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parent or guardian can pursue their claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1013, 104 S.Ct. 3457.</p>\n<p>Therefore, despite the majority's unsubstantiated assertion that a statute cannot \"trump\" the constitution, federal courts have long acknowledged the opposite principle.<sup>[22]</sup> Consistent with the logic working in <i>Smith,</i> these courts have applied <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny</i> to hold that title VII preempts constitutional equal protection claims that fall within the jurisdiction of the statute<sup>[23]</sup>. See, e.g., <i>Ethnic Employees of the Library of Congress v. Boorstin,</i> 243 U.S. App.D.C. 186, 196, 751 F.2d 1405 (1985) (observing that \"[a]llowing federal employees to recast their title VII claims as constitutional claims would clearly threaten those same policies\"); <i>Day v. Wayne Co. Bd. of Auditors,</i> 749 F.2d 1199, 1204-1205 (C.A.6, 1984); Kizas <i>v. Webster,</i> 227 U.S.App.D.C. 327, 345, 707 F.2d 524 (1983)(a Fifth Amendment claim based upon race and sex discrimination was barred by title VII); <i>Purtill v. Harris,</i> 658 F.2d 134, 137 (C.A.3, 1981) (relying on <i>Brown</i> to hold that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, modeled after title VII, preempts judicial remedies based directly on the constitution for claims of age discrimination in federal employment); <i>Lawrence v. Stats,</i> 214 U.S.App.D.C. 438, 439-441, 665 F.2d 1256 (1981) (a Fifth Amendment claim based on race discrimination would be barred if § 717 applied); <i>Davis v. Califano,</i> 198 U.S.App.D.C. 224, 225, n. 1, 613 F.2d 957 (1979); <i>Hofer v. Campbell,</i> 189 U.S.App.D.C. 197, 200, 581 F.2d 975 (1978) (a Fifth Amendment claim based on national origin discrimination was barred by title VII); <i>Richardson v. Wiley,</i> 186 U.S.App.D.C. 309, 310, 569 F.2d 140 (1977); <i>Gissen v. Tackman,</i> 537 F.2d 784, 786 (C.A.3, 1976); <i>Lutes v. Goldin,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d 118 (D.D.C., 1999); <i>Brug v. Nat'l Coalition for the Homeless,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d 33, 42 (D.D.C., 1999); <i>Clement v. Motta, </i> 820 F.Supp. 1035 (W.D.Mich., 1991).</p>\n<p>In <i>Kizas,</i> the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected a reverse discrimination claim brought by white clerical and support employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The complainants alleged that including affirmative action principles in the qualifying process for special agents violated their Fifth Amendment constitutional right to equal protection as well as their <span class=\"star-pagination\">*893</span> statutory title VII rights. The court concluded that the plaintiffs' constitutional claim was \"unavoidably foreclosed by [the] precedent\" of <i>Brown. Kizas,</i> at 345, 707 F.2d 524. Their sole remedy was under title VII. The <i>Kizas</i> Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote>The Kizas complainants suggest, in repeated but less than lucid argument, that the Constitution's equal protection principle entails a stricter restraint on classification by race or sex than does Title VII and would shelter them against \"reverse\" discrimination that the statute may permit. We need not linger over this suggestion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>They may not circumvent the \"careful and thorough remedial scheme\" Congress ordered for them; their access to court is determined by that effective, albeit demanding statute. [<i>Kizas,</i> at 345-346, 707 F.2d 524.]</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. THE CRA</h2>\n<p>In the instant case, Sharp is covered by the protections afforded through the CRAa legislative enactment every bit as detailed and comprehensive as its federal counterpart, title VII.</p>\n<p>Section 717 contains a general prohibition of federal employment \"discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" § 717(a). Michigan's CRA contains a proscription at M.C.L. § 37.2202(1), which provides in part:</p>\n<p>An employer shall not ...:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) Fail or refuse to hire, or recruit, or discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 717 also provides the Civil Service Commission with the power and authority to enforce the civil rights requirements of title VII. Michigan vests its own Civil Rights Commission with similar enforcement powers. Article 6 of the CRA delegates powers and duties to the commission, M.C.L. § 37.2601, and the Civil Rights Department, M.C.L. § 37.2602. Section 602(c) establishes in the Department the authority to</p>\n<blockquote>[r]eceive, initiate, investigate, conciliate, adjust, dispose of, issue charges, and hold hearings on complaints alleging a violation of this act, and approve or disapprove plans to correct past discriminatory practices which have caused or resulted in a denial of equal opportunity with respect to groups or persons protected by this act.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, § 717(c) outlines a detailed administrative grievance procedure that a complainant must follow before filing suit in federal district court. It gives an aggrieved federal employee thirty days from a final order of the Civil Service Commission to register an appeal in a district court.</p>\n<p>Michigan's CRA provides an almost identical structure. See M.C.L. § 37.2605-37.2606. Section 605 requires the state commission to issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law to support a conclusion that an employer has engaged in discriminatory practices. The section also details the various remedies available to the commission following a finding of discrimination in violation of the CRA. Finally, § 606 provides the complainant with the right to appeal from any final decision of the commission to a circuit court within thirty days.</p>\n<p>The parallels that exist between title VII and the CRA are undeniable. Similarly, the concerns apparent in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny</i> about parallel claims that threaten to dilute the comprehensive scheme carefully crafted by Congress also exist here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*894</span> Michigan's CRA provides the kind of detailed scheme that the United States Supreme Court recognizes as providing the sole remedy for claims arising under its coverage umbrella.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. LEGISLATIVE INTENT</h2>\n<p>Moreover, the language of the act, case law, and the legislative record persuasively support the proposition that our Legislature intended the CRA be the sole remedy for state employment discrimination claims in Michigan. The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <i>Frankenmuth Mut. Ins. v. Marlette Homes, Inc.,</i> 456 Mich. 511, 515, 573 N.W.2d 611 (1998). Like title VII, the CRA does not contain an express description of its position in the constellation of antidiscrimination law. Thus, it is appropriate to look for legislative intent in other, less obvious places. <i>Brown, supra</i> at 825, 96 S.Ct. 1961. \"Where the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes everything from which aid can be derived....\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 386, 2 L.Ed. 304 (1805).</p>\n<p>To begin, the language of the CRA itself manifests an apparent intent to establish a broad, comprehensive scheme that \"defines\" and remedies violations of civil rights. The preamble to the CRA begins: \"An act to <i>define civil rights....\"</i> 1976 PA 453 (emphasis added). It continues by describing its own purpose as \"to prohibit discriminatory practices\" and \"to provide remedies and penalties....\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, on its face, the CRA shows that the Legislature envisioned it as comprehensive and detailed.</p>\n<p>The legislative history, as gathered from House and Senate bill analyses generated before the act's passage in 1976, bears out this suggestion. The legislative documents explain that the act was intended to address the problems caused by the splintered remedial systems that existed before 1976 in the area of civil rights. The report accompanying House Bill 4055 described the bill as a consolidation of these concepts into a single law that would</p>\n<blockquote>place legal and procedural recourse for <i>all civil rights discrimination</i> within the Department of Civil Rights, enabling the Department to provide more effective remedies for those who have been victimized by unlawful discrimination. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p>The bill analysis further describes the bill as a means of \"[outlining] more specifically the <i>legal action a person could take</i> if that person feels that he or she has been unfairly discriminated against.\" (Emphasis added.) The \"Argument For:\" section of the bill analysis includes the following two statements of purpose, both bearing particular relevance to this case:</p>\n<blockquote>The bill would provide a <i>uniform statutory framework</i> to deal with the many different forms of discrimination. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>The bill would include the concept of discrimination enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to equal protection under the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, the CRA, like its federal counterpart, was intended as a vehicle to define and consolidate the various remedial measures accorded by other statutes. Moreover, it was envisioned as incorporating the \"concept of discrimination\" inherent in the Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*895</span> Courts have interpreted the CRA as bearing a singular objective in harmony with the Michigan Constitution and as an instrument to interpret and enforce its provisions. See, e.g., <i>Thompson v. Bd. of Ed. Romeo Comm. Schs,</i> 519 F.Supp. 1373, 1380 (W.D.Mich., 1981) (interpreting Michigan law to conclude that the \"general object [of the CRA] is to define and protect certain civil rights of individuals under the jurisdiction of Michigan law\"); <i>Neal v. Dep't of Corrections,</i> 232 Mich.App. 730, 734, 592 N.W.2d 370 (1998)(\"[t]he act is remedial and must be liberally construed to effectuate its ends\").</p>\n<p>I find that the intent that appears to underlie the CRA supports the proposition that the Legislature meant it to provide the sole remedy for public employment discrimination claims in Michigan. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court's decisive interpretation in <i>Brown, Novotny,</i> and their progeny of the breadth of § 717 of title VII renders convincing guidance in determining the breadth of Michigan's CRA. Just as title VII provides the sole remedy for equal protection claims involving federal governmental employment discrimination, the CRA provides the sole remedy for Michigan governmental employment discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. ANALOGY</h2>\n<p>A Michigan complainant like Mr. Sharp is in the same position as the complainants in <i>Kizas.</i> He may not circumvent the \"careful and thorough remedial scheme\" that the Legislature, in response to the direct call of the people, has ordered for him. <i>Kizas,</i> at 346, 707 F.2d 524. His access to court \"is determined by that effective, albeit demanding, statute.\" <i>Id.</i> He may not pursue a state constitutional equal protection claim that falls within the purview of the CRA.<sup>[25]</sup> Allowing that a parallel and circuitous claim would dilute the CRA's purpose, just as allowing Novotny to seek constitutional redress would have diluted the carefully crafted scheme of title VII.</p>\n<p>In addition to the persuasiveness of federal analogous law is the sheer counter intuitiveness of allowing an equal protection claim to survive in this case. If a complainant were entitled to relief under the state Equal Protection Clause as an alternative to the CRA, the safe harbor provision would be dramatically weakened. If the safe harbor were destroyed, the CRA would fail in one of its essential <span class=\"star-pagination\">*896</span> purposes: to provide for affirmative action in order to alleviate past instances of discrimination.</p>\n<p>In turn, the delegates to the 1961 Constitutional Convention would have failed in their attempt to draft art. 1, § 2 as a set of policy goals \"pointing the way\" for the Legislature. Such a result is inconsistent with the expressed policy goals of the constitutional framers and the intent of the Legislature in enacting the CRA. In addition, it ignores the persuasive direction charted by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Brown,</i><sup>[26]</sup><i>Novotny,</i> and their respective progeny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. SHARP'S INADEQUATELY PLEADED CASE</h2>\n<p>A more detailed analysis of whether plaintiff has pleaded and preserved any other direct constitutional claim is appropriate here.</p>\n<blockquote>MCR 2.111 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) Statement of Claim. A complaint, counter-claim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint must contain the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) A statement of the facts, without repetition, on which the pleader relies in stating the cause of action, with the specific allegations necessary reasonably to inform the adverse party of the nature of the claims the adverse party is called on to defend[.]</blockquote>\n<p>In his second amended complaint, plaintiff pleaded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>7. Notwithstanding rejection of Plaintiff's application for employment as a fire fighter in the Lansing fire department, Defendant city of Lansing and the Lansing fire department have continued to accept applications for employment and have continued to hire persons as fire fighters who are not certified fire fighters and not as well qualified as Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>10. Defendant city of Lansing and its fire department have limited, segregated or classified plaintiff in a way that tends to deprive him of employment opportunities in the public fire department of the city of Lansing, or otherwise adversely affects his status as an applicant because of his race and sex.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>13. Defendant city of Lansing has adopted a policy of discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex and national origin by means of treating white male applicants for employment less favorably than applicants who are not white males.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>14. Defendant city of Lansing has applied its policy of discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex and national origin to the Lansing fire department.</blockquote>\n<p>15. Defendant city of Lansing and its fire department have manipulated facially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*897</span> neutral testing procedures to discriminate on the basis of race, sex and national origin by means of giving second, third and fourth chances to members of favored races, sex or national origin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>18. Defendant city of Lansing obtained approval for a voluntary affirmative action plan in 1987 but has abandoned the approved plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>19. Defendant's affirmative action plan lacks any rational connection with a legitimate governmental objective for the reason that ten years of enforcement of the said voluntary affirmative action plan has had no effect on the distribution of women and minorities in the non-supervisory ranks of the Lansing fire department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>20. Defendant city of Lansing adopted both its <i>approved</i> voluntary affirmative action plan, and its <i>unapproved</i> voluntary affirmative action plan with intent to discriminate on the basis of race and sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>21. The only effect of ten years of voluntary affirmative action in the Lansing fire department has been to deprive white males of employment opportunities in the Lansing fire department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>22. Plaintiff has sustained damages in the premises in excess of $10,000.00, in violation of the form of the Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act and Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Wherefore, Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court enter its order enjoining Defendant city of Lansing from discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex or national origin....</blockquote>\n<p>Plaintiff's pleadings acknowledge the apparent constitutionality of an affirmative action plan that has been approved by the commission and enacted in conformity with § 210. There is no dispute that the city's plan satisfies both criteria. In his answer to defendant's affirmative defenses, plaintiff stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Plaintiff affirmatively avers that an affirmative action plan may be adopted and carried out <i>\"if</i> the plan is filed with the commission under rules of the commission and the commission approves the plan.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As the majority concedes, plaintiff is barred from pursuing a claim under the CRA. By extension, then, he has failed to state a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution. Simply stated, he has nothing left to pursue on remand.</p>\n<p>The majority misrepresents my position as asserting that the <i>only way</i> to challenge a state actor's implementation of a law is to challenge the law itself. It interprets this dissent as in conflict with <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986),<sup>[27]</sup> and <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> 118 U.S. 356, 6 S.Ct. 1064, 30 L.Ed. 220 (1886).<sup>[28]</sup> In so doing, it overlooks a crucial fact that distinguishes <i>Batson</i> and <i>Yick Wo</i> from the instant case: the relationship of the underlying \"law\" to the conduct alleged in this case is distinguishable from the relationship of those two variables as they operated in <i>Batson</i> and <i>Yick Wo.</i> The key difference is that § 210 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*898</span> <i>expressly allows</i> the conduct in which defendant engaged. It permits racial discrimination within certain parameters. The city of Lansing governed itself within those constitutional parameters. Though he tried, Mr. Sharp could not establish a factual issue to the contrary .</p>\n<p>By contrast, the underlying law in <i>Batson</i> did not expressly allow the conduct in which the Kentucky prosecutor engaged. The \"law\" in <i>Batson</i> did not permit prosecutors to exercise peremptory challenges on the basis of race. It did not even address race. Thus, the unconstitutional implementation at work in <i>Batson</i> was found in the \"deviation\" from what the underlying constitutional law would allow. That \"law\" had been applied to Batson in a way that denied him equal treatment under it. I apply the same standard to Mr. Sharp's claim, but reach a different result because the law in his case operated exactly as legislators intended it should.<sup>[29]</sup> There was no deviation from the scheme intended by the Michigan Legislature.</p>\n<p>However, despite Mr. Sharp's failure to articulate a cognizable claim, another in his position would not necessarily be without a remedy. A complainant could challenge the constitutionality of the CRA generally, or of the safe harbor, testing whether either constitutes a constitutional implementation of art. 1, § 2. Sharp chose not to do so. Alternatively, a complainant could challenge the commission's approval of an affirmative action plan, arguing that the plan fails to conform to criteria required by the CRA for approval.<sup>[30]</sup> Again, Sharp chose not to pursue such a claim.</p>\n<p>Finally, a complainant could articulate a challenge to a public employer's actions in implementing a plan, by demonstrating that they fell outside the scope authorized by § 210. He could establish a fact question on such a claim by showing, hypothetically, that the employer hired a minority firefighter despite the fact that the individual had failed a required physical examination. Hiring such a candidate, who would not be qualified even with the benefit of the affirmative action plan, would not fall within the protection of the safe harbor. A complainant could establish a fact question whether the employer used some other <i>unapproved</i> plan, thereby violating complainant's rights. Such acts would not be protected by the safe harbor and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> complainant's art. 1, § 2 rights could be vindicated under the CRA.</p>\n<p>Sharp attempted to create a fact question under certain of these theories, but failed. Hence, he is now left with nothing by way of an action arising either under the CRA or directly under art. 1, § 2. With no cognizable claims remaining that have not already been discharged, his In cause was properly dismissed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>I agree with the majority that the safe harbor protects the city of Lansing from an action against it under the CRA. I further acknowledge that the Legislature cannot abrogate constitutional rights through passage of a statute. However, the constitution can delegate authority. The CRA is the Legislature's response to one such constitutional delegation of authority. I believe that art. 1, § 2, envisioned that the Legislature would pass an act like the CRA that could be the exclusive remedy for vindicating civil rights claims against public employers in Michigan. I base this conclusion on the expressed intent of certain constitutional convention delegates and by analogy to a persuasive line of federal authority regarding title VII and the Federal Equal Protection Clause. The CRA closely resembles title VII that the United States Supreme Court in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny</i> held preempted the field of employment discrimination claims under federal law. Allowing the pursuit of parallel constitutional claims to remedy wrongs cognizable under the CRA is not only illogical, it threatens to undermine and destroy the comprehensive design of the statute. Such a contrary ruling could not reflect the intent of either the Legislature in passing the act or the people in adopting the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p>The majority first misconstrues my position, then finds it \"a startling proposition.\" Op at 18. It states my position as being that, if a state actor commits ongoing employment discrimination violative of the state Equal Protection Clause but not violative of the CRA, the courts cannot end the discrimination. My position is that, if a state actor commits employment discrimination by performing acts covered by the CRA, the state Equal Protection Clause cannot be used to end the discrimination.</p>\n<p>I have demonstrated that this proposition has extensive support in holdings of the United States Supreme Court. Moreover, a contrary holding, the majority's holding, sadly weakens the \"noble contributions of the state and federal courts\" in fighting discrimination that it purports to esteem.</p>\n<p>The majority states that my reading of the law allows the Legislature to \"trump\" the Michigan constitution. It says that \"it is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot grant a license to state and local governmental actors to violate the Michigan Constitution.\" Op. at 21. However, a close examination reveals that this is mere rhetoric and misses the mark.</p>\n<p>Without dispute, the constitution can delegate to the Legislature the task of devising a comprehensive statutory scheme to protect specific constitutional rights. Art. 1, § 2 contains such a constitutional provision, and it is the one involved in this case. It is also beyond dispute that, when one person's constitutional rights conflict with another's, courts will render a decision whereby one right is sublimated to the other.</p>\n<p>This dissent, simply stated, stands for the proposition that, when a state actor discriminates against a person in a manner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*900</span> made lawful by the CRA, that person's art. 1, § 2 rights are sublimated to the art. 1, § 2 constitutional rights of others to have the state actor discriminate in their interest. Art. 1, § 2 delegated to the Legislature the power to implement it. In turn, the Legislature authorized the sublimation of one person's equal protection rights over another's when it created § 210.</p>\n<p>The majority also distorts the meaning of the dissent when it asserts that I would prevent the Court from hearing plaintiff'sclaim that defendant discriminated against him. It states that the dissent would prevent plaintiff from recovering for defendant's acts that, although not violative of the CRA, violate the Due Process Clause. However, one should note, it neglects to specify the acts. What conduct by defendant does plaintiff claim violated art. 1, § 2, but did not violate the CRA? In fact, plaintiff has named no governmental action by defendant that survived summary disposition, or that should have, and, that, also, violated the Due Process Clause .</p>\n<p>Here, Sharp cannot sue under the CRA because of the bar imposed by § 210. Both the nature of his claim and his pleadings preclude the availability to him of a parallel constitutional claim. The CRA provides his exclusive remedy. Because the Court of Appeals properly dismissed this action, I would affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  MCL 37.2101 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.</p>\n<p>[3]  It reversed in part, allowing plaintiff to amend his complaint to claim discrimination based on residency. This aspect of the ruling is not in dispute.</p>\n<p>[4]  The details of the plan itself are not central to the questions presented in this case. The stated goal of the plan was to increase the percentage of minorities and women in the fire department, which was composed predominantly of white males. In the interest of achieving its goal, the city made race and gender factors in hiring decisions.</p>\n<p>[5]  236 Mich.App. 452, 600 N.W.2d 421 (1999). <i>Cole</i> provided that an employer is insulated from liability under the CRA whenever it is insulated under title VII, its federal counterpart.</p>\n<p>[6]  The per curiam opinion was signed by Court of Appeals Judges Michael J.

[MCL 37.2202.]</p>\n<p>[8]  Section 801(1) provides: \"A person alleging a violation of this act may bring a civil action for appropriate injunctive relief or damages, or both.\" [MCL 37.2801.]</p>\n<p>[9]  However, money damages are not available to an aggrieved plaintiff under these circumstances. See <i>Lewis v. Michigan,</i> 464 Mich. 781, 629 N.W.2d 868 (2001).</p>\n<p>[10]  In his first amended complaint, plaintiff prayed that the Ingham Circuit Court enter an order \"enjoining Defendant city of Lansing from discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex or national origin....\"</p>\n<p>[11]  Defendant characterizes plaintiff's claim as an effort to \"vindicate equal protection rights through the vehicle of [the CRA] .\" Thus, according to defendant, there is no stand-alone claim for constitutional relief.</p>\n<p>[12]  For this reason, we hold today in <i>Lewis, supra,</i> that we do not have authority to grant money damages or other compensatory relief for past violations of art. 1, § 2.</p>\n<p>[13]  Of course, the type of relief that is directly available for a violation of art. 1, § 2 is different from the action for money damages against the federal government available under <i>Davis.</i> As we have discussed above, this Court's holding today in <i>Lewis, supra,</i> makes clear that there is no cause of action for money damages arising directly under art. 1, § 2. Rather, a plaintiff may seek injunctive or declaratory relief against the alleged constitutional violation</p>\n<p>[14]  The dissent misapprehends our consideration of <i>Bolling</i> in stating that our use of that case \"to predict the effects of a legislative act in 1972 evidences a remarkable twist of the laws of time and space.\" <i>Post</i> at 895, n. 25. We do not in any way rely on <i>Bolling</i> as indicating the intent of Congress in making any amendments to title VII in 1972. Rather, we rely on <i>Bolling</i> as indicating that a court may directly grant injunctive relief against a constitutional violation without regard to the content of any statute.</p>\n<p>[15]  Consistent with our holding today in <i>Lewis, supra,</i> we reiterate that judicial authority under the state Equal Protection Clause is limited to providing injunctive or declaratory relief to nullify unconstitutional legislation or otherwise stop a recurring violation of the state Equal Protection Clause. As discussed in <i>Lewis,</i> because of the language of the state Equal Protection Clause, any provision for compensatory relief or similar measures to positively <i>implement</i> the clause requires legislative action.</p>\n<p>[16]  We note that the present case does not involve a challenge to the constitutionality of § 210.</p>\n<p>[1]  In observing that \"a complainant could challenge the commission's approval of an affirmative action plan, arguing that the plan fails to conform to criteria required by the CRA for approval,\" <i>post</i> at 898, the dissent apparently does not disagree with this proposition. However, the dissent asserts that my \"sweeping interpretation, if accurate, would render the safe-harbor provision unworkable.\" <i>Post</i> at 898, n. 30. I have difficulty understanding why my view is a \"sweeping interpretation,\" when I am merely quoting <i>verbatim</i> the statutory language, i.e., \"[a] person subject to this article may adopt and carry out a plan to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity ...\" M.C.L. § 37.2210. I agree with the dissent that the \"safe harbor does not protect only those plans that <i>succeed</i> in eliminating present effects of past discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Rather, the safe harbor protects all properly approved plans that are \"adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity ...\"<i>but only such plans.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The significance of this unremarkable observationthat the language of § 210 means what it saysarises largely in the event that the constitutionality of § 210 is ultimately sustained, in particular, if predicated upon the premise that what would otherwise be unconstitutional, i.e., a hiring plan allowing the government-as-employer to treat persons differently on account of religion, race, color, or national origin, is made constitutional by virtue of the standards set forth for affording an affirmative action plan a \"safe harbor.\" See <i>City of Borne v. Flores,</i> 521 U.S. 507, 519, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997)(\"Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right is.

Nevertheless, the reasoning of <i>Smith</i> still stands for the proposition that a comprehensive remedial scheme <i>will</i> preclude parallel constitutional claims. See <i>Zombro v.

This is accurate. However, in analogizing the specific facts of <i>Davis</i> to this case, the majority overlooks the distinction that the claim at issue in <i>Davis</i> did not fall under the umbrella of title VII. The plaintiff there, by virtue of her status as a congressional employee, was not eligible for coverage under title VII. Thus, her ability to pursue a constitutional remedy would not undercut title VII's remedial scheme. Indeed, the <i>Davis</i> Court reaffirmed <i>Brown's</i> exclusivity principle.\n</p>\n<p>By contrast, this case involves an individual, Mr. Sharp, who is protected by the applicable legislation, the CRA. He is not barred by having a status that renders him outside the scope of its contemplation. His inability to state a successful claim under the CRA does not place him in the same position as the plaintiff in <i>Davis.</i> Factually speaking, he more closely resembles the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny,</i> where the Supreme Court restricted access to alternative parallel remedies. <i>Davis, supra</i> at 247, n. 26, 99 S.Ct. 2264.</p>\n<p>[19]  Op. at 13.</p>\n<p>[20]  See <i>Smith v. Robinson</i><i>,</i> n. 6 <i>supra,</i> which lists federal cases that apply <i>Smith</i> in finding a statutory preemption of constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>[21]  The majority chooses not to \"burden readers of this opinion with a further discussion of case law from the lower federal courts,\" op. at 17, but opts to ignore the considerable line of federal cases that have applied <i>Smith</i> to find statutory preemption of constitutional claims. See n. 6.</p>\n<p>[22]  As stated in n. 6, numerous federal cases have cited <i>Smith</i> as authority for making the type of ruling that the majority claims cannot be made.</p>\n<p>[23]  Some federal circuits have held that title VII does not necessarily provide the only remedy available for employment discrimination claims. See, e.g., <i>Beardsley v. Webb,</i> 30 F.3d 524, 527 (C.A.4, 1994). However, many of these decisions dealt with claims arising from facts beyond the contemplation of title VII, such that recognizing them would not encroach upon the area defined by title VII.\n</p>\n<p>Even those circuits that have interpreted <i>Brown</i> narrowly have not, as the majority suggests, done so on the basis of any distinction between legal and equitable remedies. See, e.g., <i>Annis v. Westchester County,</i> 36 F.3d 251 (C.A.2, 1994); <i>Notari v. Denver Water Dep't,</i> 971 F.2d 585 (C.A.10, 1992). Instead, most have so held on the basis that they disagree about the scope of coverage that Congress intended. The majority offers no case holding that it is beyond the inherent power of any legislative body to enact a statutory scheme that preempts parallel constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>[24]  The Equal Protection Clause of Michigan's Constitution is virtually identical to its counterpart contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They are interpreted as embodiments of the same concepts. See, e.g., <i>Moore v. Spangler,</i> 401 Mich. 360, 370, 258 N.W.2d 34 (1977); <i>Naudzius v. Lahr,</i> 253 Mich. 216, 222, 234 N.W. 581 (1931).</p>\n<p>[25]  The majority intimates that <i>Lewis v. Michigan,</i> 464 Mich. 781, 629 N.W.2d 868 (2001); issued with this decision, holds that a complainant has a direct claim under the constitution for equitable relief from an approved affirmative action plan. Op. at 15, n. 13. The issue in <i>Lewis</i> is whether this Court should recognize the existence of a claim for monetary damages directly under the Equal Protection Clause. It does not address whether a party can seek equitable relief under the auspices of the constitution.\n</p>\n<p>The majority miscasts my position in this dissent as one that leaves certain Michigan citizens entirely without civil rights or constitutional protections. Also, it cites <i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954) as assuming that Congress would amend title VII eighteen years later to retain the availability of equitable relief directly under the constitution. The use of a 1954 Supreme Court case to predict the effects of a legislative act in 1972 evidences a remarkable twist of the laws of time and space. Moreover, <i>Bolling</i> is inapposite because it describes federal employment discrimination remedies that existed before 1972. The 1972 amendments of title VII were aimed at altering the legal foundation for pursuing federal employment discrimination claims in the public sector. <i>Brown, Novotny, Smith,</i> and each case upon which I rely, concern the state of employment discrimination law <i>after</i> 1972.</p>\n<p>[26]  To counter the unqualified, direct holding of <i>Brown,</i> the majority relies on a misreading of it. <i>Brown</i> does not state that the 1972 amendments to title VII left intact the availability of injunctive relief for federal employment discrimination directly under the Fifth Amendment. There is little question that the <i>Brown</i> Court regarded earlier remedies for employment discrimination in the public sector as impotent. See <i>Brown, supra</i> at 826, 96 S.Ct. 1961 (\"If administrative remedies were ineffective, judicial relief from federal employment discrimination was even more problematic before 1972.\") Injunctive relief, like the balance of remedies available before 1972, effected nothing to merit celebration among opponents of workplace discrimination.\n</p>\n<p>According to the <i>Brown</i> Court, that was the weakness that Congress intended to address through the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. Its aim was to preempt the field by providing a comprehensive, exclusive slate of remedies, displacing existing legal <i>and equitable</i> claims. I find that our Legislature intended the CRA to have similar preemptive force.</p>\n<p>[27]  Batson held that the federal Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from using peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors because of race.</p>\n<p>[28]  The <i>Yick Wo</i> Court found an equal protection violation where an otherwise neutral San Francisco city ordinance was applied unequally to citizens on the basis of race.</p>\n<p>[29]  Similarly, in <i>Yick Wo,</i> the law at issue did not expressly authorize discrimination on the basis of race. It established an approval process for operating certain types of laundry businesses in San Francisco. The process was used to deny business opportunities to Chinese immigrants, while granting them to non-Chinese applicants. The \"law\" in <i>Yick Wo</i> did not authorize city officials to treat Chinese applicants differently than others. Rather, it established a neutral permitting process. City officials applied that law unequally, thereby violating the equal protection guarantee of the constitution. Such a fact pattern is easily distinguishable from the instant case, where an admittedly constitutional statute prescribes the very discrimination from which plaintiff claims to have suffered.</p>\n<p>[30]  The concurrence is mistaken in its suggestion that I agree that the \"safe harbor encompasses only affirmative action plans that are `adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out ... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity....'\" op. at 2. The safe harbor does not protect only those plans that succeed in eliminating present effects of past discrimination. Section 210 contemplates protection for any properly approved plan that is reasonably created with the intention of eliminating discrimination or furthering equal opportunities in the workplace. The section specifically refers to plans \"to\" eliminate effects of discrimination, not plans \"that\" do in fact eliminate them. The concurrence's sweeping interpretation, if accurate, would render the safe-harbor provision unworkable.</p>\n\n</div>",

Plaintiff alleged violations of the Michigan Civil Rights Act (CRA)<sup>[1]</sup> and the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution<sup>[2]</sup>. The trial court granted summary disposition for the city, finding plaintiff's claims barred by the \"safe harbor\" provision of M.C.L. § 37.2210. The Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal.<sup>[3]</sup> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.

Principally at issue is whether the safe harbor provision also shields such an employer from constitutional equal protection challenges. We hold that it does not. We affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals, reverse it in part, and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>Plaintiff wanted to be a firefighter with the city of Lansing Fire Department. He believed himself qualified, since he was a certified firefighter and the fire chief in Onondaga Township. For six consecutive years, 1990-1995, he applied for a firefighter position with the city. Each time he was denied employment. He believes that the city wrongfully refused to hire him because he is a Caucasian male.</p>\n<p>The reason for the repeated rejection, according to Sharp, was the city's affirmative action plan.<sup>[4]</sup> The plan was formally approved by the Civil Rights Commission in April 1987, pursuant to § 210 of the CRA. That provision generally encourages employers to implement voluntary affirmative action plans and sets forth a procedure for doing so.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff sued the city, seeking damages, an injunction barring further use of the affirmative action plan, and a position with the city fire department. He argued that § 210 did not bar his claim and that the city's plan operated unconstitutionally with respect to him. Defendant disagreed and moved for summary disposition on the ground that the safe harbor of § 210 precluded all liability. The trial court granted the motion before the close of discovery, relying on MCR 2.116(C)(8), (10). It concluded that the CRA provided the exclusive remedy for discrimination claims in the state and, therefore, such a claim was barred in this instance.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's grant of summary disposition, relying on <i>Cole v. General Motors Corp.</i><sup>[5]</sup> The panel believed that it was bound by the precedent of <i>Cole;</i> but disagreed with the reasoning employed there. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Because plaintiff does not challenge the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act itself, but only the validity of defendant's affirmative action plan and the</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*876</span> actions of defendant employer, we believe that the ruling in <i>Cole</i> effectively resolves plaintiff's claim in this case. Were it not for the <i>Cole</i> decision, however, we would reach a different result. [238 Mich.App. at 519, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span>.]</blockquote>\n<p>If working from \"a clean slate,\" the Court of Appeals majority<sup>[6]</sup> added, it would not interpret § 210 as providing defendant employer with a shield from liability. Instead, it would have subjected the plan itself to constitutional review and would have held that § 210 does not \"automatically\" confer immunity from statutory liability under the CRA. We granted plaintiff's application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff argues that the city's affirmative action plan should not have been approved. He asserts that the plan delegates too much authority to the city by allowing the city to make changes to it without commission approval. He contends, also, that the trial court erred by granting summary disposition before discovery ended. A genuine issue of fact exists, he argues, about whether the plan ever received approval from the commission. Finally, he challenges the lower court's decision that § 210 completely immunizes defendant's actions taken in accordance with its approved affirmative action plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>This case involves the interplay of the Equal Protection Clause of our constitution and the statutory framework of the CRA. Art 1, § 2 guarantees Michigan citizens the right to be free from racial discrimination in employment by state actors. That clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote>No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color or national origin. The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.</blockquote>\n<p>The CRA extended these protections to employment in the private sector. Thus, it prohibits racial employment discrimination by private and government employers<sup>[7]</sup>, while creating a damages remedy<sup>[8]</sup> for those victimized by unlawful employment acts.</p>\n<p>Section 210 of the CRA invites employers to implement their own affirmative action policies. Under this section, an employer's actions that would otherwise violate the CRA are permissible, provided they are taken pursuant to an affirmative action plan properly approved by the commission. Section 210 provides:</p>\n<p>A person subject to this article may adopt and carry out a plan to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity with respect to religion, race, color, national origin, or sex if the plan is filed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*877</span> with the commission under rules of the commission and the commission approves the plan.</p>\n<p>We presume that the Legislature intended the unequivocal meaning expressed in § 210. See <i>Nation v. W.D.E. Electric Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877353/nation-v-wde-elec-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span>, 494, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1877353\"><a href=\"/opinion/1877353/nation-v-wde-elec-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span> (1997). It provides a safe harbor for public and private employers who act in accordance with properly approved affirmative action plans. However, the safe harbor does not shield against all claims. It merely protects employers from liability under the CRA for doing precisely what the statute itself invites them to do.</p>\n<p>In support of its motion for summary disposition, defendant presented affidavits showing that its hiring decisions had been made pursuant to an affirmative action plan approved by the Civil Rights Commission in 1987. Plaintiff does not dispute that the commission approved defendant's 1987 plan. Rather, he argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists whether defendant actually used the approved plan in making hiring decisions between 1990 and 1995. Plaintiff contends that defendant followed different and <i>unapproved</i> plans when making the hiring decisions at issue. Moreover, he asserts, the commission \"exceeded its authority\" by giving to defendant the discretion periodically to adjust its hiring goals without commission approval.</p>\n<p>The essence of plaintiff's position is that defendant's periodic revision of its hiring goals after 1987 resulted in the establishment of new affirmative action plans. He argues that these plans should have been submitted for commission approval. However, plaintiff has offered no factual support for his assertions. Accordingly, he has failed to create a genuine issue of material fact whether defendant relied on a series of separate, unapproved plans in making the hiring decisions at issue. Moreover, he has not established that further discovery would uncover support for that assertion. Therefore, we reject his argument that summary disposition entered prematurely with respect to the CRA claim.</p>\n<p>In a related vein, plaintiff suggests that the commission erred in failing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law when it approved defendant's affirmative action plan. Plaintiff did preserve the issue whether the commission was required under the Administrative Procedures Act, M.C.L. § 24.285, to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. However, for the reasons set forth in the Court of Appeals decision, M.C.L. § 24.285 is not applicable to this case. 238 Mich.App. at 521, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span>. Accordingly, plaintiff has <i>not</i> preserved the issue whether the commission was required under § 210 to make findings of fact and conclusions of law. Thus, we conclude that the safe-harbor provision bars plaintiff's statutory claims against the city.</p>\n<p>But our inquiry does not end there. A state actor is involved. Consequently, the protections provided directly by the state Equal Protection Clause come into play. When an aggrieved plaintiff alleges that a public employer denied his equal protection rights in violation of art. 1, § 2, the employer's acts are subject to review under that constitutional provision. Injunctive and declaratory relief are available to restrain any acts found to violate the state Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[9]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*878</span> Hence, the mere existence of an approved affirmative action plan does not insulate a state employer, or its plan, from all judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p>In this case, plaintiff sought constitutional relief, alleging that defendant's affirmative action plan violates art. 1, § 2.<sup>[10]</sup> Defendant asserts that plaintiff did not vigorously pursue his constitutional theory either at trial or in the Court of Appeals. It argues that such a lack of pursuit constitutes an abandonment of the claim, regardless of how it was pleaded.<sup>[11]</sup> We disagree that plaintiff failed to pursue his constitutional claim sufficiently.</p>\n<p>Although plaintiff's presentation of this issue was somewhat scattered, the record reveals that plaintiff <i>did</i> raise the issue at various stages of the litigation. First, he challenged the constitutionality of defendant's plan in his own motion for partial summary disposition, which was denied. Next, he raised the issue in his motion for reconsideration of the trial court's decision granting summary disposition to defendant. Finally, he raised it in the Court of Appeals. Indeed, the Court of Appeals itself acknowledged the issue. The problem with the analyses of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals is that the lower courts apparently assumed that § 210 alone resolved plaintiff's constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p>Hence, we find that plaintiff pleaded and pursued his constitutional theory sufficiently to provide notice to defendant of the claims against which it would have to defend. Having preserved the issue, plaintiff is entitled to be heard on his claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p>The dissent's conclusion that plaintiff's constitutional challenge is barred fails to appreciate that the safe harbor provided by § 210 necessarily extends only to <i>statutory</i> claims under the CRA. There is simply no requirement that a plaintiff proceed through a statutory vehicle in order to seek declaratory or injunctive relief against an alleged violation of the state Equal Protection Clause. While the second sentence of art 1, § 2 commits its affirmative \"implementation\" to the Legislature,<sup>[12]</sup> the first sentence of this constitutional provision commands that \"[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws; nor shall any person be denied the enjoyment of his civil or political rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of religion, race, color, or national origin.\" The duty imposed on the Legislature by the second sentence of art 1, § 2 to <i>implement</i> art. 1, § 2 is not a power to ultimately <i>define</i> the substantive meaning of the first sentence. Accordingly, while the state judiciary cannot positively implement art. 1, § 2, the judiciary has the legitimate authority, in the exercise of the well-established duty of judicial review, to evaluate governmental action to determine if it is consistent with the equal protection guarantees of the first sentence of art. 1, § 2 and to invalidate such action if it is not. In short, art. 1, § 2 commands the Legislature to adopt measures to practically implement its equal protection guarantees. This \"implementation\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*879</span> language does not mean that state and local governmental entities are free to violate the substantive equal protection guarantees of art. 1, § 2 merely because the Legislature has failed to address a particular type of violation.</p>\n<p>Our dissenting colleague relies heavily on an analogy to federal law, particularly United States Supreme Court decisions related to employment discrimination claims against the federal government. The dissent portrays this case law as indicating that title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act (\"title VII\") provides the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination by the federal government. From this, the dissent argues in essence that state statutes should be held to provide the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination claims against state or local government actors under state law. As the dissent forthrightly acknowledges, this federal case law can only be persuasive authority, not binding precedent, in resolving the present case, which involves only questions of state law. We consider the dissent's attempted analogy to federal law to be unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>The dissent analogizes the present case to <i>Brown v. General Services Administration,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></a></span> (1976). In particular, our dissenting colleague relies on language in <i>Brown</i> \"that § 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment.\" <i>Brown, supra</i> at 835, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span>. However, as the dissent acknowledges, the claims in <i>Brown</i> were all statutory. <i>Post</i> at 889. Thus, at most, <i>Brown</i> can only stand for the proposition that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides the exclusive <i>statutory</i> remedy for discrimination in employment by the federal government because <i>Brown</i> did not involve a constitutional issue. Moreover, <i>Brown</i> stated that even before the extension of title VII in 1972 to cover federal employees \"an action seeking to enjoin unconstitutional agency conduct would lie....\" <i>Id.</i> at 826, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span>. Accordingly, consistent with our holding in the present case, <i>Brown</i> accepted as an established principle that a party could seek injunctive relief against unconstitutional governmental action.</p>\n<p>The dissent also contends that, in <i>Great American Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Novotny,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110103\"><a href=\"/opinion/110103/great-american-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-novotny/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">366</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110103\"><a href=\"/opinion/110103/great-american-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-novotny/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span> (1979), the United States Supreme Court \"made clear that <i>Brown's</i> reasoning extended to encompass the notion that title VII preempts constitutionally based claims as well.\" <i>Post</i> at 889. We disagree because <i>Novotny,</i> a case with only private parties as litigants, did not involve any constitutional claim. In <i>Novotny,</i> the male plaintiff alleged that he suffered unlawful employment discrimination because he opposed his former employer's practice of discriminating against female employees on the basis of sex in violation of the \"anti-retaliation\" provision of title VII prohibiting an employer from discriminating against an employee for opposing a violation of title VII. In pertinent part, the plaintiff in <i>Novotny</i> attempted to bring suit against that employer and its directors under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3). Essentially, 42 U.S.C. 1985(3) was the modern codification of a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute that generally provided a private cause of action against certain conspiracies to violate federally protected rights. The <i>Novotny</i> Court noted its concern that, if a violation of title VII could be asserted through this other statute, many of the provisions of title VII would be avoided. Accordingly, the <i>Novotny</i> Court declined to allow such a cause of action.</p>\n<p>We consider the dissent's effort to analogize the present case to <i>Novotny</i> unpersuasive <span class=\"star-pagination\">*880</span> for two critical reasons. First, inasmuch as <i>Novotny</i> did not involve a governmental defendant, it did not involve any constitutional claim of violation of the equal protection guarantees of the United States Constitution. Second, the plaintiff in <i>Novotny</i> was attempting to redress conduct that was prohibited by title VII through another, more generalized, federal statute, and his claim that title VII was violated was an essential aspect of his claim. In contrast, while the present plaintiff cannot proceed under the CRA because of the safe harbor provided by § 210, that does not mean that he cannot claim that the conduct at issue by the city of Lansing is violative of the state Equal Protection Clause. Thus, <i>Novotny</i> is simply inapposite to whether injunctive relief is available against governmental action that is unconstitutional if it is claimed that action violates the constitutional equal protection guarantees.</p>\n<p>The dissent further cites <i>Davis v. Passman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span> (1979), in support of its discussion of plaintiff's constitutional claim. <i>Post</i> at 888. However, we believe that <i>Davis</i> actually supports our analysis. In <i>Davis,</i> a female employee of a member of congress was informed by him in a letter that she was removed from her position because he concluded that it was \"essential\" that the position be held by a man. At that time, congressional employees like the petitioner in <i>Davis</i> were not protected from employment discrimination under title VII of the Civil Rights Act. See <i>id.</i> at 247, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2264</span></a></span> (\"[w]hen § 717 was added to title VII to protect federal employees from discrimination, it failed to extend this protection to congressional employees such as petitioner who are not in the competitive service\"). The United States Supreme Court held that the plaintiff in <i>Passman</i> could bring a cause of action directly under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment on the basis of sex discrimination in violation of its equal protection component. <i>Id.</i> at 242-244.</p>\n<p>Properly understood then, <i>Davis</i> supports our treatment of the constitutional claim in the present case. The plaintiff in <i>Davis</i> was unable to seek relief under the generally applicable federal statute against employment discrimination because, as a congressional employee, she was not covered by that statute. Similarly, because of § 210, the state CRA provides no recourse for a person who alleges that conduct by a governmental employer pursuant to an affirmative action plan properly approved under § 210 constitutes unconstitutional employment discrimination in violation of art. 1, § 2. In effect, a person who may have suffered unconstitutional employment discrimination under such a plan, assuming it is adopted and approved, is not covered by the CRA. Nevertheless, as in <i>Davis,</i> such a person is able to directly challenge the alleged constitutional violation.<sup>[13]</sup> Indeed, the <i>Davis</i> Court expressly stated that \"this Court has already settled that a cause of action may be implied directly under the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment in favor of those who seek to enforce this constitutional right.\" <i>Davis, supra</i> at 242, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2264</span></a></span>. In support of this principle, the Court referred to <i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></span> (1954). in which the Court held that \"equitable relief\" was available to plaintiffs challenging racial segregation in the District of Columbia schools as violative of the Fifth Amendment. See <i>Davis, supra</i> at 242-243, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2264</span></a></span>. As the <i>Davis</i> Court noted, the action in <i>Bolling</i> was predicated directly on the Fifth Amendment. <i>Davis, supra</i> at 243, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2264</span></a></span>. Thus, <i>Bolling</i> and <i>Davis</i> support a conclusion that injunctive relief is available to end a constitutional violation without the need for any type of implementing statute.<sup>[14]</sup></p>\n<p>The United States Supreme Court decision in <i>Smith v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span> (1984), also fails to support Justice Kelly's view that plaintiff may not directly seek injunctive relief under the Michigan Constitution. <i>Smith</i> involved claims that a handicapped child was denied a \"free appropriate public education\" in violation of, in pertinent part, the federal Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. 1400 <i>et seq.,</i> and the federal Equal Protection Clause. <i>Smith, supra</i> at 994-995, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3457</span></a></span>. The pertinent issue in <i>Smith</i> was whether the petitioners could recover attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. 1988, which generally allowed such a recovery in favor of plaintiffs seeking to enforce federal constitutional rights when the specifically applicable EHA, as then in effect, made no provision for awarding attorney fees. The Court concluded that attorney fees could not be awarded under 42 U.S.C. 1988, because Congress \"intended the EHA to be the exclusive avenue through which a plaintiff may assert an equal protection claim to a publicly financed special education.\" <i>Smith, supra</i> at 1009, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3457</span></a></span>. Accordingly, the issue involved in <i>Smith</i> was actually one of statutory construction or application, not of federal constitutional law. Thus, <i>Smith</i> does not support a view that a statute may preclude injunctive relief to end a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the <i>Smith</i> Court stated <i>\"where the EHA is available</i> to a handicapped child asserting a right to a free appropriate public education, based either on the EHA or on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the EHA is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parents or guardian can pursue their claim.\" <i>Smith, supra</i> at 1013, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3457</span></a></span> (emphasis added). At the very most, this can only reasonably be taken to support the view that, if a statutory remedy is available for an alleged constitutional violation, a party may be required to seek to a remedy that alleged constitutional violation through the procedures provided by the statute. However, as we have discussed above, plaintiff cannot challenge the alleged unconstitutional discrimination by defendant in this case under the CRA because of the immunity provided by § 210 of the CRA. Accordingly, because the CRA is <i>not</i> available to plaintiff, <i>Smith</i> provides no support for a contention that plaintiff may not directly seek injunctive relief under the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the <i>Smith</i> Court expressly stated:</p>\n<p>There is no issue here of Congress' ability to preclude the federal courts from granting a remedy for a constitutional deprivation. Even if Congress repealed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*882</span> all statutory remedies for constitutional violations, the power of federal courts to grant the relief necessary to protect against constitutional deprivations or to remedy the wrong done is presumed to be available in cases within their jurisdiction. [<i>Smith, supra</i> at 1012, n. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3457</span></a></span>.]</p>\n<p>This language makes clear that the United States Supreme Court in <i>Smith</i> did not regard the legislative branch as having the power through a statute to foreclose the ability of the judicial branch to order an end to constitutional violations.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Our dissenting colleague also attempts to analogize the present case to a large number of lower federal court decisions, see <i>post</i> at 892, in support of her position with regard to plaintiff's constitutional claim, while forthrightly acknowledging that \"[s]ome federal circuits have held that title VII does not necessarily provide the only remedy available for employment discrimination claims.\" <i>Post</i> at 892, n. 23. Given that we have already explained why we find the United States Supreme Court decisions on which the dissent relies inapposite and that federal law can at most be persuasive, not binding, authority in resolving the state law questions involved in the present case, we will not burden readers of this opinion with a further discussion of case law from the lower federal courts.</p>\n<p>We note that the dissent indicates that it would not allow plaintiff to pursue \"parallel constitutional claims to remedy wrongs cognizable under the CRA,\" <i>post</i> at 899, which, in plain language, means that a discrimination plaintiff cannot say, as this one effectively has, \"I do not claim that the statute is unconstitutional. I only claim the way the statute was used, or applied, is discriminatory and, thus, unconstitutional action has been engaged in by the state.\" In challenging such conduct as nevertheless constituting a violation of art. 1, § 2 of the Michigan Constitution, plaintiff is not asserting a claim that is \"parallel\" to an alleged violation of the CRA, but rather is seeking to invalidate conduct that is allegedly prohibited by the Michigan Constitution even though it does not violate the act. Said plainly, the unsettling position of the dissent is that, if the state actor (i.e., the city of Lansing in this case), commits ongoing employment discrimination that violates the state Equal Protection Clause, without also violating the CRA, the courts, when petitioned by the employee, have no ability to put an end to the unconstitutional discrimination. In an era in which one of the noble contributions of the state and federal courts has been to give citizens aid against discrimination, this is a startling proposition.</p>\n<p>Our dissenting colleague also indicates that \"the language of the [CRA], case law, and the legislative record persuasively support the proposition that our Legislature intended the [act] to be the sole remedy for state employment discrimination claims in Michigan.\" <i>Post</i> at 894. While the accuracy of this assertion may well be debatable, it is also irrelevant because it is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot grant a license to state and local governmental actors to violate the Michigan Constitution. In other words, the Legislature cannot so \"trump\" the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*883</span> Indeed, the ultimate import of the dissent is that, at least in the present context, a party cannot challenge discriminatory acts by a state actor in connection with its application or use of a statute as constituting unconstitutional discrimination under the state Equal Protection Clause at least one cannot do so without also attacking the validity of the underlying statute. This is profoundly misbegotten because the power of judicial review does not extend only to invalidating unconstitutional statutes or other legislative enactments, but also to declaring other governmental action invalid if it violates the state or federal constitution.</p>\n<p>That judicial review of governmental action for its constitutionality extends to governmental action in connection with applying a statute, without requiring a review of the underlying statute itself, is reflected in both modern and historic United States Supreme Court precedent. In <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 89, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (1986), the Court held that the federal Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from using peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors on the basis of their race. The <i>Batson</i> Court did not address whether the underlying provisions of the Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure that allow a prosecutor to use peremptory challenges, see <i>id.</i> at 83, n. 2, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span> were unconstitutional, or in any way suggest that they were. In fact, the Court observed that it \"has found a denial of equal protection where the procedures implementing a neutral statute operated to exclude persons from the venire on racial grounds.\" <i>Id.</i> at 88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1712</span></a></span>. Likewise, in the present case, the courts may review whether acts undertaken by the city of Lansing pursuant to its affirmative action plan, which was approved by the Civil Rights Commission under § 210, are violative of the state Equal Protection Clause without any need for plaintiff to challenge § 210 itself as unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this is not new law. One need only refer to the venerable, and celebrated, precedent of <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span> (1886), to understand this. <i>Yick Wo</i> involved two petitioners who were Chinese citizens and who were imprisoned upon convictions for violating a San Francisco ordinance that required a person to obtain the consent of the local board of supervisors to run a laundry business in a location other than a brick or stone building. Such consent was denied the petitioners and \"200 others who have also petitioned, all of whom happen to be Chinese subjects, [while] 80 others, not Chinese subjects, are permitted to carry on the same business under similar conditions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 374,<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span>.In light of this obvious discrimination, the Court considered the conclusion irresistible that the distinction was due to \"hostility to the race and nationality to which the petitioners belong.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the Court held, without invalidating the San Francisco ordinance, that the discrimination was violative of the federal Equal Protection Clause and ordered the release of the petitioners. <i>Id.</i> Of particular note in the present case, the Court in <i>Yick Wo</i> stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Though the law itself be fair on its face, and impartial in appearance, yet, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as practically to make unjust and illegal discrimination between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, the denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the constitution. [<i>Id.</i> at 373-374, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1064</span></a></span>.]</blockquote>\n<p>Consistent with this recognition, it is axiomatic, and has been for over a century, that the plaintiff here may challenge the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*884</span> particular \"application\" of § 210 by defendant in connection with defendant's affirmative action policies without asserting (or considering) whether § 210 is constitutional.</p>\n<p>We note that our decision in this case certainly does not deny substantial practical effect to § 210 of the CRA.<sup>[16]</sup> Indeed, we have held that plaintiff's statutory claim under the Civil Rights Act (and with it the possibility of recovering money damages or other compensatory relief) is barred by § 210. Further, plaintiff is able to bring a constitutional claim under art. 1, § 2 because the present defendant, as a governmental entity, is directly bound to obey the equal protection guarantees of this constitutional provision. At least generally, that would not be the case with regard to a private employer that uses an affirmative action plan properly approved by the Civil Rights Commission under § 210. See <i>Woodland v. Michigan Citizens Lobby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2189706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2189706/woodland-v-citizens-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">188</span></a></span>, 205, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2189706\"><a href=\"/opinion/2189706/woodland-v-citizens-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span> (1985) (\"The Michigan Constitution's Declaration of Rights provisions have never been interpreted, as extending to purely private conduct; these provisions have consistently been interpreted as limited to protection against state action\"); <i>Harvey v.

Obviously, nothing in this opinion would prevent such a private employer from relying on § 210 as a bar to an employment discrimination claim under the CRA.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the dissent would create a special rule for claims of employment discrimination in violation of art. 1, § 2 (or at least for such claims in the affirmative action context) that would preclude a plaintiff from directly seeking injunctive or declaratory relief against governmental action as being violative of this constitutional provision. Rather, such a plaintiff would, if the dissent's view were to prevail, either have to first establish a statutory violation or argue that a state statute is unconstitutional in order to directly challenge the alleged constitutional violation. We see no appropriate basis for imposing such a heightened duty in this context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>We conclude that § 210 bars statutory liability under the CRA for employment discrimination where an employer acts in accordance with an affirmative action plan properly approved by the commission. The decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals dismissing plaintiff's CRA claims are affirmed.</p>\n<p>The existence of the safe harbor does not abrogate rights guaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution. We hold that the trial court erred by dismissing plaintiff's constitutional claim for injunctive relief. Moreover, plaintiff has preserved this claim for appellate review. Therefore, the Court of Appeals decision on the constitutional claim is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for consideration of plaintiff's prayer for injunctive relief under art. 1, § 2.</p>\n<p>CORRIGAN, C.J., and MICHAEL F.

Furthermore, I agree with the analysis set forth by the majority in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p>However, I write separately to observe that, in order for an affirmative action plan to be <i>properly</i> approved by the Civil Rights Commission, it must comply fully with the requirements set forth in § 210. Section 210's safe harbor encompasses only affirmative action plans that are \"adopt[ed] and carr [ied] out ... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity....\" M.C.L. § 37.2210. Therefore, where the commission fails to apply these standards in its examination of an affirmative action plan, the plan has not been <i>properly</i> approved by the commission.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Because plaintiff has not preserved the issue whether the commission complied with the requirements of § 210 when it approved defendant's affirmative action plan, the majority does not address this issue. This silence, however, should not mislead some to believe that the commission possesses plenary authority to shield from liability <i>any</i> affirmative action plan. Rather, the commission is confined, not only by the requirements of the constitution, but also by the requirements of § 210 itself. To reiterate, under § 210, the commission only has the authority to approve, and thus to shield from liability under the Civil Rights Act, affirmative action plans that are \"adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out ... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity....\"<sup>[2]</sup><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*886</span> MARILYN J.

I also agree that the mere existence of the safe harbor does not abrogate rights generally guaranteed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution.<sup>[3]</sup> However, I cannot agree that acts of an employer that are protected by the safe harbor are subject to an equal protection challenge pursued directly under art. 1, § 2. Accordingly, because I believe that our Legislature intended the CRA to provide the exclusive remedy for public employment discrimination claims within the act's purview, I register my dissent.</p>\n<p>Our constitution protects against discrimination at the hands of state actors by declaring that \"[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.... <i>The legislature shall implement this section by appropriate legislation.\" </i> Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2 (emphasis added).

THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION OF 1961</h2>\n<p>The reference to equal protection \"of the laws,\" found in both the state and federal constitutions, suggests a safeguard against the formation and execution of laws or legislative classification schemes that operate unequally. It is well settled that the equal protection guarantee is not a source of substantive rights or liberties; rather, it is a measure of a constitution's tolerance of government classification schemes. <i>Doe v.

Delegates from both political parties viewed the proposed equal protection clause as a general statement of Michigan's policies and goals with respect to public discrimination. Drafters of art. 1, § 2, envisioned legislators, not constitutional delegates, as the authorities vested with the power to implement those goals. James K. Pollock, Republican chairman of the Committee on Rights, Suffrage, and Elections for the 1961 convention, observed the following as he presented his committee's proposed equal protection clause to the delegation:</p>\n<blockquote>We felt that, in the event we wanted to have a specific nondiscrimination clause, it would be better to state as a general policy of the constitution that there shall be no discrimination based on race, religion or national origin in the enjoyment of political or civil rights, and <i>that the legislature should have the power to enforce this by appropriate legislation.</i> [2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, pp. 741-742 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*887</span> To be sure, Delegate Harold Norris, a Democrat, expressed agreement with this basic principle of legislative delegation despite his disagreement with other aspects of the recommendation tendered by Pollock's committee. Professor Norris described the constitution as \"a statement of goals and not a detailing of means.\" <i>Id.</i> at 742, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Don Binkowski, another Democratic delegate on the Pollock committee, characterized the constitution as a guiding document that \"must point the way\" by providing a \"strong, resolute and bold restatement of the principles on which this country has been founded.\" <i>Id.</i> at 746, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

TITLE VII</h2>\n<p>We have long recognized that federal courts' interpretations of the law under circumstances analogous to those before us on review are highly persuasive although not necessarily binding on us. <i>Continental Motors v. Muskegon Twp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2012820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2012820/continental-motors-corp-v-muskegon-twp/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 194, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2012820\"><a href=\"/opinion/2012820/continental-motors-corp-v-muskegon-twp/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span> (1961).

The United States Supreme Court expressly recognized this fact in <i>Smith v. Robinson</i><sup>[5]</sup>, where it observed:</p>\n<blockquote>In light of the comprehensive nature of the procedures and guarantees set out in the [Education of the Handicapped Act] and Congress' express efforts to place on local and state educational agencies the primary responsibility for developing a plan to accommodate the needs of each individual handicapped child, we find it difficult to believe that Congress also meant to leave undisturbed the ability of a handicapped child to go directly to court with an equal protection claim to a free appropriate public education. Not only would such a result render superfluous most of the detailed procedural protections outlined in the statute, but, more important, it would also run counter to Congress' view that the needs of handicapped children are best accommodated by having the parents and the local education agency work together to formulate an individualized plan for each handicapped child's education. No federal district court presented with a constitutional claim to a public education can duplicate that process.</blockquote>\n<p>The <i>Smith</i> Court held that the Education of the Handicapped Act (EA) provided the exclusive avenue through which the plaintiffs could assert an equal protection claim for publicly funded special education.<sup>[6]</sup> Justice Blackmun recognized the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*888</span> possibility that broadly drafted legislation <i>could</i> preempt an entire field of substantive law. The Supreme Court further acknowledged that a comprehensive remedial act, such as the EA, will rightfully preclude the availability of parallel constitutional claims because such duplication would undermine the thoroughness of the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>I find highly persuasive here the reasoning employed by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Smith.</i> It is the same rationale that backed the Court's earlier holdings that Congress intended title VII<sup>[7]</sup> to provide the exclusive judicial remedy for discrimination claims in the federal employment sector. See <i>Brown v. General Services Administration;</i><sup>[8]</sup><i>Great American Fed S &amp; L Ass'n v. Novotny</i>;<sup>[9]</sup><i>Davis v. Passman</i><i>.</i><sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Brown</i> involved an African-American federal government employee who claimed that the General Services Administration (GSA) had racially discriminated against him by failing to promote him to a higher grade. He filed a complaint with the GSA, then appealed to the federal Civil Service Commission, both of which ruled against him. He then appealed from the commission decision to a federal district court. The suit alleged jurisdiction under title VII as amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972,<sup>[11]</sup> the general federal-question statute,<sup>[12]</sup> the declaratory judgment act<sup>[13]</sup> and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended.<sup>[14]</sup> The district court dismissed the entire action for failure to conform to the procedural requirements of § 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.<sup>[15]</sup> The Court of Appeals affirmed. <i>Brown v. General Services Administration,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"323986\"><a href=\"/opinion/323986/8-fair-emplpraccas-1299-8-empl-prac-dec-p-9802-clarence-brown-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span> (C.A.2, 1974).</p>\n<p>In deciding the case, the Supreme Court engaged in a detailed review of the legislative history underlying the enactment of the 1972 amendments to title VII. It noted that comprehensive administrative, judicial and remedial schemes have been included there. It viewed the enactment of § 717 as clear evidence of what Congress intended when it passed the 1972 title VII amendments. It quoted extensively from <span class=\"star-pagination\">*889</span> committee reports and floor debates to ascertain the will of Congress, before concluding:</p>\n<blockquote>This unambiguous congressional perception seems to indicate that the congressional intent in 1972 was to create an exclusive, pre-emptive administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of federal employment discrimination. [<i>Brown,</i> 425 U.S. at 828-829, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span>.]</blockquote>\n<p><i>Brown</i> denounced the idea that circuitous pleading might enable a party to avoid the preemptive scheme set forth in title VII. It observed that an attempt to circumvent the command of title VII would defeat Congress' purpose of amending the statute in 1972.</p>\n<blockquote>The crucial administrative role that each agency together with the Civil Service Commission was given by Congress in the eradication of employment discrimination would be eliminated \"by the simple expedient of putting a different label on (the) pleadings .\" It would require the suspension of disbelief to ascribe to Congress the design to allow its careful and thorough remedial scheme to be circumvented by artful pleading. [<i>Brown,</i> 425 U.S. at 833, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span>, quoting <i>Preiser v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span> (1973).]</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiff's other statutory claims were preempted by title VII. It affirmed the lower courts and held:</p>\n<blockquote>[T]he established principle [found in <i>Preiser</i> ] leads unerringly to the conclusion that § 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employment. [<i> </i><i>Brown,</i> 425 U.S. at 835, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span>.]</blockquote>\n<p>Though the remedies sought in <i>Brown</i> were all statutory, its holding was broader and unqualified. In <i>Novotny, supra,</i> the Supreme Court made clear that <i>Brown's</i> reasoning extended to encompass the notion that title VII preempts constitutionally based claims as well. <i>Novotny</i> brought an equal protection claim through the vehicle of § 1985(3),<sup>[16]</sup> and an action under § 704(a),<sup>[17]</sup> the retaliatory discharge provision of title VII. The <i>Novotny</i> Court relied on the principles set forth in <i>Brown</i> to hold that title VII foreclosed plaintiff's equal protection claim. It recognized that the availability of parallel constitutional relief, under these circumstances, would dramatically undercut the effectiveness of title VII. Comparing <i>Novotny</i> to <i>Brown,</i> the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<p>Here, the case is even more compelling. In <i>Brown,</i> the Court concluded that § 717 displaced other causes of action arguably available to assert substantive rights similar to those granted by § 717. Section 1985(3), by contrast, creates no rights. It is a purely remedial statute, providing a civil cause of action when some otherwise defined federal rightto equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under the lawsis breached by a conspiracy in the manner defined by the section. Thus, we are not faced in this case with a question of implied repeal. The right Novotny claims under § 704(a) did not even arguably exist before the passage of Title VII. The only question here, therefore, is whether the rights created by Title VII may be asserted within the remedial framework of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*890</span> § 1985(3). [<i>Novotny, supra</i> at 376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110103\"><a href=\"/opinion/110103/great-american-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-novotny/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2345</span></a></span>.]</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court answered this question in the negative. Applying <i>Brown's</i> holding broadly,<sup>[18]</sup> it observed that restricting the plaintiff to an action under title VII was the only way to preserve the integrity of title VII's remedial scheme. Notwithstanding <i>Novotny's</i> broad constitutional claims, the Supreme Court continued:</p>\n<blockquote>If a violation of Title VII could be asserted through § 1985(3) [in the form of a constitutional claim], a complainant could avoid most if not all of these detailed and specific provisions of the law.... Perhaps most importantly, the complaint could completely bypass the administrative process, which plays such a crucial role in the scheme established by Congress in Title VII. [<i>Id.</i> at 375-376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110103\"><a href=\"/opinion/110103/great-american-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-novotny/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2345</span></a></span>.]</blockquote>\n<p>The majority responds that <i>Novotny</i> \"did not involve any constitutional claim[s]\" and therefore does not aid us in determining whether a statute can ever preempt a claim brought directly under the constitution.<sup>[19]</sup> My colleagues acknowledge that <i>Novotny</i> brought a claim under § 1985(3), but ignore the underlying substantive posture of any action pursued through the vehicle of § 1985(3). Although § 1985 is certainly a statute, it \"creates no rights,\" the <i>Novotny</i> Court observes, and is thus activated only \"when some otherwise defined federal right<i>to equal protection of the laws</i> or equal privileges and immunities under the lawsis breached by a conspiracy in the manner defined by the section.\" <i>Novotny, supra</i> at 376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110103\"><a href=\"/opinion/110103/great-american-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-novotny/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2345</span></a></span>. [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p>Hence, § 1985 is a remedial vehicle to pursue the vindication of constitutionally guaranteed rights. The <i>Novotny</i> Court was unequivocal when it declared that a violation of rights contemplated under title VII could not be asserted through a § 1985(3) claim. <i>Id.</i> at 375-376, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110103\"><a href=\"/opinion/110103/great-american-fed-sav-loan-assn-v-novotny/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2345</span></a></span>. It opined that pursuit of such a remedy would enable a complainant to \"avoid most if not all of [the] detailed and specific provisions of the law.\" <i>Id.</i> The majority is inaccurate in suggesting that using § 1985(3) to vindicate a violation of a constitutional right is substantively different than suing directly under the constitution.</p>\n<p>The majority uses its flawed analysis of <i>Novotny</i> as a springboard from which to leap to the general proposition that a legislative act can never \"trump\" the constitution. Nowhere in <i>Novotny</i> can one locate the principle that the majority attributes to it. Indeed, when the Supreme Court has addressed the subject of statutory preemption of constitutional remedies, it has reached the opposite conclusion.<sup>[20]</sup> It cannot be accurately said that <i>Novotny</i> lends credence to the conclusion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*891</span> that a constitutional claim can never be preempted by statute.</p>\n<p>The majority is unpersuasive in its attempt to distinguish <i>Smith v. Robinson</i><i>,</i> the Supreme Court case that <i>directly</i> addresses the principle of statutory preemption of parallel constitutional claims.<sup>[21]</sup> As discussed above, the <i>Smith</i> Court held that a complainant's equal protection claim was preempted by a statute, the EA. The majority reads <i>Smith</i> to mean only that \"if a statutory remedy is available for an alleged constitutional violation, a party may be required to seek to remedy that alleged constitutional violation through the procedures provided by the statute.\" Op. at 18-19. It then finds that Miss Smith's claims were covered by the EHA. and that <i>Smith</i> is inapposite here.</p>\n<p>The flaw in its logic lies in its premise. In <i>Smith,</i> the principle claim involved the right of a handicapped child to a free public education. The claim that went to the United States Supreme Court was for attorney fees. Under the facts in <i>Smith,</i> the plaintiff was covered by the act and was unable to obtain attorney fees under an equal protection claim. Under the facts in <i>Sharp,</i> plaintiff was covered by the act and sought relief for various equal protection claims. Hence, in each case a statutory remedy was available to and sought by the plaintiff and the plaintiff sought relief, as well, for the same alleged wrongs through a direct constitutional due process claim. Consequently, <i>Smith</i> is <i>pertinent</i> and supports my conclusion that a comprehensive legislative scheme can preempt certain constitutional claims where the Legislature is authorized and intends to preempt an entire field of law.</p>\n<p>In attempting to distinguish the holding in <i>Smith</i> from the one I propose today, the majority points to a footnote in <i>Smith.</i> In it, the United States Supreme Court remarks that, if there were no statutory remedies for constitutional violations,</p>\n<blockquote>the power of federal courts to grant the relief necessary to protect against constitutional deprivations or to remedy the wrong done is presumed to be available in cases within their jurisdiction. [<i>Id.</i> at 1012, n. 15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3457</span></a></span> quoted <i>ante</i> at 882.]</blockquote>\n<p>This observation has no bearing on what the Court in <i>Smith</i> actually did decide: when the Legislature implements a comprehensive remedial scheme to rectify certain constitutional equal protection rights, the scheme will preempt parallel constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>The footnote is dictum because the <i>Smith</i> Court found that Congress <i>had</i> implemented such a comprehensive remedial scheme in the EA. Examined closely, the footnote stands only for the proposition that, absent a statutory scheme to remedy equal protection violations, courts can grant appropriate relief directly under the constitution.</p>\n<p>This goes precisely to my point. Indeed, if there were no title VII, or no EA, there certainly would exist a role for the courts in remedying the constitutional deprivations those statutes address. The courts, within jurisdictional limitations, would fill the void in legislation and right wrongs through claims brought directly under the constitution. Yet the fact that Congress <i>did</i> enact such legislation is thought to manifest dissatisfaction with existing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*892</span> remedies the courts were providing. It is said to evidence a desire, instead, to replace unsuccessful solutions with a comprehensive scheme that preempts the field, including the very preexistent constitutional claims that warranted the legislation. Hence, the holding of <i>Smith</i> is that the EA's legislative history leads to the conclusion that the act \"is the exclusive avenue through which the child and his parent or guardian can pursue their claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1013, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111264\"><a href=\"/opinion/111264/smith-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3457</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Therefore, despite the majority's unsubstantiated assertion that a statute cannot \"trump\" the constitution, federal courts have long acknowledged the opposite principle.<sup>[22]</sup> Consistent with the logic working in <i>Smith,</i> these courts have applied <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny</i> to hold that title VII preempts constitutional equal protection claims that fall within the jurisdiction of the statute<sup>[23]</sup>.

The court concluded that the plaintiffs' constitutional claim was \"unavoidably foreclosed by [the] precedent\" of <i>Brown. Kizas,</i> at 345, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418699\"><a href=\"/opinion/418699/adolph-kizas-v-william-h-webster-adolph-kizas-v-william-h-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>. Their sole remedy was under title VII. The <i>Kizas</i> Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote>The Kizas complainants suggest, in repeated but less than lucid argument, that the Constitution's equal protection principle entails a stricter restraint on classification by race or sex than does Title VII and would shelter them against \"reverse\" discrimination that the statute may permit. We need not linger over this suggestion....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>They may not circumvent the \"careful and thorough remedial scheme\" Congress ordered for them; their access to court is determined by that effective, albeit demanding statute. [<i>Kizas,</i> at 345-346, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418699\"><a href=\"/opinion/418699/adolph-kizas-v-william-h-webster-adolph-kizas-v-william-h-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>.]</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. THE CRA</h2>\n<p>In the instant case, Sharp is covered by the protections afforded through the CRAa legislative enactment every bit as detailed and comprehensive as its federal counterpart, title VII.</p>\n<p>Section 717 contains a general prohibition of federal employment \"discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" § 717(a). Michigan's CRA contains a proscription at M.C.L. § 37.2202(1), which provides in part:</p>\n<p>An employer shall not ...:</p>\n<blockquote>(a) Fail or refuse to hire, or recruit, or discharge, or otherwise discriminate against an individual with respect to employment, compensation, or a term, condition, or privilege of employment, because of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, or marital status.</blockquote>\n<p>Section 717 also provides the Civil Service Commission with the power and authority to enforce the civil rights requirements of title VII. Michigan vests its own Civil Rights Commission with similar enforcement powers. Article 6 of the CRA delegates powers and duties to the commission, M.C.L. § 37.2601, and the Civil Rights Department, M.C.L. § 37.2602. Section 602(c) establishes in the Department the authority to</p>\n<blockquote>[r]eceive, initiate, investigate, conciliate, adjust, dispose of, issue charges, and hold hearings on complaints alleging a violation of this act, and approve or disapprove plans to correct past discriminatory practices which have caused or resulted in a denial of equal opportunity with respect to groups or persons protected by this act.</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, § 717(c) outlines a detailed administrative grievance procedure that a complainant must follow before filing suit in federal district court. It gives an aggrieved federal employee thirty days from a final order of the Civil Service Commission to register an appeal in a district court.</p>\n<p>Michigan's CRA provides an almost identical structure. See M.C.L. § 37.2605-37.2606. Section 605 requires the state commission to issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law to support a conclusion that an employer has engaged in discriminatory practices. The section also details the various remedies available to the commission following a finding of discrimination in violation of the CRA. Finally, § 606 provides the complainant with the right to appeal from any final decision of the commission to a circuit court within thirty days.</p>\n<p>The parallels that exist between title VII and the CRA are undeniable. Similarly, the concerns apparent in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny</i> about parallel claims that threaten to dilute the comprehensive scheme carefully crafted by Congress also exist here.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*894</span> Michigan's CRA provides the kind of detailed scheme that the United States Supreme Court recognizes as providing the sole remedy for claims arising under its coverage umbrella.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV. LEGISLATIVE INTENT</h2>\n<p>Moreover, the language of the act, case law, and the legislative record persuasively support the proposition that our Legislature intended the CRA be the sole remedy for state employment discrimination claims in Michigan. The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature. <i>Frankenmuth Mut. Ins. v. Marlette Homes, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251701\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251701/frankenmuth-mut-ins-v-marlette-homes/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 515, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1251701\"><a href=\"/opinion/1251701/frankenmuth-mut-ins-v-marlette-homes/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1998). Like title VII, the CRA does not contain an express description of its position in the constellation of antidiscrimination law. Thus, it is appropriate to look for legislative intent in other, less obvious places. <i>Brown, supra</i> at 825, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span>. \"Where the mind labours to discover the design of the legislature, it seizes everything from which aid can be derived....\" <i>United States v. Fisher,</i> 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 358, 386, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"84791\"><a href=\"/opinion/84791/united-states-v-fisher/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span> (1805).</p>\n<p>To begin, the language of the CRA itself manifests an apparent intent to establish a broad, comprehensive scheme that \"defines\" and remedies violations of civil rights. The preamble to the CRA begins: \"An act to <i>define civil rights....\"</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">453</span></span> (emphasis added). It continues by describing its own purpose as \"to prohibit discriminatory practices\" and \"to provide remedies and penalties....\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, on its face, the CRA shows that the Legislature envisioned it as comprehensive and detailed.</p>\n<p>The legislative history, as gathered from House and Senate bill analyses generated before the act's passage in 1976, bears out this suggestion. The legislative documents explain that the act was intended to address the problems caused by the splintered remedial systems that existed before 1976 in the area of civil rights. The report accompanying House Bill 4055 described the bill as a consolidation of these concepts into a single law that would</p>\n<blockquote>place legal and procedural recourse for <i>all civil rights discrimination</i> within the Department of Civil Rights, enabling the Department to provide more effective remedies for those who have been victimized by unlawful discrimination. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p>The bill analysis further describes the bill as a means of \"[outlining] more specifically the <i>legal action a person could take</i> if that person feels that he or she has been unfairly discriminated against.\" (Emphasis added.) The \"Argument For:\" section of the bill analysis includes the following two statements of purpose, both bearing particular relevance to this case:</p>\n<blockquote>The bill would provide a <i>uniform statutory framework</i> to deal with the many different forms of discrimination. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>The bill would include the concept of discrimination enunciated by the U.S. Supreme Court with respect to equal protection under the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p>Hence, the CRA, like its federal counterpart, was intended as a vehicle to define and consolidate the various remedial measures accorded by other statutes. Moreover, it was envisioned as incorporating the \"concept of discrimination\" inherent in the Equal Protection Clause.<sup>[24]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*895</span> Courts have interpreted the CRA as bearing a singular objective in harmony with the Michigan Constitution and as an instrument to interpret and enforce its provisions. See, e.g., <i>Thompson v. Bd. of Ed. Romeo Comm. Schs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427134\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427134/thompson-v-bd-of-ed-of-romeo-community-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></a></span>, 1380 (W.D.Mich., 1981) (interpreting Michigan law to conclude that the \"general object [of the CRA] is to define and protect certain civil rights of individuals under the jurisdiction of Michigan law\"); <i>Neal v. Dep't of Corrections,</i> 232 Mich.App. 730, 734, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2051562\"><a href=\"/opinion/2051562/neal-v-corrections-dept/\"><span class=\"volume\">592</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span> (1998)(\"[t]he act is remedial and must be liberally construed to effectuate its ends\").</p>\n<p>I find that the intent that appears to underlie the CRA supports the proposition that the Legislature meant it to provide the sole remedy for public employment discrimination claims in Michigan. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court's decisive interpretation in <i>Brown, Novotny,</i> and their progeny of the breadth of § 717 of title VII renders convincing guidance in determining the breadth of Michigan's CRA. Just as title VII provides the sole remedy for equal protection claims involving federal governmental employment discrimination, the CRA provides the sole remedy for Michigan governmental employment discrimination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V. ANALOGY</h2>\n<p>A Michigan complainant like Mr. Sharp is in the same position as the complainants in <i>Kizas.</i> He may not circumvent the \"careful and thorough remedial scheme\" that the Legislature, in response to the direct call of the people, has ordered for him. <i>Kizas,</i> at 346, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418699\"><a href=\"/opinion/418699/adolph-kizas-v-william-h-webster-adolph-kizas-v-william-h-webster/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>. His access to court \"is determined by that effective, albeit demanding, statute.\" <i>Id.</i> He may not pursue a state constitutional equal protection claim that falls within the purview of the CRA.<sup>[25]</sup> Allowing that a parallel and circuitous claim would dilute the CRA's purpose, just as allowing Novotny to seek constitutional redress would have diluted the carefully crafted scheme of title VII.</p>\n<p>In addition to the persuasiveness of federal analogous law is the sheer counter intuitiveness of allowing an equal protection claim to survive in this case. If a complainant were entitled to relief under the state Equal Protection Clause as an alternative to the CRA, the safe harbor provision would be dramatically weakened. If the safe harbor were destroyed, the CRA would fail in one of its essential <span class=\"star-pagination\">*896</span> purposes: to provide for affirmative action in order to alleviate past instances of discrimination.</p>\n<p>In turn, the delegates to the 1961 Constitutional Convention would have failed in their attempt to draft art. 1, § 2 as a set of policy goals \"pointing the way\" for the Legislature. Such a result is inconsistent with the expressed policy goals of the constitutional framers and the intent of the Legislature in enacting the CRA. In addition, it ignores the persuasive direction charted by the United States Supreme Court in <i>Brown,</i><sup>[26]</sup><i>Novotny,</i> and their respective progeny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VI. SHARP'S INADEQUATELY PLEADED CASE</h2>\n<p>A more detailed analysis of whether plaintiff has pleaded and preserved any other direct constitutional claim is appropriate here.</p>\n<blockquote>MCR 2.111 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) Statement of Claim. A complaint, counter-claim, cross-claim, or third-party complaint must contain the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(1) A statement of the facts, without repetition, on which the pleader relies in stating the cause of action, with the specific allegations necessary reasonably to inform the adverse party of the nature of the claims the adverse party is called on to defend[.]</blockquote>\n<p>In his second amended complaint, plaintiff pleaded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>7. Notwithstanding rejection of Plaintiff's application for employment as a fire fighter in the Lansing fire department, Defendant city of Lansing and the Lansing fire department have continued to accept applications for employment and have continued to hire persons as fire fighters who are not certified fire fighters and not as well qualified as Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>10. Defendant city of Lansing and its fire department have limited, segregated or classified plaintiff in a way that tends to deprive him of employment opportunities in the public fire department of the city of Lansing, or otherwise adversely affects his status as an applicant because of his race and sex.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>13. Defendant city of Lansing has adopted a policy of discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex and national origin by means of treating white male applicants for employment less favorably than applicants who are not white males.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>14. Defendant city of Lansing has applied its policy of discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex and national origin to the Lansing fire department.</blockquote>\n<p>15. Defendant city of Lansing and its fire department have manipulated facially <span class=\"star-pagination\">*897</span> neutral testing procedures to discriminate on the basis of race, sex and national origin by means of giving second, third and fourth chances to members of favored races, sex or national origin.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>* * *</h2>\n<blockquote>18. Defendant city of Lansing obtained approval for a voluntary affirmative action plan in 1987 but has abandoned the approved plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>19. Defendant's affirmative action plan lacks any rational connection with a legitimate governmental objective for the reason that ten years of enforcement of the said voluntary affirmative action plan has had no effect on the distribution of women and minorities in the non-supervisory ranks of the Lansing fire department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>20. Defendant city of Lansing adopted both its <i>approved</i> voluntary affirmative action plan, and its <i>unapproved</i> voluntary affirmative action plan with intent to discriminate on the basis of race and sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>21. The only effect of ten years of voluntary affirmative action in the Lansing fire department has been to deprive white males of employment opportunities in the Lansing fire department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>22. Plaintiff has sustained damages in the premises in excess of $10,000.00, in violation of the form of the Elliott Larsen Civil Rights Act and Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Wherefore, Plaintiff prays that this Honorable Court enter its order enjoining Defendant city of Lansing from discriminating in employment on the basis of race, sex or national origin....</blockquote>\n<p>Plaintiff's pleadings acknowledge the apparent constitutionality of an affirmative action plan that has been approved by the commission and enacted in conformity with § 210. There is no dispute that the city's plan satisfies both criteria. In his answer to defendant's affirmative defenses, plaintiff stated:</p>\n<blockquote>Plaintiff affirmatively avers that an affirmative action plan may be adopted and carried out <i>\"if</i> the plan is filed with the commission under rules of the commission and the commission approves the plan.\"</blockquote>\n<p>As the majority concedes, plaintiff is barred from pursuing a claim under the CRA. By extension, then, he has failed to state a cognizable claim under the Equal Protection Clause of the Michigan Constitution. Simply stated, he has nothing left to pursue on remand.</p>\n<p>The majority misrepresents my position as asserting that the <i>only way</i> to challenge a state actor's implementation of a law is to challenge the law itself. It interprets this dissent as in conflict with <i>Batson v. Kentucky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span> (1986),<sup>[27]</sup> and <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91704\"><a href=\"/opinion/91704/yick-wo-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span> (1886).<sup>[28]</sup> In so doing, it overlooks a crucial fact that distinguishes <i>Batson</i> and <i>Yick Wo</i> from the instant case: the relationship of the underlying \"law\" to the conduct alleged in this case is distinguishable from the relationship of those two variables as they operated in <i>Batson</i> and <i>Yick Wo.</i> The key difference is that § 210 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*898</span> <i>expressly allows</i> the conduct in which defendant engaged. It permits racial discrimination within certain parameters. The city of Lansing governed itself within those constitutional parameters. Though he tried, Mr. Sharp could not establish a factual issue to the contrary .</p>\n<p>By contrast, the underlying law in <i>Batson</i> did not expressly allow the conduct in which the Kentucky prosecutor engaged. The \"law\" in <i>Batson</i> did not permit prosecutors to exercise peremptory challenges on the basis of race. It did not even address race. Thus, the unconstitutional implementation at work in <i>Batson</i> was found in the \"deviation\" from what the underlying constitutional law would allow. That \"law\" had been applied to Batson in a way that denied him equal treatment under it. I apply the same standard to Mr. Sharp's claim, but reach a different result because the law in his case operated exactly as legislators intended it should.<sup>[29]</sup> There was no deviation from the scheme intended by the Michigan Legislature.</p>\n<p>However, despite Mr. Sharp's failure to articulate a cognizable claim, another in his position would not necessarily be without a remedy. A complainant could challenge the constitutionality of the CRA generally, or of the safe harbor, testing whether either constitutes a constitutional implementation of art. 1, § 2. Sharp chose not to do so. Alternatively, a complainant could challenge the commission's approval of an affirmative action plan, arguing that the plan fails to conform to criteria required by the CRA for approval.<sup>[30]</sup> Again, Sharp chose not to pursue such a claim.</p>\n<p>Finally, a complainant could articulate a challenge to a public employer's actions in implementing a plan, by demonstrating that they fell outside the scope authorized by § 210. He could establish a fact question on such a claim by showing, hypothetically, that the employer hired a minority firefighter despite the fact that the individual had failed a required physical examination. Hiring such a candidate, who would not be qualified even with the benefit of the affirmative action plan, would not fall within the protection of the safe harbor. A complainant could establish a fact question whether the employer used some other <i>unapproved</i> plan, thereby violating complainant's rights. Such acts would not be protected by the safe harbor and the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*899</span> complainant's art. 1, § 2 rights could be vindicated under the CRA.</p>\n<p>Sharp attempted to create a fact question under certain of these theories, but failed. Hence, he is now left with nothing by way of an action arising either under the CRA or directly under art. 1, § 2. With no cognizable claims remaining that have not already been discharged, his In cause was properly dismissed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>VII. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>I agree with the majority that the safe harbor protects the city of Lansing from an action against it under the CRA. I further acknowledge that the Legislature cannot abrogate constitutional rights through passage of a statute. However, the constitution can delegate authority. The CRA is the Legislature's response to one such constitutional delegation of authority. I believe that art. 1, § 2, envisioned that the Legislature would pass an act like the CRA that could be the exclusive remedy for vindicating civil rights claims against public employers in Michigan. I base this conclusion on the expressed intent of certain constitutional convention delegates and by analogy to a persuasive line of federal authority regarding title VII and the Federal Equal Protection Clause. The CRA closely resembles title VII that the United States Supreme Court in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny</i> held preempted the field of employment discrimination claims under federal law. Allowing the pursuit of parallel constitutional claims to remedy wrongs cognizable under the CRA is not only illogical, it threatens to undermine and destroy the comprehensive design of the statute. Such a contrary ruling could not reflect the intent of either the Legislature in passing the act or the people in adopting the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p>The majority first misconstrues my position, then finds it \"a startling proposition.\" Op at 18. It states my position as being that, if a state actor commits ongoing employment discrimination violative of the state Equal Protection Clause but not violative of the CRA, the courts cannot end the discrimination. My position is that, if a state actor commits employment discrimination by performing acts covered by the CRA, the state Equal Protection Clause cannot be used to end the discrimination.</p>\n<p>I have demonstrated that this proposition has extensive support in holdings of the United States Supreme Court. Moreover, a contrary holding, the majority's holding, sadly weakens the \"noble contributions of the state and federal courts\" in fighting discrimination that it purports to esteem.</p>\n<p>The majority states that my reading of the law allows the Legislature to \"trump\" the Michigan constitution. It says that \"it is axiomatic that the Legislature cannot grant a license to state and local governmental actors to violate the Michigan Constitution.\" Op. at 21. However, a close examination reveals that this is mere rhetoric and misses the mark.</p>\n<p>Without dispute, the constitution can delegate to the Legislature the task of devising a comprehensive statutory scheme to protect specific constitutional rights. Art. 1, § 2 contains such a constitutional provision, and it is the one involved in this case. It is also beyond dispute that, when one person's constitutional rights conflict with another's, courts will render a decision whereby one right is sublimated to the other.</p>\n<p>This dissent, simply stated, stands for the proposition that, when a state actor discriminates against a person in a manner <span class=\"star-pagination\">*900</span> made lawful by the CRA, that person's art. 1, § 2 rights are sublimated to the art. 1, § 2 constitutional rights of others to have the state actor discriminate in their interest. Art. 1, § 2 delegated to the Legislature the power to implement it. In turn, the Legislature authorized the sublimation of one person's equal protection rights over another's when it created § 210.</p>\n<p>The majority also distorts the meaning of the dissent when it asserts that I would prevent the Court from hearing plaintiff'sclaim that defendant discriminated against him. It states that the dissent would prevent plaintiff from recovering for defendant's acts that, although not violative of the CRA, violate the Due Process Clause. However, one should note, it neglects to specify the acts. What conduct by defendant does plaintiff claim violated art. 1, § 2, but did not violate the CRA? In fact, plaintiff has named no governmental action by defendant that survived summary disposition, or that should have, and, that, also, violated the Due Process Clause .</p>\n<p>Here, Sharp cannot sue under the CRA because of the bar imposed by § 210. Both the nature of his claim and his pleadings preclude the availability to him of a parallel constitutional claim. The CRA provides his exclusive remedy. Because the Court of Appeals properly dismissed this action, I would affirm.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  MCL 37.2101 <i>et seq.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  Const. 1963, art. 1, § 2.</p>\n<p>[3]  It reversed in part, allowing plaintiff to amend his complaint to claim discrimination based on residency. This aspect of the ruling is not in dispute.</p>\n<p>[4]  The details of the plan itself are not central to the questions presented in this case. The stated goal of the plan was to increase the percentage of minorities and women in the fire department, which was composed predominantly of white males.

Rather, a plaintiff may seek injunctive or declaratory relief against the alleged constitutional violation</p>\n<p>[14]  The dissent misapprehends our consideration of <i>Bolling</i> in stating that our use of that case \"to predict the effects of a legislative act in 1972 evidences a remarkable twist of the laws of time and space.\" <i>Post</i> at 895, n. 25. We do not in any way rely on <i>Bolling</i> as indicating the intent of Congress in making any amendments to title VII in 1972. Rather, we rely on <i>Bolling</i> as indicating that a court may directly grant injunctive relief against a constitutional violation without regard to the content of any statute.</p>\n<p>[15]  Consistent with our holding today in <i>Lewis, supra,</i> we reiterate that judicial authority under the state Equal Protection Clause is limited to providing injunctive or declaratory relief to nullify unconstitutional legislation or otherwise stop a recurring violation of the state Equal Protection Clause. As discussed in <i>Lewis,</i> because of the language of the state Equal Protection Clause, any provision for compensatory relief or similar measures to positively <i>implement</i> the clause requires legislative action.</p>\n<p>[16]  We note that the present case does not involve a challenge to the constitutionality of § 210.</p>\n<p>[1]  In observing that \"a complainant could challenge the commission's approval of an affirmative action plan, arguing that the plan fails to conform to criteria required by the CRA for approval,\" <i>post</i> at 898, the dissent apparently does not disagree with this proposition. However, the dissent asserts that my \"sweeping interpretation, if accurate, would render the safe-harbor provision unworkable.\" <i>Post</i> at 898, n. 30. I have difficulty understanding why my view is a \"sweeping interpretation,\" when I am merely quoting <i>verbatim</i> the statutory language, i.e., \"[a] person subject to this article may adopt and carry out a plan to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity ...\" M.C.L. § 37.2210. I agree with the dissent that the \"safe harbor does not protect only those plans that <i>succeed</i> in eliminating present effects of past discrimination.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Rather, the safe harbor protects all properly approved plans that are \"adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity ...\"<i>but only such plans.</i></p>\n<p>[2]  The significance of this unremarkable observationthat the language of § 210 means what it saysarises largely in the event that the constitutionality of § 210 is ultimately sustained, in particular, if predicated upon the premise that what would otherwise be unconstitutional, i.e., a hiring plan allowing the government-as-employer to treat persons differently on account of religion, race, color, or national origin, is made constitutional by virtue of the standards set forth for affording an affirmative action plan a \"safe harbor.\" See <i>City of Borne v.

This is accurate. However, in analogizing the specific facts of <i>Davis</i> to this case, the majority overlooks the distinction that the claim at issue in <i>Davis</i> did not fall under the umbrella of title VII. The plaintiff there, by virtue of her status as a congressional employee, was not eligible for coverage under title VII. Thus, her ability to pursue a constitutional remedy would not undercut title VII's remedial scheme. Indeed, the <i>Davis</i> Court reaffirmed <i>Brown's</i> exclusivity principle.\n</p>\n<p>By contrast, this case involves an individual, Mr. Sharp, who is protected by the applicable legislation, the CRA. He is not barred by having a status that renders him outside the scope of its contemplation. His inability to state a successful claim under the CRA does not place him in the same position as the plaintiff in <i>Davis.</i> Factually speaking, he more closely resembles the plaintiffs in <i>Brown</i> and <i>Novotny,</i> where the Supreme Court restricted access to alternative parallel remedies. <i>Davis, supra</i> at 247, n. 26, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110097\"><a href=\"/opinion/110097/davis-v-passman/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Robinson</i><i>,</i> n. 6 <i>supra,</i> which lists federal cases that apply <i>Smith</i> in finding a statutory preemption of constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>[21]  The majority chooses not to \"burden readers of this opinion with a further discussion of case law from the lower federal courts,\" op. at 17, but opts to ignore the considerable line of federal cases that have applied <i>Smith</i> to find statutory preemption of constitutional claims. See n. 6.</p>\n<p>[22]  As stated in n. 6, numerous federal cases have cited <i>Smith</i> as authority for making the type of ruling that the majority claims cannot be made.</p>\n<p>[23]  Some federal circuits have held that title VII does not necessarily provide the only remedy available for employment discrimination claims. See, e.g., <i>Beardsley v. Webb,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675121\"><a href=\"/opinion/675121/lisa-m-beardsley-v-john-webb-and-john-r-isom-sheriff-of-loudoun/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">524</span></a></span>, 527 (C.A.4, 1994). However, many of these decisions dealt with claims arising from facts beyond the contemplation of title VII, such that recognizing them would not encroach upon the area defined by title VII.\n</p>\n<p>Even those circuits that have interpreted <i>Brown</i> narrowly have not, as the majority suggests, done so on the basis of any distinction between legal and equitable remedies. See, e.g., <i>Annis v. Westchester County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678810\"><a href=\"/opinion/678810/barbara-annis-v-county-of-westchester-new-york-ernest-j-colaneri-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span> (C.A.2, 1994); <i>Notari v.

Instead, most have so held on the basis that they disagree about the scope of coverage that Congress intended. The majority offers no case holding that it is beyond the inherent power of any legislative body to enact a statutory scheme that preempts parallel constitutional claims.</p>\n<p>[24]  The Equal Protection Clause of Michigan's Constitution is virtually identical to its counterpart contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. They are interpreted as embodiments of the same concepts. See, e.g., <i>Moore v. Spangler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1826195\"><a href=\"/opinion/1826195/moore-v-spangler/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span>, 370, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1826195\"><a href=\"/opinion/1826195/moore-v-spangler/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span> (1977); <i>Naudzius v.

Michigan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849167\"><a href=\"/opinion/849167/lewis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"849167\"><a href=\"/opinion/849167/lewis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span> (2001); issued with this decision, holds that a complainant has a direct claim under the constitution for equitable relief from an approved affirmative action plan. Op. at 15, n. 13. The issue in <i>Lewis</i> is whether this Court should recognize the existence of a claim for monetary damages directly under the Equal Protection Clause. It does not address whether a party can seek equitable relief under the auspices of the constitution.\n</p>\n<p>The majority miscasts my position in this dissent as one that leaves certain Michigan citizens entirely without civil rights or constitutional protections. Also, it cites <i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></span> (1954) as assuming that Congress would amend title VII eighteen years later to retain the availability of equitable relief directly under the constitution. The use of a 1954 Supreme Court case to predict the effects of a legislative act in 1972 evidences a remarkable twist of the laws of time and space. Moreover, <i>Bolling</i> is inapposite because it describes federal employment discrimination remedies that existed before 1972. The 1972 amendments of title VII were aimed at altering the legal foundation for pursuing federal employment discrimination claims in the public sector. <i>Brown, Novotny, Smith,</i> and each case upon which I rely, concern the state of employment discrimination law <i>after</i> 1972.</p>\n<p>[26]  To counter the unqualified, direct holding of <i>Brown,</i> the majority relies on a misreading of it. <i>Brown</i> does not state that the 1972 amendments to title VII left intact the availability of injunctive relief for federal employment discrimination directly under the Fifth Amendment. There is little question that the <i>Brown</i> Court regarded earlier remedies for employment discrimination in the public sector as impotent. See <i>Brown, supra</i> at 826, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109455\"><a href=\"/opinion/109455/brown-v-gsa/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1961</span></a></span> (\"If administrative remedies were ineffective, judicial relief from federal employment discrimination was even more problematic before 1972.\") Injunctive relief, like the balance of remedies available before 1972, effected nothing to merit celebration among opponents of workplace discrimination.\n</p>\n<p>According to the <i>Brown</i> Court, that was the weakness that Congress intended to address through the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972. Its aim was to preempt the field by providing a comprehensive, exclusive slate of remedies, displacing existing legal <i>and equitable</i> claims. I find that our Legislature intended the CRA to have similar preemptive force.</p>\n<p>[27]  Batson held that the federal Equal Protection Clause forbids a prosecutor from using peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors because of race.</p>\n<p>[28]  The <i>Yick Wo</i> Court found an equal protection violation where an otherwise neutral San Francisco city ordinance was applied unequally to citizens on the basis of race.</p>\n<p>[29]  Similarly, in <i>Yick Wo,</i> the law at issue did not expressly authorize discrimination on the basis of race. It established an approval process for operating certain types of laundry businesses in San Francisco. The process was used to deny business opportunities to Chinese immigrants, while granting them to non-Chinese applicants. The \"law\" in <i>Yick Wo</i> did not authorize city officials to treat Chinese applicants differently than others. Rather, it established a neutral permitting process. City officials applied that law unequally, thereby violating the equal protection guarantee of the constitution. Such a fact pattern is easily distinguishable from the instant case, where an admittedly constitutional statute prescribes the very discrimination from which plaintiff claims to have suffered.</p>\n<p>[30]  The concurrence is mistaken in its suggestion that I agree that the \"safe harbor encompasses only affirmative action plans that are `adopt[ed] and carr[ied] out ... to eliminate present effects of past discriminatory practices or assure equal opportunity....'\" op. at 2. The safe harbor does not protect only those plans that succeed in eliminating present effects of past discrimination. Section 210 contemplates protection for any properly approved plan that is reasonably created with the intention of eliminating discrimination or furthering equal opportunities in the workplace. The section specifically refers to plans \"to\" eliminate effects of discrimination, not plans \"that\" do in fact eliminate them. The concurrence's sweeping interpretation, if accurate, would render the safe-harbor provision unworkable.</p>\n\n</div>",
