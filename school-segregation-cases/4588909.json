EDUC. CODE ANN. 5 44.901).\n\n\n         You inform us that the YISD “wishes to purchase certain energy conservation services” from\nEnergy Education, Inc., a private energy management consulting firm. Request Letter, supra\nnote 1; see YISD contract, supra note 1, at 1. Under the proposed contract, Energy Education would\nagree to “conduct a comprehensive energy management consultation” for the district, and in so\ndoing, to undertake two tasks:\n\n                           1. To provide [the YISD] board and administration with an\n                  energy management program that will enable [the district] to monitor\n                  [its] energy consumption and costs through computerization       and\n                  thereby reduce the district’s energy consumption         and utility\n                  expenditures.\n\n                            2. To assist [the YISD] administration [to] account for energy\n                  . . . consumption . . . throughout [the] district. This accounting will\n                  result from [the] district’s [purchase and use ofl an energy accounting\n                  software program which is acceptable to Energy Education . . . , at a\n\n\n         ‘Letter from Honorable Jose R. Rodriguez, El Paso County Attorney, to Honorable Greg Abbott, Texas Attorney\nGenera1 (Mar. 12,2003) (on file with the Opinion Committee) [hereinafter Request Letter]; Letter from John Bernard,\nChief Operating Officer, Energy Education, Inc., to Hector Aranda, Director of Purchasing Services, Ysleta Independent\nSchool District, at 1 (Oct. 4,2002) (on file with the Opinion Committee) [hereinafter YISD contract].\n\fThe Honorable Jose R. Rodriguez       - Page 2       (GA-0100)\n\n\n\n\n                cost not to exceed $15,000 and annual renewals thereafter at a cost\n                not to exceed $1,500 per year. Energy Education will provide [the\n                district] with the support and assistance necessary . . . to implement\n                such a program of energy accountability.\n\nYISD contract, supra note 1, at 1. Energy Education would further contract to select two “energy\neducator/managers” from YISD’s staff, whom, although they will remain YISD employees, Energy\nEducation would train to adjust the district’s energy management system’s (“EMS”) programming\nby, among other things, changing “the temperature settings and run times of the HVAC, boiler and\nall other equipment . . . [that] is controlled by the district’s EMS as well as in each building’s\nlighting, sewer and water usage, time clocks and thermostat settings [that] are not controlled by the\ndistrict’s EMS.” Id. at 2. The energy educator/managers would also, with Energy Education’s\nassistance, collect and record “relevant data” and “use the computer software to create and maintain\nthe district’s energy . . . and utilities . . . consumption data . . . to provide an effective monitoring\nsystem for the district’s utilities consumption and costs.” Id. at 3. The YISD would agree to pay a\nmonthly fee of $43,700 for forty-eight consecutive months, although Energy Education would\nguarantee that the district’s total savings will exceed the cost of the monthly fees. See id. at 3, 5.\nThe contract would continue in effect after all payments are timely made\n\n                without further payments to Energy Education for so long as the\n                district . . . desires and continues to substantially implement Energy\n                Education’s        energy management       program.       During  such\n                continuation[,] the district may use all . . . confidential items and\n                other materials furnished to it by Energy Education and may continue\n                to implement and utilize the energy management program.\n\nId. at 6.\n\n         You ask whether section 44.901 of the Education Code would apply to this proposed\ncontract. See Request Letter, supra note 1, at 1. Subsequent to the date of your request letter, the\nlegislature amended section’44.901, and the amended statute became effective on June 20, 2003.\nSee Act of June 2,2003,78th     Leg., R.S., H.B. 2425, 8 5 (to be codified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN.\n5 44.901); http://www.govemor.state.tx.us/division/press/bills2003#hb     (listing signed bills); see also\nAct of June 2, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., H.B. 2425, 85 121(l), 123(a) (repealing Education Code\nsection 44.901, as amended in 2001, and providing that the bill is effective immediately).\nConsequently, we consider whether the amended section 44.901 would apply.\n\n        Section 44.901 authorizes a school district’s board of trustees to enter “an energy savings\nperformance contract in accordance with this section.” Act of June 2,2003,78th      Leg., R.S., H.B.\n2425,§ 5 (to be codified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 5 44.901(b)). Subsection (a) defines an energy\nsavings performance contract as\n\n                a contract for energy or water conservation measures to reduce energy\n                or water consumption or operating costs of school facilities in which\n\fThe Honorable    Jose R. Rodriguez   - Page 3        (GA-0100)\n\n\n\n\n                the estimated savings in utility costs resulting from the measures is\n                guaranteed to offset the cost of the measures over a specified period.\n                The term includes a contract for the installation or implementation of:\n\n                         (1) insulation of a building structure and systems within the\n                building;\n\n                         (2) storm windows      or doors, caulking or weatherstripping,\n                multiglazed windows or        doors, heat absorbing or heat reflective\n                glazed and coated window       or door systems, or other window or door\n                system modifications that     reduce energy consumption;\n\n                        (3) automatic energy control systems, including          computer\n                software and technical data licenses;\n\n                        (4) heating,  ventilating,    or air-conditioning system\n                modifications  or replacements     that reduce energy or water\n                consumption;\n\n                        (5) lighting fixtures that increase energy efficiency;\n\n                        (6) energy recovery systems;\n\n                       (7) electric systems improvements;\n\n                       (8) water-conserving fixtures, appliances, and equipment or\n                the substitution   of non-water-using    fixtures, appliances, and\n                equipment;\n\n                       (9) water-conserving     landscape irrigation equipment;\n\n                        (10) landscaping measures that reduce watering demands and\n                capture and hold applied water and rainfall . . . ;\n\n                       (11) rainwater harvesting equipment and equipment to make\n                use of water collected as part of a storm-water system installed for\n                water quality control;\n\n                        (12) equipment for recycling or reuse of water originating on\n                the premises or from other sources . . . ;\n\n                        (13)     equipment      needed   to   capture  water    from\n                nonconventional,      alternate sources, including air conditioning\n                condensate or graywater, for nonpotable uses;\n\fThe Honorable      Jose R. Rodriguez       - Page 4        (GA-0100)\n\n\n\n\n                           (14) metering equipment needed to segregate water use in\n                   order to identify water conservation opportunities or verify water\n                   savings; or\n\n                           (15) other energy or water conservation-related         improvements\n                   or equipment . . . .\n\nId. (to be codified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 4 44.901 (a)). A school district may finance the contract\n(1) under a lease-purchase contract; (2) with bond proceeds; or (3) under a contract with the provider,\nalthough, in any arrangement, the provider must “guarantee the amount of savings to be realized by\nthe school district.” Id. (to be codified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. tj 44.901(f)-(g)).        The school\ndistrict must award an energy savings performance contract “according to the procedures established\nfor procuring certain professional services by Section 2254.004, Government Code,” but must\npublish notice “in the manner provided for competitive bidding.” Id. (to be codified at TEX. EDUC.\nCODE ANN. § 44.901(h)).\n\n\n         The issue you raise is whether, for purposes of section 44.901, an energy savings\nperformance contract includes only contracts for the installation or implementation of improvements\nor equipment, or whether it also encompasses contracts solely for services. See id. (to be codified\nat TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 5 44.901(a)). A letter submitted in connection with this request, which\ncharacterizes the YISD contract as being solely for services, suggests that the contract is therefore\nnot subject to section 44.901 .2 Determining whether this proposed contract is solely for services or\nfor the installation or implementation of improvements or equipment, which may include computer\nsoftware, is a fact question and is not amenable to the opinion process. See Tex. Att’y Gen. Op. No.\nGA-0003 (2002) at 1 (stating that the opinion process does not determine facts); see also Tex. Att’y\nGen. Op. No. GA-0078 (2003) at 2 (stating that the attorney general does not construe particular\ncontracts). We answer only the legal question.\n\n         The term “energy savings performance contract” is defined to mean only “a contract for\nenergy or water conservation measures.” Act of June 2,2003, 78th Leg., R.S., H.B. 2425, 8 5 (to\nbe codified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 8 44.901(a)). Without more, it is unclear how broadly the\nlegislature intended the word “measures” to be construed. On one hand, the word “measures,” by\nitself, may include any plans or courses of action.3 Certain federal laws suggest that an “energy-\nsavings performance contract” or an “energy savings contract” may include contracts for services,\nsuch as energy audits. See Exec. Order No. 13,123, 9 703, 3 C.F.R. 180 (1999), reprinted in 42\nU.S.C. § 8251 (2000); 42 U.S.C. 8 8287c(3) (2000). On the other hand, other federal laws define\n\n\n\n          2Letter from Jon A. McCormick, Adams, Lynch & Loftin, P.C., to William S. Spears, President, Energy\nEducation, Inc., at 2 (Aug. 24,200l) (on file with the Opinion Committee) (setting out the writer’s understanding that\nEnergy Education’s “people oriented energy use management program” does not require installing or retrofitting any\nequipment, systems, or improvements).\n\n         3We found no helpful case law defining the term “measure.” In this context, the word is commonly understood\nto mean a plan or course of action. See IX OXFORDENGLISHDICTIONARY528(2d ed. 1989); TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN.\n6 311.011(a) (Vernon 1998).\n\fThe Honorable Jos& R. Rodriguez      - Page 5      (GA-0100)\n\n\n\n\nthe term “energy conservation measure” to mean a construction project or a building material or\ncomponent.    See 42 U.S.C. 6 6326(4) (2000); 7 C.F.R. 4 1721.104(b)(l) (2003); 10 C.F.R. 8\n435.302(k) (2003). The Texas legislative history sheds no light on the definition’s breadth. See,\ne.g., SENATEFINANCE COMM.,BILL ANALYSIS,Tex. H.B. 2425, 78th Leg., R.S. (2003); SENATE\nCOMM.ONNATURALRESOURCES,         BILLANALYSIS,Tex. S.B. 1494,77th Leg., R.S. (2001); HOUSE\nCOMM.ONENERGYRESOURCES,        BILLANALYSIS,Tex. H.B. 2277,77th Leg., R.S. (2001).\n\n          Given the ambiguity of the word “measures,” the second sentence of the definition serves to\nnarrow the definition’s scope to contracts that involve the installation or implementation of an\nimprovement or equipment only, such as those listed in subsections (1) through (15). See Act of\nJune 2,2003,78th Leg., RX, H.B. 2425, § 5 (to be codified at TEX.EDUC.CODEANN. 8 44.901(a)).\nThe term “includes” is typically a term of enlargement, “not of limitation or exclusive enumeration.”\nTEX. GOV’TCODEANN. 8 3 11.005( 13) (Vernon 1998). It “implies that [a] list is only partial” atid\n“‘illustrative.“’ Tex. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass ‘n/S. W. Aggregates, Inc. v. S. W. Aggregates, Inc.,\n982 S.W.2d600,608      (Tex. App.-Austin 1998,nopet.) (~~~~~~~BRYANA.GARNER,ADIcTIoNARY\nOF MODERN LEGALUSAGE43 l-32 (2d ed. 1995)). Subsection (15) in particular indicates that an\nenergy savings performance contract may be a contract for “energy or water conservation-related\nimprovements or equipment” only. Act of June 2, 2003, 78th Leg., R.S., H.B. 2425, 9 5 (to be\ncodified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 8 44.901(a)(15)) (emphasis added).\n\n         Accordingly, for a contract to be an energy savings performance contract under section\n44.901, it must be a contract for the installation or implementation of improvements or equipment\nintended “to reduce energy or water consumption or operating costs of school facilities” and “the\nestimated savings [must be] guaranteed to offset the cost.” Act of June 2, 2003, 78th Leg., R-S.,\nH.B. 2425,s 5 (to be codified at TEX. EDUC. CODE ANN. 9 44.901(a)); see Tex. Att’y Gen. 0p. No.\nJC-0410 (2001) at 3 (suggesting that, analogous to the ejusdem generis doctrine, an inclusive\ndefinition includes only items similar to those listed). Equipment for section 44.901 ‘s purposes may\ninclude conservation-related  software. CJ: Act of June 2,2003,78th Leg., R.S., H.B. 2425, 8 5 (to\nbe codified at TEX. EDUC. CODEANN. 4 44.901(a)(3)) (stating that an energy savings performance\ncontract may include a contract for “automatic energy contrdl systems, including computer\nsoftware”). A contract solely for services is not a contract for the installation or implementation of\nimprovements     or equipment and is therefore not an energy savings performance contract for\npurposes of section 44.901.\n\n         Whether the proposed YISD contract is solely a contract for services that is not subject to\nsection 44.901 is a question of fact that cannot be determined in the opinion process. To the extent\nthat it is an energy savings performance contract and therefore subject to section 44.901 of the\nEducation Code, the YISD must comply with section 44.901’s requirements, such as arranging\npermissible financing arrangements, filing a performance bond, and letting the contract in\naccordance with chapter 2254 of the Government Code.\n\fThe Honorable Jose R. Rodriguez    - Page 6      (GA-0100)\n\n\n\n\n                                       SUMMARY\n\n                       For purposes of section 44.901 of the Education Code, an\n               energy savings performance       contract is a contract to install or\n               implement energy or water conservation-related      improvements or\n               equipment, the costs of which the provider guarantees will be offset\n               by the resulting utility cost savings.
