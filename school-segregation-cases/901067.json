The action was filed against the University, its president, vice president and an assistant to the president.  The students contend that their constitutional rights were violated when they were suspended from the University without a hearing.  Their claim for relief is based on 42 U.S.C. 1983, 1985(3), 1986 and 1988.

They also contend that 'they have been singled out for suspensions while others in like situations and circumstances have not been so suspended, thereby depriving plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws as secured by the Fourteenth Amendment,' again giving rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. 1983.  Finally, they contend that 'they have been suspended as a result of a conspiracy on the part of the defendants,' which they contend gives rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3), 1986 and 1988.

The allegation that Fisk University receives a substantial portion of its revenues in the form of government grants from the State of Tennessee is not supported by the public laws of Tennessee, including appropriations bills.  We take judicial notice of that fact.  At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs could not refer to a single instance under the laws of Tennessee where the State Legislature has made grants to Fisk University.  Our independent research has disclosed no such legislative grants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The averment that the State of Tennessee has conferred upon Fisk University the power of eminent domain likewise is not supported by the public laws of Tennessee.  We find no such authority except the limited power conferred upon the University of Tennessee and accredited senior colleges to condemn property adjacent to the campus, which was granted by T.C.A. 23-1506.  This power was not extended to private colleges such as Fisk University until the enactment of Ch. 204, Tenn.Public Acts of 1959.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the allegation that Fisk University receives funds from the United States Government as irrelevant to the question of whether there is sufficient State involvement to constitute a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Inasmuch as the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983, is concerned only with state action and does not concern itself with federal action we lay to one side as entirely irrelevant any evidence concerning the participation of the federal government in the affairs of the University.  See Grossner v. Trustees of Columbia University, 287 F.Supp. 535, 547 (S.D.N.Y. 1968).'  Browns v. Mitchell, 409 F.2d 593, 595 (10th Cir.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the well pleaded facts averred in the complaint, considered cumulatively, do not evidence such State involvement as to transform the actions of the Fisk University officials into 'State action.'  This is particularly true when the matters of alleged State involvement are in no way concerned with the actions taken by the school officials.  The State of Tennessee does not control the president of Fisk University and certainly does not dictate the disciplinary policies of the school.  See, Browns v. Mitchell, supra; Grossner v. Trustees of Columbia University, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Brown v. Strickler, 422 F.2d 1000 (6th Cir.), is not controlling in the present case.  In Brown, a complaint was filed by several University of Louisville students against the University President and other officials claiming that the students' constitutional rights were violated when they were dismissed from the University by the defendants.  The claim for damages and an injunction was based on 42 U.S.C. 1983, and the District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  We reversed the District Court's decision.  It was clear, however, from the record in that case that the University of Louisville was a State supported school.  It is a Municipal University<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and it receives substantial financial support from the City of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' complaint, in addition to the unfounded allegations of State funding, alleges that Fisk University is a self-contained community providing the usual governmental function.  In Evans v. Newton, 382 U.S. 296, 86 S.Ct. 486, 15 L.Ed.2d 373, the Supreme Court held that the city of Macon could not maintain segregation in a municipal park by transferring title to the park to private trustees.  The Court's decision was based on the theory that parks, like fire departments, police departments, and utilities companies render a service that is essentially municipal in nature, thus making its control an act of the State.  The Court in Evans distinguished private universities as not being within the purview of its 'public function' concept.  We hold that Fisk University is not a public facility of the nature that would transform the disciplinary actions by the school officials in administrating the internal affairs of the University into 'State action.'  See, Browns v. Mitchell,  supra, 409 F.2d 593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conspiracy Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only contentions in the complaint regarding the alleged conspiracy are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This is an action * * * to recover damages from the defendants for conspiring for the purpose of depriving plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws and of rights, privileges and immunities under the laws and Constitution of the United States * * *.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Plaintiffs further allege that they have been suspended as a result of a conspiracy on the part of the defendants. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that these conclusory allegations are not sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3), 1986 and 1988.  See, Dunn v. Gazzola, 216 F.2d 709 (1st Cir.).  There are no facts alleged in support of the conclusions, and we are required to accept only well pleaded facts as true, L'Orange v. Medical Protective Co., 394 F.2d 57 (6th Cir.), not the legal conclusions that may be alleged or that may be drawn from the pleaded facts.  Sexton v. Barry, 233 F.2d 220 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 870, 77 S.Ct. 94, 1 L.Ed.2d 76; Ryan v.

The allegation that Fisk University receives a substantial portion of its revenues in the form of government grants from the State of Tennessee is not supported by the public laws of Tennessee, including appropriations bills.  We take judicial notice of that fact.  At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs could not refer to a single instance under the laws of Tennessee where the State Legislature has made grants to Fisk University.  Our independent research has disclosed no such legislative grants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The averment that the State of Tennessee has conferred upon Fisk University the power of eminent domain likewise is not supported by the public laws of Tennessee.  We find no such authority except the limited power conferred upon the University of Tennessee and accredited senior colleges to condemn property adjacent to the campus, which was granted by T.C.A. 23-1506.  This power was not extended to private colleges such as Fisk University until the enactment of Ch. 204, Tenn.Public Acts of 1959.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the allegation that Fisk University receives funds from the United States Government as irrelevant to the question of whether there is sufficient State involvement to constitute a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Inasmuch as the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. 1983, is concerned only with state action and does not concern itself with federal action we lay to one side as entirely irrelevant any evidence concerning the participation of the federal government in the affairs of the University.

This is particularly true when the matters of alleged State involvement are in no way concerned with the actions taken by the school officials.  The State of Tennessee does not control the president of Fisk University and certainly does not dictate the disciplinary policies of the school.  See, Browns v. Mitchell, supra; Grossner v. Trustees of Columbia University, supra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Brown v.

In Brown, a complaint was filed by several University of Louisville students against the University President and other officials claiming that the students' constitutional rights were violated when they were dismissed from the University by the defendants.  The claim for damages and an injunction was based on 42 U.S.C. 1983, and the District Court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.  We reversed the District Court's decision.  It was clear, however, from the record in that case that the University of Louisville was a State supported school.  It is a Municipal University<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and it receives substantial financial support from the City of Louisville and the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs' complaint, in addition to the unfounded allegations of State funding, alleges that Fisk University is a self-contained community providing the usual governmental function.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span>, the Supreme Court held that the city of Macon could not maintain segregation in a municipal park by transferring title to the park to private trustees.  The Court's decision was based on the theory that parks, like fire departments, police departments, and utilities companies render a service that is essentially municipal in nature, thus making its control an act of the State.  The Court in Evans distinguished private universities as not being within the purview of its 'public function' concept.  We hold that Fisk University is not a public facility of the nature that would transform the disciplinary actions by the school officials in administrating the internal affairs of the University into 'State action.'

Mitchell,  supra, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"284350\"><a href=\"/opinion/284350/donald-browns-ruth-buechler-mitchell-g-crane-and-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Conspiracy Allegations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only contentions in the complaint regarding the alleged conspiracy are as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'This is an action * * * to recover damages from the defendants for conspiring for the purpose of depriving plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws and of rights, privileges and immunities under the laws and Constitution of the United States * * *.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'Plaintiffs further allege that they have been suspended as a result of a conspiracy on the part of the defendants. * * *'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that these conclusory allegations are not sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. 1985(3), 1986 and 1988.
