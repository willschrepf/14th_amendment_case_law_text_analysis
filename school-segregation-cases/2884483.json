HILL and O’BRIEN1, Bankruptcy Judges.\n\n\nO’BRIEN, Bankruptcy Judge.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          The Honorable Dennis D. O’Brien, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the\nDistrict of Minnesota, sitting by designation.\n\f       Apex Oil Company (the “Debtor”) appeals from four bankruptcy court2 orders\nand a summary judgment entered in favor of Artoc Bank & Trust Limited (“Artoc”),\nallowing Artoc a claim in the Debtor’s bankruptcy case in the amount of $3,461,850. 3\nWe affirm.\n\n\n                                     I\n                           STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n       During the 1970's, Artoc was a secured lender to Uni Refining, Inc. (“Uni”).\nArtoc held an assignment of Uni’s accounts receivable and a security interest in Uni’s\ninventory. Notice of the assignment was placed on Uni’s invoices to its customers\nalong with instructions for them to send invoice payments to Artoc. In the course of\ntheir relationship, Uni encountered financial difficulties which caused it to file\nbankruptcy in February 1981. The Debtor was both a customer and vendor of Uni.\nShortly before Uni filed bankruptcy, the Debtor offset against two invoices it had\nreceived from Uni, amounts owing by Uni to the Debtor. The first offset occurred on\nDecember 18, 1980 in the amount of $ 390,648.44, and the second on December 31,\n1980, in the amount of $1,334,182.81.\n\n       After Uni’s bankruptcy, Artoc sued the Debtor and others in a Texas federal\ndistrict court alleging that the offsets were in violation of its rights as assignee of Uni’s\nreceivables. During the course of that litigation, the Debtor filed this Chapter 11\nbankruptcy case in December 1987. Artoc filed a proof of claim in the case based on\nthe alleged wrongful offsets, and the Debtor objected to the claim. The Debtor\nsubsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the objection, based on alleged\n\n       2\n        The Honorable James J. Barta, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the\nEastern District of Missouri.\n       3\n          $1,700,000 of this amount represents principal to which 10% prepetition\ninterest is to be added. The remaining $1,761,850 is allowed attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                             2\n\flack of notice to the Debtor of the assignment and estoppel. In 1991, the bankruptcy\ncourt ruled in the Debtor’s favor on the notice issue, without deciding the estoppel\nissue. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court also without considering the\nestoppel issue.\n\n       In September 1992, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district\ncourt and ruled for Artoc on the notice issue. The Court of Appeals declined to\naddress the merits of the Debtor’s summary judgment motion on the issue of estoppel,\nsaying only that it expressed no opinion on the matter. The Court remanded the\nproceeding to the district court with instructions that it remand to the bankruptcy court\nfor entry of judgment in favor of Artoc unless the Debtor prevailed on the estoppel\nissue. On petition for rehearing, the Court later added the following instruction:\n\n      If judgment is entered against Apex, the Bankruptcy Court should first\n      consider the issues of prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees. These\n      issues are not concluded by this opinion, and we express no view on\n      their merits.\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 537-38).\n\n       Artoc filed its motion for summary judgment on all issues, including the\nDebtor’s estoppel defense, in March 1993 in the remanded proceeding. The Debtor\nresponded with a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the issues of interest\nand attorneys’ fees, and the Debtor initiated discovery relating to all issues, including\nits estoppel defense. Artoc opposed any discovery relating to estoppel, but the\nbankruptcy court granted the Debtor’s motion to compel discovery in April 1993.\nArtoc then moved for leave to appeal the bankruptcy court’s discovery order and, in\nNovember 1993, the bankruptcy court stayed all further proceedings while that appeal\nremained pending in the district court. In the meantime, Artoc filed a petition in the\ndistrict court on June 29, 1993 for removal of the bankruptcy case to the district court\n\n                                           3\n\fbased on bankruptcy judge’s alleged bias and prejudice against Artoc. In April 1995,\nthe district court denied Artoc’s motion for leave to appeal the bankruptcy court’s\nApril 1993 discovery order, but directed the bankruptcy judge to disqualify himself\nfrom the proceeding. 4\n\n       In October 1996, the bankruptcy court, Judge James Barta, held a status\nconference in the proceeding. The Debtor had filed a motion to supplement the record\nwith additional facts on the issue of estoppel. The bankruptcy court encouraged the\nparties to supplement their earlier briefs with updated case law, provided Artoc an\nopportunity to respond to the Debtor’s request to present new facts on the estoppel\ndefense, and indicated that he would thereafter issue a written order deciding the\nrequest and memorializing other procedural matters dealt with in the status conference.\nArtoc filed its response in opposition to the Debtor’s request to present additional\nfacts on the estoppel issue on October 28, 1996. No further order was issued by the\nbankruptcy court regarding the proceeding, however, until September 1, 1999 when\nJudge Barta entered his Order denying Apex’s Motion for Summary Judgment and\ngranting Artoc’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n      The Debtor filed its Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment on September 13,\n1999, whereby the Debtor: sought vacation of the judgment and leave to present\nadditional facts on its estoppel defense; argued that Artoc had failed to establish that\nit had sustained damages; argued that the court had erred in providing for calculation\n\n\n      4\n          The bankruptcy judge disclosed to the parties that he had earlier\nrepresented Apex in connection with the subject matter of the disputed claim and\nthe district court agreed with the recommendation of a magistrate that the judge be\ndisqualified because his impartiality might reasonably be questioned as a result.\nThe district court ruled that no actual bias or prejudice had been shown. The court\ndetermined that the proceeding should be reassigned to another bankruptcy judge\nunder the circumstances, rather than be removed to the district court. (Appellant’s\nApp. at 108-09).\n\n                                           4\n\fof prejudgment interest by compounding it daily; and, argued that “The action of the\nEighth Circuit in sua sponte granting judgment for Artoc deprived Apex of its right to\na hearing - if not a trial - on the other defenses that it had pleaded when it moved for\nsummary judgment in 1990.” (Appellant’s App. at 270-72). By separate motion filed\non November 9, 1999, the Debtor for the first time requested 28% credit against the\namount of Artoc’s claim as otherwise finally allowed.\n\n       On December 18, 2000, the bankruptcy court issued three separate orders: one,\ndenying the Debtor’s motion to alter or amend the judgment and to allow the Debtor\nto present additional facts on the issue of estoppel, but amending the judgment to\nallow only simple interest on prepetition attorneys fees; a second, denying the\nDebtor’s motion for 28% credit against Artoc’s claim; and the third, determining and\nallowing the amount of Artoc’s attorneys fees as part of its allowed proof of claim.\nThe Debtor appeals from the court’s September 1, 1999 order and judgment, and\nfrom the three December 18, 2000 orders.\n\n                                          II\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\nSupplementing The Factual Summary Judgment Record On Estoppel.\n\n      We review the bankruptcy court’s denial of the Debtor’s motion to supplement\nthe factual summary judgment record on estoppel under the abuse of discretion\nstandard. Williams v. Little Rock Municipal Water Works, 21 F.3d 218, 224 (8th Cir.\n1994). We find no abuse of discretion.\n\n       Trial courts have broad discretion in deciding whether to permit supplementation\nof the summary judgment record, and courts of appeal will not interfere with a judge’s\nexercise of discretion in this area except when abused. Lujan v. National Wildlife\nFed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 894-98 (1990). In the Eighth Circuit, a trial court’s exercise of\n\n                                           5\n\fits discretion in refusing to accept late-filed summary judgment evidence will not be\ndisturbed on appeal even where a procedurally adequate motion had been filed before\nentry of summary judgment. African American Voting Rights Fund, Inc. v. Villa, 54\nF.3d 1345, 1350 (8th Cir. 1995) (not an abuse of discretion to deny a party leave to\nsubmit supplemental affidavits 31 days after summary judgment record closed where\nparty retained new counsel); Metropolitan Fed. Bank of Iowa F.S.B. v. W.R. Grace\n& Co., 999 F.2d 1257, 1259 (8th Cir. 1993).\n\n      The Debtor filed its motion for summary judgment on its objection to Artoc’s\nclaim in the bankruptcy court on February 27, 1990. The motion was based on the\nDebtor’s alleged lack of notice of Artoc’s assignment of the accounts that it had offset\nagainst, and based on the defense of estoppel. Regarding estoppel, the motion pled:\n\n                ARTOC’S CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY ESTOPPEL\n\n      The summary judgment evidence shows that, as a matter of law, Artoc\n      had actual notice that Apex and other account debtors of Uni Refining\n      were paying invoices directly to Uni and were engaging in the industry\n      practice of “net-outs”, i.e. the set-off of mutual obligations. The\n      summary judgment evidence also shows as a matter of law that Artoc\n      Bank did not object to the direct payments and set-offs and took no\n      action to stop them.\n\n      As a matter of law, Artoc is estopped to contend that Apex should not\n      have set-off its invoices against amounts it owed to Uni.\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 215-16). In remanding the proceeding in September 1992, the\nCourt of Appeals held:\n\n                                          III.\n\n                                           6\n\f      Finally, Apex argues that even if Artoc gave sufficient notice of the\n      assignment, it is estopped to recover on the invoices since it knew Apex\n      was engaging in setoffs with Uni and took no action to stop this practice.\n      Neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the District Court reached this issue.\n      They did not determine what the law requires to establish the defense of\n      estoppel, nor did they find the facts to refute or support it. Therefore,\n      the issue is not properly before us. We leave it for development on\n      remand to the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n                                        IV.\n      We reverse and remand to the District Court. That Court is instructed\n      to vacate its judgment and remand the cause to the Bankruptcy Court\n      with instructions to enter judgment for Artoc, unless it determines that\n      Artoc is estopped to recover on the debt. As to the merits of the\n      estoppel theory, we express no view.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, 975 F.2d 1365, 1370 (8th Cir.\n1992).\n\n      Artoc filed its motion for summary judgment on February 4, 1993 in the\nremanded proceeding. Regarding estoppel, the motion pled:\n\n      Partial summary judgment on the affirmative defense of estoppel is\n      compelled by the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the\n      Eighth Circuit in Artoc Bank & Trust, Ltd. v. Apex Oil Co., 975 F.2d\n      1365 (8th Cir. 1992), in conjunction with the material facts not in dispute\n      regarding the estoppel defense.\n\n(Appellee’s App. at 2)\n\n\n                                          7\n\f        The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in failing to\ngrant the Debtor’s motion to supplement its response to Artoc’s February 4, 1993\nmotion for summary judgment with additional facts related to estoppel developed by\nthe Debtor after remand from the Court of Appeals in 1992. The Debtor argues in its\nbrief filed in this appeal:\n\n      The bankruptcy court abused its discretion by denying Apex the\n      opportunity to supplement its opposition to Artoc’s Motion for\n      Summary Judgment. (App. at 339). By denying Apex’s request for leave\n      to supplement, the bankruptcy court effectively prevented Apex from\n      presenting additional facts and raising additional bases for its estoppel\n      argument. (App. at 72-73; 270). Those facts would buttress Apex’s\n      claim that Artoc was barred by quasi-estoppel from collecting on its\n      claim...\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 6). The Debtor argues on that:\n\n      ...Apex filed its original Motion for Summary Judgment in this matter on\n      February 27, 1990. (App. at 210-68). In that motion, Apex asserted that\n      it was entitled to summary judgment for two reasons: (1) because it did\n      not get proper notice of Uni’s assignment to Artoc; and (2) because\n      Artoc was estopped from pursuing its claims. (App at 214-16). Under\n      Texas law, [] the defense of estoppel includes the doctrines of\n      quasi-estoppel, as well as equitable estoppel.[]\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 6-7). Apparently, the Debtor acknowledges that these defenses\nwere included in the Debtor’s 1990 motion for summary judgment on estoppel and,\nit seems by necessary inference, that no material issues of fact pertained to any of\nthem when the Debtor filed the motion.\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      The Debtor references its request to supplement the factual record as a motion\nunder Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7056 to supplement its response to Artoc’s motion for\nsummary judgment. However, Artoc’s motion was simply a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment on the issue of estoppel that was pending in the Debtor’s own\nmotion for summary judgment. The only thing added by Artoc’s motion to the\nDebtor’s then pending motion was discussion of facts articulated from the record\nbefore it by the Court of Appeals that Artoc believed controlled determination of the\nmatter.\n\n      The Debtor has pointed to nothing in Rule 7056 that would tend to support,\nmuch less compel, the granting of the motion to supplement under these\ncircumstances. Furthermore, supplementing the record with additional facts would\nhave been futile anyway because, as discussed later, the defense of estoppel on any\nof the Debtor’s theories is barred by uncontested facts that are core to all theories of\nestoppel.\n\n      The Debtor was not entitled to supplement the factual record long since closed\nby the Debtor’s own pending motion, and the bankruptcy court’s failure to grant the\nDebtor’s motion to supplement its response to Artoc’s motion for summary judgment\nby addition of facts relating to estoppel was not an abuse of discretion. 5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n         Apparently, the bankruptcy judge thought that he had granted the Debtor’s\nrequest during the October 17, 1996 status conference, as he discussed in his\nDecember 18, 2000 order denying the Debtor’s motion to alter or amend.\nHowever, review of the transcript of the hearing shows that the judge had intended\nto rule on the motion in a written order after Artoc responded to it, which Artoc did\non October 28, 1996.\n\n                                           9\n\fSummary Judgment For Artoc Was Proper.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary\njudgment for Artoc for the following reasons: 1) the bankruptcy court misapplied the\nlaw of the case doctrine; 2) the Debtor established a fact issue on each element of its\nestoppel defense; 3) the bankruptcy court disregarded the Debtor’s quasi-estoppel and\nrelated defenses; and, 4) Artoc suffered no damages due to the setoffs taken by the\nDebtor.\n\n       We review the bankruptcy court’s grant of summary judgment to Artoc de\nnovo. Comsat Corp. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 246 F.3d 1101, 1105 (8th\nCir. 2001). We conclude that the bankruptcy court properly applied the law of the\ncase doctrine, and that summary judgment was otherwise properly considered and\nentered in favor of Artoc.\n\n1. Application Of Law Of The Case Doctrine.\n\n      The law of the case doctrine applied by the Eighth Circuit, is:\n\n      When a case has been decided by this court on appeal and remanded to\n      the District Court, every question which was before the court and\n      disposed of by its decree is finally settled and determined. The District\n      Court is bound by the decree and must carry it into execution according\n      to the mandate. It cannot alter it, examine it except for purposes of\n      execution, or give any further or other relief or review of it for apparent\n      error with respect to any question decided on appeal.\n\nHoughton v. McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 627 F.2d 858, 864 (8th Cir. 1980),\nciting Thornton v. Carter, 109 F.2d 316, 319-320 (8th Cir. 1940).\n\n\n                                          10\n\f     The Court of Appeals, in ruling against the Debtor on its motion for summary\njudgment on grounds of its alleged lack of notice of Artoc’s assignment, held:\n\n      At the very least, the notice [stamp on the invoices] should have raised\n      a question in the mind of Apex, causing it to inquire about the security\n      interest before setting off its account. Robert Parker's Truck & Trailer\n      Repair, Inc. v. Speer, 722 S.W.2d 45, 48 (Tex.App.1986), held that\n      notice under § 9.318 \"embraces those things that a reasonably diligent\n      inquiry and exercise of the means of information at hand would have\n      disclosed.\" If Apex was unsure about the significance of the stamped\n      notice, it had a duty to inquire before exercising any right it might\n      otherwise have had to set off. At least where millions of dollars are at\n      stake, as was the case here, a company acts unreasonably if it sets off a\n      debt to it from another transaction, after being given notice of another's\n      security interest in the amount due.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, at 1370. On remand the\nbankruptcy court noted that the Court of Appeals held that the Debtor failed to make\na reasonable inquiry of Artoc’s interest in the invoices offset, and the bankruptcy court\nruled that the Debtor was negligent as a matter of law under the law of the case\ndoctrine. The bankruptcy court concluded that the negligence barred the defense of\nestoppel under Texas law.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the discussion by the Court of Appeals in Artoc Bank\n& Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, quoted above, was dicta and not covered by\nthe law of the case doctrine. However, the discussion directly supported the Court’s\nruling against the Debtor’s claim that it lacked notice of the assignment. The\ndiscussion was part of the Court’s ruling, not dicta.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f       The Debtor also argues that the finding cannot control the question of the\nDebtor’s negligence as it relates to the estoppel defense because the Court of Appeals\nspecifically expressed no view as to the merits of the estoppel theory, leaving it for\ndevelopment on remand to the bankruptcy court. The Court held:\n\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n      Finally, Apex argues that even if Artoc gave sufficient notice of the\n      assignment, it is estopped to recover on the invoices since it knew Apex\n      was engaging in setoffs with Uni and took no action to stop this practice.\n      Neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the District Court reached this issue.\n       They did not determine what the law requires to establish the defense of\n      estoppel, nor did they find the facts to refute or support it. Therefore,\n      the issue is not properly before us. We leave it for development on\n      remand to the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n                                      IV.\n      We reverse and remand to the District Court. That Court is instructed\n      to vacate its judgment and remand the cause to the Bankruptcy Court\n      with instructions to enter judgment for Artoc, unless it determines that\n      Artoc is estopped to recover on the debt. As to the merits of the\n      estoppel theory, we express no view.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, at 1370. However, simply\nbecause the Court of Appeals left the estoppel issues to be developed in the\nbankruptcy court on remand and expressed no view on the theory, does not mean that\nissues decided in the appeal that might also pertain to estoppel issues left on remand\nare not subject to the law of the case doctrine. Such issues decided are subject to the\ndoctrine and become law of the case in the remanded proceeding. Bethea v. Levi\n\n                                          12\n\fStrauss & Co., 916 F.2d 453, 456-57 (8th Cir. 1990). The bankruptcy court correctly\napplied the law of the case doctrine. 6\n\n2. Debtor’s Failure To Establish Fact Issue On Any Element Of Its Estoppel\nDefense.\n\n      The Debtor argues that it established a fact issue on each element of its estoppel\ndefense. However, there exists no material fact issue regarding either the Debtor’s\nmotion for summary judgment or Artoc’s motion on the issue. All of the necessary\nuncontested material facts are in the record to support summary judgment in favor of\nArtoc on estoppel.\n\nApplicable Law Of Estoppel In General.\n\n      Texas law of estoppel applies. Under Texas law, the party asserting an\naffirmative defense of equitable estoppel must establish five elements:\n\n\n\n\n      6\n         Even if the finding of negligence of the Debtor was not controlled by the\nlaw of the case, it is clear that the bankruptcy court made its own independent\nfinding of the Debtor’s negligence supported by the record before the court. In its\nSeptember 1, 1999 Memorandum supporting its order for judgment, the bankruptcy\ncourt explained:\n\n      ...Further, the Debtor has submitted interrogatory answers in this case\n      stating that the Debtor never communicated with any “persons known\n      to have been acting on behalf of Artoc.”...\n      ....\n      The duty of inquiry element of the estoppel defense is only satisfied\n      when the inquiry is made directly to the party to be estopped....\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 22)\n\n                                          13\n\f      (1) that the adverse party made a false representation to the asserting\n      party or concealed a material fact from the asserting party;\n      (2) that the adverse party engaged in the misrepresentation or\n      concealment knowingly and intentionally;\n      (3) that the asserting party was without knowledge or the means to\n      determine the nature of the true facts. This element requires the asserting\n      party to demonstrate that it fulfilled its duty of inquiry, and that it acted\n      reasonably in its own conduct which is the subject of the dispute in\n      which the defense is asserted;\n      (4) that the adverse party intentionally induced the asserting party to\n      engage in the disputed conduct through misrepresentation or\n      concealment; and\n      (5) that the asserting party engaged in the conduct because it relied on the\n      adverse party’s misrepresentations or concealment to the Debtor’s\n      prejudice.\n\nTraylor v. Gray, 547 S.W.2d 644, 652 (Tex. Civ. App. 1977); Harris v. Varo, Inc.,\n814 S.W.2d 520, 522 (Tex. Civ. App. 1991); Norris of Houston. Inc. v. Gafas, 562\nS.W2d 894 (Tex. Civ. App. 1978); Fretz Construction Co. v. Southern Nat’l Bank of\nHouston, 600 S.W.2d 878, 881 (Tex. Ct. App. 1980). Failure to meet the duty of\ninquiry in a secured financing transaction is negligence, which bars an estoppel defense\nas a matter of law. Continental Credit Corp. v. Norman, 303 S.W.2d 449 (Tex. Civ.\nApp. 1957).\n\nNo Issues Of Material Fact.\n\n       The Debtor was the first to file a motion for summary judgment on the estoppel\nissue. In doing so, the Debtor itself represented that there existed no material question\nof fact regarding any of the five elements listed above that must be shown to\nsuccessfully assert the defense. Artoc’s motion on estoppel added nothing to the\n\n                                           14\n\fscope of the proceeding created by the Debtor’s own motion other than the argument\nof facts and conclusions articulated by the Court of Appeals from the summary\njudgment record before it in its 1992 decision, which Artoc argued controlled\ndetermination of the matter.\n\n      The Debtor claims that it established the following fact issues:\n\n      i.)     Artoc concealed a material fact, i.e., that it objected to the setoffs;\n      ii.)    Artoc had actual or constructive knowledge of the facts;\n      iii.)   the Debtor had no knowledge of an objection by Artoc;\n      iv.)    Artoc intended that its silence would be relied upon; and,\n      v.)     the Debtor acted in reliance on Artoc’s silence to its detriment.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       There is no evidence in the record that Artoc was aware of the Debtor’s\nintentions or actions in setting off the accounts before the setoffs occurred.7 We agree\nwith the bankruptcy court that the only evidence in the record on the issue is that Artoc\nwas not aware of the setoffs until after Uni filed bankruptcy, which was after the\nsetoffs occurred. Artoc could not object, or conceal an objection, to an action about\nto be taken by the Debtor of which Artoc was not aware.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n         The Debtor argues that Artoc had constructive knowledge because it knew\nthat other Uni customers were setting off against Uni invoices as early as March\n1980. The argument is not supported by the factual record in the proceeding. But,\neven if it was supported, knowledge of third party setoffs is not evidence of\nknowledge of the Debtor’s conduct.\n\n                                             15\n\f3. Bankruptcy Court’s Consideration Of Quasi-Estoppel And Related Defenses.\n\n      The Debtor argues:\n\n      The bankruptcy court’s summary rejection of the quasi-estoppel\n      concepts of ratification, acquiescence, acceptance of benefits,\n      unconscionability and contract was wrong as a matter of law.\n      Furthermore, it was clearly an abuse of discretion for the bankruptcy\n      court to deny Apex’s motion for leave to provide additional supporting\n      evidence on these various estoppel defenses and then summarily dismiss\n      the existence of such defenses based upon an alleged absence of\n      evidence in the record.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 23). However, each of these quasi-estoppel defenses, except that\nbased on contract, depends on timely knowledge of material facts by the party against\nwhom the defense is asserted.8 See, e.g., Teleprompter of Erie. Inc. v. City of Erie,\n567 F. Supp. 1277, 1282 (W.D. Pa. 1983) (“there can be no acquiescence where there\nis no knowledge”); Frazier v. Wynn, 472 S.W.2d 750, 753 (Tex. 1971), appeal after\nremand, 492 S.W.2d 54 (1973, error referred n.r.e.) (“there can be no estoppel from\nacceptance of the benefits by a person who did not have knowledge of all material\nfacts”) . We already determined that the summary judgment record amply supports\nthe bankruptcy court’s conclusion that Artoc was unaware of the Debtor’s setoffs\nuntil after Uni filed bankruptcy, which was after the setoffs occurred. Therefore, it\nfollows that Artoc did not have timely knowledge of the setoffs that otherwise might\nhave enabled a successful defense of knowledge-based estoppel. The bankruptcy\n\n\n      8\n        Estoppel by contract is based on contracts between the party raising the\ndefense and the party against whom estoppel is sought to be applied. Echols v.\nBloom, 485 S.W.2d 798, 801 (Tex. App. 1972). The Debtor had no contract with\nArtoc.\n\n                                         16\n\fcourt’s decision in this regard was not “wrong as a matter of law.” It was the correct\napplication of law to the uncontested core facts of the issue.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court’s failure to allow the Debtor leave\nto supplement the record with additional evidence on quasi-estoppel was an abuse of\ndiscretion. We again point out, however, that the Debtor alleged in its original motion\nfor summary judgment, filed on February 27, 1990, that “Artoc had actual notice that\nApex and other account debtors of Uni Refining were paying invoices directly to Uni\nand were engaging in the industry practice of ‘net-outs’, i.e. the set-off of mutual\nobligations.” (Appellant’s App. at 215). By the Debtor’s own motion, the Debtor\naffirmed that the necessary facts on the issue of Artoc’s knowledge of the setoffs were\nalready in the record as long ago as February 1990. It was not an abuse of discretion\nby the bankruptcy court to deny the Debtor’s request to supplement the factual record\nsix and nine years later before deciding the issue that the Debtor itself had earlier\nrepresented was ripe for summary judgment.\n\n4. Artoc’s Damages.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary\njudgment on damages for Artoc because a fact issue exists as to whether Artoc\nsuffered any damages. However, the directions of the Court of Appeals on remand\nwere clear and unambiguous in limiting the bankruptcy court on remand to consider\ndamages only in the context of prejudgment interest and attorney’s fees, which is what\nthe bankruptcy court did. The decision as originally filed on September 23, 1992,\ndirected:\n\n      We reverse and remand to the District Court. That Court is instructed\n      to vacate its judgment and remand the cause to the Bankruptcy Court\n      with instructions to enter judgment for Artoc, unless it determines that\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      Artoc is estopped to recover on the debt.        As to the merits of the\n      estoppel theory, we express no view.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, at 1370. On October 7, 1992, the\nDebtor petitioned the Court of Appeals for rehearing, arguing in its petition:\n\n      In its opinion, the Court has ruled that Apex could not properly offset the\n      invoices because prior to the offset it had notice of the assignment of the\n      accounts to Artoc. The Court, accordingly, has reversed the judgments\n      of the bankruptcy and district courts granting summary judgment on this\n      basis. However, should the Court disagree with Appellee that rehearing\n      should be granted on the offset issue, the Court should reverse and\n      remand \"for further proceedings\" rather than remanding with instructions\n      to enter judgment, because additional issues must be resolved before\n      entry of judgment for Artoc on its claim would be appropriate. See\n      Landry v. G.B.A., 762 F.2d 462, 464 (5th Cir. 1985) (denial of summary\n      judgment to one party does not constitute grant of judgment to the other\n      party).\n\n      In its opinion, the Court recognizes that Appellee’s estoppel defense\n      must be resolved prior to entry of judgment for Artoc. However,\n      Appellee has also raised other defenses which must be resolved by the\n      bankruptcy court prior to entering judgment for Artoc, such as waiver,\n      custom and usage of trade, and partial satisfaction of the accounts by\n      direct payments to Uni. In addition, pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code\n      and rules, once Appellee objected to and rebutted Artoc's claim, the\n      burden was on Artoc to prove its claim by a preponderance of the\n      evidence. In re West Tech. Ltd., 882 F.2d 323, 325 (8th Cir. 1989); In\n      re Allegheny International, Inc., 954 F.2d 167, 174 (3d Cir. 1992); In re\n      Fidelity Holding Co., 837 F.2d 696, 698 (5th Cir. 1988). Artoc has failed\n\n                                          18\n\fto do so on the record before the Court. Indeed, no evidentiary hearing\nhas been conducted at which Artoc could meet its burden. The\nrequirement that Artoc prove its claim is especially important in this case\nbecause there is a substantial dispute over the amount of Artoc's claim\nresulting from payments Apex made to Uni on the invoices in question\nand certain agreed credits on the invoices for matters such as product\nshortages.\n\nThe following factual issues must be determined in a trial on the objection\nto the proof of claim:\n1. the amount of the invoices as to which there were set-offs;\n2. whether Apex ever received one of the invoices on which Artoc seeks\nrecovery;\n3. the amount of the invoices that has been paid by Apex;\n4. whether any other valid claims, defenses or set-offs of Apex against\nUni or Artoc exist;\n5. the date upon which such other claims, defenses or set-offs accrued;\n6. whether the set-offs occurred as part of the contract between the\naccount debtor and the assignor;\n7. whether Artoc waived its rights; and\n8. the amount, if any, that Apex owes Artoc.\nSee In re Kolstad, 928 F.2d 171, 174 (5th Cir. 1991) (validity of\ncontested claim should be resolved by litigation in adversary proceeding).\n\nBy remanding this case to the bankruptcy court with instructions to enter\njudgment for Artoc (unless Artoc is estopped from recovering), the\nCourt is, in essence, granting summary judgment, sua sponte, for Artoc\non these additional issues, which this Court has repeatedly held to be\ninappropriate. E.g., Moore v. Warwick Public School District No. 29,\n794 F.2d 322, 325 (8th Cir. 1986); Williams v. City of St. Louis, 783\n\n                                    19\n\f      F.2d 114, 116 (8th Cir. 1986). Such a judgment is particularly improper\n      in a case such as this where the court is granting summary judgment for\n      a claimant on a claim which he has yet to prove. In order for a claimant\n      to be entitled to summary judgment, the claimant must establish each\n      essential element of his claim such that \"no reasonable trier of fact could\n      find other than for the [claimant].\"\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 551-552). The Court of Appeals was not persuaded.\n\n      In denying the petition for rehearing, the Court of Appeals ordered on\nNovember 19, 1992, that “The Court on its own motion modifies the directions\ncontained in the opinion previously filed by adding the following sentence at the end\nof the opinion: ‘If judgment is entered against Apex, the Bankruptcy Court should first\nconsider the issues of prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees. These issues are not\nconcluded by this opinion, and we express no view on their merits.’” (Appellant’s\nApp. at 537-538).\n\n       As we observed earlier, upon remand the trial court is restricted to the mandate\nof the remand, and is not free to “alter it, examine it except for purposes of execution,\nor give any further or other relief or review of it for apparent error with respect to any\nquestion decided on appeal.” Houghton v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 627 F.2d 858,\n864 (8th Cir. 1980), citing Thornton v. Carter, 109 F.2d 316, 319-320 (8th Cir. 1940).\nWe agree with the bankruptcy court that the mandate of the Court of Appeals on\nremand limited the trial court’s consideration of damages to interest and attorney’s\nfees to be awarded in addition to the amounts of the setoffs. The bankruptcy court\nproperly limited consideration of damages to that context.\n\n\n\n\n                                           20\n\fTwenty-Eight Percent Credit.\n\n      On November 9, 1999, the Debtor filed its motion in the bankruptcy court for\na 28% credit against Artoc’s claim as finally allowed by the court. The motion was\nbased on a provision in the confirmed Chapter 11 plan of Uni, entered in that case on\nAugust 15, 1983. The Debtor alleged that the following provision in Paragraph 5.2 of\nthe plan entitles the Debtor to the credit as an offset against Artoc’s claim in Apex’s\nbankruptcy.\n\n      5.2 Class VIII - Creditors against whom money damage judgments in\n      favor of Artoc Bank & Trust, Ltd. are awarded the District court Action\n      shall receive twenty-eight percent of their allowed claim as and when their\n      claim is filed or deemed filed, allowed and ordered paid by the Court.\n      This payment shall not be paid in cash to Class VIII Creditors, but shall\n      instead be received by those Class VIII Creditors whose claims are\n      allowed and ordered paid by the Court, in the form of a twenty-eight\n      percent (28%) credit against any judgment amount they are ever ordered\n      to pay to Artoc Bank and Trust, Ltd. in the District court Action.\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 276). The bankruptcy court denied the motion, ruling that the\nrequest was barred by the law of the case as being beyond scope of the remand; that\nthe relief requested was otherwise untimely raised as an affirmative defense; and, that\nthe motion lacked substantive merit. We agree with the bankruptcy court that the relief\nsought is barred by the law of the case, and was otherwise untimely sought. We\nexpress no view on substantive merits of the Debtor’s motion, as questions\nconcerning distributions under Uni’s confirmed plan are not properly before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fBeyond The Scope Of Remand.\n\n     The issue here is one of law only, and our standard of review is de novo.\nWhitmore v. Kenna, 213 F.3d 431, 432 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\n         In its appeal, the Debtor for the first time labels the request for credit as an\nestoppel defense, and argues that its pursuit is properly within the Court of Appeals\nmandate on remand of the proceeding back in 1992. However, the request, if it had\nbeen properly and timely asserted, would have been based on the defense of res\njudicata. See Land Services, Inc. v. Gaudet, 414 U.S. 573, 592 (1974). The Debtor\nand Artoc were creditors in the Uni bankruptcy case with competing interests. The\norder of confirmation was a final order in the case. Application of the order in a later\ncase or proceeding would be as res judicata. See Arnica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Moak, 55\nF.3d 1093, 1097 (5th Cir. 1995). For the reasons we discussed earlier pertaining to\nthe law of the case doctrine, we agree with the bankruptcy court that this newly raised\ndefense asserted by the Debtor in its November 9, 1999 motion was beyond the scope\nof the remand.\n\nOtherwise Untimely Raised As An Affirmative Defense.\n\n       Our review of the bankruptcy court’s denial of the Debtor’s motion for\napplication of the 28% credit, to the extent that the denial was based on general\nuntimeliness of the Debtor in asserting the defense, is under the abuse of discretion\nstandard. Comsat Corp. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., 246 F.3d 1101, 1105,\n(8th Cir. 2001).\n\n        We agree with the bankruptcy court that the defense was untimely raised even\nif it was not beyond the scope of the remand. Res judicata and collateral estoppel are\naffirmative defenses that must be affirmatively pled, or they are deemed waived. See\nSartin v. Comm'r of Public Safety, 535 F.2d 430, 433 (8th Cir. 1976). Fed. R. Bankr.\n\n                                           22\n\fP. 7008(c) requires that any matter \"constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense\"\nmust be pled in a responsive pleading. The Debtor did not plead the alleged credit\nagainst any judgment as an affirmative defense in any responsive pleading, and never\nraised it in any pleading until after the order for judgment allowing the principal amount\nof Artoc’s claim had been entered by the bankruptcy court.\n\n        The attempt to raise the defense for the first time three months after the\nbankruptcy court entered its order for summary judgment in favor of Artoc, seven\nyears after the Court of Appeals remanded the claim objection proceeding, and long\nafter its own objection to Artoc’s claim was filed, was untimely. The bankruptcy\ncourt’s denial of the motion under these circumstances was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nAttorneys Fees.\n\n       The bankruptcy court denied Artoc’s claim for attorneys’ fees to the extent the\nrequest was for postpetition fees. As to Artoc’s claim for prepetition, prejudgment\nattorneys’ fees, however, the court concluded that pursuant to the controlling Texas\nlaw, which state law the parties agreed governed the issue, Artoc is entitled to fees in\naddition to the principal amount of the claim because the claim was found to be both\nfor a sworn account (as assignee of a creditor, Uni, in a sale and purchase of personal\nproperty with the debtor, Apex) and for an oral or written contract (as assignee of the\nsale contracts between Uni and Apex), and because the prejudgment presentment\nrequirement was satisfied when Artoc made its demand of Apex in 1981. See Tex.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. § 38.001.\n\n       The court allowed Artoc’s principal claim in the amount of $1.7 million, plus\ninterest. In a subsequent, separate order and opinion determining the appropriate\namount of prepetition, prejudgment attorneys’ fees due Artoc, the court allowed fees\nin the amount of $1,761.850.00 as part of Artoc’s allowed general unsecured claim.\nOf the total amount of fees awarded, $316,850.00 represents hourly fees for services\n\n                                           23\n\fperformed by the law firm of Breed, Abbott, Morgan from 1981 to 1986, and\n$1,445,000.00 represents a contingent fee for services performed by Fehrenbacher,\nSale & Quinn, based on fifty percent of Artoc’s allowed principal and interest claim.\n\n      Apex raised numerous objections before the bankruptcy court, including: 1)\nArtoc failed to segregate fees expended in the prosecution of defendants other than\nApex; 2) Artoc’s documents in support of its request for fees were inadequate for\nwant of sufficient descriptions of services and time spent; 3) a contingent fee\nagreement was not permissible; 4) the contingent fees requested included postpetition\namounts; and 5) the contingent fees were not reasonable by comparison to the hourly\nfees requested and in relation to the amount of the allowed claim.\n\n       In its appeal of the bankruptcy court’s allowance of fees, Apex raises these and\nother issues, essentially contending that the court both erred as a matter of law in\nawarding the fees and abused its discretion in determining the reasonableness of the\nfees. With respect to the reasonableness, Apex argues that the matter was in need of\nan evidentiary hearing and not properly summarily determined. Apex challenges\nseveral of the court’s factual findings, including: 1) work performed in connection with\nclaims against Apex was common to claims against other account debtors such that\nthe work would have been performed even if Apex had been the sole account debtor,\nthat the claims of different defendants were inextricably intertwined, and that Artoc’s\nfees were all for work performed on or related to the claim against Apex; 2) all fees\nrequested were in fact prepetition; 3) there was no duplication of legal services; 4) the\ndocuments provided to support the request for fees were sufficient; and 5) the amount\nof the fee award was reasonable and necessary. Apex also contests the court’s legal\nconclusions, arguing that the court erred in its determination of the propriety of the\ncontingent fee and the purported lodestar adjustment of the contingency fee.\n\n\n\n\n                                           24\n\fStandard of Review\n\n        A decision regarding attorney fees is reviewable for an abuse of discretion. See\nWalton v. LaBarge (In re Clark), 223 F.3d 859, 862 (8th Cir. 2000). “The bankruptcy\ncourt has the broad power and discretion to award or deny attorney fees, and, indeed,\na duty to examine them for reasonableness.” Id. at 863 (citations omitted). “Whether\nthe compensation sought is reasonable, given the time, nature, extent of the services\nand the value of the services is always a question of fact for the court.” Id., citing\nChamberlain v. Kula (In re Kula), 213 B.R. 729, 735 (8th Cir. BAP 1997); see also\nStewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 12 (Tex. 1991); Gorman v.\nCountrywood Property Owners Assoc., 1 S.W.3d 915, 918 (Tex. App. 1999)\n(citations omitted).\n\n      Because the bankruptcy court is in the best position to determine the\nreasonableness of attorney’s fees, we will not disturb a bankruptcy court’s award of\nfees unless there has been an abuse of discretion. See Browning v. President\nRiverboat Casino-Missouri, Inc., 139 F.3d 631, 637-638 (8th Cir. 1998) (rejecting an\nappeal of a district court’s award of attorneys’ fees based on arguments that the award\nwas excessive and unreasonable due to lack of complexity, duplicative fees, and\nundocumented hours).\n\nThe Bankruptcy Court’s Factual Findings\n\n      “Although courts should consider several factors when awarding attorney’s\nfees, a short hand version of these considerations is that the trial court may award\nthose fees that are ‘reasonable and necessary’ for the prosecution of the suit.” See\nSterling, 822 S.W.2d at 10. The bankruptcy court’s opinion reflects careful\nconsideration of the many years of litigation including the nature and complexity of the\ndispute as well as the records kept by the lawyers providing Artoc’s representation.\nThere is no compelling evidence to suggest that the court did not carefully and\n\n                                          25\n\fthoroughly evaluate the prepetition services provided by Breed Abbott on an hourly\nbasis between 1981 and 1986 from the initial investigation and demand for payment on\nthe Apex setoffs and the prepetition contingent representation performed by the\nFehrenbacher firm thereafter. The record supports the court’s conclusion that both\nfirms provided extensive legal services involving complex legal issues and was entirely\nnecessary to the recovery on Artoc’s claim against Apex.\n\n      The court specifically found that time records were maintained\ncontemporaneously with the provision of services and that periodic summary\nstatements were also generated by the firms, and that the documentation of the legal\nwork performed was “as complete as reasonably possible.”\n\n       “When a plaintiff seeks to recover attorney’s fees in a case where there are\nmultiple defendants, and one or more defendants settle, the plaintiff must segregate the\nfees owed by the remaining defendants from those owed by the settling defendants,\nso that the remaining defendant is not charged fees for which it is not responsible.”\nSee Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 10-11; see also Aetna Casualty and Surety v. Wild, 944\nS.W.2d 37, 40 (Tex. App. 1997). Indeed, a failure to segregate fees may be fatal to\nrecovery of attorney fees. See Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 11. “However, segregation of\nattorney’s fees is not required where the services rendered relate to (1) multiple claims\narising out of the same facts or transaction and (2) the prosecution or defense entails\nproof or denial of essentially the same facts, so as to render the attorney’s fees\ninseparable.” See Wild, 944 S.W.2d at 41, citing Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 11-12; see\nalso Gorman, 1 S.W.3d at 918.\n\n      The bankruptcy court expressly found that the investigative work performed\nagainst all the defendants was so related and common that it would have been required\neven if Apex had been the sole defendant and that the legal services could not be\napportioned among defendants or to any single defendant. Indeed, the court\nacknowledged that some relatively minor facts differed from claim to claim, but\n\n                                           26\n\funequivocally concluded that “the legal issues presented and the defenses raised by\nthe defendants were substantially similar.” All of the court’s factual findings regarding\nthe nature and necessity and reasonableness of the legal services provided by both\nfirms are supported by numerous affidavits and cannot be said to be so contrary as\nto amount to a clear error in judgment. Its findings that the claims of different\ndefendants were inextricably intertwined and that there was no duplication of services\nare adequately manifest from the voluminous record and need not be disturbed by the\nsecond guess of a reviewing court.\n\nThe Fehrenbacher Contingent Fee Award\n\n       The larger issue looming in the Apex appeal is the overall propriety of the award\nof a contingent fee. Apex does not expressly disagree that Artoc’s case, upon no\nlonger being able to retain the hourly representation of Breed Abbott, involved\ncomplexity, uncertainty of success, and a need for expedited trial preparation. Apex\ndoes not, however, concede that a contingent fee of fifty percent to take on the project\nwas reasonable by virtue of those aggravating factors. Apex argues that the court\nerred not only in its factual determination of reasonableness of the contingent fee, but\nalso in essence that the court erred as a matter of law by allowing any contingent fee.\n\n       The bankruptcy court found that under Texas law a contingency fee is\npermissible, even at fifty percent assuming the controlling reasonableness\ndetermination is applied, and is properly included as part of a claim for attorney fees.\nWe agree. “The purpose of awarding attorney’s fees and taxing it against the losing\ndefendant is to make the successful plaintiff whole.” See Goodyear Tire and Rubber\nCo. v. Portilla, 836 S.W.2d 664, 672 (Tex. App. 1992). In a contingent fee case,\n“[t]he calculation to be used is to take the damages awarded to the plaintiff, with\ninterest, and then apply the reasonable percentage to it, in order to discover the amount\ndue the successful attorneys.” Id.\n\n\n                                           27\n\f       “Attorney contingency fee contracts serve two main purposes.” See Arthur\nAndersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997). “[T]hey\nallow plaintiffs who cannot afford to pay a lawyer up-front to pay the lawyer out of\nany recovery ... [and they] compensate the attorney for the risk that the attorney will\nreceive no fee whatsoever if the case is lost.” Id. (citation omitted). “The lawyer in\neffect lends the value of his services, which is secured by a share in the client’s\npotential recovery.” Id., citing Posner, Economic Analysis of Law § 21.9 (4th ed.\n1992).\n\n       “[A] contingent fee award based solely on evidence of a percentage fee\nagreement between a lawyer and a client may be determined without regard to many\nof the factors that should be considered when determining reasonableness.” See\nFirefighters’ and Police Officers’ Civil Serv. Comm’n. of the City of Houston v.\nHerrera, 981 S.W.2d 728, 735-736 (Tex. App. 1998), citing Arthur Andersen & Co.\nv. Perry Equipment Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997); see also Robertson\nCounty v. Wymola, 17 S.W.3d 334, 345 (Tex. App. 2000). A contingent fee\nagreement is admissible as to the reasonableness of fees, but the “agreement alone\ncannot support an award of attorney’s fees.” Id. The bankruptcy court did not rely\nmerely on the contingent fee agreement between Artoc and Fehrenbacher in allowing\nthe fee or in determining it a reasonable and necessary fee.\n\nReasonableness and Necessity of the Fees\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court in Arthur Andersen set forth a process for\ndetermining the reasonableness of attorney fees, including contingency fees. “Factors\nthat a factfinder should consider when determining the reasonableness of a fee include:\n(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,\nand the skill required to perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood ... that the\nacceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the\nlawyer; (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the\n\n                                             28\n\famount involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client\nor by the circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with\nthe client; (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers\nperforming the services ; and (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results\nobtained or uncertainty of collection before the legal services have been rendered.”\nSee Arthur Andersen, 945 S.W.2d at 818.\n\n       We uphold the bankruptcy court’s factual determination of the reasonableness\nof both the hourly fees and the fifty percent contingency fee. The court cited Arthur\nAndersen and thereunder plainly evaluated Artoc’s case against Apex and Artoc’s fee\nagreements with the Breed Abbott and Fehrenbacher firms with patent regard for the\nrequisite factors. The Texas Supreme Court made clear in Arthur Andersen that the\nanalysis is a case-by-case project in which the factfinder “must decide the question of\n[the reasonableness and necessity of] attorney’s fees specifically in light of the work\nperformed in the very case for which the fee is sought.” Id. at 819. The record\nindicates that the court examined with care and sense a sufficient presentation of\nevidence upon which it based its conclusion that the contingent fee was reasonable and\nnecessary.\n\nProportionality\n\n       Apex also argues that the fee award is improper because it is out of balance with\nthe amount of the allowed underlying claim. While the extent of apparent\nproportionality of a fee award to the substantive amount in controversy is a valid\nconsideration in the reasonableness determination, it is not alone a dispositive factor,\neven in a case of sizeable disparity as, for example, a fee award two and one half times\nthe amount of the underlying claim. See Gorman, 1 S.W.2d at 919. Again, it is\napparent that the bankruptcy court took into account the required and relevant\nconsiderations under Arthur Andersen in finding the fee award appropriate overall. Its\n\n\n                                          29\n\fproportional largesse alone is not enough to overcome the other factors consistently\nbehind the court’s conclusion.\n\nContingency Enhancement of the Lodestar\n\n      Finally, Apex argues that the bankruptcy court’s allowance of the Fehrenbacher\nfee constitutes error because it effectively amounts to enhancing a lodestar for a\ncontingency, and cites the Supreme Court’s opinion in City of Burlington v. Dague,\n505 U.S. 557, 565 (1992), for the proposition that such a procedure is impermissible.\n\n       Apex is correct that Dague holds that enhancement of a lodestar calculation for\ncontingency is not permitted, at least under federal fee-shifting statutes. However, the\nbankruptcy court did not enhance a lodestar calculation in awarding the contingent fees\nof the Fehrenbacher firm. Instead, the court analyzed the reasonableness and\nnecessity of an award of fees pursuant to the contingency agreement under the\napplicable state law and, having plausibly determined it sound, endorsed the award at\nthe contract rate.\n\n      “A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts in an unreasonable and arbitrary\nmanner or without reference to any guiding rules or principles. See Wymola, 17\nS.W.3d at 344, citing Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701 S.W.2d 238, 241-\n242 (Tex. 1985). The bankruptcy court exercised care in considering the lengthy and\ncomplex record on the issue of fees in this case. The factual findings are supported\nand the law relied upon is valid. The bankruptcy court made no error of law or\njudgment and did not abuse its discretion. The award of attorneys’ fees is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f                                    III\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n      Having found no abuse of discretion and no clear error of judgment or of law\nmade by the bankruptcy court in any of the four orders from which the Debtor\nappeals, the decisions and judgment therewith are affirmed.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL,\n                     EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n\n\n                                       31\n\f",

O’Brien, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the\nDistrict of Minnesota, sitting by designation.\n\f       Apex Oil Company (the “Debtor”) appeals from four bankruptcy court2 orders\nand a summary judgment entered in favor of Artoc Bank & Trust Limited (“Artoc”),\nallowing Artoc a claim in the Debtor’s bankruptcy case in the amount of $3,461,850. 3\nWe affirm.\n\n\n                                     I\n                           STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n       During the 1970's, Artoc was a secured lender to Uni Refining, Inc. (“Uni”).\nArtoc held an assignment of Uni’s accounts receivable and a security interest in Uni’s\ninventory. Notice of the assignment was placed on Uni’s invoices to its customers\nalong with instructions for them to send invoice payments to Artoc. In the course of\ntheir relationship, Uni encountered financial difficulties which caused it to file\nbankruptcy in February 1981. The Debtor was both a customer and vendor of Uni.\nShortly before Uni filed bankruptcy, the Debtor offset against two invoices it had\nreceived from Uni, amounts owing by Uni to the Debtor. The first offset occurred on\nDecember 18, 1980 in the amount of $ 390,648.44, and the second on December 31,\n1980, in the amount of $1,334,182.81.\n\n       After Uni’s bankruptcy, Artoc sued the Debtor and others in a Texas federal\ndistrict court alleging that the offsets were in violation of its rights as assignee of Uni’s\nreceivables. During the course of that litigation, the Debtor filed this Chapter 11\nbankruptcy case in December 1987. Artoc filed a proof of claim in the case based on\nthe alleged wrongful offsets, and the Debtor objected to the claim. The Debtor\nsubsequently filed a motion for summary judgment on the objection, based on alleged\n\n       2\n        The Honorable James J. Barta, United States Bankruptcy Judge for the\nEastern District of Missouri.\n       3\n          $1,700,000 of this amount represents principal to which 10% prepetition\ninterest is to be added. The remaining $1,761,850 is allowed attorneys’ fees.\n\n                                             2\n\flack of notice to the Debtor of the assignment and estoppel. In 1991, the bankruptcy\ncourt ruled in the Debtor’s favor on the notice issue, without deciding the estoppel\nissue. The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court also without considering the\nestoppel issue.\n\n       In September 1992, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district\ncourt and ruled for Artoc on the notice issue. The Court of Appeals declined to\naddress the merits of the Debtor’s summary judgment motion on the issue of estoppel,\nsaying only that it expressed no opinion on the matter. The Court remanded the\nproceeding to the district court with instructions that it remand to the bankruptcy court\nfor entry of judgment in favor of Artoc unless the Debtor prevailed on the estoppel\nissue. On petition for rehearing, the Court later added the following instruction:\n\n      If judgment is entered against Apex, the Bankruptcy Court should first\n      consider the issues of prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees. These\n      issues are not concluded by this opinion, and we express no view on\n      their merits.\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 537-38).\n\n       Artoc filed its motion for summary judgment on all issues, including the\nDebtor’s estoppel defense, in March 1993 in the remanded proceeding. The Debtor\nresponded with a cross-motion for partial summary judgment on the issues of interest\nand attorneys’ fees, and the Debtor initiated discovery relating to all issues, including\nits estoppel defense. Artoc opposed any discovery relating to estoppel, but the\nbankruptcy court granted the Debtor’s motion to compel discovery in April 1993.\nArtoc then moved for leave to appeal the bankruptcy court’s discovery order and, in\nNovember 1993, the bankruptcy court stayed all further proceedings while that appeal\nremained pending in the district court. In the meantime, Artoc filed a petition in the\ndistrict court on June 29, 1993 for removal of the bankruptcy case to the district court\n\n                                           3\n\fbased on bankruptcy judge’s alleged bias and prejudice against Artoc. In April 1995,\nthe district court denied Artoc’s motion for leave to appeal the bankruptcy court’s\nApril 1993 discovery order, but directed the bankruptcy judge to disqualify himself\nfrom the proceeding. 4\n\n       In October 1996, the bankruptcy court, Judge James Barta, held a status\nconference in the proceeding. The Debtor had filed a motion to supplement the record\nwith additional facts on the issue of estoppel. The bankruptcy court encouraged the\nparties to supplement their earlier briefs with updated case law, provided Artoc an\nopportunity to respond to the Debtor’s request to present new facts on the estoppel\ndefense, and indicated that he would thereafter issue a written order deciding the\nrequest and memorializing other procedural matters dealt with in the status conference.\nArtoc filed its response in opposition to the Debtor’s request to present additional\nfacts on the estoppel issue on October 28, 1996. No further order was issued by the\nbankruptcy court regarding the proceeding, however, until September 1, 1999 when\nJudge Barta entered his Order denying Apex’s Motion for Summary Judgment and\ngranting Artoc’s Motion for Summary Judgment.\n\n      The Debtor filed its Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment on September 13,\n1999, whereby the Debtor: sought vacation of the judgment and leave to present\nadditional facts on its estoppel defense; argued that Artoc had failed to establish that\nit had sustained damages; argued that the court had erred in providing for calculation\n\n\n      4\n          The bankruptcy judge disclosed to the parties that he had earlier\nrepresented Apex in connection with the subject matter of the disputed claim and\nthe district court agreed with the recommendation of a magistrate that the judge be\ndisqualified because his impartiality might reasonably be questioned as a result.\nThe district court ruled that no actual bias or prejudice had been shown. The court\ndetermined that the proceeding should be reassigned to another bankruptcy judge\nunder the circumstances, rather than be removed to the district court. (Appellant’s\nApp. at 108-09).\n\n                                           4\n\fof prejudgment interest by compounding it daily; and, argued that “The action of the\nEighth Circuit in sua sponte granting judgment for Artoc deprived Apex of its right to\na hearing - if not a trial - on the other defenses that it had pleaded when it moved for\nsummary judgment in 1990.” (Appellant’s App. at 270-72). By separate motion filed\non November 9, 1999, the Debtor for the first time requested 28% credit against the\namount of Artoc’s claim as otherwise finally allowed.\n\n       On December 18, 2000, the bankruptcy court issued three separate orders: one,\ndenying the Debtor’s motion to alter or amend the judgment and to allow the Debtor\nto present additional facts on the issue of estoppel, but amending the judgment to\nallow only simple interest on prepetition attorneys fees; a second, denying the\nDebtor’s motion for 28% credit against Artoc’s claim; and the third, determining and\nallowing the amount of Artoc’s attorneys fees as part of its allowed proof of claim.\nThe Debtor appeals from the court’s September 1, 1999 order and judgment, and\nfrom the three December 18, 2000 orders.\n\n                                          II\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\nSupplementing The Factual Summary Judgment Record On Estoppel.\n\n      We review the bankruptcy court’s denial of the Debtor’s motion to supplement\nthe factual summary judgment record on estoppel under the abuse of discretion\nstandard.

The motion was based on the\nDebtor’s alleged lack of notice of Artoc’s assignment of the accounts that it had offset\nagainst, and based on the defense of estoppel. Regarding estoppel, the motion pled:\n\n                ARTOC’S CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY ESTOPPEL\n\n      The summary judgment evidence shows that, as a matter of law, Artoc\n      had actual notice that Apex and other account debtors of Uni Refining\n      were paying invoices directly to Uni and were engaging in the industry\n      practice of “net-outs”, i.e. the set-off of mutual obligations. The\n      summary judgment evidence also shows as a matter of law that Artoc\n      Bank did not object to the direct payments and set-offs and took no\n      action to stop them.\n\n      As a matter of law, Artoc is estopped to contend that Apex should not\n      have set-off its invoices against amounts it owed to Uni.\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 215-16). In remanding the proceeding in September 1992, the\nCourt of Appeals held:\n\n                                          III.\n\n                                           6\n\f      Finally, Apex argues that even if Artoc gave sufficient notice of the\n      assignment, it is estopped to recover on the invoices since it knew Apex\n      was engaging in setoffs with Uni and took no action to stop this practice.\n      Neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the District Court reached this issue.\n      They did not determine what the law requires to establish the defense of\n      estoppel, nor did they find the facts to refute or support it. Therefore,\n      the issue is not properly before us. We leave it for development on\n      remand to the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n                                        IV.\n      We reverse and remand to the District Court. That Court is instructed\n      to vacate its judgment and remand the cause to the Bankruptcy Court\n      with instructions to enter judgment for Artoc, unless it determines that\n      Artoc is estopped to recover on the debt.

The Debtor argues in its\nbrief filed in this appeal:\n\n      The bankruptcy court abused its discretion by denying Apex the\n      opportunity to supplement its opposition to Artoc’s Motion for\n      Summary Judgment. (App. at 339). By denying Apex’s request for leave\n      to supplement, the bankruptcy court effectively prevented Apex from\n      presenting additional facts and raising additional bases for its estoppel\n      argument. (App. at 72-73; 270). Those facts would buttress Apex’s\n      claim that Artoc was barred by quasi-estoppel from collecting on its\n      claim...\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 6). The Debtor argues on that:\n\n      ...Apex filed its original Motion for Summary Judgment in this matter on\n      February 27, 1990. (App. at 210-68). In that motion, Apex asserted that\n      it was entitled to summary judgment for two reasons: (1) because it did\n      not get proper notice of Uni’s assignment to Artoc; and (2) because\n      Artoc was estopped from pursuing its claims. (App at 214-16). Under\n      Texas law, [] the defense of estoppel includes the doctrines of\n      quasi-estoppel, as well as equitable estoppel.[]\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 6-7). Apparently, the Debtor acknowledges that these defenses\nwere included in the Debtor’s 1990 motion for summary judgment on estoppel and,\nit seems by necessary inference, that no material issues of fact pertained to any of\nthem when the Debtor filed the motion.\n\n\n                                          8\n\f      The Debtor references its request to supplement the factual record as a motion\nunder Fed.R.Bankr.P. 7056 to supplement its response to Artoc’s motion for\nsummary judgment. However, Artoc’s motion was simply a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment on the issue of estoppel that was pending in the Debtor’s own\nmotion for summary judgment. The only thing added by Artoc’s motion to the\nDebtor’s then pending motion was discussion of facts articulated from the record\nbefore it by the Court of Appeals that Artoc believed controlled determination of the\nmatter.\n\n      The Debtor has pointed to nothing in Rule 7056 that would tend to support,\nmuch less compel, the granting of the motion to supplement under these\ncircumstances. Furthermore, supplementing the record with additional facts would\nhave been futile anyway because, as discussed later, the defense of estoppel on any\nof the Debtor’s theories is barred by uncontested facts that are core to all theories of\nestoppel.\n\n      The Debtor was not entitled to supplement the factual record long since closed\nby the Debtor’s own pending motion, and the bankruptcy court’s failure to grant the\nDebtor’s motion to supplement its response to Artoc’s motion for summary judgment\nby addition of facts relating to estoppel was not an abuse of discretion. 5\n\n\n\n\n      5\n         Apparently, the bankruptcy judge thought that he had granted the Debtor’s\nrequest during the October 17, 1996 status conference, as he discussed in his\nDecember 18, 2000 order denying the Debtor’s motion to alter or amend.\nHowever, review of the transcript of the hearing shows that the judge had intended\nto rule on the motion in a written order after Artoc responded to it, which Artoc did\non October 28, 1996.\n\n                                           9\n\fSummary Judgment For Artoc Was Proper.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary\njudgment for Artoc for the following reasons: 1) the bankruptcy court misapplied the\nlaw of the case doctrine; 2) the Debtor established a fact issue on each element of its\nestoppel defense; 3) the bankruptcy court disregarded the Debtor’s quasi-estoppel and\nrelated defenses; and, 4) Artoc suffered no damages due to the setoffs taken by the\nDebtor.\n\n       We review the bankruptcy court’s grant of summary judgment to Artoc de\nnovo.

Application Of Law Of The Case Doctrine.\n\n      The law of the case doctrine applied by the Eighth Circuit, is:\n\n      When a case has been decided by this court on appeal and remanded to\n      the District Court, every question which was before the court and\n      disposed of by its decree is finally settled and determined. The District\n      Court is bound by the decree and must carry it into execution according\n      to the mandate. It cannot alter it, examine it except for purposes of\n      execution, or give any further or other relief or review of it for apparent\n      error with respect to any question decided on appeal.\n\nHoughton v.

Robert Parker's Truck & Trailer\n      Repair, Inc. v. Speer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2362349\"><a href=\"/opinion/2362349/robert-parkers-truck-trailer-inc-v-speer/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (Tex.App.1986), held that\n      notice under § 9.318 \"embraces those things that a reasonably diligent\n      inquiry and exercise of the means of information at hand would have\n      disclosed.\" If Apex was unsure about the significance of the stamped\n      notice, it had a duty to inquire before exercising any right it might\n      otherwise have had to set off. At least where millions of dollars are at\n      stake, as was the case here, a company acts unreasonably if it sets off a\n      debt to it from another transaction, after being given notice of another's\n      security interest in the amount due.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, at 1370. On remand the\nbankruptcy court noted that the Court of Appeals held that the Debtor failed to make\na reasonable inquiry of Artoc’s interest in the invoices offset, and the bankruptcy court\nruled that the Debtor was negligent as a matter of law under the law of the case\ndoctrine. The bankruptcy court concluded that the negligence barred the defense of\nestoppel under Texas law.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the discussion by the Court of Appeals in Artoc Bank\n& Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, quoted above, was dicta and not covered by\nthe law of the case doctrine. However, the discussion directly supported the Court’s\nruling against the Debtor’s claim that it lacked notice of the assignment. The\ndiscussion was part of the Court’s ruling, not dicta.\n\n\n\n\n                                           11\n\f       The Debtor also argues that the finding cannot control the question of the\nDebtor’s negligence as it relates to the estoppel defense because the Court of Appeals\nspecifically expressed no view as to the merits of the estoppel theory, leaving it for\ndevelopment on remand to the bankruptcy court. The Court held:\n\n\n\n\n                                       III.\n      Finally, Apex argues that even if Artoc gave sufficient notice of the\n      assignment, it is estopped to recover on the invoices since it knew Apex\n      was engaging in setoffs with Uni and took no action to stop this practice.\n      Neither the Bankruptcy Court nor the District Court reached this issue.\n       They did not determine what the law requires to establish the defense of\n      estoppel, nor did they find the facts to refute or support it. Therefore,\n      the issue is not properly before us. We leave it for development on\n      remand to the Bankruptcy Court.\n\n                                      IV.\n      We reverse and remand to the District Court. That Court is instructed\n      to vacate its judgment and remand the cause to the Bankruptcy Court\n      with instructions to enter judgment for Artoc, unless it determines that\n      Artoc is estopped to recover on the debt. As to the merits of the\n      estoppel theory, we express no view.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, at 1370. However, simply\nbecause the Court of Appeals left the estoppel issues to be developed in the\nbankruptcy court on remand and expressed no view on the theory, does not mean that\nissues decided in the appeal that might also pertain to estoppel issues left on remand\nare not subject to the law of the case doctrine. Such issues decided are subject to the\ndoctrine and become law of the case in the remanded proceeding. Bethea v.

The bankruptcy court correctly\napplied the law of the case doctrine. 6\n\n2. Debtor’s Failure To Establish Fact Issue On Any Element Of Its Estoppel\nDefense.\n\n      The Debtor argues that it established a fact issue on each element of its estoppel\ndefense. However, there exists no material fact issue regarding either the Debtor’s\nmotion for summary judgment or Artoc’s motion on the issue. All of the necessary\nuncontested material facts are in the record to support summary judgment in favor of\nArtoc on estoppel.\n\nApplicable Law Of Estoppel In General.\n\n      Texas law of estoppel applies. Under Texas law, the party asserting an\naffirmative defense of equitable estoppel must establish five elements:\n\n\n\n\n      6\n         Even if the finding of negligence of the Debtor was not controlled by the\nlaw of the case, it is clear that the bankruptcy court made its own independent\nfinding of the Debtor’s negligence supported by the record before the court. In its\nSeptember 1, 1999 Memorandum supporting its order for judgment, the bankruptcy\ncourt explained:\n\n      ...Further, the Debtor has submitted interrogatory answers in this case\n      stating that the Debtor never communicated with any “persons known\n      to have been acting on behalf of Artoc.”...\n      ....\n      The duty of inquiry element of the estoppel defense is only satisfied\n      when the inquiry is made directly to the party to be estopped....\n\n(Appellant’s App. at 22)\n\n                                          13\n\f      (1) that the adverse party made a false representation to the asserting\n      party or concealed a material fact from the asserting party;\n      (2) that the adverse party engaged in the misrepresentation or\n      concealment knowingly and intentionally;\n      (3) that the asserting party was without knowledge or the means to\n      determine the nature of the true facts. This element requires the asserting\n      party to demonstrate that it fulfilled its duty of inquiry, and that it acted\n      reasonably in its own conduct which is the subject of the dispute in\n      which the defense is asserted;\n      (4) that the adverse party intentionally induced the asserting party to\n      engage in the disputed conduct through misrepresentation or\n      concealment; and\n      (5) that the asserting party engaged in the conduct because it relied on the\n      adverse party’s misrepresentations or concealment to the Debtor’s\n      prejudice.\n\nTraylor v.

Civ.\nApp. 1957).\n\nNo Issues Of Material Fact.\n\n       The Debtor was the first to file a motion for summary judgment on the estoppel\nissue. In doing so, the Debtor itself represented that there existed no material question\nof fact regarding any of the five elements listed above that must be shown to\nsuccessfully assert the defense. Artoc’s motion on estoppel added nothing to the\n\n                                           14\n\fscope of the proceeding created by the Debtor’s own motion other than the argument\nof facts and conclusions articulated by the Court of Appeals from the summary\njudgment record before it in its 1992 decision, which Artoc argued controlled\ndetermination of the matter.\n\n      The Debtor claims that it established the following fact issues:\n\n      i.)     Artoc concealed a material fact, i.e., that it objected to the setoffs;\n      ii.)    Artoc had actual or constructive knowledge of the facts;\n      iii.)   the Debtor had no knowledge of an objection by Artoc;\n      iv.)    Artoc intended that its silence would be relied upon; and,\n      v.)     the Debtor acted in reliance on Artoc’s silence to its detriment.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n       There is no evidence in the record that Artoc was aware of the Debtor’s\nintentions or actions in setting off the accounts before the setoffs occurred.7 We agree\nwith the bankruptcy court that the only evidence in the record on the issue is that Artoc\nwas not aware of the setoffs until after Uni filed bankruptcy, which was after the\nsetoffs occurred. Artoc could not object, or conceal an objection, to an action about\nto be taken by the Debtor of which Artoc was not aware.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n         The Debtor argues that Artoc had constructive knowledge because it knew\nthat other Uni customers were setting off against Uni invoices as early as March\n1980. The argument is not supported by the factual record in the proceeding. But,\neven if it was supported, knowledge of third party setoffs is not evidence of\nknowledge of the Debtor’s conduct.\n\n                                             15\n\f3. Bankruptcy Court’s Consideration Of Quasi-Estoppel And Related Defenses.\n\n      The Debtor argues:\n\n      The bankruptcy court’s summary rejection of the quasi-estoppel\n      concepts of ratification, acquiescence, acceptance of benefits,\n      unconscionability and contract was wrong as a matter of law.\n      Furthermore, it was clearly an abuse of discretion for the bankruptcy\n      court to deny Apex’s motion for leave to provide additional supporting\n      evidence on these various estoppel defenses and then summarily dismiss\n      the existence of such defenses based upon an alleged absence of\n      evidence in the record.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief at 23). However, each of these quasi-estoppel defenses, except that\nbased on contract, depends on timely knowledge of material facts by the party against\nwhom the defense is asserted.8 See, e.g., Teleprompter of Erie.

(“there can be no estoppel from\nacceptance of the benefits by a person who did not have knowledge of all material\nfacts”) . We already determined that the summary judgment record amply supports\nthe bankruptcy court’s conclusion that Artoc was unaware of the Debtor’s setoffs\nuntil after Uni filed bankruptcy, which was after the setoffs occurred. Therefore, it\nfollows that Artoc did not have timely knowledge of the setoffs that otherwise might\nhave enabled a successful defense of knowledge-based estoppel. The bankruptcy\n\n\n      8\n        Estoppel by contract is based on contracts between the party raising the\ndefense and the party against whom estoppel is sought to be applied. Echols v.\nBloom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2379614\"><a href=\"/opinion/2379614/echols-v-bloom/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 801 (Tex. App. 1972). The Debtor had no contract with\nArtoc.\n\n                                         16\n\fcourt’s decision in this regard was not “wrong as a matter of law.” It was the correct\napplication of law to the uncontested core facts of the issue.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court’s failure to allow the Debtor leave\nto supplement the record with additional evidence on quasi-estoppel was an abuse of\ndiscretion. We again point out, however, that the Debtor alleged in its original motion\nfor summary judgment, filed on February 27, 1990, that “Artoc had actual notice that\nApex and other account debtors of Uni Refining were paying invoices directly to Uni\nand were engaging in the industry practice of ‘net-outs’, i.e. the set-off of mutual\nobligations.” (Appellant’s App. at 215). By the Debtor’s own motion, the Debtor\naffirmed that the necessary facts on the issue of Artoc’s knowledge of the setoffs were\nalready in the record as long ago as February 1990. It was not an abuse of discretion\nby the bankruptcy court to deny the Debtor’s request to supplement the factual record\nsix and nine years later before deciding the issue that the Debtor itself had earlier\nrepresented was ripe for summary judgment.\n\n4. Artoc’s Damages.\n\n      The Debtor argues that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary\njudgment on damages for Artoc because a fact issue exists as to whether Artoc\nsuffered any damages. However, the directions of the Court of Appeals on remand\nwere clear and unambiguous in limiting the bankruptcy court on remand to consider\ndamages only in the context of prejudgment interest and attorney’s fees, which is what\nthe bankruptcy court did. The decision as originally filed on September 23, 1992,\ndirected:\n\n      We reverse and remand to the District Court. That Court is instructed\n      to vacate its judgment and remand the cause to the Bankruptcy Court\n      with instructions to enter judgment for Artoc, unless it determines that\n\n\n                                          17\n\f      Artoc is estopped to recover on the debt.        As to the merits of the\n      estoppel theory, we express no view.\n\nArtoc Bank & Trust Limited v. Apex Oil Company, at 1370. On October 7, 1992, the\nDebtor petitioned the Court of Appeals for rehearing, arguing in its petition:\n\n      In its opinion, the Court has ruled that Apex could not properly offset the\n      invoices because prior to the offset it had notice of the assignment of the\n      accounts to Artoc. The Court, accordingly, has reversed the judgments\n      of the bankruptcy and district courts granting summary judgment on this\n      basis. However, should the Court disagree with Appellee that rehearing\n      should be granted on the offset issue, the Court should reverse and\n      remand \"for further proceedings\" rather than remanding with instructions\n      to enter judgment, because additional issues must be resolved before\n      entry of judgment for Artoc on its claim would be appropriate.

However,\n      Appellee has also raised other defenses which must be resolved by the\n      bankruptcy court prior to entering judgment for Artoc, such as waiver,\n      custom and usage of trade, and partial satisfaction of the accounts by\n      direct payments to Uni.

The motion was\nbased on a provision in the confirmed Chapter 11 plan of Uni, entered in that case on\nAugust 15, 1983.

The bankruptcy court denied the motion, ruling that the\nrequest was barred by the law of the case as being beyond scope of the remand; that\nthe relief requested was otherwise untimely raised as an affirmative defense; and, that\nthe motion lacked substantive merit. We agree with the bankruptcy court that the relief\nsought is barred by the law of the case, and was otherwise untimely sought. We\nexpress no view on substantive merits of the Debtor’s motion, as questions\nconcerning distributions under Uni’s confirmed plan are not properly before us.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fBeyond The Scope Of Remand.\n\n     The issue here is one of law only, and our standard of review is de novo.\nWhitmore v.

The Debtor did not plead the alleged credit\nagainst any judgment as an affirmative defense in any responsive pleading, and never\nraised it in any pleading until after the order for judgment allowing the principal amount\nof Artoc’s claim had been entered by the bankruptcy court.\n\n        The attempt to raise the defense for the first time three months after the\nbankruptcy court entered its order for summary judgment in favor of Artoc, seven\nyears after the Court of Appeals remanded the claim objection proceeding, and long\nafter its own objection to Artoc’s claim was filed, was untimely. The bankruptcy\ncourt’s denial of the motion under these circumstances was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nAttorneys Fees.\n\n       The bankruptcy court denied Artoc’s claim for attorneys’ fees to the extent the\nrequest was for postpetition fees. As to Artoc’s claim for prepetition, prejudgment\nattorneys’ fees, however, the court concluded that pursuant to the controlling Texas\nlaw, which state law the parties agreed governed the issue, Artoc is entitled to fees in\naddition to the principal amount of the claim because the claim was found to be both\nfor a sworn account (as assignee of a creditor, Uni, in a sale and purchase of personal\nproperty with the debtor, Apex) and for an oral or written contract (as assignee of the\nsale contracts between Uni and Apex), and because the prejudgment presentment\nrequirement was satisfied when Artoc made its demand of Apex in 1981. See Tex.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. § 38.001.\n\n       The court allowed Artoc’s principal claim in the amount of $1.7 million, plus\ninterest. In a subsequent, separate order and opinion determining the appropriate\namount of prepetition, prejudgment attorneys’ fees due Artoc, the court allowed fees\nin the amount of $1,761.850.00 as part of Artoc’s allowed general unsecured claim.\nOf the total amount of fees awarded, $316,850.00 represents hourly fees for services\n\n                                           23\n\fperformed by the law firm of Breed, Abbott, Morgan from 1981 to 1986, and\n$1,445,000.00 represents a contingent fee for services performed by Fehrenbacher,\nSale & Quinn, based on fifty percent of Artoc’s allowed principal and interest claim.\n\n      Apex raised numerous objections before the bankruptcy court, including: 1)\nArtoc failed to segregate fees expended in the prosecution of defendants other than\nApex; 2) Artoc’s documents in support of its request for fees were inadequate for\nwant of sufficient descriptions of services and time spent; 3) a contingent fee\nagreement was not permissible; 4) the contingent fees requested included postpetition\namounts; and 5) the contingent fees were not reasonable by comparison to the hourly\nfees requested and in relation to the amount of the allowed claim.\n\n       In its appeal of the bankruptcy court’s allowance of fees, Apex raises these and\nother issues, essentially contending that the court both erred as a matter of law in\nawarding the fees and abused its discretion in determining the reasonableness of the\nfees. With respect to the reasonableness, Apex argues that the matter was in need of\nan evidentiary hearing and not properly summarily determined. Apex challenges\nseveral of the court’s factual findings, including: 1) work performed in connection with\nclaims against Apex was common to claims against other account debtors such that\nthe work would have been performed even if Apex had been the sole account debtor,\nthat the claims of different defendants were inextricably intertwined, and that Artoc’s\nfees were all for work performed on or related to the claim against Apex; 2) all fees\nrequested were in fact prepetition; 3) there was no duplication of legal services; 4) the\ndocuments provided to support the request for fees were sufficient; and 5) the amount\nof the fee award was reasonable and necessary. Apex also contests the court’s legal\nconclusions, arguing that the court erred in its determination of the propriety of the\ncontingent fee and the purported lodestar adjustment of the contingency fee.\n\n\n\n\n                                           24\n\fStandard of Review\n\n        A decision regarding attorney fees is reviewable for an abuse of discretion.

The bankruptcy court’s opinion reflects careful\nconsideration of the many years of litigation including the nature and complexity of the\ndispute as well as the records kept by the lawyers providing Artoc’s representation.\nThere is no compelling evidence to suggest that the court did not carefully and\n\n                                          25\n\fthoroughly evaluate the prepetition services provided by Breed Abbott on an hourly\nbasis between 1981 and 1986 from the initial investigation and demand for payment on\nthe Apex setoffs and the prepetition contingent representation performed by the\nFehrenbacher firm thereafter. The record supports the court’s conclusion that both\nfirms provided extensive legal services involving complex legal issues and was entirely\nnecessary to the recovery on Artoc’s claim against Apex.\n\n      The court specifically found that time records were maintained\ncontemporaneously with the provision of services and that periodic summary\nstatements were also generated by the firms, and that the documentation of the legal\nwork performed was “as complete as reasonably possible.”\n\n       “When a plaintiff seeks to recover attorney’s fees in a case where there are\nmultiple defendants, and one or more defendants settle, the plaintiff must segregate the\nfees owed by the remaining defendants from those owed by the settling defendants,\nso that the remaining defendant is not charged fees for which it is not responsible.”\nSee Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 10-11; see also Aetna Casualty and Surety v. Wild, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2441016\"><a href=\"/opinion/2441016/aetna-cas-sur-v-wild/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (Tex. App. 1997). Indeed, a failure to segregate fees may be fatal to\nrecovery of attorney fees. See Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 11. “However, segregation of\nattorney’s fees is not required where the services rendered relate to (1) multiple claims\narising out of the same facts or transaction and (2) the prosecution or defense entails\nproof or denial of essentially the same facts, so as to render the attorney’s fees\ninseparable.” See Wild, 944 S.W.2d at 41, citing Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 11-12; see\nalso Gorman, 1 S.W.3d at 918.\n\n      The bankruptcy court expressly found that the investigative work performed\nagainst all the defendants was so related and common that it would have been required\neven if Apex had been the sole defendant and that the legal services could not be\napportioned among defendants or to any single defendant. Indeed, the court\nacknowledged that some relatively minor facts differed from claim to claim, but\n\n                                           26\n\funequivocally concluded that “the legal issues presented and the defenses raised by\nthe defendants were substantially similar.” All of the court’s factual findings regarding\nthe nature and necessity and reasonableness of the legal services provided by both\nfirms are supported by numerous affidavits and cannot be said to be so contrary as\nto amount to a clear error in judgment. Its findings that the claims of different\ndefendants were inextricably intertwined and that there was no duplication of services\nare adequately manifest from the voluminous record and need not be disturbed by the\nsecond guess of a reviewing court.\n\nThe Fehrenbacher Contingent Fee Award\n\n       The larger issue looming in the Apex appeal is the overall propriety of the award\nof a contingent fee. Apex does not expressly disagree that Artoc’s case, upon no\nlonger being able to retain the hourly representation of Breed Abbott, involved\ncomplexity, uncertainty of success, and a need for expedited trial preparation. Apex\ndoes not, however, concede that a contingent fee of fifty percent to take on the project\nwas reasonable by virtue of those aggravating factors. Apex argues that the court\nerred not only in its factual determination of reasonableness of the contingent fee, but\nalso in essence that the court erred as a matter of law by allowing any contingent fee.\n\n       The bankruptcy court found that under Texas law a contingency fee is\npermissible, even at fifty percent assuming the controlling reasonableness\ndetermination is applied, and is properly included as part of a claim for attorney fees.\nWe agree. “The purpose of awarding attorney’s fees and taxing it against the losing\ndefendant is to make the successful plaintiff whole.” See Goodyear Tire and Rubber\nCo. v.

The bankruptcy court did not rely\nmerely on the contingent fee agreement between Artoc and Fehrenbacher in allowing\nthe fee or in determining it a reasonable and necessary fee.\n\nReasonableness and Necessity of the Fees\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court in Arthur Andersen set forth a process for\ndetermining the reasonableness of attorney fees, including contingency fees. “Factors\nthat a factfinder should consider when determining the reasonableness of a fee include:\n(1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,\nand the skill required to perform the legal service properly; (2) the likelihood ... that the\nacceptance of the particular employment will preclude other employment by the\nlawyer; (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; (4) the\n\n                                             28\n\famount involved and the results obtained; (5) the time limitations imposed by the client\nor by the circumstances; (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with\nthe client; (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers\nperforming the services ; and (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results\nobtained or uncertainty of collection before the legal services have been rendered.”\nSee Arthur Andersen, 945 S.W.2d at 818.\n\n       We uphold the bankruptcy court’s factual determination of the reasonableness\nof both the hourly fees and the fifty percent contingency fee. The court cited Arthur\nAndersen and thereunder plainly evaluated Artoc’s case against Apex and Artoc’s fee\nagreements with the Breed Abbott and Fehrenbacher firms with patent regard for the\nrequisite factors. The Texas Supreme Court made clear in Arthur Andersen that the\nanalysis is a case-by-case project in which the factfinder “must decide the question of\n[the reasonableness and necessity of] attorney’s fees specifically in light of the work\nperformed in the very case for which the fee is sought.” Id. at 819. The record\nindicates that the court examined with care and sense a sufficient presentation of\nevidence upon which it based its conclusion that the contingent fee was reasonable and\nnecessary.\n\nProportionality\n\n       Apex also argues that the fee award is improper because it is out of balance with\nthe amount of the allowed underlying claim. While the extent of apparent\nproportionality of a fee award to the substantive amount in controversy is a valid\nconsideration in the reasonableness determination, it is not alone a dispositive factor,\neven in a case of sizeable disparity as, for example, a fee award two and one half times\nthe amount of the underlying claim. See Gorman, 1 S.W.2d at 919. Again, it is\napparent that the bankruptcy court took into account the required and relevant\nconsiderations under Arthur Andersen in finding the fee award appropriate overall. Its\n\n\n                                          29\n\fproportional largesse alone is not enough to overcome the other factors consistently\nbehind the court’s conclusion.\n\nContingency Enhancement of the Lodestar\n\n      Finally, Apex argues that the bankruptcy court’s allowance of the Fehrenbacher\nfee constitutes error because it effectively amounts to enhancing a lodestar for a\ncontingency, and cites the Supreme Court’s opinion in City of Burlington v. Dague,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112778\"><a href=\"/opinion/112778/burlington-v-dague/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 565 (1992), for the proposition that such a procedure is impermissible.\n\n       Apex is correct that Dague holds that enhancement of a lodestar calculation for\ncontingency is not permitted, at least under federal fee-shifting statutes. However, the\nbankruptcy court did not enhance a lodestar calculation in awarding the contingent fees\nof the Fehrenbacher firm. Instead, the court analyzed the reasonableness and\nnecessity of an award of fees pursuant to the contingency agreement under the\napplicable state law and, having plausibly determined it sound, endorsed the award at\nthe contract rate.\n\n      “A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts in an unreasonable and arbitrary\nmanner or without reference to any guiding rules or principles.

Aquamarine Operators, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2436853\"><a href=\"/opinion/2436853/downer-v-aquamarine-operators-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">701</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241-\n242 (Tex. 1985). The bankruptcy court exercised care in considering the lengthy and\ncomplex record on the issue of fees in this case. The factual findings are supported\nand the law relied upon is valid. The bankruptcy court made no error of law or\njudgment and did not abuse its discretion. The award of attorneys’ fees is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f                                    III\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n      Having found no abuse of discretion and no clear error of judgment or of law\nmade by the bankruptcy court in any of the four orders from which the Debtor\nappeals, the decisions and judgment therewith are affirmed.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n            Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. BANKRUPTCY APPELLATE PANEL,\n                     EIGHTH CIRCUIT\n\n\n\n\n                                       31\n\f</pre>",
