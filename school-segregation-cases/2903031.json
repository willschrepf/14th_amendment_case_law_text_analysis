After a month-long trial, a federal jury convicted\nBolden of killing Ley with a firearm during an attempted bank robbery, conspiracy to\ncommit bank robbery, and being a felon-in-possession of a firearm. The jury\nsentenced him to death for the bank robbery-murder and firearm offenses. See 18\n\n\n\n      *\n      The HONORABLE DAVID M. EBEL, United States Circuit Judge for the\nTenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fU.S.C. §§ 2113(e), 924(j)(1). Bolden appeals, arguing the district court1 committed\nsome thirty reversible errors prior to and during trial. We will first address the three\nissues emphasized at oral argument. After careful review of the record, we affirm.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n       Dominick Price testified that, on the morning of October 7, 2002, Bolden asked\nPrice to help rob a Bank of America branch because Bolden needed $2,000 to avoid\nbeing evicted from his home. As the two “cased” the bank, Bolden told a hesitant\nPrice his plan: Bolden would brandish his handgun and disarm the guard outside the\nbank, then Bolden and Price would take the guard into the bank as a hostage, demand\nmoney, and drive away in Bolden’s car. The two men purchased nylon stocking caps,\nand Bolden recruited a third man, Corteze Edwards, to assist in the robbery.\n\n       Early that afternoon, the trio dressed in dark clothing and drove to a parking lot\nnear the bank. Price and Edwards wore masks. Bolden did not. When bank guard\nLey walked out of the bank, Bolden approached on foot, with Price and Edwards\nfifteen-to-twenty feet behind. Price testified that Bolden stopped a short distance from\nLey and pointed his handgun at the guard. After a brief dialog, Ley reached for the\ngun, and they struggled. Bolden regained control of the gun and shot Ley in the jaw.\nAs Ley fell, Bolden took a step back and fired another shot into Ley’s head. Ley died\nfrom the second wound later that afternoon. The three robbers ran off, shedding\nclothing as they ran. Many bystanders witnessed the shooting. One saw Bolden drive\naway, and he was arrested that evening. Clothing found near the bank tested positive\nfor traces of DNA from Bolden, Price, and Edwards. A later search of Bolden’s home\nuncovered the handgun used to kill Ley and ammunition matching that found during\nLey’s autopsy.\n\n\n      1\n        The HONORABLE CAROL E. JACKSON, Chief Judge of the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Missouri.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                               II. A Batson Challenge\n\n       Before trial, the government used a peremptory challenge to strike prospective\njuror number 44, an African American woman. Bolden argued the strike violated\nBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986), which held that it is a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause for the government to use a peremptory challenge to strike a\nprospective juror solely on the basis of race. After the district court ruled that Bolden\nestablished a prima facie case of discrimination, the government claimed that it struck\njuror 44 for a race-neutral ground -- because, when asked to elaborate on her\nquestionnaire response that the criminal justice system should use legal students for\nresearch, she explained that she believed based on twelve years of legal training that\nusing legal students for research would assist the criminal justice system. The\ngovernment expressed concern that she might give more weight to her legal training\nthan is warranted and that there was no way to know how this experience might affect\nthe deliberation process.2\n\n       The district court found that this was a race-neutral reason, comparing the strike\nof juror 44 with the government’s strike of juror 142, a white high school teacher who\nsaid he often discussed constitutional law issues with his students. The court rejected\nBolden’s assertion that juror 44 should be compared with non-stricken white juror\n176, a deputy clerk for a Missouri court who stated in her questionnaire that her\n“passion is to see criminals convicted,” and that she has a favorable view of the court\nsystem based upon her son’s fair treatment for pending drug related charges. The\ncourt’s ultimate finding was that Bolden failed to prove that the strike of juror 44 was\nmotivated by race discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The government also claimed that an Assistant United States Attorney may\nhave offended juror 44 when he addressed her by the wrong name. The district court\ndid not credit this reason.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       On appeal, Bolden argues the district court clearly erred when it denied his\nBatson challenge because the government’s purported race-neutral reason for striking\njuror 44 was implausible. We review the court’s Batson rulings for clear error,\nkeeping in mind that “the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation\nrests with, and never shifts from the party opposing the strike.” Purkett v. Elem, 514\nU.S. 765, 768 (1995); see Snyder v. Louisiana, 128 S. Ct. 1203, 1208 (2008). After\ncareful review of the questionnaire responses and voir dire testimony, and giving the\ndistrict court’s findings the “great deference” Batson requires, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21, we\nconclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government stated\na race-neutral reason for striking juror 44 that was adequately supported by the record.\nCompare United States v. Ortiz, 315 F.3d 873, 896-97 (8th Cir. 2002), cert. denied,\n540 U.S. 1073 (2003).\n\n                        III. Statutory Aggravating Factors\n\n       The Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 (“FDPA”) provides that, if the\ndefendant has been found guilty of a homicide offense for which the death penalty\nmay be imposed, the trial judge “shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to\ndetermine the punishment to be imposed.” 18 U.S.C. § 3593(b). At this hearing,\n“information may be presented as to any matter relevant to the sentence, including any\nmitigating or aggravating factor,” regardless of its admissibility under the Federal\nRules of Evidence. § 3593(c). The jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt at least\none of sixteen “aggravating factors” before it may impose the death penalty; the\ngovernment has the burden of proving “any aggravating factor . . . beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” Id. The defendant has the burden of proving “any mitigating\nfactor . . . by a preponderance of the evidence.” Id. The jury then considers “all the\ninformation received during the hearing,” and returns “special findings” identifying\nthe statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors it has unanimously found to exist,\nand the mitigating factors that one or more jurors have found to exist. If no statutory\naggravating factor is found beyond a reasonable doubt, “the court shall impose a\n\n                                           -4-\n\fsentence other than death.” § 3593(d). If the jury instead finds the requisite mental\nstate and one or more statutory aggravating factors, then it “shall consider whether all\nthe aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating\nfactor or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death” and, based upon this\nconsideration, recommend by unanimous vote “whether the defendant should be\nsentenced to death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other\nlesser sentence.” § 3593(e).\n\n       Bolden’s superseding indictment alleged and the jury found two aggravating\nfactors, “pecuniary gain” and “conviction for two felony drug offenses.” See\n§§ 3592(c)(8), (10). Bolden challenges those findings on multiple grounds.3\n\n        A. Pecuniary Gain. Committing a homicide “as consideration for the receipt,\nor in the expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value” is an aggravating\nfactor. 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(8). In this case, the district court instructed the jury only\non the second clause -- the government must prove that Bolden “committed the\nkilling or murder in the expectation of anything in the form of money, property, or\nanything else having some economic value, benefit or advantage.” Emphasizing the\nfirst clause, Bolden argues that the pecuniary gain factor only applies to a murder-for-\nhire. He urges us to read subsection (c)(8) in tandem with subsection (c)(7), which\napplies to a defendant who “procured the commission of the offense by payment, or\npromise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value.”\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        Bolden also argues that the district court should have dismissed the indictment\nbecause the government misled the grand jury concerning the evidence of these\naggravating factors. We disagree. This allegation of prosecutorial misconduct during\nthe grand jury proceedings was rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by the\npetit jury’s guilty verdict. United States v. Sanders, 341 F.3d 809, 818-19 (8th Cir.\n2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1227 (2004).\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       Bolden did not raise this issue in the district court, so our review is for plain\nerror. At least five other circuits agree that § 3592(c)(8) applies, not only to murder-\nfor-hire, but also when the murder itself, and not just an underlying offense such as\nrobbery, was committed with the expectation of pecuniary gain. As the Eleventh\nCircuit explained, “The ‘consideration’ and ‘expectation’ clauses are two separate\nways by which the pecuniary gain factor may be satisfied, and they both must have\nmeaning.” United States v. Brown, 441 F.3d 1330, 1370 (11th Cir. 2006), cert.\ndenied, 127 S. Ct. 1149 (2007); accord United States v. Mitchell, 502 F.3d 931, 974-\n75 (9th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 2902 (2008); United States v. Barnette, 390\nF.3d 775, 784-85 (4th Cir. 2004), vacated on other grounds, 546 U.S. 803 (2005);\nUnited States v. Bernard, 299 F.3d 467, 483-84 (5th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S.\n928 (2003); United States v. Chanthadara, 230 F.3d 1237, 1263-64 (10th Cir. 2000),\ncert. denied, 534 U.S. 992 (2001). Though we have never addressed the issue, our\nprior decisions are consistent with these cases. See United States v. Paul, 217 F.3d\n989, 995 n.2, 1001 (8th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 829 (2001). There was no\nplain error.\n\n       Bolden next contends that, even if § 3592(c)(8) may apply to some bank\nrobbers, there was insufficient evidence that he killed Ley in the expectation of\npecuniary gain, rather than to eliminate an eyewitness and to escape from a botched\nrobbery. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an aggravating\nfactor, we “consider whether any rational trier of fact could have found the\naggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.” Ortiz, 315 F.3d at 902.\n\n       We agree with Bolden that the pecuniary gain factor applies to a killing during\nthe course of a bank robbery only “where pecuniary gain is expected to follow as a\ndirect result of the murder.” Bernard, 299 F.3d at 483; see Mitchell, 502 F.3d at 975;\nBrown, 441 F.3d at 1370-71. Bolden relies heavily on Bernard, but in that case\ndefendants killed the victims after a completed robbery and carjacking solely to\neliminate them as witnesses. 299 F.3d at 472-73, 483-84. Here, by contrast, Bolden\n\n                                          -6-\n\fbrought a loaded handgun to the bank planning to confront the bank guard before\nrobbing the bank. Price testified that, when he and Bolden returned to his house after\nthe failed robbery, Bolden “was mad that . . . we didn’t complete the bank robbery,”\nsaid “that the guard was stupid,” and referred to the event as a “wasted trip.” These\nstatements were sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that Bolden shot Ley to\nremove an obstacle to completing the robbery and that his intention was to continue\nwith the robbery once Ley had been removed. Thus, the killing was committed in the\nexpectation of receiving pecuniary gain. 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(8). Bolden also told\nPrice, “it was either shoot the guard or spend the rest of his life in jail.” But the statute\ndoes not require that pecuniary gain be the only motive for a murder.\n\n       Finally, Bolden argues that the pecuniary gain instruction allowed the jury to\nfind this factor based solely on his motive for the underlying robbery because the\ndistrict court refused to charge that pecuniary gain “was expected to follow as a direct\nresult of the murder.” The court instead instructed:\n\n       To establish that a defendant committed the killing or murder in the\n       expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value, the\n       government must prove that the defendant committed the killing or\n       murder in the expectation of anything in the form of money, property, or\n       anything else having some economic value, benefit or advantage.\n\nThis instruction accurately stated the law. Moreover, by substituting “the killing or\nmurder” for the reference to “the offense” in § 3592(c)(8), the instruction made clear\nthat the jury could not find this aggravating factor based solely on Bolden’s attempt\nto rob the bank for pecuniary gain. See Chanthadara, 230 F.3d at 1263-64. The\ndistrict court did not abuse its wide discretion in formulating this instruction. See\nUnited States v. Phelps, 168 F.3d 1048, 1057 (8th Cir. 1999) (standard of review).\n\n      B. Prior Drug Distribution Offenses. The jury also found a second statutory\naggravating factor, that Bolden was previously convicted of two or more felony\n\n                                            -7-\n\foffenses “committed on different occasions, involving the distribution of a controlled\nsubstance.” § 3592(c)(10). Bolden concedes that the government established one\nprior offense, a 1995 Michigan conviction for delivery of cocaine. But he contends\nthat the second offense on which the government relied, a 1993 Michigan conviction\nfor “attempted possession with intent to deliver cocaine,” was not an offense\n“involving the distribution of a controlled substance.” He argues, without citation to\ncase law or legislative history, that “Congress did not use the term ‘involving’ to\nencompass convictions based on mere ‘attempts’ or ‘intents.’” The government\nresponds that the term, “offenses . . . involving distribution,” is not limited to actual\ndistribution offenses; it should be read to include offenses where drug distribution was\nattempted but thwarted by police intervention. In this case, for example, the\ngovernment introduced the transcript of Bolden’s 1993 guilty plea hearing at which\nhe expressly admitted that he had intended to sell at least some of the crack cocaine\nfound in his possession.\n\n       Reviewing the district court’s interpretation of statutory aggravating factors de\nnovo, we agree with the government. See United States v. Allen, 247 F.3d 741, 786\n(8th Cir. 2001) (standard of review), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 536\nU.S. 953 (2002), decision on remand, 406 F.3d 940 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc). We\nconstrued the statutory term, “involving the distribution . . . of any controlled\nsubstance,” in a former version of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(2) “as including more than the\ncrime[] of distribution.” United States v. Matra, 841 F.2d 837, 843 (8th Cir. 1988).\nSupporting that interpretation, the Supreme Court recently observed in construing 18\nU.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B), “An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a government building\n. . . would ‘involv[e] [the] use of explosives.’” James v. United States, 127 S. Ct.\n1586, 1592 (2007). Likewise, we conclude, the term “involving the distribution of a\ncontrolled substance” in § 3592(c)(10) includes attempt offenses. Bolden’s contention\nthat the word “involving” in § 3592(c)(10) should be construed as excluding attempt\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\foffenses because the aggravating factors in §§ 3592(c)(2) and (4) expressly include\nattempt offenses is unpersuasive.4\n\n        Bolden further argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting\ntestimony by a Michigan police officer detailing suspected drug trafficking activity\nthat preceded Bolden’s 1993 arrest and conviction for “attempted possession with\nintent to distribute cocaine.” Bolden argues this permitted the jury to find the\n§ 3592(c)(10) factor based upon uncharged conduct. (He does not argue that the\nevidence was insufficient to support this finding or that the court erred in instructing\nthe jury.) The FDPA “erects very low barriers to the admission of evidence at capital\nsentencing hearings.” United States v. Lee, 274 F.3d 485, 494 (8th Cir. 2001), cert.\ndenied, 537 U.S. 1000 (2002).5 Such a rule is necessary to ensure that the death\npenalty phase produces “an individualized determination on the basis of the character\nof the individual and the circumstances of the crime.” Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862,\n879 (1983) (emphasis in original). There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this\nevidence.\n\n      Finally, Bolden argues that § 3592(c)(10) is unconstitutional as applied in this\ncase because prior remote nonviolent drug offenses do not rationally narrow the class\nof death-eligible defendants, as required by Zant, 462 U.S. at 877 & n.15. We\ndisagree. Bolden cites no case in which a court invalidated a death-eligibility factor\nbecause it failed to identify prior conduct of sufficient gravity. In Allen, 247 F.3d at\n\n\n      4\n       The James Court construed “involves use of explosives” in § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nas including the crime of attempt even though § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), the immediately\npreceding subsection, expressly includes prior attempt convictions.\n      5\n       18 U.S.C. § 3593(c) provides: “[I]nformation may be presented as to any\nmatter relevant to the sentence . . . . regardless of its admissibility under the rules\ngoverning admission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be\nexcluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair\nprejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.”\n\n                                          -9-\n\f761, we held that the FDPA statutory factors “adequately narrow[] the class of persons\neligible for the death penalty,” observing that “how broadly or how narrowly the death\npenalty should be applied as a punishment, if at all, is essentially a political choice left\nto the people’s elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches.”\nCongress has repeatedly enacted severe sentencing enhancements for recidivist drug\ntraffickers. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b). We conclude that § 3592(c)(10) identifies\ncircumstances that reasonably justify imposition of a more severe sentence for\nmurder.6\n\n                            IV. Penalty Phase Bifurcation\n\n         As the plain language of §§ 3593(b)-(e) summarized at the start of Part III\nmakes clear, the FDPA contemplates a single penalty phase hearing at which all\nrelevant evidence is admitted and, if the defendant is found eligible for the death\npenalty, ultimately weighed by the jury. A number of district courts have nonetheless\ngranted pre-hearing motions to bifurcate the penalty phase (or, as some have phrased\nit, “trifurcate” the entire trial) into an “eligibility phase,” limited to evidence relevant\nto mental state and to the existence of one or more statutory aggravating factors, and,\nif the defendant is found eligible, a “selection phase,” at which evidence relevant to\nmitigating factors and non-statutory aggravating factors such as victim impact and\nother crimes is received and weighed by the jury. See, e.g., United States v. Natson,\n444 F. Supp. 2d 1296, 1309 (M.D. Ga. 2006); United States v. Mayhew, 380 F. Supp.\n\n       6\n        Even if the finding of the § 3592(c)(10) aggravating factor was not sustained,\nonly one statutory aggravating factor need be found. § 3593(d). We may not “reverse\nor vacate a sentence of death on account of . . . any erroneous special finding of an\naggravating factor, where the Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe error was harmless.” § 3595(c)(2). As the evidence relevant to the Michigan drug\nconvictions was admissible in any event and the jury could have given this evidence\naggravating weight under the non-statutory aggravating factor “other criminal\nconduct,” any error in submitting this statutory factor was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. See Brown v. Sanders, 546 U.S. 212, 220 (2006).\n\n                                           -10-\n\f2d 936, 955-57 (S.D. Oh. 2005); United States v. Johnson, 362 F. Supp. 2d 1043,\n1099-1111 (N.D. Ia. 2005) (tried under 21 U.S.C. § 848, not the FDPA), aff’d\n(without discussing this issue), 495 F.3d 951 (8th Cir. 2007); United States v. Jordan,\n357 F. Supp. 2d 889, 903-04 (E.D.Va. 2005); United States v. Davis, 912 F. Supp.\n938, 949 (E.D. La. 1996).\n\n       In this case, Bolden filed a pretrial motion to bifurcate the penalty phase\nhearing. He argued that the government’s evidence of other crimes was relevant only\nto a non-statutory aggravating factor but would invite the jury to resolve the eligibility\nissues, his mental state and the alleged statutory aggravating factors, based on his bad\ncharacter as evidenced by his criminal history. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that the jury would follow the court’s eligibility instructions. On appeal,\nBolden argues this issue very differently, asserting that the government’s extensive\nvictim impact evidence “enhanced the risk” that the jury would find him eligible for\ndeath despite the government’s weak proof of either statutory aggravating factor. He\nprovides no citation to the voluminous record establishing that he made this argument\nto the district court, either before or during the sentencing hearing.\n\n         The government argues that bifurcation is statutorily impermissible.7 The only\ncircuit to address this issue under the FDPA concluded that the statute contemplates\nbut does not require a single penalty phase proceeding and encouraged district courts\nruling on motions to trifurcate “to consider carefully the ramifications of presenting\n. . . evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible in the guilt phase . . . to a jury that\nhas not yet made findings concerning death eligibility.” United States v. Fell, 531\nF.3d 197, 240 n.28 (2d Cir. 2008). We agree that is a sound reading of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       We note the government requested bifurcation in Jordan, 357 F. Supp. 2d at\n903, to ensure the jury would consider at the selection phase hearsay evidence that\nmight be inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause at the eligibility phase.\n\n                                           -11-\n\f       As no case has held that bifurcation is mandatory, we think it obvious that the\nruling on a motion to bifurcate the penalty phase of an FDPA proceeding is reviewed\nfor abuse of discretion. Such a motion should not be routinely granted because it\nfurther extends and complicates what is already a long and complicated proceeding.\nMoreover, as this case illustrates, penalty phase evidence such as prior crimes may be\nrelevant to both statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors. See 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3592(c)(2)-(4), (10), (12), (15). In such cases, the risk of improper spillover will\nbe negligible if the jury is properly instructed and is in any event outweighed by the\nrisk of unnecessary protraction and confusion.\n\n      Bolden moved to bifurcate based on the risk that other crimes evidence would\nprejudice the jury’s consideration of eligibility issues. Bolden does not argue that risk\non appeal. Instead, he argues that the government’s victim impact evidence\n“enhanced the risk,” an issue not pursued in the district court. In its final penalty\nphase instructions, the court carefully instructed the jury:\n\n      You many not consider the victim impact evidence in deciding the\n      preliminary issues of whether the defendant is at least 18 years old,\n      whether he acted with a mental state listed in Instruction No. 3, or\n      whether any statutory aggravating circumstances in Instruction No. 4\n      exists beyond a reasonable doubt. If you make the findings on those\n      three preliminary issues which are required before the death penalty can\n      be considered, you many consider the victim impact evidence . . . . You\n      may not, however, permit the victim impact testimony to overwhelm\n      your ability to follow the law.\n\nJurors are presumed to follow their instructions, and there is no indication in the\nrecord that they did not do so. Shannon v. United States, 512 U.S. 573, 584-85\n(1994). The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to bifurcate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\f                              V. Other Pretrial Issues\n\n       A. Motion To Suppress. At a proffer interview in January 2003, Price told\ninvestigators that Bolden hid the handgun used to shoot Ley under a gutter behind\nBolden’s rented residence. FBI Agent Terrence McGinnis left the interview, drove\nto the residence, and entered the backyard. He saw a white plastic bag peeking out\nfrom under a gutter, removed the bag, and found the murder weapon, a loaded .22\ncaliber revolver. Bolden argues the district court should have suppressed the handgun\nbecause it was found during a warrantless search of his residence conducted without\nthe consent of Bolden or his landlord. The district court denied the motion to suppress\nfor lack of standing, that is, a subjective expectation of privacy in the exterior of his\nformer residence that was objectively reasonable. See United States v. Stallings, 28\nF.3d 58, 60 (8th Cir. 1994); United States v. Kiser, 948 F.2d 418, 423 (8th Cir. 1991),\ncert. denied, 503 U.S. 983 (1992).\n\n       After a hearing, the district court found that Bolden’s landlord initiated eviction\nproceedings when she heard of his arrest because he was delinquent on rent payments.\nThe eviction was final in November 2002, the landlord retook possession in early\nDecember, and the residence was vandalized and robbed well before Price’s proffer\ninterview. Bolden argued that the landlord’s history of forgiving his rent deficiencies\nand the fact that eviction notices were returned undelivered gave him a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the premises. The district court disagreed, noting that\nBolden knew he was facing eviction before killing Ley, yet made no attempt to\nprevent eviction and asserted no continuing possessory interest in the residence after\nhis arrest:\n\n      [T]he defendant’s lack of any possessory interest in the premises at the\n      time of the search, his failure to exclude others from entering the\n      premises, and his failure to take precautions to maintain privacy support\n      the conclusion that the defendant had no subjective expectation of\n      privacy and that no such expectation was objectively reasonable.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fThe court’s finding that Bolden had no subjective expectation of privacy is not clearly\nerroneous. See Kiser, 948 F.2d at 423 (standard of review). And on these facts, we\nagree with the court’s legal conclusion that any subjective expectation of privacy in\nthe exterior of his former residence was not objectively reasonable. See United States\nv. Hoey, 983 F.2d 890, 892 (8th Cir. 1993); United States v. Rambo, 789 F.2d 1289,\n1295-96 (8th Cir. 1986). The motion to suppress was properly denied.\n\n      B. Motion To Quash a Venire Panel. During voir dire, the district court asked\nwhether any member of one panel had read or heard anything about Bolden’s alleged\ncrime. Prospective juror 168 responded:\n\n      Close friend of mine works with the victim’s aunt. And when I was\n      telling him about my jury duty here, he told me what she had told him\n      about what happened and the family’s wishes and things like that.\n\nHe later stated, “I think what [my friend] told me may influence my decision . . .\n[p]ossibly in the second phase, if there was a second phase.” Bolden made no\ncontemporaneous objection but later moved to quash the entire panel. The district\ncourt denied the motion, noting the panel could not infer from 168’s statement that\nLey’s family favored the death penalty. The court struck 168 for cause. It later\ninstructed the jury:\n\n      You are not to be influenced by the speculation concerning what\n      sentence you think the victim’s family might wish to see imposed on the\n      defendant. There is no evidence before you concerning what opinions\n      the members of the victim’s family might have on what sentence is\n      imposed. Indeed, there is no evidence that the family members of the\n      victim have any opinions on the issue at all.\n\n       On appeal Bolden argues the district court erred in refusing to quash the panel,\nan issue we review for abuse of discretion. We agree with the district court that juror\n168’s ambiguous, unsolicited statement did not so infect the panel with possible bias\n\n                                         -14-\n\fas to require that it be quashed. Bolden’s counsel spent portions of the next three days\nexhaustively questioning each potential juror for bias and preconceptions. Moreover,\nstriking juror 168 for cause and cautioning the jury not to speculate about what\nsentence Ley’s family might want were adequate protections against possible\nimproper prejudice. There was no abuse of discretion. See United States v. Rosnow,\n977 F.2d 399, 411-12 (8th Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 990 (1993).\n\n                                VI. Guilt Phase Issues\n\n       A. Separate trial of the Felon-in-Possession Charge. Prior to trial, Bolden\nmoved for a separate trial of the felon-in-possession count. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n14(a). The district court denied the motion, concluding that Bolden would not be\nprejudiced by the joinder because a stipulation ensured that the jury would know only\nthe fact of his prior felony convictions, not the facts underlying those convictions, see\nOld Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 186-92 (1997), and because the court would\ninstruct the jury to consider each count separately.\n\n        Bolden argues the court abused its discretion by denying separate trials. This\ncontention is without merit. As the district court noted, we have repeatedly upheld the\ndenial of this motion when the parties have entered into such a stipulation. See United\nStates v. Brown, 70 F.3d 979, 980 (8th Cir. 1995), and case cited, cert. denied, 517\nU.S. 1114 (1996). Bolden cites no authority for his contention that trial courts have\na greater duty to grant separate trials in capital cases. Here, the district court\ninstructed the jury that it could not consider Bolden’s previous convictions when\ndetermining whether the government proved the other counts. The court did not abuse\nits discretion in denying separate trials. See United States v. Crouch, 46 F.3d 871, 875\n(8th Cir.) (standard of review), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 871 (1995).\n\n       B. Testimony of Dominick Price. Bolden challenges three evidentiary rulings\narising out of government witness Price’s testimony. First, he contends that the\ndistrict court prejudicially limited cross-examination. On direct exam, Price testified\n                                           -15-\n\fthat he and Edwards were childhood friends and Bolden persuaded the two younger\nmen to assist in the bank robbery. During cross exam, Price admitted he saw Edwards\nin jail after their arrest and the two men fought. Bolden’s counsel asked Price to\nelaborate, the government objected, and the district court sustained the objection,\nexplaining that the three men voluntarily committed the crime and it was irrelevant\nwhether Edwards and Price later became enemies while in jail. Bolden argues the\ncourt abused its discretion because this testimony would have impeached Price’s\ncredibility and the government’s attempt to portray Price as remorseful.8\n\n       “We will not reverse a trial court’s decision to limit cross-examination absent\na clear abuse of discretion and a showing of prejudice to the defendant.” United\nStates v. Purkey, 428 F.3d 738, 753 (8th Cir. 2005) (quotations omitted), cert. denied,\n127 S. Ct. 433 (2006). As the district court noted, the relationship between Price and\nEdwards after the crime was not relevant to Bolden’s guilt or his role in the offense.\nThus, the question is whether a reasonable jury would have gained a significantly\ndifferent impression of Price’s credibility had the court allowed Bolden to pursue the\nproposed line of cross-examination. United States v. Beckman, 222 F.3d 512, 524\n(8th Cir. 2000). A review of the record persuades us that the answer to this question\nis no. Bolden’s cross exam of Price was extensive (102 pages of the trial transcript).\nThe jury heard about Price’s drug dealings with Bolden and others, and Price’s prior\narrests for disturbing the peace, petty larceny, motor vehicle theft, assault, disturbing\nthe peace, and unlawful use of a firearm. There was no clear abuse of discretion.\n\n       Second, Bolden argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying\nhis request for re-cross exam regarding possible coaching Price may have received\nduring an observed conversation with government counsel, or while the government’s\ncase agent was together with Price in a holding cell. Government counsel explained\n\n\n      8\n       His argument that this testimony was also relevant to penalty-phase issues was\nnot preserved in the district court and cannot survive plain error review. See Revels\nv. Vincenz, 382 F.3d 870, 877 (8th Cir. 2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 860 (2005).\n                                          -16-\n\fthat, in the observed conversation, he declined Price’s offer to explain the incident\nwith Edwards in jail. Counsel explained that the case agent was in the holding cell\nonly because there was a problem removing Price’s shackles. When Bolden’s counsel\nwas unable to point out discrepancies between Price’s direct and redirect testimony,\nor instances when his memory appeared to be refreshed or his answers shaded, the\ndistrict court denied the request. There was no abuse of the court’s wide discretion\nto restrict re-cross exam, particularly when new matters have not been raised on\nredirect. United States v. Ball, 499 F.3d 890, 897 (8th Cir. 2007).\n\n       Finally, Bolden argues that the district court erred by allowing Price to testify\nto a legal conclusion. During cross exam, Price testified:\n\n      [Defense counsel]: And didn’t you decide that you, Robert, and Corteze\n      were going to split the money? Whatever was taken, was going to be\n      split three ways?\n\n      [Price]: Equally, yes.\n\n      [Counsel]: Yes. All of you were going to be treated equally?\n\n      [Price]: Yes, sir.\n\n      [Counsel]: Because you were all equal participants?\n\n      [Price]: Yes, sir.\n\nOn redirect, government counsel referred to this exchange and asked Price whether\nhe was an equal participant in the shooting of Ley. The district court overruled\nBolden’s objection that the question called for a legal conclusion, and Price answered,\n“no.” On appeal, Bolden argues that this opinion testimony improperly allowed the\ngovernment to negate two statutory mitigating circumstances, that an equally culpable\nco-defendant would not be punished by death, and that neither Price nor Edwards\nwould serve a death sentence or a life sentence for the offense.\n                                         -17-\n\f       Opinion testimony by a lay witness is not per se inadmissible, even if it\naddresses an ultimate issue. Fed. R. Evid. 701, 704(a). Here, the government’s\ninquiry was a fair response to the testimony elicited on cross exam because it\naddressed the distinction between being “equal participants” in the planned robbery\nand in the unplanned murder of Ley. “The trial court does not abuse its discretion by\nallowing the use of evidence on redirect examination to clarify an issue that was\nopened up by the defense on cross-examination -- even when this evidence would\notherwise be inadmissible.” United States v. Braidlow, 806 F.2d 781, 783 (8th Cir.\n1986). Moreover, the question did not elicit an improper legal opinion. While the\ndefense was no doubt pursuing a legal question, equal culpability, Price was testifying\nfrom the lay perspective of equal sharing or participation. When the government went\nfurther and asked Price whether he deserved the death penalty for his role in the crime,\nthe district court halted the inquiry. There was no abuse of the district court’s wide\ndiscretion to control the scope of redirect examination. Braidlow, 806 F.2d at 783\n(standard of review).\n\n        C. Agent McGinnis’s Notes. Prior to trial, the district court ordered that\ngovernment agents retain any rough notes that might concern Bolden’s case, and the\ngovernment agreed to provide Bolden with exculpatory information and any promises\nmade in exchange for witness testimony. See generally Giglio v. United States, 405\nU.S. 150 (1972). At trial, FBI agent McGinnis testified that he took notes during the\nportion of Price’s proffer interview he attended before proceeding to Bolden’s\nresidence, which contradicted the government’s pretrial claim that only two Assistant\nUnited States Attorneys took notes during the proffer. Defense counsel complained\nthat, in failing to turn over McGinnis’s notes, the government violated both Brady v.\nMaryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b). Government\ncounsel represented that he had not known the notes existed, had now reviewed the\nnotes, and concluded they contained no Brady materials. The district court ruled that\nBolden did not make a sufficient showing that the notes contained Brady or Jencks\nAct materials. Bolden challenges that ruling on appeal.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f       (1) To establish a Brady violation, Bolden must show that the prosecution\nsuppressed material evidence favorable to the defense. United States v. Van Brocklin,\n115 F.3d 587, 594 (8th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 523 U.S. 1122 (1998). Materiality\nturns on “whether there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been\ndisclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”\nClay v. Bowersox, 367 F.3d 993, 1000 (8th Cir. 2004) (quotation omitted), cert.\ndenied, 544 U.S. 1035 (2005). Bolden argues the notes might contain exculpatory\ninformation because there was a discrepancy between McGinnis’s testimony at a\npretrial hearing and his testimony at trial concerning whether Bolden told Price the\ngun was hidden under a gutter at Bolden’s residence. Review of the notes, Bolden\nargues, might have impeached Price’s trial testimony and “bolstered doubts that\nBolden was the gunman.” However, the alleged discrepancy is based upon a portion\nof McGinnis’s cross exam during the pretrial hearing. McGinnis clarified the point\nduring redirect. Thus, viewed in total, McGinnis’s pretrial and trial testimony were\nconsistent. Bolden further argues that the notes could have exposed Price’s\nmotivations for testifying but offers no support for this supposition. The government\ndisclosed all promises it made to Price in exchange for his cooperation, and defense\ncounsel thoroughly cross-examined Price on the subject. Bolden failed to show that\nthe government suppressed material exculpatory evidence.9\n\n       (2) As relevant here, the Jencks Act requires the government to produce, on\nmotion of the defendant after a government witness has testified, “a written statement\nmade by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him” relating\nto the witness’s testimony. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(1). Here, McGinnis testified his\nnotes contained only statements made by Price. Thus, the notes were not a “statement\nmade by said witness,” and Bolden made no showing that Price signed the notes or\n\n\n      9\n        With little elaboration, Bolden also argues the government should have\nprovided all rough notes from police interviews of persons who witnessed the\nshooting. This argument is without merit. He made no showing that any rough\ninterview notes even existed. Van Brocklin, 115 F.3d at 595.\n                                       -19-\n\fotherwise approved them. See United States v. Madrigal, 152 F.3d 777, 782 (8th Cir.\n1998). Accordingly, the district court correctly ruled that the notes were not subject\nto review under the Jencks Act. See United States v. New, 491 F.3d 369, 376-77 (8th\nCir. 2007) (“the purpose of the disclosure requirement is to assist the defense in cross-\nexamining the witness who made the statement, not with questioning some other\nwitness”). Bolden argues on appeal that the notes were Jencks Act material regarding\nMcGinnis’s investigation. That contention was not raised in the district court and\ncannot survive plain error review. See United States v. Grajales-Montoya, 117 F.3d\n356, 363 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1007 (1997).\n\n                          VII. Other Penalty Phase Issues\n\n       A. Non-Statutory Aggravating Factors. After listing the statutory aggravating\nfactors, the FDPA provides that the jury “may consider whether any other aggravating\nfactor for which notice has been given exists.” 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c). In this case, the\ngovernment gave notice, the district court submitted, and the jury found three non-\nstatutory aggravating factors: obstruction of justice, other criminal conduct, and victim\nimpact. Bolden appeals these findings on various grounds. We review the district\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, Allen, 247 F.3d at 778, and\nBolden’s constitutional contentions de novo, Purkey, 428 F.3d at 761.10\n\n       (1) Obstruction of Justice. During the penalty phase, the government presented\nevidence that Bolden lied to police after being arrested, threatened Price and Edwards\nif they spoke about the crime, wiped prints off and hid the murder weapon, and told\nEdwards to change his appearance. The government argued that this aggravating\nfactor was established by evidence that Bolden killed Ley to prevent him from\nidentifying Bolden and then obstructed the investigation by lying to the police and\n\n\n      10\n        The contention that the government violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\nrights by failing to charge non-statutory aggravating factors in the indictment is\nforeclosed by our decision in Purkey, 428 F.3d at 748-50.\n                                       -20-\n\fother post-offense conduct. The jury found as a non-statutory aggravating factor that\nBolden obstructed a criminal investigation and that this factor supported imposition\nof the death penalty.\n\n        Bolden argues his post-offense conduct lacked sufficient relevance to whether\nhe should be sentenced to death. We disagree. Other courts have approved use of an\nobstruction of justice non-statutory aggravating factor based upon post-offense\nconduct. See, e.g., United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 322-23 (4th Cir. 2003)\n(disposing of murder weapon, destroying physical evidence, and directing witnesses\nto lie); United States v. Edelin, 134 F. Supp. 2d 59, 76-77 (D.D.C. 2001) (threatening\nwitnesses). This is consistent with the treatment of obstruction under the Sentencing\nGuidelines. U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. The district court did not err in submitting this non-\nstatutory factor based in part on Bolden’s post-offense conduct.\n\n       Bolden further argues that basing this factor on the killing of Ley renders it\nunconstitutionally vague because all murders eliminate a witness and therefore the\nfactor is only a rational aggravator if the witness is eliminated after the suspect’s\narrest. Again we disagree. The government presented evidence that, after\nimmobilizing Ley with the initial shot, Bolden paused a few seconds before firing the\nfatal shot into Ley’s head, evidence the murder was motivated in part to prevent Ley\nfrom identifying Bolden. Thus, the district court did not err in submitting this non-\nstatutory aggravating factor. Its relative weight was solely for the jury to decide.\n\n       (2) Other Criminal Conduct. At closing argument, the government argued that\nthe jury should find “other criminal activity” as a non-statutory aggravating factor\nbased on Bolden’s conviction of non-capital offenses during the guilt phase --\nconspiracy to commit bank robbery and being a felon-in-possession of a firearm -- and\non his 1993 Michigan conviction for resisting and obstructing a police officer. The\njury found this aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt and that it supported\nimposition of the death penalty. It is well-established that the government may offer\n\n                                        -21-\n\fevidence of “other criminal acts” as a non-statutory aggravating factor. See Allen,\n247 F.3d at 789 and cases cited.\n\n       Bolden argues that this non-statutory factor allowed the government to submit\nthe same evidence to support multiple aggravating factors, creating the risk that the\njury would give too much weight to the aggravating factors, thereby skewing its\nweighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors in deciding whether to impose the\ndeath penalty. Though the concern is legitimate, see Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222,\n232-33 (1992), the Supreme Court has never held “that aggravating factors could be\nduplicative so as to render them constitutionally invalid.” Purkey, 428 F.3d at 762,\nquoting Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 398 (1999) (plurality opinion). The\ngovernment based the pecuniary gain statutory factor on Bolden’s desire to rob the\nbank. It based the obstruction of justice non-statutory factor on his motive to kill Ley\nto eliminate a witness. And it based the “other criminal activity” non-statutory factor\nin part on his possession of a firearm while conspiring to rob the bank. “[T]he same\nfacts can support different inferences that form different aggravators.” Purkey, 428\nF.3d at 762. The district court properly instructed the jurors that in weighing the\naggravating and mitigating factors, they were not simply to count each factor and\nreach a decision based on which number is greater; rather, they should individually\nconsider the weight and value of each factor before deciding whether a sentence of\ndeath is justified. There was no unconstitutional duplication.\n\n       Bolden further argues that, other than the conspiracy conviction, these crimes\nlacked sufficient relevance to the decision. He cites no authority supporting the\nassertion that the district court should have struck the other convictions on this\nground. The district court did not allow the government to introduce less relevant\naspects of Bolden’s criminal history, such as misrepresentations to his landlord and\nemployer, improperly received unemployment benefits, and multiple driving\nviolations. He argues that the Michigan convictions were too remote and allowed the\njury to consider unadjudicated drug trafficking. The record does not support this\nassertion. The court struck testimony regarding drug sales in 1994 that were well\n                                         -22-\n\fbefore Bolden’s 1995 Michigan conviction.11 The government did not argue that the\nMichigan drug offenses or their underlying conduct supported this non-statutory\nfactor, and the jury was instructed that these convictions could not constitute “other\ncrimes” for purposes of this factor. Moreover, in Lee, 274 F.3d at 494-95, we\naffirmed admitting evidence of various unadjudicated offenses.\n\n       (3) Victim Impact Evidence. “[T]he Eighth Amendment erects no per se bar”\nto the admission of victim impact evidence and to prosecutorial argument on that\nsubject. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827 (1991). In the FDPA, Congress\nprovided that the government may introduce as a non-statutory aggravating factor\n“victim impact evidence” including “oral testimony, a victim impact statement that\nidentifies the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss\nsuffered by the victim and the victim’s family, and any other relevant information.”\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(a). Evidence “about the victim and about the impact of the murder\non the victim’s family is relevant to the jury’s decision as to whether or not the death\npenalty should be imposed [and t]here is no reason to treat such evidence differently\nthan other relevant evidence is treated.” Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. However, admission\nof evidence “so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair”\nviolates the Due Process Clause. Id. at 825.\n\n      Bolden contends that the district court erred by allowing sixteen victim impact\nwitnesses to testify during the penalty phase. He argues the testimony was\ncumulative, unfairly prejudicial, and “left the jury one small step removed from actual\nattendance at the victim’s memorial service.” He notes that sixteen witnesses far\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        His contention that the district court erred in denying a mistrial based on this\ntestimony is without merit. See Allen, 247 F.3d at 772 (standard of review). The jury\nis presumed to follow the district court’s prompt instruction to disregard the question\nand answer. Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206-07 (1987).\n                                          -23-\n\fexceeded the number this court has previously approved,12 and that their testimony\ntook up over 80% of the government’s penalty phase case-in-chief. Acknowledging\nthat no appellate court has vacated a federal death sentence on this ground, Bolden\nasserts that no appeal has presented “the voluminous amount and prejudicial quality”\nof impact evidence concerning a single victim.\n\n       Bolden cannot challenge the victim impact testimony by Ley’s parents and\nrelatives. See Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. He contends that allowing Ley’s friends,\ncoworkers, and pastor to testify about Ley’s relationship with his girlfriend, career\naspirations, and the affect of Ley’s death on his parents inflamed the jury, leaving it\nunable to fairly weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. However, Ley’s\naspirations and relationships and the impact of his death on his family were highly\nrelevant to establishing this non-statutory factor. Though portions of this testimony\noverlapped, we agree with the district court it was not so cumulative as to confuse the\nissues or create unfair prejudice.13 Qualitatively, this evidence was similar to the\nvictim impact evidence we upheld in United States v. Johnson, 495 F.3d 951, 977 (8th\nCir. 2007); United States v. Nelson, 347 F.3d 701, 713-14 (8th Cir. 2003), cert.\ndenied, 543 U.S. 978 (2004); Allen, 247 F.3d at 778-79; and Simmons v. Bowersox,\n235 F.3d 1124, 1135 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 924 (2001).\n\n       Bolden’s additional challenges to specific victim impact evidence are without\nmerit. Numerous witnesses read passages they wrote in a memorial journal. This was\nprobative of Ley’s character, not inflammatory, and substantially similar to evidence\ndeemed proper in other cases. See, e.g., Johnson, 495 F.3d at 976-77; Chanthadara,\n230 F.3d at 1274. The government played the tape of a 911 call from Ley’s girlfriend\n\n\n      12\n        In United States v. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1216 (10th Cir. 1998), cert.\ndenied, 526 U.S. 1007 (1999), 38 victim impact witnesses testified about 168 victims\nof the Oklahoma City bombing.\n      13\n       The court observed near the end of the victim impact testimony that the\nwitnesses had been “restrained” and had done their best to control their emotions.\n                                      -24-\n\frequesting a police escort to the hospital on the afternoon he was killed. The\nprobative value of this evidence outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice because it best\ncaptured the emotional impact of Ley’s death on his loved ones. Admission of a\ncollection of photographs taken at a memorial service held by the bank where Ley\nworked, plus resolutions in Ley’s honor from the Missouri House of Representatives\nand the St. Louis Board of Alderman, were relevant to Ley’s “uniqueness” as a human\nbeing and the impact of his death, Payne, 501 U.S. at 823-27, and not so unduly\nprejudicial as to render the trial fundamentally unfair. Finally, a co-worker who ran\nto assist Ley when he was shot graphically described Ley’s condition and the impact\nthat experience had on the witness’s life. This was clearly admissible as the most\nprobative evidence of the effect of Bolden’s crime on his victim. It was undoubtedly\nprejudicial, but not unfairly so.\n\n        The district court placed few limits on Bolden’s mitigating evidence; he argued\nthirty-two mitigating factors to the jury. See Paul, 217 F.3d at 1002. The number of\nvictim impact witnesses alone does not establish unfair prejudice. After the sixteen\ntestified on Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning, and Wednesday morning, the jury\nheard closing arguments and instructions on Thursday. After the court’s cautionary\ninstructions regarding victim impact testimony and a recess on Friday, the jury began\ndeliberations the following Monday. It returned the verdict on Tuesday, finding all\nfive aggravating factors and many of the thirty-two mitigating factors. This timing\ndoes not suggest that the sentence was the product of passion rather than careful,\nreasoned judgment.\n\n       B. Mitigation Issues. The FDPA defines “mitigating factors” to include\n“factors in the defendant’s background, record, or character or any other circumstance\nof the offense that mitigate against imposition of the death sentence.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3592(a)(8). Here, the district court submitted thirty-two distinct mitigating factors,\ntwenty-one of which were found to exist by at least one juror. Bolden argues that the\ncourt erred by refusing to submit three additional factors: (a) “The execution of\nRobert Bolden may not necessarily alleviate the victim’s or victim’s family suffering.”\n                                          -25-\n\f(b) “Robert Bolden’s execution will cause his family great emotional pain and\ndistress.” (c) “The sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release is an\nadequate harsh alternative punishment that will protect society from further risk of\ncriminal conduct by Robert Bolden.” The court ruled that the record lacked evidence\nto support the submission of these three factors.\n\n       As to the first proposed factor, the government was precluded from eliciting\ntestimony concerning the Ley family’s desires for punishment. Parker v. Bowersox,\n188 F.3d 923, 931 (8th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1038 (2000), and cases cited.\nThus, there was no evidence about the effect of Bolden’s execution on the Ley\nfamily’s suffering. As to the second, Bolden elicited substantial testimony from his\nchildren about his positive impact on their lives, and the district court submitted seven\nmitigating factors related to Bolden’s positive impact on his family and their love for\nhim. Any additional instruction would have been duplicative. As to the third, it was\nthe province of the jury to decide whether life in prison was “an adequate harsh\npunishment” for Bolden’s crimes. The government did not submit Bolden’s future\ndangerousness as a non-statutory aggravating factor, which obviated any need for a\nmitigating instruction whether life in prison would adequately protect society from the\nrisk of future criminal conduct.\n\n       “Special instructions are necessary when the jury could not otherwise give\nmeaningful effect to a defendant’s mitigating evidence.” Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman,\n127 S. Ct. 1654, 1668 n.14 (2007) (emphasis in original). Here, in addition to\nsubmitting thirty-two factors, the district court instructed the jurors to consider any\n“mitigating factors whether or not specifically argued by defense counsel which are\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence.” There was no abuse of the court’s\nsubstantial discretion to fashion appropriate instructions.\n\n       Bolden further argues that the district court placed unconstitutional limits on his\nmitigation evidence. Prior to trial, the district court granted the government’s motion\nin limine to prevent Bolden from introducing unsworn allocution evidence during the\n                                           -26-\n\fpenalty phase without being subject to cross-examination. During the penalty phase,\nhe notified the government that mitigation witness John Wilson would testify that he\nhelped Bolden prepare a “statement of accountability” to explain his remorse to Ley’s\nfamily and friends. The government objected, and the district court ruled that Bolden\ncould not introduce the statement nor have Wilson testify about assisting Bolden in\npreparing it, as both constituted unsworn allocution. Bolden argues the court abused\nits discretion because this ruling contravened the Eighth Amendment by preventing\nhim from introducing relevant mitigation evidence.\n\n       The FDPA permits introduction of relevant mitigating evidence even if\ninadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, but “this does not mean that the\ndefense has carte blanche to introduce any and all evidence that it wishes.” Purkey,\n428 F.3d at 756. Among other limitations, the defendant “does not have a statutory\nright to make statements to a jury during the penalty phase of an FPDA trial without\nbeing subject to cross-examination.” Id. at 761. Here, the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in excluding an unsworn, unsigned, undated statement lacking any\nindicia of reliability unless the government could cross examine Bolden about its\ncreation. We also note that Bolden elicited testimony about his post-offense remorse\nfrom another mitigation witness.\n\n       C. Penalty Phase Evidentiary Issues. (1) Bolden argues that the district court\nabused its discretion by allowing the government to use a styrofoam head to illustrate\nthe trajectory of the bullets as they hit Ley during the testimony of a forensic\npathologist. Because the head was inflexible, he contends, it provided an arbitrary\nbasis for the jury to determine whether the shots were fired intentionally or\naccidentally. After obtaining assurances that the pathologist would limit her use of\nthe demonstrative exhibit, the court ruled that use of the skull would not be unfairly\nprejudicial and, alternatively, that any prejudice was outweighed by the probative\nvalue of this evidence. There was no abuse of the court’s substantial evidentiary\ndiscretion. United States v. Pirani, 406 F.3d 543, 555 (8th Cir.) (en banc) (standard\nof review), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 909 (2005).\n                                         -27-\n\f       (2) Bolden argues the district court abused its discretion by allowing the\ngovernment to ask mitigation witness Mona Muhammad if she was biased against the\ngovernment because her son was convicted of first degree murder following an\ninvestigation by two case agents who investigated Bolden. Cross exam of a penalty\nphase mitigation witness for bias is proper. Purkey, 428 F.3d at 760. Moreover, Rule\n611(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence expressly allows cross exam concerning\n“matters affecting the credibility of the witness.” We grant broad deference to the\ndistrict court’s determination of the appropriate scope of cross exam. United States\nv. Crenshaw, 359 F.3d 977, 1002 (8th Cir. 2004). Here, the inquiry did not create a\nrisk of unfair prejudice, confuse the issues, or mislead the jury. See § 3593(c).\n\n       (3) During cross exam, the government asked Bolden’s aunt if she was aware\nBolden attempted to sell his daughters back to their mother for $5,000. Bolden\nobjected before the witness could answer. After a sidebar conference, the district\ncourt sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question. On\nappeal, Bolden argues the question was improper. As the district court granted the\nrelief he requested, no issue was preserved for appellate review.\n\n       D. Penalty Phase Instruction Issue. Bolden first argues that the district\ncourt’s preliminary instruction at the start of the penalty phase concerning the possible\npenalties for his conviction on the felon-in-possession count misled the jury into\nbelieving he might not serve the rest of his life in prison if not sentenced to death.\nThis contention is frivolous. The court’s thorough final instructions at the conclusion\nof the penalty phase accurately stated the law and unambiguously instructed, with\nrespect to the bank robbery count: “if you determine that death is not justified . . . you\nmust record your determination that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment\nwithout possibility of release,” as 18 U.S.C. § 2113(e) mandates.\n\n       Bolden next argues that the district court erred in refusing to give a proffered\ninstruction reflecting his contention that, under § 3593(e), the jury is never required\nto impose a sentence of death, even if it has found that the aggravating circumstances\n                                          -28-\n\fsufficiently outweigh the mitigating circumstances to justify a death sentence. We\nhave rejected this contention in many cases. See, e.g., Allen, 247 F.3d at 779-82;\nPurkey, 428 F.3d at 762-63. The district court’s instructions were consistent with the\nFDPA as construed in these decisions. Moreover, the court’s instruction adequately\nincorporated Bolden’s contention that the jury was not required to impose a death\nsentence: “If you unanimously conclude that the aggravating factor or factors . . .\nsufficiently outweigh the mitigating factor or factors . . . and that therefore death is the\nappropriate sentence . . . you must record your determination that a sentence of death\nshall be imposed” (emphasis added).\n\n      E. The Mental State Gateway Issue. The FDPA provides that, for the\ndefendant to be eligible for a death sentence, the jury must find that he\n\n       (A) intentionally killed the victim; (B) intentionally inflicted serious\n       bodily injury that resulted in the death of the victim; (C) intentionally\n       participated in an act, contemplating that the life of a person would be\n       taken or intending that lethal force would be used . . . and the victim died\n       as a direct result of the act; or (D) intentionally . . . engaged in an act of\n       violence, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death . . . such that\n       participation . . . constituted a reckless disregard for human life and the\n       victim died as a direct result of the act.\n18 U.S.C. § 3591(a)(2). Over Bolden’s objection, the district court submitted and the\njury found that Bolden had acted with all four mental states in committing both capital\noffenses. Bolden argues that this enhanced the risk that jurors would inflate the\nweight of mental state evidence during the penalty phase. We disagree.\n\n       Numerous decisions have approved submission of multiple mental states in\nFDPA cases. See United States v. Jackson, 327 F.3d 273, 300-01 (4th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 540 U.S. 1019 (2003); United States v. Webster, 162 F.3d 308, 323-24 (5th\nCir. 1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 829 (1999); United States v. Cheever, 423 F. Supp.\n2d 1181, 1199-1200 (D. Kan. 2006); Natson, 444 F. Supp. 2d at 1308-09. We agree\nwith these decisions. Here, as in Webster, the court instructed the jury to weigh the\n\n                                           -29-\n\faggravating and mitigating factors with no mention of the “gateway” element of\nintent.14 Moreover, the verdict form segregated the mental state inquiry from the\naggravating and mitigating factors and “made clear the sequential nature of the\nprocess.” Webster, 162 F.3d at 324. Not every capital crime may support the\nsubmission of all four mental states, but the district court did not err in concluding that\nthe evidence warranted submitting all four in this case.\n\n       F. The Government’s Summation. Bolden argues that the government’s\n“incendiary” penalty phase closing argument denied him a fair trial. He objects to\nmany portions of the argument, but none of the arguments made on appeal were\npreserved with contemporaneous objections in the district court. Accordingly, our\nreview is for plain error. United States v. Robinson, 110 F.3d 1320, 1326 (8th Cir.),\ncert. denied, 522 U.S. 975 (1997). To obtain relief, Bolden must show that an error\noccurred, that it was plain, that it affected his substantial rights, and that it seriously\naffected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. To\nshow that an error affected his substantial rights, he must “demonstrate[] a reasonable\nprobability that he would have received a more favorable sentence with the . . . error\neliminated.” Pirani, 406 F.3d at 551.\n\n      Most of the arguments Bolden challenges were not improper. For example,\nBolden notes that the prosecutor repeatedly de-emphasized and belittled his proposed\nmitigating factors, but “as long as the jurors are not told to ignore or disregard\nmitigators, a prosecutor may argue, based on the circumstances of the case, that they\nare entitled to little or no weight.” Johnson, 495 F.3d at 978. The prosecutor did\n\n\n      14\n        Bolden relies on United States v. McCullah, 76 F.3d 1087, 1111-12 (10th Cir.\n1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1213 (1997). McCullah is distinguishable because it\nturned on the submission of duplicative aggravating factors that included mental state\ncomponents under 21 U.S.C. § 848(n), a different federal death penalty statute. The\nTenth Circuit has more recently held that duplication “between the gateway [intent]\nfactors and aggravating factors does not undermine the constitutional validity” of a\ndeath sentence under the FDPA. Chanthadara, 230 F.3d at 1261.\n                                         -30-\n\fimproperly ask the jury to impose the death penalty on behalf of the Ley family, an\nargument for which there was no supporting evidence. Rather than object, Bolden\nlater requested an instruction that the jury not speculate about the family’s wishes.\nThe district court gave that instruction. After careful review of all the challenged\ncomments, we conclude they were isolated and insubstantial in context and far less\negregious than statements we have deemed harmless in other capital cases. See e.g.,\nJohnson, 495 F.3d at 979-80; Ortiz, 315 F.3d at 903. We conclude there was no plain\nerror and, alternatively, that Bolden has failed to establish plain error that substantially\naffected his rights.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\nEBEL, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I concur fully in the judgment and opinion of the court.\n\n       I write separately only to address in greater detail Defendant-Appellant\nBolden’s argument pertaining to the application of one of the statutory aggravating\nfactors that the jury found in this case. Bolden argues that the statutory aggravator\nthat applies when a defendant “has previously been convicted of 2 or more State or\nFederal offenses, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year,\ncommitted on different occasions, involving the distribution of a controlled\nsubstance,” 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(10), does not apply to him. Bolden concedes that he\nhas one such conviction for distributing cocaine. But Bolden argues that the second\nconviction on which the Government relied—a 1993 Michigan conviction for\nattempted possession of drugs with the intent to distribute—does not qualify.\n\n       Of course, possession of drugs with the intent to distribute is a crime “involving\nthe distribution of a controlled substance.” See United States v. Matra, 841 F.2d 837,\n843 (8th Cir. 1988), abrogated on other grounds, United States v. McKinney, 120 F.3d\n132, 133 (8th Cir. 1997). It is, however, a more difficult issue whether this statutory\n                                          -31-\n\faggravator includes a conviction for the attempt to possess drugs with the intent to\ndistribute.\n\n       There is, as far as I can tell, no published case law interpreting and applying this\nstatutory aggravating factor. The language of this aggravator is certainly broad\nenough to include attempts to commit the crime of distribution of a controlled\nsubstance because it contains the very inclusive word “involving”—“involving the\ndistribution of a controlled substance.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n       Further support for the inclusion of attempted possession with the intent to\ndistribute drugs in this aggravator may be found in the Supreme Court’s reasoning in\nJames v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 127 S. Ct. 1586 (2007). James applied, not the\nFederal Death Penalty Act (“FDPA”), but the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”),\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e). See 127 S. Ct. at 1590. Nevertheless, the ACCA provides a\nrelevant analogy to the case here because the ACCA similarly includes statutory\nprovisions that expressly include attempt offenses, and those that do not. In particular,\nthe ACCA defines a violent felony under that Act to include\n\n      any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\n      year . . . that—\n\n             (I) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened\n             use of physical force against the person of another; or\n\n             (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n             explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\n             serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Like the FDPA’s statutory aggravators,\nthe ACCA thus expressly includes attempt offenses in one section, but does not\nmention them in the very next section of the statute. Nevertheless, the James Court\nrejected the argument that, because Congress expressly included attempts in one\n                                           -32-\n\fsection, attempt offenses could not be included in the next section. See James, 127\nS. Ct. at 1591-92. In its discussion of this issue, James concluded in dicta that the\nstatutory language addressing an offense that “involves use of explosives” is broad\nenough to include an attempt offense: “An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a\ngovernment building . . . would involve the use of explosives.”15 Id. at 1592\n(quotation, alterations omitted).\n\n       But when one considers the whole of the statutory aggravating factors set forth\nin the FDPA, an argument can be made that § 3592(c)(10) does not encompass a\nconviction for the attempt to possess drugs with the intent to distribute. Of the sixteen\nstatutory aggravating factors available under § 3592(c), four aggravators expressly\ninclude attempted offenses. See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(1) (“The death, or injury\nresulting in death, occurred during the commission or attempted commission of, or\nduring the immediate flight from the commission of” one of twenty enumerated\nfederal felonies.) (emphasis added); id. § 3592(c)(2) (“[T]he defendant has previously\nbeen convicted of a Federal or State offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of\nmore than 1 year, involving the use or attempted or threatened use of a\nfirearm . . . against another person.”) (emphasis added); id. § 3592(c)(4) (“The\ndefendant has previously been convicted of 2 or more Federal or State offenses,\npunishable by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, committed on different\noccasions, involving the infliction of, or attempted infliction of, serious bodily injury\nor death upon another person.”) (emphasis added); id. § 3592(c)(16) (“The defendant\n\n\n      15\n        The specific issue James addressed was whether a prior conviction for\nattempted burglary was a violent felony under the ACCA. See 127 S. Ct. at 1590. In\nthat case, the parties agreed that attempted burglary did not fall within either\n§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i) or § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s enumerated offense of burglary. See James,\n127 S. Ct. at 1591. The James Court held that attempted burglary fell within\n§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s residual language as an offense that “otherwise involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” See James, 127\nS. Ct. at 1593-98. In reaching this conclusion, James noted the breadth of the\nlanguage of that residual clause. See id. at 1597-98.\n                                          -33-\n\fintentionally killed or attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal\nepisode.”) (emphasis added). The language specifically including attempts in these\nfour statutory aggravating factors and the conspicuous absence of attempt in the other\naggravators suggests that Congress knew how to include attempt offenses when it\nintended to do so.16\n\n       Moreover, two of these aggravators, 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(2) and (4),\nspecifically use both the terms “involving” and “attempt” together in the same\nprovision. This further suggests that Congress did not intend its use of the word\n“involving” automatically to include attempt offenses.\n\n       “The long established plain language rule of statutory construction requires\nexamining the text of the statute as a whole by considering its context, object, and\npolicy.” United States v. Boesen, 541 F.3d 838, 846 (8th Cir. 2008) (quotation\nomitted). “Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but\nomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts\nintentionally and purposefully in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.” Russello v.\nUnited States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (quotation, alteration omitted); see also United\nStates v. Sampson, 335 F. Supp. 2d 166, 212-14 (D. Mass. 2004) (applying FDPA and\nconcluding that, because Congress required that the defendant act knowingly in order\nfor some of the statutory aggravators to apply, but did not expressly include a\n\n\n      16\n         Congress wrote two other statutory aggravating factors using language broad\nenough to encompass convictions for both attempted and completed offenses. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(3) (“The defendant has previously been convicted of another\nFederal or State offense resulting in the death of a person, for which a sentence of life\nimprisonment or a sentence of death was authorized by statute.”); id. § 3592(c)(12)\n(“The defendant had previously been convicted of violating title II or III of the\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 for which a sentence\nof 5 or more years may be imposed or had previously been convicted of engaging in\na continuing criminal enterprise.”). Congress chose not to draft the aggravating factor\nat issue here in that same fashion.\n                                          -34-\n\fknowledge requirement in 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(11), applying when the victim was\n“particularly vulnerable due to old age, youth, or infirmity,” Congress did not then\nintend to require proof that the defendant knew that his victim was vulnerable before\nthat aggravating factor could apply).\n\n       But it is not apparent to me why Congress would expressly include attempt\noffenses in some of the FDPA’s statutory aggravating factors, but not others. And\nneither party points us to any legislative history that might better explain this seeming\ninconsistency. It may be that Congress intended to include attempts when the offenses\nat issue were particularly serious as, for example, offenses involving violence and\nweapons. But Congress has also often indicated that drug trafficking is serious\ncriminal conduct. On the other hand, the difference in terminology could be explained\nby the fact that the statutory aggravators in § 3592 were often lifted from other\npre-existing statutes, and additional aggravators were added to this section over the\nyears. Thus, the various aggravators often come from different sources and their\ndifferent language may simply be a consequence of this mixed pedigree with no actual\nsignificance intended by Congress between various phraseologies used.\n\n        Where a criminal statute is ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to give the\ndefendant the benefit of the doubt. See United States v. Santos, 128 S. Ct. 2020, 2025\n(2008) (plurality) (noting that, “[u]nder a long line of our decisions, the tie must go\nto the defendant. The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted\nin favor of the defendants subjected to them”). And the rule of lenity “applies to\nsentencing as well as substantive [criminal statutory] provisions.” Rowe v. Lockhart,\n736 F.2d 457, 461 (8th Cir. 1984); see United States v. Allen, 247 F.3d 741, 767, 769\n(8th Cir. 2001) (discussing rule of lenity in addressing claim that multiple sentences\nof life in prison and death for the same underlying offense amounted to double\njeopardy, but concluding rule of lenity did not apply in that case), cert. granted and\njudgment vacated, 536 U.S. 953 (2002); cf. Rowe, 736 F.2d at 460-62 (discussing rule\nof lenity, but not applying it in that case to overturn thirty-year sentence for attempted\ncapital murder).\n                                             -35-\n\f       Nevertheless, I am ultimately persuaded that § 3592(c)(10) is not ambiguous,\nand that that aggravating factor does encompass Bolden’s prior conviction for the\nattempted possession of drugs with the intent to distribute, for several reasons. First,\nno persuasive reason is apparent to me why Congress would have intentionally desired\nto exclude attempts under § 3592(c)(10) but to include attempts under many of the\nother aggravators. Thus, to give meaning to the differences in language between the\nvarious aggravators in § 3592(c) would be rank speculation. I do not believe rank\nspeculation should trump the language of § 3592(c) standing alone. Second, James,\nin a different context, indicated that the fact that Congress expressly included\nattempted offenses in one subsection of a statute but not in another subsection did not\nmean that attempted convictions could not be included in a subsection lacking an\nexpress reference to attempt. See 127 S. Ct. at 1591-92. Third, the language\nCongress used in § 3592(c)(10)—prior convictions “involving the distribution of a\ncontrolled substance” (emphasis added)—is very broad language that would naturally\nencompass attempts to possess a controlled substance with the intent to distribute.\nIndeed, as James made clear, the word “involving” has explicitly been applied to\ninclude attempts. In James, the Court in dicta said that an unsuccessful attempt to\nblow up a government building would constitute a violent felony under the clause in\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) that reads, “involves the use of explosives.”\n\n      For these reasons, I agree that § 3592(c)(10) encompassed Bolden’s prior\nconviction for the attempted possession of drugs with the intent to distribute.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\f",

After a month-long trial, a federal jury convicted\nBolden of killing Ley with a firearm during an attempted bank robbery, conspiracy to\ncommit bank robbery, and being a felon-in-possession of a firearm. The jury\nsentenced him to death for the bank robbery-murder and firearm offenses. See 18\n\n\n\n      *\n      The HONORABLE DAVID M.

Bolden appeals, arguing the district court1 committed\nsome thirty reversible errors prior to and during trial. We will first address the three\nissues emphasized at oral argument. After careful review of the record, we affirm.\n\n                                   I. Background\n\n       Dominick Price testified that, on the morning of October 7, 2002, Bolden asked\nPrice to help rob a Bank of America branch because Bolden needed $2,000 to avoid\nbeing evicted from his home. As the two “cased” the bank, Bolden told a hesitant\nPrice his plan: Bolden would brandish his handgun and disarm the guard outside the\nbank, then Bolden and Price would take the guard into the bank as a hostage, demand\nmoney, and drive away in Bolden’s car. The two men purchased nylon stocking caps,\nand Bolden recruited a third man, Corteze Edwards, to assist in the robbery.\n\n       Early that afternoon, the trio dressed in dark clothing and drove to a parking lot\nnear the bank. Price and Edwards wore masks. Bolden did not. When bank guard\nLey walked out of the bank, Bolden approached on foot, with Price and Edwards\nfifteen-to-twenty feet behind. Price testified that Bolden stopped a short distance from\nLey and pointed his handgun at the guard. After a brief dialog, Ley reached for the\ngun, and they struggled. Bolden regained control of the gun and shot Ley in the jaw.\nAs Ley fell, Bolden took a step back and fired another shot into Ley’s head. Ley died\nfrom the second wound later that afternoon. The three robbers ran off, shedding\nclothing as they ran. Many bystanders witnessed the shooting. One saw Bolden drive\naway, and he was arrested that evening. Clothing found near the bank tested positive\nfor traces of DNA from Bolden, Price, and Edwards. A later search of Bolden’s home\nuncovered the handgun used to kill Ley and ammunition matching that found during\nLey’s autopsy.\n\n\n      1\n        The HONORABLE CAROL E.

A Batson Challenge\n\n       Before trial, the government used a peremptory challenge to strike prospective\njuror number 44, an African American woman. Bolden argued the strike violated\nBatson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), which held that it is a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause for the government to use a peremptory challenge to strike a\nprospective juror solely on the basis of race. After the district court ruled that Bolden\nestablished a prima facie case of discrimination, the government claimed that it struck\njuror 44 for a race-neutral ground -- because, when asked to elaborate on her\nquestionnaire response that the criminal justice system should use legal students for\nresearch, she explained that she believed based on twelve years of legal training that\nusing legal students for research would assist the criminal justice system. The\ngovernment expressed concern that she might give more weight to her legal training\nthan is warranted and that there was no way to know how this experience might affect\nthe deliberation process.2\n\n       The district court found that this was a race-neutral reason, comparing the strike\nof juror 44 with the government’s strike of juror 142, a white high school teacher who\nsaid he often discussed constitutional law issues with his students. The court rejected\nBolden’s assertion that juror 44 should be compared with non-stricken white juror\n176, a deputy clerk for a Missouri court who stated in her questionnaire that her\n“passion is to see criminals convicted,” and that she has a favorable view of the court\nsystem based upon her son’s fair treatment for pending drug related charges. The\ncourt’s ultimate finding was that Bolden failed to prove that the strike of juror 44 was\nmotivated by race discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The government also claimed that an Assistant United States Attorney may\nhave offended juror 44 when he addressed her by the wrong name. The district court\ndid not credit this reason.\n\n                                          -3-\n\f       On appeal, Bolden argues the district court clearly erred when it denied his\nBatson challenge because the government’s purported race-neutral reason for striking\njuror 44 was implausible. We review the court’s Batson rulings for clear error,\nkeeping in mind that “the ultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation\nrests with, and never shifts from the party opposing the strike.” Purkett v.

After\ncareful review of the questionnaire responses and voir dire testimony, and giving the\ndistrict court’s findings the “great deference” Batson requires, 476 U.S. at 98 n.21, we\nconclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government stated\na race-neutral reason for striking juror 44 that was adequately supported by the record.\nCompare United States v.

Statutory Aggravating Factors\n\n       The Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 (“FDPA”) provides that, if the\ndefendant has been found guilty of a homicide offense for which the death penalty\nmay be imposed, the trial judge “shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing to\ndetermine the punishment to be imposed.” 18 U.S.C. § 3593(b). At this hearing,\n“information may be presented as to any matter relevant to the sentence, including any\nmitigating or aggravating factor,” regardless of its admissibility under the Federal\nRules of Evidence. § 3593(c). The jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt at least\none of sixteen “aggravating factors” before it may impose the death penalty; the\ngovernment has the burden of proving “any aggravating factor . . . beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” Id. The defendant has the burden of proving “any mitigating\nfactor . . . by a preponderance of the evidence.” Id. The jury then considers “all the\ninformation received during the hearing,” and returns “special findings” identifying\nthe statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors it has unanimously found to exist,\nand the mitigating factors that one or more jurors have found to exist. If no statutory\naggravating factor is found beyond a reasonable doubt, “the court shall impose a\n\n                                           -4-\n\fsentence other than death.” § 3593(d). If the jury instead finds the requisite mental\nstate and one or more statutory aggravating factors, then it “shall consider whether all\nthe aggravating factor or factors found to exist sufficiently outweigh all the mitigating\nfactor or factors found to exist to justify a sentence of death” and, based upon this\nconsideration, recommend by unanimous vote “whether the defendant should be\nsentenced to death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other\nlesser sentence.” § 3593(e).\n\n       Bolden’s superseding indictment alleged and the jury found two aggravating\nfactors, “pecuniary gain” and “conviction for two felony drug offenses.” See\n§§ 3592(c)(8), (10). Bolden challenges those findings on multiple grounds.3\n\n        A. Pecuniary Gain. Committing a homicide “as consideration for the receipt,\nor in the expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value” is an aggravating\nfactor. 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(8). In this case, the district court instructed the jury only\non the second clause -- the government must prove that Bolden “committed the\nkilling or murder in the expectation of anything in the form of money, property, or\nanything else having some economic value, benefit or advantage.” Emphasizing the\nfirst clause, Bolden argues that the pecuniary gain factor only applies to a murder-for-\nhire. He urges us to read subsection (c)(8) in tandem with subsection (c)(7), which\napplies to a defendant who “procured the commission of the offense by payment, or\npromise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value.”\n\n\n\n\n      3\n        Bolden also argues that the district court should have dismissed the indictment\nbecause the government misled the grand jury concerning the evidence of these\naggravating factors. We disagree. This allegation of prosecutorial misconduct during\nthe grand jury proceedings was rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by the\npetit jury’s guilty verdict. United States v. Sanders, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783356\"><a href=\"/opinion/783356/united-states-of-america-cross-appellantappellee-v-james-randall/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818-19 (8th Cir.\n2003), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1227</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).\n\n                                          -5-\n\f       Bolden did not raise this issue in the district court, so our review is for plain\nerror. At least five other circuits agree that § 3592(c)(8) applies, not only to murder-\nfor-hire, but also when the murder itself, and not just an underlying offense such as\nrobbery, was committed with the expectation of pecuniary gain. As the Eleventh\nCircuit explained, “The ‘consideration’ and ‘expectation’ clauses are two separate\nways by which the pecuniary gain factor may be satisfied, and they both must have\nmeaning.” United States v.

There was no\nplain error.\n\n       Bolden next contends that, even if § 3592(c)(8) may apply to some bank\nrobbers, there was insufficient evidence that he killed Ley in the expectation of\npecuniary gain, rather than to eliminate an eyewitness and to escape from a botched\nrobbery. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an aggravating\nfactor, we “consider whether any rational trier of fact could have found the\naggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt.” Ortiz, 315 F.3d at 902.\n\n       We agree with Bolden that the pecuniary gain factor applies to a killing during\nthe course of a bank robbery only “where pecuniary gain is expected to follow as a\ndirect result of the murder.” Bernard, 299 F.3d at 483; see Mitchell, 502 F.3d at 975;\nBrown, 441 F.3d at 1370-71. Bolden relies heavily on Bernard, but in that case\ndefendants killed the victims after a completed robbery and carjacking solely to\neliminate them as witnesses. 299 F.3d at 472-73, 483-84. Here, by contrast, Bolden\n\n                                          -6-\n\fbrought a loaded handgun to the bank planning to confront the bank guard before\nrobbing the bank. Price testified that, when he and Bolden returned to his house after\nthe failed robbery, Bolden “was mad that . . . we didn’t complete the bank robbery,”\nsaid “that the guard was stupid,” and referred to the event as a “wasted trip.” These\nstatements were sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that Bolden shot Ley to\nremove an obstacle to completing the robbery and that his intention was to continue\nwith the robbery once Ley had been removed. Thus, the killing was committed in the\nexpectation of receiving pecuniary gain. 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(8). Bolden also told\nPrice, “it was either shoot the guard or spend the rest of his life in jail.” But the statute\ndoes not require that pecuniary gain be the only motive for a murder.\n\n       Finally, Bolden argues that the pecuniary gain instruction allowed the jury to\nfind this factor based solely on his motive for the underlying robbery because the\ndistrict court refused to charge that pecuniary gain “was expected to follow as a direct\nresult of the murder.” The court instead instructed:\n\n       To establish that a defendant committed the killing or murder in the\n       expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value, the\n       government must prove that the defendant committed the killing or\n       murder in the expectation of anything in the form of money, property, or\n       anything else having some economic value, benefit or advantage.\n\nThis instruction accurately stated the law. Moreover, by substituting “the killing or\nmurder” for the reference to “the offense” in § 3592(c)(8), the instruction made clear\nthat the jury could not find this aggravating factor based solely on Bolden’s attempt\nto rob the bank for pecuniary gain. See Chanthadara, 230 F.3d at 1263-64. The\ndistrict court did not abuse its wide discretion in formulating this instruction. See\nUnited States v. Phelps, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762072\"><a href=\"/opinion/762072/united-states-v-randy-phelps/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1057 (8th Cir. 1999) (standard of review).\n\n      B. Prior Drug Distribution Offenses. The jury also found a second statutory\naggravating factor, that Bolden was previously convicted of two or more felony\n\n                                            -7-\n\foffenses “committed on different occasions, involving the distribution of a controlled\nsubstance.” § 3592(c)(10). Bolden concedes that the government established one\nprior offense, a 1995 Michigan conviction for delivery of cocaine. But he contends\nthat the second offense on which the government relied, a 1993 Michigan conviction\nfor “attempted possession with intent to deliver cocaine,” was not an offense\n“involving the distribution of a controlled substance.” He argues, without citation to\ncase law or legislative history, that “Congress did not use the term ‘involving’ to\nencompass convictions based on mere ‘attempts’ or ‘intents.’” The government\nresponds that the term, “offenses . . . involving distribution,” is not limited to actual\ndistribution offenses; it should be read to include offenses where drug distribution was\nattempted but thwarted by police intervention. In this case, for example, the\ngovernment introduced the transcript of Bolden’s 1993 guilty plea hearing at which\nhe expressly admitted that he had intended to sell at least some of the crack cocaine\nfound in his possession.\n\n       Reviewing the district court’s interpretation of statutory aggravating factors de\nnovo, we agree with the government.

Likewise, we conclude, the term “involving the distribution of a\ncontrolled substance” in § 3592(c)(10) includes attempt offenses. Bolden’s contention\nthat the word “involving” in § 3592(c)(10) should be construed as excluding attempt\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\foffenses because the aggravating factors in §§ 3592(c)(2) and (4) expressly include\nattempt offenses is unpersuasive.4\n\n        Bolden further argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting\ntestimony by a Michigan police officer detailing suspected drug trafficking activity\nthat preceded Bolden’s 1993 arrest and conviction for “attempted possession with\nintent to distribute cocaine.” Bolden argues this permitted the jury to find the\n§ 3592(c)(10) factor based upon uncharged conduct. (He does not argue that the\nevidence was insufficient to support this finding or that the court erred in instructing\nthe jury.)

There was no abuse of discretion in admitting this\nevidence.\n\n      Finally, Bolden argues that § 3592(c)(10) is unconstitutional as applied in this\ncase because prior remote nonviolent drug offenses do not rationally narrow the class\nof death-eligible defendants, as required by Zant, 462 U.S. at 877 & n.15. We\ndisagree. Bolden cites no case in which a court invalidated a death-eligibility factor\nbecause it failed to identify prior conduct of sufficient gravity. In Allen, 247 F.3d at\n\n\n      4\n       The James Court construed “involves use of explosives” in § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\nas including the crime of attempt even though § 924(e)(2)(B)(i), the immediately\npreceding subsection, expressly includes prior attempt convictions.\n      5\n       18 U.S.C. § 3593(c) provides: “[I]nformation may be presented as to any\nmatter relevant to the sentence . . . . regardless of its admissibility under the rules\ngoverning admission of evidence at criminal trials except that information may be\nexcluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair\nprejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.”\n\n                                          -9-\n\f761, we held that the FDPA statutory factors “adequately narrow[] the class of persons\neligible for the death penalty,” observing that “how broadly or how narrowly the death\npenalty should be applied as a punishment, if at all, is essentially a political choice left\nto the people’s elected representatives in the legislative and executive branches.”\nCongress has repeatedly enacted severe sentencing enhancements for recidivist drug\ntraffickers. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b). We conclude that § 3592(c)(10) identifies\ncircumstances that reasonably justify imposition of a more severe sentence for\nmurder.6\n\n                            IV. Penalty Phase Bifurcation\n\n         As the plain language of §§ 3593(b)-(e) summarized at the start of Part III\nmakes clear, the FDPA contemplates a single penalty phase hearing at which all\nrelevant evidence is admitted and, if the defendant is found eligible for the death\npenalty, ultimately weighed by the jury. A number of district courts have nonetheless\ngranted pre-hearing motions to bifurcate the penalty phase (or, as some have phrased\nit, “trifurcate” the entire trial) into an “eligibility phase,” limited to evidence relevant\nto mental state and to the existence of one or more statutory aggravating factors, and,\nif the defendant is found eligible, a “selection phase,” at which evidence relevant to\nmitigating factors and non-statutory aggravating factors such as victim impact and\nother crimes is received and weighed by the jury. See, e.g., United States v. Natson,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2328847\"><a href=\"/opinion/2328847/united-states-v-natson/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We may not “reverse\nor vacate a sentence of death on account of . . . any erroneous special finding of an\naggravating factor, where the Government establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe error was harmless.” § 3595(c)(2). As the evidence relevant to the Michigan drug\nconvictions was admissible in any event and the jury could have given this evidence\naggravating weight under the non-statutory aggravating factor “other criminal\nconduct,” any error in submitting this statutory factor was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.

He argued that the government’s evidence of other crimes was relevant only\nto a non-statutory aggravating factor but would invite the jury to resolve the eligibility\nissues, his mental state and the alleged statutory aggravating factors, based on his bad\ncharacter as evidenced by his criminal history. The district court denied the motion,\nexplaining that the jury would follow the court’s eligibility instructions. On appeal,\nBolden argues this issue very differently, asserting that the government’s extensive\nvictim impact evidence “enhanced the risk” that the jury would find him eligible for\ndeath despite the government’s weak proof of either statutory aggravating factor. He\nprovides no citation to the voluminous record establishing that he made this argument\nto the district court, either before or during the sentencing hearing.\n\n         The government argues that bifurcation is statutorily impermissible.7 The only\ncircuit to address this issue under the FDPA concluded that the statute contemplates\nbut does not require a single penalty phase proceeding and encouraged district courts\nruling on motions to trifurcate “to consider carefully the ramifications of presenting\n. . . evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible in the guilt phase . . . to a jury that\nhas not yet made findings concerning death eligibility.” United States v. Fell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2606\"><a href=\"/opinion/2606/united-states-v-fell/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 n.28 (2d Cir. 2008). We agree that is a sound reading of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       We note the government requested bifurcation in Jordan, 357 F. Supp. 2d at\n903, to ensure the jury would consider at the selection phase hearsay evidence that\nmight be inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause at the eligibility phase.\n\n                                           -11-\n\f       As no case has held that bifurcation is mandatory, we think it obvious that the\nruling on a motion to bifurcate the penalty phase of an FDPA proceeding is reviewed\nfor abuse of discretion. Such a motion should not be routinely granted because it\nfurther extends and complicates what is already a long and complicated proceeding.\nMoreover, as this case illustrates, penalty phase evidence such as prior crimes may be\nrelevant to both statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors. See 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3592(c)(2)-(4), (10), (12), (15). In such cases, the risk of improper spillover will\nbe negligible if the jury is properly instructed and is in any event outweighed by the\nrisk of unnecessary protraction and confusion.\n\n      Bolden moved to bifurcate based on the risk that other crimes evidence would\nprejudice the jury’s consideration of eligibility issues. Bolden does not argue that risk\non appeal. Instead, he argues that the government’s victim impact evidence\n“enhanced the risk,” an issue not pursued in the district court. In its final penalty\nphase instructions, the court carefully instructed the jury:\n\n      You many not consider the victim impact evidence in deciding the\n      preliminary issues of whether the defendant is at least 18 years old,\n      whether he acted with a mental state listed in Instruction No. 3, or\n      whether any statutory aggravating circumstances in Instruction No. 4\n      exists beyond a reasonable doubt. If you make the findings on those\n      three preliminary issues which are required before the death penalty can\n      be considered, you many consider the victim impact evidence . . . . You\n      may not, however, permit the victim impact testimony to overwhelm\n      your ability to follow the law.\n\nJurors are presumed to follow their instructions, and there is no indication in the\nrecord that they did not do so.

Other Pretrial Issues\n\n       A. Motion To Suppress. At a proffer interview in January 2003, Price told\ninvestigators that Bolden hid the handgun used to shoot Ley under a gutter behind\nBolden’s rented residence. FBI Agent Terrence McGinnis left the interview, drove\nto the residence, and entered the backyard. He saw a white plastic bag peeking out\nfrom under a gutter, removed the bag, and found the murder weapon, a loaded .22\ncaliber revolver. Bolden argues the district court should have suppressed the handgun\nbecause it was found during a warrantless search of his residence conducted without\nthe consent of Bolden or his landlord. The district court denied the motion to suppress\nfor lack of standing, that is, a subjective expectation of privacy in the exterior of his\nformer residence that was objectively reasonable.

Bolden argued that the landlord’s history of forgiving his rent deficiencies\nand the fact that eviction notices were returned undelivered gave him a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in the premises. The district court disagreed, noting that\nBolden knew he was facing eviction before killing Ley, yet made no attempt to\nprevent eviction and asserted no continuing possessory interest in the residence after\nhis arrest:\n\n      [T]he defendant’s lack of any possessory interest in the premises at the\n      time of the search, his failure to exclude others from entering the\n      premises, and his failure to take precautions to maintain privacy support\n      the conclusion that the defendant had no subjective expectation of\n      privacy and that no such expectation was objectively reasonable.\n\n                                          -13-\n\fThe court’s finding that Bolden had no subjective expectation of privacy is not clearly\nerroneous. See Kiser, 948 F.2d at 423 (standard of review).

The motion to suppress was properly denied.\n\n      B. Motion To Quash a Venire Panel. During voir dire, the district court asked\nwhether any member of one panel had read or heard anything about Bolden’s alleged\ncrime. Prospective juror 168 responded:\n\n      Close friend of mine works with the victim’s aunt. And when I was\n      telling him about my jury duty here, he told me what she had told him\n      about what happened and the family’s wishes and things like that.\n\nHe later stated, “I think what [my friend] told me may influence my decision . . .\n[p]ossibly in the second phase, if there was a second phase.” Bolden made no\ncontemporaneous objection but later moved to quash the entire panel. The district\ncourt denied the motion, noting the panel could not infer from 168’s statement that\nLey’s family favored the death penalty. The court struck 168 for cause. It later\ninstructed the jury:\n\n      You are not to be influenced by the speculation concerning what\n      sentence you think the victim’s family might wish to see imposed on the\n      defendant. There is no evidence before you concerning what opinions\n      the members of the victim’s family might have on what sentence is\n      imposed. Indeed, there is no evidence that the family members of the\n      victim have any opinions on the issue at all.\n\n       On appeal Bolden argues the district court erred in refusing to quash the panel,\nan issue we review for abuse of discretion. We agree with the district court that juror\n168’s ambiguous, unsolicited statement did not so infect the panel with possible bias\n\n                                         -14-\n\fas to require that it be quashed. Bolden’s counsel spent portions of the next three days\nexhaustively questioning each potential juror for bias and preconceptions. Moreover,\nstriking juror 168 for cause and cautioning the jury not to speculate about what\nsentence Ley’s family might want were adequate protections against possible\nimproper prejudice.

The district court denied the motion, concluding that Bolden would not be\nprejudiced by the joinder because a stipulation ensured that the jury would know only\nthe fact of his prior felony convictions, not the facts underlying those convictions, see\nOld Chief v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118074\"><a href=\"/opinion/118074/old-chief-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186-92 (1997), and because the court would\ninstruct the jury to consider each count separately.\n\n        Bolden argues the court abused its discretion by denying separate trials. This\ncontention is without merit. As the district court noted, we have repeatedly upheld the\ndenial of this motion when the parties have entered into such a stipulation. See United\nStates v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"708203\"><a href=\"/opinion/708203/united-states-v-john-russell-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 980 (8th Cir. 1995), and case cited, cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996).

Testimony of Dominick Price. Bolden challenges three evidentiary rulings\narising out of government witness Price’s testimony. First, he contends that the\ndistrict court prejudicially limited cross-examination. On direct exam, Price testified\n                                           -15-\n\fthat he and Edwards were childhood friends and Bolden persuaded the two younger\nmen to assist in the bank robbery. During cross exam, Price admitted he saw Edwards\nin jail after their arrest and the two men fought. Bolden’s counsel asked Price to\nelaborate, the government objected, and the district court sustained the objection,\nexplaining that the three men voluntarily committed the crime and it was irrelevant\nwhether Edwards and Price later became enemies while in jail. Bolden argues the\ncourt abused its discretion because this testimony would have impeached Price’s\ncredibility and the government’s attempt to portray Price as remorseful.8\n\n       “We will not reverse a trial court’s decision to limit cross-examination absent\na clear abuse of discretion and a showing of prejudice to the defendant.” United\nStates v.

As the district court noted, the relationship between Price and\nEdwards after the crime was not relevant to Bolden’s guilt or his role in the offense.\nThus, the question is whether a reasonable jury would have gained a significantly\ndifferent impression of Price’s credibility had the court allowed Bolden to pursue the\nproposed line of cross-examination. United States v. Beckman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769887\"><a href=\"/opinion/769887/united-states-v-bruce-a-beckman-united-states-of-america-v-thomas-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524\n(8th Cir. 2000). A review of the record persuades us that the answer to this question\nis no. Bolden’s cross exam of Price was extensive (102 pages of the trial transcript).\nThe jury heard about Price’s drug dealings with Bolden and others, and Price’s prior\narrests for disturbing the peace, petty larceny, motor vehicle theft, assault, disturbing\nthe peace, and unlawful use of a firearm. There was no clear abuse of discretion.\n\n       Second, Bolden argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying\nhis request for re-cross exam regarding possible coaching Price may have received\nduring an observed conversation with government counsel, or while the government’s\ncase agent was together with Price in a holding cell. Government counsel explained\n\n\n      8\n       His argument that this testimony was also relevant to penalty-phase issues was\nnot preserved in the district court and cannot survive plain error review.

Counsel explained that the case agent was in the holding cell\nonly because there was a problem removing Price’s shackles. When Bolden’s counsel\nwas unable to point out discrepancies between Price’s direct and redirect testimony,\nor instances when his memory appeared to be refreshed or his answers shaded, the\ndistrict court denied the request. There was no abuse of the court’s wide discretion\nto restrict re-cross exam, particularly when new matters have not been raised on\nredirect. United States v. Ball, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1363108\"><a href=\"/opinion/1363108/united-states-v-ball/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 897 (8th Cir. 2007).\n\n       Finally, Bolden argues that the district court erred by allowing Price to testify\nto a legal conclusion. During cross exam, Price testified:\n\n      [Defense counsel]: And didn’t you decide that you, Robert, and Corteze\n      were going to split the money? Whatever was taken, was going to be\n      split three ways?\n\n      [Price]: Equally, yes.\n\n      [Counsel]: Yes. All of you were going to be treated equally?\n\n      [Price]: Yes, sir.\n\n      [Counsel]: Because you were all equal participants?\n\n      [Price]: Yes, sir.\n\nOn redirect, government counsel referred to this exchange and asked Price whether\nhe was an equal participant in the shooting of Ley. The district court overruled\nBolden’s objection that the question called for a legal conclusion, and Price answered,\n“no.” On appeal, Bolden argues that this opinion testimony improperly allowed the\ngovernment to negate two statutory mitigating circumstances, that an equally culpable\nco-defendant would not be punished by death, and that neither Price nor Edwards\nwould serve a death sentence or a life sentence for the offense.\n                                         -17-\n\f       Opinion testimony by a lay witness is not per se inadmissible, even if it\naddresses an ultimate issue. Fed. R. Evid. 701, 704(a). Here, the government’s\ninquiry was a fair response to the testimony elicited on cross exam because it\naddressed the distinction between being “equal participants” in the planned robbery\nand in the unplanned murder of Ley. “The trial court does not abuse its discretion by\nallowing the use of evidence on redirect examination to clarify an issue that was\nopened up by the defense on cross-examination -- even when this evidence would\notherwise be inadmissible.” United States v. Braidlow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480229\"><a href=\"/opinion/480229/united-states-v-ernest-braidlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 783 (8th Cir.\n1986). Moreover, the question did not elicit an improper legal opinion. While the\ndefense was no doubt pursuing a legal question, equal culpability, Price was testifying\nfrom the lay perspective of equal sharing or participation. When the government went\nfurther and asked Price whether he deserved the death penalty for his role in the crime,\nthe district court halted the inquiry. There was no abuse of the district court’s wide\ndiscretion to control the scope of redirect examination. Braidlow, 806 F.2d at 783\n(standard of review).\n\n        C. Agent McGinnis’s Notes. Prior to trial, the district court ordered that\ngovernment agents retain any rough notes that might concern Bolden’s case, and the\ngovernment agreed to provide Bolden with exculpatory information and any promises\nmade in exchange for witness testimony. See generally Giglio v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108471\"><a href=\"/opinion/108471/giglio-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972). At trial, FBI agent McGinnis testified that he took notes during the\nportion of Price’s proffer interview he attended before proceeding to Bolden’s\nresidence, which contradicted the government’s pretrial claim that only two Assistant\nUnited States Attorneys took notes during the proffer. Defense counsel complained\nthat, in failing to turn over McGinnis’s notes, the government violated both Brady v.\nMaryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963), and the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500(b). Government\ncounsel represented that he had not known the notes existed, had now reviewed the\nnotes, and concluded they contained no Brady materials. The district court ruled that\nBolden did not make a sufficient showing that the notes contained Brady or Jencks\nAct materials. Bolden challenges that ruling on appeal.\n\n                                         -18-\n\f       (1) To establish a Brady violation, Bolden must show that the prosecution\nsuppressed material evidence favorable to the defense. United States v. Van Brocklin,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741804\"><a href=\"/opinion/741804/united-states-v-darrell-dean-van-brocklin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 594 (8th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1122</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).

Bolden argues the notes might contain exculpatory\ninformation because there was a discrepancy between McGinnis’s testimony at a\npretrial hearing and his testimony at trial concerning whether Bolden told Price the\ngun was hidden under a gutter at Bolden’s residence. Review of the notes, Bolden\nargues, might have impeached Price’s trial testimony and “bolstered doubts that\nBolden was the gunman.” However, the alleged discrepancy is based upon a portion\nof McGinnis’s cross exam during the pretrial hearing. McGinnis clarified the point\nduring redirect. Thus, viewed in total, McGinnis’s pretrial and trial testimony were\nconsistent. Bolden further argues that the notes could have exposed Price’s\nmotivations for testifying but offers no support for this supposition. The government\ndisclosed all promises it made to Price in exchange for his cooperation, and defense\ncounsel thoroughly cross-examined Price on the subject. Bolden failed to show that\nthe government suppressed material exculpatory evidence.9\n\n       (2) As relevant here, the Jencks Act requires the government to produce, on\nmotion of the defendant after a government witness has testified, “a written statement\nmade by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him” relating\nto the witness’s testimony. 18 U.S.C. § 3500(e)(1). Here, McGinnis testified his\nnotes contained only statements made by Price. Thus, the notes were not a “statement\nmade by said witness,” and Bolden made no showing that Price signed the notes or\n\n\n      9\n        With little elaboration, Bolden also argues the government should have\nprovided all rough notes from police interviews of persons who witnessed the\nshooting. This argument is without merit. He made no showing that any rough\ninterview notes even existed. Van Brocklin, 115 F.3d at 595.\n                                       -19-\n\fotherwise approved them. See United States v.

Accordingly, the district court correctly ruled that the notes were not subject\nto review under the Jencks Act. See United States v. New, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"798172\"><a href=\"/opinion/798172/united-states-v-donovan-new/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 376-77 (8th\nCir. 2007) (“the purpose of the disclosure requirement is to assist the defense in cross-\nexamining the witness who made the statement, not with questioning some other\nwitness”).

Other Penalty Phase Issues\n\n       A. Non-Statutory Aggravating Factors. After listing the statutory aggravating\nfactors, the FDPA provides that the jury “may consider whether any other aggravating\nfactor for which notice has been given exists.” 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c). In this case, the\ngovernment gave notice, the district court submitted, and the jury found three non-\nstatutory aggravating factors: obstruction of justice, other criminal conduct, and victim\nimpact. Bolden appeals these findings on various grounds. We review the district\ncourt’s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion, Allen, 247 F.3d at 778, and\nBolden’s constitutional contentions de novo, Purkey, 428 F.3d at 761.10\n\n       (1) Obstruction of Justice. During the penalty phase, the government presented\nevidence that Bolden lied to police after being arrested, threatened Price and Edwards\nif they spoke about the crime, wiped prints off and hid the murder weapon, and told\nEdwards to change his appearance. The government argued that this aggravating\nfactor was established by evidence that Bolden killed Ley to prevent him from\nidentifying Bolden and then obstructed the investigation by lying to the police and\n\n\n      10\n        The contention that the government violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment\nrights by failing to charge non-statutory aggravating factors in the indictment is\nforeclosed by our decision in Purkey, 428 F.3d at 748-50.\n                                       -20-\n\fother post-offense conduct. The jury found as a non-statutory aggravating factor that\nBolden obstructed a criminal investigation and that this factor supported imposition\nof the death penalty.\n\n        Bolden argues his post-offense conduct lacked sufficient relevance to whether\nhe should be sentenced to death. We disagree. Other courts have approved use of an\nobstruction of justice non-statutory aggravating factor based upon post-offense\nconduct. See, e.g., United States v. Higgs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784555\"><a href=\"/opinion/784555/united-states-v-dustin-john-higgs/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322-23 (4th Cir. 2003)\n(disposing of murder weapon, destroying physical evidence, and directing witnesses\nto lie); United States v. Edelin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2444750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2444750/united-states-v-edelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 76-77 (D.D.C. 2001) (threatening\nwitnesses). This is consistent with the treatment of obstruction under the Sentencing\nGuidelines. U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. The district court did not err in submitting this non-\nstatutory factor based in part on Bolden’s post-offense conduct.\n\n       Bolden further argues that basing this factor on the killing of Ley renders it\nunconstitutionally vague because all murders eliminate a witness and therefore the\nfactor is only a rational aggravator if the witness is eliminated after the suspect’s\narrest. Again we disagree. The government presented evidence that, after\nimmobilizing Ley with the initial shot, Bolden paused a few seconds before firing the\nfatal shot into Ley’s head, evidence the murder was motivated in part to prevent Ley\nfrom identifying Bolden. Thus, the district court did not err in submitting this non-\nstatutory aggravating factor. Its relative weight was solely for the jury to decide.\n\n       (2) Other Criminal Conduct. At closing argument, the government argued that\nthe jury should find “other criminal activity” as a non-statutory aggravating factor\nbased on Bolden’s conviction of non-capital offenses during the guilt phase --\nconspiracy to commit bank robbery and being a felon-in-possession of a firearm -- and\non his 1993 Michigan conviction for resisting and obstructing a police officer. The\njury found this aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt and that it supported\nimposition of the death penalty. It is well-established that the government may offer\n\n                                        -21-\n\fevidence of “other criminal acts” as a non-statutory aggravating factor. See Allen,\n247 F.3d at 789 and cases cited.\n\n       Bolden argues that this non-statutory factor allowed the government to submit\nthe same evidence to support multiple aggravating factors, creating the risk that the\njury would give too much weight to the aggravating factors, thereby skewing its\nweighing of the aggravating and mitigating factors in deciding whether to impose the\ndeath penalty. Though the concern is legitimate, see Stringer v. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112705\"><a href=\"/opinion/112705/stringer-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n232-33 (1992), the Supreme Court has never held “that aggravating factors could be\nduplicative so as to render them constitutionally invalid.” Purkey, 428 F.3d at 762,\nquoting Jones v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118309\"><a href=\"/opinion/118309/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 398 (1999) (plurality opinion). The\ngovernment based the pecuniary gain statutory factor on Bolden’s desire to rob the\nbank. It based the obstruction of justice non-statutory factor on his motive to kill Ley\nto eliminate a witness. And it based the “other criminal activity” non-statutory factor\nin part on his possession of a firearm while conspiring to rob the bank. “[T]he same\nfacts can support different inferences that form different aggravators.” Purkey, 428\nF.3d at 762. The district court properly instructed the jurors that in weighing the\naggravating and mitigating factors, they were not simply to count each factor and\nreach a decision based on which number is greater; rather, they should individually\nconsider the weight and value of each factor before deciding whether a sentence of\ndeath is justified. There was no unconstitutional duplication.\n\n       Bolden further argues that, other than the conspiracy conviction, these crimes\nlacked sufficient relevance to the decision. He cites no authority supporting the\nassertion that the district court should have struck the other convictions on this\nground. The district court did not allow the government to introduce less relevant\naspects of Bolden’s criminal history, such as misrepresentations to his landlord and\nemployer, improperly received unemployment benefits, and multiple driving\nviolations. He argues that the Michigan convictions were too remote and allowed the\njury to consider unadjudicated drug trafficking. The record does not support this\nassertion. The court struck testimony regarding drug sales in 1994 that were well\n                                         -22-\n\fbefore Bolden’s 1995 Michigan conviction.11 The government did not argue that the\nMichigan drug offenses or their underlying conduct supported this non-statutory\nfactor, and the jury was instructed that these convictions could not constitute “other\ncrimes” for purposes of this factor. Moreover, in Lee, 274 F.3d at 494-95, we\naffirmed admitting evidence of various unadjudicated offenses.\n\n       (3) Victim Impact Evidence. “[T]he Eighth Amendment erects no per se bar”\nto the admission of victim impact evidence and to prosecutorial argument on that\nsubject. Payne v. Tennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 827 (1991). In the FDPA, Congress\nprovided that the government may introduce as a non-statutory aggravating factor\n“victim impact evidence” including “oral testimony, a victim impact statement that\nidentifies the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss\nsuffered by the victim and the victim’s family, and any other relevant information.”\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(a). Evidence “about the victim and about the impact of the murder\non the victim’s family is relevant to the jury’s decision as to whether or not the death\npenalty should be imposed [and t]here is no reason to treat such evidence differently\nthan other relevant evidence is treated.” Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. However, admission\nof evidence “so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair”\nviolates the Due Process Clause. Id. at 825.\n\n      Bolden contends that the district court erred by allowing sixteen victim impact\nwitnesses to testify during the penalty phase. He argues the testimony was\ncumulative, unfairly prejudicial, and “left the jury one small step removed from actual\nattendance at the victim’s memorial service.” He notes that sixteen witnesses far\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        His contention that the district court erred in denying a mistrial based on this\ntestimony is without merit. See Allen, 247 F.3d at 772 (standard of review). The jury\nis presumed to follow the district court’s prompt instruction to disregard the question\nand answer. Richardson v. Marsh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111865\"><a href=\"/opinion/111865/richardson-v-marsh/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206-07 (1987).\n                                          -23-\n\fexceeded the number this court has previously approved,12 and that their testimony\ntook up over 80% of the government’s penalty phase case-in-chief. Acknowledging\nthat no appellate court has vacated a federal death sentence on this ground, Bolden\nasserts that no appeal has presented “the voluminous amount and prejudicial quality”\nof impact evidence concerning a single victim.\n\n       Bolden cannot challenge the victim impact testimony by Ley’s parents and\nrelatives. See Payne, 501 U.S. at 827. He contends that allowing Ley’s friends,\ncoworkers, and pastor to testify about Ley’s relationship with his girlfriend, career\naspirations, and the affect of Ley’s death on his parents inflamed the jury, leaving it\nunable to fairly weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors. However, Ley’s\naspirations and relationships and the impact of his death on his family were highly\nrelevant to establishing this non-statutory factor. Though portions of this testimony\noverlapped, we agree with the district court it was not so cumulative as to confuse the\nissues or create unfair prejudice.13 Qualitatively, this evidence was similar to the\nvictim impact evidence we upheld in United States v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1395040\"><a href=\"/opinion/1395040/united-states-v-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">951</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 977 (8th\nCir. 2007); United States v.

Numerous witnesses read passages they wrote in a memorial journal. This was\nprobative of Ley’s character, not inflammatory, and substantially similar to evidence\ndeemed proper in other cases. See, e.g., Johnson, 495 F.3d at 976-77; Chanthadara,\n230 F.3d at 1274. The government played the tape of a 911 call from Ley’s girlfriend\n\n\n      12\n        In United States v. McVeigh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156859\"><a href=\"/opinion/156859/united-states-v-mcveigh/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1216 (10th Cir. 1998), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999), 38 victim impact witnesses testified about 168 victims\nof the Oklahoma City bombing.\n      13\n       The court observed near the end of the victim impact testimony that the\nwitnesses had been “restrained” and had done their best to control their emotions.\n                                      -24-\n\frequesting a police escort to the hospital on the afternoon he was killed. The\nprobative value of this evidence outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice because it best\ncaptured the emotional impact of Ley’s death on his loved ones. Admission of a\ncollection of photographs taken at a memorial service held by the bank where Ley\nworked, plus resolutions in Ley’s honor from the Missouri House of Representatives\nand the St. Louis Board of Alderman, were relevant to Ley’s “uniqueness” as a human\nbeing and the impact of his death, Payne, 501 U.S. at 823-27, and not so unduly\nprejudicial as to render the trial fundamentally unfair. Finally, a co-worker who ran\nto assist Ley when he was shot graphically described Ley’s condition and the impact\nthat experience had on the witness’s life. This was clearly admissible as the most\nprobative evidence of the effect of Bolden’s crime on his victim. It was undoubtedly\nprejudicial, but not unfairly so.\n\n        The district court placed few limits on Bolden’s mitigating evidence; he argued\nthirty-two mitigating factors to the jury. See Paul, 217 F.3d at 1002. The number of\nvictim impact witnesses alone does not establish unfair prejudice. After the sixteen\ntestified on Monday afternoon, Tuesday morning, and Wednesday morning, the jury\nheard closing arguments and instructions on Thursday. After the court’s cautionary\ninstructions regarding victim impact testimony and a recess on Friday, the jury began\ndeliberations the following Monday. It returned the verdict on Tuesday, finding all\nfive aggravating factors and many of the thirty-two mitigating factors. This timing\ndoes not suggest that the sentence was the product of passion rather than careful,\nreasoned judgment.\n\n       B. Mitigation Issues. The FDPA defines “mitigating factors” to include\n“factors in the defendant’s background, record, or character or any other circumstance\nof the offense that mitigate against imposition of the death sentence.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3592(a)(8). Here, the district court submitted thirty-two distinct mitigating factors,\ntwenty-one of which were found to exist by at least one juror. Bolden argues that the\ncourt erred by refusing to submit three additional factors: (a) “The execution of\nRobert Bolden may not necessarily alleviate the victim’s or victim’s family suffering.”\n                                          -25-\n\f(b) “Robert Bolden’s execution will cause his family great emotional pain and\ndistress.” (c) “The sentence of life in prison without the possibility of release is an\nadequate harsh alternative punishment that will protect society from further risk of\ncriminal conduct by Robert Bolden.” The court ruled that the record lacked evidence\nto support the submission of these three factors.\n\n       As to the first proposed factor, the government was precluded from eliciting\ntestimony concerning the Ley family’s desires for punishment. Parker v. Bowersox,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765807\"><a href=\"/opinion/765807/jahn-henri-parker-v-michael-bowersox/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 931 (8th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1038</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), and cases cited.\nThus, there was no evidence about the effect of Bolden’s execution on the Ley\nfamily’s suffering. As to the second, Bolden elicited substantial testimony from his\nchildren about his positive impact on their lives, and the district court submitted seven\nmitigating factors related to Bolden’s positive impact on his family and their love for\nhim. Any additional instruction would have been duplicative. As to the third, it was\nthe province of the jury to decide whether life in prison was “an adequate harsh\npunishment” for Bolden’s crimes. The government did not submit Bolden’s future\ndangerousness as a non-statutory aggravating factor, which obviated any need for a\nmitigating instruction whether life in prison would adequately protect society from the\nrisk of future criminal conduct.\n\n       “Special instructions are necessary when the jury could not otherwise give\nmeaningful effect to a defendant’s mitigating evidence.” Abdul-Kabir v. Quarterman,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145742\"><a href=\"/opinion/145742/abdul-kabir-v-quarterman/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1668 n.14 (2007) (emphasis in original). Here, in addition to\nsubmitting thirty-two factors, the district court instructed the jurors to consider any\n“mitigating factors whether or not specifically argued by defense counsel which are\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence.” There was no abuse of the court’s\nsubstantial discretion to fashion appropriate instructions.\n\n       Bolden further argues that the district court placed unconstitutional limits on his\nmitigation evidence. Prior to trial, the district court granted the government’s motion\nin limine to prevent Bolden from introducing unsworn allocution evidence during the\n                                           -26-\n\fpenalty phase without being subject to cross-examination. During the penalty phase,\nhe notified the government that mitigation witness John Wilson would testify that he\nhelped Bolden prepare a “statement of accountability” to explain his remorse to Ley’s\nfamily and friends. The government objected, and the district court ruled that Bolden\ncould not introduce the statement nor have Wilson testify about assisting Bolden in\npreparing it, as both constituted unsworn allocution. Bolden argues the court abused\nits discretion because this ruling contravened the Eighth Amendment by preventing\nhim from introducing relevant mitigation evidence.\n\n       The FDPA permits introduction of relevant mitigating evidence even if\ninadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, but “this does not mean that the\ndefense has carte blanche to introduce any and all evidence that it wishes.” Purkey,\n428 F.3d at 756. Among other limitations, the defendant “does not have a statutory\nright to make statements to a jury during the penalty phase of an FPDA trial without\nbeing subject to cross-examination.” Id. at 761. Here, the district court did not abuse\nits discretion in excluding an unsworn, unsigned, undated statement lacking any\nindicia of reliability unless the government could cross examine Bolden about its\ncreation. We also note that Bolden elicited testimony about his post-offense remorse\nfrom another mitigation witness.\n\n       C. Penalty Phase Evidentiary Issues. (1) Bolden argues that the district court\nabused its discretion by allowing the government to use a styrofoam head to illustrate\nthe trajectory of the bullets as they hit Ley during the testimony of a forensic\npathologist. Because the head was inflexible, he contends, it provided an arbitrary\nbasis for the jury to determine whether the shots were fired intentionally or\naccidentally. After obtaining assurances that the pathologist would limit her use of\nthe demonstrative exhibit, the court ruled that use of the skull would not be unfairly\nprejudicial and, alternatively, that any prejudice was outweighed by the probative\nvalue of this evidence. There was no abuse of the court’s substantial evidentiary\ndiscretion. United States v. Pirani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790098\"><a href=\"/opinion/790098/united-states-v-louis-f-pirani/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 555 (8th Cir.)

Cross exam of a penalty\nphase mitigation witness for bias is proper. Purkey, 428 F.3d at 760. Moreover, Rule\n611(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence expressly allows cross exam concerning\n“matters affecting the credibility of the witness.” We grant broad deference to the\ndistrict court’s determination of the appropriate scope of cross exam. United States\nv. Crenshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785270\"><a href=\"/opinion/785270/united-states-v-keith-bernard-crenshaw-united-states-of-america-v-kamil/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1002 (8th Cir. 2004). Here, the inquiry did not create a\nrisk of unfair prejudice, confuse the issues, or mislead the jury. See § 3593(c).\n\n       (3) During cross exam, the government asked Bolden’s aunt if she was aware\nBolden attempted to sell his daughters back to their mother for $5,000. Bolden\nobjected before the witness could answer. After a sidebar conference, the district\ncourt sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the question. On\nappeal, Bolden argues the question was improper. As the district court granted the\nrelief he requested, no issue was preserved for appellate review.\n\n       D. Penalty Phase Instruction Issue. Bolden first argues that the district\ncourt’s preliminary instruction at the start of the penalty phase concerning the possible\npenalties for his conviction on the felon-in-possession count misled the jury into\nbelieving he might not serve the rest of his life in prison if not sentenced to death.\nThis contention is frivolous. The court’s thorough final instructions at the conclusion\nof the penalty phase accurately stated the law and unambiguously instructed, with\nrespect to the bank robbery count: “if you determine that death is not justified . . . you\nmust record your determination that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment\nwithout possibility of release,” as 18 U.S.C. § 2113(e) mandates.\n\n       Bolden next argues that the district court erred in refusing to give a proffered\ninstruction reflecting his contention that, under § 3593(e), the jury is never required\nto impose a sentence of death, even if it has found that the aggravating circumstances\n                                          -28-\n\fsufficiently outweigh the mitigating circumstances to justify a death sentence. We\nhave rejected this contention in many cases. See, e.g., Allen, 247 F.3d at 779-82;\nPurkey, 428 F.3d at 762-63. The district court’s instructions were consistent with the\nFDPA as construed in these decisions. Moreover, the court’s instruction adequately\nincorporated Bolden’s contention that the jury was not required to impose a death\nsentence: “If you unanimously conclude that the aggravating factor or factors . . .\nsufficiently outweigh the mitigating factor or factors . . . and that therefore death is the\nappropriate sentence . . . you must record your determination that a sentence of death\nshall be imposed” (emphasis added).\n\n      E. The Mental State Gateway Issue. The FDPA provides that, for the\ndefendant to be eligible for a death sentence, the jury must find that he\n\n       (A) intentionally killed the victim; (B) intentionally inflicted serious\n       bodily injury that resulted in the death of the victim; (C) intentionally\n       participated in an act, contemplating that the life of a person would be\n       taken or intending that lethal force would be used . . . and the victim died\n       as a direct result of the act; or (D) intentionally . . . engaged in an act of\n       violence, knowing that the act created a grave risk of death . . . such that\n       participation . . . constituted a reckless disregard for human life and the\n       victim died as a direct result of the act.\n18 U.S.C. § 3591(a)(2). Over Bolden’s objection, the district court submitted and the\njury found that Bolden had acted with all four mental states in committing both capital\noffenses. Bolden argues that this enhanced the risk that jurors would inflate the\nweight of mental state evidence during the penalty phase. We disagree.\n\n       Numerous decisions have approved submission of multiple mental states in\nFDPA cases. See United States v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781737\"><a href=\"/opinion/781737/united-states-v-richard-allen-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 300-01 (4th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003); United States v.

Here, as in Webster, the court instructed the jury to weigh the\n\n                                           -29-\n\faggravating and mitigating factors with no mention of the “gateway” element of\nintent.14 Moreover, the verdict form segregated the mental state inquiry from the\naggravating and mitigating factors and “made clear the sequential nature of the\nprocess.” Webster, 162 F.3d at 324. Not every capital crime may support the\nsubmission of all four mental states, but the district court did not err in concluding that\nthe evidence warranted submitting all four in this case.\n\n       F. The Government’s Summation. Bolden argues that the government’s\n“incendiary” penalty phase closing argument denied him a fair trial. He objects to\nmany portions of the argument, but none of the arguments made on appeal were\npreserved with contemporaneous objections in the district court. Accordingly, our\nreview is for plain error. United States v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739332\"><a href=\"/opinion/739332/united-states-v-clarence-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1320</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326 (8th Cir.),\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). To obtain relief, Bolden must show that an error\noccurred, that it was plain, that it affected his substantial rights, and that it seriously\naffected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. To\nshow that an error affected his substantial rights, he must “demonstrate[] a reasonable\nprobability that he would have received a more favorable sentence with the . . . error\neliminated.” Pirani, 406 F.3d at 551.\n\n      Most of the arguments Bolden challenges were not improper. For example,\nBolden notes that the prosecutor repeatedly de-emphasized and belittled his proposed\nmitigating factors, but “as long as the jurors are not told to ignore or disregard\nmitigators, a prosecutor may argue, based on the circumstances of the case, that they\nare entitled to little or no weight.” Johnson, 495 F.3d at 978. The prosecutor did\n\n\n      14\n        Bolden relies on United States v. McCullah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712987\"><a href=\"/opinion/712987/united-states-v-john-javilo-mccullah/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1111-12 (10th Cir.\n1996), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997). McCullah is distinguishable because it\nturned on the submission of duplicative aggravating factors that included mental state\ncomponents under 21 U.S.C. § 848(n), a different federal death penalty statute. The\nTenth Circuit has more recently held that duplication “between the gateway [intent]\nfactors and aggravating factors does not undermine the constitutional validity” of a\ndeath sentence under the FDPA. Chanthadara, 230 F.3d at 1261.\n                                         -30-\n\fimproperly ask the jury to impose the death penalty on behalf of the Ley family, an\nargument for which there was no supporting evidence. Rather than object, Bolden\nlater requested an instruction that the jury not speculate about the family’s wishes.\nThe district court gave that instruction. After careful review of all the challenged\ncomments, we conclude they were isolated and insubstantial in context and far less\negregious than statements we have deemed harmless in other capital cases. See e.g.,\nJohnson, 495 F.3d at 979-80; Ortiz, 315 F.3d at 903. We conclude there was no plain\nerror and, alternatively, that Bolden has failed to establish plain error that substantially\naffected his rights.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\nEBEL, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I concur fully in the judgment and opinion of the court.\n\n       I write separately only to address in greater detail Defendant-Appellant\nBolden’s argument pertaining to the application of one of the statutory aggravating\nfactors that the jury found in this case. Bolden argues that the statutory aggravator\nthat applies when a defendant “has previously been convicted of 2 or more State or\nFederal offenses, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year,\ncommitted on different occasions, involving the distribution of a controlled\nsubstance,” 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(10), does not apply to him. Bolden concedes that he\nhas one such conviction for distributing cocaine. But Bolden argues that the second\nconviction on which the Government relied—a 1993 Michigan conviction for\nattempted possession of drugs with the intent to distribute—does not qualify.\n\n       Of course, possession of drugs with the intent to distribute is a crime “involving\nthe distribution of a controlled substance.” See United States v. Matra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502749\"><a href=\"/opinion/502749/united-states-v-wayne-a-matra-tn-warren-anthony-hutchinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n843 (8th Cir. 1988), abrogated on other grounds, United States v. McKinney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744230\"><a href=\"/opinion/744230/united-states-v-allen-h-mckinney/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133 (8th Cir. 1997). It is, however, a more difficult issue whether this statutory\n                                          -31-\n\faggravator includes a conviction for the attempt to possess drugs with the intent to\ndistribute.\n\n       There is, as far as I can tell, no published case law interpreting and applying this\nstatutory aggravating factor. The language of this aggravator is certainly broad\nenough to include attempts to commit the crime of distribution of a controlled\nsubstance because it contains the very inclusive word “involving”—“involving the\ndistribution of a controlled substance.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n       Further support for the inclusion of attempted possession with the intent to\ndistribute drugs in this aggravator may be found in the Supreme Court’s reasoning in\nJames v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145743\"><a href=\"/opinion/145743/james-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1586</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007). James applied, not the\nFederal Death Penalty Act (“FDPA”), but the Armed Career Criminal Act (“ACCA”),\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e). See 127 S. Ct. at 1590. Nevertheless, the ACCA provides a\nrelevant analogy to the case here because the ACCA similarly includes statutory\nprovisions that expressly include attempt offenses, and those that do not. In particular,\nthe ACCA defines a violent felony under that Act to include\n\n      any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\n      year . . . that—\n\n             (I) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened\n             use of physical force against the person of another; or\n\n             (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n             explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a\n             serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Like the FDPA’s statutory aggravators,\nthe ACCA thus expressly includes attempt offenses in one section, but does not\nmention them in the very next section of the statute. Nevertheless, the James Court\nrejected the argument that, because Congress expressly included attempts in one\n                                           -32-\n\fsection, attempt offenses could not be included in the next section. See James, 127\nS. Ct. at 1591-92. In its discussion of this issue, James concluded in dicta that the\nstatutory language addressing an offense that “involves use of explosives” is broad\nenough to include an attempt offense: “An unsuccessful attempt to blow up a\ngovernment building . . . would involve the use of explosives.”15 Id. at 1592\n(quotation, alterations omitted).\n\n       But when one considers the whole of the statutory aggravating factors set forth\nin the FDPA, an argument can be made that § 3592(c)(10) does not encompass a\nconviction for the attempt to possess drugs with the intent to distribute. Of the sixteen\nstatutory aggravating factors available under § 3592(c), four aggravators expressly\ninclude attempted offenses. See 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(1) (“The death, or injury\nresulting in death, occurred during the commission or attempted commission of, or\nduring the immediate flight from the commission of” one of twenty enumerated\nfederal felonies.) (emphasis added); id. § 3592(c)(2) (“[T]he defendant has previously\nbeen convicted of a Federal or State offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of\nmore than 1 year, involving the use or attempted or threatened use of a\nfirearm . . . against another person.”) (emphasis added); id. § 3592(c)(4) (“The\ndefendant has previously been convicted of 2 or more Federal or State offenses,\npunishable by a term of imprisonment of more than 1 year, committed on different\noccasions, involving the infliction of, or attempted infliction of, serious bodily injury\nor death upon another person.”) (emphasis added); id. § 3592(c)(16) (“The defendant\n\n\n      15\n        The specific issue James addressed was whether a prior conviction for\nattempted burglary was a violent felony under the ACCA. See 127 S. Ct. at 1590. In\nthat case, the parties agreed that attempted burglary did not fall within either\n§ 924(e)(2)(B)(i) or § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s enumerated offense of burglary. See James,\n127 S. Ct. at 1591. The James Court held that attempted burglary fell within\n§ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)’s residual language as an offense that “otherwise involves conduct\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.” See James, 127\nS. Ct. at 1593-98. In reaching this conclusion, James noted the breadth of the\nlanguage of that residual clause. See id. at 1597-98.\n                                          -33-\n\fintentionally killed or attempted to kill more than one person in a single criminal\nepisode.”) (emphasis added). The language specifically including attempts in these\nfour statutory aggravating factors and the conspicuous absence of attempt in the other\naggravators suggests that Congress knew how to include attempt offenses when it\nintended to do so.16\n\n       Moreover, two of these aggravators, 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(2) and (4),\nspecifically use both the terms “involving” and “attempt” together in the same\nprovision. This further suggests that Congress did not intend its use of the word\n“involving” automatically to include attempt offenses.\n\n       “The long established plain language rule of statutory construction requires\nexamining the text of the statute as a whole by considering its context, object, and\npolicy.” United States v.

See\n18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(3) (“The defendant has previously been convicted of another\nFederal or State offense resulting in the death of a person, for which a sentence of life\nimprisonment or a sentence of death was authorized by statute.”); id. § 3592(c)(12)\n(“The defendant had previously been convicted of violating title II or III of the\nComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 for which a sentence\nof 5 or more years may be imposed or had previously been convicted of engaging in\na continuing criminal enterprise.”).

And\nneither party points us to any legislative history that might better explain this seeming\ninconsistency. It may be that Congress intended to include attempts when the offenses\nat issue were particularly serious as, for example, offenses involving violence and\nweapons. But Congress has also often indicated that drug trafficking is serious\ncriminal conduct. On the other hand, the difference in terminology could be explained\nby the fact that the statutory aggravators in § 3592 were often lifted from other\npre-existing statutes, and additional aggravators were added to this section over the\nyears. Thus, the various aggravators often come from different sources and their\ndifferent language may simply be a consequence of this mixed pedigree with no actual\nsignificance intended by Congress between various phraseologies used.\n\n        Where a criminal statute is ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires us to give the\ndefendant the benefit of the doubt. See United States v. Santos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145804\"><a href=\"/opinion/145804/united-states-v-santos/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted\nin favor of the defendants subjected to them”). And the rule of lenity “applies to\nsentencing as well as substantive [criminal statutory] provisions.” Rowe v. Lockhart,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"437173\"><a href=\"/opinion/437173/rodney-lee-rowe-v-al-lockhart-director-arkansas-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">736</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 461 (8th Cir. 1984); see United States v.

Rowe, 736 F.2d at 460-62 (discussing rule\nof lenity, but not applying it in that case to overturn thirty-year sentence for attempted\ncapital murder).\n                                             -35-\n\f       Nevertheless, I am ultimately persuaded that § 3592(c)(10) is not ambiguous,\nand that that aggravating factor does encompass Bolden’s prior conviction for the\nattempted possession of drugs with the intent to distribute, for several reasons. First,\nno persuasive reason is apparent to me why Congress would have intentionally desired\nto exclude attempts under § 3592(c)(10) but to include attempts under many of the\nother aggravators. Thus, to give meaning to the differences in language between the\nvarious aggravators in § 3592(c) would be rank speculation. I do not believe rank\nspeculation should trump the language of § 3592(c) standing alone. Second, James,\nin a different context, indicated that the fact that Congress expressly included\nattempted offenses in one subsection of a statute but not in another subsection did not\nmean that attempted convictions could not be included in a subsection lacking an\nexpress reference to attempt. See 127 S. Ct. at 1591-92. Third, the language\nCongress used in § 3592(c)(10)—prior convictions “involving the distribution of a\ncontrolled substance” (emphasis added)—is very broad language that would naturally\nencompass attempts to possess a controlled substance with the intent to distribute.\nIndeed, as James made clear, the word “involving” has explicitly been applied to\ninclude attempts. In James, the Court in dicta said that an unsuccessful attempt to\nblow up a government building would constitute a violent felony under the clause in\n18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) that reads, “involves the use of explosives.”\n\n      For these reasons, I agree that § 3592(c)(10) encompassed Bolden’s prior\nconviction for the attempted possession of drugs with the intent to distribute.\n                       ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\f</pre>",
