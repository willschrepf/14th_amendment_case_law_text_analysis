Affirmed in part, reversed in part, remanded with directions.\n\n         Fasel & Fasel, Frank R. Fasel; Law Offices of Yasmine Djawadian and Yasmine\n\nDjawadian for Defendants and Appellants.\n\n         No appearance for Plaintiff and Respondent.\n\f       AMS Stones Warehouse, Inc. (AMS) and Carla McEwen (McEwen) appeal from a\n\njudgment following a bench trial wherein the trial court found in favor of Premium\n\nStones Trading Corporation (Premium Stones), awarding Premium Stones $119,191.62\n\nplus $44,970.38 in interest for a breach of oral contract, among other claims, as well as\n\n$7,500 for passing dishonored checks. The judgment also included the trial court's\n\nfinding that McEwen was the alter ego of AMS.\n\n       AMS and McEwen contend that substantial evidence does not support the court's\n\njudgment. We agree that substantial evidence does not support the court's finding in\n\nfavor of Premium Stones on the claim for account stated or the award of treble damages\n\nfor the dishonored checks, and we reverse the judgment as to these two claims. In all\n\nother respects, we affirm the judgment.\n\n                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       AMS and McEwen's primary contention on appeal is that substantial evidence\n\ndoes not support the judgment following a bench trial. However, they fail to provide us\n\nwith any semblance of the evidence admitted at trial to support the trial court's judgment,\n\nwhich is essential for a substantial evidence review. (See Ortega v. Pajaro Valley\n\nUnified School Dist. (1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 1023, 1043 (Ortega).) The \"Statement of\n\nFacts\" section of the opening brief merely presents on overview of the procedural history\n\nof the dispute as well as a cursory explanation of the witnesses at trial. AMS and\n\nMcEwen do not supply us with the relevant facts based on the evidence admitted at trial.\n\nInstead, they merely present us with \"evidence\" and argument that support only their\n\nposition. This is improper and inappropriate, especially when AMS and McEwen have\n\n                                             2\n\fsubmitted the only brief in this matter. We therefore have provided a factual and\n\nprocedural history of this matter based on the record with minimal guidance from the\n\nopening brief.\n\n                                 The Operative Pleadings\n\n       Premium Stones brought suit against AMS, McEwen, Faber Stone, LLC (Faber),\n\nFBR Marble, Inc. (FBR), and Hikmet Aksel (Aksel) (AMS, McEwen, Faber, FBR, and\n\nAksel collectively referred to as Defendants) for breach of oral contract, goods sold and\n\ndelivered, open book account, account stated, and claim on dishonored checks. The\n\ngravamen of the complaint involved Premium Stones's contention that AMS failed to pay\n\nit pursuant to an oral consignment agreement. Premium Stones also alleged McEwen,\n\nFaber, FBR, and Aksel were all alter egos of AMS.\n\n       AMS brought a cross-complaint against Premium Stones, Mauro Pitanga (Mauro),\n\nand Claudia Pitanga (Claudia) for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation,\n\nintentional misrepresentation, accounting of joint venture, quantum meruit, and\n\npromissory estoppel. AMS's primary contention was that it entered into a joint venture\n\nwith Premium Stones and Premium Stones breached that agreement by failing to infuse\n\ncash into the joint venture and taking more than one-third of the profits of the joint\n\nventure. AMS also claimed Mauro and Claudia were employees of Premium Stones,\n\nwho acted on the company's behalf.\n\n       The claims in both the operative complaint and the cross-complaint were tried in a\n\nbench trial.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                    Premium Stones's Case\n\n          Mauro is president of Premium Stones. Premium Stones's business consists of\n\nexporting granite from Brazil and selling it on consignment. Premium Stones's typical\n\nconsignment agreement involves providing a retailer with granite, and the retailer selling\n\nthe granite to the consumer and paying Premium Stones its costs plus 50 percent of the\n\nprofit.\n\n          Premium Stones started operating in 2007. At that time, it was incorporated in\n\nFlorida under the name Premium Stones Corporation. However, Premium Stones\n\nCorporation's accountant, Derek Nakagawa (Nakagawa), advised Mauro to move the\n\ncompany to California because all of the company's business was there. Premium Stones\n\nmoved to California and was incorporated under the name \"Premium Stones Trading\n\nCorporation\" in 2008. Mauro added \"Trading\" to the company's name to make it \"a little\n\nbit different\" and to better represent its style of business. When Premium Stones moved\n\nto California, Nakagawa transferred all of Premium Stones Corporation's assets, debts,\n\nand liabilities to Premium Stones. Premium Stones continued to serve the same clients as\n\nPremium Stones Corporation and operated under previously existing consignment\n\nagreements entered into by Premium Stones Corporation.\n\n          In early 2007, Mauro's friend introduced him to McEwen. McEwen was the\n\nowner of Brazil Stones located at 7988 Miramar Road in San Diego. The physical\n\nlocation of Brazil Stones consisted of a spacious yard with \"slabs\" of material like granite\n\nas well as a large doublewide trailer containing an office, kitchen, and bathroom.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f         Premium Stones and Brazil Stones entered into a written consignment agreement\n\n(the Written Agreement).1 Under the Written Agreement, McEwen selected the granite\n\nshe wanted from Premium Stones based on the granite Premium Stones had available at\n\nthat time. Premium Stones then delivered the selected granite to Brazil Stones. Upon\n\ndelivery, McEwen inspected the granite to ensure that she received what she ordered and\n\nprovided Premium Stones with confirmation that she had received the material ordered.\n\nMauro informed McEwen of the cost of the granite. Brazil Stones then sold the granite\n\nand paid Premium Stones the cost plus 50 percent of the profit after the sale. Mauro\n\nreturned to Brazil Stones's warehouse every 15 days or so to check on the amount of\n\ngranite sold. McEwen sometimes provided Mauro with written confirmation of what was\n\nsold and for what price, and at other times, McEwen informed Mauro verbally of the\n\nsales.\n\n         Shortly after Premium Stones and Brazil Stones began doing business, Brazil\n\nStones changed its name to AMS. Mauro visited Brazil Stones's yard at 7988 Miramar\n\nRoad and saw that the yard contained a sign indicating that the company was now called\n\nAMS. Brazil Stones did not provide any written notice to Premium Stones that it was\n\nchanging its name nor did it ask Premium Stones to remove any of its unsold granite.\n\nMauro noticed that the employees were the same at AMS as they were at Brazil Stones.\n\nMcEwen told Mauro that she changed Brazil Stones's name to AMS because Brazil\n\nStones had owed \"a bunch of people\" money. However, she explained to Mauro that\n\n\n1     Although the Written Agreement was a trial exhibit that was admitted into\nevidence, AMS and McEwen did not include it in their appellant's appendix.\n                                             5\n\fAMS and Brazil Stones were the same company and AMS would continue to sell\n\nPremium Stones's granite. McEwen also informed Mauro that AMS was her company\n\nand she would continue to operate like nothing had changed.\n\n       When Brazil Stones changed its name to AMS, McEwen began working with\n\nAksel. Aksel was McEwen's partner and had an ownership interest in AMS. He also had\n\nan ownership interest in Faber and FBR, both of which operated similar businesses to\n\nAMS.2 Mauro met Aksel when he learned that Brazil Stones had changed its name to\n\nAMS.\n\n       At some point, AMS experienced financial difficulties and fell behind on its\n\npayments to Premium Stones. Premium Stones maintained an account statement that\n\nshowed invoices, relating to granite provided to AMS, which had been paid or partially\n\npaid. The account statement illustrated that Premium Stones had billed AMS a total of\n\n$230,237.22 and had an open balance of $119,191.62. The account statement was\n\ncreated by Nakagawa using a computer accounting system called QuickBooks.\n\nNakagawa created the account statement for AMS in his usual course of business by\n\ninputting information regarding the purchases of inventory, customer sales, deposits to\n\nthe bank, and payment of bills based on information provided to him, such as bills of\n\nlading, invoices, and purchase orders.\n\n       During the course of their business relationship, AMS provided Premium Stones\n\nwith four checks that were returned for insufficient funds. The first check, numbered\n\n\n2     Premium Stones unsuccessfully sued Faber and FBR as alter egos of AMS; thus,\nwe do not include any substantive discussion of Faber or FBR.\n                                            6\n\f1230, was made payable to Premium Stones in the amount of $6,500 and was dated\n\nFebruary 25, 2008. On the face of that check was a stamp stating: \"Return Reason - A\n\nNot Sufficient Funds.\" The second check, numbered 2077, was made payable to\n\nPremium Stones in the amount of $3,000 and was dated June 20, 2008. On the face of\n\nthat check was a stamp providing: \"Return Reason - S Refer to Maker.\" The third check,\n\nnumbered 2085, was made payable to Premium Stones in the amount of $6,112.71 and\n\nwas dated June 27, 2008. On the face of that check was a stamp avowing: \"Return\n\nReason - A Not Sufficient Funds.\" The fourth check, numbered 1038, was made payable\n\nto AMS in the amount of $800 and dated September 2008 (the day was illegible). On the\n\nface of that check was a stamp affirming: \"Return Reason - C Stop Payment.\" Premium\n\nStones provided additional evidence that it did not receive funds to cover any of the\n\nreturned checks.\n\n       McEwen also wrote a check, numbered 1045, on her personal account made\n\npayable to Premium Stones in the amount of $4,000 and was dated July 8, 2008. The\n\ncheck was returned for insufficient funds and bore the stamp on the face of the check\n\nstating: \"Return Reason – A Not Sufficient Funds.\" Premium Stones provided additional\n\nevidence that it did not receive funds to cover McEwen's returned check.\n\n       McEwen drove one of AMS's company cars, a BMW. She would use an AMS\n\ncredit card to buy gas. McEwen also used the AMS credit card to purchase: meals at\n\nrestaurants like Outback Steakhouse, McDonald's, and In-N-Out; supplies and materials\n\nfrom Home Depot; groceries, children's toys, clothing, and veterinary services for\n\nMcEwen's dog. AMS's bank records also indicated that mortgage payments were made\n\n                                             7\n\ffrom the account, but AMS did not have a mortgage. McEwen also caused AMS to make\n\na $2,000 payment to the Kabbalah Centre. In addition, AMS's bank records showed that\n\nchecks were written to McEwen and on McEwen's behalf in relation to real estate\n\ntransactions that did not involve AMS. Also, McEwen wrote a $5,000 check on behalf of\n\nAMS for rent.\n\n                                     Defendants' Case\n\n       Defendants challenged Premium Stones's case with four primary theories. First,\n\nthey argued they never did business with Premium Stones because Premium Stones was\n\nincorporated in 2008 after the dispute arose. Instead, Defendants contend they only did\n\nbusiness with Premium Stones Corporation, a Florida corporation that no longer existed\n\nat the time of the trial. Second, Defendants argued that all of Premium Stones's activities\n\nwere intended to fraudulently obtain work visas for Mauro and Claudia. The trial court\n\ndid not allow any evidence on this matter although Defendants tried numerous times to\n\noffer such evidence. Therefore, we omit any discussion of this theory. Third, Defendants\n\nclaimed Premium Stones's employees created purchase orders on AMS's computers; thus,\n\nthe purchase orders produced at trial were shams and did not originate from AMS.\n\nFinally, Defendants claimed that they paid Premium Stones far more money than\n\nPremium Stones was seeking in the suit. In other words, there was no open balance.\n\n       Aksel handled the \"financials\" for AMS. Aksel admitted that Premium Stones\n\nCorporation and AMS entered into an oral agreement, but characterized the agreement as\n\na joint venture. Aksel described the agreement as requiring Premium Stones Corporation\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fto provide granite to AMS, which AMS would sell and pay Premium Stones Corporation\n\nits costs plus one-third of any profits.\n\n          Aksel, however, testified that the joint venture agreement never was reduced to\n\nwriting despite the parties' attempts to do so. In one of the draft agreements that Aksel\n\nbelieved McEwen drafted, the draft agreement made clear that liabilities AMS owed to\n\nPremium Stones in the amount of $119,998 would not be paid if the parties agreed to the\n\njoint venture. Although Aksel admitted the $119,998 amount came from AMS's\n\nQuickBooks system, he testified that its profit and loss statements were unreliable as\n\nwere some of AMS's inventory and sales reports. In other words, Aksel claimed the\n\n$119,998 listed as a liability AMS owed Premium Stones was not accurate.\n\n          Aksel testified that when he made payments to Premium Stones, they were not\n\nrelated to any invoice. He simply made payments to Premium Stones by check when\n\nPremium Stones requested a check, but the understanding was that Premium Stones\n\nwould not deposit the check until AMS collected the funds from AMS's customers.\n\nAksel testified that AMS had a record of the total amount of payments made to Premium\n\nStones, but AMS did not produce any such record. Aksel agreed this was true despite the\n\nfact that AMS's accounting software (QuickBooks) had the ability to produce such a\n\nreport.\n\n          McEwen testified that she sometimes told people she was an owner of AMS\n\nbecause it was easier to explain than her claim that her mother was an owner and\n\nMcEwen had power of attorney over her mother's assets. McEwen took the position that\n\nshe was only AMS's employee. She also testified that all her credit card charges with\n\n                                               9\n\fAMS's credit card were for business purposes. However, McEwen admitted that she used\n\nAMS's bank accounts for personal expenses, but she reimbursed those accounts. She\n\nprovided no documents to support this testimony.\n\n        In addition, McEwen explained that the $72,787 of cash withdrawals from AMS's\n\nbank account was used to pay employees and vendors. McEwen also claimed she made\n\nseveral payments in cash to Premium Stones, but did not have any documents proving\n\nsuch.\n\n                                 The Trial Court's Findings\n\n        After hearing closing arguments, the trial court granted Premium Stones's motion\n\nfor a nonsuit on the cross-complaint. In granting the motion, the court noted that the \"the\n\ncross-complainants, in trying to establish the elements of their causes of action lack total\n\ncredibility that there was any agreement whatsoever.\"\n\n        The trial court asked Premium Stones's counsel to draft a statement of decision\n\nand provided the following guidance:\n\n           \"My ruling in this case is and will turn on the credibility of the\n           witnesses. [¶] I have listened to the testimony of the Defendants in\n           this case, and I find each of the individuals to be incredible. I have\n           never – well, that's not true, I can't say 'never,' but the testimony of\n           Ms. McEwen is incredible, her conduct inappropriate, he-she. Well,\n           anyway, I have listened to the explanation of the documents which\n           she purported to deny. [¶] The Defendants did not produce any\n           documents other than attack the Plaintiff's documents and say that\n           they were unreal and unreliable. There were no corporate\n           documents expressed. So, in terms of credibility, I have a list that I\n           will be utilizing when we go review the statement of decisions that\n           are proposed. [¶] As to the alter ego allegations. My tentative is\n           this that judgment clearly is against AMS Stones Warehouse, Inc., a\n           California corporation. It is [clear] to me that Carla McEwen is, in\n           fact, and has, in fact used AMS Stones Warehouse Inc. as an alter\n\n                                              10\n\f             ego. She's used the corporation as her personal piggy bank. The\n             cash deposits, the cash that's been withdrawn from ATM, the\n             purchases for clothes, food, all were for personal purposes, all by\n             someone who had the unfettered access to the accounts and she used\n             those freely. And I've gone through the analysis and the criteria and\n             I think that if there was any case that has met the alter ego criteria,\n             Ms. McEwen meets that criteria with AMS Stones.\"\n\n       Premium Stones submitted a proposed statement of decision. The trial court\n\nsigned the proposed statement of decision with minor changes not relevant to any of the\n\nissues raised here. Defendants filed an objection to the court's statement of decision\n\narguing that Defendants were denied an opportunity to propose a statement of decision or\n\ncomment on Premium Stones's proposed statement of decision. The court subsequently\n\nentered judgment. AMS and McEwen appealed.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n                                                I\n\n                           AMS AND MCEWEN'S CONTENTIONS\n\n       AMS and McEwen contend that substantial evidence does not support the\n\njudgment. Specifically, they maintain: (1) the evidence showed Premium Stones lacked\n\nstanding to sue and (2) the evidence was insufficient to show a breach of oral agreement,\n\na cause of action for goods sold and delivered, a claim for open book account, a cause of\n\naction for account stated, a claim on dishonored checks, and that McEwen was AMS's\n\nalter ego.\n\n                                    A. Standard of Review\n\n       \"In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, we resolve all conflicts in\n\nfavor of the prevailing party and we indulge all legitimate and reasonable inferences to\n\n                                               11\n\fuphold the verdict if possible. 'It is an elementary, but often overlooked principle of law,\n\nthat when a verdict is attacked as being unsupported, the power of the appellate court\n\nbegins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,\n\ncontradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the conclusion reached by the\n\njury. . . .' [Citation.]\" (Ortega, supra, 64 Cal.App.4th at p. 1043.) Our review is not\n\nlimited to appraising \" 'isolated bits of evidence selected by the [appellant].' \" (Bowers v.\n\nBernards (1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 870, 873.) We are required to accept all evidence\n\nwhich supports the successful party, disregard the contrary evidence, and draw all\n\nreasonable inferences to uphold the verdict. (Minelian v. Manzella (1989) 215\n\nCal.App.3d 457, 463.) Thus, it is not our role to reweigh the evidence, redetermine the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses, or resolve conflicts in the testimony, and we will not disturb\n\nthe judgment if there is evidence to support it. (Reichardt v. Hoffman (1997) 52\n\nCal.App.4th 754, 766; see Leff v. Gunter (1983) 33 Cal.3d 508, 518 (Leff).) Credibility is\n\nan issue of fact for the finder of fact to resolve (Johnson v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc.\n\n(1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 613, 622), and the testimony of a single witness, even that of a\n\nparty, is sufficient to provide substantial evidence to support a finding of fact (In re\n\nMarriage of Mix (1975) 14 Cal.3d 604, 614). \"The ultimate test is whether it is\n\nreasonable for a trier of fact to make the ruling in question in light of the whole record.\"\n\n(Roddenberry v. Roddenberry (1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 634, 652.) Because Premium\n\nStones was the prevailing party at trial, we review the evidence in a light most favorable\n\nto it. (Cassim v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 787.)\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f      Although AMS and McEwen raise a substantial evidence challenge, they fail to\n\ncite appropriately to the record to mount such a challenge. They do not provide us with\n\nthe evidence that ostensibly supports the judgment and explain how this evidence\n\nultimately falls short in supporting the judgment. Instead, AMS and McEwen focus on\n\nevidence they provided during trial. However, the trial court determined that their\n\nevidence, especially Aksel's and McEwen's testimony, was unbelievable. We cannot\n\nreweigh the evidence as AMS and McEwen impliedly urge us to do. (See Scott v. Pacific\n\nGas & Electric Co. (1995) 11 Cal.4th 454, 465.)\n\n                             B. Premium Stones's Standing\n\n      AMS and McEwen contend that Premium Stones lacks standing to sue. They\n\nargue that any business AMS conducted was with Premium Stones Corporation, a Florida\n\ncorporation, that was \"dissolved at all times during said litigation.\" As such, AMS and\n\nMcEwen contend that Premium Stones Corporation was the real party in interest, and\n\nPremium Stones, a California corporation, was not the proper plaintiff. We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n      Mauro testified that, on Nakagawa's suggestion, he moved Premium Stones\n\nCorporation from Florida to California. All of Premium Stones Corporation's business\n\nwas in California. He renamed the entity Premium Stones Trading Corporation. When\n\nPremium Stones Corporation moved to California, Mauro, through Nakagawa,\n\ntransferred all its assets, debts, and liabilities to Premium Stones. The new Premium\n\nStones continued to serve the same clients as the former Premium Stones Corporation\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fand operated under previously existing consignment agreements entered into by Premium\n\nStones Corporation.\n\n       Further, it was apparent that Aksel and McEwen were aware that Premium Stones\n\nCorporation was operating as Premium Stones. They tried to negotiate a joint venture\n\nagreement between Premium Stones and AMS. Indeed, AMS cross-complained against\n\nPremium Stones for breach of an alleged joint venture agreement.\n\n       In short, substantial evidence shows that Premium Stones Corporation moved to\n\nCalifornia, changed its name and continued to do business with the same customers as\n\nbefore. And Aksel and McEwen drew no distinction between Premium Stones\n\nCorporation and Premium Stones in their business dealings, except that they attempted to\n\nnegotiate a joint venture with Premium Stones only.\n\n       AMS and McEwen contend, even if we determine Premium Stones assumed all\n\nthe liabilities and assets of Premium Stones Corporation, Premium Stones still lacked\n\nstanding to sue on behalf of Premium Stones Corporation. (See J.C. Peacock, Inc. v.\n\nHasko (1960) 184 Cal.App.2d 142, 150-152 (J.C. Peacock).) AMS and McEwen's\n\nreliance on J.C. Peacock is misplaced.\n\n       In J.C. Peacock, supra, 184 Cal.App.2d 142, the Court of Appeal determined that\n\nthe plaintiff, the surviving postmerger corporation, could not initiate a lawsuit in the\n\nname of the merged out corporation. Having done so in the name of a corporation that no\n\nlonger existed, the plaintiff \"was not entitled to the extraordinary and summary\n\nproceeding of attachment.\" (Id. at p. 152.) Here, Premium Stones did not bring suit in\n\nthe name of a nonexistent corporation. In contrast, Premium Stones was abundantly clear\n\n                                             14\n\fduring its case-in-chief, consistent with its complaint, that it was pursuing damages based\n\non its business relationship with AMS, not Premium Stones Corporation's relationship\n\nwith AMS. Unlike the plaintiff in J.C. Peacock, Premium Stones did not file numerous\n\ncomplaints in the name of a merged out corporation while consistently representing to the\n\ncourt that the merged out company still legally existed. Premium Stones proceeded with\n\nthe instant action at all times as Premium Stones. It never represented to the court that\n\nPremium Stones Corporation was the proper plaintiff. In addition, Premium Stones was\n\nan incorporated California corporation prior to filing suit. J.C. Peacock therefore is not\n\ninstructive here. Premium Stones had standing.\n\n                    C. Breach of Oral Contract and Common Counts\n\n       AMS and McEwen next contend that substantial evidence does not support the\n\ntrial court's finding in favor of Premium Stones on its causes of action for breach of oral\n\ncontract, goods sold and delivered, and open book account. We disagree.\n\n       To state a cause of action for breach of contract, a party must plead the existence\n\nof a contract, his or her performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, the\n\ndefendant's breach, and resulting damage. (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) 74\n\nCal.App.4th 299, 307.) Here, Premium Stones offered sufficient evidence to establish\n\neach of these elements.\n\n       Premium Stones Corporation and Brazil Stones entered into a written consignment\n\ncontract whereby Premium Stones Corporation would provide Brazil Stones with slabs of\n\ngranite, and after Brazil Stones sold the slabs, it would pay Premium Stones Corporation\n\nits costs plus half the profits. When Brazil Stones changed its name to AMS, McEwen,\n\n                                             15\n\fon behalf of AMS, confirmed that AMS would continue to do business with Premium\n\nStones Corporation under the terms of the written agreement. Premiums Stones\n\nCorporation subsequently changed its name to Premium Stones Trading Corporation and\n\ncontinued to do business with AMS.\n\n       AMS and McEwen argue there was no contract because Premium Stones did not\n\nprove a \"meeting of the minds\": there was a disagreement between the parties regarding\n\nthe amount AMS would pay Premiums Stones. \"Evidence\" of this disagreement is found\n\nin the testimony of Aksel and McEwen. The court, however, determined their respective\n\ntestimony was unreliable. The court believed Mauro's testimony that McEwen agreed to\n\nan oral contract according to the terms testified to by Mauro. One witness's testimony\n\ncan establish substantial evidence. (See In re Marriage of Mix, supra, 14 Cal.3d at\n\np. 614.) Despite the urging of AMS and McEwen, we cannot reevaluate witness\n\ncredibility or reweigh evidence on appeal. (Leff, supra, 33 Cal.3d at p. 518.)\n\n       We also are satisfied that substantial evidence shows Premium Stones proved its\n\nperformance under the oral contract. It offered Mauro's testimony regarding the delivery\n\nof slabs of granite to AMS as well as purchase orders from AMS confirming the granite\n\nreceived, Premium Stones's invoices, and other documentary evidence showing that\n\nPremium Stones delivered granite slabs to AMS. McEwen's and AMS's challenge goes\n\nto the weight of the evidence considered by the trial court. They argue that AMS did not\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fcreate the purchase orders, some of the documents were illegible,3 and other documents\n\nwere unreliable. It bears repeating that we do not reweigh the evidence on appeal. (Leff,\n\nsupra, 33 Cal.3d at p. 518.)\n\n       In addition, there was substantial evidence that AMS breached the oral contract\n\nand Premium Stones was damaged. Premium Stones offered an account statement\n\nshowing an unpaid balance of $119,191.62. This amount was close to the amount of\n\nliability AMS owed Premium Stones as set forth in a document created by McEwen\n\nbased on AMS's records. Further, Premium Stones provided evidence through\n\nNakawaga's testimony regarding the creation of the account statement and how the\n\noutstanding balance was calculated.\n\n       AMS and McEwen challenge the account statement, arguing that it contained the\n\ndate \"August 1, 2011\" and time \"6:11 p.m.\" on the top left corner indicating it was made\n\n\"nearly eleven months after the lawsuit was filed.\" However, this is an argument that\n\nneeded to be made to the trial court. AMS and McEwen had the opportunity to probe this\n\nissue during the cross-examination of Mauro and Nakagawa. They did not sufficiently do\n\nso, and there is nothing in the record supporting their argument now. Perhaps, the date\n\nand time stamp on the document indicate when that spreadsheet was printed. Maybe the\n\ndate and time stamp are incorrect. On this record, we do not know. As such, we accept\n\n\n\n\n3     There only appears to have been one document admitted into evidence where\nDefendants objected that it was illegible, but the court admitted only the first page of the\ndocument, which was legible.\n                                             17\n\fthe trial court's reliance on the account statement and consider it substantial evidence of\n\nthe amount AMS owed Premium Stones.\n\n       Like Premium Stones's claim for breach of oral contract, we are satisfied that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the trial court's finding in favor of Premium Stones on its\n\ncauses of action for goods sold and delivered and open book. These claims are common\n\ncounts. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Pleading, § 553, p. 680.) \"The only\n\nessential [elements] of a common count are '(1) the statement of indebtedness in a certain\n\nsum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment.'\n\n[Citation.]\" (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 445, 460.) Here, the\n\nsame evidence that supports Premium Stones's claim for breach of oral contract supports\n\nthese common counts.\n\n       In summary, substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings in favor of\n\nPremium Stones that it proved its claims for breach of oral contract, goods sold and\n\ndelivered, and open book.\n\n                                    D. Account Stated\n\n       \"The essential elements of an account stated are: (1) previous transactions\n\nbetween the parties establishing a relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement\n\nbetween the parties, express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the\n\ncreditor; (3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.\" (Zinn\n\nv. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) 271 Cal.App.2d 597, 600.) AMS and McEwen assert that\n\nthe evidence does support the second element of this cause of action. We agree.\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       There is nothing in the record indicating an agreement between the parties that\n\nAMS would pay Premium Stones a set amount. Although Premium Stones's spreadsheet\n\nand AMS's own documents indicate amounts owed that are close to the same number,\n\nthey do not match. No other evidence offered at trial shows that the parties agreed on the\n\nexact amount AMS owed Premium Stones. Thus, substantial evidence does not support\n\nthe trial court's finding that Premium Stones proved its cause of action for account stated.\n\n                                E. The Dishonored Checks\n\n       Premium Stones brought claims based on five dishonored checks. Although we\n\nare satisfied that Premium Stones proved that each check was returned for insufficient\n\nfunds, we agree with AMS and McEwen that Premium Stones was not entitled to treble\n\ndamages under Civil Code section 1719, subdivision (a)(2). That subdivision allows the\n\npayee to recover treble damages capped at $1,500 if the payee sends written demand by\n\ncertified mail to the person who passed the check advising him or her that if he or she\n\ndoes not pay the amount of the check within 30 days from the date of the written demand,\n\nhe or she could be liable for treble damages. (Civ. Code, § 1719, subd. (a)(2).)\n\n       There is nothing in the record indicating that Premium Stones proved that they\n\nmade the required mailings. We note that copies of what purports to be the required\n\nmailings are attached to Premium Stones's complaint, but neither letter was admitted at\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\ftrial. Without proof of the mailings, Premium Stones was not entitled to treble damages\n\nand the judgment as to the award of treble damages must be reversed.4\n\n                                       F. Alter Ego\n\n       The trial court found that McEwen was the alter ego of AMS. McEwen\n\nchallenges this finding, arguing it is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically,\n\nMcEwen argues that there was no evidence that she was anything more than an employee\n\nof AMS. She also contends that, even if she was an owner of AMS, there was no\n\nevidence supporting any of the factors warranting an alter ego finding. We disagree.\n\n       A corporation is ordinarily regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct from its\n\nshareholders, officers, and directors. (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court ( 2000)\n\n83 Cal.App.4th 523, 538 (Sonora).) Nonetheless, a corporate identity may be\n\ndisregarded \"where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies holding the equitable\n\nownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the corporation.\" (Ibid.) Alter ego\n\nliability affords relief when \"some conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable\n\nfor the corporate owner to hide behind the corporate form.\" (Id. at p. 539.)\n\n\n\n\n4      AMS and McEwen insist that Premium Stones was awarded damages equaling the\nentire open balance, which included the amount of the returned checks. AMS and\nMcEwen therefore argue that any damages awarded for the dishonored checks are\nimproper \"double\" damages. We disagree. The judgment does not award Premium\nStones both the amount of the open book in addition to the amount of the checks.\nInstead, in regard to the dishonored checks, the court awarded Premium Stones treble\ndamages under Civil Code section 1719, subdivision (a)(2) only. These damages are in\naddition to the amount of the checks, which the court did not award Premium Stones in\naddition to the damages for the open book. The treble damages would have been proper\nif Premium Stones had proven the required mailing occurred.\n                                             20\n\f       Two conditions must be met to find alter ego liability: (1) \"[T]here must be such a\n\nunity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the\n\nseparate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist\"; and\n\n(2) if the acts in question are treated as those of only the corporation, the result will be\n\ninequitable. (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 538.)\n\n       Among the factors to be considered in applying the alter ego doctrine are\n\n(1) commingling of funds and other assets, (2) the holding out by one entity that it is\n\nliable for the debts of the other, (3) identical equitable ownership in the two entities, (4)\n\nuse of the same offices and employees, (5) use of one entity as a mere shell or conduit for\n\nthe affairs of the other, (6) inadequate capitalization, (7) disregard of corporate\n\nformalities, (8) lack of segregation of corporate records, and (9) identical directors and\n\nofficers. (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 538-539.) \"No one characteristic\n\ngoverns, but the courts must look at all the circumstances to determine whether the\n\ndoctrine should be applied.\" (Id. at p. 539.) The trial court's alter ego finding is reviewed\n\nfor substantial evidence. (Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) 210\n\nCal.App.2d 825, 837.)\n\n       McEwen's first argument challenging the court's finding that she is an alter ego of\n\nAMS rests on a faulty premise: there was no evidence that McEwen was anything more\n\nthan an employee of AMS. This is untrue. The only evidence presented at trial that\n\nMcEwen was an employee came from the testimony of Aksel and McEwen. The court\n\nfound such testimony unbelievable.\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f       To the contrary, Premium Stones presented substantial evidence supporting the\n\nconclusion that McEwen was an owner of AMS. Mauro testified that McEwen told him\n\nshe was an owner. McEwen had a company credit card, signed company checks,\n\nwithdrew money out of AMS's bank account, and attempted to make a payment from her\n\npersonal account on behalf of AMS. When Premium Stones and AMS were negotiating a\n\njoint venture, McEwen was a signatory on all the draft documents and mentioned by\n\nname in the documents. McEwen even admitted that she told people she was an owner of\n\nAMS.\n\n       Further, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports a unity of interest and\n\nownership between AMS and McEwen that the separate personalities of AMS and\n\nMcEwen do not in reality exist. In addition to the evidence offered to show McEwen was\n\nan owner of AMS, Premium Stones presented evidence that (1) McEwen used the AMS\n\ncredit card to buy personal items, such as clothing, groceries, and meals; (2) AMS's funds\n\nwere used to make mortgage payments for property not owned by AMS and Aksel had no\n\nknowledge of those payments; and (3) McEwen withdrew cash from AMS's bank account\n\nfor personal use. Also, the court noted that AMS never produced any corporate\n\ndocuments. Moreover, although asked several times regarding the capitalization of AMS\n\nat its creation, none of the witnesses questioned (Aksel and McEwen) were able to\n\nprovide coherent testimony about its capitalization, warranting the inference that the\n\ncompany was not sufficiently capitalized.\n\n       McEwen ignores most of this evidence. For the evidence she does acknowledge,\n\nMcEwen argues about the weight of the evidence. For example, she claims that Premium\n\n                                             22\n\fStones did not sufficiently cross-examine her about the credit card charges. Again, this\n\nargument goes to the weight of the evidence. Premium Stones raised the question of the\n\ncredit card charges in its examination of Aksel. McEwen tried to explain away the\n\nquestionable charges when she was questioned by her attorney, but the trial court did not\n\nbelieve her. In conducting a substantial evidence review, we must accept the fact finder's\n\ncredibility determinations. (See Johnson v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., supra,\n\n28 Cal.App.4th at p. 622.) As we discuss above, we cannot reweigh the evidence.\n\n(Reichardt v. Hoffman, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 766.) This is precisely what McEwen\n\nasks us to do.\n\n       Finally, substantial evidence supports the second prong necessary to invoke alter\n\nego liability. Here, it is apparent that AMS lacked funds. They owed Premium Stones\n\nover $100,000. If the court did not find McEwen was the alter ego of AMS, it leads to\n\nthe possibility that any judgment against AMS would go unsatisfied. While this in itself\n\ndoes not create an inequitable result, under the circumstances here, it is apparent that\n\nMcEwen's conduct at least partly led to AMS's financial woes. Put differently, a finding\n\nof no alter ego liability would sanction McEwen's behavior, which, in the words of the\n\ntrial court, consisted largely of treating AMS \"as her personal piggy bank.\" The trial\n\ncourt's finding of alter ego liability thus prevented an inequity.\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is reversed as to the claims for account stated and the award of\n\ntreble damages for the dishonored checks. The judgment is otherwise affirmed. We\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fremand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\n\nif necessary. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   HUFFMAN, Acting P.

However, they fail to provide us\n\nwith any semblance of the evidence admitted at trial to support the trial court's judgment,\n\nwhich is essential for a substantial evidence review. (See Ortega v. Pajaro Valley\n\nUnified School Dist. (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2280234\"><a href=\"/opinion/2280234/ortega-v-pajaro-valley-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The \"Statement of\n\nFacts\" section of the opening brief merely presents on overview of the procedural history\n\nof the dispute as well as a cursory explanation of the witnesses at trial. AMS and\n\nMcEwen do not supply us with the relevant facts based on the evidence admitted at trial.\n\nInstead, they merely present us with \"evidence\" and argument that support only their\n\nposition. This is improper and inappropriate, especially when AMS and McEwen have\n\n                                             2\n\fsubmitted the only brief in this matter. We therefore have provided a factual and\n\nprocedural history of this matter based on the record with minimal guidance from the\n\nopening brief.\n\n                                 The Operative Pleadings\n\n       Premium Stones brought suit against AMS, McEwen, Faber Stone, LLC (Faber),\n\nFBR Marble, Inc. (FBR), and Hikmet Aksel (Aksel) (AMS, McEwen, Faber, FBR, and\n\nAksel collectively referred to as Defendants) for breach of oral contract, goods sold and\n\ndelivered, open book account, account stated, and claim on dishonored checks. The\n\ngravamen of the complaint involved Premium Stones's contention that AMS failed to pay\n\nit pursuant to an oral consignment agreement. Premium Stones also alleged McEwen,\n\nFaber, FBR, and Aksel were all alter egos of AMS.\n\n       AMS brought a cross-complaint against Premium Stones, Mauro Pitanga (Mauro),\n\nand Claudia Pitanga (Claudia) for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation,\n\nintentional misrepresentation, accounting of joint venture, quantum meruit, and\n\npromissory estoppel. AMS's primary contention was that it entered into a joint venture\n\nwith Premium Stones and Premium Stones breached that agreement by failing to infuse\n\ncash into the joint venture and taking more than one-third of the profits of the joint\n\nventure. AMS also claimed Mauro and Claudia were employees of Premium Stones,\n\nwho acted on the company's behalf.\n\n       The claims in both the operative complaint and the cross-complaint were tried in a\n\nbench trial.\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\f                                    Premium Stones's Case\n\n          Mauro is president of Premium Stones. Premium Stones's business consists of\n\nexporting granite from Brazil and selling it on consignment. Premium Stones's typical\n\nconsignment agreement involves providing a retailer with granite, and the retailer selling\n\nthe granite to the consumer and paying Premium Stones its costs plus 50 percent of the\n\nprofit.\n\n          Premium Stones started operating in 2007. At that time, it was incorporated in\n\nFlorida under the name Premium Stones Corporation. However, Premium Stones\n\nCorporation's accountant, Derek Nakagawa (Nakagawa), advised Mauro to move the\n\ncompany to California because all of the company's business was there. Premium Stones\n\nmoved to California and was incorporated under the name \"Premium Stones Trading\n\nCorporation\" in 2008. Mauro added \"Trading\" to the company's name to make it \"a little\n\nbit different\" and to better represent its style of business. When Premium Stones moved\n\nto California, Nakagawa transferred all of Premium Stones Corporation's assets, debts,\n\nand liabilities to Premium Stones. Premium Stones continued to serve the same clients as\n\nPremium Stones Corporation and operated under previously existing consignment\n\nagreements entered into by Premium Stones Corporation.\n\n          In early 2007, Mauro's friend introduced him to McEwen. McEwen was the\n\nowner of Brazil Stones located at 7988 Miramar Road in San Diego. The physical\n\nlocation of Brazil Stones consisted of a spacious yard with \"slabs\" of material like granite\n\nas well as a large doublewide trailer containing an office, kitchen, and bathroom.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f         Premium Stones and Brazil Stones entered into a written consignment agreement\n\n(the Written Agreement).1 Under the Written Agreement, McEwen selected the granite\n\nshe wanted from Premium Stones based on the granite Premium Stones had available at\n\nthat time. Premium Stones then delivered the selected granite to Brazil Stones. Upon\n\ndelivery, McEwen inspected the granite to ensure that she received what she ordered and\n\nprovided Premium Stones with confirmation that she had received the material ordered.\n\nMauro informed McEwen of the cost of the granite. Brazil Stones then sold the granite\n\nand paid Premium Stones the cost plus 50 percent of the profit after the sale. Mauro\n\nreturned to Brazil Stones's warehouse every 15 days or so to check on the amount of\n\ngranite sold. McEwen sometimes provided Mauro with written confirmation of what was\n\nsold and for what price, and at other times, McEwen informed Mauro verbally of the\n\nsales.\n\n         Shortly after Premium Stones and Brazil Stones began doing business, Brazil\n\nStones changed its name to AMS. Mauro visited Brazil Stones's yard at 7988 Miramar\n\nRoad and saw that the yard contained a sign indicating that the company was now called\n\nAMS. Brazil Stones did not provide any written notice to Premium Stones that it was\n\nchanging its name nor did it ask Premium Stones to remove any of its unsold granite.\n\nMauro noticed that the employees were the same at AMS as they were at Brazil Stones.\n\nMcEwen told Mauro that she changed Brazil Stones's name to AMS because Brazil\n\nStones had owed \"a bunch of people\" money. However, she explained to Mauro that\n\n\n1     Although the Written Agreement was a trial exhibit that was admitted into\nevidence, AMS and McEwen did not include it in their appellant's appendix.\n                                             5\n\fAMS and Brazil Stones were the same company and AMS would continue to sell\n\nPremium Stones's granite. McEwen also informed Mauro that AMS was her company\n\nand she would continue to operate like nothing had changed.\n\n       When Brazil Stones changed its name to AMS, McEwen began working with\n\nAksel. Aksel was McEwen's partner and had an ownership interest in AMS. He also had\n\nan ownership interest in Faber and FBR, both of which operated similar businesses to\n\nAMS.2 Mauro met Aksel when he learned that Brazil Stones had changed its name to\n\nAMS.\n\n       At some point, AMS experienced financial difficulties and fell behind on its\n\npayments to Premium Stones. Premium Stones maintained an account statement that\n\nshowed invoices, relating to granite provided to AMS, which had been paid or partially\n\npaid. The account statement illustrated that Premium Stones had billed AMS a total of\n\n$230,237.22 and had an open balance of $119,191.62. The account statement was\n\ncreated by Nakagawa using a computer accounting system called QuickBooks.\n\nNakagawa created the account statement for AMS in his usual course of business by\n\ninputting information regarding the purchases of inventory, customer sales, deposits to\n\nthe bank, and payment of bills based on information provided to him, such as bills of\n\nlading, invoices, and purchase orders.\n\n       During the course of their business relationship, AMS provided Premium Stones\n\nwith four checks that were returned for insufficient funds. The first check, numbered\n\n\n2     Premium Stones unsuccessfully sued Faber and FBR as alter egos of AMS; thus,\nwe do not include any substantive discussion of Faber or FBR.\n                                            6\n\f1230, was made payable to Premium Stones in the amount of $6,500 and was dated\n\nFebruary 25, 2008. On the face of that check was a stamp stating: \"Return Reason - A\n\nNot Sufficient Funds.\" The second check, numbered 2077, was made payable to\n\nPremium Stones in the amount of $3,000 and was dated June 20, 2008. On the face of\n\nthat check was a stamp providing: \"Return Reason - S Refer to Maker.\" The third check,\n\nnumbered 2085, was made payable to Premium Stones in the amount of $6,112.71 and\n\nwas dated June 27, 2008. On the face of that check was a stamp avowing: \"Return\n\nReason - A Not Sufficient Funds.\" The fourth check, numbered 1038, was made payable\n\nto AMS in the amount of $800 and dated September 2008 (the day was illegible). On the\n\nface of that check was a stamp affirming: \"Return Reason - C Stop Payment.\" Premium\n\nStones provided additional evidence that it did not receive funds to cover any of the\n\nreturned checks.\n\n       McEwen also wrote a check, numbered 1045, on her personal account made\n\npayable to Premium Stones in the amount of $4,000 and was dated July 8, 2008. The\n\ncheck was returned for insufficient funds and bore the stamp on the face of the check\n\nstating: \"Return Reason – A Not Sufficient Funds.\" Premium Stones provided additional\n\nevidence that it did not receive funds to cover McEwen's returned check.\n\n       McEwen drove one of AMS's company cars, a BMW. She would use an AMS\n\ncredit card to buy gas. McEwen also used the AMS credit card to purchase: meals at\n\nrestaurants like Outback Steakhouse, McDonald's, and In-N-Out; supplies and materials\n\nfrom Home Depot; groceries, children's toys, clothing, and veterinary services for\n\nMcEwen's dog. AMS's bank records also indicated that mortgage payments were made\n\n                                             7\n\ffrom the account, but AMS did not have a mortgage. McEwen also caused AMS to make\n\na $2,000 payment to the Kabbalah Centre. In addition, AMS's bank records showed that\n\nchecks were written to McEwen and on McEwen's behalf in relation to real estate\n\ntransactions that did not involve AMS. Also, McEwen wrote a $5,000 check on behalf of\n\nAMS for rent.\n\n                                     Defendants' Case\n\n       Defendants challenged Premium Stones's case with four primary theories. First,\n\nthey argued they never did business with Premium Stones because Premium Stones was\n\nincorporated in 2008 after the dispute arose. Instead, Defendants contend they only did\n\nbusiness with Premium Stones Corporation, a Florida corporation that no longer existed\n\nat the time of the trial. Second, Defendants argued that all of Premium Stones's activities\n\nwere intended to fraudulently obtain work visas for Mauro and Claudia. The trial court\n\ndid not allow any evidence on this matter although Defendants tried numerous times to\n\noffer such evidence. Therefore, we omit any discussion of this theory. Third, Defendants\n\nclaimed Premium Stones's employees created purchase orders on AMS's computers; thus,\n\nthe purchase orders produced at trial were shams and did not originate from AMS.\n\nFinally, Defendants claimed that they paid Premium Stones far more money than\n\nPremium Stones was seeking in the suit. In other words, there was no open balance.\n\n       Aksel handled the \"financials\" for AMS. Aksel admitted that Premium Stones\n\nCorporation and AMS entered into an oral agreement, but characterized the agreement as\n\na joint venture. Aksel described the agreement as requiring Premium Stones Corporation\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\fto provide granite to AMS, which AMS would sell and pay Premium Stones Corporation\n\nits costs plus one-third of any profits.\n\n          Aksel, however, testified that the joint venture agreement never was reduced to\n\nwriting despite the parties' attempts to do so. In one of the draft agreements that Aksel\n\nbelieved McEwen drafted, the draft agreement made clear that liabilities AMS owed to\n\nPremium Stones in the amount of $119,998 would not be paid if the parties agreed to the\n\njoint venture. Although Aksel admitted the $119,998 amount came from AMS's\n\nQuickBooks system, he testified that its profit and loss statements were unreliable as\n\nwere some of AMS's inventory and sales reports. In other words, Aksel claimed the\n\n$119,998 listed as a liability AMS owed Premium Stones was not accurate.\n\n          Aksel testified that when he made payments to Premium Stones, they were not\n\nrelated to any invoice. He simply made payments to Premium Stones by check when\n\nPremium Stones requested a check, but the understanding was that Premium Stones\n\nwould not deposit the check until AMS collected the funds from AMS's customers.\n\nAksel testified that AMS had a record of the total amount of payments made to Premium\n\nStones, but AMS did not produce any such record. Aksel agreed this was true despite the\n\nfact that AMS's accounting software (QuickBooks) had the ability to produce such a\n\nreport.\n\n          McEwen testified that she sometimes told people she was an owner of AMS\n\nbecause it was easier to explain than her claim that her mother was an owner and\n\nMcEwen had power of attorney over her mother's assets. McEwen took the position that\n\nshe was only AMS's employee. She also testified that all her credit card charges with\n\n                                               9\n\fAMS's credit card were for business purposes. However, McEwen admitted that she used\n\nAMS's bank accounts for personal expenses, but she reimbursed those accounts. She\n\nprovided no documents to support this testimony.\n\n        In addition, McEwen explained that the $72,787 of cash withdrawals from AMS's\n\nbank account was used to pay employees and vendors. McEwen also claimed she made\n\nseveral payments in cash to Premium Stones, but did not have any documents proving\n\nsuch.\n\n                                 The Trial Court's Findings\n\n        After hearing closing arguments, the trial court granted Premium Stones's motion\n\nfor a nonsuit on the cross-complaint. In granting the motion, the court noted that the \"the\n\ncross-complainants, in trying to establish the elements of their causes of action lack total\n\ncredibility that there was any agreement whatsoever.\"\n\n        The trial court asked Premium Stones's counsel to draft a statement of decision\n\nand provided the following guidance:\n\n           \"My ruling in this case is and will turn on the credibility of the\n           witnesses. [¶] I have listened to the testimony of the Defendants in\n           this case, and I find each of the individuals to be incredible. I have\n           never – well, that's not true, I can't say 'never,' but the testimony of\n           Ms. McEwen is incredible, her conduct inappropriate, he-she. Well,\n           anyway, I have listened to the explanation of the documents which\n           she purported to deny. [¶] The Defendants did not produce any\n           documents other than attack the Plaintiff's documents and say that\n           they were unreal and unreliable. There were no corporate\n           documents expressed. So, in terms of credibility, I have a list that I\n           will be utilizing when we go review the statement of decisions that\n           are proposed. [¶] As to the alter ego allegations. My tentative is\n           this that judgment clearly is against AMS Stones Warehouse, Inc., a\n           California corporation. It is [clear] to me that Carla McEwen is, in\n           fact, and has, in fact used AMS Stones Warehouse Inc. as an alter\n\n                                              10\n\f             ego. She's used the corporation as her personal piggy bank. The\n             cash deposits, the cash that's been withdrawn from ATM, the\n             purchases for clothes, food, all were for personal purposes, all by\n             someone who had the unfettered access to the accounts and she used\n             those freely. And I've gone through the analysis and the criteria and\n             I think that if there was any case that has met the alter ego criteria,\n             Ms. McEwen meets that criteria with AMS Stones.\"\n\n       Premium Stones submitted a proposed statement of decision. The trial court\n\nsigned the proposed statement of decision with minor changes not relevant to any of the\n\nissues raised here. Defendants filed an objection to the court's statement of decision\n\narguing that Defendants were denied an opportunity to propose a statement of decision or\n\ncomment on Premium Stones's proposed statement of decision. The court subsequently\n\nentered judgment. AMS and McEwen appealed.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n                                                I\n\n                           AMS AND MCEWEN'S CONTENTIONS\n\n       AMS and McEwen contend that substantial evidence does not support the\n\njudgment. Specifically, they maintain: (1) the evidence showed Premium Stones lacked\n\nstanding to sue and (2) the evidence was insufficient to show a breach of oral agreement,\n\na cause of action for goods sold and delivered, a claim for open book account, a cause of\n\naction for account stated, a claim on dishonored checks, and that McEwen was AMS's\n\nalter ego.\n\n                                    A. Standard of Review\n\n       \"In reviewing the sufficiency of evidence on appeal, we resolve all conflicts in\n\nfavor of the prevailing party and we indulge all legitimate and reasonable inferences to\n\n                                               11\n\fuphold the verdict if possible. 'It is an elementary, but often overlooked principle of law,\n\nthat when a verdict is attacked as being unsupported, the power of the appellate court\n\nbegins and ends with a determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence,\n\ncontradicted or uncontradicted, which will support the conclusion reached by the\n\njury. . . .'

They do not provide us with\n\nthe evidence that ostensibly supports the judgment and explain how this evidence\n\nultimately falls short in supporting the judgment. Instead, AMS and McEwen focus on\n\nevidence they provided during trial. However, the trial court determined that their\n\nevidence, especially Aksel's and McEwen's testimony, was unbelievable. We cannot\n\nreweigh the evidence as AMS and McEwen impliedly urge us to do. (See Scott v. Pacific\n\nGas & Electric Co.

Premium Stones's Standing\n\n      AMS and McEwen contend that Premium Stones lacks standing to sue. They\n\nargue that any business AMS conducted was with Premium Stones Corporation, a Florida\n\ncorporation, that was \"dissolved at all times during said litigation.\" As such, AMS and\n\nMcEwen contend that Premium Stones Corporation was the real party in interest, and\n\nPremium Stones, a California corporation, was not the proper plaintiff. We are not\n\npersuaded.\n\n      Mauro testified that, on Nakagawa's suggestion, he moved Premium Stones\n\nCorporation from Florida to California. All of Premium Stones Corporation's business\n\nwas in California. He renamed the entity Premium Stones Trading Corporation. When\n\nPremium Stones Corporation moved to California, Mauro, through Nakagawa,\n\ntransferred all its assets, debts, and liabilities to Premium Stones. The new Premium\n\nStones continued to serve the same clients as the former Premium Stones Corporation\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\fand operated under previously existing consignment agreements entered into by Premium\n\nStones Corporation.\n\n       Further, it was apparent that Aksel and McEwen were aware that Premium Stones\n\nCorporation was operating as Premium Stones. They tried to negotiate a joint venture\n\nagreement between Premium Stones and AMS. Indeed, AMS cross-complained against\n\nPremium Stones for breach of an alleged joint venture agreement.\n\n       In short, substantial evidence shows that Premium Stones Corporation moved to\n\nCalifornia, changed its name and continued to do business with the same customers as\n\nbefore. And Aksel and McEwen drew no distinction between Premium Stones\n\nCorporation and Premium Stones in their business dealings, except that they attempted to\n\nnegotiate a joint venture with Premium Stones only.\n\n       AMS and McEwen contend, even if we determine Premium Stones assumed all\n\nthe liabilities and assets of Premium Stones Corporation, Premium Stones still lacked\n\nstanding to sue on behalf of Premium Stones Corporation. (See J.C. Peacock, Inc. v.\n\nHasko (1960) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192884\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192884/jc-peacock-inc-v-hasko/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Peacock, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192884\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192884/jc-peacock-inc-v-hasko/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the Court of Appeal determined that\n\nthe plaintiff, the surviving postmerger corporation, could not initiate a lawsuit in the\n\nname of the merged out corporation. Having done so in the name of a corporation that no\n\nlonger existed, the plaintiff \"was not entitled to the extraordinary and summary\n\nproceeding of attachment.\" (Id. at p. 152.) Here, Premium Stones did not bring suit in\n\nthe name of a nonexistent corporation. In contrast, Premium Stones was abundantly clear\n\n                                             14\n\fduring its case-in-chief, consistent with its complaint, that it was pursuing damages based\n\non its business relationship with AMS, not Premium Stones Corporation's relationship\n\nwith AMS. Unlike the plaintiff in J.C. Peacock, Premium Stones did not file numerous\n\ncomplaints in the name of a merged out corporation while consistently representing to the\n\ncourt that the merged out company still legally existed. Premium Stones proceeded with\n\nthe instant action at all times as Premium Stones. It never represented to the court that\n\nPremium Stones Corporation was the proper plaintiff. In addition, Premium Stones was\n\nan incorporated California corporation prior to filing suit. J.C. Peacock therefore is not\n\ninstructive here. Premium Stones had standing.\n\n                    C. Breach of Oral Contract and Common Counts\n\n       AMS and McEwen next contend that substantial evidence does not support the\n\ntrial court's finding in favor of Premium Stones on its causes of action for breach of oral\n\ncontract, goods sold and delivered, and open book account. We disagree.\n\n       To state a cause of action for breach of contract, a party must plead the existence\n\nof a contract, his or her performance of the contract or excuse for nonperformance, the\n\ndefendant's breach, and resulting damage. (Harris v. Rudin, Richman & Appel (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307.) Here, Premium Stones offered sufficient evidence to establish\n\neach of these elements.\n\n       Premium Stones Corporation and Brazil Stones entered into a written consignment\n\ncontract whereby Premium Stones Corporation would provide Brazil Stones with slabs of\n\ngranite, and after Brazil Stones sold the slabs, it would pay Premium Stones Corporation\n\nits costs plus half the profits. When Brazil Stones changed its name to AMS, McEwen,\n\n                                             15\n\fon behalf of AMS, confirmed that AMS would continue to do business with Premium\n\nStones Corporation under the terms of the written agreement. Premiums Stones\n\nCorporation subsequently changed its name to Premium Stones Trading Corporation and\n\ncontinued to do business with AMS.\n\n       AMS and McEwen argue there was no contract because Premium Stones did not\n\nprove a \"meeting of the minds\": there was a disagreement between the parties regarding\n\nthe amount AMS would pay Premiums Stones. \"Evidence\" of this disagreement is found\n\nin the testimony of Aksel and McEwen. The court, however, determined their respective\n\ntestimony was unreliable. The court believed Mauro's testimony that McEwen agreed to\n\nan oral contract according to the terms testified to by Mauro. One witness's testimony\n\ncan establish substantial evidence. (See In re Marriage of Mix, supra, 14 Cal.3d at\n\np. 614.) Despite the urging of AMS and McEwen, we cannot reevaluate witness\n\ncredibility or reweigh evidence on appeal. (Leff, supra, 33 Cal.3d at p. 518.)\n\n       We also are satisfied that substantial evidence shows Premium Stones proved its\n\nperformance under the oral contract. It offered Mauro's testimony regarding the delivery\n\nof slabs of granite to AMS as well as purchase orders from AMS confirming the granite\n\nreceived, Premium Stones's invoices, and other documentary evidence showing that\n\nPremium Stones delivered granite slabs to AMS. McEwen's and AMS's challenge goes\n\nto the weight of the evidence considered by the trial court. They argue that AMS did not\n\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fcreate the purchase orders, some of the documents were illegible,3 and other documents\n\nwere unreliable. It bears repeating that we do not reweigh the evidence on appeal. (Leff,\n\nsupra, 33 Cal.3d at p. 518.)\n\n       In addition, there was substantial evidence that AMS breached the oral contract\n\nand Premium Stones was damaged. Premium Stones offered an account statement\n\nshowing an unpaid balance of $119,191.62. This amount was close to the amount of\n\nliability AMS owed Premium Stones as set forth in a document created by McEwen\n\nbased on AMS's records. Further, Premium Stones provided evidence through\n\nNakawaga's testimony regarding the creation of the account statement and how the\n\noutstanding balance was calculated.\n\n       AMS and McEwen challenge the account statement, arguing that it contained the\n\ndate \"August 1, 2011\" and time \"6:11 p.m.\" on the top left corner indicating it was made\n\n\"nearly eleven months after the lawsuit was filed.\" However, this is an argument that\n\nneeded to be made to the trial court. AMS and McEwen had the opportunity to probe this\n\nissue during the cross-examination of Mauro and Nakagawa. They did not sufficiently do\n\nso, and there is nothing in the record supporting their argument now. Perhaps, the date\n\nand time stamp on the document indicate when that spreadsheet was printed. Maybe the\n\ndate and time stamp are incorrect. On this record, we do not know. As such, we accept\n\n\n\n\n3     There only appears to have been one document admitted into evidence where\nDefendants objected that it was illegible, but the court admitted only the first page of the\ndocument, which was legible.\n                                             17\n\fthe trial court's reliance on the account statement and consider it substantial evidence of\n\nthe amount AMS owed Premium Stones.\n\n       Like Premium Stones's claim for breach of oral contract, we are satisfied that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the trial court's finding in favor of Premium Stones on its\n\ncauses of action for goods sold and delivered and open book. These claims are common\n\ncounts. (4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Pleading, § 553, p. 680.) \"The only\n\nessential [elements] of a common count are '(1) the statement of indebtedness in a certain\n\nsum, (2) the consideration, i.e., goods sold, work done, etc., and (3) nonpayment.'\n\n[Citation.]\" (Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Zerin (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284520\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284520/farmers-ins-exchange-v-zerin/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 460.) Here, the\n\nsame evidence that supports Premium Stones's claim for breach of oral contract supports\n\nthese common counts.\n\n       In summary, substantial evidence supports the trial court's findings in favor of\n\nPremium Stones that it proved its claims for breach of oral contract, goods sold and\n\ndelivered, and open book.\n\n                                    D. Account Stated\n\n       \"The essential elements of an account stated are: (1) previous transactions\n\nbetween the parties establishing a relationship of debtor and creditor; (2) an agreement\n\nbetween the parties, express or implied, on the amount due from the debtor to the\n\ncreditor; (3) a promise by the debtor, express or implied, to pay the amount due.\" (Zinn\n\nv. Fred R. Bright Co. (1969) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">271</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">597</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 600.) AMS and McEwen assert that\n\nthe evidence does support the second element of this cause of action. We agree.\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\f       There is nothing in the record indicating an agreement between the parties that\n\nAMS would pay Premium Stones a set amount. Although Premium Stones's spreadsheet\n\nand AMS's own documents indicate amounts owed that are close to the same number,\n\nthey do not match. No other evidence offered at trial shows that the parties agreed on the\n\nexact amount AMS owed Premium Stones. Thus, substantial evidence does not support\n\nthe trial court's finding that Premium Stones proved its cause of action for account stated.\n\n                                E. The Dishonored Checks\n\n       Premium Stones brought claims based on five dishonored checks. Although we\n\nare satisfied that Premium Stones proved that each check was returned for insufficient\n\nfunds, we agree with AMS and McEwen that Premium Stones was not entitled to treble\n\ndamages under Civil Code section 1719, subdivision (a)(2). That subdivision allows the\n\npayee to recover treble damages capped at $1,500 if the payee sends written demand by\n\ncertified mail to the person who passed the check advising him or her that if he or she\n\ndoes not pay the amount of the check within 30 days from the date of the written demand,\n\nhe or she could be liable for treble damages. (Civ. Code, § 1719, subd. (a)(2).)\n\n       There is nothing in the record indicating that Premium Stones proved that they\n\nmade the required mailings. We note that copies of what purports to be the required\n\nmailings are attached to Premium Stones's complaint, but neither letter was admitted at\n\n\n\n\n                                             19\n\ftrial. Without proof of the mailings, Premium Stones was not entitled to treble damages\n\nand the judgment as to the award of treble damages must be reversed.4\n\n                                       F. Alter Ego\n\n       The trial court found that McEwen was the alter ego of AMS. McEwen\n\nchallenges this finding, arguing it is not supported by substantial evidence. Specifically,\n\nMcEwen argues that there was no evidence that she was anything more than an employee\n\nof AMS. She also contends that, even if she was an owner of AMS, there was no\n\nevidence supporting any of the factors warranting an alter ego finding. We disagree.\n\n       A corporation is ordinarily regarded as a legal entity, separate and distinct from its\n\nshareholders, officers, and directors. (Sonora Diamond Corp. v. Superior Court ( 2000)\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2250866\"><a href=\"/opinion/2250866/sonora-diamond-corp-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (Sonora).) Nonetheless, a corporate identity may be\n\ndisregarded \"where an abuse of the corporate privilege justifies holding the equitable\n\nownership of a corporation liable for the actions of the corporation.\" (Ibid.) Alter ego\n\nliability affords relief when \"some conduct amounting to bad faith makes it inequitable\n\nfor the corporate owner to hide behind the corporate form.\" (Id. at p. 539.)\n\n\n\n\n4      AMS and McEwen insist that Premium Stones was awarded damages equaling the\nentire open balance, which included the amount of the returned checks. AMS and\nMcEwen therefore argue that any damages awarded for the dishonored checks are\nimproper \"double\" damages. We disagree. The judgment does not award Premium\nStones both the amount of the open book in addition to the amount of the checks.\nInstead, in regard to the dishonored checks, the court awarded Premium Stones treble\ndamages under Civil Code section 1719, subdivision (a)(2) only. These damages are in\naddition to the amount of the checks, which the court did not award Premium Stones in\naddition to the damages for the open book. The treble damages would have been proper\nif Premium Stones had proven the required mailing occurred.\n                                             20\n\f       Two conditions must be met to find alter ego liability: (1) \"[T]here must be such a\n\nunity of interest and ownership between the corporation and its equitable owner that the\n\nseparate personalities of the corporation and the shareholder do not in reality exist\"; and\n\n(2) if the acts in question are treated as those of only the corporation, the result will be\n\ninequitable. (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at p. 538.)\n\n       Among the factors to be considered in applying the alter ego doctrine are\n\n(1) commingling of funds and other assets, (2) the holding out by one entity that it is\n\nliable for the debts of the other, (3) identical equitable ownership in the two entities, (4)\n\nuse of the same offices and employees, (5) use of one entity as a mere shell or conduit for\n\nthe affairs of the other, (6) inadequate capitalization, (7) disregard of corporate\n\nformalities, (8) lack of segregation of corporate records, and (9) identical directors and\n\nofficers. (Sonora, supra, 83 Cal.App.4th at pp. 538-539.) \"No one characteristic\n\ngoverns, but the courts must look at all the circumstances to determine whether the\n\ndoctrine should be applied.\" (Id. at p. 539.) The trial court's alter ego finding is reviewed\n\nfor substantial evidence. (Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co. (1962) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2211258\"><a href=\"/opinion/2211258/associated-vendors-inc-v-oakland-meat-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837.)\n\n       McEwen's first argument challenging the court's finding that she is an alter ego of\n\nAMS rests on a faulty premise: there was no evidence that McEwen was anything more\n\nthan an employee of AMS. This is untrue. The only evidence presented at trial that\n\nMcEwen was an employee came from the testimony of Aksel and McEwen. The court\n\nfound such testimony unbelievable.\n\n\n\n                                              21\n\f       To the contrary, Premium Stones presented substantial evidence supporting the\n\nconclusion that McEwen was an owner of AMS. Mauro testified that McEwen told him\n\nshe was an owner. McEwen had a company credit card, signed company checks,\n\nwithdrew money out of AMS's bank account, and attempted to make a payment from her\n\npersonal account on behalf of AMS. When Premium Stones and AMS were negotiating a\n\njoint venture, McEwen was a signatory on all the draft documents and mentioned by\n\nname in the documents. McEwen even admitted that she told people she was an owner of\n\nAMS.\n\n       Further, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports a unity of interest and\n\nownership between AMS and McEwen that the separate personalities of AMS and\n\nMcEwen do not in reality exist. In addition to the evidence offered to show McEwen was\n\nan owner of AMS, Premium Stones presented evidence that (1) McEwen used the AMS\n\ncredit card to buy personal items, such as clothing, groceries, and meals; (2) AMS's funds\n\nwere used to make mortgage payments for property not owned by AMS and Aksel had no\n\nknowledge of those payments; and (3) McEwen withdrew cash from AMS's bank account\n\nfor personal use. Also, the court noted that AMS never produced any corporate\n\ndocuments. Moreover, although asked several times regarding the capitalization of AMS\n\nat its creation, none of the witnesses questioned (Aksel and McEwen) were able to\n\nprovide coherent testimony about its capitalization, warranting the inference that the\n\ncompany was not sufficiently capitalized.\n\n       McEwen ignores most of this evidence. For the evidence she does acknowledge,\n\nMcEwen argues about the weight of the evidence. For example, she claims that Premium\n\n                                             22\n\fStones did not sufficiently cross-examine her about the credit card charges. Again, this\n\nargument goes to the weight of the evidence. Premium Stones raised the question of the\n\ncredit card charges in its examination of Aksel. McEwen tried to explain away the\n\nquestionable charges when she was questioned by her attorney, but the trial court did not\n\nbelieve her. In conducting a substantial evidence review, we must accept the fact finder's\n\ncredibility determinations. (See Johnson v. Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., supra,\n\n28 Cal.App.4th at p. 622.) As we discuss above, we cannot reweigh the evidence.\n\n(Reichardt v. Hoffman, supra, 52 Cal.App.4th at p. 766.) This is precisely what McEwen\n\nasks us to do.\n\n       Finally, substantial evidence supports the second prong necessary to invoke alter\n\nego liability. Here, it is apparent that AMS lacked funds. They owed Premium Stones\n\nover $100,000. If the court did not find McEwen was the alter ego of AMS, it leads to\n\nthe possibility that any judgment against AMS would go unsatisfied. While this in itself\n\ndoes not create an inequitable result, under the circumstances here, it is apparent that\n\nMcEwen's conduct at least partly led to AMS's financial woes. Put differently, a finding\n\nof no alter ego liability would sanction McEwen's behavior, which, in the words of the\n\ntrial court, consisted largely of treating AMS \"as her personal piggy bank.\" The trial\n\ncourt's finding of alter ego liability thus prevented an inequity.\n\n                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is reversed as to the claims for account stated and the award of\n\ntreble damages for the dishonored checks. The judgment is otherwise affirmed. We\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\fremand this matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,\n\nif necessary. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   HUFFMAN, Acting P.
